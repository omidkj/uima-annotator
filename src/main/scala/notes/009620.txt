History of Present Illness:
69yo F with ESRD on HD, CAD, DM, HTN, CHF who was recently
admitted with decreased Hct and chest pain.  During the
admission, the pt received an EGD which demonstrated GAVE
(watermelon stomach) s/p APC (Argon Laser).  She received 2units
of PRBCs during the previous admission.  The pt also has a
history of colonic polyps from c-scope in [**2152**] s/p polypectomy.
The pt reports she has been feeling well since her last
admission.  The pt had been tolerating PO diet without
difficulty.  She had a "normal" BM this AM which was described
as [**Doctor Last Name 352**] in color, formed, without blood clots or streaks or any
odor.  She subsequently had two BM at 14:00 and 16:00 which were
described as maroon colored, watery stools with significant
blood in the bowel.  The pt has not had a BM since that time.
During this time, the pt admits to some amount of LH and
dizziness, especially with change in position.  However she
denies any chest pain, palpitations, sob, falls, HA, change in
vision, numbness, weakness, tingling or loc.  She also denies
any abdominal pain, n/v or change in diet/appetite.  No f/c/r,
however the pt admits to occasional night sweats and occurs only
after HD.  The night sweats are significant enough to force her
to change her pajamas and sheets.  The pt denies any weight
change.  The pt denies any recent use of NSAIDS.
.
In the ED, 2x pIV were placed, the pt was given protonix 40mg
IVx1 and she was given 1 unit or PRBC.  The pt also received a
NGL which was found to be negative. (no blood with suction and
neg lavage).  GI was consulted from the ED who recommend NPO
overnight and bowel prep tomorrow for EGD/Colonoscopy the
following day.  Renal was also consulted in the ED and has
arranged for the pt to remain on her usual Mon, Wed, Fri
schedule of HD.

Past Medical History:
1. Type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by nephropathy and
neuropathy.
2. ESRD on HD since [**November 2153**]
3. CAD: suspected by stress test in [**2153-5-22**], not reperfused.
4. CHF: TTE on [**2153-11-1**]. It showed a LVEF of 60 to 70% with 3+
MR and 2+ TR.
5. Anemia: Felt to be multifactorial from ESRD and also guiac
positive. Pt had a colonoscopy on [**2153-8-7**] significant for two
nonbleeding polyps in the sigmoid colon. She also had an EGD on
the same date which was significant for erythema, edema, and
erosion in the antrum compatible with gastritis in addition to
erythema in the proximal bulb compatible with duodenitis. No
bleeding was noted.  EGD has since demonstated GAVE on 2'[**53**].
6. Occult GI bleed [**7-/2153**] with studies as above
7. Gout

Social History:
Pt lives alone in an [**Hospital3 **] community. She has a
visiting nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 13222**]. Son lives close by and helps
mother. [**Name (NI) **] ETOH, tobacco, or drugs.


Family History:
[**Name (NI) 1094**] son and daughter have DM. Her son also has HTN. She has no
family history of CAD.


Physical Exam:
VS in ED: Tc: 98.9, HR: 104 -> 111 sitting up, BP: 141/60 -> 154
systolic, RR: 20, SaO2: 100% (orthostatics measured while
getting 1 unit of PRBCs).
GEN: well nutritioned elderly AA female in NAD, comfortable, no
accessory muscle use, conversing fluently in full sentences.
HEENT: EOMI, anicteric, mmm, op clear
NECK: no appreciable JVD
CV: tachycardia, s1, s2, ?1/6 SEM
CHEST: CTA bilaterally
ABD: obese, soft, NT, ND, BS+, ventral hernia
RECTAL: External non-bleeding hemorrhoids, brown guaiac positive
stool.
EXT: L UE fistula with thrill.
NEURO: A+O x3, strength 5/5 bilaterally in UE, LE not tested.
Gait not assessed.


Pertinent Results:
EGD [**2154-1-10**]:
Esophagus: Normal mucosa.
Stomach: Linear streaks of erythema of the mucosa with contact
bleeding and in a watermelon distribution was noted in the
antrum. These findings are compatible with GAVE. An Argon-Plasma
Coagulator was applied for hemostasis successfully.
Duodenum: Normal mucosa was noted from the duodenum to the
proximal jejunum. There were no blood or any bleeding lesions.
Impression: Erythema in the antrum compatible with GAVE s/p APC
.
EGD [**2154-1-22**]:
Impression: Erythema and congestion in the duodenal bulb
consistent with duodenitis. Erythema and congestion in the
antrum compatible with GAVE
Small angioectasias in the jejunum without evidence of bleeding
Recommendations: Protonix 40 mg Twice daily
Capsule endoscopy
.
Colonoscopy [**2154-1-22**]:
Impression: Scant stool mixed in with prep liquid in the colon
Findings do not explain bleeding.
Recommendations: Source of bleeding not identified, recommend
capsule endoscopy
.

Brief Hospital Course:
69yo F with ESRD on HD, CAD, DM, HTN, CHF who was recently
admitted with anemia and found to have GAVE on EGD presents with
marroon stools.
.
#. Anemia: The pt has baseline anemia that is multifactorial
(secondary to Renal failure as well as iron deficiency from
prior GIB). However this acute [**Month (only) **] in Hct (29 at discharge in
[**2154-1-11**] to 22 in ED), is most likely secondary to GIB.  As to
the source of the GIB, this is most likely LGIB given the neg NG
Lavage and maroon colored stools, however her history of GAVE is
concerning for a possible UGIB.  Although the pt is currently
hemodynamically stable without any evidence of orthostatics, we
will observe in MICU for concern of UGIB. She had received
1UPRBC in ED. MICU course of 1 day-pt was HD stable throughout
course, received 2UPRBC for HCT 24.2 during HD. Pt was called
out to floor the following day. Medicine floor course
uncomplicated. Pt remained HD stable. Remained on PPI [**Hospital1 **]. Per
GI EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] essentially unremarkable and did not account for
bleeding during this admission. Given findings and EGD/[**Last Name (un) **],
proceeded with capsule study.
Further work up included checking hemolysis labs (LDH, T-bili),
which were normal. She was continued on Epo and Fe supplements
per HD. No further blood transfusions were needed, she remained
HD stable throughout her admission.

2.  CV:
A. Coronaries: No signs or sx of acute ischemia including ECG
without acute changes.
Pt was noted to have PVCs on tele with few episodes of short
6beat runs of NSVT, however pt was asymptomatic throughout these
episodes. Electrolytes were repleted carefully, no ischemic
changes noted on EKG. Pt's BB was re-initiated on [**1-21**] in
setting of HTN and stable GIB. Lipitor was continued. No aspirin
given pt's allergy history and GIB.
B. Pump: The pt has hx of CHF with preserved EF of 60-70% per
echo on [**2153-11-1**] suggesting diastolic dysfxn. Pt currently
appears euvolemic.  Pt did not have any syptoms or signs of CHF
exacerbation during this admission.
C. Rhythm: NSR to sinus tach.
She did not develop any dysrhythmias and remained stable, well
rate controlled on her BB.

3.  ESRD: on HD since [**November 2153**]
renal followed pt throughout course, HD MWF. Continued
nephrocaps, calcium acetate, Epo

5.  Gout: R finger pain- Her pain was well controlled, per
finger films c/w tissue edema, no evidence of fracture.
Continued allopurinol and colchicine renally dosed. She was also
given oxycodone for 5 days upon discharge until she could follow
up with her primary care physician.
