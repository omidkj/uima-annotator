Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
PCA stroke

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
HPI: The pt is a 76-year-old woman R handed woman with end stage
PD, Sz disorder and dementia who is transferred from OSH for
further management of her "PCA stroke and other medical
problems."

According to transfer records (incomplete at best), it appears
that on [**2173-8-2**] she had a ? Sz at her NH. She was brought to the
[**Hospital 4199**] Hospital ED, where VS were 93/54, O2 sat of 85% on
unknown amount of O2. Due to "difficulty" maintaing O2 sats, she
was intubated in the ED. Of note, was also found to have small
amount of coffee ground emesis. Course was complicated by R PNX
after a subclavian line placement. At this point, she was
admitted to [**Hospital1 8**] ICU for "? shock". Her course was
complicated by R PNX, VAP, severe hypertension, then
hypotension,
electrographic evidence of Sz, dropping HCT and acute stroke on
[**8-7**]. She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for further managment and
evaluation of the stroke and medical problems.

On admission to [**Hospital 8**] hospital ICU, it appears that patient
was noted to have elevated WBC to 24K and CXR w/ ? LLL
infiltrate. For this she was started on Vancomycin/Cefepime for
/
aspiration PNA. Subsequent ET suction tube SpCx grew out MRSA.
As
respiratory status improved, intubation was planned, however
patient had persistently "altered mental status." EEG was
performed that showed "moderate number of bursts and runs of
epileptiform activity in L parietal region and becoming more
generalized.." Given this, her Keppra dose was increased from
250mg [**Hospital1 **] to 750mg [**Hospital1 **]. She remained w/o improvedment, and on
[**8-7**]
she was given 1g of ativan IV, and loaded w/ 500mg of Dilantin.
Given that no improvement was noted, she underwent a NCHCT on
[**8-7**]. This showed a new (compared to [**8-2**] HCT) L hypodensity in L
PCA territory w/ L cerebellar hemishpere hypodense focus in the
L
cerebellum. No mass effect or hemorrhage was noted. Given this
she was started on ASA 81mg and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management. Of note, she had episodes of hypertension on [**8-4**] abd
[**8-5**] to max of 240s/140s. This was felt to be due to pain from
chest tube, treated w/ labetalol, morphine and captopril. There
was report (verbal) that patient was felt to be in HF and thus
received lasix IV, with signficant diuresis and episode of
hypotension to 90s systolic. She was resuscitaed w/ IVF w/ SBPs
returning to 120s. There was also report of elevated Troponin to
0.83, however, no documentation was provided. Her ECGs were
sinus
tachycardia with PACs. On [**8-7**] she was also noted to have green,
loose stools, Cdiff neg x1.

She had been on Zonisomide for ? Tremors, but has been tx for Sz
disorder with this as well. The dose had been increased by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] as a neurology consultant at [**Hospital6 12736**] for
a
series of "possible convulsions." - desribed as becoming
unresponsive, shaking and vomiting in front of her husband. At
this time [**7-21**] she was also started on Keppra 250mg [**Hospital1 **]. Per
that
note, prior MRIs were remarkable for b/l GP atrophy,
mineralizatonof BG on b/l and cerebellar midline atrophy.

During her last visit with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 951**], [**3-11**], she was unable to do
so very much herself or provide much history. She needed help in
order to get out of the car. She has had frequent falls and
episodes of LOC. She sleeps much of the day. She requires
assisst
w/ ADLs.

Exam at that time was notable for being alert, mostly with eyes
closed but following simplevoice commands. No spontaneous
speech.
Disoriented to date/place, but knew her husbands name, poor
recall and naming. She also had facial hypomimia, monotone and
hypophonic speech, mild UE rigidity and nl LE tone. Flx
contractures of
the left hand, RAMs impaired and slow heel taps. She could arise
easily and quickly from the chair without assistance, gait was
slow.

She was admitted to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital [**Date range (1) 46278**]/09 with ? seizure.
Head CT was "negative," her zonegran was increased to 50 mg q
AM,
100 mg at night.

ROS could not be obtained.

Past Medical History:
*Multiple falls - First episode in Summer [**2168**] - found
unresponsive on kitchen floor, woke up in minutes - single
episode not worked up extensively; second episode [**2170-5-13**] -
found down, extensive w/u at [**Hospital1 2025**] d/c [**2170-5-25**] with no known
etiology and plan for Holter; [**5-31**] - found down with LOC ended
up going to [**Hospital1 2025**] MICU for unclear reasons: (-) EEG, (-) [**Name (NI) 1608**]
*Parkinson's disease x 18 years- followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 951**] as
outpt.
*h/o asthma/?COPD- dx at [**Hospital1 2025**] with occasional albuterol
*Seizure disorder, hx of head trauma at age 3, Sz since 5-6
years.

Lives at home with her husband until increased
episodes of Sz. Currently lives in [**Location **]. Spends most of time
sleeping, dependent on ADLs.
