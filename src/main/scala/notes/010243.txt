Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2106-11-27**] - Synchronized electrical cardioversion
[**2106-11-29**] - AVNRT ablation


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 77 year old male with medical history that
includes non-ischemic cardiomyopathy thought to be secondary to
velcade/rituxan (now with normalized left ventricular function),
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on coumadin, supraventricular
tachycardia,  severe tricuspid regurgitation, ESRD secondary to
waldenstroms macroglobulinemia, and metastatic prostate cancer
who is transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital with hypotension and
supraventricular tachycardia.  For the past couple weeks he
reports worsening dyspnea. At baseline his functional status is
limited as he becomes dyspniec with ambulation of 10-20feet.
Lately, however he becomes short of breath just with
transitioning from sitting to standing or any ambulation. He
also endorses episodes of waking up at night feeling very short
of breath. He also endorses worsening lower extremity edema but
is not clear if his weight has changed. He denies chest pain,
fever, chills. He reports stable bone pain related to his
metastatic prostate cancer.  At dialysis this past week, he was
felt to be volume overloaded and underwent extra ultrafiltration
with removal of 6.5kg Tuesday, 2.5kg Wednesday, and 1kg Thursday
with some improvement in his breathing and lower extremity
edema. Per notes, he usually tolerates a blood pressure in the
80s during dialysis.
.
He is followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] for cardiomyopathy and was referred
to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Month (only) **] for evaluation of supraventricular
tachycardia. In [**5-/2106**], he underwent successful DCCV for atrial
fibrillation. During the procedure, he went into
supraventricular tachycardia that did not respond to vagal
maneuvers but broke with adenosine. Since that time he has been
noted during dialysis session to be in SVT, limiting fluid
removal. He underwent Holter monotoring where he was
predominantly in an ectopic atrial rhythm with  episodes up to
14hrs in duration of atrial tachycardia. He was seen by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Month (only) **] and was started on amiodarone after declining
invasive procedures to further characterize/treat his rhythm.
.
He presented to [**Hospital **] hospital on [**2106-11-26**] complaining of
generalized weakness and fatigue where initial vitals were 98.2
82/53, HR 129, and 98%RA. EKG revealed regular narrow complex
tachycardia. He was felt to be volume overloaded on exam. He
underwent hemodialysis on Saturday with removal of 1kg of fluid.
Cardiology recommended starting dobutamine for hypotension. He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on 5 of dobutamine with 2PIV.
.
On arrival to CCU, blood pressure was 71/40, HR 140s regular
narrow complex tachycardia, respiratory rate of 20 with O2 sat
mid 90s on room air. EKG showed narrow complex tachycardia with
rate of 148 with long R-P interval.  He was given adesonine 6mg
and then 12mg without significant change in rate (130s) or
rhythm.  Bedside TTE showed hyperdynamic LV and dilated RV with
adequate wall motion and moderate/severe TR. He was then given 2
mg versed and underwent DCCV 200J after which he transiently
went into an atrial ectopic rhythm with rate in 80s and then
atrial fibrillation with rates in 80s-90s. His blood pressure
improved to 88/50 and then later to 90s/50s.

On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Past Medical History:
1. Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy attributed to Velcade and Rituxin
(with improved LVEF following discontinuation)
2. Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia s/p Velcade and Rituxan (last
Rx in [**8-/2103**])
3. Metastatic prostate cancer - Lupron every 3 months
4. ESRD due to Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia - HD Tues, Thurs
and Sat
5. Hypertension
6. Hypercholesterolemia
7. s/p RV perforation and surgery with complication from RV
biopsy to rule out amyloidosis


Social History:
Retired photographer who lives with his wife, [**Name (NI) 1494**] [**Name (NI) 76298**]
(she is also is HCP). Quit smoking since [**2056**]. Denies current
alcohol use; none since [**2101**].


Family History:
Father died of throat cancer at age 58 (prior smoker) and mother
died in her 90's - ? brain tumor.

IMAGING STUDIES:
[**2106-11-27**] 2D-ECHO - There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with normal free wall contractility. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
Severe [4+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. Normal LV function. Dilated and hypertrophied RV with
pressure and volume overload. Severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Compared with the findings of
the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-5-9**], there are now
signs of worsening RV pressure and volume overload.

fracture. Intact sternal
