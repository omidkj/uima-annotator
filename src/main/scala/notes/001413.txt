Brief Hospital Course:
81 yo M with history of CAD, CVA, admitted with NSTEMI, SBO, and
lethargy.
.
# NSTEMI/CAD.  The patient was found to have elevaated troponins
prior to transfer. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] CD 419, MB index 7,
Troponin 0.36. ECG with LBBB, but did get documentation that
this is old (past ECG in chart). Cardiology was consulted while
patient was in the MICU and recommended to continue medical
management of CAD with ASA, plavix, ace-inhibitor, high dose
statin, b-blocker and also continuing heparing gtt for 48 hours.
They felt the elevated troponin leak was less likely to be from
ACS and more likely from demand. Heparin drip was stopped after
48 hours and he continued to be chest pain free on medical
management. TTE demonstrated an EF of 20%. His tropol XL was
increased to 75mg daily, he was started on lisinopril 10mg
daily, continued on atorvastatin 80mg. His aspirin was increased
to 325mg and plavix 75mg daily was started. The patient should
undergo cardiac rehabilitation upon discharge from [**Hospital1 1501**] as well
as continued physical therapy. During rehabilitation please
watch for symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope,
palpitations. His work effort should be advanced slowly with
monitoring for the development of symptoms. He was restarted on
lasix and is being discharged on lasix 80mg twice daily (prior
home dose 40mg twice daily). His weight should be monitored
daily and consider dose increase with weight increase of 3lb.
Please check his chemistry on [**12-23**] and replete K if needed.
Please also monitor BUN/Cr on increased dose of lasix and
lisinopril.
.
# Abdominal pain/SBO.  Unclear precipitant.  No known surgical
history other than prostatectomy.  No identified transition
point from CT, but does have distal decompressed bowel. Patient
with benign exam and CT only suggestive of SBO without other
process. General surgery followed patient during hospitalization
and recommended no acute surgical intervention along with serial
abdominal exams. Patient's abdominal pain resolved after having
a bowel movement. A NGT was also placed and put on intermittent
low suction. After low residuals were observed, the NG tube was
clamped and later removed. His diet was advanced to low
sodium/cardiac heart healthy. He tolerated solid foods well with
no abdominal pain prior to discharge. The patient was also
having normal bowel movements.
.
# Lethargy.  Baseline per wife as above.  Generally is able to
get up and ambulate; speech deficits and generalized weakness at
baseline.  Also noted by wife to be intermittently lethargic and
falls asleep easily.  Head CT negative for acute process.
.
# Renal failure.  Possible mild acute component on chronic, but
unclear what actual baseline is.  Was 1.7 in [**2101**]. The patient
was given IVF fluids and his Cr improved to 1.2 prior to
discharge.
.
# Acute systolic CHF:   Echo done and shows EF of 20%. Patient
on appropriate CHF medications (see NSTEMI/CAD above). Due to
being fluid overload on exam, his lasix dose was increased once
his kidney function improved. He responded well to diuresis with
no increase in his Cr. His lasix dose has been increased to 80mg
po BID for continued lower extremity edema. Please check chem 7
on [**12-23**]
.
# O2 requirement: Initially required 2-3L NC. This is likely [**1-7**]
CHF. The patient was diuresed as indicated above. He was
discharged on room air.
