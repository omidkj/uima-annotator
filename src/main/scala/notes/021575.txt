Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, wide complex tachycardia at OSH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 42970**] is a 41yo man w/ hx of duchennes MD (w/trach and
chronic respiratory failure requiring ventilation) who presented
to OSH w/dyspnea, diaphoresis and tachycardia. Per pt and pt's
mother, he was in his ususual state of health, doing well when
at 5pm last night ([**2180-8-23**]) he began to feel short of breath,
looked pale per mother and had palpitations. This had not
happended before and they became concerned. Pt denied having
chest pain or abdominal pain, no fevers or chills, no upper
respiratory or cold symptoms and no difficulty breathing up
until this point. There had been no changes in his ususual
medication regimen and he had been taking his meds as prescribed
(his mother and father are very involved in his care and he had
nursing help 5 days a week). Family drove to OSH hospital. Per
OSH records he was initially in sinus rhythem but then developed
a. flutter followed by wide complex tachycardia w/ rates to 270
but then spontatenously decreased to 170. CXR was clear. He
received metoprolol; however his SBP dropped to 80s. He was then
given IV fluids and his SBP initially improved to 100s, but then
dropped back down to 80s. Pt recieved amio 150 x 1, lopressor
5mg IV w/no change in rate, then amio gtt was started. B/c of
unstable vitals, decission was made to cardiovert. At that time
pt found to be in A fib; DC cardioversion x 1 with 50J resulted
in improvement in BP and pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on amio
gtt.
.
On arrival pt was normotensive (98-102/50-54) w/HR in 70s; ST
depressions were seen inferolateral distribution on EKG. CXR
showed elevated right hemidiaphraghm and right atelectasis but
was otherwise clear. Pt reported improvement in symptoms; VS
were stable at 123/85 RR 17 HR 70s. No dyspnea, no chest pain or
discomfort.
.
On review of systems, denies myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. Denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. Denies URI symptoms. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
orthopnea, ankle edema.

Past Medical History:
1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: -Diabetes, -Dyslipidemia, -Hypertension

2. CARDIAC HISTORY:
-Status post cardiac arrest in [**2163**] in setting of viral pna.
-Left ventricular ejection fraction of 37% by cardiac MRI in
[**2173**] at [**Hospital3 1810**].
- From [**2173**]-[**2175**], he experienced infrequent palpitations, which
were thought to be related to isolated premature ventricular
beats. These subsequently subsided and he was been doing well.
He was maintained on lisinopril 2.5 mg daily for a number of
years given his depressed left ventricular ejection fraction.
- Long QT interval.
- Known right bundle branch block.
3. OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
-Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
-Chronic respiratory failure requiring ventilation; s/p trach
'[**70**], vent-dependent.
-Bronchiectasis.
-Scoliosis.
-Cholelithiasis requiring recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] and ERCP.
-Status post open gastrectomy and PEG tube placement.

He lives with his [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 4559**] and Pirina. He has nursing
care 5 days a week. He is a nonsmoker and denies alcohol use.

Family History:

CABG for CAD.

Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2180-8-24**]

Conclusions
LV systolic function appears depressed. However, even with
intravenous echocardiography contrast administration, imaging
was extremely suboptimal. If clinically indicated, a
transesophageal echocardiographic examination or cardiac MR
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 5098**]) is recommended.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Depressed left ventricular
function
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2180-8-24**]
FINDINGS: Single AP upright portable chest radiograph is
obtained. The
patient is rotated to the right somewhat limiting evaluation. A
tracheostomy tube is noted. There is stabilization hardware
along the thoracic spine. The patient has elevated right
hemidiaphragm on the prior exam and this appears stable on
today's study. There is no definite consolidation, possibility
of small effusion on the right cannot be excluded. The heart is
shifted into the right lower chest, though this is also stable.
No large pneumothorax. Bony structures are demineralized.
IMPRESSION: No definite acute findings. Stable elevation of the
right
hemidiaphragm with haziness of the right lung base which is
likely chronic
though a small effusion cannot be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 42970**] is a 41 year old man with a history of duchennes
muscular dystrophy (w/trach and chronic respiratory failure
requiring ventilation) who presented to an outside hospital with
dyspnea, diaphoresis and tachycardia.  At the OSH, he initially
received an amiodarone load, lopressor, and was started on an
amiodarone drip.  His blood pressure was unstable and was found
to have a wide complex tachycardia.  He was DC converted once
with rapid improvement in blood pressure and heart rate and
subsequently was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care and
management.
.
# Ventricular tachycardia: The patient presented with sudden
onset of palpitations with diaphoresis and his tachycardia may
be due to his longstanding history of Duchennes muscular
dystrophy and systolic dysfunction with EF 35%.  He was
continued on an amiodarone drip overnight in our CCU and then
transitioned to PO amiodarone.  His lisinopril was continued and
he was seen by our electrophysiology team.
.
# Tracheostomy/Ventilatory Dependence: His transient dyspnea was
most likely secondary to his VT rather than an acute pulmonary
process.  He was mechanically ventilated with his tracheostomy
and maintained on his home albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers
during his admission.
