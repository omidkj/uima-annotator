Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement. Red blood cell transfusion.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 79 year old male with history of interstitial lung
disease on oral prednisone taper (5-10 mg) at home, 3-4L nasal
cannula oxygen at night at home, diastolic congestive heart
failure, type two diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease
with recent NSTEMI, unresectable cholangiocarcinoma status-post
ex-laparotomy with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy ([**2138-9-16**]) with
positive margins, common bile duct excision, cholecystectomy,
lymph node biopsy and percutaneous drain placement ([**2138-9-16**]) who
was admitted to an outside hospital on [**10-26**] with fever, hypoxia,
confusion thought to be PNA/CHF treated with levofloxacin and
diuresis. He was found to have NSTEMI which was medically
managed. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of possible
abscess in setting of recent surgery, but CT abdomen was
negative for abscess.
.
Patient was transferred from surgery to medicine on [**11-1**] after
he was found to have hypoxia, with oxygen saturation of 70-80s
on NC at transfer. He was given nebs but no diuresis since [**10-31**]
due to increased Cr. He has been followed by pulmonary consult
while in house - unable to get workup for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] for high res
CT. Has been on 5L NC and stable. On morning of transfer, around
4:15am, desat to 40-50s and found to be in respiratory distress
with accessory muscle use and cyanotic. On 6L NC and high flow
mask with O2 sat of 94% but with paO2 of 55 on ABG. 7.48/34/55.
Lactate up to 3.2. CXR showing increased effusion with increased
haziness on right side. Given 20mg IV lasix, 60mg PO prednisone,
nitro SL. EKG unchanged. SBP 120s.
.
Patient's code status still full code - from a cancer
perspective, the patient has been told that his expected life
expectancy in the 5 year range.

Pertinent Results:
High resolution chest CT [**2138-11-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Recent changes over four days documented by conventional
chest radiographs
indicate that at least some of the reticular and ground-glass
abnormalities in
the lungs, which have worsened since [**10-29**] are pulmonary
edema. The
progression of the same abnormalities between [**10-9**] and
[**10-29**] could
be due to some component of interstitial lung disease, which was
clearly
present on the earliest examination.

2. Persistent pulmonary arterial hypertension and global
cardiomegaly. Severe
coronary atherosclerotic calcification. Aortic valvular
calcification of
uncertain significance.

3. Large thyroid cysts or nodules. Ultrasound examination
recommended if not
already obtained.

[**2138-10-31**]
Transthoracic Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is
no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**2-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-8-25**], no
definite change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old male with past medical history of
type two diabetes mellitus, interstitial lung disease, diastolic
congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease status post
NSTEMI with recent diagonsis of unresectable cholangiocarcinoma
status post common bile duct excision, cholecystectomy, lymph
node biopsy, percutaneous drain placement and Roux-en-Y
hepaticojejunostomy, with no further surgical management,
transferred to MICU for hypoxia.
.
Hypoxia - Differential at time of arrival to medical intensive
care unit included exacerbation of his interstitial lung
disease, congestive heart failure, hospital-acquired pneumonia,
and PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] respiratory status was too tenuous to undergo
bronchoscopy for further diagonostic purposes. Given that he had
been on long-standing steroids, and after a high-resolution CT
was obtained as noted above, therapy for hospital acquired
pneumonia with vancomycin and zosyn was initiated. Patient was
begun on steroids and bactrim for treatment of possible PCP as
well. Gentle diuresis was attempted, although it did not appear
as though he was volume overloaded on exam. This was limited by
borderline blood pressures with systolics in the 90's. He was
ruled out for a myocardial infarction, and his symptoms were not
felt to be consistent with acute coronary syndrome.

No improvement was noted with the above therapies, and the
intensive care team was unable to wean Mr. [**Known lastname **] from 100%
oxygen high-flow mask. Given that it appeared most likely that
he had a flare and exacerbation of his pulmonary fibrosis, he
was started on high dose pulse steroids. Culture data was
unrevealing for an infection. He was transfused red blood cells
with subsequent diuresis without improvement in his dyspnea.

During his time in the intensive care unit from [**2138-11-3**]
onward, the patient became progressively more short of breath.
He required both high flow mask of 100% oxygen as well as 10 L
nasal cannula, and was only able to maintain oxygen saturations
in the 80's as of [**2138-11-11**]. The patient, along with his family,
pastor, and friends, made the decision to not pursue intubation
or resuscitation, as the patient understood that it was unlikely
that he would be able to be weaned off of the ventilator should
he be intubated. His focus shifted towards lessening the feeling
of his dyspnea as his respiratory status worsened.

On the morning of [**2138-11-12**], patient expressed that he wished to
stop receiving oxygen therapy and focus solely on comfort
measures. With his family at the bedside, his morphine dri
