Pertinent Results:
[**2166-4-22**] ECHO
PREBYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending, transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
significant atherosclerotic plaque. The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good [**Month/Day/Year **]
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. The
mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity. There is
no pericardial effusion. Mean mitral valve gradient was 13mm Hg
with MVA of 1.2 by PHT. Severe MR is present. Normal LV Function
with LVEF > 55%

POSTBYPASS: Normal functioning mechanical [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] bileaflet
dilting disc valve. No significant MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] motion. No
stenosis (gradient = 3 mmHg). Normal LV systolic function with
LVEF > 55% and no significant wall motion abnormalities.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 90205**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2166-4-22**] for surgical
management of his mitral valve disease.  He was taken to the
operating room where he underwent a mitral valve replacement
using a St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valve. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit
for monitoring. Over the next several hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. He was started on beta
blockade and amiodarone for atrial fibrillation. A heparin drip
was started as a bridge to Coumadin for his mechanical valve
with a goal INR of 2.5-3.5. Heparin was discontinued when his
INR was therapuetic. He was in sinus rhythm on discharge.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
He was evaluated by physical therapy for strength and
conditioning. He was slow to wean from oxygen therapy, but was
stable on room air by discharge.  On postoperative day 6 he was
discharged to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2048**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] House in [**Location (un) 86**].
