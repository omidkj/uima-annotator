History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 61867**] is a 75 yo male with a history of TBI, GI bleed in
[**2111**], CKI, prostate cancer, and recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2114-2-14**] for aspiration pneumonia, who was noted at his rehab on
the morning of [**2114-3-6**] to be SOB with an oxygen sat of 94% on RA.
Per OSH records, the patient stated that he had felt SOB for two
days, but denied cough, CP, N/V/D/C, leg pain or LE swelling. A
CXR at the rehab on [**2114-3-6**] was normal however the patient
developed an oxygen requirement, satting 93-95% on 2L NC.
Despite treatment with q4H duonebs, he continued to experience
SOB, difficulty breathing, and agitation. He was brought by EMS
to NWH on [**2114-3-7**] where he was found to be A=Ox3,with vitals: T:
98, BP: 139/60, P: 75, RR: 32, and POx of 88% on RA. EKG showed
no change from previous. Labs were notable for a elevated
d-dimer of 3.4 and Cr 1.3. A CTA chest at the OSH showed
multiple PEs. Although he remained HD stable, he began to have
increasing work of breathing and was subsequently intubated. He
was given 70 mg of Lovenox,500cc bolus of NS, and duonebs at
OSH. At the time of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] vitals were: BP 159/85 RR
17 100% AC 550x16 Fi02 100.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: afebrile, P: 82, BP: 139/48, RR: 17,
O2 sat 99% vented. The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
further management. EKG showed LBBB but NSR.
.
On the floor, the patient was sedated and intubated. Vitals
were: T: 101F, P: 69, RR: 18, BP: 122/52, with oxygen sat of 99%
on FiO2 100, VT 550, f 16, PEEP 5.
.
Review of sytems: unable to obtain.

Pertinent Results:
[**2114-3-7**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. ET tube approximately 2.4 cm above the carina.
2. Mild fluid overload.
3. Basilar atelectasis. However, developing infection cannot be
excluded.

[**2114-3-7**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-9**], there is
now an endotracheal tube in place with its tip approximately 2.8
cm above the carina. Nasogastric tube extends into the distal
stomach. There is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
bilateral pleural effusions and extension of fluid into the
minor fissure on the right. Retrocardiac opacification is
consistent with volume loss or, in the appropriate setting,
consolidation in the left lower lobe.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old male with a history of TBI, GI bleed in [**2113**], CKI,
prostate cancer, and recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2114-2-14**] for
aspiration pneumonia, now admitted for respiratory distress
associated with multiple pulmonary emboli.

# Multiple pulmonary emboli: Patient with multiple pulmonary
emboli likely secondary to immobility and malignancy. He was
admitted to the ICU having already been intubated at an OSH due
to respiratory failure despite his HCP's wishes that the patient
not be intubated or resuscitated. He remained hemodynamically
stable and was placed on Lovenox for treatment of his pulmonary
emboli, but following discussion with the primary team, the HCP
decided to extubate the patient and to provide only comfort
measures if the patient's respiratory status began to
deteriorate. The patient was extubated and placed on Morphine
for comfort. He passed away early the next day. His HCP gave
consent for an autopsy.

# Fever: Patient with fever thought to be secondary to pulmonary
emboli, but given his history of recent hospitalization for
aspiration PNA, blood, sputum, and urine cultures were sent to
rule out an infectious etiology. Active surveillance for
infection was stopped after discussion with the patient's
caregiver.

# Chronic Renal Insufficiency: Not an active issue. Patient's
creatinine on admission was noted to be 1.4 which was at
patient's [**Date Range 5348**] of 1.3-1.7.
