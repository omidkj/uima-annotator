elevated WBC who is admitted to the ICU for hypotension and
fever. He was well until he woke up this morning with rigors and
feeling of lightheadedness without syncope. He took a hot shower
that did not warm him up and decided to present to the ED given
that these symptoms were similar to his prior Strep viridans
septic shock. He denies any other localizing symptoms including
cough, rhinorrhea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgias, chest
pain/pressure, SOB, calf pain, or rash. He recently travelled to

a temperature up to 103F. Vanco and zosyn were given in the ED.
Initial lactate was 2.2, elevated to 2.5 after 2nd liter of NS.
WBC was 21.3 with 88% neutrophils. CXR showed L retrocardiac

Brief Hospital Course:
57 year old asplenic male with HIV (per pt. most recent
CD4=600), h/o strep viridans sepsis in [**Month (only) 547**]/[**2148-6-14**], was
admitted with sepsis, most likely secondary to left leg
cellulitis.

1. Sepsis
Patient presented with fevers, tachycardia, elevated WBC, and
hypotension responsive to fluids.  Of note, the patient is
asplenic, so encapsulated organisms were of concern.  There was
concern for another episode of Strep Viridans sepsis as with his
previous hospitalization in [**2148-6-14**], but his blood cultures
have been negative so far. Initial interpretation of CXR was
possible PNA, but the patient did not have any respiratory
symptoms to support it.  A left lower extremity cellulitis was
the likely source of sepsis.  The cellulitis had no induration,
but the erythema and swelling appeared to increase slowly in
size for a full 24 hours on the intravenous antibiotic regimen
before it stabilized.

Vancomycin and Zosyn were continued for treatment of his
cellulitis because of his history of MRSA and to cover for
encapsulated organisms.  GC/Chlamydia swaps were negative.  ID
consult recommended transition to PO Bactrim and Augmentin as
outpatient therapy.  Will defer to PCP as to whether or not
patient should have penicillin prophylaxis because of his
asplenia.

2. Acute vs Chronic Renal Insufficiency:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12651**] creatinine was 1.3-1.4 on presentation. His
baseline creatinine is unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] had acute renal failure
during his last hospitalization in [**Month (only) 116**], and it is unclear
whether his creatinine ever returned to his baseline.

3. HIV
Per patient, his last CD4 count was greater than 600, and his
viral load undetectable. During his hospitalization, he was
continued on Atripla.

4. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
He was initially maintained on insulin sliding scale but was
then transitioned to his home regimen of metformin.

5. Hypertension
His lisinopril was initially held during this admission and then
restarted once his blood pressure improved.
