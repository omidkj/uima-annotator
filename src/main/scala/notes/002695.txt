Chief Complaint:
Left sided chest pain/back pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2142-7-23**]
1.  Replacement of ascending aorta and hemiarch with a 32-mm
    Dacron Vascutek Gelweave graft using deep hypothermic

History of Present Illness:
62 year old gentleman with a history of a type B aortic
dissection in [**2141-6-9**] and ascending aortic aneurysm discovered
at that time which has been managed medically with blood
pressure control. Given the significance of his aneurysm along
with possiblity of a connective tissue disorder, it was planned
to proceed with surgery. He underwent a cardiac catheterization
which revealed left anterior descending artery disease

TTE [**2142-7-23**]:
Pre-bypass: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is markedly dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The abdominal aorta is moderately dilated. A mobile
density is seen in the descending aorta consistent with an
intimal flap/aortic dissection. The aortic wall is thickened
consistent with an intramural hematoma. There is flow in the
false lumen. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-bypass: There is a well-seated aortic graft above the level
of the aortic annulus that measures 32 mm in diameter.
Biventricular systolic function is unchanged. The aortic contour
is unchanged post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2142-7-23**] where he underwent replacement of
ascending aorta and hemiarch with a 32-mm Dacron Vascutek
Gelweave graft using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and
coronary artery bypass grafting x1 with left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending coronary artery.  See
operative note for full details. Overall the patient tolerated
the procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the
CVICU in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and some
breathing difficulty requiring BIPAP. The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic
or vasopressor support.  He was started on Vancomycin and
Cefepime for a presumed left sided pneumonia for a 10 day
course. Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently
diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  He was in and out of
rate controlled atrial fibrillation throughout his hospital
course and started on Amiodarone and Coumadin with an INR goal
2-2.5.  He will be followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and the [**Hospital 756**]
[**Hospital3 **] for his Coumadin dosing.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery on post
operative day 5. On post operative day 6 the patient was
swallowing a medication, started choking and had a vagal episode
losing consciousness for a few seconds.  The patient was
hemodynamically stable after the episode with no events on the
monitor throughout the episode. He was transferred to the CVICU
for further monitoring.  He remained hemodynamically stable and
was transferred back to the telemetry floor in stable condition.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.  The patient
was ambulating with oxygenation desaturation.  Reassessment of
his pulmonary status proved further pulmonary rehabilitation was
required prior to discharge home. The wound was healing and pain
was controlled with oral analgesics.  He was transfused 2units
of PRBC for a hematocrit of 25.6% on [**2142-8-2**].  Hematocrit rose
appropriately.  The patient was discharged to rehab in good
condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
