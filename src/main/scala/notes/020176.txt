Left Total Knee Replacement


History of Present Illness:
57-year-old male with a past medical history significant for
severe bilateral arthritis S/P R TKR in [**10-8**]; CAD S/P MI
(remote); recurrent DVT and PE and atrial fibrillation, on
Coumadin; hypertension; CHF, diastolic and systolic; obstructive
sleep apnea, on BiPAP; severe COPD on 4L home O2; history of
heavy tobacco abuse; systemic lupus now in remission; diabetes;
hepatitis C; colon cancer (resected); and peripheral neuropathy.
 He is being admitted for an elective left total knee
replacement, but given his complex medical problems, it was felt
he should be admitted to medicine pre-operatively.  When he had
his right TKR in [**10-8**] he was transferred to medicine post-op for
management of fluid overload and anticoagulation.  He had a COPD
exacerbation [**1-16**] that was treated with Abx.  His current
surgery was supposed to be done [**1-26**], but when admitted pre-op
was found to have PNA, treated with ceftriaxone and cefpodoxime.
 Surgery was rescheduled to [**2-12**].

On review of systems here he denies cough, fever, chills,
vomiting, constipation, orthopnea, increased dyspnea on exertion
or dysuria.  He does use 4L home O2, but has no change in his
requirements.  He has chronic knee pain and neuropathy for which
he takes methadone every 6 hours.

Urine Cultures ([**2-12**], [**2-13**], [**2-14**]): No Growth

Imaging:
Pre-Op ECG ([**2201-2-11**]):
Atrial fibrillation with single wide complex beat, possibly
ventricular.
ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the previous tracing of [**2200-11-8**]
the wide
complex beat is new.

Pre-Op CXR ([**2201-2-11**]):
FINDINGS: Comparison made to [**2201-2-4**]. Moderate cardiac
enlargement
is unchanged, without evidence of increased pulmonary
vascularity, or
pulmonary edema. Lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion
or
pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged cardiomegaly.

Final Report
LEFT KNEE [**2201-2-12**]
CLINICAL INFORMATION: Total knee replacement.
FINDINGS:
Three views of the left knee are compared to the prior study
from [**2200-12-23**].
These demonstrate interval placement of total left knee
arthroplasty in near
anatomic alignment without hardware complication at this time.
Surgical
staples are present. There are post-surgical changes in the soft
tissues.
Small joint effusion is present.

[**2201-2-13**]: Lower extrem u/s: negative for DVT (prelim report)
.
CXR ([**2201-2-13**]):
There is interval improvement of pulmonary edema with still
present right
perihilar opacity as well as minimal left perihilar opacity,
most likely
representing residue of the infection. Attention on the
subsequent study is recommended to exclude the possibility of
developing infection. Cardiomegaly is unchanged. Mediastinal
silhouette is stable. No appreciable pleural effusion is
present, although note is made that the left
