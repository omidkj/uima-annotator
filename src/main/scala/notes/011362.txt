Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
tachycardic post op

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar decompressive laminectomy/discectomy L3-4 [**2133-5-4**]
cardiac cath [**2133-5-11**]

History of Present Illness:
79 y/o Russian-speaking M w/ DM, CRI, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
lumbar stenosis s/p elective L3-S1 laminectomy and left L3-4
discectomy on [**5-4**]. The patient was agitated and tachycardic in
PACU, there were ST depressions noted on telemetry monitor. A 12
lead EKG was performed and showed SR 102 2 mm STE aVR ST
depressions in the lateral precordial leads. Initial CK 282 MB 6
Trop 0.01 [**5-4**] @ 1100. CK 4918 MB 74 MBI 1.5 Trop 1.05 [**5-4**] @
[**2123**]. CK 4695 MB 59 MBI 1.3 Trop-T 1.02 [**5-5**] @ 0400 and CK 2716,
CK0MB 21 and MB 0.8 @ 0600. Given the patient's neurosurgical
procedure no anticoagulation with heparin or plavix per
neurosurgery. He was only started on 325mg ASA. His metoprolol
was also titrated up to control his tachycardia.
.
The patient was seen by PT today and while walking became
fatigued and hypotensive to the 80's. He was given IVF bolus,
but BP remained in the 70's. A repeat ECG did not show
significant change from prior. He continues to have ST
depressions. The patient underwent an ECHO that showed focal
basal inferior hypokinesis more apparent and the severity of
mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation has increased
from ECHO [**2133-5-5**]. The patient was then transferred to the CCU.
.
Currently, the patient states he feels well. His family was in
the room. Pt states that his blood pressures normally run low
SBP 90's. He denied fevers, but felt cold and had chills. No
CP/SOB/abdominal pain/ bowel or bladder complaints. He does have
some discomfort in his lower back at his surgery site.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2133-5-11**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA has no
obstructive
disease.  The LAD had serial 90% stenoses at the proximal and
mid
vessel.  The LCX had a 90% ostial stenosis and a 95% stenosis at
the mid
segment.  The RCA had a total occlusion at the mid segment.  The
distal
RCA was filled by right to right collaterals as well as left to
right
collaterals.
2. Limited resting demondyamics demonstrated diastolic
dysfunction with
an elevated LVEDP of 18 mm Hg, as well as normal central
arterial
pressure with central aortic pressure 111/52 mm Hg.

[**2133-5-12**] Carotid Ultrasound
1. Mild homogeneous plaque in both internal carotid arteries.
2. Less than 40% stenoses in the internal carotid arteries
bilaterally

[**2133-5-14**] ECHO
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of septal wall . Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
to moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 39900**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2133-5-4**] for surgical
management of his lumbar stenosis. He was taken to the operating
room where he underwent a redo laminectomy. On postoperative day
four, he was noted to have a myocardial infraction with
hemodynamic compromise. He required resuscitation and intubation
with transfer to the cardiac care unit for further care. Aspirin
was started however heparin and plavix were avoided given his
recent back surgery. Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 39901**] otherwise stabilized from a
cardiac standpoint. He self extubated himself on [**2133-5-8**] however
his oxygen saturations and blood gases remained stable. No
reitubation was required. An echo showed inferior and posterior
[**Last Name (un) **] contractile dysfunction. Pulmonary edema was noted on chest
x-ray and diuresis was initiated. He had two episodes of apnea
and loss of consciousness which resolved spontaneously on
[**2133-5-9**]. Work-up including a head CT was negative. Orthostasis
was assumed. Heparin was ultimately started for anticoagulation.
A speech and swallow evaulation was performed which showed no
significant dysphagia or aspiration. On [**2133-5-11**], Mr. [**Known lastname 39900**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8783**]t a cardiac catheterization which revealed severe three
vessel disease. Given the severity of his disease, the cardiac
surgical was consulted for surgical revascularization. He was
worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid
ultrasound which showed less than 40% stenoses in the internal
carotid arteries bilaterally. On [**2133-5-14**], Mr. [**Known lastname 39900**] was
taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting to five vessels. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit
for monitoring. He was transfused with packed red blood cells
for postoperative anemia. Epinephrine was started for a low
cardiac index. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact
and was extubated. On postoperative day two, he was transferred
to the step down unit for further recovery. He was gently
diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The physical therapy
service was consulted for assistance with his postoperative
strength and mobility. His blood glucose was quite elevated and
difficult to control with intravenous insulin. The [**Last Name (un) 387**]
diabetes service was consulted for assistance in his care. He
developed oliguria, dyspnea and hypotension on [**2133-5-18**] and was
transferred back to the intensive care unit for observation.
Flagyl was started for leukocytosis and loose stools.
