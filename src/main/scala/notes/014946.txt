COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated an
LMCA with an 80% distal lesion. The LAD was occluded after S1;
the
distal LAD filled via LIMA graft without significant disease
apart from
a very distal 70% stenosis; the diagonal filled via an SVG. The
LCX had
an occluded OM with an occluded SVG; the distal OM filled via
collaterals from the diagonal graft. The RCA had a proximal
chronic
occlusion.
2. The LIMA to LAD was patent. The SVG to diagonal was patent.
The SVG
to OM was occluded at its origin. The SVG to RPDA had a proximal

occlusion which appeared acute.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial
pressures.
4. Successful PCI/stent to SVG to PDA (mid body and distal) with
a
3.5x15mm Vision stent and a 3.0x12mm Vision stent. Excellent
result with
no residual stenosis and normal flow. Patient left cathlab
painfree.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Successful PCI/stent to SVG to PDA with 2 bare metal stents.
.
ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
0-5mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There
is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with near
akinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral
walls. The
remaining left ventricular segments contract normally. Right
ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild
to moderate ([**11-21**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation likely due to papillary
muscle dysfunction.
Mild aortic regurgitation.
.
.
CXR: IMPRESSION: Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and
distention of central veins consistent with right heart failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was trasnfered to [**Hospital1 18**] after a V-FIB arrest at
outside hospital associated with increased cardiac enzymes. A
cath was performed with thrombectomy and stent placement in the
graft that supplied his infarct-territory. Interestingly, the
cath showed collateral vessels. He did well post-procedure. His
diuretics were adjusted in house secondary to some episodes of
hypotension.
.
It was unclear if the [**Name (NI) 10507**] arrest was in fact due to ischemia.
As a result, he was scheduled to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of EP for
consideration of a possible EP study. He was fitted for a holter
monitor on discharge.
.
He was seen by physical therapy who recommneded home with
continued services. He was dischaged with follow up.

You were admitted with cardiac arrest secondary to ventricular
fibrillation - the most serious electrical heart abnormality.
You also had a heart attack and we performed a cardiac cath to
open up one of your heart vessels.  We made some adjustments to
your medications.
