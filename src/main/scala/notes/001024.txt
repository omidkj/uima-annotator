ECG: SR LVH by voltage, TWI II, III, flat in aVF, V4-V6; no
significant change from [**2190-11-28**].

Imaging:
CXR: AP supine, compared to [**2190-11-28**]. LLL opacity, concerning
for infection. Reticulonodular pattern relatively unchanged from
[**Name (NI) **]. Slightly enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette,
unchanged from [**Month (only) **].


Brief Hospital Course:
Assesment: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 47F with AIDS, HCV, cardiomyopathy,
and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome who presents with ~6
weeks of fatigue and dyspnea, now worse in the last 3-4 days,
with productive cough
.
Plan:
# Pneumonia: SIRS criteria of hypotension (note that
outpt/ambulatory [**Known lastname **] pressures have been 100-110s), T95.3 on
arrival, RR 36; plus symptoms of resp infection and infiltrate
on CXR. She was covered initially for CAP with CTX and azithro.
She was ruled out for TB by 3 negative AFBs. DFA was negative
for [**Known lastname **]. Bronch was considered but as she improved on this
treatment, it was not done. She was followed by ID who
recommended changing CTX to cefpodoxime on discharge to complete
a 10-day course and to complete a 5-day course of azithro.

# HIV: not on HAART [**2-7**] poor compliance. Has been taking
atovaquone sporadically (reports taking for 2 of last 6 weeks);
this was restarted in-house. Social work was consulted to help
identify barriers to outpatient followup and compliance, and she
was set up with a food program.

# antiphospholipid syndrome: Her INR was supratherapeutic on
admission, so coumadin was held. The importance of compliacne
with INR monitoring was emphasized to her, and she was
discharged on coumadin 5 mg to be restarted on [**2-1**] with close
ouptaient monitoring.  Of note, closer monitoring of the INR in
a patient with APA syndrome is required.

# cardiomyopathy: held ACE-I, BB, digoxin [**2-7**] hypotension,
infection.

# ARF: likely prerenal in setting of febrile illness. This
improved with volume resuscitation.

# oral thrush: continued fluconazole 100mg po daily

# Depression/anxiety: continued ativan
.
# Social: asked SW to see re: poor social supports, difficulty
with outpt med compliance. As she reported she had difficulty
getting food at home, she was set up with a food program.

Discharge Disposition:
Home With Service

Facility:
[**Location (un) 86**] VNA

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary: pneumonia
Secondary: HIV, anxiety, cardiomyopathy, hypertension

Discharge Condition:
good, stable, ambulating independently, not requiring oxygen

Discharge Instructions:
You were evaluated for shortness of breath and cough and found
to have a pneumonia. This is improving with antibiotics.

It is VERY important for you to follow up with your outpatient
providers to be sure you are improving. Several of your
medications were stopped during the admission, and you must
follow up with your doctors to know when to restart them. Do not
take your digoxin, metoprolol, or lisinopril for now as your
[**Location (un) **] pressure is low-normal. Finish your antibiotics as
prescribed.

It is VERY important to have
