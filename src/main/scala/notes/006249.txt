CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2138-10-17**] 8:06 AM
PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST AT 8:10 A.M.: There has been
no interval change since the prior radiograph of [**10-16**].
The lungs are well expanded without consolidation or pleural
effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. The
pulmonary vasculature is normal and unchanged.
IMPRESSION: No short interval change.

Brief Hospital Course:
69F h/o multiple COPD exacerbations admitted for SOB [**3-14**] COPD
exacerbation and contributing CHF.
.
# SOB: Pt had extensive h/o steroid-dependent COPD, with home 2L
O2, and documented reduced PFTs ([**8-/2133**]: FEV1/FVC: 62%).
Although pt reported no specific URI symptoms, pt's elevated
WBC, diarrhea possibly [**3-14**] viral gastroenteritis, increased DOE,
and chest tightness, pt responded in the MICU to steroids and
nebulizers, thereby implicating a likely COPD exacerbation [**3-14**]
URI.  Both in the MICU and after transfer to the floor, pt was
continued on standing nebulizers, nebulizers PRN, prednisone
taper x5d (120mg-->60mg-->40mg x2d-->20mg x2d).  Given that pt's
SOB also improved with a significant UOP to furosemide, CHF may
have also factored into pt's DOE.  Pt was therefore administered
furosemide IV, titrated to achieve goal 500cc UOP, which was
later converted to her home regimen of furosemide 40mg PO.
Additionally, pt was continued on levofloxacin 250 mg daily x7
days given concern for secondary bacterial pulmonary infection
in the setting of COPD exacerbation with leukocytosis.  Blood
cultures sent from the ED were negative.  On discharge, pt's
peak flow had improved to 210, she had completed her antibiotics
course, and pt was discharged on her home dose of prednisone
20mg daily and furosemide 40mg daily.  Pt was also given a
prescription to check her potassium level on [**10-30**], the day of
her follow-up appointment with her PCP.
.
# BLE edema: Pt's presenting BLE edema likely was [**3-14**] CHF
exacerbation, which also contributed to her SOB.  Pt reported
that she had no increased sodium intake or missed furosemide
doses, and proBNP=420 (slightly elevated), but she responded
well to furosemide diuresis with improvement of her BLE edema.
Pt was continued on goal 500cc UOP.  On discharge, pt was
returned to her home dose of furosemide 40mg daily.
.
# CKD:  Pt's recent baseline Cr=1.6, likely [**3-14**] HTN and DM2.
Medications were renally dosed, and Cr was trended.  Pt
maintained her baseline Cr.
.
# DM2:  Pt was continued on 15 units of insulin 70/30 QAM and 10
units of insulin 70/30 QPM with HISS, and followed with FS QID.
Likely [**3-14**] increased steroid dosages, pt's fingerstick glucoses
were elevated into the low 300s, and therefore her insulin 70/30
was increased to 20 units QAM.  On discharge, as pt was returned
back to her home dose of prednisone, pt was returned to her home
dose of insulin 70/30 15 units QAM and 10 units QPM, with
instructions to call her PCP's office over the weekend if
FS>=300.  Pt was provided a prescription for humalog insulin
sliding scale with instructions to apply only for FS>=300.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Pt was continued on atorvastatin 20mg daily
and aspirin 81 mg PO daily.
.
# HTN: Pt was continued on amlodipine 5 mg PO daily and
diltiazem HCl 120 mg SR PO BID.
.
# Seizures: Pt was continued on oxcarbazepine 300 mg PO BID.
.
# Esophagitis, GERD: Pt was administered a PPI and continued on
home regimen of sucralfate 1 g PO QID and nystatin solution.
.
# Depression: Pt was continued on desipramine 20 mg daily.
