Admission Date:  [**2158-2-2**]     Discharge Date:  [**2158-2-12**]

Date of Birth:   [**2079-3-12**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Patient admited [**2-2**] for elective BiV
pacer placement.  Transferred to the CCU on [**2-3**] secondary
to increased pericardial effusion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old female
with non-insulin dependent-diabetes and COPD, whose cardiac
history is significant for coronary artery disease status
post MI in [**2133**], PTCA, RCA stent in [**2152**], hypertension,
dyslipidemia, CHF with an ejection fraction of 25% on a
transthoracic echocardiogram done [**2158-2-3**], who was evaluated
for BiV placement secondary to decreased exercise tolerance
and shortness of breath over the last several years.  Patient
received her BiV ICD implant on [**2158-2-2**].  Vital signs were
hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure.

Patient complained of left sided chest pain and had ongoing
nausea on [**2158-2-3**] that prompted a transthoracic
echocardiogram, which revealed a small pericardial effusion
with thrombus formation over the right ventricle without
evidence of tamponade.  However, she began to experience
increasing nausea and heaviness in the chest, and a repeat
transthoracic echocardiogram revealed slightly increased
effusion size of approximately 1.5 cm.  During the course of
the hospitalization, patient had remained hemodynamically
stable with blood pressures 118-156/55-70, sats 96-98% on [**3-2**]
liters of O2.

On admission she was not experiencing any new symptoms or
complaints of shortness of breath or chest pain.

ALLERGIES:  Lisinopril.

PREVIOUS MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. CAD with a MI in [**2133**].
2. Diabetes.
3. COPD not on home O2, however, this was recommended one
year prior to this admission.
4. CHF with an EF of 25%.
5. Hypertension.
6. AS with a valve area of 1.3 cm in [**8-31**].
7. Dyslipidemia.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient has multiple children and
grandchildren, one of whom is a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 18**].

SURGICAL HISTORY:  Status post cholecystectomy in [**2153**].

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature 97.9, blood pressure
118-156/40-66, pulse 61-101.  Patient is [**Age over 90 **]% on 2 liters of
O2.  Blood glucoses ranging 148-225.  Respiratory rate 18-22.
Pulsus paradoxus at 14.  In general, patient is in no acute
distress, speaking in full sentences.  Pulmonary exam:  Clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular exam:  S1, S2
regular, 2/6 systolic murmur right upper sternal border.  No
JVD is noted.  Abdominal exam:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities:  No edema.  Neurological exam is
nonfocal.

Transthoracic echocardiogram shows an echo-dense effusion.
There is no evidence of tamponade.

LABORATORIES:  White count 8.4, hematocrit 34.5, platelets
149.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 78-year-old woman with
noninsulin-dependent diabetes with history of CAD, CHF with
an ejection fraction of 25%.  He is status post BiV ICD
placement on [**2-2**].  Developed an increasing pericardial
effusion, but remained hemodynamically stable.

1. Cardiovascularly:  Patient was admitted to the CCU on
[**2-3**] for monitoring of her pericardial effusion.  All
aspirin, anticoagulants such as Coumadin were held.  Patient
had a frequent monitoring of her pulsus paradoxus, which
ranged from [**12-12**], but did not increase.  Patient had
repeated multiple follow-up echocardiograms, which
demonstrated resolution of her small pericardial effusion.

Patient did complain of increased pain at the site of her
pacemaker implantation.  She was given Morphine for this
pain, which caused increasing nausea.  Morphine was changed
to tramadol secondary to multiple days of nausea and
vomiting.  This resolved moderately.  Was changed to NSAIDs,
although did not completely resolve.  Patient was
hemodynamically stable, and was transferred to the floor.

Rhythm:  Patient was V-paced with multiple PVCs.  On [**2-4**],
she was noted to have rapid rates alarming for V-tach.
Patient was started on her beta blocker and monitored.

On [**2158-2-5**], patient was again alarmed for a rapid rate.  On
[**2-6**], patient's pacer was evaluated and interrogated by the
EP service, who found that she was in paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation.  Patient was started [**2-6**] on an amiodarone
dose of 400, then changed to 200 t.i.d.  Patient was
cardioverted [**2-7**] without any complications.  Thyroid
function and liver function was assessed.

Patient had pulmonary function tests one year prior to
admission on [**2157-2-2**] that can serve as a pre-amiodarone
baseline.  TSH was 1.3 this admission, AST 17, ALT 10.
Patient remained A-paced to avoid returning into a PAF and
remained stable with a regular rate throughout the remainder
of hospital course.  Patient was discharged home with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
of Hearts monitor to be followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Amiodarone was discontinued two days prior to discharge.
This will be discussed under nausea and vomiting.

Pump:  Patient had an EF notable for 25%.  She was continued
on her home medications.  Digoxin was started and carvedilol.

Endocrine:  Patient has diabetes.  She was maintained on
regular insulin-sliding scale, metformin.

Pulmonary:  Patient was noted to have decreased sats on room
air ranging 78-85%.  It was noted from patient's previous
admission one year prior that she had similar sats on room
air as well as a full set of pulmonary function tests.
Patient had been sent home on home O2.  However, patient
states she never felt the need for home O2, and did not wear
it often.  It was explained to patient this will be
encouraged in the future for further use.

Hematology:  Patient was transfused 1 unit of packed red
blood cells for hematocrit of 27.  On [**2-5**], she is noted to
have a fairly large hematoma over her ICD placement.  Patient
had OB negative stool throughout the course of this hospital
stay.  Hematoma gradually resolved.

Nausea and vomiting:  Patient initially experienced nausea
and vomiting on [**2-3**] leading to the transthoracic
echocardiogram that demonstrated her pericardial effusion.
Her nausea and vomiting persisted throughout her hospital
course, although is somewhat improved off of narcotics.
Patient developed diarrhea one day after her amiodarone load.
Cultures and Clostridium difficile were sent.  Clostridium
difficile was negative.  Cultures are pending upon patient's
discharge.

Patient continued to have nocturnal vomiting [**2-7**] through
[**2-10**].  Patient was sent for a head CT to rule out a mass
that would lead to nocturnal vomiting.  Head CT was negative.
Patient was to be discharged on [**2-10**], however, this was
delayed secondary to extensive diarrhea and continued
vomiting.  Amiodarone was discontinued at this time.  Patient
was started on Imodium.  Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
slowly resolved, and patient was able to be discharged home
hemodynamically stable, tolerating p.o. on [**2-12**].

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Diabetes.
2. Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
in [**2133**] and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, right
coronary artery stent in [**2152**].
3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4. Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%.
5. Hypertension.
6. Stable pericardial effusion.
7. Status post BiV ICD placement.
8. Atrial fibrillation status post cardioversion.
