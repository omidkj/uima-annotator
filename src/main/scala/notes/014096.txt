Admission Date:  [**2142-7-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2142-8-28**]

Date of Birth:   [**2092-4-25**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Neurosurgery

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50-year-old
right-handed gentleman who was found confused at home after
not showing up for work.

He was found on [**2142-7-14**] at home by a co-worker.
Reportedly at home, he was agitated and confused but awake
and responsive.  Reportedly, he then became less responsive
and was brought to the Emergency Department at an outside
hospital.  A computed tomography scan there showed a
subarachnoid hemorrhage.  He was noted to decompensate.  He
was then intubated.

On [**7-15**], he was transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] where he was found to have an anterior
communicating artery aneurysm.  The aneurysm was coiled on
[**7-15**].  He also received a ventricular drain for
prominent hydrocephalus in the Emergency Department.

In the Emergency Department, he was noted to have a variable
level of consciousness with a fluctuating mental status
examination.  At times, he would follow commands, while at
others he would be more somnolent.

Subsequent to his coiling, he was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit for close neurologic monitoring.  There,
he developed atrial fibrillation requiring amiodarone.
Subsequently, he became febrile and the ventricular drain was
removed.  He received a spinal tap showing 2400 [**Known lastname **] blood
cells and 50 red blood cells.  He was then placed on
vancomycin and ceftazidime for macrobacterial coverage.
Subsequent cultures were negative.

By [**2142-8-5**], he was more responsive.  During his
stay in the Intensive Care Unit he slowly became more awake
and alert.  He began moving all four extremities and
following commands more regularly.

On [**8-7**], he had his first lumbar puncture for
hydrocephalus.  The opening pressure was 23.  Approximately
35 cc of cerebrospinal fluid was removed leaving a closing
pressure of 8 cm of water.

Subsequently, he also received a video swallow which he
passed.  The nasogastric tube was then removed, and he was
started on a by mouth diet.

He received several subsequent lumbar punctures to relieve
increasing cerebrospinal fluid.  Neurologically, he remained
intact even with elevated opening pressures.  The notion of
inserting a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was debated, but given
his improving neurologic function, it was ultimately
cancelled.

On [**8-21**], there was an incident report where he became
agitated and hit a nurse in the nose.  He was placed on
four-point restraints and then transferred to a vale bed for
a short duration.  He subsequently calmed down and has been
compliant since.  He has not needed a vale bed for the last
several days.

On Mini-Mental State testing, he scored a 15.  He was
subsequently seen by the Neurobehavioral team for a
consultation and was placed on Haldol and Ativan as needed.

ALLERGIES:

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   His subsequent stay on
the [**Hospital1 **] has been uneventful, and he has gradually improved.
He currently ambulates well independently with supervision.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  On examination, he was
afebrile.  His blood pressure was 148/80, heart rate was 78,
and his respiratory rate was 14.  He was alert, cooperative,
and polite.  He was oriented to hospital but not to time.  He
had fluent speech wit normal comprehension, but some
difficulty recalling the names of people.  He was able to
read and write a sentence.  Able to perform months backward
to [**Month (only) **], then [**Month (only) **], [**Month (only) 359**].  He had full visual fields
without extinction, full extraocular movements, facial
symmetry, and normal tongue protrusion in the midline.  His
motor examination was normal throughout.  He displayed no
drift, asterixis, or tremor.  His reflexes were brisk and
symmetric throughout.  He had normal sensation to light touch
and pinprick throughout.  His cardiovascular examination was
normal.  He had clear lung fields.  His abdomen was soft and
nontender.  He had good distal pulses with no peripheral
edema.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (His discharge medications
included)
 1.  Insulin sliding-scale.
 2.  Subcutaneous heparin.
