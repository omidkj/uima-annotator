History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 25501**] is a 81 year-old male with COPD.  He presented to [**Hospital 25502**] Hospital, [**Location (un) 8117**] NH on [**2132-2-11**] for increased shortness of
breath. A chest film revealed a right pneumothorax, a chest tube
was placed to suction, on [**2133-2-11**] pleurodesis with 1 gm Doxy was
done, resolution of pneumothorax by chest film, RLL infiltrates
were also seen, sputum culture grew pseudomonas treated with

CXR:
[**2133-2-27**]: There is a minimal right basal air collection in the
pleural
space. No clear apical pneumothorax is identified. Unchanged
opacities at
the left lung base and the entire right lung, but both lungs
show signs of
improved aeration. No newly occurred parenchymal opacities.
Normal size of
the cardiac silhouette.
[**2133-2-26**]: Unchanged appearance of parenchymal opacity at the
bases of the right upper lobe and the atelectasis at both lung
bases. Minimal right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
Unchanged size of the cardiac
silhouette. No interval appearance of new parenchymal opacities.

[**2133-2-25**]: 1. Very small right-sided hydropneumothorax with chest
tube in unchanged position.
2. Heterogeneous opacification of the right lung with focal
opacity in the right upper lobe. It is difficult to entirely
exclude pneumonia but the
appearance could be seen with post-operative changes including
atelectasis.
3. Severe emphysema.
[**2133-2-19**]: FINDINGS: Very small right apical pneumothorax is
present with a basilar right chest tube in place. Postoperative
changes are present within the right mid lung with surgical
chain sutures. Upper lobe bullous emphysema is present as well
as a mid and lower lung predominant interstitial process,
possibly representing acute interstitial edema superimposed on
underlying emphysema.

Chest CT:
[**2133-2-26**]: No pulmonary embolus seen. Extensive distortion of the
pulmonary
architecture consistent with the patient's known emphysema.
Areas of
consolidation along suture lines within the dependent lungs are
likely
atelectasis secondary to recent surgery.
[**2133-2-18**]: 1. Right-sided chest tube with minimal anterior
right-sided pneumothorax.
2. Right middle lobe solid, ground-glass nodules, new since the
prior
examination. Given the patient's underlying severe diffuse
emphysematous
disease, these nodules warrant followup in three months.
3. Severe atherosclerotic disease of the aorta, and coronary
vessels.
4. Gallstones. Ventral mesh, intact.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 25501**] was admitted for right recurrent apical pneumothorax
on [**2133-2-18**]. He was taken to the operating room by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2133-2-20**] for a right Video-assisted thoracoscopic
right apical blebectomy and mechanical and chemical (1 gram
doxycycline) pleurodesis.  He was extubated in the operating
room and transferred to the PACU.  While in the PACU he
desaturated to the mid 80's his PCO2 was 77%.  He transferred to
the intensive care unit for observation. He was slightly
confused, with two chest tubes to wall suction for over 48
hours.  The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2133-2-23**].
Below is a systems review of his hospital course.

Neuro: The patient's Parkinson's medications were continued. His
PCP and geriatrics followed him while in house. He developed
delirium in the ICU. Geriatrics was consulted followed him
throughout his hospital course and recommended, continue his
home dose of Ativan 0.5 [**Hospital1 **] and Seroquel 12.5 for acute
agitation. No Haldol since would make his Parkinson worse.
Ultram and acetaminophen, Lidoderm patch for pain.  No morphine
secondary to confusion with this narcotics. His delirium
improved.

Pulmonary:  Pulmonary toilet with incentive spirometry,
nebulizers, and mucolytics were continued. The patient had a
good productive yellow cough. The patient's oxygen saturations
were kept in the low 90's initially with shovel mask transition
ed to 4 L Nasal cannula.  On [**2133-2-26**] his saturations decreased
a Chest CT was negative for Pulmonary Embolism.

Chest-tubes: On POD 3, the anterior chest tube was discontinued
with posterior chest tube kept to water seal. CXR was stable,
however small leak persisted. gram right talc pleurodesis and
chest tubes to wall suction for 48 hours.  The chest tube was
clamped on [**2133-2-27**] follow-up chest film showed no pneumothorax.
The chest tube was removed.

Serial chest films: see above report.

CV: He was found to tachycardic in the ICU and low-dose
beta-blocker was started.  He converted to PO with HR 70-90's.
Once stabilized the beta-blocker was titrated off given his
history of severe COPD.  His home dose of felodipine of 5 mg was
continue on admission but decreased to 2.5 mg to allow BP
greater than 110 for cerebral perfusion.

Abd: Stool softeners were given throughout his stay. The
patients diet was advanced and tolerated, however he had poor
appetite. Ensure supplemental shakes were continued. The patient
had adequate bowel movements.

GU/renal: Foley was removed following surgery.  Initially he had
low urine output responded to fluid bolus.  Hyponatremia with
Na+ 131. monitored closely.

ID: no fevers or leukocytosis.

Heme: HCT stable 30-33.

Prophylaxis: SCD's and SQ heparin were instituted for VTE
