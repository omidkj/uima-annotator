HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 64-year-old male
with a history of alcohol use, grade II/III varices,
alcoholic cirrhosis, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which
demonstrated no evidence of recent bleeding performed
secondary to a hematocrit drop in [**2144-8-13**], and a
was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit secondary to
hematemesis.

The patient notes that he began to feel nauseated 36 hour
prior to admission which led decreased oral intake.  He

normal saline.  The patient was noted to have a hematocrit
drop from 39 to 35 after four hours.  Two large-bore
peripheral intravenous lines were placed, and the patient was
administered 2.5 liters of normal saline.  The patient was
started on Protonix intravenously and Octreotide in the
Emergency Department.

Unit, and the Gastrointestinal Service was consulted.  An
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, and grade III
varices were demonstrated in the lower third of the
esophagus.  Four bands were placed near the gastroesophageal
junction for nonbleeding varices.  There was also noted
clotted blood in the stomach.

While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient was
continued on Octreotide, transfused 4 units of packed red
blood cells, and transfused 2 units of fresh frozen plasma.

PROCEDURES/RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  The patient had an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed on [**2144-10-30**] with
findings as in the History of Present Illness.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented to the
Emergency Department with a history of nausea, induced
vomiting, and hematemesis.

The patient subsequent received nasogastric lavage which was
significant for blood that did not clear with several liters

performed in the Intensive Care Unit which demonstrated
grade III varices; however, no active bleeding varices were
visualized.  Four varices were successfully banded near the

while admitted.  Secondary to his coronary artery disease,
his goal hematocrit was greater than 30.  On presentation,
his blood pressure medications were held secondary to his
active bleeding.  The patient's ACE inhibitor, beta blocker,
