Allergies:
Morphine / Tylenol 8 Hr

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 358**]
Chief Complaint:
submassive pulmonary embolism

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
thrombolysis for submassive pulmonary embolism


History of Present Illness:
Patient is 54 yo M with h/o HTN, nephrolithiasis and gout with
FH of thrombosis who is MICU callout for saddle emboli treated
with TPA and on heparin drip on coumadin bridge. Patient
transferred from OSH for same condition after self diagnosis.

No previous history of DVT or PE. States he noted R calf pain
after a work-out approximately 2 weeks prior. He took Diclofenac
for one week with resolution of the pain. Two days prior he
noted left foot and calf swelling. He denies recent travel,
illness or surgery. The night prior to admission, he felt
'stuffy' and with wheezing concerning for pneumonitis. He also
noted SOB with exertion which is unusal for him. The AM of
admission, he went to work and was able to work >1H, then noted
worsening SOB. Took O2 sat, which was 70%/RA. Applied oxygen and
proceeded to nearest radiologist with help of wife who works for
him. CTA positive for saddle emboli. Proceeded to [**Hospital3 **],
initial VS (no noted T), 153/90, 102, 18, 90s on 5L. He had an
Echo showing RV dilation without obvious strain or dysfunction.
He was then given a heparin bolus of 8800u, Demerol 25mg, Ativan
1mg, Zofran 8mg and started on Tpa @ 150mg/hr. Given concern of
instability with saddle emboli, he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**]
MICU for furhter management.
.
ROS negative for recent F/Ch, abdominal pain, N/V, weightloss,
nightsweats, BRBPR, melena or heartburn. He currently endorses
SOB and retrosternal CP. He has not had a screening colonoscopy.



Past Medical History:
HTN
Obese - BMI 37
Gout
s/p Appendectomy [**2156**]
Nephrolithiasis with microscopic hematuria
s/p rib & sternal fracture after biking accident


Social History:
Patient is a Internal medicine physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] denies tobacco or
illegal drug use. He does drink EtOH occasionally. Exercises
regularly.

Family History:
Brother with thrombus s/p ACL repair. Suspects mother died of PE
after SOB for several days, then found dead of unclear causes.

Physical Exam:
VS 96.6, 83, 129/85, 19, 98 on NRB
Gen: NAD, breathing comfortably with NRB
HEENT: Symmetric, PERRL, oropharynx clear with MMM
CV: RRR without m/g/r, clear S1, S2
PULM: Shallow breathing, states painful with deep inspiration,
CTAB
ABD: Active bowel tones. Soft, NT, no masses
Ext: LE asymmetry, L>R slightly without erythema or pain on
palpation
Neuro: A&O x 3, moving all extremities, CNII-XII grossly intact


Pertinent Results:
[**10-23**] TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal (LVEF >55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler
imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position
consistent with mild right ventricular pressure overload. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated right ventricle with mild hypokinesis
and mildly increased right sided pressures. Normal left
ventricular global and regional function.

CXR: Of note, the lateral CP angles were not included on the
film.

Cardiac size is top normal. There is no evident pneumothorax.
Faint ill-
defined opacity in the right mid lung zone corresponds to a
consolidation in
the right middle lobe, that is better seen in CTA from the same
day earlier.
Followup until resolution is recommended. There is no evidence
of CHF.

LENIS: LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale, color, and
pulse wave Doppler
ultrasound of the lower extremities was performed to evaluate
for deep venous
thrombosis. The left popliteal vein demonstrates expansive,
occlusive
thrombus with no identifiable flow, and non-compressibility of
the vein. The
thrombus extends into the left posterior tibial veins, where no
flow is
identified on color imaging. The left common femoral vein and
superficial
femoral vein demonstrate normal compressibility, with
respiratory phasicity of
flow and normal responses to augmentation and Valsalva maneuver.


The right lower extremity demonstrates normal respiratory
phasicity of flow in
the common femoral vein, greater saphenous vein, superficial
femoral vein, as
well as popliteal vein. There are normal responses to
augmentation and
Valsalva maneuver.

IMPRESSION:

1. Occlusive DVT in the left popliteal and posterior tibial
veins.

2. No DVT in the right lower extremity.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 54 yo M h/o HTN, nephrolithiasis and gout with FH
of thrombosis with submassive PE s/p thrombolyis with TPA and
anticoagulation with heparin drip switched to lovenox and with
coumadin bridge.

Patient was transferred from OSH after getting CTA diagnosis of
submassive PE and was admitted to the MICU for thrombolysis with
TPA and respiratory status monitoring. Echo was done with showed
some evidence of RV strain but the patient was hemodynamically
stable. LENIs were done which showed evidence of DVT. IVC filter
is not a consideration at this time. Anticoagulation was done
with heparin and the patient was switched to lovenox with
coumadin bridge. PCP to follow up INR on Monday. Target INR is
[**2-2**]. PCP to follow up OSH hypercoagubility studies. Plerutic
chest pain was controlled oxycodone and ibprofen. Renal function
was monitored in setting of NSAID administartion and the patient
was placed on PPI.

# HTN: On Cozaar as outpatient. Given potential for HD
instability, will hold for now.
- Cozaar to be restarted by PCP if needed
- Monitor for HD instability on telemetry

# Nephrolithiasis: With h/o occult hematuria. Given
anticoagulation, will continue to monitor uop for signs of frank
hematuria.

# Gout: Continue Allopurinol.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary: Submassive pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis,
s/p thrombolysis
Secondary: hypertension


Discharge Condition:
stable


Discharge Instructions:
You were transferred from an outside hospital for a submassive
pulmonary embolism for which you received TPA thrombolysis. You
were admitted to the intensive care unit and you were monitored
for respiratory distress. You were placed on a heparin drip and
this was switched to lovenox and you were bridged with coumadin
for long term coagulation. The source of your pulmonary embolism
warrants further workup. Some lab tests for coagulation
disorders were sent at an outside hospital and will be followed
up by your PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 2172**] PCP will use this to determine the course
of your anticoagulation treatment which will be a minimum of 6
months
