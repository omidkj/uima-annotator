Admission Date:  [**2165-7-31**]     Discharge Date:  [**2165-8-2**]


Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old man
with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2146**], who was admitted to
the cardiac care unit status post percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty stent, effectively a saphenous vein
graft.  The procedure was complicated by a small perforation
of the saphenous vein graft.  The patient was here for
monitoring.  The patient had known coronary artery disease,
status post myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass
grafting in [**2146**].  He did well postoperatively.  At baseline,
he ambulated around 20 minutes two times a day with a cane.
He was somewhat winded after climbing stairs.  He had no
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema or
sublingual nitroglycerin use times three years.

Approximately three weeks ago, the patient experienced [**3-26**]
substernal chest pain with heartburn while at rest and
spontaneous resolution after one hour.  An outpatient stress
test showed reversible defects.  The elective cardiac
catheterization on the date of admission revealed an 80%
lesion of the saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse
marginal artery and second obtuse marginal artery with stent
placement complicated by a small perforation.  The patient
was admitted for monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass grafting in [**2146**] times four vessels.
2.  Asthma and mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3.  Proximal cancer, status post transurethral resection of
prostate.
4.  Vertigo.
5.  Pacemaker secondary to complete heart block.
6.  Status post inguinal hernia repair.
7.  Erythromelalgia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications on admission included
Coreg, Flovent, Serevent, aspirin, Zocor, Ativan, Flomax and
Claritin.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The review of systems was negative aside
from that mentioned in the History of Present Illness.

ALLERGIES:  The patient had allergies to codeine, amoxicillin
and shellfish.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, the patient was resting on
his back complaining of backache.  Vital signs revealed the
patient to be afebrile with a pulse of 89, a blood pressure
of 129/84, a pulmonary artery pressure of 50/30 with a mean
of 37, a respiratory rate of 19 and an oxygen saturation of
96%.  Pulses were 5 to 7 mm.  On head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat examination, the pupils were equal, round and reactive
to light and accommodation.  The extraocular movements were
intact.  The sclerae were anicteric.  The mucous membranes
were dry.  The neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.

The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  There was
jugular venous pressure of around 6 cm.  Carotids were normal
with 1+ upstrokes bilaterally and no bruits.  There was a
regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2, no S3 or S4
and a II/VI holosystolic murmur.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender and nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.
The extremities had no edema, clubbing or cyanosis.  There
were 2+ pulses bilaterally.  The left arterial sheath was in
place.

LABORATORY:  The CBC, coagulation studies and Chem 7 were
within normal limits.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:  The cardiac catheterization that
took place revealed pulmonary artery pressures of 30/17 with
a mean of 24, a wedge pressure of 18, left main coronary
artery stenosis at 99% with the left anterior descending
artery being given blood flow via a saphenous vein graft to
the diagonal artery and then the left anterior descending
artery and the left circumflex coronary artery being given
blood flow via a saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse
marginal artery and second obtuse marginal artery with 80%
stenosis.  The right coronary artery had 99% mid stenosis,
but it was filling via collateral circulation.  A stent was
placed of 5.0 x 13 with a second one placed secondary to
plaque extrusion complicated by perforation, small and
localized after deployment of the second stent.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the cardiac
care unit and monitored with clinical examination for any
evidence of pericardial effusion.  The patient was stable in
the cardiac care unit after the first day.  An echocardiogram
was done that evening at 4 PM, which was negative for any
evidence of pericardial effusion.

On the next day, the patient was transferred to the floor.
We continued to monitor the pulses for any evidence of
pericardial effusion, chest pain or dyspnea.  The patient was
completely asymptomatic for the rest of his hospital course
and was discharged on [**2165-8-2**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home with
follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] had already
made this appointment with the patient.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  The patient should continue on his
outpatient regimen of Flovent, Serevent, aspirin 81 mg,
Zocor, Ativan h.s., Flomax and Claritin.  He should also take
Coreg at a dose of 1.56 mg p.o. q.d., which was approximately
one half tablet.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Cardiac catheterization with stent placement and no
pericardial effusion.
