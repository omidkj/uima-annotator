Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**4-2**] Direct current cardioversion
[**4-5**] Cardiac catheterization
[**4-8**] 1. Replacement of ascending and hemi-arch aorta aneurysm
with a
    32-mm Gelweave Dacron graft.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1557**] is a 71 year-old female with history of atrial
fibrillation and CHF (since [**November 2178**] per pt) who presented to
[**Hospital3 **] last night for dyspnea. She reports that she had
been having increased dyspnea for the 2 days prior to admission;
of note, she ran out of her medications 4 days prior to
admission & was unable to refill them. She was found to be in
atrial fibrillation with RVR in the 150s per OSH report. EKG
showed atrial fibrillation w/ LBBB & no ischemic changes. Her
first troponin was 0.44, with an increase to 0.99 on her second.
INR on arrival to OSH was 12 and she was given 10 mg of vitamin
K; repeat INR today at 9. She was also given lipitor, 4 mg
morphine, ASA 325mg, and lasix 40mg IV & diltiazem 25mg IV. Beta
blocker was held [**3-3**] low BP. She was started on a diltiazem gtt
for HR control.

She has a known abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 6.8 cm (most
recently was 6.0 cm). She became confused after getting morphine
in the ED. A head CT was done which was normal.  Per report, her
mental status is improving as the morphine wears off.  Vitals
prior to transfer were BP 107/46, HR 80's, Sat 99-100% on 2L.

On arrival to the floor, VS 97.5 125/62 115 16 98%2L NC. Patient
appeared mildly diaphoretic, but comfortable. Currently
endorsing mild dyspnea.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
Per HPI; additionally, patient endorses mild dyspnea (all the
time, even at rest, not particularly exacerbated on exertion).
Also c/o fatigue, increased thirst & decreased appetite/PO
intake for the past 1-2 weeks. States that she has been drinking
lots of water & pineapple juice. C/o chronic back, joint &
muscle pain from fibromyalgia. R>L LE edema when she was volume
overloaded in the past (although not currently).

Denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
# CARDIOLGY

[**2179-4-5**] Cardiac Cath
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated no obstructive coronary artery disease. There was
mild plaquing in the mid-LCA and first diagonal with maximal
stenoses of 40%. The remainder of the coronary arteries were
free of angiographically apparent disease.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal resting central
aortic pressures.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Non-obstructive coronary artery disease.
2. Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm.

[**2179-4-2**] TTE
IMPRESSION: Large ascending aortic aneurysm with effacement of
sinotubular junction and moderate to severe functional aortic
valve regurgitation. Symmetric LVH with normal global and
regional biventricular systolic function. Moderate mitral and
tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

# RADIOLOGY

[**2179-4-6**] CXR (PA/Lat)
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**5-2**], there is continued
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. The pulmonary vascularity
is now essentially within normal limits. Tortuosity of the aorta
is again seen. No evidence of acute focal pneumonia or pleural
effusion.

Conclusions
Pre Bypass:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 40 - 45%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is severely dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is moderately dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**1-31**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

Post Bypass:
The patient is on epinephrine and phenylephrine infussions,
being AV paced with cardiac index 2.8.
There is a well seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic
position, there is no aortic regurgitation.
There is a tube graft in the ascending
