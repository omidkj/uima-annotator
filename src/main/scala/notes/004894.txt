Attending:[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 812**]
Chief Complaint:
epistaxis/hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy x 2
Pulmonary angiography x 2

History of Present Illness:
48 yo male with a distant smoking history on Plavix for stents
presenting with hemoptysis for two days. The patient stated that
he first had symptoms two nights prior to admission when he woke
from his sleep coughing blood. He went back to sleep without
trouble. He had another episode of hemoptysis (walnut sized) in
the shower. He went to his doctor that afternoon and noted that
he had a blood clot sitting on his soft palate. The bleeding
became worse on the night prior to admission. At that time, he
was continuously coughing blood and drove himself to the
emergency room.
.
In the emergency room, the patient presented with vitals of T:
98.8, HR: 107, BP: 159/84, RR: 16, O2 sat: 94%. An NG lavage
revealed no blood in the stomach. There was concern for
intrathoracic process such as a pulmonary embolism, though D
dimer was normal. He had a chest CT which showed ground glass
opacities. He was admitted to the floor for further evaluation
of his hemoptysis.
.
The patient said that he has had blood-tinged sputum in the past
related to the change of weather and dry air, but never to this
extent.
.
No chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dizziness,
nausea, diarrhea.
.
+recent weight loss due to gastric banding procedure

Radiology Report	CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY	Study
Date of [**2174-9-22**] 4:36 AM

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Multifocal areas of ground-glass opacities, particularly in
the right
lung, which are nonspecific, but likely reflect a multifocal
pneumonia.
3. Bronchial wall thickening with occlusion of several airway
segments to the
right upper and middle lobes, particularly in the right middle
lobe, likely
from mucus or with history of hemoptysis, blood.

Radiology Report	[**Numeric Identifier 70295**] SEL CATH 1ST ORDER	Study Date of [**2174-9-22**]
1:28 PM

IMPRESSION:
1. Normal thoracic aortogram.
2. Aortogram of a solitary intercostal bronchial trunk on the
right side
demonstrating no evidence for extravasation or abnormal blush.
Of note, this
vessel did have supply to the mediastinum and other midline
structures. No
intervention performed.
3. Normal right bronchial arteriogram demonstrating supply to
the right lower
lobe.

Radiology Report	[**Numeric Identifier 96893**] 3ED ORDER [**Last Name (un) **]/BRACHIOCEPHALIC	Study Date
of [**2174-9-23**] 2:17 AM

IMPRESSION: Selective right internal mammary, right subclavian
and two right
bronchial arteriograms were obtained. No evidence of
extravasation, blush, or
aneurysms could be noticed. All bronchial arteries and branches
presented
with very small caliber. No embolization was attempted via the
right
bronchial intercostal trunk due to supply of midline arteries,
likely directed
towards the spine.

[**9-26**]  Bronchoscopy

IMPRESSION:  Hemoptysis which was related on a previous
procedure to the posterior segment of the right upper lobe,
status post 2 angiograms by interventional radiology with no
embolization performed and status post repeat flexible
bronchoscopy today with a large blood clot in the right upper
lobe bronchus.

PLAN:  We will continue to monitor the patient for the time
being while off Plavix and continue to follow along with
thoracic surgery for the possible need of right upper lobe
lobectomy if the bleeding recurs.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Hemoptysis:
The patient presented with hemoptysis and had an episode of
epistaxis while in the ER. A CT of the chest revealed
non-specific multi-focal ground glass opacities, particularly in
the right lung, and bronchial wall thickening with occlusion of
several airway segments to the right upper and middle lobes.
The patient was observed in the ICU because of the large volume
hemoptysis.  He underwent a bronchoscopy by interventional
pulmonology, but they were unable to visualize the source of the
bleeding because of the large amount of blood in the right upper
lobe. He underwent IR angiography, but they were not able to
visualize the vessel because it was not actively bleeding. The
patient was transferred to the general medical floor
post-procedure where he continued to have small volume
hemoptysis.  Interventional radiology repeated the angiography
but was unable to embolize an artery because there was no active
bleed.  The patient underwent a second bronchoscopy on [**2174-9-26**],
where a clot was found to be nearly occluding the right upper
lobe; the clot was not removed for concern of re-activating the
original bleed.  [**Doctor First Name **], ANCAs, anti-GBM AB, HIV Ab, and PPD were
negative.  His plavix was held since admission, and his
hematocrit remained stable in the low 30s after an initial drop
from Hct 42 in the ED.  The patient did not require any blood
transfusions.  He did get one unit of platelets
