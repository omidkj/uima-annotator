Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Diltiazem

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
bradycardia and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endo-tracheal intubation
Central line placement


History of Present Illness:
77m with HTN, paroxysmal afib, CHF with lvh and preserved EF,
PUD presented to VA urgent care on [**11-9**] with three days of
increasing dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and LE edema, with no
chest discomfort or palpitations. He was found there to be
afebrile with bp 115/72, hr 130, rr 20, and spo2 97%ra; his
lungs had bibasilar rales, and his periphery showed 1+ edema.
His ECG showed afib and flutter with pvc's, and a CXR showed
CHF. He was given diltiazem 20mg IV once, prompting a transition
to a-flutter in the 80's, with his bp dropping to 60's-70's. He
was given NS and then a dopamine drip. He became minimally
responsive so was intubated. On dopamine, his bp came up to the
120's and hr back up to the 130's, and he was transferred for
further management. In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was given calcium and
glucagon with little response, remaining hypotensive, so he was
cardioverted with 50 joules, resulting in sinus bradycardia. His
bp was in the 90's on a low dose of a norepi gtt (changed from
dopa for tachycardia and ectopy).

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. Normal
interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler. The IVC is >2.5cm in
diameter with no
change with respiration (estimated RAP >20 mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Severe global
LV hypokinesis. No LV mass/thrombus. No resting LVOT gradient.
No VSD. TSI
demonstrates no significant LV dyssynchrony with no significant
delay in peak
systolic contraction between opposing walls.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. RV function
depressed.

AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus. Moderately dilated
ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild to moderate
([**11-21**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
to moderate
[[**11-21**]+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: The end-diastolic PR velocity
is increased
c/w PA diastolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium and right atrium are moderately dilated. No
atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate
symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi
are seen in
the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Tissue
synchronization imaging demonstrates no significant left
ventricular
dyssynchrony. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. The aortic root
is moderately
dilated athe sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**11-21**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The
end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased
suggesting
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severely depressed LVEF.

cxr [**2158-11-9**]
FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in
supine position demonstrates the presence of an ETT terminating
in the trachea some 6 cm above the level of the carina. The
inflated cuff distends the trachea locally by some millimeters.

An NG tube has been placed seen to reach below the diaphragm. No
pneumothorax is present. Diffuse perivascular haze is noted on
this portable examination and the patient appears to be in
pre-edema state. Density in left lower lobe area is noted,
obliterating the contour of the descending aorta as well as the
central portion of the left diaphragm indicative of
atelectasis-infiltrate. Further followup recommended.




Brief Hospital Course:
77m with htn, afib/flutter, chf with preserved ef, prostate ca
s/p prostatectomy who presented with sx of increasing volume
overload, was found to be in aflutter, and became bradycardic
and hypotensive following administration of IV diltiazem
requiring pressors and intubation.
.
#Shock/Pump -- His original presenting hypotension was felt to
be mixed type in nature, with distributive component likely from
the diltiazem (he has had this same response to the same drug in
[**6-/2156**], with similar p
