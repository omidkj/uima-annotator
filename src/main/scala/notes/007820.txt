Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
  21 year-old developmentally-delayed male with restrictive lung
disease (s/p placement of multiple pulmonary stents in [**2201**])
secondary to severe kyphoscoliosis presenting with worsening
hypercarbic respiratory failure. His PCO2 is normally in the 60s
(per OMR) but were worse on admission (103). Per caretaker, the
patient has been having steadily increasing O2 requirements over
the last 6 weeks and has not been able to perform his usual
activities. He is normally on 2L Nasal O2 at home with O2 sats
98-100%. During the week before admission, he required 4L O2 to
keep O2 sats above 90%. He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 **] for
multifocal PNA in [**6-19**].
.
Per caretaker, the patient has been complaining of cough over
the last week. The patient is mostly non-verbal. He can utter
short phrases, but is NOT TO BE TAKEN at face value, i.e., when
offered food, he may say he is not hungry even though he has not
eaten that day. He is able to vocalize pain and discomfort with
pointing. He is ambulatory (with assistance) at baseline and is
normally incontinent of urine and stool.
.
He presented to the ED on [**2204-9-1**] with HR=120s, BP=140/70,
RR=24, 96% on 2L. ABG showed pH=7.34, pC02=103, pO2=79. CTA
showed worsening volume loss of right lung and left-sided
pulmonary edema with possible multifocal infection. He was given
ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and vancomycin. He was admitted
directly to the ICU for further management. In the ICU, he had
episodes of desaturation to the mid-50s; these improved rapidly
with face mask and nebulizer treatment. He did not require
intubation. His antibiotics were changed to levofloxacin and
Unasyn for treatment of pneumonia. Repeat ABGs showed
improvement in pC02 and p02, and he was transferred to the floor
for further management. He was then transferred to the floor.
.
On the floor this morning at approximately 4:30 am, he was found
to be acutely agitated, he had removed his oxygen and was
desaturating into the teens - he became cyanotic and
unresponsive. A gas shortly after this revealed a pco2 of 109 -
up from his baseline of pCo2 of 60. On replacing his oxygen by
face mask (100%), he recovered his sats, his color, and his
responsiveness. He is transferred to the MICU for continual O2
monitoring.

Data:
CXR of this am (6am):
The chest cage is markedly deformed. There is a scoliosis
concave to the left and a relatively small right hemithorax.
Spinal stabilization rods in place are intact but precise
location is not assessed by this examination. The proximal
portion of a left bronchial stent is obscured by the rods. The
distal portion is proximal to the lobar branching of the left
main bronchus.

Left lung is severely consolidated and heterogeneous
opacification of the right lung has progressed since [**9-1**].
Findings could be due to pulmonary edema alone, or widespread
pneumonia. Given the chest deformity, heart size is difficult to
assess but it appears larger on today's examination than in
[**2201**].
.
A/P: 21 year-old developmentally-delayed male with an extensive
history of restrictive lung disease admitted [**9-1**] with worsening
respiratory failure secondary to ? post-obstructive pneumonia
who had an episode of desaturation to the teens with cyanosis
and transient unresponsiveness on the medical floor early this
am transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring.
.
1. hypercarbic respiratory failure
Exacerbation due to possible post-obstructive pneumonia and
atelectasis. This is in addition to the patient's background of
chronic restrictive lung disease secondary to kyphoscoliosis. ?
bronchiomalacia worsening ventilation (as evidenced by CT scan)

- repeat ABG now that appears at baseline to evaluate for
resolution
- Cont face mask, NIPPV if decompensates
- cont. xopenex neb q 4 hours and acetylcysteine nebs prn
.
2. ? pneumonia
Possible post-obstructive pneumonia given bronchiomalacia,
restrictive defects.
- continue levo 500 mg daily
- continue metronidazole 500 mg IV tid (changed from unasyn to
this [**9-3**])
- f/u blood cultures
.
3. Restrictive lung disease, s/p instrumentation;
broncheomalacia. Stents in place for CT. To be seen by
interventional pulmonology today to evaluate for possible bronch
tomorrow to re-evaluate airways.
- follow-up IP recs
- NPO in anticipation of possible bronch today
.
4. Cardiac
Patient has a history of valvular disease with trace MR and
normal EF. He has RA enlargement and RVH on CT scan, mild
pericardial effusion. [**9-3**] echocardiogram shows normal left
atrium and left ventricle with EF of 60%. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with depressed right ventricular systolic
function. Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and a
small pericardial effusion were observed.
- continue to follow in ICU

possible bronch today. Per [**Doctor Last Name **] mother, the patient is able to
feed himself at baseline.
