History of Present Illness:
This is a 62 year old woman who was found to be unresponsive at
home by her husband and brought to an outside hospital after she
was intubated in the field. CT scan of the head done at the OSH
showed a large left basal ganglia IPH with midline shift and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical evaluation.

Neuro:
Mental status: intubated, not sedated
no eye opening

Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD [**2-12**]
1. Large hematoma centered in the left basal ganglial with
extension into the ventricles. The etiology is most likely
hypertensive.
2. Associated rightward shift of midline structures results in
compression of the third ventricle and trapping of the right
lateral ventricle.

CT HEAD [**2-13**]
1. S/p left craniectomy with decreased rightward shift of the
midline
structures and slightly decreased trapping of the right lateral
ventricle.
2. No residual concern for left uncal herniation.
3. Large left hematoma centered in the basal ganglia has only
slightly
decreased in size.

CT HEAD [**2-14**]

1. Persistent large left basal ganglionic parenchymal hemorrhage

with stable 1 cm rightward shift of normally midline structures.


Lower ext dopplers [**2-18**]
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in bilateral lower
extremities.

Upper extremity dopplers [**2-19**]
1. Occlusive thrombus within the right basilic vein which is a
part of the
superficial venous system.
2. No evidence of DVT in bilateral internal jugular, axillary,
or brachial
veins

CDIFF Cultures- Positive [**2-18**]


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the neurosurgery service and taken
to the O.R for an emergent left hemicraniectomy. The procedure
went well with no complications and post operatively she was
transferred to the ICU for further care. On her postoperative
exam she was extensor posturing in both upper extremities and
she had asmetric pupils with left greater than right but they
still remained reactive. A post op head CT showed a slight
decrease in the size of the hematoma and postoperative changes.
On [**2-13**] she had coag positive staph in her sputum and surgical
bone flap.

On [**2-14**] her exam slightly worsened and she had no movement in
her RUE and had weak flexion in her LUE. She continued to
withdraw both her lower extremities. A head CT was obtained and
this showed slight increase in swelling and she recieved 25g of
mannitol with goal serum osm of 300-320. She continued to have
poor exam.  Mannitol was held due to high serum sodiums and
osmolalities. She was monitored with EEG for seizure activity
and seizures were controlled with the addition of Keppra to the
Dilantin.

On [**2-18**], her stool cultures were positive for C-Diff and she was
started on Flagyl 500mg q8. Vancomycin was later added for
treatment of this infection.

On [**2-19**] a family meeting was held to discuss prognosis and
outcome with the son. In that meeting the son, boyfriend, and
cousin decided that the patient would have wished to live long
term on life support regardless of her fuctional status.

On [**2153-2-21**], the patient's family was consented for a trach/PEG
and IVC filter in preparation for long term life support. On
[**2-22**] she was taken to the OR by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a trach/PEG and
IVC filter. She tolerated these procedures well with no
complications. Post operatively she was taken back to the SICU
for further care.

On [**2-23**] her tube feeds were started via her PEG. Her staples were
discontinued without issues at the bedside. On [**2-24**] she was
febrile with a WBC count of 21. A fever work up was initiaed.
Her corneal reactivity improved. There were sutures at the
inferior wound margin  and these were removed.   On [**2-25**] her WBC
continue to climb and remain febrile.Her sputum cultures grew
coagulase positive staph and she was placed on vancomycin and
cefipime.  An abdominal CT scan was obtained which demonstrated
a small amount of pneumoperitneum consistent with recent PEG
placement and no concern for infection. Her neuro exam has
remained stable and poor: PERRLA, no movement of upper
extremities and triple flexion of lower extremities; wound is
well healed.
