cardiomypathy (EF 15-20%) and morbid obesity who presents with
shortness of breath, lower extremity edema and abdominal
distention for the past 2 weeks. He states that on the day of
admission ([**2191-12-24**]) he felt short of breath and a chest tightness
described as "pulling" sensation in the center of his chest,

worsened in the past few weeks. He denies overt chest pain, PND,
diarrhea, constipation, fever, chills, night sweats, nausea,
vomiting, dysuria. ROS is positive for chronic cough x 1 year.
He was supposed to have an EP study with or without AICD
placement on [**11-20**] that was postponed to [**2193-1-2**] for symptoms
akin to a cold. (No record in chart)

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

In the ED, initial vitals were 99.6 63 146/95 32 95% RA. He
triggered in the ED for tachypnea with a RR of 32 and his HR was
110-120s and sinus during his ED stay. He received 1 SL NTG, ASA
325mg and Lasix 40mg IV x 1, to which he put out 850ml of urine
and reported feeling improvement in symptoms

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32362**] is a 24 year old man with a history of non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy, NYH Class II CHF, EF 15-20% who presents with
DOE/SOB over one month, acutely over one week. He was treated
for acute on chronic CHF exacerbation. He was diuresed with IV
and then PO lasix, achieving a net negative balance of ~ 7
litres. He was discharged to optimize his fluid status prior to
an AICD placement

By Problem
1. Acute on Chronic CHF Exacerbation: Underlying etiology for
patient's chronic heart failure was presumed to be viral in
origin, could also be related to cocaine use in years prior to
diagnosis or alcohol abuse.  All lab testing negative except for
RSV, including HIV, EBV, CMV, Lyme, RPR.  Current exacerbation
likely due to poor dietary compliance as patient does not weigh
himself daily and could easily become overloaded particularly in
the context of the Holidays.  He denied any medication
noncompliance.  The patient was aggressively diuresed with iV
furosemide and by time of discharge he was 7 litres net negative
and sent home on 40 mg of PO furosemide [**Hospital1 **].

2. Tachycardia: The patient had CHF with rates around 100-130 at
presentation.  This appears to be a chronic problem per previous
notes.  This improved somewhat with diuresis and improvement of
his respiratory status. Doses of metoprolol were increased over
hospitalization without change in heart rate (100-120 on
telemetry).  The patient should have an AICD for purposes of
primary prevention given his low EF.  Plans are underway to
finish this as an outpatient.  He was discharged on 100 mg
Toprol XL [**Hospital1 **]

3. Iron Deficiency Anemia: The patient continued to be
microcytic with indices suggestive of iron deficiency. He is
also hemoglobin AC which could explain some microcytosis. No
signs of active bleeding and previous CT [**Last Name (un) **] was negative. He
was discharged on iron TID with ascorbic acid for absorption and
senna/colace for constipation

4: Hyperbilirubinemia/ Liver Dysfunction: Patient had a slightly
elevated INR and bilirubin at presentation with normal
transaminases.  Both of these parameters were slightly above his
previous values though he doe have a known element of
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (defined by ALT/AST and US/CT
evidence of fatty infiltration). Given his two presumptive
diagnoses (NAFLD/NASH and Conge
