HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old with a
history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
multiple compression fractures who received her care at [**Hospital3 **] who presents for elective vertebroplasty.  She has
had significant pain and decreased ability to do activities
underwent vertebroplasty of the T6 and T9 levels on [**2110-5-29**]
here at [**Hospital1 69**].  She then
presented on the 8th for elective vertebroplasty at levels
T10, T11, T12 and L1.  The procedure went well without
difficulty.  However, post procedure she had decreased oxygen
saturation to the 70's and so was admitted to the Medicine
Service initially for observation.
Her sats are typically 91 to 92% on two liters of home O2
secondary to her severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
and she has poor respiratory reserve.

After the procedure when her sats dropped into the 80's she
received nebulizers and 6 liters nasal cannula and her sats
came up to 90 to 91%  However, she remained oxygen dependent.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on chronic
home O2.  Baseline pCO2 in the high 40's with baseline peak

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She quit smoking after a 100 to 150 pack
year history.  She quit approximately ten years ago.  No
alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is an obese elderly woman in mild
respiratory distress who has a temperature of 97.8, blood
pressure of 124/78, pulse 86, respiratory rate of 22, sating
91 to 92% on room air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
exam is unremarkable.  Her heart is regular with no murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Her lungs are diffusely wheezy.  Her
abdomen is obese and benign.  Extremities are without edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the medical
floor.  She continues to have a high oxygen requirement.  She
was treated for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation with intravenous Solu Medrol that was then
changed to oral Prednisone and tapered.  She also received
frequent nebulizer treatment.  Chest x-ray demonstrated
[**Hospital1 **]-lobar pneumonia of the left upper and left upper lobes.
She was started on Levo and Flagyl for a 14 day course.  On
the day of transfer she was day seven of 14 from her
Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  Her chest x-rays were showing
slight improvement by the time of transfer.  Her respiratory
status worsened initially secondary to her pneumonia
requiring a brief Intensive Care Unit stay for close
monitoring and frequent nebulizer treatments.

As her pneumonia improved, she returned to the medical floor.
Her respiratory status was greatly improved by the time of
transfer.  She will likely need pulmonary rehabilitation upon
discharge.  She was transferred to [**Hospital3 **] where she
gets the majority of her care under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12184**] for the rest
of her hospital needs as well as a transfer to
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Vertebroplasty at T10, T11, T12 and L1 for compression
    fractures secondary to osteoporosis.
2.  Multi-lobar pneumonia likely secondary to aspiration,
    peri-intubation.
