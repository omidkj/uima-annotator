Chief Complaint:
Hypoxemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
77 year-old male with CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 25-30%),
CKD, and atrial fibrillation admitted with decreased oxygen
saturation, fever, productive cough. He is telemonitored for
oxygen saturation. One week prior to admission he was noted to
have oxygen saturation in low 90s. Over the week his oxygen
saturation progressively decreased, dropping to 81% without
improvement with cough/deep breathing on day of admission.
During this time period he has also had fevers to 101.8 (and has
since taken Tylenol on scheduled basis), night sweats, cough
initially dry and now productive with yellow/white sputum. He
has also had clear rhinorrhea, nausea without emesis. Also with
chest pressure this morning relieved with SLNTG x1.
.
[**Name (NI) **] wife spoke with his providers this morning and planned
to bring him in for urgent appointment. He progressively became
more dyspneic and nauseous and was brought from home via EMS to
the emergency department.
.
In the ED, 99.8 82 124/37 22 95% 3L NC. Laboratory data
significant for BNP 3272, trop 0.07, creatinine 2.2, hematocrit
29.1. ABG on facemask 7.49/33/163, lactate 1.0. Chest radiograph
2V with LLL opacity, left pleural effusion, and mild prominence
of pulmonary vasculature. EKG with LAD, 1st degree AV block,
RBBB reportedly unchanged from prior. He received levofloxacin,
vancomycin, albuterol neb, and Lasix 100mg IV x1.
.
On arrival to the medical service, he was noted to be dyspneic
and having difficulty speaking in complete sentences. He was
also diaphoretic and transitioned to NRB for low oxygen
saturation; also noted to be tachypneic to upper 30s. Repeat ABG
on NRB 7.46/36/77. He emphasized he does not want to be
intubated, but stated he would be willing to try BiPAP briefly
if it helps with his shortness of breath.
.

MICROBIOLOGY:
[**2127-3-12**] 5:30 pm Influenza A/B by DFA (nasopharyngeal swab)
**FINAL REPORT [**2127-3-13**]**
DIRECT INFLUENZA A ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2127-3-13**]): POSITIVE FOR
INFLUENZA A VIRAL ANTIGEN.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2127-3-12**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Opacity obscuring left hemidiaphragm, which may be reflective
of atelectasis, pleural effusion, and superimposed infection,
cannot be entirely excluded.
2. Small left pleural effusion.
3. Reticular opacities involving the right lung base, better
characterized on CT chest of [**2126-8-13**], unchanged.
4. Mild prominence of pulmonary vasculature, likely reflective
of increased pulmonary vascular pressure.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2127-3-17**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-14**], there is
continued diffuse
bilateral pulmonary opacifications. Considering the clinical
history, this
most likely represents a combination of widespread pneumonia and
severe
pulmonary edema, though superimposed development of ARDS would
have to be
considered. There is mild left pleural effusion. Intact midline
sternal
wires persist.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted with hypoxemia and dyspnea. Was originally sent
to medical floor, though quickly decompensated there and had to
be transferred to MICU after requiring non-rebreather to
maintain oxygen sats in 90s. Patient clearly stated he would not
want intubation, but initially agreed to try non-invasive
ventilation. Upon arrival to the MICU, patient had desat to 70s
on facemask and thus was placed on non-invasive ventilation. He
was treated with broad antibiotics for pneumonia. Had a flu swab
sent for rule-out of influenza and was started on empiric
oseltamivir. Also treated for acute heart failure decompensation
with furosemide and morphine. Patient did not tolerate the
non-invasive ventilation due to discomfort with mask and thus
was placed on non-rebreather. On [**2127-3-14**], influenza screen
returned position. Due to worsening CXR and intermittent
hypoxemia to low 80s on non-rebreather, the team had a
discussion with family that patient may not make it through
illness. They were presented option of continued maximal care
short of intubation or CMO and after discussion with patient's
primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 28092**] to see if patient could recover in
next several days. Patient was given morphine intermittently for
dyspnea, from [**3-14**] to [**3-17**]. He was also diuresed with furosemide
drip and bolus furosemide until creatine increased and urine
output slowed. He remained hypoxemic despite diuresis. On
morning of [**3-17**] he became unresponsive to his wife and continued
to fatigue from his breathing. [**Name (NI) **] wife and family decided
on morning of [**2127-3-17**] to gather family and pursue comfort
measures only. Patient was started on morphine drip and
non-rebreather was removed, patient was pronounced dead at 1701
on [**2127-3-17**]. Family declined autopsy.
