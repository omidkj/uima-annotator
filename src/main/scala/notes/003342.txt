Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 12174**]
Chief Complaint:
Right arm pain/swelling.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left IJ line insertion [**2112-9-20**]

History of Present Illness:
61M with HCC, HCV cirrhosis, CHF, DM, history of CVA with left
sided weakness, PVD, asthma, presenting with one week of RUE
swelling and pain.  He and his VNA first noticed RUE swelling
about one week ago, and feels this has been getting gradually
worse over the course of the week.  It also became painful and
feels somewhat tight and stiff to move.  There has not been
weakness.  His VNA may have noted redness.  No fevers or chills.
 There was also potentially concern fo swelling on the right
side of the face with some symptoms of eye irritation as well
(watery eye, itching, no blurred vision).  He had a presentation
in [**2112-7-6**] with swelling that involved the left arm, but he
felt this was more limited to the L elbow at that time, however
- not involving hand or shoulder.  He had ultrasounds, bone
scan, ortho evaluation, rheum evaluation, all unrevealing.
Possible that this was CRPS, and he was treated with lidocaine
patches.  He denies headache, chest pain, dyspnea, cough,
abdominal pain, N/V/D, change in urination, poor glucose
control.  He does endorse weight gain of 40# "in fluid weight"
in the past 6 months, maybe 20# since last admission which he
thinks is due to kidney stress and needs to have him fluids at
that time.
.
In the ED, afebrile with normal HR/BP/O2 sats.  UENIs without
evidence of proximal/distal clot on R.  Received 12 units
insulin for glucose >400.  Admitted for further workup.

Past Medical History:
ONC HISTORY:
Biopsy-proven HCV cirrhosis since [**2101**].
Noted [**5-/2112**] to have a 4.7 x 4.3 cm right hepatic lobe mass
displaying imaging characteristics consistent with HCC.  Biopsy
showed well-to-moderately differentiated HCC. Further imaging
studies have been limited due to history of contrast nephropathy
requiring hydration (which is further limited by cardiac
concerns).  Discussions of chemoembolization, RFA-sorafenib, ans
sorafenib systemic chemo.

HEENT: PERRL, anicteric.  No obvious ptosis, conjunctival
injection, or periorbital swelling.  Mild general sense of

sensation.  OP clear.
Neck: obese.  JVD elevation difficult to appreciate.
Heart: regular, S1 S2, [**3-13**] SM best at RUSB.  No heave.
Chest: Limited by poor bed mobility.  Preserved air entry
bilaterally without obvious wheezes or crackles, but posterior
exam limited.
Abdomen: obese, +BS, soft, NT, ND.  +pitting abdominal wall and
sacral edema.
Extrem: R arm grossly larger than left both proximal/distal.
Relative increase in both pitting and nonpitting edema.  Pitting
edema most notable in dependent areas.  No obvious erythema
except small area on medial upper arm, which has some increased
tenderness relative to elsewhere.  Tender with excessive touch
of skin.  No sense of tautness of skin relative to other side.
Joint ROM preserved without significant tenderness with passive
motion at each joint.  LLE also with 1-2+ pitting edema, less
painful.  Some chronic venous stasis changes.
Neuro: alert, oriented.  CN II-XII intact.  LUE weak with
limited active movement at elbow and shoulder with some
contracture and muscle atrophy.  RUE with 5/5 strength at each
site except weak finger abduction.  Able to move LLE but with
minimal strength.

.
[**2112-9-16**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Lungs are fully expanded and clear.
There is no apical mass. Pleural surfaces are smooth. No
pneumothorax. Heart is top normal size. Interval increase in
caliber of the upper mediastinum could be due to differences in
patient position or adenopathy, and not necessarily a change. If
there is serious concern for vascular patency, then direct
imaging of the vein should be performed.
.
[**2112-9-15**] RUE DOPPLER U/S: IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the
right upper extremity including the right internal jugular vein
and visualized portions of the subclavian vein.  Extensive soft
tissue edema. Evaluation of the left upper extremity was limited
given inability to properly position the arm. No evidence of
thrombus in the visualized left internal jugular, subclavian,
and cephalic veins.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
61yo man with hepatocellular CA, CHF, HTN, DM, hep C cirrhosis,
PVD, hx of CVA, admitted for RUE cellulitis.  He was started on
ampicillin/sulbactam.  CXR was negative.  You were also started
on bacitracin/polymyxin ointment for a right-eye conjunctivitis.

Active Diagnoses:
# Somnolence: Ddx included hepatic encephelopathy vs. uremia vs.
hypercarbia vs. medication effect (was on gabapentin, baclofen,
MSContin, oxycodone) vs. hypoventilation/OSA. Less likely
etiologies include CVA, more likely hemispheric than brainstem.
Patient has some degree of cirrhosis, but normal EGD in [**Month (only) 547**]
[**2112**], no peripheral stigmata on exam, and synthetic function not
terribly depressed (normal coags, though admission albumin 2.5).
Renal function steadily deteriorating and BUN climbing so this
could likely be a contributing etiology. TSH wnl. Infection also
in ddx, though afebrile, WBC not high
