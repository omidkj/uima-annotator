Date of Birth:   [**2057-12-8**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old
gentleman transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital after a cardiac
catheterization performed at that institution demonstrated
severe aortic stenosis.  He was initially seen there for
increased shortness of breath over the past two months that
was progressive with just about any activity, including tying
his shoes.  He was not complaining of chest pain but stated
that he does have chest pressure that occasionally awakes him
from sleeping.  He has a two to three pillow orthopnea.  He
has not seen a doctor in a number of years prior to this
presentation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  He, therefore, has no known past
medical history of significance.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for syncope, palpitations,
shortness of breath at rest, stroke.  He has no diabetes.  No
hypertension.  No history of cancer.

At the outside hospital, he underwent an echocardiogram that
demonstrated an aortic valve area of 0.8 cm squared and a
peak gradient of 79.  The EF was 10-20%, mild left
ventricular hypertrophy, moderate aortic stenosis, and
moderate aortic regurgitation.  He also had moderate mitral
regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension.  Cardiac
catheterization demonstrated normal coronaries with PA
pressures of 83/36 and a wedge of 52.  By catheterization,
his [**Location (un) 109**] was 0.5 cm squared with a peak gradient of 88 and a
mean gradient of 61.

At the outside hospital, his white count was 8.4, hematocrit
47.2, platelets 265,000.  Coagulation studies were within
normal limits as were his chemistries.  He had a carotid
ultrasound that demonstrated no lesions.  The patient was
subsequently transported to the [**Hospital6 2018**] for further workup.

TRANSFER MEDICATIONS:
1.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Lasix 60 mg IV q.d.
4.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Afebrile at
97.8, heart rate 72, blood pressure 120/70, respiratory rate
18, saturating 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  General: The
patient was in no acute distress.  HEENT:  The mucous
membranes were moist.  There was no erythema.  The pupils
were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodating,
anicteric.  Neck:  Supple with no lymphadenopathy or jugular
venous distention.  Lungs: Clear.  Heart:  Regular.  He had a
III/IV systolic murmur radiating to the carotids.  Abdomen:
Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  Warm, well
perfused with trace edema.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
Medical Service where he was optimized on his cardiac
medications prior to going to the Operating Room on [**2125-4-6**] with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] where he underwent an uncomplicated
aortic valve replacement with a #23 pericardial tissue valve
as well as a mitral valve repair with a #20 annuloplasty
band.  The intraoperative echocardiogram demonstrated mild to
moderately depressed right ventricle.

He was transported to the CRSU intubated on milrinone at 0.5
and Levophed at 0.04.  He stayed intubated and his pressors
were slowly weaned but he remained on the milrinone.  The
first couple of days postoperatively, he had several episodes
of atrial fibrillation for which he was started on an
Amiodarone drip.

By postoperative day number three, he was just on the
Amiodarone as well as Lasix to help with his diuresis.  At
one point, he actually required nitroprusside in order to
bring down his pressure.

He developed a high fever and without an identifiable source
the Infectious Disease Service was consulted.  They
determined that one possible source could be an infected
tooth and, therefore, recommended a Dental consult.  The
decision was made to anticoagulate the patient.
