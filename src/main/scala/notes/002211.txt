Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1363**]
Chief Complaint:
radiofrequency ablation
hypertension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
radiofrequency ablation [**2149-5-7**]

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is a pleasant 80yoF with a history of carcinoid s/p
ilial resection and now radio-frequency ablation of a known
liver metastasis, depression, OSA, hypothyroidism, breast cancer
s/p resection/radiation, who is admitted to the ICU following
her liver met RFA with hypertension to the 240s/160s and
hypoxia.
.
Her presentation began with chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea and
vomitting in the early in the early [**2137**] for which she was
frequently hospitalized.  She underwent ex-laparotomy in [**2140**]
with a resection of her terminal ilium which pathology revealed
as carcinoid tumor.  Following surgery, the patient had almost
complete resolution of her symptoms. However, she continued to
have mild diarrhea in the form of one to two episodes a day and
this frequency slowly increased over the years.  She underwent a
negative GI workup with her outpatient gastroenterologist.  She
developed sweating and flushing.  An abdominal CT in [**9-/2148**]
showed a 2cm solitary liver lesion suspicious for a met, and it
enhanced on an octreotide scan in [**10/2148**] that otherwise showed
no other metastatic burden. Biopsy around that time showed
metastatic carcinoid.  She did have a hospitalization for
hypertensive urgency and thereafter began octreotide depot
injections.  Due to incomplete control over her symptoms over
the following months, she was referred for selective management
of the liver mass with RFA.
.
She underwent uncomplicated RFA on [**2149-5-7**]. Post-procedure, she
was noted to have increasingly labile blood pressures with a
peak of 240/160. She developed a new oxygen requirement,
saturating in the low nineties on 4LNC.  Of note, she uses
home-oxygen set at 5L with activity. She does not require oxygen
at rest. She does have baseline pulmonary dysfunction of unclear
etiology as her [**Name (NI) 11149**] are reportedly normal.
.
On transfer to the ICU, her initial vital signs were: T 96.3
BP142/54  P64  RR19  Sat96/4LNC.  She is comfortable and
sleeping.  She has no lingering pain from her procedure.  She
had mom[**Name (NI) 12823**] chest pain post procedure lasting a few seconds.
No headaches or confusion.  Denying current chest pain or
pressure, no shortness of breath.  No abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting.  No hematuria, dysuria.

Past Medical History:
adapted from recent oncologist note, confirmed for accuracy with
patient.
- Carcinoid as above
- Early stage breast cancer noted on screening mammogram treated
with resection and radiation. Core biopsy [**8-/2145**] demonstrated
grade I, ER and PR positive, HER-2 negative invasive ductal
carcinoma. She underwent left partial mastectomy 10/[**2144**].
Pathology confirmed Stage I grade 1 invasive ductal carcinoma
with papillary features but without angiolymphatic invasion.
Reexcision for close margins showed no evidence of residual
cancer. Recieved 6100cGy radiation therapy to left breast and
axilla from [**11/2145**] to [**1-/2146**] (No lymph node sampling.)
-  Hx of lung nodules followed with imaging which  resolved on
chest CT [**2148-8-28**]. [**2137-12-21**] CT showed a 1.2 cm partially
solid nodule in the right lower lobe, stable compared to CT
[**2147-6-7**]. CT [**2148-2-26**] showed a 6 mm right lower lobe
nodule diminished in size and c/w with inflammation.
- Arthritis/DJD
- Asthma
- History of O2 desaturation (to 87%) with activity. Followed
with [**Year (4 digits) 11149**].
- Sleep apnea. Uses CPAP since [**2145**]
- Depression.
- Hypothyroidism since the age of 36.
- Sjogren's disease
- unspecified "[**Last Name **] problem" followed by cardiology
- hemochromatosis carrier
.
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  In brief, Ms. [**Known lastname 8071**] is an 80 year old
woman who
neuroendocrine tumor of the ileum with positive lymph nodes
found
on laparotomy in [**2140**] after a prolonged course of abdominal
pain,
diarrhea and vomiting. Following surgery her symptoms improved
but she continued to have mild diarrhea. The frequency increased
from [**12-8**] stools per day after surgery to up to 10 times a day
the
fall of [**2147**]. GI work-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] was negative.
Concurrent with slowly progressive diarrhea, the patient also
reports flushing and sweating which increased significantly over
the past few years. CT [**2148-9-25**] showed a new 2 cm solitary
liver enhancing lesion suspicious for metastasis (CT [**2-13**] to
r/o
aortic aneurysm normal by report). Octreotide scan at the time
demonstrated only the hepatic lesion and biopsy of the liver
lesion [**2148-10-8**], demonstrated metastatic carcinoid. In fall
[**2147**] she also had a hypertensive urgency requiring
hospitalization. The patient started on octreotide 20mg IM
qmonth
in [**10/2148**] and increased to 30mg on [**2149-2-26**] due to lack of
response. Of note, prior to starting octreotide the patient
sought consultation with us [**2149-3-10**]. We found her Chromogranin
A
to be elevated at 17 (normal 1.5 to 15) and started her on short
acting octreotide and increased her long acting octreotide to
40mg qmonth as of [**2149-3-21**].
In further detail-
1.  Admission on [**2141-1-12**], for which the patient underwent a
diagnostic laparoscopy with laparotomy and resection of 60 cm of
her ileum in the setting of recurrent partial small bowel
obstruction.  At surgery, she was noted to have an apparent
implant within the mesentery, the mesenteric border of the
intestine.  The pelvis was free of any evidence of tumor.  The
uterus and ovaries were noted to be absent as was the appendix.
The cecum, [**Year (4 digits) 499**], liver, stomach, and the remainder of the small
intestine appeared normal.  In the mid to terminal ileum, there
were two areas of carcinomatous involvement of the small
intestine extending into the bowel from the mesentery.  There
was
a 3-cm diameter node within the small intestinal mesentery.
There were smaller firm shotty lymph nodes along the superior
mesenteric artery, but it was not clear that these were involved
with carcinoma.  Because of the possibility that this
represented
carcinoid, gross resection of all tumor was performed by
performing a resection of the small intestine and the associated
mesentery removing approximately 50 to 60 cm of the ileum.
2.  Pathology from the above laparotomy confirmed carcinoid
tumor
in the ileum.  The proximal and distal resected margins were
negative for tumor, [**4-12**] lymph nodes were positive for metastatic
carcinoid tumor.
3.  On [**2147-1-13**], the patient underwent an endoscopy.  This was
done to rule out carcinoid.  Biopsies were obtained including a
biopsy of the rectosigmoid [**Year (4 digits) 499**] that was consistent with a
hyperplastic polyp.  Minute intramucosal lymphoid aggregate was
identified.
4.  On [**2147-2-13**], the patient underwent a biopsy of a hep
positive right lower lobe lesion under CT guidance.  This did
not
reveal any evidence of cancer.  Multinucleated giant cells as
well as benign appearing epithelial cells and macrophages were
present.
5.  On [**2148-9-9**], the patient underwent pulmonary function
testing.  This revealed mild airflow limitation on [**Year (4 digits) 11149**] with no
significant improvement post bronchodilator administration.
Notation was made of normal lung volumes.  There was moderate
impairment in diffusion capacity.  The patient's DLCO was
reported at 49% of predicted.  Overall, there were changes in
lung function compared to the previous study performed on
[**2148-4-23**].
6.  On [**2148-10-9**], the patient underwent a left liver fine
needle
aspirate that was notable for tumor cells consistent with
carcinoid tumor.  The tumor was noted to be low-grade.
7.  On [**2148-10-23**], the patient underwent an octreotide scan that
was notable for a
