History of Present Illness:
84 y/o M w/dementia, LE edema, and hyperlipidemia, who presented
to ED with acute SOB. This initially happened while he was on
the toilet. His wife called EMS, and he was initially
tachycardiac to 120, bp 112/76, rr 36 . He was diaphoretic,
denied CP. He had CXR at OSH which by report showed assymm pulm
edema R>L. Pt had ECG w/sinus tach, nl axis/int, ST depression
inf/lat. ABG 7.41/25/150 on NRB. He was started on CPAP, given
MS 2 mg IV, Lasix 80 IV, nitro gtt, heparin gtt for concern of
PE. LENI at OSH of swollen LLE neg for DVT. BP dropped from
126/65 to 71/37 with the nitro, which resolved when the drip as
stopped. He was intubated at noon after not tolerating CPAP, and
becoming tachypneic on NRB. Here, he was noted to have
anisocoria not previous noted. Head CT showed no bleed, no
shift. CXR showed widened mediastinum, so he had a CTA. This
revealed bilateral PEs as well as an apical ptx. He was
restarted on the heparin gtt and a chest tube was placed. Pt
admitted to MICU for stabilization. Pt was extubated on [**5-13**].

Pertinent Results:
CTA of chest: CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE CHEST: Multiple pulmonary
emboli are seen; in the proximal portion of the right pulmonary
artery posterior branch near the bifurcation, extending into the
superior segment of the lower lobe. A smaller amount of clot is
seen in the pulmonary artery feeding the right middle lobe
medial segment. On the left, clot is seen in the pulmonary
artery feeding the posterior left upper lobe, and also in the
segment feeding the anteromedial left lower lobe. The aorta is
normal in caliber, with wall calcifications. No dissection is
seen. There are calcifications within the coronary arteries. No
pericardial effusion is present.

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: A small
pneumothorax is seen on the left; additionally, there is a small
amount of mediastinal air along the left superior mediastinal
border, into the apex of the lung. Dependent atelectasis is seen
on both sides; additionally, a peripheral portion of
consolidation in the right lower lobe superior segment is distal
to the portion of largest clot, and may represent developing
pulmonary infarction. There are shotty mediastinal lymph nodes.

A nasogastric tube is seen coiling in the stomach. The patient
is intubated. The imaged portions of the abdomen, including the
superior aspect of the spleen and liver, are unremarkable. A
nasogastric tube is seen in the esophagus, which is mildly
thickened; some debris and air bubbles within it, without
obvious tear.

Osseous structures are remarkable for degenerative changes of
the spine. There is an old healed rib fracture of the anterior
aspect of right rib number seven. A small amount of air seen in
the subclavian vein on the left, probably due to phlebotomy.

Coronal and sagittal reformations were essential in delineating
the anatomy and pathology. MPR value 4.

IMPRESSION:

1. Segmental pulmonary emboli in bilateral pulmonary arteries.
Associated peripheral consolidation in the right lower lobe,
concerning for infarct vs consolidation.

2. Small left pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum in intubated
patient.

3. Nasogastric tube in mildly thickened esophagus, with debris
and small amount of air, but no obvious tear.

4. Aortic calcifications, without evidence of dissection or
dilatation.
.
.
ECHO: Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably normal
(LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic function  is normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic  valve stenosis. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid  valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2191-5-11**] 1:21 PM

No intracranial hemorrhage. Diffuse chronic changes. There
appears to be interval marked atrophic change since [**2185**] which
could represent an accelerated degenerative process.
Additionally, there is marked interval enlargement of the
ventricles which may in part represent hydrocephalus (partly
related to atrophy) - there is hypo-attenuation of the
periventricular white matter which may represent chronic
ischemic changes or trans-ependymal edema. Further evaluation
with MRI might be helpful if clinically indicated.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
.
1. PE/DVT: Pt presented with resp failure and hypotension. Found
to have PE on CTA and subsequently found to have L leg DVT. Wife
reports that patient is very sedentary at home and only gets up
with assitance which may be once per day. In addition, he was on
Megase which can be prothrombotic. The patient was intubated in
the ED for ventilation and started on heparing gtt. The patient
was extubated within 48 hours and his respiratory status
continued to improve. On transfer from the MICU the patient had
an O2 sat of 95% on RA. IVC filter was considered for
prophylaxis, however it was felt that coumadin would be a better
long term management of his DVT and PE. The risk of fall was
considered, however the patient will be going to rehab and
likely a longterm care facility and would be able to ambulate
with assistance.

The patient was GUIAC neg which was checked prior to initiating
heparin. The patient was transitioned to Lovenox 50mg [**Hospital1 **] during
a bridge to a therapeutic INR. Goal INR is [*
