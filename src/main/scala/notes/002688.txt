Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 473**]
Chief Complaint:
pancreatic cancer


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2136-6-28**] - Retroperitoneal lymph node biopsies, exploratory
laparotomy, open cholecystectomy


History of Present Illness:
This 71-year-old man with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease presents with pancreatic cancer that is borderline
resectable. He was prepared by a Pulmonology consult deemed to
be an acceptable but high risk for pancreatic resection and he
opted to proceed. He was electively brought to the operating
room for a planned Whipple procedure, but intra-operatively it
was noted that serosal implants existed beyond the nodal disease
which rendered this stage IV pancreatic cancer and the operation
was aborted. Retroperitoneal lymph node biopsies, exploratory
laparotomy and open cholecystectomy was performed.


Past Medical History:
PMH: COPD, on home oxygen 2L continuously; Anxiety; Depression;
OSA; Hx of ARF; DMII, HTN, CAD s/p PTCA [**35**] yrs BU, ?seizures vs.
syncope

PSH: open appendectomy, tonsillectomy, bilateral carotid stents


Social History:
Patient retired (used to work for oxygen device company) and
lives with his mother in [**Name (NI) 7740**]. Has 5 children. Previously

years, now 0.75 pack per day. Patient states he quit alcohol 30
years ago. Prior crack/cocaine x 2 yrs. Quit a few yrs ago.

[**2136-7-2**] CHEST (PA & LAT): Right basal opacity most consistent
with atelectasis. No evidence of pneumothorax is present.
Increased bilateral lung lucency most likely reflects emphysema

[**2136-7-2**] CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: status-post CCY, with a
moderate amount of free intermediate density fluid in the
perihepatic region and gallbladder fossa, extending to the
inferior margin of the liver. No rim enhancement. Small amount
of pneumoperitoneum, relates to the recent surgery. Biliary
stent in place, with minimal pneumobilia, without biliary
dilation. Stable pancreatic ductal dilation, secondary to known
pancreatic mass. Mild narrowing of the SMV, just proximal to the
confluence. Bilateral trace pleural effusions with basal
atelectasis. Small amount of simple pelvic free fluid. No
retroperitoneal air to suggest duodenal perforation.


Brief Hospital Course:
NEURO/PAIN: The patient was maintained on IV pain medication in
the immediate post-operative period and transitioned to PO
narcotic medication with adequate pain control on POD#3. The
patient had some mental status changes in the post-operative
period, which was attributed to his medications versus acute
post-op delirium changes. He had serial neurologic exams. His
medication list was optimized to avoid anticholingeric or
delirium-inducing medications. It appeared that his home Xanax
was discontinued on admission and when resumed his mental status
improved. The patient remained alert and oriented to person and
place, but not always date/time.

CARDIOVASCULAR: The patient remained hemodynamically stable
intra-op and in the immediate post-operative period. He did
experience some episodic hypotension post-op requiring
re-intubation and fluid resuscitation. Their vitals signs were
closely monitored with telemetry. The patient's home
anti-hypertensive medications were resumed on POD#[**4-13**] once his
pressures responded to fluids. His home dose of Plavix was
restarted on POD#5, and his aspirin was continued immediately
post-op. A right-sided central venous catheter was placed pre-op
and removed on POD#5 when he was deemed hemodynamically stable.

RESPIRATORY: The patient was extubated in the immediate post-op
period successfully.
His ABG revealed evidence of hypercarbia and carbon dioxide
retention post-op and he required re-intubation on POD#0. The
patient had no episodes of desaturation or pulmonary concerns
following being extubated after this pulmonary episode. The
patient denied cough or respiratory symptoms following this, and
was maintained on nebulizers and pulmonary treatments.
Pulmonology was consulted pre-op for clearance, and they
continued following post-op, and they recommended continuing his
MDIs. Pulse oximetry was monitored closely and the patient
maintained adequate oxygenation. He had a CXR on POD#5 which
showed some right lower lobe atelectasis, but otherwise was
reassuring.

GASTROINTESTINAL: The patient was NPO following their procedure
and maintained on IV fluids for hydration while NPO. Serial
abdominal exams were performed, and once flatus resumed, the
patient was transitioned to a clear liquid diet and their IV
fluids were hep-locked on POD#[**4-13**]. The patient experienced no
nausea or vomiting. A regular diet was initiated on POD#[**6-15**] and
the patient tolerated this well. There was some concern on POD#4
that the patient was clinical worsening. His WBC was elevated to
21, he spiked low grade temperatures and had new-onset
tachycardiac (with stable EKG findings) which raised the concern
for anastomotic leak or intra-abdominal bleeding. On POD#4, an
upright abdominal X-ray revealed no free air and a CT of the
abdomen and pelvis showed only a simple peri-hepatic fluid
collection with post-operative changes and no extravasation of
contrast or perforation. He was empirically placed on IV
Vancomycin and Zosyn with improvement. He was closely monitored
with serial abdominal exams, which were reassuring.

GENITOURINARY: The patient's urine output was closely monitored
in the immediate post-operative period. A Foley catheter was
placed intra-operatively and removed on POD#2, at which time the
patient was able to successfully void without issue. On POD#4 a
Foley catheter was replaced for some low urine output and the
need for monitoring given the previous concerns for anastomotic
leak or bleeding. The patient's intake and output was closely
monitored for urine output > 30 mL per hour output. The Foley
was successfully removed again on POD#8. The patient's
creatinine was stable.

HEME: The patient's post-op hematocrit was stable and trended
closely. The patient remained hemodynamically stable and did not
require transfusion. The patient's coagulation profile remained
normal. The patient had no evidence of bleeding from their
incision.

ID: Their white count was 21 post-operatively (POD#4) and their
incision was closely monitored for any evidence of infection or
erythema. The patient initially only received standard
peri-operative antibiotics, but was started on empiric IV
Vancomycin and Zosyn on the evening of POD#4 given concerns for
anastomotic leak or infection. Blood and urine cultures were
obtained for low grade temperatures. He clinically improved with
IV antibiotics and his fevers resolved. Blood cultures revealed
[**3-16**] bottle positive for gram negative rods which speciated
E.coli that was pan-sensitive. He was continued on IV Zosyn and
transitioned to PO-Cipro for a 2-week course, which he will
complete on di
