History of Present Illness:
This is a 74 YOM with significant medical history of
cholangiocarcinoma, severe pneumonia, aspiration requiring PEG
tube, and anemia who presents from rehab after episode of
melena.He has been at rehab for several days and doing well with
PT. His respiratory status was back to baseline. Today he had a
sudden on set of lower abdominal pain, [**7-7**], sharp without
radiation. Patient states that it lasted ~30m and ended when he
passed out from the pain. No pain sense that time. Had melena
per rehab report, patient states he knows he had BM around the
time of the pain but did not see it.
In the ED, initial vitals were T97.1 HR 105 BP 104/49 RR20 93%
on 2L. He was given IV pantoprazole, 2L of NS and 2 units of
pRBCs. Remained normotensive and tachycardic. Lavage done via
PEG tube with no return of blood or coffe ground material.
Attempted NG lavage but unable to pass tube.

age of 10, he smoked 2 packs per day until he quit 4 years ago.
He has over 120-pack-year history. He drank
alcohol approximately [**1-30**] beverages a day prior to his
hospitalization, in the past had drank more than that.No alcohol
in more than 30 days.

________________________________________________________________
CXR at admission
There is improved aeration in the right lower lung. Linear
opacities persist, likely in part atelectasis versus resolving
airspace disease. There is a persistent right pleural effusion
blunting the right costophrenic angle which may have slightly
decreased in size as well. There is no volume overload. No
discrete visceral pleural line is seen to suggest pneumothorax.
The left lung is hyperexpanded but otherwise unremarkable. There
is a minimal tortuosity to an atherosclerotic aorta. The cardiac
silhouette is within normal limits for size. A tube of
indeterminate origin or etiology is seen overlying the included
abdomen. There is a high attenuation focus projecting within the
lateral right upper lung which is clearly extrapulmonary when
compared to prior studies. This is likely within the axillary
soft tissues.
.
CXR [**2158-4-24**]
Severe pulmonary edema is new.  Consolidation at the right lung
base is
partially obscured but probably unchanged.  Heart size normal.
Pulmonary
artery dilatation reflecting pulmonary hypertension due to
longstanding
chronic lung disease, unchanged.  ET tube in standard placement.
 No
pneumothorax.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**2158-4-23**]
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Degree of consolidation in
both lower lobes appears to have progressed slightly. There are
superimposed interstitial densities compatible with fibrosis at
the lung bases. There is an unchanged rim-enhancing pleural
fluid collection in the right lung base. There is new filling of
the prior lumen of the common bile duct and intrahepatic ducts
with high-density material which has the Hounsfield units
(60-70) of acute blood clot. The gallbladder is abnormal in
appearance with heterogeneous areas of high density, also likely
indicating hematoma/blood clot. In some images (series 2, image
35), there is a suggestion that there is hemorrhage both in the
lumen and in the gallbladder wall. There is worsening
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. There is redemonstration
of the large mass in the junctions of segments VII and VIII
which is not changed in size or appearance. Located anteriorly
and just slightly inferior to the largest portion of the lesion,
there is a new 6-mm tubular collection of arterial phase
contrast seen adjacent to a branching vessel from the right
hepatic artery (which is replaced, arising from the SMA). On
reconstructed images, this appears to be more tubular in shape.
No delay-phase images were acquired. There is also a
heterogeneous area of slightly increased attenuation in the
liver parenchyma near the porta hepatis. The portal vein is
small but remains patent, along with the SMV and likely splenic
vein. A gastrojejunostomy tube is present. There is mild
dilatation of the pancreatic duct measuring up to 4 mm. The
common bile duct is massively dilated, measuring up to 2.6 cm.
At a similar level on [**4-6**], the duct measured 13 mm. There is
no ascites. Multiple splenules are present. The adrenal glands,
kidneys, and bowel loops are unremarkable.
.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Scattered air-fluid levels
are present in the colon. There is no colonic wall thickening.
There is no free fluid in the pelvis or blood in the pelvis.

.
[**2158-4-24**] ERCP - FINDINGS: Ten fluoroscopic images obtained during
ERCP procedure were submitted to be evaluated by Radiology. No
radiologist was present during the procedure. The scout image
demonstrates surgical clips in the right upper quadrant.
Cannulation and opacification of the biliary duct is noted.
There is marked dilation of the CBD with a large filling defect
may represent blood. There is partial opacification of the
pancreatic duct with borderline diffuse dilatation. A double
pigtail biliary stent was placed.

IMPRESSION: Successful ERCP with placement of a double pigtail
biliary stent.
.
[**4-23**] Hepatic artery embolization - 1. Selective and
superselective arteriograms through the superior mesenteric
artery and the replaced right hepatic artery showed the
suspected pseudoaneurysm coming off a cranial branch of the
right hepatic artery, without active extravasation of contrast.

2. Successful flow-directed embolization of the branches
supplying the pseudoaneurysm with multiple straight coils and
Gelfoam slurry, until stasis was achieved.

3. Follow-up angiogram demonstrates good angiographic results
with stasis at the level of the branches supplying the
pseudoaneurysm and no more opacification of the pseudoaneurysm.
