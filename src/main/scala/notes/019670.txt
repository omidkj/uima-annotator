arteries.  The left AT was patent.  The left peroneal was
patent but a small artery.  The dorsalis pedis was patent.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Blood pressure 162/70,
temperature 96.9??????, pulse 80, respirations 16, oxygen
saturation 94% on room air.  General:  The patient was a
white female in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Unremarkable.
Neck:  Carotids palpable without bruits.  Pulse:  Exam showed
palpable radials and femorals bilaterally.  Popliteals absent
bilaterally.  The pedal pulses were with Dopplerable signals
of the dorsalis pedis artery bilaterally, and the posterior
tibials were absent by Doppler signal and palpation.  There
were no femoral bruits.  Chest:  Lungs clear to auscultation.
Heart:  Irregularly irregular.  Abdomen:  Unremarkable.
Rectal:  Exam deferred.  The right groin was without
bleeding, ecchymosis, or hematoma.  The left foot was cooler
than the right.  There were no ulcerations.  She had
venostasis changes of the lower extremities bilaterally.
Neurological:  Unremarkable.

LABORATORY DATA:  Preoperative labs included a CBC with a
white count of 8.2, hematocrit 46.5, platelet count 187, BUN
27, creatinine 1.2; potassium 5.2; PT, INR, PTTs were normal;
urinalysis was unremarkable.

Chest x-ray showed no active cardiopulmonary disease.
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with left axis
deviation.  No acute ST-T changes or Q-waves.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
preoperative holding area.  On [**2153-10-18**], she underwent
a left femoral to anterior tibial bypass with nonreversed
................ saphenous vein and angioscopy with valve
lysis.  She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
to the PACU in stable condition.  The patient required
Nitroglycerin intraoperatively, but on postoperative check,
the Nitroglycerin was off.  Urine output as down.  She was
bolused with fluids.  Vitals signs were stable.  CVP 11, PAD
20, wedge 19, SVR [**2065**].  Postoperative hematocrit was 33.7,
BUN 20, creatinine 1.0; potassium 4.3; coags with INR of 2.1,
PTT 180.  Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation
without acute changes.  Chest x-ray was unremarkable, and
there was no pneumothorax.

On postoperative day #1, there were no overnight events.  The
hematocrit was 32.5 and stable.  The patient required
Nitroglycerin of 3.3 mg/kg/min for afterload reduction.
Systolic blood pressure was 142/58, CVP 10, PAP 43/19, index
2.01, SVR 1594.  The JP drained a total of 210 cc.  BUN and
creatinine remained stable.  Coags with an INR of 1.5, PTT
31.3.  The patient remained on bedrest.  Her diet was
advanced as tolerated.  She received a fluid bolus of 250 cc
normal saline for lower urinary output.  She was begun on her
preoperative medications.

On postoperative day #2, the patient remained on the unit on
Nitroglycerin at 1 mg/kg/min.  The patient remained
hemodynamically stable.  PA pressures remained 55/19, with a
CVP of 5, index 2.4.  Hematocrit was 26, down from 32.9.  PT
and INR were unremarkable.  BUN and creatinine remained
stable.  Potassium was 3.8; this was supplemented.  The PA
catheter was discontinued.  The patient remained in the VICU
with leg wrap, and ambulation was begun.

On postoperative day #3, the patient had episodes of
bradycardia which resolved spontaneously without hemodynamic
changes.  T-max was 100.1??????, defervescing to 98.4??????.  She
remained in atrial fibrillation.  She had a systolic blood
pressure of 157/77.  Oxygen saturation was 99% on 3 L.  The
patient diurese 1874 cc over the last 24 hours.  Her exam was
unremarkable.  Wounds were clean, dry, and intact.  The
extremities warm with Dopplerable dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial.  Ambulation was begun.  Telemetry was
discontinued.  Arterial line was discontinued.  The patient
was transferred to the regular nursing floor.

Physical Therapy was requested to see the patient and assess
for discharge planning.  Physical Therapy felt that the
patient would benefit from a short rehabilitation stay to
increase endurance and functional mobility.  Case Management
discussed with the patient facilities of interest.  [**Hospital3 1761**] was mentioned, and screening was begun.

The remaining hospital course was unremarkable.  The patient
was discharged in stable condition.  Wounds were clean, dry,
and intact.  The patient had a warm foot with a Dopplerable
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial.  The patient should
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] in two weeks.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Coumadin, the patient should resume
her preoperative dosing, Lopressor 75 mg b.i.d., Hydralazine
