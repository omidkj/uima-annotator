p.o. twice a day, Zantac 150 mg p.o. twice a day, albuterol
p.r.n., aspirin 325 mg p.o. once a day, Lipitor 10 mg p.o.
once a day.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  On exam, he was in no apparent distress.
Blood pressure 150/80, sinus rhythm 88. His HEENT exam was
within normal limits. His neck was supple. His chest was
clear bilaterally. His heart was regular rate and rhythm with
S1 and S2 present. His abdomen was soft, and he had 2+ radial
and femoral pulses.

Re[**Last Name (STitle) **]ardiac catheterization showed left anterior
descending 80% lesion, circumflex 80% lesion, and 100%
proximal RCA lesion. He was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for
coronary artery bypass grafting and a question mitral valve
repair.

LABORATORIES:  Preop labs are as follows: White count 7.5,
hematocrit 39.5, platelet count 200,000. Sodium 140, K 4.3,
chloride 102, bicarbonate 31, BUN 27, creatinine 1.6 with a
blood sugar of 91. ALT 59, AST 23, LDH 143, alkaline
phosphatase 74, total bilirubin 0.3, albumin 4.3, hba1c 6.0%.
Urinalysis was negative for bacteria, but positive for blood
and trace protein.

Preop chest x-ray showed acute cardiopulmonary process.

HO[**Last Name (STitle) **] COURSE:  The following morning on [**2118-6-6**], the
patient underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting x1
with a LIMA to the LAD by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]. He was taken to
the cardiothoracic ICU in stable condition on a Neo-
Synephrine drip at 0.4 mcg per kilograms per minute, a
nitroglycerin drip at 0.3 mcg per kilograms per minute, and a
propofol titrated drip.

Patient was extubated later that evening and remained in
sinus rhythm. On postoperative day 1, he was on an insulin
drip at 1.0 and a nitroglycerin at 0.5. Maintained good blood
pressure 109/59, heart rate 70 in sinus rhythm. Postop labs
as follows: White count 9.7, hematocrit 26.4, platelet count
134,000. INR of 1.0. K 4.0, BUN 17, creatinine 1.0. The plan
per [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was that the patient would probably receive
stent prior to discharge or perhaps in some point in the
postoperative period as a hybrid procedure for his off-pump
CABG x1.

On postoperative day 2, he had elevated blood pressure. His
Lopressor was increased. He was saturating 98% on 2 liters
nasal cannula. His labs remained stable, and his chest tubes
were removed.

On postoperative day 3, patient was started on Ativan for
agitation with a plan for stenting on Friday.
Postoperatively, creatinine remained stable at 1.3, and the
patient continued to make good progress. He remained on a
nitroglycerin drip at 1.25 mcg per kilogram per minute on
postoperative day 3. Patient did have some psychiatric issues
and had a one-to-one sitter provided as per confusion. There
was a question as to whether or not the patient was having
alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Patient also been restarted on
Plavix in the postoperative period. On the 14th, his mental
status started to clear, although he still required a sitter.
He was straight catheterized x1 for urgency and difficulty
generating a urinary stream. His nitroglycerin was ultimately
weaned off, and he was transferred out to the floor.

On postoperative day 4, he did remain NPO with a nonfocal
exam. His exam was otherwise unremarkable. His creatinine
continued to come down to 1.1. His white count remained
stable at 8.2. His beta-blockade was increased to 100 of
Lopressor twice a day. His blood pressure remained stable at
147/74. He did have a sitter one-to-one for him on his 1st
day on the floor. Decision was made that the patient would
not get stents during this admission, and the plan was to
have him get stents postoperatively as an outpatient and
follow up with cardiology.

On postoperative day 5, he was in sinus rhythm with a heart
rate of 84 and a blood pressure of 165/85, and he continued
to progress on the floor. He was seen and evaluated with the
nurses and physical therapist to increase his activity level
and tolerance.

On postoperative day 6, he was recatheterized for retention
of urine with a request for urology consult. The following
morning his discharge was held at that time. His exam was
otherwise unremarkable. His pacing wires were pulled.

On postoperative day 7, he was unable to fully void and the
Foley was replaced. He was otherwise doing well. The plan was
replacing the Foley and discharge the patient for followup
with urologist in 1 week. Patient was also started on Flomax
0.4 mg p.o. once daily. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], [**MD Number(3) 61832**] with the
son and will set up the appointment with the patient's
urologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] as an outpatient.

On the day of discharge, the patient's exam was unremarkable.
Blood pressure 132/75, saturating 98% on room air,
respiratory rate 20, heart rate sinus rhythm [**Company 61833**]. max
99.9.

FOLLOW UP:  He was discharged to home with the following
recommendations for followup: Patient to see Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1295**], his cardiologist 2-3 weeks postdischarge. To see
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8049**], his primary care physician 2-3 weeks
postdischarge. Follow up with [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], his surgeon in [**1-28**]
weeks postop for his postop surgical visit, and to see Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], his urologist on Friday, [**6-17**] at 11:45 a.m.
