None.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 33976**] is a 43 yo female with HTN, COPD, OSA, alcohol abuse
who presented to PCP's office yesterday with
lightheadedness/fatigue. She reported she had been taking her BP
at home and was getting readings in the 70s and 80s. She
reported concentrated urine and thirst. She reports she reduced
her toprol and lisinopril dose in the last month due to low BPs.
She denies poor PO intake and denies worsening alcohol abuse,
last drink was 1 week ago (has an abuse history).  She denies
fevers, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, SOB,
productive cough.  She has a history of chronic diarrhea which
is unchanged.
.
In the ED, vitals were BP 104/59, HR 91, RR 16, 99% on RA. She
was complaining of flank pain so got a renal ultrasound which
was negative. Her UA was also negative. Her BP fell to 79/39, so
she was given 3L of IVF and her BP improved. She was admitted to
MICU for BP monitoring.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 43 year-old female with HTN, COPD, anxiety/depression, alcohol
abuse, who was admitted after being referred to the ED by her
PCP for acute renal failure, was found to have hypotension,
likely due to dehdration and med effect and ARF, requiring a
short MICU stay.
.
# Hypotension: this was likely due to recurrence of chronic
diarrhea and ongoing alcohol use.  Might also be due to
antihypertensives.  There was no evidence of infection to
suggest sepsis and no evidence of EKG changes to suggest a
cardiac element.  There was mild leukocytosis that resolved with
IVF.  Of note, patient had similar admission in [**4-5**].  Her BP
improved rapidly on fluid resuscitation with SBP back up to the
100s; her creatinine also trended towards baseline.  Her
antihypertensives and diurectics were held.  She was was
mentating well throughout.
.
She was transferred to the floors after one night in MICU.  On
the floors, her blood pressure was measured and although she was
slightly orthostatic, her dizziness quickly resolved (with in
seconds) after standing.  She was tolerating pos fine and had no
further diarrhea and no vomiting.  We believe that her
orthostatic hypotension is multifactorial.  It is likely that
prior to admission she was drinking alcohol (perhaps
excessively-- not clear but her serum EtOH level at admission
was 36).  She was also likely dehydrated from diarrhea during
the week leading up to admission.  Lastly, the
antihypertensives, Seroquel (which is known to cause orthostatic
hypotension), and Trazadone may be contributing to her
orthostatic symptoms.  At time of discharge, we have decreased
the dose of her Trazadone and stopped her anti-hypertensives,
including her BB, ACEI, and spironolactone.  She will follow-up
with her primary provider next week and has been instructed to
measure her BP daily, and to report SBP <90 or >150 to her
doctor.
.
# ARF: Likely pre-renal ARF in setting of hypotension. Her
creatinine trended down with fluid resuscitation. Medications
were renally dosed.
.
# Leukcytosis:  Mild leukocytosis with unremarkable differetial,
likely reactive leukocytosis. Trended down with IVF.
.
# COPD: was continued on albuterol, Atrovent, Advair.
.
# Alcohol abuse: Last drink 1 week ago, though has history of
minimizing alcohol abuse. She was put on CIWA scale and started
on multivitamin, thiamine, folate.  There were no withdrawal
symptoms.
.
# Psych. History of anxiety, depression. Was continued on
citalopram, Seroquel, Risperdal.  Trazadone dose decreased as
above.  Could consider decreasing Seroquel as outpatient if
orthostatic symptoms persist.
.
# Tobacco abuse: was put on nicotine patch and couseled about
smoking cessation.  Agreed to continue nicotine patch after
discharge.
.
# OSA: CPAP, autoset mask
