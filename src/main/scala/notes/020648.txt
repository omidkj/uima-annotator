Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 yo female with long-standing coronary disease s/p
CABG in [**2143**] and redo in [**2156**] who presented with chest pain
refractory to nitroglycerin who was admitted to CCU for concern
for STEMI.  She began experiencing left-sided non-radiating [**8-19**]
chest pain last night, for which she took 325mg aspirin and 9
sublingual nitroglycerins  with minimal relief.  She then called
EMS, who administered another sublingual nitroglycerin which
also did not provide substantial relief.  She was brought to the
emergency room where she was noted to have ST segment deviations
in V1-V2.  Cardiac catheterization was discussed and patient
declined due to presence of non-intervenable disease on prior
catheterizations and she opted for medical management.  She was
continued on home clopidogrel 75mg, and given a heparin bolus,
and admitted to CCU for further evaluation and management.  She
also received morphine 4mg IV and hydromorphone IV which
rendered her pain free.  Eptifibatide was deferred on admission
due to renal insufficiency.  Of note, patient was also noted to
be guaiac positive in the emergency room.
.
Of note, patient was admitted to the hospital during [**Month (only) 1096**]
[**2170**] with CHF exacerbations and cellulitis.  She had been sent
home on torsemide and metolazone and was changed back to
furosemide on [**2170-2-10**] since her weight had come down to 176
lbs.  She reports that her weight has been stable since then and
she denies any worsening dyspnea or worsening oedema.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for orthopnea, increasing
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

PICC placement - IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated ultrasound and
fluoroscopically guided 4Fr PICC line placement via the right
brachial venous approach. Final internal length is 33 cm, with
the tip positioned in SVC. The line is ready to use.
.
EKG [**2171-2-18**] - Atrial fibrillation. There are small R waves in the
anterior leads consistent with probable prior anterior
myocardial infarction. Diffuse ST-T wave changes which are
non-specific but may represent ischemia or infarction. Low
voltage in the precordial leads. Compared to the previous
tracing the rate is slightly slower.
.
Chest x-ray - FINDINGS: A single AP semi-upright view of the
chest was obtained. The patient is status post median sternotomy
with median sternotomy wires identified. The heart is stably
enlarged. There is atherosclerotic disease of the aorta. The
lungs are clear bilaterally. There are no pleural effusions or
pneumothorax identified. The osseous structures are intact.
IMPRESSION: Marked stable cardiomegaly with clear lungs.
.
Echo - The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
moderately enlarged. The estimated right atrial pressure is
0-10mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the
anterior septum and anterior walls. The apex is mildly
dyskinetic. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
40%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber size is moderately increased with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate to severe aortic valve
stenosis (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric,
inferolaterally directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Right ventricular cavity
enlargement with free wall hypokinesis. Moderate aortic valve
stenosis. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Moderate mitral regurgitation.
