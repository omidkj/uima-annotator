Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Toprol XL

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 896**]
Chief Complaint:
Bright red blood per rectum.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- Mesenteric angiograhphy with embolization ([**2151-7-19**])
- Capsule endoscopy

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 88 y/o female with a history o AVR on
coumadin, atrial fibrillation who was recently hospitalization
([**Date range (1) 89158**]) for melena & subsequently found to have colonic
adenomas and diverticula but no obvious source of bleeding, who
now returns with BRBPR, anemia, & hypotension.

On [**7-1**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted by her PCP after she
experienced 7 days of melena and had a positive hemoccult test
in office.  During that admission, EGD was negative, and
colonoscopy revealed multiple polyps and diverticula, but no
active source of bleeding.  Pathology of the polyps was
consistent with adenoma.  Hct dropped from 32.3 to 24.2 during
that admission, but remained stable thereafter; the patient was
hemodynamically stable.  Her coumadin was initialy held; she was
eventually  restarted on coumadin with a heparin bridge.

Ms. [**Known lastname **] had been doing well since discharge, until the day of
admission when she had 3 episodes of BRBPR.  She saw her PCP for
[**Name9 (PRE) 1944**] [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] on [**7-15**], at which time her H/H was
8.9/26.5 and Cr 1.08.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 96.8 BP 70/33 R 17.  Patient was
asymptomatic with no CP, SOB, N/V, or dizziness.  She had a
bowel movement in the ED which was brow mixed with bright red
blood.  Labs were significant for Hct 24.1, INR 3.1, BUN 32 and
Cr 1.3.  She was started on a pantoprazole drip and given
vitamin K 10mg IV.  GI was consulted and recommended reversal of
anticoagulation and CTA vs colonoscopy in AM.  Surgery consulted
as well in case of urgent need to control of bleeding, but the
patient declined potential surgical interventions.

Imaging:
CXR ([**7-19**]):
AP UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is severe cardiomegaly.
There is no
overt edema. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There
is no focal consolidation. There has been prior median
sternotomy and CABG. The
uppermost sternal wire is discontinuous.
IMPRESSION: Severe cardiomegaly without overt edema.

CT abdomen and pelvis ([**7-19**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Lower GI bleed in the ascending colon with active arterial
extravasation and intraluminal accumulation of intravenous
contrast.
2. Diffuse atherosclerotic disease. There is approximately 50%
narrowing of the origin and proximal celiac artery with
post-stenotic dilation. The celiac axis, SMA, bilateral single
renal arteries and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] are patent.
3. Peripheral branches of the portal vein are thrombosed in
segments V and II. Imaging findings are suggestive of chronic
thrombus.
4. Subcentimeter hypodense lesions in the right hepatic lobe are
too small to accurately characterize.

Mesenteric angiography ([**7-19**]):
FINDINGS:
1. SMA angiogram demonstrated contrast extravasation in the
region of the
cecum and proximal ascending colon. Subsequent subselective
ileocolic and
third-order branch angiograms confirmed the above finding.
Visualization of likely early filling of venous structures in
the region of contrast
extravasation.
2. Successful coil embolization for bleeding from the right
colon, which was likely as a result of angiodysplasia in the
cecum/proximal ascending colon related to third- order branch of
superior mesenteric artery.
IMPRESSION: Successful coil embolization of extravasation in the

cecum/proximal ascending colon.

CXR ([**7-21**]):
ONE VIEW OF THE CHEST:
The lungs are well expanded and show mild interstitial
opacities. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The mediastinal
silhouette and hilar contours are normal. There may be a small
left pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION:
Cardiomegaly with mild edema.

CXR ([**7-21**]):
FINDINGS: Tip of the left PICC line is seen in the SVC. Post
CABG with intact sternotomy sutures. The cardiomegaly is
unchanged. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, slightly
worse since prior radiograph. Otherwise there are no other
relevant interval changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
88 y/o female with mechanical AVR on coumadin, atrial
fibrillation, &  recent hospitalization ([**Date range (1) 89158**]) for melena
presents with bright red blood per rectum and hypotension.
.
ACUTE DIAGNOSES:
# Bright Red Blood Per Rectum: Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a significant
lower GI bleed, complicated by prior anticoaguliation, requiring
a total of 11 units pRBCs transfusion.  CT angiogram showed a
clear bleeding source in the right colon and she was sent to IR
for embolization of this vessel.  Due to the appearance of this
vessel, it was felt that this was most likely an angiodysplastic
lesion, which is consistent with the association of aortic
stenosis and angiodysplasia.  The surgical service felt that a
right hemicolectomy may be beneficial to her to eliminate this
site of a potential re-bleed, but the patient ultimately
declined surgery, after deciding the risks of the surgery itself
given her comorbidities as well as the possibility of other
angioplastic lesions elsewhere in the colon that could bleed
also outweighed the potential benefits of removing the culprit
lesion.  In order to rule out any other source of bleeding, the
GI service elected to pursue a capsule endoscopy when the
patient stabilized which showed a non-bleeding jejunal erosion.
She was monitored in the ICU while she was restarted on a
heparin drip, in anticipation of a bridge back to outpatient
anticoagulation.  Given her stability with Hct >30, she was
transferred to the gen
