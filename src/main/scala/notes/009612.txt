Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH for cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization
Intra-aortic balloon pump
hemodialysis
Pulmonary Artery catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
This is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension,
diabetes, CRI and moderate aortic stenosis who was seen in his
cardiologists office on [**9-23**] with complaints of shortness of
breath and chest discomfort. He actually reports that the
shortness of breath and chest pain had started approx 1 week
prior to this but since he had a pcp appt soon, he decided not
to go to the Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] pain is described as substernal pressure
that would occur at rest and wake him from sleep. It radiated to
his left arm and is very similar to previous MI. It would
improve on its own and was intermittent over the last week.
.
OSH course:
He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1474**] ED where he was found to have
a heart rate in the 30-40's. On EKG he was found to be have a
high grade AV block. He was admitted to the unit and his heart
rate dropped to the 20's thought secondary to beta-blocker
toxicity. Beta blockers had been discontinued, but bradycardia
persisted with dyspnea. The patient ruled in for a NSTEMI and he
was referred for cardiac catheterization but refused as he also
has a history of CRI. His heart rate increased to the 60's and
he was transferred to the telemetry unit in a 2:1 block on
[**2184-9-27**]. He underwent implantation of a pacemaker on
[**2184-9-29**] and immediately post procedure developed shortness of
breath, chest discomfort and decreased his blood pressure. He
was bolused with fluid and started on a Neo drip which his is
currently on at 20 mcg. He had a triple lumen catheter in the
RIJ and was transferred to the CCU. He has been pain free but
very short of breath on a venti mask at 40% which they have been
unable to wean. He has received repeated doses of IV lasix with
little effect.
.
Patient has agreed to cardiac catheterization at this time.
Patient was given Lasix 40 mg at 7:30, 40 mg at 10:50, 120 mg
given at 1200, mucomust 300 mg po prior to transfer. Troponin
from 9 am today 30.4
.
Patient was transported directly to the cath lab. Where the RCA
and prox LAD was intervened upon with BMS. He was given
additional lasix, IABP was placed and the patient had
improvement in urine output. Dopamine was started with
tachycardia and thus was transitioned to dobutamine for low
cardiac output.
.
Currently he denies chest pain, has mild dyspnea, otherwise is
asymptomatic.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 yo M with history of CAD, HTN, bradycardia s/p pacemaker and
NSTEMI now s/p PCI with 2 BMS (LAD, RCA) and IABP placement.
.
#) Cardiogenic shock: On admission with low cardiac output and
index, thus started on dobutamine and IABP.  Swan placed on [**10-2**]
due to unclear etiology of shock.  Picture initially thought to
be consistent with cardiogenic shock with elevated filling
pressures.  Started on hydral for afterload reduction.  However
persistently hypotensive, and thus swan placed again on [**10-12**].
Hemodynamics at this time consistent with mixed picture with
increased filling pressures, but elevated cardiac output and
decreased SVR.  Due to persistent WBC and question of infiltrate
started on vanc, zosyn for nosocomial pneumonia and treated for
a 7 day course.  On [**10-16**], pt wished to go home with home
hospice.
.
#) CAD/NSTEMI:   Patient with severe 3VD and s/p 2 vessel
stenting.  Patient initially reticent to have intervention and
thus had prolonged ischemia/infarction.  Per cath report may
need further intervention in future of left circumflex.
Continued on aspirin, plavix, statin.  BB and ACE-i held due to
continued hypotension.
.
#) Hypoxia/Tachypnea: patient with persistent 02 requirement
likely secondary to volume overload.  Hemodynamics c/w
cardiogenic shock with elevated filling pressures.  Due to
oliguric acute renal failure, started on CVVHD.
.
#) Acute on chronic renal failure: Oliguric renal failure
secondary to poor perfusion.  Renal consulted.  CVVHD initiated.

.
------
After much discussion, patient opted to be made CMO.  He was
discharged to home with comort measures and hospice care.
Recommendations were as per the palliative care team who saw the
patient prior to discharge and discussed his care.  Prior to
discharge all invasive lines were removed except tunnelled
dialysis catheter which was deemed to invasive to remove with
causing the patient further discomfort.
