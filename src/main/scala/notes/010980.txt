Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2186-3-14**] for a
left femur osteotomy.  See operative note for details.  Her

the ICU for further management.  A CTA was done that was
negative.  Differential diagnosis was fat emboli versus acute
blood loss.  She was stabilized and extubated in the ICU and
transferred to the floor to the orthopedic service.  Her labs
and vital signs remained stable.  She was evaluated by physical
therapy and progressed well.  Her hospital course was otherwise
wihout incident.  She is being dicharged today in stable
