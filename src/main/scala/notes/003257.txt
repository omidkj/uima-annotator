HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 79-year-old female
with a past medical history significant for increased
cholesterol who presented to our hospital who presented for
several days of malaise, nausea, vomiting, weakness, and
dizziness.  The patient was OB+.  She had a Hartmann in her
40's and was found to be hypotensive.  She denies any chest
pain or shortness of breath.  Electrocardiogram showed [**Street Address(2) 11741**] depression in V2 and V4 and ST elevations in 2, 3, and AvF
as well as complete heart block.  The patient was started on
IV heparin and then became apneic and hypotensive in the
emergency room. This required intubation and administration
of dopamine.  She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization, but has now become hypotensive on admission
and still in complete heart block.  She had a left heart
catheterization which revealed 95% of left anterior
descending stenosis and 100% occluded left circumflex which
was stented.  She was also found to have a small RC not
supplying a large part of myocardium.  After this cardiac
catheterization, the patient has hypotension with an episode
of supraventricular tachycardia.  All of these stopped with
the initiation of intra-aortic balloon pump.  In addition on
doing cardiac catheterization, the saturations in the left
and right side of the heart suggested presence of
atrioventricular septal defect.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

ALLERGIES:  None.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is widowed and lives alone.  No smoking
or alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 98.7, heart rate of
105, blood pressure was 126/50.  Respiratory rate is 20,
oxygen saturation is 98.  The patient is intubated and was
generally nonreactive to stimuli.  Head, ears, eyes, nose and
throat: Pupils are small, but equal and reactive to light.
Mucus membranes are dry.  Neck:  Difficult to appreciate
jugular venous distention.  No lymphadenopathy is palpable.
Cardiovascular:  Tachycardic, obscured heart sounds.  Chest:
Good breath sounds bilaterally. Abdomen: Soft and nontender
and normal active bowel sounds. Extremities:  No edema.  Good
bilateral pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  Significant for CK of 159, MB of 15, index
of 10 and troponin of 1.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit for close observation monitoring. Immediately upon
admission, she had a TU which revealed anteroseptal defect.
The initial impression was to try to close this with a clam
shell procedure which is going to offer her best chances of
stabilizing a hemodynamics given that she became to be very
hypotensive.

However, discussion with the family, they decided that they
did not want any procedures done. The patient's blood
pressure remained extremely labile requiring a few pressors
in the beginning with fair satisfactory result.  Initial
subsequent echocardiogram revealed that she had global left
ventricular hypokinesis.  She was started on aspirin, Plavix
and maintained on IV heparin. She was also started on
Lipitor.  Initially, we could not start a beta-blocker given
her complete heart block and hypotension.  However, this
subsequently improved.  This was added to her regimen.  To
further improve her hemodynamics upon arrival to the CCU she
received large amounts of fluid and became about 15 liters
positive.  However, this increased preload and had
significant improvement in her hemodynamics and initially was
tolerated.  After while she became volume overloaded without
evidence of compromising her oxygenation.  This volume
overload was gradually improved with gentle diuresis and
sometimes with autodiuresis.  Once the condition improved,
she was started on Captopril which she tolerated a small
dose.  The balloon pump was stopped and had no significant
effect on her hemodynamics.

On hospital day #4 and #5, it became apparent that the
patient was aseptic which is the cause of her continued
hypotension.  She required pressors for about 10 consecutive
days, but eventually was able to be weaned off completely and
maintained good blood pressure.  In terms of rhythm, the
patient remained most of the time in first degree AV block
and notable in complete heart block with tachycardia in the
unit.  However, she did have one episode of atrial
fibrillation in the context of ventilatory weaning.  Because
of this, she was started on amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q. day.
She had no further episodes of atrial fibrillation.  She is
also being anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation and for low
ejection fraction with akinetic ventricle.

2. Infectious disease:  There were multiple consults
involving infectious disease.  The patient was probably
aspirated during episodes of nausea and vomiting in the
outside hospital and particularly given the findings on
x-ray.  Sputum showed multiple organisms including gram
positive cocci and gram negative rods, but none of these were
grown. She received a 14 day course of levofloxacin and
Flagyl with marked improvement in her symptoms.
Additionally, the patient had 2 out of 4 blood cultures
positive for staph.  Both local lines were stopped and she
received a 14 day course of IV vancomycin.  Upon discharge,
all of her infectious disease issues has been resolved and
she has no evidence of being infected at this point.

3.  Renal:  Upon admission, the patient may be in very mild
acidosis which could have an myocardial infarction. This
improved.  She was being diuresed while in the hospital
course. She had a mild increase of creatinine and this is
probably normal and to be expected.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient initially had very labile blood
sugars in the 300 to 500 range.  She required initiation of
IV insulin drip and this was continued for at least 4 days.
This patient was getting better and was changed to a standing
NPH insulin.  It is quite likely that she has unrecognized
underlying diabetes mellitus that has not been treated. She
will probably require further follow up for this condition.

5.  Pulmonary:  The patient was initially intubated for
protection.  She had a very prolonged and complicated course
including inability to wean over a week, pneumonia and fluid
overload.   On hospital day #10, the final attempts to
extubate the patient was successful and she remained very
stable from respiratory standpoint and positioned to room air
shortly thereafter.  She has no acquired pneumonia and was
able to breathe comfortably on room air at this point.

6.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient had some episodes of
bleeding from the oropharyngeal tract, but this is believed
more to be due to injury from the TE and intubation rather
than any gastrointestinal bleed.   Consultation of ENT was
obtained.  There is no continued gastrointestinal bleeding
from the gastrointestinal tract.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Plavix 75 p.o. q. day indefinitely.
2. Aspirin 325 p.o. indefinitely.
3. Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q. day to be switched to 200 mg
p.o. q. day in about 3 to 4 weeks.
4. Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q. day.
5. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q. day, this may need to be readjusted
for proper INR.
6. NPH 60 units in the morning, 10 units at night.
7. Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Acute myocardial infarction.
2. Status post catheterization.
3. Diabetes mellitus.
4. Atrial fibrillation.
5. Sepsis.
6. Aspiration pneumonia.
