Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Shortness of breath

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Sternal wound infection/mediastinitis

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old female
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] on [**2109-8-5**] who was transferred
from [**Hospital6 3872**].  She was admitted there for
hypercarbic respiratory failure and intubated secondary to
CO2 retention when given oxygen at the outside hospital.  She
was subsequently sent to their Intensive Care Unit and
extubated, at which point she was found to have an infection
of her sternotomy wound.  She was placed on vancomycin
Proteus sensitive to the vancomycin.  She was also in mild
renal failure during her hospitalization which was resolving
upon transfer.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft x4
2.  Hypertension
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
4.  Status post knee replacement
5.  Aortic stenosis
6.  Hiatal hernia
7.  Depression
8.  Status post cholecystectomy
9.  Status post appendectomy
10. Status post carpal tunnel release surgery

ALLERGIES:  She had no known drug allergies.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  K-Dur 20 milliequivalents p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7.  Atrovent and albuterol metered dose inhaler 2 puffs 4x
per day

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Significant for ex-smoker who stopped seven
years ago.  She had a 60 pack year history of smoking.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:
VITAL SIGNS:  She was afebrile with a pulse in the high 90s
and a blood pressure in the high 180s/90s.  She was
saturating 96% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
HEART:  She was in regular rate and rhythm.
CHEST:  Crackles bilaterally halfway up the lung fields and
she had a dressing placed over her sternotomy with purulent
exudate on the inferior portion.

ADMISSION LABS:  White count of 6.9, hematocrit of 25.4.  BUN
and creatinine of 40/0.8.  Gram stain of the wound
demonstrated gram positive cocci in pairs, chains and
clusters.  Given these findings, the patient was continued on
his vancomycin 1 gm intravenous q 12 hours and ciprofloxacin
500 mg b.i.d. was added for gram negative coverage.
Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted to come and evaluate the
patient.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After consultation with cardiac surgery,
the patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**8-25**]
where a radical sternal debridement and open packing of the
wound were performed for a sternal wound infection with
associated sternal osteomyelitis.  This was performed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], assisted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11743**].  An infectious disease consult
was also requested which also recommended continuing of the
vancomycin, ciprofloxacin as it appeared to be adequate
coverage for the patient's infections.  The cultures obtained
from the sternal swab in the Emergency Room had demonstrated
coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus, probable
Enterococcus and Proteus.

The patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit and a plastic
surgery consult was requested for possible flap closure of
his sternum.  The plastic surgeons recommended flap closure
of the wound and the patient was taken to the Operating Room
once again on [**8-29**] where an omental flap closure of
his sternal wound was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], assisted by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Postoperatively, the patient was continued on
his vancomycin and ciprofloxacin and was doing well,
transferred to the floor.  The patient's creatinine was
noted, however, to double on postoperative day #2, climbing
from 0.7 to 1.4 and peaking over the next couple days at 2.
Given the development of acute renal failure, the patient's
antibiotics were changed to renal doses.  The patient's urine
sediment was examined and did not demonstrate any evidence
ATN.  The FENa was not less than 1% and there was no evidence
of acute interstitial nephritis at the time.

Over the next couple of days, the renal failure began to
resolve with a decrease in the creatinine to 1.9 and then 1.8
respectively.  The patient was making good urine and remained
afebrile with stable vital signs.  Given the fact that her
sternotomy was healing very well with no erythema, edema,
induration or drainage and the abdominal incision that was
used for a flap was well healed with any erythema, edema,
induration or drainage and that the patient had a PICC line
placed and was capable of having intravenous antibiotics at a
rehabilitation facility, it was felt that she was stable for
transfer.  She was transferred on a regular diet.
