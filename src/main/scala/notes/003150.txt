History of Present Illness:
80 year old male with hx, CVA, SBO's, prostate CA, recently
discharged after ventral hernia repair who presents with fevers,
AMS and hypotension. Per the daughter's report, the patient has
been drowsy and delerious since discharge but has become more
somnolent over the past 3-4 days. Two nights ago, he began
spiking fevers. He was diagnosed with a UTI and given several
doses of Levofloxacin. Subsuquently, his blood cultures grew
GPC's and he got Vancomycin. Today his blood pressure lowered,
with SBP's in 80's. His creatinine increased from 0.9-> 1.3
overnight, and his hemoglobin dropped from 10-.7.6 over the past
6 days. He was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] via ambulance from [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab.
.
Notably on last admission, he was on the surgery service for
SBO. This was intially managed conservatively. The patient then
developed respiratory distress and hypoxia. He was transfered to
the SICU for a question of aspiration PNA vs PE. LENI neg, V/Q
scan neg- PE r/o. Eventually, it was decided that he did not
have an aspiration PNA and that his tachypnea was [**1-7**] distended
abd. He was taken to the OR and found to have an incarcerated
hernia which was repaired. He was discharged on [**9-22**] to [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab.
.
In the ED his vital were temp 101.6 pt SBP 97-112/46-67, HR 98
RR 30 SaO2 97% NRB. A CXR was performed with new RUL infitrate.
he was tachypnic to 30's and hypoxic. He was given
[**Doctor Last Name **]/Zosyn/Levo. He received 3liters NS and 1 units pRBC's w/o
improvement of BP. Cr 1.4, baseline 0.9. Trop 0.12. EKG w/o
ischemia. Lactate 2.0. He was seen by the surgical service who
did not think that his presentation was secondary to an
abodominal process or related to his recent surgery.
.
MEDICINE TRANSFER HPI:
80M with PMH of CVA, small bowel obstruction, metastatic
prostate CA, who was admitted on [**2192-9-28**] with fevers, altered
mental status and was found to have MRSA bacteremia and aortic
valve endocarditis. Prior to his current admission he was
admitted from [**Date range (3) 77130**] for small bowel obstruction which
was complicated by incarcerated hernia which also required
surgical treatment.
.
He was initially admitted to the MICU for sepsis as he was
febrile and hypotensive. Source was initially thought to be PNA
given RUL infiltrate on CXR and hypoxia and he was treated with
vanc/zosyn/levo. Her was persistently hypoxic and on an NRB mask
for a prolonged period of time. He was also anemic on admission
with HCT 22 and guaiac positive stools concerning for GI source.
In addition, he had a CT on admission showing early SBO. He was
treated with an NG tube and fluids. On [**2192-9-30**] his blood
cultures came back positive for MRSA and pip/tazo + levofloxacin
were d/c'd and he was continued on vancomycin alone. Despite
treatment with vancomycin, he continued to have positive blood
cultures and fevers. He developed a pleural fluid which was
concerning for empyema. A pleuroscentesis showed the fluid was
transudative. ID was then asked to consult on the pt. All lines
were removed. He had an initial TTE showing no definite valvular
vegetation and was felt not to be stable enough for a TEE.
Gentamicin was started on for synergy given continued
bacteremia. A repeat ECHO showed a large aortic valve vegetation
and severe AR meeting criteria for surgery. On the evening of
[**9-8**] he was intubated due to increasing oxygen requirements and
work of breathing from heart failure due to aortic
insufficiency. He was also started on levophed for hypotension.
On [**2192-10-11**] he underwent to surgery for a porcine valve
replacement and was transfused 9U pRBC perioperatively for a
post op HCT of 30.
.
Post operatively he was cared for in the cardio-thoracic ICU.
Regarding his ongoing bacteremia, he was changed from vancomycin
+ daptomycin to linezolid on [**2192-10-12**] due to BCx positive Staph.
aureus intermediately resistant to vancomycin and daptomycin. On
[**2192-10-12**] he developed Afib with RBR and was started on amiodarone
400mg [**Hospital1 **] following loading with an IV drip. Per cardiology this
was decreased to 400mg daily on [**2192-10-18**]. He is planned to
decrease to 200mg PO daily on [**2192-10-24**] and continue at that dose
for a week. Regarding his volume status, he is >18L positive
this admission. He was started on lasix 20mg IV BID on [**2192-10-12**]
which was increased to 40mg IV BID on [**2192-10-18**]. He was extubated
on [**2192-10-14**]. Regarding his abdominal pain, on [**2192-10-15**] he had a
KUB and RUQ u/s for abdominal pain and concern for SBO vs
cholecystitis. The KUB showed non obstructive bowel gas pattern
with retained contrast c/w delayed transit. His RUQ ultrasound
showed no evidence of cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. He had
not moved his bowels in several days and did have bowel movement
following lactulose. LFT's were slightly elevated on [**2192-10-11**] but
were improved on repeat [**2192-10-15**]
.
On tranfer to the medicine service his vital signs were 98.4
121/78 71 18 97% on 3L. He remains delerius but responsive. He
had pulled out his NG tube that day so cannot get PO meds or
feeds. Otherwise he is stable. He denies pain but winces on
abdominal exam. He can answer yes or no and at time speaks full
sentances.
