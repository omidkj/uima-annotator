abdominal pain, tenesmus

arterial line
internal jugular central venous line

History of Present Illness:
57 year old female with stage 1 breast cancer s/p initiation of
docetaxel and carboplatin on [**2126-8-2**], now presenting with
abdominal pain and dysuria. Most of the following history was
obtained by the ED team, prior to her decompensation.  Her
symptoms started this AM, with frequency and urgency. She
characterizes the suprapubic pain as sharp and radiating to back
and right flank. Symptoms notable for intermittent chills and
diaphoresis, nausea with one episode of vomitous.  Her last
bowel movement was this morning without bright red blood.  She
has been passing flatus.  As her pain worsened throughout the
day, she called the [**Hospital **] clinic and proceeded to the ED.

She did contact her oncologist ([**Name (NI) **]) on [**8-5**] with multiple
issues, including hyperglycemia to the 300s-400s, acute on
chronic back pain, and constipation with mild abdominal pains.
She was instructed to report to the ED for insulin
administration if her FSBGs were > 400.  She was started on
acetaminophen 1000mg TID for her pain.  She attributed her
abdominal pain at that time to constipation because she had not
stooled in 2 days.

In the ED, initial vitals were: 98 115 97/51 16 100%, pain
[**9-11**].
Exam was notable for right CVA and suprapubic tenderness,
without peritoneal signs.  IVFs were started at this point when
the lactate returned at 7.0.  With neutropenia of 0.5, she was
covered with Vancomycin and Cefepime.  Her blood pressures then
started to decline and she became more tachypneic and in
increasing respiratory distress.  She was then intubated for
airway protection and levophed was started for her hypotension.
She was given vecuronium earlier in the evening due to
overbreathing the vent. CT abdomen showed extensive inflammatory
mural thickening/stranding of the distal descending
colon/sigmoid and rectum with free intraperitoneal fluid, not
likely ischemic colitis.  Surgery was consulted and did not feel
she was a surgical candidiate.  When she maxed out on levophed,
dopamine was added and both pressors are running through her
port-a-cath.  She is tolerating the ventilator, sedated on
fentanyl/midazolam with most recent ABG of 7.21 / 36 / 78
(450/20/5/100%).  Bedside TTE did not suggest cardiac
involvement, without any RV strain.  Total IVF 7L.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient is intubated, sedated, and
requiring a 3rd pressor.

   Anaerobic Bottle Gram Stain (Final [**2126-8-11**]):    GRAM
NEGATIVE ROD(S).

CT abdomen: IMPRESSION:  Extensive inflammatory mural thickening
and stranding involving the distal descending colon, sigmoid and
rectum with accompanying free intraperitoneal fluid, but no free
air.  The differential considerations for this process given the
patient's history include chemotherapeutic drug toxicity,
infectious process and vasculitis.  Ischemia is less likely
given the distribution.
