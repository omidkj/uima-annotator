fall
while at home today and transported to [**Hospital3 417**] where he
was intubated for airway protection and found to have large
5X4cm
L ICH with extension into both lateral ventricles and 4th
ventricle.  He was transferred here for further evaluation and
care.  He was initially seen per NSURG who did not recommend
surgical intervention currently hence neurology was consulted.

Patient is intubated and sedated and unable to give own hx.
Spoke to daughter who is next of [**Doctor First Name **] who reports that she has
not
seen him for a few weeks but is aware that he was told per PCP
(Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 9404**]) that he is bound to fall given his overall
weakness from co-morbidities including ESRD for which he is
getting 3x/week dialysis for the past 1.5 years.

There is no report of recent illness or infection but the
details
are unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] does live alone and independently but
girlfriend lives in an apartment a few units down per daughter.

Patient's INR was 2.5 at OSH hence he received FFP and Vitamin
K.

Vitamin K and Profiline.  He remains intubated and sedated with
repeat head CT showing no enlargement of the head bleed.

NCHCT [**2193-1-31**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large left intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered about left
thalamus, but
involving left temporal lobe and intraventricular system.
2. Mass effect, 4-mm right shift of midline structures
indicative of
subfalcine herniation, and surrounding edema.
3. No evidence of transtentorial herniation.


NCHCT [**2193-2-4**]:
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change in extensive left
thalamic and
temporal lobe intraparenchymal hemorrhage with associated edema
and mass
effect.


Brief Hospital Course:
75 M w/ hx AF, previously on coumadin and ESRD on HD, presented
with a large Left ICH with intraventricular extension as
outlined in the HPI. Neurosx felt no intervention was necessary.
He remained intubated with little in the way of neuro exam save
initially some movement of all but his RUE to noxious. Over days
he developed a PNA for which he was treated with Abx and he was
ultimately completely non-responsive to noxious stimulation.
After one week in the ICU, his family decided that they did not
want to proceed with trach/PEG, noting that he would never have
wanted to have been kept alive connected to tubes. He was made
CMO on [**2-6**] and expired on [**2-7**].
