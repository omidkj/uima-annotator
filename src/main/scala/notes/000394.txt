HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old
woman with a past medical history notable for peptic ulcer
disease with a history of "bleeding ulcer," coronary artery
disease, diabetes mellitus type 2 and multiple sclerosis, who
presented to the [**Hospital1 69**]
emergency department early on the morning of admission
complaining of epigastric pain.  The patient stated that,
approximately two weeks prior to presentation, she began
experiencing diarrhea alternating with constipation.  Then,
approximately two days prior to admission, the patient began
having only constipation.  When the patient did have bowel
movements, they were black and tarry.  This was an
unprecedented occurrence for her.  The patient denied having
any recent hematochezia, hemoptysis or hematemesis.

At approximately 2 AM on the morning of admission, the
patient was awakened by epigastric pain which was [**6-10**] in
severity and constant in duration.  The patient could not
describe the quality of pain.  She felt that it was well
localized to her epigastrium, although she admitted that she
also experienced interscapular pain with this episode of
epigastric pain.  She was not surprised by this, as she
reported that she had interscapular pain "whenever I get
stomachaches--since I was a kid."  The patient was brought by
EMS to the [**Hospital1 69**] emergency
department, where her pain abated completely shortly after
receiving Maalox at approximately 9:30 AM.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Of note, the patient admitted that for
approximately five years her stool had been of smaller
caliber.  She denied any other change in her bowel or bladder
patterns.  She specifically denied fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea or headache.  She denied sore throat,
cough, recent change in weight and night sweats.  In terms of
the patient's cardiovascular status, she specifically denied
having had any pain radiating to her left jaw (her anginal
equivalent) since her coronary artery bypass grafting in
[**2141**].  She denied chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations,
diaphoresis, lower extremity edema, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea and orthopnea.  (Although she used two pillows for
sleeping, she said that she did not become dyspneic without
them.)  The patient denied any recent illnesses, including
changes in her multiple sclerosis.  Similarly, she denied
recent changes in her appetite, diet and medication regimen.
Her fingerstick blood sugars had been consistently running
under 120.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient had no history of
known myocardial infarction.  She did have angina (left jaw
pain), which led to cardiac catheterization, which
subsequently led to coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2151**].
The patient had not had any angina since her coronary artery
bypass grafting.
2.  Congestive heart failure:  The patient had an ejection
fraction of 20-25% by echocardiogram in [**2155-10-2**] with
left ventricular hypokinesis, moderate mitral regurgitation
and mild pulmonary hypertension.
3.  Peptic ulcer disease:  The patient had a history of a
"bleeding ulcer" in [**2146**] with hematochezia.  Per the patient,
this was an upper gastrointestinal bleed.  No intervention
was required at that time.  No pertinent records were
currently available for this history of bleeding ulcer.  The
patient was on ranitidine.
4.  Diabetes mellitus type 2:  This was diagnosed
approximately one year prior to admission, per the patient.
This was well controlled on Glyburide with fingersticks
consistently under 120.
5.  Hypertension:  Per the patient, her blood pressure
typically ran in the 120s-130s/80s.
6.  Hypercholesterolemia.
7.  Multiple sclerosis:  This was diagnosed when the patient
was approximately 35 years old.  Per the patient, this had
not affected her vision but rather her lower extremities and
balance, such that she had difficulty walking well.
8.  Spinal stenosis.
9.  Mild dementia.
10. Urinary incontinence, likely functional, as the patient
had trouble getting to the bathroom in time.
11. History of right shoulder pain, status post a fall.
12. Chronic lower back pain, which continued status post
laminectomy in [**2148**].
13. Status post appendectomy in [**2120**].
14. Status post surgery to correct trigeminal neuralgia in
[**2118**].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lived alone at home in
[**Location (un) **], [**State 350**].  She had two boarders who lived
upstairs in her home.  She would like to move to an [**Hospital3 12272**] facility soon.  The patient denied a tobacco history.
She admitted rare alcohol use, but not abuse.  The patient
denied any other drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed a
temperature of 97.2??????F, a heart rate of 86, a blood pressure
of 171/86 in the left arm and 181/80 in the right arm,
respirations of 14 per minute and an oxygen saturation of 97%
on room air.  In general, the patient was a pleasant
75-year-old woman, awake and in bed, in no acute distress.
On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, the pupils
were equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation
bilaterally.  The extraocular movements were intact
bilaterally.  The nasal and oral mucosa were clear.  The
mucous membranes were moist.  The neck was supple without
thyromegaly, jugular venous distention, lymphadenopathy or
bruits.

The heart had a II/VI systolic ejection murmur heard
maximally at the apex with a sinus S1 and S2 and no rubs or
gallops.  The chest had mildly decreased breath sounds with
occasional rhonchi at the bases bilaterally.  Otherwise, the
chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally with a well
healed sternotomy scar.

The abdomen was soft, but mildly tender to palpation,
especially in the left lower quadrant.  The abdomen was
nondistended with positive normal active bowel sounds.  There
was a well healed midline scar, apparently due to exploratory
laparotomy, which eventually led to appendectomy.  The
gastrointestinal evaluation revealed dark stool that was
guaiac positive.  The patient was nasogastrically lavaged in
the emergency department with 250 cc of fluid, revealing no
blood and no bile.

In the extremities, the venous graft harvest site was well
healed at the right lower extremity with no clubbing,
cyanosis or edema.  Pedal pulses were 2+ bilaterally.  On
neurological examination, the patient was alert and oriented
times three.  Speech was normal and appropriate.  Cranial
nerves II through XII were intact bilaterally with the
possible exception of the tongue deviating slightly to the
right.  Strength was [**4-5**] in the upper extremities and lower
extremities proximally and distally bilaterally.  Sensation
was intact to light touch bilaterally at the distal lower and
upper extremities as well as the three divisions of cranial
nerve V.  Rapid alternating movements were intact
bilaterally.  Reflexes were 0 at the lower extremities
bilaterally and 2+ symmetrically at the upper extremities.
The right toe was downgoing and the left toe was equivocal.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Note that the patient was
guaiac positive, but nasogastric lavage negative (as noted
above.)  The CBC revealed a white blood cell count of 10,300,
hematocrit of 30.0 (which upon repeat was 31) and platelet
count of 289,000.  Chem 7 revealed a sodium of 138, potassium
of 6.0 (which upon repeat was 4.0), chloride of 108,
bicarbonate of 19, BUN of 49, creatinine of 1.3 and glucose
of 121.  Coagulation studies revealed a prothrombin time of
12.4, partial thromboplastin time of 25.6 and INR of 1.0.
Liver function tests and pancreatic
