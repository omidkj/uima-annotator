Chief Complaint:
VT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EP endocardial mapping


History of Present Illness:
73 yo M h/o non-ischemic CM (EF 20-25%), AF s/p AV node ablation
s/p BiV ICD, h/o VT with shocks presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital
with sustained VT @ 150 bpm requiring ICD shocks.  Patient had a
pacer/ICD upgrade in [**2128-11-2**] and was initiated on
amiodarone therapy.  Since that time, he had not experienced any
shocks until the day of admission to [**Hospital3 **].  He received
three shocks in the morning, separated by 30-60 seconds apiece.
He described concomitant chest tightness and some mild dizziness
but denied acute SOB or syncope.  He was admitted to [**Hospital3 **]
Hospital and was loaded with amiodarone with 150 mg, then 1
mg/hr x 6 hrs, then amiodarone gtt @ 0.5 mg/hr.  His blood
pressure remained in the 80s-90s systolic, which is within his
baseline.  He was ruled out for MI.  He was also felt to be in
acute on chronic heart failure and received one dose of IV
lasix, to which he responded well.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for VT ablation.  Given that his INR was 2.7, he was given
vitamin K in preparation for the procedure.
.
The patient reports feeling "down" for the last week, and notes
increased dyspnea on exertion and PND.  He denied LE swelling.
He takes 3-4L of home O2 at night for his heart failure at
baseline, and did not increase this.  He also notes a cough
productive of green sputum x 1 month, but states that he was
diagnosed with sinusitis and started on antibiotics a week or
two ago, after which his cough improved.  He denies fevers,
chills, N/V/D, abd pain.  He denies chest pain at rest.

Past Medical History:
1.  Systolic heart failure with LVEF of 20-25%, thought to be
[**1-4**] viral cardiomyopathy ~20 years ago s/p BiV/ICD implantation
2.  Atrial fibrillation with AV node ablation.
3.  Ventricular tachycardia with recent shocks.
4.  Right shoulder surgery.
5.  Mild hypotension.

Social History:
The patient is married.  He continues to work
parttime as a carpenter.  He has two grown children and two
grandchildren.  He smoked in the army and has not smoked for
more
than 20 years.  Occasional ETOH, but none in the past year.  No
illicit drug use.

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

Physical Exam:

Pertinent Results:
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2129-4-28**] at 10:00:00 AM
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20%). Only the
anterior wall and lateral wall have any degree of systolic
function. The estimated cardiac index is depressed
(<2.0L/min/m2). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2128-11-8**], LV
dilatation and dysfunction and valvular regurgitation are all
similar. The degree of dyssynchrony may have improved however
formal dyssynchrony evaluation could not be performed as tissue
synchronization imaging was not performed.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 yo M h/o CHF (EF 15-20%) s/p BiV/ICD placement, AF s/p AV
node ablation, h/o VT p/w sustained VT s/p ICD firing x 3 and
subsequent conversion, on amiodarone load admitted for VT
ablation, now s/p endocardial mapping, which did not find any
endocardial source for VT
.
# NONSUSTAINED VT - Patient was evaluated by EP, underwent
endocardial mapping without an endocardial source for VT
identified.  Arrythmogenic focus thought to be epicardial,
likely due to some scarring on exterior of heart.  Patient is
planned for epicardial mapping on a separate admission.  During
his stay in the CCU, patient continued to have asymptomatic runs
of VT, but not tachycardic enough to trigger his ICD, which is
set at a threshold of 150.  Patient was continued on amiodarone,
uptitrated on metoprolol, and started on mexilitine.  Patient
was also continued on warfarin for goal INR of [**1-5**].  On
discharge, patient's INR was 1.2 and so was discharged with
lovenox bridge.  Patient was instructed to have his INR checked
in 2 days for further management of warfarin dosing.  He will
continue to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
.
# PUMP/CHF - The symptoms the patient described on the week
prior to admission are suggestive of acute heart failure.  TTE
on this admission shows he has severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis with LVEF of 15-20%.  Patient appeared euvolemic and
was continued on furosemide and metoprolol.  Lisinopril was held
given hypotension and possible acute renal failure.  Patient
will follow up with his cardiologist who will advise as to when
to restart the ACE inhibitor.
.
# HYPOTENSION - noted to be slightly hypotensive on admission,
but for the rest of his admission, his blood pressure was at his
baseline SBP in the 90's.
.
# ELEVATED CREATININE ?????? unknown baseline creatinine.  Attempts
to contact the P
