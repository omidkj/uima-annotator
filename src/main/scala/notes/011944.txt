[**5-16**] CXR: Lungs were clear of an acute process.  The heart is
generally enlarged.  A battery apparatus seen in the left
pectoral area with right atrial and right ventricular leads.
CONCLUSION:  No evidence of active inflammatory disease or
failure.

ECG:
Regular ventricularly paced rhythm. Underlying rhythm is
probably atrial
fibrillation


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 84 year old woman with history of dementia, CVA,
CHF, CAD, atrial fibrillation who presented with GI bleeding.
The following issues were addressed on this admission:

1.GIB: Appears to be lower GI bleed by history, though could be
brisk UGIB. Pt at risk for bleed given on coumadin and ASA at
home.  GI was consulted and decided that because of the
patient's mental status intubation would be required for
preparation and scope for colonoscopy.  Given her DNR/DNI status
it was decided that endoscopy would not be done at this time.
The patient's anticoagulation was reversed with FFP and Vitamin
K.  Aspirin and coumadin held.  A total of 7 units of pRBC's
given until hematocrit stabilized on [**5-17**].  Crit stable between
27-30 throughout [**Date range (1) 17392**]  Given goals of care, decision made
not to pursue colonoscopy which would require sedation and
intubation.  Decision made along with PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 8467**], and HCP,
[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].  For now aspirin and coumadin will continue to be
held, to be re-started at discretion of PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will need
daily hematocrit monitoring at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2299**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

.
2. Acute renal failure, chronic kidney disease: Likely all
secondary to hypovolemia, pre-renal.  Improved with blood and
ivf's.  Baseline appears to be around 1.1-1.2  Creatinine on
discharge 1.2 Ace inhibition to be re-started as outpatient,
held given acute renal failure.
.
3. Cardiovascular: Coronary artery disease: aspirin held
throughout given bleeding.  Beta blocker and ace inhibitor held
with GI bleeding, hypovolemia, relative hypotension and renal
failure.  Statin continued.  NSTEMI: troponin leak, likely
demand in setting of GI bleeding.  continue statin.  Re-start
aspirin, ace, beta [**Last Name (un) 86928**] at discretion of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8467**] as
outpatient.
Congestive Heart failure: LV systolic dysfunction with ef 40%.
Ace, beta blocker and outpatient lasix held given GI bleeding,
renal failure, hypotension.  Lasix re-started on [**5-19**] as patient
with some shortness of breath, crackles on exam.
Atrial fibrillation: coumadin held in setting of large GI bleed.
 Beta blocker held as above.
.
4. Hypernatremia: developed with fluid repletion, mostly NS.
Free water given and resolved.
.
5.Dementia/episodic delirium: Pt confused and often combative at
baseline [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] caregivers.  Continued risperdal, trazodone
and paxil.
.
6. UTI: hospital acquired UTI likely secondary to urinary
catheterization. Catheter removed on [**5-19**].  Cipro started [**5-19**].
Will require 7 day course, started [**5-19**] evening, urine culture
pending.
.
7.glaucoma: continued home eye drops
.
8.hypothyroidism: continued home synthroid.  TSH mildly elevated
but free T4 wnl.
.
9. Osteoporosis: Actonel held given GI bleeding.  Continued on
calcium
