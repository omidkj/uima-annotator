Chief Complaint:
blood per rectum

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
gastroduodenal endoscopy


History of Present Illness:
85yo F with history of atrial fibrillation and CHF who presents
to the ED with melena and orthostasis for one day. Patient
denies nausea/vomiting/chest pain/shortness of
breath/hemetemesis. Patient woke up feeling dizzy and has been
lying in bed since then. Her health aide came to see her and
found her lying in a pool of blood. Patient denies prior
occurence. Patient does not know her INR monitoring schedule as
it is done routinely by clinic and she would be notified only if
there was something wrong. She has not been sick and has not
been taking any antibiotics. She denies OTC drug/new
medication/herbal medication. Patient denies taking extra
coumadin but there could be possible mix up in dosing [**Name8 (MD) **] NP. In
the ED, her vital signs were T96.4 P86 BP 121/72 R 16 100% on
RA. Her initial BP at home was reported as 60/palp. NO
intervention between home and ED. Physical exam in ED reveals
frank melena and external hemorrhoid. Her initial INR was 6.5.
She received 1U PRBC in ED although her Hct was 34 given that
she has frank melena. She also received 2 units of FFP. CXR was
normal.
  Pt was admitted to MICU and GI consulted with plan for a
scope.  She was found to be hypernatremic with a sodium of 150
and a 3L free water deficit. She was started on D5W at 75 cc an
hour and Na is now 147.  She received a total of 5 units of
pRBCs since admission and her HCT still is hovering around 29%.
This AM pt had episode of chest pain in the MICU. She describes
it as  a ??????chest twinge??????. Lasted only seconds. She has had these
before and states ??????they are a signal for me to slow down??????.
During this time her heart rate dropped into the 40s. No EKG
changes seen and first set of cardiac enzymes negative. Scope is
deferred while pt is ruled out for MI in the setting of GIB.

[**2167-11-2**] 1:10:30 PM - EGD report
Esophagus:
 Lumen: A 4 cm hiatal hernia was seen.
Stomach:
 Excavated Lesions A single non-bleeding ulcer was found in the
posterior wall of stomach.
Duodenum:
 Excavated Lesions A single diverticulum was found in the second
part of the duodenum.
Impression: Ulcer in the pre-pyloric region
Small hiatal hernia
Diverticulum in the second part of the duodenum
Recommendations: Protonix 40 mg Twice daily
Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5351**] as needed

 ECHO Study Date of [**2167-11-2**]

The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic
valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**2-1**]+) mitral
regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

CT abd/pel [**2167-11-3**]

CT OF ABDOMEN AND PELVIS.

Two small granulomas are identified within the liver.  The liver
otherwise
appears unremarkable.  The patient is status post
cholecystectomy.  No intra-
or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation is identified. The pancreas
is
unremarkable. Normal spleen.  The adrenal glands appear normal.
A small amount
of contrast material is identified within the excretory system
of both
kidneys.  Some contrast material is also identified within the
bladder.  The
kidneys and adrenals are normal.

Multiple small lymph nodes are identified within the upper
abdomen.  No
obvious masses are identified within the stomach or upper GI
system.  The
visualized portions of the large and small bowel appear
unremarkable.

CT PELVIS.

Excess soft tissue is identified at the region of the introitus
suggesting
prolapse.  Correlation with clinical symptoms is identified.
Contrast material
is identified within the bladder.  These appearances should be
correlated with
history of recent contrast administration.  The bladder
otherwise appears
unremarkable.

CT OF BONES.

Multilevel severe degenerative disease is identified within the
dorsal spine.
In addition, extensive degenerative disease is identified in
both hips.



Brief Hospital Course:
*melena: In the setting of elevated INR,pt was intially treated
with volume rescucitation and transfused to a HCT goal of >30.
She was started on IV pantropazole with a plan for endoscopic
evaluation. Pt had episode of cheestpain and bradycardia (see
below). EGD was delayed until cardiac status was
stabilized/assessed. Pt recieved a total of 6 units of pRBCs
during her hospitalization. Her HCT stabilized on PPI at a level
between 30 and 33. EGD showed a non-bleeding ulcer in the
posterior wall of the stomach. Given her age and weight loss
there was a concern for malignancy. GI felt that on visual
inspection th
