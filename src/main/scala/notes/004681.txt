History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 81 y/o f with nsclc s/p lul lobectomy, RCC s/p
nephrectomy, htn, cad (MI [**2168**]), afib, cva who presented to
[**Hospital6 **] with two to three days of increasing
palpitations and shortness of breath. She also noticed
concurrent hand discomfort bilaterally. She denies any f/c,
chest pain, n/v/d, abdominal pain, or dysuria, but she does note
a chronic "smoker's" cough. The shortness of breath occurs at
rest but is most noticeable with exertion; she is unable to walk

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2171-10-8**]  8:22:10 AM
Atrial fibrillation
Low limb lead QRS voltages - is nonspecific
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities - cannot exclude in part
ischemia - clinical
correlation is suggested
.

[**10-8**] CXR IMPRESSION:
1. No pneumothorax.
2. Mild pulmonary edema, likely reflecting CHF.
3. Interval increase in left retrocardiac opacity, which could
be atelectasis dependent edema, or developing pneumonia, alone
or in combination.
.
[**10-7**] Echo
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
basal inferior
and basal and mid inferolateral akinesis. The other walls are
hyperdynamic.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 y/o f with nsclc, rcc, HTN, cad, afib, s/p nephrectomy [**3-13**]
renal cell CA, and cva presents to osh with palpitations and sob
and found to be in rapid afib with a slight troponin leak now
s/p cardiac catheterization revealing 2 VD with unsuccessful
passage of wire across [**Month/Day (2) 8714**] lesion, hypotension, decreased RR and
runs of VT, intubated and sedated on levophed and lidocaine with
variable improvement requiring pressors who decided to become
[**Month/Day (2) 3225**].

# CAD:  Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for catheterization. RHC
showed relatively normal filling pressures (PCWP 11). When dye
was injected to do left heart cath she developed an acute drop
in BP, chest pain, bradycardia with ST depressions in V2-V5 and
mental status changes. She has decreased respiratory rate and
anesthesia was called to intubate her. She was given atropine
and was started on dopamine, but became tachycardic and had a
runs of VT with a stable blood pressure. She was started on
lidocaine drip and given 150 mg of amiodarone. She was weaned
off of the dopamine and then was started on levophed. Multiple
attempts were amde to cross the [**Hospital1 8714**] lesion, but were
unsuccessful.Echo in the lab showed LVEF 55% with hypokinesis of
the inferior wall and severe MR. She was transferred to the CCU
, intubatred and sedated on levophed and lidocaine drip.
Initially unclear if [**Name (NI) 8714**] lesion was acutely active or chronic
with some demand ischemia. As Cardiac enzymes continued to rise,
seems that an acute coronary event occurred.  CT surgery
reviewed films and felt that patient was not a surgical
candidate.  We continued to trend enzymes and recheck EKGs.
Continued [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], plavix did not having surgery,
continued statin, heparin gtt.  On [**10-9**], a decision was made to
make the pt [**Name (NI) 3225**] per pt and family. We discussed this with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] who agreed with plan. Pt decided to have comfort measures
only and to discontinue pressors and other non pain relieving
medications. We discontinued antibiotics since patient was no
longer responsive to stimuli off pressors and she expired on
[**10-9**] appearing quite comfortable.
.
# Hypotension: Possibly secondary to active ischemia in cath lab
and VT  (see above, pt required pressors, then weaned off- then
unable to tolerate her own BP and placed on again.
.
# A-fib -- Pt has long standing paroxysmal a-fib, likely related
to cad, la enlargement, or age-related conduction abnormalities.
 She remained in continuous a fib most likely [**3-13**] ischemia and
remained on heparin drip.
.
# VT - Most likely secondary to ischemia.
