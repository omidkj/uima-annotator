History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year-old male smoker with a history of severe
COPD on home [**Known lastname 20358**] (4L), dCHF, and DM2 who presents from home
with dypnea and respiratory failure.  He was recently discharged
on [**2120-12-19**] after being admitted for a COPD exacerbation (3 day
hospital stay) and was sent to [**Hospital3 105**] rehab.  He did
well at rehab and arrived home yesterday.  Since this morning,
per his wife, he began feeling increasingly dyspneic and fatigue
and had fevers; he has a chronic productive cough at baseline
which was unchanged.  He then called EMS after finishing
[**Holiday 1451**] dinner with his family.  Of note, his daughter has
cystic fibrosis and is "coming down with a cold."  No pets at
home.
.
He was noted by EMS to be dyspneic and received nebs without
improvement.  He desatted with a NRB and was intubated en route
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, vital signs were initially:  103.4 rectal 96 109/53
99% on vent settings of cmv 550 x 16, peep 8, fio2 100%.  A CXR
demonstrated a RLL infiltrate.  He was given 2.5L IVF, vanc,
ceftriaxone, and levoflox and admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

STUDIES:

CXR [**2121-1-9**]: Patchy opacities bilaterally which could be
consistent with
multifocal pneumonia and/or aspiration. Possible overlying
pulmonary edema. Trace right pleural effusion.

CXR [**2121-1-14**]: Relatively symmetric ground-glass opacification in
the lower lung zones is most likely pulmonary edema. Heart is
normal size. The mediastinal veins are distended. Left jugular
vein ends in the upper SVC. Lung bases are excluded from the
examination. Upper pleural margins show no abnormality, but some
pleural effusion could be present.

EKG: Artifact is present. Sinus tachycardia. Probably normal
tracing. Compared to the previous tracing there is no
significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year-old male smoker with a history of severe
COPD on home [**Known lastname 20358**] (4L), DM2, and diastolic heart failure who
presented to the ICU from home (after a brief stay at rehab
following recent hospitalization) with dyspnea and respiratory
failure.  Due to worsening respiratory effort he was intubated
in the field, transported to the emergency department and
admitted to the ICU.
.
1. Hypoxic/hypercapneic respiratory failure:  His respiratory
failure was felt to be secondary to pneumonia complicated by
COPD exacerbation. Mr. [**Known lastname **] has history of multiple COPD
exacerbations and pneumonia episodes in past, for which he has
been intubated, and he continues to smoke.  He presented to the
ICU on [**1-9**], intubated with ABG consistent with chronic
respiratory acidosis. He was started on empiric vancomycin and
zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia (given recent
hospitalization and rehab stay) as well as azithromycin for
atypical coverage.  His antibiotics were eventually switched to
Levaquin after a bronchoalveolar lavage culture grew
stenotrophomonas maltophilia that was sensitive to Levaquin.  He
was started on tamiflu empirically, and had a flu swab that
later returned negative and his Tamiflu was discontinued. He was
extubated on [**2121-1-12**] without complication.  He was initially on
high dose solumedrol IV which was transitioned to prednisone 60
mg po daily. Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (outpatient pulmonologist), he
should continue this dose of prednisone until he his seen in
clinic.  He completed a 9 day course of levaquin for his
hospital acquired Stenotrophomonas pneumonia. At time of
discharge patient is requiring albuterol nebs q3h and
ipratropium nebs q6h to prevent acute exacerbation.  Patient
would also likely benefit a great deal by BiPAP.  He was seen by
Respiratory Therapy on the medical floor and started on
intermittent BiPAP. Recommend continuing to offer BiPAP for
intermittent relief and throughout night. Smoking cessation
(reportedly has not smoked since [**11-22**] hospital admission) was
congratulated and abstinence encouraged.  Patient is scheduled
to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic on [**2121-1-29**] to address
prednisone taper.
.
2. Acute Renal insufficiency:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] has a baseline
Creatinine of 0.7 which was elevated on admission to 1.7.  His
creatinine trended downward (1.0) during his [**Hospital **] hospital course
in response to IV fluid. The underlying etiology for ARF on
presentation was felt to be pre-renal in the setting of
pneumonia. With later diuresis on the medicine floor for volume
overload his creatinine fell to 0.8. suggesting his diastolic
dysfunction is a considerable contributor to compromised renal
function.
.
3. Hypertension: After receiving IV fluids and high dose
steroids for his pneumonia and COPD, he became hypertensive.  He
was restarted on his home amlodipine which was increased to 10mg
po daily.  He was also restarted on lisinopril 40 mg po daily
and lasix 60 mg po daily (discontinued on previous admission in
setting of ARF).
.
4. Diastolic CHF: Patient appeared volume overloaded on
presentation to the medicine floor.  Lasix was restarted and
patient was diuresed > 3 L.  Renal function improved with
diuresis. Continue antihypertensive regimen as listed about.
Recommend compression stockings and leg elevation to reduce
lower extremity edema.
.
5. Sinus Tachycardia: Persists throughout admission. Likely
secondary to frequent albuterol nebs and respiratory distress.
If tolerated attempt to decrease frequency of albuterol nebs to
decrease tachycardia and allow greater dias
