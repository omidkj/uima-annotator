Chief Complaint:
Asymptomatic

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2191-12-5**] Redo sternotomy and resection of proximal saphenous vein
graft > right coronary artery pseudoaneurysm

History of Present Illness:
72 year old male s/p CABG in [**2176**] who underwent angioplasty and
stenting in [**2189**] who now presents for evaluation of mediastinal
mass found on echocardiogram. The mass was originally discovered
in [**2189-5-3**] and was noted to be 5.5cm. A CT scan suggested it
may be a saphenous vein graft aneurysm while a PET scan showed
no evidence of malignancy. A recent echo now shows the mass to
measure 9.5cm. He was seen in clinic in [**Month (only) **] and has since
had an MRA which confirmed the diagnosis of a vein graft
pseudoaneurym. He also underwent a cardiac catheterization which
showed three vessel disease yet patent grafts. The vein grafts
were aneurysmal with the SVG->RCA being markedly aneurysmal. He
returns today for surgical planning.

Final Report
INDICATION: A 72-year-old man status post CABG, rule out
infection or
effusion.

COMPARISON: [**2191-12-6**]; [**2191-12-5**]; preoperative
film of [**12-1**], [**2191**].

CHEST, TWO VIEWS: Stable appearance to median sternotomy wires,
clips and
cardiomediastinal contours. Left linear atelectasis. Small
pleural effusions
are more prominent. Together with prominent Kerley B lines,
ovolume overload
is suggested. No pneumothorax. Hyperexpansion with prominent
retrosternal
airspace suggests COPD. Linear streaks of gas in the
retrosternal region is
likely post- operative. Mild degenerative changes are seen in
the spine.


The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on the same day of surgery and underwent
redo sternotomy with resection of pseudoaneurysm from saphenous
vein graft to right coronary artery. See operative report for
further details. He received cefazolin for perioperative
antibiotics and was transferred to the intensive care unit in
stable condition for hemodynamic management. Within the first
twenty four hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact, and was extubated without complications.
He continued to progress and was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day one. Chest tubes were removed on post-op day
one. Physical therapy worked with him on strength and mobility.
On post-op day four he appeared to be doing well and was
discharged home with VNA services and the appropriate follow-up
appointments.
