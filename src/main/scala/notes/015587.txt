The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2103-1-22**] where he underwent aortic valve
replacement with a 27-mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic Ultra aortic valve
bioprosthesis. Please see operative report for further details.
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1 found the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
 The patient was neurologically [**Company 5235**] and hemodynamically
stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.  Beta
blocker/Aspirin/diuresis was initiated and the patient was
gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight. He continued to
progress and was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication per protocol. During his hospital course he
did have an episode of slow A flutter with a history of
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and was restarted on Coumadin at
his home dose. He was in sinus rhythm at the time of discharge.
Mr[**Known lastname **] was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD #4 the patient was ambulating freely, hi incision was
healing well and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  He
was discharged to [**Hospital6 25759**] and Rehab in [**Location (un) **], MA in
good condition with appropriate follow up instructions advised.
