Admission Date:  [**2130-7-1**]              Discharge Date:   [**2130-7-8**]

Date of Birth:  [**2055-7-24**]             Sex:   M

Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

Allergies:
Protamine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
acute right ventricular infarct, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Four overlapping TAXUS stents in the saphenous vein graft to the
first obtuse marginal branch of the left circumflex artery


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 74 year old male with a history of COPD and
lung cancer status post right upper lobe lobectomy, CABG x 4 '[**18**]
([**Hospital1 2025**]), presented to LMH at 4pm on [**2130-7-3**] after having hours of
substernal chest pain where it was deemed he was having an
inferior STEMI for which he was transferred to [**Hospital3 1280**]
Hospital for PCI. At [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital, it was found that the
patient had an occluded saphenous vein graft to the right
coronary artery with serial lesions of SVG-->OM, LIMA patent.
The occluded SVG-->RCA was successfully opened however, the
procedure was completed by bradycardia, hypotension, wenchebach,
then VF arrest for which he was shocked five times with 300J and
underwent CPR. An endotracheal tube was placed for arrest w/
Vecuronium/versed/fentanyl. Residual ST elev post procedure
remained suggesting thromboembolism post procedure .
Hemodynamics in the cath lab suggested RV infarct (RA 14, wedge
11, Ratio = 1.2).  Echo at MWH w /HK, dilated RV, LV
inferobasal/inf HK w/ EF 40-45%. Requiring dopamine/aggressive
IVF for BP support. The patient was given [**Hospital3 **], plavix, amio gtt,
heparin gtt, integrillin. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 **]
sedated. He was noted to have unequal pupillary reaction (not
documented pre-cath) on admission to [**Hospital1 18**] with a CT of the head
that ruled out any acute intracranial hemorrhage. These physical
findings were attributed to the presence of cataracts. He
maintained an initial PA 47/24 and a wedge of 17 on dopamine.

Past Medical History:
lung cancer s/p RUL lobectomy
CAD CABG x4 '[**18**] ([**Hospital1 2025**])
hypothyroidism
osteoporosis

Social History:
The patient has a 40 year smoking history of 4 packs per day.
He is not fully retired, working part-time for a health policy
company and lives with his wife.


Family History:
Unknown.

HEENT - questionable pupil assymetry, 3 mm minimally reactive on
left, 1 mm reactive on the right, tongue with hematoma,
laceration on upper lip

Chest wall - Thoractomy scar on right, sternotomy scar clean,
dry and intact

The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of
the septum and inferior wall. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated. Systolic function could not be assessed. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not stenotic.
No definite aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD. Aortic sclerosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Cardiac:
Rhythm - The patient maintained sinus rhythm with AV nodal
conduction delay, PR of 0.2. He experienced no recurrences of
ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. He had occasional
blocked APCs and PVCs, all of which were asymptomatic.
Pump- The patient required occasional boluses of fluid initially
to maintain preload in the setting of RV dysfunction and
subsequent hypotension. He was not given an ACE-I secondary to
periods of hypotension nor was he placed on a beta-blocker for
similar concerns.
Coronary artery disease - The patient was maintained on aspirin
and plavix. He underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2130-7-7**] in
which his saphenous vein graft was stented x4 with overlapping
TAXUS stents with TIMI III flow and no residuals post-cath.
There was some blood loss with the procedure, however the repeat
hematocrit remained stable.
2. Pulm: The patient was maintained on atrovent, fluticasone
nebulizers. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] intubated and sedated.
He was extubated on [**2130-7-2**] without difficulty. He was maintained
on 5L O2 intially which was eventually weaned off to room air
without difficulty. He developed a productive cough
post-intubation with yellowish sputum. He remained afebrile and
repeat chest xrays showed no evidence of a pulmonary infiltrate
with negative sputum cultures. However, given his high risk for
pneumonia status post extubation with a history of severe COPD
and lung cancer, the patient was started on a 7 day course of
azithromycin 250 mg QD.
3. Endocrine - The patient was started on Levothyroxine 250 mcg
on [**2130-7-6**], the same dose as at home.
4. Musculoskeletal - The patient was continued on the same dose
calcitonin.
5. Renal - The patient's creatinine on admission was 1.4. He
maintained a creatinine around 1.3.
6. The patient tolerated the cardiac catheterization on [**2130-7-7**]
well and was able to ambulate asymptomatically while maintaining
his SBP >100. He was discharged to home without services with
recommended cardiac rehabilitation follow-up. The patient was
advised to follow up with his primary care physician or
cardiologist to consider adding a beta-blocker to his medical
regimen given his history of coronary artery disease as his
blood pressure tolerates.
