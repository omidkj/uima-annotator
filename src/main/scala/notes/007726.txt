instead. Patient now presents again with fever for two days

Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was diagnosed with AML in [**2123-3-7**]. She had 7+3
treatment complicated by febrile neutropenia and pneumonia. She

an outpatient. She received 4 cycles of ALFA-low dos
cytarabine/idarubicin. Her counts were slow to recover and there
was concern over MDS. Responded to neupogen injections. She
underwent a bone marrow biopsy in [**Month (only) 547**] which showed 52% blasts.
She had no circulating blasts at that time. She received her
first cycle of decitibine [**4-21**] to [**4-25**]. She tolerated treatment
well per report. On [**4-28**] she had 4% circulating blasts. This
increased to 63%. Treated with Azacitadine in [**5-15**].

[**6-27**] Blood cultures: Gram negative Rods

-[**6-27**] CXR: Enlarging left lower lobe opacity, consistent with
known invasive aspergillosis. Additional nodules are difficult
to evaluate on radiography.

-[**6-28**] CXR: Substantial progression of consolidation in and
around growing multiple lung nodules, accompanied by new left
pleural effusion consistent with active spreading infection,
more likely bacterial than fungal due to the rapid change. Mild
interstitial edema is also new, presumably reflecting interval
volume support. Heart size, however, is normal.

-[**6-28**] post intubation: ET tube tip is 7.2 cm above the carina
could be advanced couple of centimeters to standard position.
Right subclavian catheter tip is in the mid SVC. NG tube tip is
out of view below the diaphragm. Cardiomediastinal contours are
normal. There is no pneumothorax. A small left pleural effusion
is unchanged. Multifocal rounded opacities located throughout
both lungs have minimally worsened consistent with worsening
multifocal pneumonia


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a 74 y/o F with recurrent AML who was admitted
to the BMT service on [**2124-6-27**] for neutropenic fevers. She was
intially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, with zosyn and
vancomycin. Throughout her time on the floor, her blood
pressures were borderline and supported with IV fluids. She
continued to have high fevers with a max of 103F, and she had an
oxygen requirement which slowly increased to 3 liters. Follow up
CXR with her developing oxygen requirement demonstrated
multifocal pneumonia. Her blood cultures also returned within 1
day of being drawn with gram stain showing Gram negative rods.
Of note the previous week, she has been admitted with
pseudomonal bacteremia and pneumonia which was sensitive to
zosyn. The evening of [**2124-6-28**] the patient became unresponsive
while transferring from the commode to the bed and was
unresponsive. A code blue was called and she recieved chest
compressions for 3 minutes. She was intubated. The monitor was
attached about 2 minutes into chest compressions, which showed
sinus tachycardia. At that time, femoral pulse was palpated and
chest compressions were stopped, and she was transferred to the
ICU. There was a question as to what her code status was, and it
appeared that the recent decision was for her to be DNR/DNI. In
the ICU, the patient was quickly weaned off down on the vent.
She was also  hypotensive and recieved about 5L NS for treatment
of this. She passed a SBT, and was extubated. After she was
extubated the patient was lucent and interactive. Her code
status was confirmed, and she expressed the wish to not have
anything invasive done, and be DNR/DNI. She was satting well on
face mask and interactive. about an hour after being extubated,
the patient suddenly became unresonsive. Her O2 saturations
started to drift down quickly. She maintained a pulse for
several minutes. The patient was made confortable, and within
several minutes, she became asystolic as well.

Time of death was called at 3:25AM [**2124-6-29**]. MD, nurses at
bedside. patient unresponsive to tactile and verbal stimuli. no
breath or heart sounds. no pupillary reflex. patients brother
[**Name (NI) 382**] and attending notified of the death.
