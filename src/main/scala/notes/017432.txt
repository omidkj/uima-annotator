ADDENDUM TO PREVIOUS DISCHARGE SUMMARY DICTATED ON [**2110-1-29**]:
1. RESPIRATORY:
The patient remained intubated and mechanically ventilated
and continued on settings of 28/6, rate of 38 and FIO2
requirement of 29 to 40 percent.  The patient intermittently
breathed over the ventilator.  No changes in the ventilator
settings were done during his stay.

1. CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:
The patient remained hemodynamically stable.  His
echocardiogram on day 21 of life had shown moderately
depressed right ventricular function and borderline left
ventricular function.  He had a small posterior descending
coronary artery approximately 1.8 mm with continuous left to
right flow.  The patient remained on Digoxin at a dose of 10.6
mcg [**Hospital1 **].  He otherwise remained hemodynamically stable during
this period.

1. FLUID, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:
[**Doctor First Name 4051**] was on cycling total parenteral nutrition.  He was
started on entral feeds on day of life 19 with Special Care
Formula 20.  He was gradually advanced at the rate of 15 cc
B.I.D. and had reached 220 cc per kg per day of entral feeds
at the time of discharge.  His electrolytes remained stable.
The weight at the time of discharge was 2995 grams.

1. GASTROINTESTINAL:
[**Doctor First Name 4051**] had developed hyperbilirubinemia with the maximum
bilirubin of 14.1 on day four of life.  He developed a direct
hyperbilirubinemia with levels of total of 9.2 and a direct
fraction of 5.4 on day 24 of life.  He had mildly elevated
liver function tests with ALT of 249, AST of 177 and alkaline
phosphatase levels of 389 at the same time.  His repeat liver
function tests drawn on day 30 of life had showed levels of
SGOT 134, and SGPT 172, alkaline phosphatase at 528.  His
bilirubin levels remained high at the levels of 9.2 and a
direct of 5.4.  His abdominal ultrasound on [**2110-1-16**] had
shown a collapsed gallbladder.  There was no evidence of
biliary ductal dilatation.

1. HEME:
His last blood transfusion was on day 21 of life.  His last
CBC was done on day of life 24 which had shown a hematocrit
of 40, white count of 14.7 and a platelet count of 132.
[**Doctor First Name 4051**] remained mildly thrombocytopenic with platelet count
at 96 on day 30 of life.  He, however, remained stable with
no obvious episodes of bleeding and hemodynamically stable.

1. INFECTIOUS DISEASE:
[**Doctor First Name 4051**] was started on Vancomycin and cefotaxime and received
a seven day course that finished on [**2110-2-6**] for clinical
pneumonia.  His blood culture remained no growth to date.

1. NEUROLOGY:
[**Doctor First Name 4051**] was continued to be seen by neurology.  [**Doctor First Name 4051**] was
followed up on the results for his muscles, nerve and skin
biopsy which was done on [**2110-1-29**].  Preliminary staining
narrowed down his diagnosis to one of the congenital
myotonic dystrophies.  On further staining was diagnosed as
Pompe's type 2.  At the time of discharge the enzyme studies
and further staining studies by the neuro pathology was
pending.  The studies on the spinal muscular atrophy gene DNA
came out negative.  [**Doctor First Name 4051**] remained on Fentanyl drip at the
dose of 2 to 3 mcg per kg per hour until the time of
discharge.

1. GENETICS/METABOLISM:
[**Doctor First Name 4051**] had normal SR clonidine profile.  His quantitive
studies on mucopolysaccharides came out normal at the level
of 15.2 mmol.  He had negative studies for congenital
disorder for glycosylation.  His DNA study for spinal
muscular atrophy came back negative.  His urine level for
oligosaccharide, salicylic acid, SR glycine are pending at
the time of this dictation.  [**Doctor First Name 4051**] was seen by neurology based
on his muscle, nerve and skin biopsy on [**2110-1-29**].  His diagnosis
was narrowed down to congenital myotonic dystrophy.  On further
histopathology was suggestive of Pompe's disease type 2.  At the
time of this dictation his enzyme studies on those biopsies are
still pending and not likely to be completed for several weeks.


1. SENSORY:
The patient had hearing screen done bilaterally on day of
life seven and was referred for both ears.

1. PSYCHOSOCIAL:
The [**Hospital1 69**] social worker has
been involved.  The name of the social worker is [**Name (NI) 58673**]
[**Name (NI) 6861**].  She can be reached at [**Telephone/Fax (1) **].  The patient had
follow up family meetings.  These meetings were done with
other subspecialties like neurology.  [**Doctor First Name 47874**] conditions and
prognosis were discussed during these meetings.  After
extensive discussions with the family and other
subspecialties the parents directed to withdraw care on
[**2110-2-13**].

LABORATORY DATA:  Pending at the time of discharge were
myotonic dystrophy final enzyme studies and serum amino acids.
