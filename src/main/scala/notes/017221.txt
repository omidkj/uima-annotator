Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5810**]
Chief Complaint:
Post-op Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous fixation of Right acetabular column fracture

History of Present Illness:
81 F with PMH of AF on coumadin, HTN, HLD, hypothyroidism,
anxiety, depression, and IBS admitted to the ortho service with
a R acetabular fracture after a mechanical fall yesterday. She
was taken to the OR today for an ORIF. Intraoperatively, she had
bronchospasm that resolved with albuterol. Post-operatively,
when she was extaubted she had diffuse wheezing and was hypoxic
to 80's on nasal cannula. Her O2 sat increased to 93-95% on an
NRB. She was transitioned to BIPAP with increase in sats 95-97%.
CXR showed pulmonary edema. She received lasix 10mg IV, then
20mg IV with 1600cc of urine output. She is being transferred to
the ICU for pulmonary edema requiring BIPAP.

CT Pelvis:
1. Comminuted right acetabular fracture with extension into the
right iliac
[**Doctor First Name 362**] and inferior pubic ramus with adjacent hematoma. No
evidence of active
extravasation. Note that traumatic bladder injury is not
excluded and if this
is a concern clinically, would recommend further evaluation with
a CT
cystogram.
2. Atherosclerotic disease with abdominal aortic ectasia.
3. Diverticulosis.
.
CT C-Spine:
IMPRESSION: No acute fracture or traumatic malalignment. Note
that
degenerative changes with osteophyte formation slightly efface
the ventral
thecal sac, which may predispose to traumatic cord injury. If
the physical
examination of the patient is concerning for this entity, this
could be
further evaluated with MRI, if no contraindication.
.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist
.
CT Cystogram:
.
IMPRESSION:
.
1. No contrast extravasation to suggest urinary bladder rupture.

2. Extensive right acetabular fractures with adjacent hematoma,
unchanged
from the recent comparison studies.
.
[**7-16**] CXR:
REASON FOR EXAM: Desaturation, assess for aspiration or foreign
body.
.
Comparison is made with prior study [**7-14**].
 .
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable. New diffuse lung
opacities are
larger in the right upper lobe and left lower lobe. The
differential
diagnosis is broad and include massive aspiration, hemorrhage. I
doubt, this
corresponds to asymmetric pulmonary edema or contusions. There
is no
pneumothorax or large pleural effusions
.
[**7-19**] CXR AP/LAT:
IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in pulmonary vascular
congestion and
probable focal infiltrate at the left lung base.
.
ECHO [**2110-7-18**]:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with borderline normal
free wall function. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis.
The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to
increased stroke volume due to aortic regurgitation. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal systolic function. Dilated right ventricle with moderate
tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
.
[**7-22**] HIP X-RAY:
IMPRESSION: Right acetabular fracture, status post ORIF as
above. Please see recent CT for fracture details


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 108652**] is an 81-year-old woman with afib on coumadin,
HTN, HLD, IBS and had a mechanical fall on [**2110-7-14**], resulting
in a Right acetabular column fracture. The patient underwent an
ORIF of her fracture. And had post operative difficulty
ventilating in the PACU. She was transferred to the the ICU and
was treated with BIPAP.
.
1. Pulmonary Edema: Post-operatively, when she was extaubted she
had diffuse wheezing and was hypoxic to 80's on nasal cannula.
Her O2 sat increased to 93-95% on an NRB. She was transitioned
to BIPAP with increase in sats 95-97%. CXR showed pulmonary
edema. She received lasix 10mg IV, then 20mg IV with 1600 cc of
urine output. She was weaned to 4 L of nasal canula.  She was
transferred to the ICU for pulmonary edema requiring BIPAP.
.
In the ICU, the patient was further diuresed 3 boluses of 20 mg
Lasix IV and put out an additional 2 L urine.  After, she put
out 2 L of additional urine and was weaned to 3 L NC and was
saturating at 93%.  She was called out to the floor.
.
On the floor, the patient continued to tolerate weaning and was
eventually weaned off oxygen and saturated 95% on RA.  She
received one additional dose of lasix on [**7-19**] (40 mg PO) and
continued to improve.  She had a chest x-ray showing marked
improvement of her pulmonary edema. At the time of discharge she
was saturating 94% on room air.
.
2. Pneumonia: In the ICU, the patient was found to have a left
lower lobe pneumonia.  She was initially started on zosyn in the
ICU. On the floor she was changed to levofloxacin and zosyn to
cover community acquired pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia.
The patient had been in the hospital for less than 48 hours, so
she did not need to be treated f
