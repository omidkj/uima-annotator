[**2116-5-26**] PA lat cXR
IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.
.
[**2116-5-26**] tib.fib ap/lat
IMPRESSION: Extensive leg edema as noted clinically. No
subcutaneous gas or underlying osteomyelitis.
.
[**2116-5-27**] CT right LE
IMPRESSION:
1. Arteries and veins appear patent as imaged from the mid thigh
to the calf.
2. Crescentic fluid collection layering just superficial to the
medial
compartment of the thigh superficial to the fascia, measuring 8
x 1.7 x 5.2 cm. This measures as fluid density and not as acute
hematoma. This
collection is incompletely imaged on this study.
3. Large degree of skin thickening and calf edema.
4. No osseous abnormality identified.
.
[**2116-5-27**] portable CXR
IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic pathology including no edema
or pneumonia.
.
[**2116-5-28**] b/l LENIs
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right or left lower extremity deep
vein
thrombosis.
.
[**2116-6-2**] CT thorax with PO and IV contrast
IMPRESSION:Status post RF hepatic ablation with no CT evidence
for recurrent ormetastatic disease.
2. Interval development of a moderate-to-large amount of
perihepatic ascites with underlying portal
hypertension/cirrhosis.
3. New widespread multifocal ground-glass opacities in the lungs
with upper
zone predominance. Diagnostic considerations include evolving
multifocal
infectious/inflammatory process or pulmonary interstitial edema.
Continued
surveillance is recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
53M h/o HCV cirrhosis, HCC, pulmonary hypertension, and ASD, p/w
cellulitis, mild hypotension and acute hypoxia, who was intially
admitted to the MICU for acute hypoxia, and then transferred to
the floor the next day.

#Cellulitis: Patient presented with severe cellulitis of RLE,
with superficial calf ulcers as likely portal of entry. No
clinical evidence of compartment syndrome. CT RLE with no
evidence of abscess, hematoma, or DVT. No osteo on plain film.
Patient got 3 days of Vanc/Unasyn IV with improvement of
erythemia. He was then switched to 500mg TID augmentin for total
of 10 days of antibiotics. (Day 1: [**5-26**])
- CT negative for DVT, compartment syndrome, abscess,
osteomyelitis.
- bl LENI negative for DVTs
.
#Pulmonary HTN/Hypoxemia: Lungs with only minimal bibasilar
rales, CXR clear, although CT showed new widespread interstital
ground glass opacities. On 2L home O2 due to pulmonary
hypertension. Hypoxia thought to be due to combination of
pulmonary hypertension and shunting by known ASD in setting of
missed dose of sildenefil.
- Scheduled for out patient echocardiogram to evaluate for heart
failure
- Continue lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] and aldactone 100mg
- Continue Sildenafil
- continue Zonisamide
.
#Anemia: Patient received 2 units PRBCs and 1 u platelets for
HCT off of ABG of 19. On recheck was closer to baseline (24),
but did not respond appropriately to the 2 units (24->26).
Patient HCt was intially monitored [**Hospital1 **], and was stable, so was
then trended daily and remained stable throughout admission. It
was slightly lower than his baseline.
.
#Cirrhosis: Holding propranolol and spironolactone given
hypotension.
- propranolol was tapered from 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] due to
hypotension and Dr.[**Name (NI) 948**] recommendation
- Continue lasix/sprinonolactone
- Continue lactulose and rifaximin
.
#Diabetes: Likely [**1-11**] steroids.  Will require insulin at home.
