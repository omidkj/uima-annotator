Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 7749**] is an 82 year old
Caucasian male with a past medical history significant for
coronary artery disease confirmed by stress test in [**2195-1-29**] showing inferior ischemia.  Past medical history also
includes chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia and peripheral vascular disease.  He presents
with congestive heart failure, most likely secondary to
recent myocardial infarction.  The patient was admitted on
[**6-22**] for right second toe open amputation, status post
surgical procedure.  On [**2197-6-23**], the patient was found
diaphoretic, unresponsive, heartrate rhythm was in the 120s,
hypertensive, with blood pressure of 220/110, hypoxic and
electrocardiogram showing ST elevations, consistent with
acute myocardial infarction.  At that time the patient was
given oxygen, aspirin, Nitroglycerin, and Lopressor.  A
catheterization was delayed because of resolution of ST
changes with treatment.  The patient was then scheduled for
catheterization on [**6-27**], but spiked a 101.4 temperature.
He was also found to be experiencing congestive heart failure
which lead to transfer to the CCU for management.  The
patient was transferred to CCU at approximately 1500 hours.
Earlier that morning he had received 160 mg of Lasix
intravenously and found to have already emptied one liter of
fluid.  He states that he has not had any history of chest
pain, palpitations or shortness of breath.  No history of
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, no nausea, no vomiting.  He did
have a history of cough with clear sputum.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination it was found
that Mr. [**Known lastname 7749**] was moderately dehydrated evidenced by a
mottled tongue, both pupils were equally round and reactive
to light and accommodation.  There was no lymphadenopathy
noted.  His heartsounds were muffled, notable S3 noted, no
murmur, he did have a hepatojugular reflex, jugular vein
measuring 7 cm above the right atrium.  In his lungs there
were positive bibasilar crackles, no rhonchi and no wheezing.
His abdomen was soft, nontender with no palpable masses.  He,
however, did have sacral edema.  Extremities, his right leg
showed mild erythema, positive swelling, positive tenderness.
His right foot showed evidence of a second right toe
amputation, no purulent discharge noted at that time.  Both
heels showed minor ulcerations.

LABORATORY DATA:  Pertinent laboratory data revealed the
patient had a white blood cell count of 12.4, hematocrit of
35.2 and platelet count of 121.  His creatinine kinase was
342 MB 4, troponin I of .20.  His echocardiogram was found to
have an ejection fraction of 35 to 40%, left atrium and left
ventricle were normal, left ventricle wall motion mid
anteroseptal hypokinesis, basal inferior hypokinesis, aorta
normal, mitral valve normal, trivial mitral regurgitation, no
pericardial effusions.  His electrocardiogram was found to
have sinus bradycardia at the old inferior infarct,
anterolateral ST-T wave changes.  Chest x-ray was shown to
have cardiac enlargement, moderate to severe congestive heart
failure with pulmonary vascular engorgement, interstitial
edema, small bilateral pleural effusion, left greater than
right.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Stents were placed in the right coronary
artery and the patient was placed on post-catheterization
protocol medications.  He was continued on Aspirin,
Atorvastatin, oxygen saturation, heparin at 1500 units/hour
and Nitroglycerin drip.  He received three more doses of 80
mg of intravenous Lasix and was found to have diuresed 5
liters over the whole course.  He was given his Lasix and
Lipitor 10 mg per post catheterization protocol.  He was also
placed on low dose Lopressor at approximately 25 mg b.i.d.

Pulmonary - The patient's pulmonary status initially showed
pleural effusion, first in the right and then later in the
left.  The patient was placed on Flagyl for aspiration
pneumonia during unresponsive episode post surgery, and the
patient's oxygen saturation was maintained above 94%.  Most
recent chest x-ray showed no heart failure, no signs of
pneumonia.

Infectious disease - The patient was empirically treated for
fever spike, most likely secondary to skin infection.  He was
continued on Vancomycin and Levaquin which was renally dosed
at 150 mg.

Finally, we are awaiting Vascular Surgery to let us know how
long he is supposed to stay on Vancomycin and Levaquin.  He
is currently on day #14 of both.  The patient was also
placed on Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia coverage.

Renal - The patient has a history of renal insufficiency,
creatinine initially went up to 2.0 post aggressive diuresis.
Currently, after aggressive fluids were given, approximately
2 liters, the patient's creatinine is currently at baseline.

Endocrine - The patient has a history of insulin dependent
diabetes mellitus.  The patient was placed on insulin sliding
scale.  The patient currently is at one-half dose due to NPO
status.

Neurology - The patient during setting of catheterization had
an embolic cerebrovascular accident.  The patient was placed
on Plavix, Aspirin, Lipitor which basically he was already on
these medications, and they were just continued, per
Neurology consult.  The patient's blood pressure was also
maintained between 140 and 160 for two days.  He was then
allowed to get out of bed.  Physical therapy was consulted
regarding getting out of bed and exercising his right side,
initially thrombolytic therapy was opted, however, it was
determined that the patient was improving without
intervention.

Gastrointestinal - The patient is currently NPO due to
cerebrovascular accident incident.  The patient was found to
have lost cough reflex.  This is per a speech and swallow
study that was done on [**7-4**].

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient is currently
fluid-restricted.  He is NPO secondary to delayed aspiration
per speech and swallow study done on [**7-5**].  Nutrition
consult has been placed regarding tube feeds.
