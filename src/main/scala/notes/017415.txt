Admission Date:  [**2182-2-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2182-2-21**]

Service:  [**Location (un) **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old
male with a history of coronary artery disease, peripheral
vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease
and chronic atrial fibrillation who presented with a fall,
contusion and fever.  His history per [**Hospital 228**] health care
proxy, [**Name (NI) 7019**] [**Name (NI) 30420**].

The patient had an unwitnessed fall heard by Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 30420**] on
[**2-9**], and was found on the floor alert, but mildly confused.
The patient states that his confusion did not last very long.
He is generally without complaints of pain but was noted to
have poor p.o. intake.  Today, he had a second unwitnessed
but overheard fall, was alert but confused and complained of
pain in his right hand.  The patient remained confused for
hours and was thus brought to the Emergency Department.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was noted to be
febrile to 100.7 F.; he complains of increasing right hand
pain.  The patient has a small amount of pus at the bottom of
his graft that was sent for a culture.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  All that could be obtained was that alcohol
p.r.n. and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7019**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 30420**] is the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 100.7
F.; heart rate 85, ranging 82 to 95; blood pressure was
106/37; respiratory rate 18; 96 to 99% on two liters.  In
general, the patient was oriented to [**Hospital1 **] and was in
moderate distress.  Could not follow commands regularly.
HEENT was dry mucous membranes.  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  Neck supple.  Chest:  Coarse breath
sounds bilaterally.  Cardiovascular is regular rate with no
murmurs.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities
with left graft with no bruits, no pulse in graft.  Left hand
is red, tender, with sensation intact.  Right radial pulse is
palpable.

LABORATORY:  Pertinent labs on admission were lactate of 2.1.
CBC with white blood cell count 16.4 with 87% neutrophils,
zero percent bands.  Left hand x-ray showed no osteo, no
fractures.

Chest x-ray was positive for congestive heart failure and a
retrocardiac opacity.

Graft ultrasound showed no fluid pockets, no flow,
noncompressible.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITALIZATION COURSE:
1.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient had sepsis secondary to
an infected AV graft.  The patient's AV graft was removed on
[**2182-2-11**], and the patient was found to have both a clot and
an infection at the AV graft site.  This infection later
turned out to be Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.
The patient was sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit after
graft removal because of rising oxygen requirements.
Additionally, the patient's left hand film on [**2-11**] was
negative for a fracture or osteomyelitis.  The patient had an
MRI of his hand which was also negative for osteomyelitis but
positive for cellulitis and a nonspecific fluid collection
over the first and second digits.  The patient's OR graft
tissue and blood cultures last on [**2-10**], were both showing
Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.

The patient was originally treated with Vancomycin, however,
when sensitivities came back, the patient was switched to
Oxicillin 2 grams intravenously q. six.  On the 16th, the
decision was made to push Cefazolin one gram q. Hemodialysis,
because there were no sites left for a PICC line and if a
PICC line were placed, it would destroy the only AV graft
site available.

The patient had a transesophageal echocardiogram which was
negative for any vegetations during this hospitalization.
The patient also had an MRI of his left shoulder which was
negative for any osteomyelitis, however, imaging showed two
peripheral lung nodules which led to a chest CT scan which
showed multiple peripheral ill defined cavitary lesions
concerning for septic emboli.  The appropriate Infectious
Disease regimen will be Cefazolin one gram intravenous q.
Hemodialysis for a total of four weeks until [**2-/2108**].
Infectious Disease signed off and stated that no Infectious
Disease follow-up is needed at this point in time.

2.   END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE ON HEMODIALYSIS:  The patient
had his AV graft removed in the Operating Room on [**2-11**]
secondary to infection and clot.  Part of the AV graft
remains in the patient's arm.  A temporary femoral Quinton
catheter was placed in the medical Intensive Care Unit and
was later removed once a tunnel catheter was placed on [**2-18**].
The patient was to continue hemodialysis three times a week
and continue calcium acetate.  The Nephrology Service was
following throughout this hospitalization.

3.  GENERALIZED TONIC/CLONIC SEIZURES:  The patient had one
episode of a generalized tonic/clonic seizure in the setting
of sepsis.  Neurologic and Infectious Disease both stated
that his lumbar puncture was not suspicious for a meningitis.
A head CT scan was done with no acute lesion.  EEG was
non-specific.

The patient was loaded with intravenous Dilantin in the
Emergency Department and remained on Dilantin throughout the
majority of his hospitalization; however, at the end of the
hospitalization, the Dilantin was removed as Neurology
recommended no need to continue Dilantin for seizures in the
setting of sepsis.  The patient should not be given any
Ativan, Haldol and morphine given his renal failure and
increasing sedation when any of these medications are given
for his agitation.

4.  CARDIOVASCULAR / CORONARY:  The patient had coronary
artery disease status post coronary artery bypass graft.  He
had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit with peak CKs of 184 and troponin T 0.21.
The patient was started on aspirin and once arriving to the
floor was started on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor.  His
blood pressure remained less than 130/80 on the floor.

PUMP:  The patient has an ejection fraction of 20%.  An ACE
inhibitor was started once the patient arrived on the floor.
The patient was getting dialysis for weight control.  The
patient is to remain on two gram sodium diet.

RHYTHM:  The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation on
Amiodarone.  Per the patient's primary care physician the
patient is not to be anti-coagulated due to the increased
risk of bleeding and high risk of fall in this patient.

VALVES:  The patient's transesophageal echocardiogram was
negative for any endocarditis.

5.  INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient was
continued on a regular insulin sliding scale with
fingersticks consistently below 180.

6.  PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE AND FOOT INFECTIONS:  The
patient had a necrotic appearing fourth toe during this
hospitalization.  Podiatry was following for this and stated
that there was no need for surgery at this point in time.  A
foot x-ray was done which was questionable for osteomyelitis,
however, the Podiatry staff felt that this was not
osteomyelitis.  Non-invasive imaging was performed to assess
lower extremity vasculature which were normal.  The patient
is to have outpatient Podiatry follow-up in two weeks.

7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient, at one point in time, had
increased INR to 4.0 of unclear etiology.  The patient's DIC
panel was ne
