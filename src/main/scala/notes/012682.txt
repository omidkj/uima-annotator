Chief Complaint:
Transferred from an OSH for management for brain bleed

Placement of central venous catheter, arterial catheterization,
bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
HPI was obtained throught our electronic medical records. The
patient is a 79 y/o nursing home resident that had a generalized
seizure at her residence on the day of admission.  She was
ambuilatory in the morning, and later found by the nursing home
staff to be seizing on the floor.  She was taken to an OSH where
CT of the head demonstrated a left temporal lobar hemorrhage.
Rec'd 1 mg midazolam at presentation per rightward eye
deviation.
Intubated for airway protection, and transferred to BIMDC for
further management.  Arrives intubated, sedated.  Neurosurgery

patient
is a candidate for surgery.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 91198**] was admitted to the neuro-ICU for management of
her intraparenchmyal hemorrhage of the left temporal lobe. She
was initially admitted to the neurosurgical service, but later
was transferred under the care of the neurology service as there
were no obvious surgical options available. Her neurological
examination was notably poor; there was very little movement of
her right extremities, and some purposeless spontaneous
movements of her left extremities. She never followed commands
or opened her eyes spontaneously even off of propofol and other
sedative medications. At our initial family meeting, Ms.
[**Known lastname 91198**] was switched to a DNR code status based on our
discussion that she had a very poor prognosis.

There were several factors that complicated her prognosis.
- She was left intubated for several days out of concern that
given the size and location of her airway, she would not able to
protect her airway and manage her secretions.
- She was thrombocytopenic on admission (platelets 30-50K),
which required intermittent platelet transfusions to keep her
platelets above 50. She was seen by the hematology consultant
service who was able to determine through prior records that she
likely suffers from ITP, and for this, she was started on IV
steroids.
- Her hospital course was also complicated by the development of
a lobar pneumonia for which she was initiated on broad spectrum
antibiotics.
- Given her new seizure, she was placed on continuous EEG
monitoring which revealed breakthrough epileptiform activity of
the left temporal lobe, for which was loaded with and started on
IV keppra (in addition to dilantin).
- Intermittently, the patient also required IV pressors to
maintain her blood pressure, and her hypotension was thought to
be [**3-15**] medication-related.

Follow up CT scans on Ms. [**Known lastname 91198**] showed the presence of
enlarging IPH with mild compressive hydrocephalus and midline
shift. She even received a few days of osmotic therapy with
hypertonic saline and mannitol which did little to improve the
size of her bleed. Her neurological examinations continued to
remain poor. Ultimately, with the consent of the family, she was
switched to CMO status. She was terminally extubated and all of
her medications were discontinued, and was started on a morphine
drip.

On the morning of [**10-29**] at 655AM, she passed away in
the ICU. Several attempts were made to contact the son [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) **] using the only available phone number ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 91199**]).
At the time of this discharge summary, we have yet to inform the
son as he does not respond to phone messages and or answer his
phone. The decision on whether to perform an autopsy is pending.
Our attending physician was informed about her demise.
