Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
EKG changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization [**2126-4-12**]


History of Present Illness:
86 yo female with COPD, pulm HTN, TR who presented to OSH after
a stranger knocked into her at her [**Hospital3 **] facility
causing her to fall and fracture her left hip.  She did not have
any LOC.  In addition, she sustained a laceration to her right
lower leg and received 6 stiches at OSH.  At OSH, pt had CT scan
of Left hip which showed a cervical neck fracture of the left
proximal femur.  She had a routine pre-op evaluation; however
her pre-op EKG showed ST elevations in V2-V4.  The patient was
completely asymptomatic.  She denied chest pain or pressure.
Her SOB was at baseline.  She did have some nausea, vomiting and
diaphoresis at the OSH.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac cath.  Her cardiac cath earlier today showed clean
coronaries.  The patient tolerated the procedure without
complication.  The orthopedic team was consulted for management
of her hip fracture.
.
The patient denies any chest pain or pressure currently.  She
reports that she does not want to undergo hip repair despite
being informed of the risks.  She refuses to go to get x-rays
for further evaluation.
.
ROS:  She denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, or hemoptysis. She denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. Has occasional abdominal pain, alternating diarrhea and
constipation but has not had a colonoscopy, occasional blood in
stool with straining.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Past Medical History:
Pulmonary HTN
Tricuspid regurgitation
CPD
Osteoporosis c/b thoracic spine fracture resulting in chronic
mid back pain
Hypertension
h/o pyelonephritis
h/o left hydronephrosis of uncertain eitology
h/o pneumonia - required stay in rehab prior to transfer to
[**Hospital3 **]

Social History:
She lives in an [**Hospital3 **] facility at [**Location (un) 582**].  Had been
living independently until 3 months ago when she had a pneumonia
and required inpatient rehab prior to her transfer to [**Hospital 4382**].  Son is an administrator and internist at [**Hospital1 3325**].  Has 2 daughters who live locally.

smoking 3 months ago.

Cardiac Catheterization [**2126-4-12**]
1.  Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed:

--the LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease
--the LAD had no angiographically apparent disease
--the LCX had no angiographically apparent disease
--the RCA had a calcified proximal 50% stenosis.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated systemic
arterial
systolic pressures, with SBP 156 mmHg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  No obstructive CAD
2.  Moderate systemic arterial systolic hypertension.

Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is small. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with borderline normal free wall function.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure overload. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral v
