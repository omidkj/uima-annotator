HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Pneumonia:  When patient initially presented to the
hospital, patient had studies sent off for varicella zoster,
herpes simplex types I and II, [**Month/Day (1) 50508**] and Gram stain for
fungi as well as PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 50508**] of the nasal swab for viruses,
testing for Mycoplasma pneumonia by antibodies as well as by
PCR, and antibody testing for [**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] virus.  Blood
culture and urine culture as well as sputum [**Doctor Last Name 50508**] were
also sent off.  Additionally, skin biopsies of the patient's
vesicular rash was done x2 to test for varicella.  The
patient's microdata was all negative with the exception of
elevated IgM as well as elevated IgG for Mycoplasma
pneumonia.

Additionally, the first two smears of the vesicles for
varicella were negative.  Patient had a deep skin biopsy,
which was then taken which was positive for erythema
multiforme.  Patient was initially treated with Vancomycin,
acyclovir, ceftriaxone, and later changed to Vancomycin,
levofloxacin, and then later changed to azithromycin for a
total of 21 days of antibiotics.  Patient's chest x-ray by
time of completion of antibiotic regimen revealed that he had
small bilateral pleural effusions and a left middle lobe
infiltrate with resolution of the left lower lobe infiltrate.
Again, patient was maintained on antibiotics for a total of
21 days.  Otherwise, the patient had two bronchoalveolar
lavages done along with brushings, and these were completely
negative for microorganisms.

The patient also had a CT of his chest performed on [**2111-10-6**]
which was consistent with a new right middle lobe infiltrate
which was felt to be secondary to BAL of the right middle
lobe.  By the time of discharge, this infiltrate was stable.

Otherwise, patient was intubated on [**2111-9-28**], and remained
intubated until [**2111-10-19**] at which time, a trache was placed
in the OR.  Throughout his hospitalization, patient had very
thick blood-tinged expectorant from his lungs, which was felt
to initially be consistent with desquamation caused by
[**Known lastname **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome, and later given that his course
was complicated by a left lower lobe pulmonary embolus which
arose from a right upper extremity DVT, his blood-tinged
sputum was thought to be caused by supratherapeutic PTT and
airway changes from [**Initials (NamePattern4) 22721**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. By time of this discharge
summary, his sputum became nonbloody and was mostly purulent in
nature.

It should be noted that the patient had a very traumatic
intubation on [**2111-9-28**].  The anesthesiologist that performed
that intubation noted that patient's posterior pharynx was
desquamated, ulcerated, and "raw appearing".  His intubation
was complicated by pneumomediastinum as well as a small
pneumothorax on the left side.  These resolved spontaneously . It
was felt that given patient's traumatic intubation, that patient
should be extubated with trache placement on [**10-19**] in the OR
given that patient could have possible subglottic stenosis.

2. Ventilation:  Patient was initially maintained on
assist-control ventilation.  As his pulmonary examination
improved, he was maintained on pressure support ventilation
and tolerated pressure support and PEEP of 5 without any
complications.  His main limiting factors to extubation
included very thick secretions as well as the patient
becoming extremely agitated, diaphoretic, and tachypneic at
extubation.

For sedation, the patient was maintained initially on
Fentanyl and Versed, and then on propofol by time of
discharge.

3. Fevers:  Initially when patient presented, he was
afebrile, but then shortly thereafter, he had daily fevers
every hour on the hour to a max of 104.  In an effort to
search for sources of infecti
