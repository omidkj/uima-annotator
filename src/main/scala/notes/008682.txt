Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
palpitations

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
72-year-old man with a history of a nonischemic cardiomyopathy,
chronic atrial fibrillation, on dofetilide for prior ventricular
tachycardia in [**2196**], with ICD placed in [**2193**], p/w palpatations
to the OSH found to be in VT started on amiodarone. Per report,
he was walking in the mall with his wife, felt sudden onset of
palp associated with dyspnea, sweating, and presyncope for
approximately 15mins prior to calling EMS. Per OSH records, he
was initially noted to be in afib with rate in 80s, then
developed afib with RVR. Palpitations recurred and noted to be
in monomorphic VT with rate ranging from 160 to 180s, BP was
stable. He was given 150 mg of amiodarone. At OSH, he was placed
on amio gtt (.99 mg/min), heparin gtt (1000 u/hour) and given
ASA. He was noted to be in intermittent VT lasting 45-60 secs.
His ICD did not fire during these episodes.
.
Patient denies any f/c/n/v/d. Only recent change was he stopped
coumadin this past [**Year (4 digits) **] for lipoma removal. Of note, last
month he had b/l inguinal repair which was uncomplicated. He had
his device interogated over the phone about 3 weeks ago.
Otherwise, no other medications changes and is compliant. Per
pt, digoxin was recently increased - unclear dose.
.
In ED, he was noted to be in stable condition, mentating
appropriately. Though his heart rate fluctuated anywhere from 70
to 130's with baseline rhythm in afib. Pacer was interrogated
notable for VVI, VF > 250, FVT > 200, VT monitor for > 150,
atrial pace at 40. Notable for multiple episode of VT today
longest around 10mins.

4. Ventricular tachycardia status post appropriate ICD shock on

[**2196-5-21**], currently on dofetilide.  At that time, he was

CXR [**9-19**]: FINDINGS: AP upright and lateral views of the chest
were obtained. An abandoned pacer lead extends from the right
chest wall into the expected location of the right ventricle. An
AICD device projects over the left chest wall with lead tip
terminating in the expected location of the right ventricle.
There is stable appearance of marked cardiomegaly. There is no
gross sign of CHF or pneumonia. No pneumothorax or evidence of
pleural effusion seen. Bones appear grossly intact.

IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly without evidence of pneumonia or CHF.

Echo [**9-20**]:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with severe cavity dilation and severe global hypokinesis (LVEF
= 20 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely
more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is markedly dilated with with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant
pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic
regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery
diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Biventricular cavity enlargement and global
hypokinesis c/w diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, multivessel
CAD, etc.). Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation. Pulmonary artery hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 YOM w/ h/o ischemic CM, chronic Afib, VT on dofetilide, with
ICD, presents with palptations, found to be in Afib, developed
Afib with RVR, then developed VT.

# Ventricular Tachycardia - The patient was initially on a
heparin gtt from the OSH for concern of ACS.  This was d/c'd the
following morning.  He was seen by Electrophysiology in the ED
and was started on an amiodarone drip which broke his
tachycardia and left him in atrial fibrillation with RVR.  He
was started on metoprolol tartrate 50mg [**Hospital1 **], which kept him well
rate controlled, with rates from 60-80s.  He was able to be
transitioned off the amiodarone drip to amiodarone 400mg PO TID
and remained in slow a fib.  He was discharged on metoprolol
succinate 75m PO BID.  He was hemodynamically stable throughout
his hospitalization.  His ICD was reprogrammed to the following
parameters:
1. VT > 162 bpm changed from monitor only to ATP x 2 sequencys
at 88% --> 84%.
2. FVT > 250 bpm ATP --> shock - no change
3. VF > 200 bpm ATP --> shock - no change

# Atrial fibrillation - After conversion out of ventricular
tachycardia, the patient was in slow atrial fibrillation.  He
was rate controlled with metoprolol tartrate 50mg [**Hospital1 **] while in
house, then switched to succinate as above on discharge.  His
coumadin was decreased to 2.5mg daily due to the interaction
with amiodarone.  His INR was 1.4 on discharge.  He was
instructed to have an INR drawn on [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**9-22**] and then
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4469**] for Coumadin changes.

# Non-ischemic cardiomyopathy - The patient had an
echocardiogram performed which showed the results below:

Biventricular cavity enlargement and global hypokinesis c/w
diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, multivessel CAD, etc.).
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe
tricuspid regurgitation. Pulmonary artery hypertension.

His dose of digoxin was decreased to 125mcg daily due to
interaction with amiodarone.  A digoxin level was dr
