CHIEF COMPLAINT:  GI bleed.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62 year old white male
with an extensive past medical history significant for
coronary artery disease requiring coronary artery bypass
graft, history of inferior myocardial infarction, status post
St. Jude valve for mitral valve prolapse in [**2169**], AICD for
ventricular tachycardia, CHF with EF of 25%, history of CVA,
history of ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, abdominal
aortic aneurysm, chronic renal insufficiency, occluded left
RA, peripheral vascular disease, history of recent lower GI
bleed.  Lower GI bleed occurred in [**2172-10-8**] when during
colonoscopy it was found that he had a cecal arteriovenous
malformation.  He had been recently admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] for interrogation of his AICD.  He
most recently had a lower GI bleed treated at [**Hospital6 3426**].  He was readmitted to [**Hospital6 33**] on
[**11-28**] for pulmonary edema.  He was diuresed and his
symptoms resolved.  However, during that admission he
developed dark diarrhea with a slow drop in his hematocrit.
There he had two negative CKs and troponins, but he was sent
to [**Hospital1 69**] for further workup of
his GI bleed and further treatment.  At [**Hospital1 190**] the patient initially had no complaints.  He
was given two units of FFP and then was given a bowel prep
with GoLYTELY.  While receiving GoLYTELY, he developed chest
pain on his way to the bedside commode.  Chest pain resolved
with two sublingual nitroglycerin and IV metoprolol.  He also
had brown reddish appearance to his bowel movements.  He had
another episode of [**8-17**] chest pain without radiation to his
neck.  It did not resolve initially with two sublingual
nitroglycerin.  However, he ruled out for coronary ischemia.
He received 81 mg of aspirin and 5 mg of IV metoprolol.  He
also complained of headache and flushing.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post
inferior MI in [**2147**], status post coronary artery bypass graft
times two in [**2169**].  CABG involved LIMA to LAD and saphenous
vein graft to posterior descending artery.  Mitral valve
replacement with St. Jude valve in [**2169**].  Ventricular
tachycardia status post dual chamber AICD in [**2167**] for
ventricular tachycardia and bradycardia.  History of
inducible VT with old inferior scars.  Status post multiple
admissions.  CHF with EF of 25%.  Epilepsy.  Stroke involving
left middle cerebral artery.  Diverticulitis.  Benign
prostatic hypertrophy status post TURP.  History of gastritis
H.pylori positive.  Cholelithiasis.  Ulcerative colitis
diagnosed in [**2128**].  Abdominal aortic aneurysm which is 3 to
3.5 mm in diameter.  Status post appendectomy in [**2120**].
Occluded left renal artery most likely with chronic renal
insufficiency with creatinine of 2.5 to 3.  Peripheral
vascular disease.  Lower GI bleed which last occurred in
[**2172-10-8**].  At that time he was found to have cecal
arteriovenous malformation.  He had two polyps removed.  He
also had diverticulitis.

ALLERGIES:  ACE inhibitor which causes angioedema.  Codeine
and shellfish which cause hives.  Contrast dye and iodine to
which he also has reactions.

MEDICATIONS:  Hydralazine 75 mg p.o. t.i.d., amiodarone
200 mg p.o. q.d., Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d., Klonopin 0.5 mg
p.o. b.i.d., Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d., folate 1 mg p.o. q.d.,
Mysoline 250 mg p.o. q.d., Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
carvedilol 0.125 mg p.o. b.i.d., furosemide 80 mg p.o.
b.i.d., multivitamin, Norvasc 2.5 mg q.d., Imdur 30 mg p.o.
q.d. which had been discontinued because of headache,
Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d. which was also discontinued.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate was 78, blood pressure
162/76, sating 97% on 2 liters, respiratory rate 20.  In
general, he was in moderate distress with chest pain, but
alert and oriented.  Pupils were equal, round and reactive to
light.  Extraocular movements were intact.  Moist mucous
membranes.  Oropharynx was clear.  Tongue was midline.  Heart
regular rate and rhythm, S1 mechanical sound above apex, 2/6
systolic murmur without radiation.  Lungs were limited to the
anterior.  He was found to have crackles.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities had 2 to 3+ peripheral edema, warm, no cyanosis
or clubbing.  Dorsalis pedis pulse was palpable.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count was 8.8, 82.5 neutrophils, 10
lymphocytes, 5 monocytes, 2 eosinophils, 5 basophils,
hematocrit 24.9, platelets 127.  Sodium was 141, potassium
3.9, chloride 108, bicarb 24, BUN 46, creatinine 2.2, glucose
99.  CK was 54.  INR was 2.7, PTT 26.2.  UA was yellow, clear
with specific gravity of 1.010, trace protein.  EKG showed
normal sinus rhythm at 93 beats per minute with normal axis,
ST depressions and T wave inversions in aVL, 1, aVF, 2, V4,
V6.  Positive for left ventricular hypertrophy by voltage
criteria.  When he became chest pain free, he had less
prominent T wave inversions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was a 62 year old white male
with multiple medical problems who had a GI bleed complicated
by ischemic changes on his EKG.

1.  Cardiac.  His chest pain, along with the EKG changes, was
thought to be secondary to his anemia.  He has a history of
chest pain with hematocrit decreases below 30.  Consequently
the treatment in this situation was for blood transfusion.
However, because of his congestive heart failure and clinical
evidence of pulmonary edema, the blood transfusion would have
to be closely monitored.  He required furosemide between each
unit.  Because of his anemic situation, his antihypertensives
were held.  His cardiac enzymes were cycled and were
negative.  Troponin was 0.4.  CKs were 43, 45 and 102.  No
CKMB fractions were done on those CKs.  Because of the
setting of his acute GI bleed, aspirin was held.  The goal
was to keep his hematocrit above 30.  On the second day of
admission he had chest pain after having hematochezia.  He
had ST depressions on his EKG.  At that time nitroglycerin
drip was started.  He also received metoprolol IV, morphine
and aspirin.  He was also diuresed with 40 mg of IV Lasix.
Because of his cardiac issues, he was continued on
nitroglycerin drip along with metoprolol 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
He was also started on hydralazine 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. for
afterload reduction.  His INR had initially been elevated at
2.6.  Consequently because of his GI bleed, it was decided to
discontinue Coumadin.  Heparin was then started.  However,
after he had hematochezia associated with chest pain, heparin
was also discontinued.  He had been actually hypertensive
with blood pressure between 140s and 200s despite probable
bleeding from the GI tract.  Hydralazine was continued and
increased eventually to 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.

He had colonoscopy done on [**2172-12-2**].  Thereafter he
was started on heparin and aspirin.  Metoprolol was increased
to 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.  Because he had been placed on
carvedilol as an outpatient, he was then switched over to
carvedilol 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.  It was then increased to
25 mg p.o. b.i.d.  However, these events occurred after his
colonoscopy.  He was also started on amlodipine and Imdur.
Imdur was started at 30 mg p.o. q.d.  Norvasc was started at
10 mg p.o. q.d.  He continued to be diuresed because of his
congestive heart failure.  He required 80 mg IV b.i.d.  This
was transitioned to 80 mg p.o. b.i.d. which was his dose
taken at home.  Daily weights were measured.  His edema
improved gradually over time.  He was transferred to the
floor on [**2172-12-3**].  He had some nonsustained v-tach.
However, his AICD was interrogated and it was found to be
working well.  He was continued on heparin for his mitral
valve replacement.  It was debated whether to start low
molecular weight heparin.  However, it was decided that he
would be started on Coumadin.  GI Fellow was consulted about
this.  They felt that the risk of bleeding would be low after
having intervention so subsequently he was started on
Coumadin 5 mg p.o. on [**2172-12-6**].  He will need to be
continued on Coumadin wi
