Service:  NEONATOLOGY

HISTORY:  This is the 1.315 kg product of a 28 [**1-9**] week twin
gestation, born to a 27-year-old GI P0-II mother.  Prenatal
screens notable for maternal blood type A positive, antibody
surface antigen negative, group B strep unknown.  This is a
Ultrasound at 23 weeks showed size discordance, attributed to
twin-twin transfusion syndrome.  Subsequent ultrasound showed
increasing oligohydramnios but good biophysical profiles.
The mother completed steroid therapy.  These patients were
delivered by cesarean section.  Twin I emerged apneic but
minutes.

1.  Respiratory:  The child was intubated and given 2
doses of surfactant, and rapidly weaned to CPAP and then
nasal cannula.  Intermittently the child had to go back on
CPAP for increased spelling.  He was started on caffeine and
subsequently weaned onto nasal cannula on DOL #16 and onto RA on
DOL#34. He is currently on caffeine.  He has occasional spells.

2.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  He was initially
nil by mouth and started on intravenous fluids.  His
feeds were advanced as tolerated .He is currently tolerating
150 cc/kg of PE28 with ProMod po/pg.

3.  Infectious Disease:  The patient had started antibiotics.
Culture were negative at 48 hours, and these were
discontinued.  When he had increased spells, repeat CBC and
blood cultures were done, but no further antibiotics were
started.  He is currently off all antibiotic therapy.

4.  Cardiovascular:  He never required blood pressure
support, although he did have a murmur and was given a course
of indomethacin.  His murmur persisted.  An echocardiogram
was performed, which showed that he had a mild biventricular
outflow obstruction, probably secondary to hypovolemia, but
no structural heart disease and no duct. Repeat ECHO on DOL#28
revealed improved but mild biventricular hypertrophy, which will
need to be followed as an outpatient at the Cardiology Clinic.

5.  Hematology:  He received a blood transfusion of 50 cc/kg
since his hematocrit was relatively low and his
echocardiogram was consistent with hypovolemia.  He did
require phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia, however, at this
time, he is off of phototherapy, with normal bilirubin
levels.

6.   Neurology: HUS on [**10-15**] and [**10-23**] were within normal limits
Follow up HUS on [**2177-11-13**] revealed caudothalamic groove cyst

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: He is 2.170kg, he is non-dysmorphic.
His cardiac examination shows a II/VI systolic murmur, regular
rate and rhythm.  His lung examination is clear bilaterally.
His abdomen is soft and nondistended.  The rest of his physical
examination is within normal limits.

CONDITION AT THE TIME OF THIS SUMMARY:  Stable.

FOLLOW UP
1. Paediatric Cardiology in mid [**Month (only) **] to F/U biventricular
hypertrophy- parents will need to call for appointment
2. ROP screen on [**2177-11-19**]

MEDICATION
Caffeine 15mg po/pg qd
Vit E 5 IU po/pg qd
Ferrinsol 0.15cc po/pg qd

DIAGNOSIS LIST:
1.  Prematurity
2.  Status post twin-twin transfusion
3.  Mild apnea of prematurity
4.  Status post rule out sepsis
5.  Mild biventricular hypertrophy
6.  Right subependymal cysts with resolved bilateral germinal
matrix haemorrhages
