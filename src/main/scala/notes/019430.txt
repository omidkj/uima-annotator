Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
Low back pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CT guided drainage of psoas abscess
TEE


History of Present Illness:
77 yo F w/ AF, htn, "enlarged heart," DM, hx UTI, multiple joint
replacements, who transferred from [**Hospital **] w/ 1 week LBP (l-s
and R paraspinal), nausea. UA + started on abx several days ago.
l-s neg, CT abd w/o contrast showed no kidney stones. ESR [**Hospital 66783**] so transferred for concern of epidural abscess. Pt
neuro intact. MR revealed no epidural abscess and CT abdomen
revealed small right psoas phlegmon.  Based on the initial
admission imaging, radiology felt fluid collection too small and
not amenable to percutaneous drainage.  Also of note sodium as
outpatient had been 124 2 days prior to admission per PCP's
office.

ROS:  Upset stomach [**2-28**] darvocet she recieved at [**Hospital **].

In ED, patient recieved vancomycin 1gram IV, cipro 250mg X 1,
ativan 1mg, atenolol 50mg PO X 1, dig 0.125mg X1, lasix 20mg PO
X 1.

Pertinent Results:
ECG:  AF at 76, LVH, incomplete LBBB, digoxin effect
.
[**4-27**] CXR:
Bibasilar atelectasis. Pneumonia is not excluded. Comparison
with previous radiographs might be helpful in narrowing the
differential diagnosis.
Cardiomegaly.
Status post right glenohumeral joint arthroplasty.
.
[**4-27**] MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1093**]:  Multilevel degenerative changes with severe
stenosis of left neural foramina at L5-S1 level. No evidence of
epidural abscess, discitis or osteomyelitis. Focal area of
inflammation/infection is suspected at the right psoas muscle at
L1 level for which further evaluation with abdominal CT is
recommended if clinically indicated.
.
[**4-27**] Abd/Pelvic CT:  Small right psoatic phlegmon.
1. Small (8 x 16 mm) barely perceptible heterogeneity in the
right psoas muscle, without discernable fluid collection.
Infecious etiology should be considered. No associated bony
destruction or extension into the spinal canal.
2. Small amount retroaortic soft tissue which [**Known firstname **] be related to
anasarca, but paraaortic fibrosis [**Known firstname **] also be considered.
3. Fatty liver.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with
associated compressive atelectasis.
5. Coronary vascular and valvular calcifications.
6. Right total hip prosthesis.
7. Cardiomegaly.
.
[**4-29**] Transthoracic ECHO:
There is moderate to severe aortic stenosis with a mild decrease
in LV
function.
No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis.
Would recommend a TEE if clinically indicated
.
[**4-30**] Xray Hips: No evidence for prosthetic loosening; baseline
films not available for comparison.
.
[**4-30**] CT chest:
1) Diffuse ground-glass opacities in both lungs with septal
thickening, likely due to hydrostatic pulmonary edema.
2) Few scattered small nodules in both lungs in the presence of
a left hilar calcified lymph node, likely the sequelae of prior
granulomatous infectious exposure. There appearance is not
suggestive of septic emboli. However, if clinical suspicion for
pulmonary infection persists, short-term followup CT [**Known firstname **] be
helpful to exclude active infection.
3) Interval increase in the bilateral moderate pleural
effusions.
4) Slight interval increase in the prominent retrocrural soft
tissue density. This likely represents extension of the
infectious/inflammatory changes seen in the right and possibly
left psoas. There is no CT evidence of osteomyelitis.
5) Stable cardiomegaly
.
[**5-2**] Transesophageal ECHO -
Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium, left atrial appendage and
body of the right atrium.The left and left atrial appendage
emptying velocities are depressed (<0.2m/s),  but no thrombus is
seen. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color  Doppler.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are moderately thickened. Aortic
stenosis is present (not quantified) No masses or vegetations
are seen on the aortic valve. Trace  aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened.  There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets with
aortic stenosis and trace aortic regurgitation. Thickened mitral
leaflets with mild mitral  regurgitation. No discrete vegetation
or abscess identified. Poor LAA and RAA  ejection velocities
with spontaneous echo contrast in both atria.
.
[**5-2**] MRI L spine -
Please note that today's examination has axial images which span
the thoracolumbar junction and extend from roughly T10 through
L4.
Compared to the previous examinations, there has been the
development of numerous ring-enhancing masses in both psoas
muscles and in the paraaortic retroperitoneal space of the lower
thoracic region. This is consistent with progressive infection.
Paraaortic abnormality is noted as superiorly as T10, though the
most superior extent of this abnormality is not included on
these scans. Psoas abscesses are throughout the visualized
portions of the musculature, down to roughly the L3 level.
There are no signs of an enhancing intraspinal mass or epidural
collection to indicate spread of infection into the intraspinal
space. Visualized vertebrae and discs are of grossly normal
signal intensity. There are no signs of osteomyelitis at this
time.
IMPRESSION: Worsening of a paraspinal infection with multiple
enlarging abscesses around the thoracic aorta and in the psoas
muscles.
.
[**5-3**] CT guided aspiration -
1. Uncomplicated CT-guided aspiration of left periaortic
abscess.
2. Psoas abscess aspiration was not attempted due to poor
visualization by contrast-enhanced CT scan.
.
[**5-4**] CTA Torso -
1. Slight interval enlargement of left para-aortic
retroperitoneal collection, which is slightly hyperdense at the
biopsy site, suggesting possible small hematoma at the biopsy
site. Right para-arotic collection is stable. These collections
engulf the aorta, as seen on recent MRI.
2. Psoas abscesses not well demonstrated; better assessed on
MRI.
2. No evidence of aortic dissection.
3. Bibasilar opacities, probably atelectasis, and effusions.
4. Similar evidence of fluid overload.
.
[**5-8**] MRI T/L Spine
Compared to the prior exam, there has been progressive
infection. The paraaortic abnormality is noted superiorly at the
T9 vertebrae, the most superior extent of the axial images on
this examination. Nonenhancing portions of this fluid collection
[**Known firstname **] represent a hemorrhage as the patient is status post
drainage. Multiple psoas abscesses are again noted, not
significantly changed in number or size.
Of note is increased enhancement of the T12/L1 disc on STIR
images with abnormal signal a
