Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain s/p cath with LAD stent

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
61 yo M with boderline hyperlipidemia and chronic prostatitis
who initially presented to [**Hospital3 51058**] with 24 hours of
intermittent substernal chest pain occurring at rest. No prior
h/o CAD. ECG revealed [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in the precordial leads
with q waves in V2-V4. CK 1782, MB 368, TropI 28.11. He received
Morphine, Nitropaste [**2-12**] inch, lovenox 105 mg SC, ASA 325 mg,
and lopressor 5 mg IV and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath. In
our [**Name (NI) **], pt received SL NTG, Plavix 300 mg, Morphine 2 mg IV x1,
Lipitor 80, and was started on a integrilin gtt at 200 mcg/min.

.
In the cath lab he was found to have a proximal LAD total
occlusion with bare metal stent placement. Diag was dilated.
Clot remained in the distal apex of the LAD post stent
placement. LMCA without obstructive disease, LCx with 70%
proximal lesion, RCA without obstructive disease. Right groin
closed with angioseal. Post cath he was hemodynamically stable
without chest pain or SOB. He was started on an integrilin gtt
and given an additional plavix load of 300 mg.
.
Currently he denies CP, shortness of breath, nausea, fever,
chills, or belly pain. He notes back pain that started while
lying flat in the ambulance. Pain is unchanged since the cath.

Past Medical History:
- borderline hyperlipidemia
- chronic prostatitis


Social History:
Denies Tob, EtOH, or Illicit drug use. Married; lives with his
wife [**Name (NI) 382**]; [**Telephone/Fax (1) 72500**]). Works as a quality manager.

[**4-7**] CT abdomen/pelvis

IMPRESSION:
1. Areas of stranding and small hematoma noted adjacent to
right-sided common femoral puncture site. No
retroperitoneal/intrapelvic bleed identified.
2. Cholelithiasis.
3. Fat containing left inguinal hernia.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion.
.
[**4-7**] C Cath
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
shows 3
vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA has no
angiographically
apparent lesions.  The proximal LAD was 100% occluded.  The pLCx
has a
70% lesion.  The rest of the LCx including a moderate sized OM1
is
without significant disease.  The RPDA has a 80% stenosis at the
origin.
2.  Limited resting hemodynammic measurement shows normal
central
arterial pressure (128/65mmHg)
3.  Left ventriculography was not performed due to concerns
about
contrast load.  Non-invasive assessment of the LV function will
be
performed.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute MI
.
[**4-10**] CXR PA/Lat
xLung volumes remain low. Heart size and pulmonary vascularity
are within normal limits. Bibasilar patchy and linear opacities
show slight interval improvement and favor atelectasis over an
infectious pneumonia. Small pleural effusions are noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. Improving bibasilar opacities, likely due to atelectasis.
Pneumonia is less likely.
2. Small pleural effusions.
.
[**4-8**] ECHO
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to distal anterior,
septal and apical hypokinesis No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is moderately dilated athe sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 61 yo M with boderline hyperlipidemia who presented to
[**Hospital3 51058**] with 24 hours of intermittent chest pain found
to have total occlusion of proximal LAD s/p bare metal stent now
spiking fevers.
.
#  Cardiac:
a.  Ischemia.  Anterior STEMI s/p LAD stent.
- CKs trending down, peaked at 1831
- continue plavix and aspirin
- continue Metoprolol to 25 [**Hospital1 **]
- consider adding ACEI if BP tolerates as an outpatient
- start atorvastatin 80 mg; lipid panel good; LFTs abnormal but
trending down
.
b. Pump.  CXR pre-cath with mild pulmonary edema.  Hemodynamics
not done in cath lab.
- echo showed EF 35-40% with antero-sepatal hypokinesis
- start coumadin 5mg qhs
- repeat echo 3 months
- Stress-MIBI in 2 wks.
.
c. Rhythm.  Currently in sinus.  Increase B-B as HR tolerates.
.
#  Back Pain.  Likely MSK secondary to lying flat.
- tylenol prn

#  Fever. Blook cx pending.  UA pending.  Pt states he has a h/o
prostatitis for which he had made an appointment with his PCP
before the [**Name9 (PRE) **].  He usually takes cipro x 2 weeks.  CXR with
small bilateral pleural effusions.
- empiric course of cipro for prostatitis X 2 wks
