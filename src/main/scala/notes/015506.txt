History of Present Illness:
74 year old female with very limited past
medical history, who was transferred here from the OSH with
abdominal pain and CT scan concerning for free intraabdominal
air. Patient reports abdominal pain that started at 5 pm
tonight,
about 6 hours ago. The pain was located in the low abdomen/
pelvis. It did not radiate. Initially, it felt as constipation,
perhaps a need to pass flatus. The pain worsened and patient
started experiencing some sweats. There was no nausea or
vomiting. It remained in the same area. Patient has been having
regular bowel movements [**2-10**] a day. No constipation or diarrhea.
She denies any melena or hematochezia. Patient has never had a
colonoscopy or any abdominal operations. She denies any fevers.

Of note, patient reports chronic cough, which occurs several
times during the day. It is especially bad after she gets out of
bed. The cough is non-productive. She denies any shortness or
breath or chest pain. She has been taking omeprazole many years
ago, yet she did not think that it was helping and thus stopped
it. She restarted omeprazole 2 months ago, still feels it gas
not
been helping and her cough has persisted.

IMAGING:
[**8-4**]: CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis
1. Large defect in the colon within the pelvis at suspected
level of surgical anastomosis. There is a large pocket of
extra-luminal gas and fluid noted within the pelvis with
inflamed peritoneum. Persistent pneumoperitoneum.
2. Multiple indeterminate bilateral pulmonary nodules. Interval
follow-up in three months recommended to ensure stability.
3. Bilateral compressive atelectasis and pleural effusions are
noted, right greater than left, which have increased slightly
since prior CT [**2193-7-28**].
[**8-6**]: CXR (AP)
Bibasilar atelectasis. No PTX
[**8-7**]: CXR (AP)
Slight interval progression of pulmonary edema. Small amount of
b/l pleural effusion.
[**8-7**]: CXR (AP)
Hazy opacification of R mid & lower lung zones best explained by

slight increase in the moderate R pleural effusion & basal
atelectasis demonstrated by the torso CT on [**8-4**]. Pulmonary
vasculature more distended today, indicating [**Hospital1 **]-vent failure
and/or volume overload. [**Month (only) 116**] be very mild edema developing in L
mid lung.
[**8-8**]: CXR (AP)
Interval increase of R pleural effusion & unchanged appearance
of L pleural effusion, much smaller. Bibasilar opacities might
represent atelectasis, but infectious process is possible.
[**8-9**]: CXR (AP)
Moderate-to-large R pleural effusion, increased since [**8-7**];
Pulmonary vasc. congestion persists. Small L pleural effusion is
presumed.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Acute Care team and taken to the
operating room on [**7-19**] for laparoscopy converted to laparotomy
with sigmoid colon resection and primary anastomosis.
Postoperatively she recovered in the PACU and once stabilized
was transferred to the regular nursing unit. Over the course of
her stay on the regular unit her bowel function was very slow to
return. She was given trials of sips to clears and the regular
diet and was unable to tolerate these meals. She complained of
intermittent nausea throughout as well. On [**7-24**] she underwent CT
scan of he abdomen as there was concern for anastomosis leak;
results revealed free air and free fluid within the abdomen,
more than expected at postoperative day #5, with air-fluid
levels and enlarged intrapelvic fluid collection measuring up to
8.7 cm in diameter; findings are concerning for leak or
perforation. Also noted incidentally were numerous pulmonary
nodules, measuring up to 8 mm in diameter which warrants
close follow up with CT within three months. She underwent
ultrasound guided drainage of the fluid collection where an 8
French [**Last Name (un) 2823**] catheter was placed within the pelvic collection.
 Approximately 150 mL of greenish stool was aspirated and
samples were sent for microbiology growing PSEUDOMONAS
AERUGINOSA. She was started on IV antibiotics which were
continued for 2 weeks. These were stopped on [**2193-8-20**]. She will
be discharged with the JP drain in place and will follow up in
Acute Care Clinic in [**2-10**] weeks to determine if it can be
removed. Her staples were taken out on [**8-20**].

The patient was transferred to the ICU on [**2193-8-7**] with concerns
for sepsis.
Initially the patient's SBP decreased as well as her UOP. She
received multiple boluses with little improvement. Bedside ECHO
was performed that showed no obvious wall motion abnormalities
and she was euvolemic. Central line was placed to measure CVPs,
which ranged 12-15. On [**8-8**], the patient was started on trophic
tube feeds. Patient continued to be on pressors due to low blood
pressure. On [**8-9**], the patient's propofol was stopped and
switched to midazolam and intermittent fentanyl. Levophed was
weaned off and tube feeds were advance and well tolerated. A CXR
was performed that showed patient was wet, so Lasix was given
with good effet. She was started on a Lasix gtt on [**8-10**] due to
volume overload, and she continued to diurese well. On [**8-11**], the
patient was extubated and Lasix gtt was stopped. On [**8-12**],the
patient was transferred back to the floor in stable condition.

Her mental status was concerning after transfer out of the ICU,
she remained quite lethargic and delirious for a couple of days.
Her narcotics were decreased and use was limited. Tylenol and
Ultram were started for pain control which seemed to help with
improvement of her mental status.

A Dobbhoff was placed and tube feedings were initiated but
unfortunately she self discontinued the Dobbhoff on the day
after it was placed. Speech evaluated her at bedside and
recommended that she have thickened liquids with pureed solids.
At this point the screening process for LTAC was initiated. She
was accepted at a facility of her choice and arrangements were
made for discharge. On day that she was to leave she was noted
with 3 small episodes of bilious emesis; a KUB was done showing
multiple dilated air-filled loops of small bowel in a
nonspecific pattern. She was made NPO and her IV fluids were
restarted. Her ostomy continue to be functional throughout this.
An NG tube was placed and she remained NPO for a couple of days
until the nausea resolved. Once no further nausea her tube feeds
were restarted and she was able to tolerate them.

She has had several episodes of desaturation during the night
time with shortness of breath. CXR consistent with bilateral
pleural effusions and pulmonary edema. She received IV Lasix
with adequate response and was started on standing IV Lasix 20
mg IV tid initially and just changed to [**Hospital1 **] dosing on day of
discharge. Her exams will need to be followed closely and
adjustments will need to be made for ongoing diuresis. She does
continue to have a nasal oxygen requirement.
