Pertinent Results:
[**2157-8-21**] CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST 1. Increased large bowel dilation
from the cecum to the junction of the descending and sigmoid
colon, with transition point noted in the left lower quadrant at
the junction of the sigmoid colon with the descending colon, in
a region which has been chronically inflammed by diverticulitis
as noted on prior studies. Additionally, at the transition
point, there is an intramural sinus tract/abscess containing air
and fluid, measuring up to 2-cm. Findings are compatible with an
inflammatory colonic stricture from prior diverticulitis
resulting in upstream large bowel obstruction. Please note that
an underlying colonic mass is considered unlikely given recent
negative
colonoscopy in 6/[**2156**]. 2. Normal small bowel. 3. No free air or
pneumatosis. 4. Trace intrapelvic free fluid, new since the [**7-13**], [**2156**] examination. 5. Status post distal pancreatectomy and
splenectomy, with left upper quadrant splenosis. 6. Status post
prostatectomy with unchanged left pelvic side wall soft tissue
nodule which remains suspicious for recurrence. 7. Unchanged
4-mm left lower lobe nodule.

[**8-25**] AXR: dilated loops of small bowel with air in the colon

[**8-25**] Barium Enema: No gross contrast extravasation.

[**8-27**] ECHO: EF 40%, ascending aorta is mildly dilated. AV leaflets
mildly thickened

[**8-29**] CT A/P: Moderate volume ascites, more dense fluid pelvis.
Tiny focus of extraluminal density is noted near anastomosis -
leak.

[**8-30**] IR US: Feculent material drained

[**9-2**] Echo: mild LVH, EF>55%, no vegetations seen on valves

[**9-3**] CT torso: marked interval decrease in intra-abdominal fluid
collection, left basilar atelectasis, left pleural effusion

[**9-4**] RUE U/S: Prelim- DVT in basillic/ axillary not traveling to
IJ

[**9-7**] CT A/P, CTA chest - Segmental PE in the right upper and
middle lobe. Bilateral lower lobe, left greater than right
atelectasis and given heterogeneity, likely superimposed small
amount of aspiration or infection. Segmental bronchiolar
secretion/mucus plugging in the right lower lobe. New
pneumatosis in dilated loops of bowel in the right upper
quadrant without bowel wall thickening at these sites,
mesenteric or portal venous gas. This may be benign pneumatosis
in thisopatient on steroids and ventilated, but correlation and
follow up to exclude ischemix injury is recommended. Similar
overall appearance of non-loculated ascites, slight decrease in

the left lower quadrant fluid despite left mid abdominal pigtail
catheter
being partially withdrawn

[**9-7**] RUQ US: gallstones inside contracted GB, no evidence of
cholecystitis

[**9-8**] Echo: LVEF>55%, AV and MV leaflets are mildly thickened.

[**9-8**] Ext US: Right brachial vein contains echogenic material

[**9-12**] Liver US: Gallstones, cavernous transformation of the
portal vein and perihepatic ascites as previously shown on [**9-7**].


[**9-13**] CXR: Complete whiteout of L hemithorax.

[**9-28**] Chest, Abd, Pelvic CT: 1. Bilateral lower lobe pleural
effusions with adjacent atelectasis and bronchial plugging.
Right lower lobe heterogeneity of enhancement in regions of
atelectasis may result from regions of superimposed infection or
infarction. 2. Segmental PE in the right upper and middle lobes
remains unchanged in comparison to prior study. Filling defect
in the right IJ vein may represent residual fibrin sheath from
prior catheter. 3. Left-sided peritoneal enhancement along the
retroperitoneal lining which may be representative of infection
or inflammation, without loculated abscess. 4. Vague
heterogeneity in hepatic density - some of which may relate to
sequellae from previously described microabscesses, suggest
attention on followup or further characterization by MRI if
indicated. 5. Residual left hydropneumothorax with pigtail
catheter in situ.

[**10-9**] CXR: LLL and/or consolidation unchanged. Question
layering left effusion. Patchy opacity in right cardiophrenic
region slightly worse. Dobbhoff tube unlikely to have passed
pylorus.
