Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 943**]
Chief Complaint:
GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
52 y/o M with cryptogenic cirrhosis, varices, who presents from
outside hospital with GI bleed. He presented to OSH one day
prior to admission after having melena and hematemesis at home.
Reports throwing up both bright red blood and clots. In
addition, he reported increasing abdominal girth over last
several months. Denied chest pain, palpitaions.
+Lightheadedness.
.
At the OSH, found to have hct of 35.1, INR 1.8. Given Vitamin K,
FFP, PPI and Octreotide 50mcg bolus, followed by octreotide
drip. EGD was performed [**10-17**] which revealed no active bleeding
or red whale marks. Grade II-III esophogeal varices were seen,
in addition to esophogeal erosions. There was no gastric varices
and no blood seen in stomach. He was continued on IV PPI and IV
octreotide. However, the following morning [**10-18**], he vomited
moderate amount of emesis with approximately 50% clotted blood.
At that time, hgb checked, found to be 11. Repeat EGD was
performed on [**2184-10-18**], with banding of 3 varices. Transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
On arrival here, complains of mild abdominal pains secondary to
distension. Denies chest pains, SOB. Passed one melanotic BM. No
further hematemesis


Past Medical History:
# cryptogenic cirrhosis- initial onset of cholestatic hepatitis
after having a cholecystectomy; has undergone numerous
investigations, including cross-sectional imaging, liver biopsy
and ERCP on two occasions. A complete serological evaluation has
not shown any cause for his liver cirrhosis.  He has had two
normal ERCPs performed at an outside institution. His liver
biopsies here have shown features consistent with large bile
duct obstruction
# h/o arterial portal venous fistulae: noted within his right
lobe of his liver s/p embolization
# jaundice at the age of 4
# DM II- insulin requiring w/ peripheral neuropathy, retinopathy
# GERD
# CAD- 3 MI's in past, w/ 2 angioplasties, no stents

Social History:
He stopped drinking alcohol two years ago. Prior to that, he
reports occasional ETOH use. 30+ pack year smoking history.
Still actively smoking 1ppd

Family History:
No family history of liver disease. He has no history of blood
transfusion or intravenous drugs.  He did snort cocaine
periodically during his 20's.  He has never been a blood donor,
does not have any
tattoos and never served in the military

ADMIT LABS:
==========
[**2184-10-18**] 10:18PM   WBC-4.8 RBC-3.02* HGB-10.1* HCT-30.1*

.
LIVER U/S [**2184-10-19**]:
================
Again noted is a small liver with nodular contour and
echotexture consistent with cirrhosis. There is a slightly
increased amount of ascites perihepatically and throughout the
abdomen. The left main and right hepatic veins are patent
demonstrating normal flow and waveforms. The left and right
hepatic arteries are patent demonstrating normal waveforms and
flow. There is reversal flow of the main, left, and right portal
vein, which appears new compared to prior study consistent with
worsening portal hypertension. The spleen is enlarged at the
upper limits of normal. There is no evidence of fistula
formation.

IMPRESSION:
1. Reversal of flow of the portal venous system, which appears
new compared to prior study from [**2184-9-9**] and [**2184-8-8**]. No evidence of thrombosis or fistula formation.
2. Ascites

.
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed. Inferior
akinesis with apical and distal septal hypokinesis are present.

3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
.
ERCP [**2184-9-14**]:
12 ERCP images were obtained by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6745**].  Cholangiogram
shows
normal intra- and extra-hepatic ducts without evidence of
dilatation or stricture.  No intraluminal filling defects are
identified.  Cholecystectomy clips and vascular coils are noted
.
Liver Bx Path [**2184-8-24**]:
.
Right liver lobe, needle core biopsy (A):
1.  Marked bile duct proliferation with associated neutrophils
and cholestasis, see note.
2.  Mild lobular predominately mononuclear all inflammation with
scattered neutrophils.
3.  Trichrome stains shows increased portal and bridging
fibrosis and incomplete nodule formation (Stage 3).
4.  Iron stain shows minimal iron deposits in hepatocytes.
.
II.  Left liver lobe, needle core biopsy (B):
.
1.  Marked bile duct proliferation with associated neutrophils
and cholestasis, see note.
2.  Mild lobular predominately mononuclear all inflammation with
scattered neutrophils.
3.  Trichrome stain shows cirrhosis.
4.  Iron stain shows minimal iron deposits in hepatocytes.
.
Note:  The features are most suggestive of a chronic obstructive
process (biliary type cirrhosis).
.
Abd U/S [**10-18**]- bilateral hydronephrosis. Decreased renal function
with poor response to lasix.


Brief Hospital Course:
52 y/o M w/ cryptogenic cirrhosis, GI bleed [**3-11**] varices s/p
banding at OSH
.
# GI bleed: s/p variceal banding at OSH. Continued initially on
IV pantoprazole, octreotide drip. Remained hemodynamically
stable with stable hematocrit overnight. Hematocrit subsequently
drifted down to 23. Still with some melena, however no further
hemoptysis or bright red blood per rectum. Recieved 2units
packed red blood cells and hematocrit subsequently stabilized
.
# Cirrhosis: Unclear etiology. Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**].
Complicated by esophogeal varices, mild portal gastropathy. No
evidence of encephalopathy. Evidence of ascites on exam. Liver
u/s with dopplers demonstrated no evidence of thrombosis or
fistula. There was noted reversal of flow and ascites.
Diagnostic paracentesis was performed, and was negative for SBP.
Plan for transplant eval per hepatology. Was discharged on
spironolactone 50 mg PO qd, ursodiol 300 mg PO bid.
.
# DMII: continued on lantus. SSI. diabetic diet. neurontin for
neuropathic pain
.
# CAD: chest pain free. EKG with no acute ST changes. no aspirin
given GI bleed. no statin given cirrhosis. On cholestyramine for
lipids. Added simvastatin 10 mg PO qd.
.
# CHF: recent ECHO [**2184-10-8**] shows depressed EF of 40%. Monitored
I's/O's. Given lasix with blood transfusion.
.
# Psych: Continued on sertraline
