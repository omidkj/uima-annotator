.
He was in good health until the past 2 months, when he developed
LE weakness and arthralgias. He was started on steroids for
possible PMR with good effect over the following day. However,
for the past few days the pain has resumed in his wrist
(associated with slight hand swelling) and shoulders, among
other joints. His sx are asymmetric. He is not clear as to
whether there are myalgias, as well. Ear pain is notable on
eating and drinking, which he thinks has reduced his fluid
intake over the last days. He was seen by rheumatology last
week, and his diagnosis remained unclear despite extensive labs,
which were notable for monoclonal gammopathy with positive urine
M-spike. Of note, he also has Bence-[**Doctor Last Name **] proteinurea and
anemia.

His main concern currently is right ear pain, not associated
with scalp tenderness, HA, vision changes, but is worse with jaw
movement. He also had two episodes yesterday where he fell to
his knees, with no injury, and unclear if he lost consciousness.
Although he is very fatigued, he denies specific muscular
weakness.
.
On ROS, he also notes decreased urination over the past day,
noting that he is drinking less because it worsens his ear pain.
He denies fever, chills, night sweats, dysuria, hematuria,
frequency, urgency, diarrhea, incontinence, SOB, wheeze, CP,
abd/flank pain, nausea/vomiting, sore throat. He does confirm
nonproductive cough x3 weeks.
