History of Present Illness:
History is obtained from the medical record and from the patient
with her son serving as interpreter. Please see also OMR notes
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from [**2133-8-13**] and Dr. [**Name (NI) **] from [**2133-6-12**] for
additional information. Briefly, Ms. [**Known lastname 21557**] is a 80 year old
Persian woman who has multiple medical problems including
diet-controlled type II diabetes, hypertension, chronic joint
pain (osteoarthritis and seronegative RA vs. PMR), and recent
visual problems with ocular discomfort. She has had recent
complaints of chest pain and progressive dyspnea on exertion (to
the point where she has had to crawl up stairs and sit down
while shopping) for which she has been evaluated by Dr.
[**Name (NI) **].
.
In terms of her chest pain and DOE, she describes both as
occurring together. The chest pain is present constantly,
ranging from severity of [**4-9**] to [**11-9**] and is worse with
movement, pressure to the chest wall, deep breathing, or
exertion. The shortness of breath is only with activity and does
not occur at rest. She describes the chest pain as pressure-like
in quality and occuring in the center chest to beneath the left
breast. She has had these symptoms for several months but feels
that they have been getting worse recently. She has had a cough
for about the last two months which is occasionally productive
of white sputum; she initially thought that this was due to a
cold and had some associated runny nose, though now feels cough
is not due to URI as it has persisted.
.
She underwent echocardiogram in [**5-/2133**] which showed mild LVH
with preserved ejection fraction (> 55%) and was otherwise
unrevealing in terms of etiology for her dyspnea. In addition,
she has had periodic complaints of heart palpitations for which
she was been monitored by [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts; 7 symptomatic episodes
revealed sinus rhythm at rate 60s-80s with occasional APBs and
atrial bigeminy.  She did undergo stress test back in [**2124**] by
Persantine MIBI which was negative for ischemia, but has had no
further stress testing since that time. Currently, she is
awaiting ophthalmologic procedure for her eye discomfort, and
her ophthalmologist at Mass Eye & Ear has recommended complete
cardiac work up prior to this procedure (details unclear as
notes are out of our system; however, per Dr.[**Name (NI) 21558**] clinic
note from [**2133-8-13**] it is "non urgent"). In addition, per Dr. [**Name (NI) 21559**] note from [**2133-6-12**], cardiac catheterization is
indicated to evaluate for left main disease prior to surgery
requiring monitored anesthesia care, as well as to further
evaluate for coronary artery disease given her multiple risk
factors for atherosclerosis.  She had cardiac catheterization
planned recently, although this procedure was cancelled given
her aspirin allergy and the possible need for intervention. The
patient was given the option of waiting for allergy appointment
to further evaluate this allergy or for CCU admission for rapid
desensitization, and chose the latter.
.
On review of systems, she denies any recent fever, chills,
nightsweats or rigors. She denies prior history of stroke, TIA,
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time
of surgery. No PND or clear orthopnea (must sleep on her side
secondary to back/spine pain). She does have swelling of the
ankles which has been stable, as well as swelling in the knees
from her arthritis (L > R). She has had palpitations for which
sh has worn KOH monitor as above. She has multiple myalgias and
joint pains for which she is followed in rheumatology clinic;
these are stable. Cough as per HPI with no hemoptysis. No
N/V/D/C, no abdominal pain, no changes in bowel habits (last BM
this morning, normal), no black stools or red stools. She has
had several episodes of LH over the past several days, most
recently two days ago when she felt lightheaded after getting
out of a car and had to sit and hold her head. No syncope. No
dysuria or hematuria. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

CXR ([**2133-8-16**]):
In comparison with the study of [**6-24**], there are lower lung
volumes that accentuate the prominence of the transverse
diameter of the heart. There is fullness of indistinct pulmonary
vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure,
beyond that which would be expected with poor inspiration on a
portable examination.

Cardiac Cath ([**2133-8-17**]):
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
no angiographically-apparent flow-limiting stenoses.  The LMCA
was free
from angiographic disease.  The LAD had mild plaquing. The
ostial
diagonal branch demonstrated 60% focal stenosis.  The LCx was a
