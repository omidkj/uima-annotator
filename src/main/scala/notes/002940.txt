Chief Complaint:
Hypotension in Clinic

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Dialysis

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 21658**] is an 85 year old man, recently discharged from the
intensive care unit, with history of prior DVT (now s/p IVC
filter), HTN, CKD on HD, right lower extremity dry gangrene,
presenting from his PCP/cardiologist's office where the pt had a
chief complaint of worsening SOB and cough. Per ED notes
(patient is poor historian) the pt has "not looked great" for
the past few days. The pt is currently living at [**Hospital1 **],
denies nausea, vomiting. Has been regularly attending dialysis.


Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 21658**] has been residing at nursing home since his
discharge, and has been feeling more weak and short of breath
than usual in the last few days. Hemodyalisis has been limited
secondary to hypotension.

In the emergency department the pt's vital signs were: 98.5,
P90, NP 70/48, RR22 and O2sat 96% on 3L. In the ED the pt
received 2 or 3 liters IVF (although only 1L documented in ED
papers), and had a chest x-ray that showed a new left-sided PNA
and he got Vanc and Zosyn with improvement in SBP's to in low
100's.

Imaging:
CXR [**2181-2-28**]: Indistinctness of the left heart border which may
be related to overlying soft tissue, but infection is not
excluded.

CXR [**2181-3-4**]: Portable chest radiograph demonstrates a large-bore
catheter on the right extending into the cavoatrial junction.
The left IJ catheter has been removed. The left costophrenic
angle has been omitted from the study. There is a probable small
left pleural effusion. There is patchy atelectasis at the left
lung base. There is also mild patchy airspace opacity in both
lungs which could represent a combination of atelectasis or
aspiration, possibly infiltrate. There is mild congestive
failure. Heart is top normal in size.

LUE U/S [**2181-3-6**]: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the left
arm.

CXR [**2181-3-9**]: Since [**2181-3-6**], lung volumes are lower,
increasing bibasilar dependant atelectasis. Note that the right
costophrenic angle was excluded. Small left pleural effusion is
likely unchanged. Mild volume overload persists. A right PICC, a
right central venous line, and a gastrostomy tube are still in
place. There is no other change.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypotension: The cause of the patient's hypotension was
unclear, since although he had a leukocytosis on admission,
there was no convincing infiltrate on chest x-ray, and the pt's
HD line appeared non-erythematous. The pt does have extensive
right lower extremity gangrene with ulceration of the right
ankle, which may be a potential nidus of infection. Microbiology
failed to grow out organisms other than Coagulase Negative
Staph, which may have been a contaminant. Given the pt's tenuous
status on admission the pt was treated initially with broad
spectrum antibiotics (Vanc and Zosyn) which were then tapered to
just Vanc to treat a presumed line infection for a 14-day
course. During the first few days of this admission the pt's
blood pressure was supported with peripheral vasopressin, which
was stopped successfully on [**3-3**] and [**3-5**], but on both days was
added back on during dialysis sessions during which the pt's
blood pressure would fall to the 70s systolic. On transfer to
the CCU the pt was no longer requiring vasopressin, although did
have SBP 60s with HD once, treated with 500cc IV fluid. Other
sessions of HD were associated with asymptomatic hypotension to
SBPs 80s, which improved without intervention with SBPs
typically in 90s. He remained afebrile, although cultures were
sent [**3-9**] for an elevated temp of 100.0. Urine cultures were
positive for VRE and patient was started on linezolid as
described below.

2. Tachycardia: During the pt's HD session on [**3-5**] the pt
developed a rapid heart rate in the 160s. Carotid massage was
attempted several times with no alteration in the rhythm. Then
adenosine 6mg was administered with no effect. Then adenosine
12mg was administered with a temporary drop in heart rate to the
40s, but then a return to the 160s. Then amiodarone was loaded
and the pt's heart rate improved to the 100s, and blood pressure
was initially low, but then systolics returned to the 100s.
During the episode of tachycardia, there were morphologies
suggesting AVNRT and afib. After initial amio dosing, heart rate
was subsequently normal and rhythm was sinus and he required no
more antiarrhythmics. Amiodarone was stopped.

3. PVD: Vascular saw the pt on admission in the ED and felt that
the gangrene was not the cause of the pt's symptoms. The patient
will be seen as an outpatient by Vascular surgery to determine a
date for outpatient right AKA.
.
4. Elevation in troponin: On admission the pt's Troponin T was
at recent baseline (0.26-0.37). Chronically elevated troponins
likely secondary to chronic renal failure. No chest pain, no
change on EKG.

5. End stage renal disease: During this admission nephrology saw
the pt and continued dialysis. Dialysis was limited at time by
hypotension and chest pain. Last HD was on [**2181-3-12**] and was
finished with no complications.

6. CAD: At rehab the pt was on ASA, statin and verapamil. ASA
and statin were continued, but verapamil was held in the setting
of hypotension.

7. Pain control: Patient vague regarding chronic pain, but may
be due to gangrenous right foot. Controlled with fentanyl patch
25mcg and oxycod
