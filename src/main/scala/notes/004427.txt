Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status

PICC placement
Femoral Line Placement


History of Present Illness:
66 yo F with multiple medical problems including CAD, CHF,
cirrhosis (and prior encephalopathy), hx DVT's, aspiration,
chronic lower extremity ulcers w/cellulitis on abx presented
from home with altered mental status. Per husband, her MS had
been worsening gradually over the past 3 days. She was having
cough with some sputum production. She was responsive on the
morning of admission but very lethargic and also had
incontinence. A FSG showed recording of 34 but was corrected to
~150 with administration of juice. However her MS did not
improve with improvement in her FSG.
.
ED: Her BP was around 80's/40's, after 1L -> SBP was >100
(baseline SBP in 90-100). She was DNR/DNI but family was okay
with lines in the ED. A L Fem line was placed as no other access
could be obtained. CXR - ?LLL PNA, left sided effusion. Vascular
[**Doctor First Name **] consulted who did not think that the leg was likley source
of sepsis. Head CT showed sinusitis. She got vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**].
.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**]: upon arrival to ICU, I had extensive discussion with the
husband who is her HCP. [**Name (NI) **] note, patient's functional status
had been gradually declining over the last 7 months. The patient
and family were frustrated with the fact that the patient had
been at home for only 2 weeks of the last 7 months and she had a
poor quality of life. The husband did not want any aggressive
measures which included no NG tube, no pressors and the goal was
to make her comfortable and to try only IV medications if
required.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2180-11-27**] 2:12 PM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: Please evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage in this
patient

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
66 year old woman with multiple medical problems presenting with
altered mental status.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage in this patient on
coumadin or any other explanation for her altered mental status.

CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: 66-year-old female with multiple medical problems
presenting with altered mental status.

COMPARISON: CT head of [**2180-8-8**].

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images through the brain were
acquired without IV contrast administration.

FINDINGS: No evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass
effect, or large vascular territory infarction is present.
Ventricular configuration is not changed. Vascular
calcifications are noted in the intracranial vertebral arteries
and the internal carotid arteries. The patient is status post
left cataract surgery. Compared to [**2180-8-8**], there is new
opacification of some ethmoid air cells and mucosal thickening
in the left maxillary sinus. The remainder of the visualized
paranasal sinuses and the mastoid air cells are well aerated. No
fracture is present.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.

2. Left maxillary and ethmoid sinus disease.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2180-11-27**] 10:53 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: cardiopulmonary process

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
66 year old woman with rhonchi
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
cardiopulmonary process
HISTORY: 66-year-old female with rhonchi.

COMPARISON: A series of chest radiographs from [**2180-10-19**] through
[**2180-11-4**].

PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Since [**2180-11-4**], there has been
interval removal of a right PICC and Dobbhoff tube. There is
likely some increase in the moderate-to-large left pleural
effusion compared to the study performed nearly a month prior.
The left retrocardiac opacity persists, likely representing
pleural effusion, associated atelectasis, although underlying
pneumonia cannot be excluded. The cardiac silhouette is obscured
on the left by the pleural effusion and atelectasis; however,
there is likely stable cardiomegaly. Prominence of the pulmonary
vessels is consistent with pulmonary venous congestion and
indistinctness of the pulmonary vessels likely represents
interstitial edema. No focal airspace opacities are seen in the
right lung or left upper lung. The bony thorax appears intact.

IMPRESSION:

Vascular congestion with interstitial edema, overall unchanged
from [**2180-11-4**]. There may be some increase in the left pleural
effusion which is now likely moderate to large in size, with
associated atelectasis.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2180-11-29**] 11:29 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: interval change, worsening effusion, chf and/or pna

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
66 year old woman with pna, inc SOB this am s/p volume
resuscitation last night
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
interval change, worsening effusion, chf and/or pna
HISTORY: Shortness of breath.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-27**], the degree of
vascular congestion has substantially decreased, though there is
still evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure and a large
left effusion. Right subclavian catheter extends to the lower
portion of the SVC.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 F with NASH cirrhosis, seizure dz on keppra, DVT on coumadin,
chronic LE ulceration now with altered mental status in setting
of multiple medical problems including new pneumonia and sepsis.


# Sepsis [**1-21**] wound infections vs. PNA: Transiently hypotensive
responded to 1L NS in ED; elevated white count with bandemia.
Hypotensive on night of admissionwith worsening UOP to <10cc/hr
which trailed off to anuria. Treated with antibiotics and gentle
fluid hydration without improvement in sepsis.  Family did not
want any life sustaining measures including the use of pressor
agents.
.
# Acute oliguric on chronic renal failure: baseline 1.8 until
[**10-19**], then increased to 2.3-2.5. Increased further to 2.7 a
