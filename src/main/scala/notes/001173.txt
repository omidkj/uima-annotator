altered mental status, hypoxia

Transesophageal echocardiogram [**2125-9-18**]


History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 81 yo M with
rheumatic heart disease (c/b aortic stenosis s/p recent [**Known lastname 1291**]/MVR
on [**2125-7-3**]) and atrial fibrillation who presents from his
rehabilitation center with altered mental status.
.
The patient was recently admitted to the cardiothoracic service
from [**2125-7-2**] - [**2125-7-26**] for worsening shortness of breath thought
to be due to worsening AS, MR, and worsening heart failure (EF
40%). He was taken to the OR on [**7-3**] for aortic valve replacement
with a St. Jude's valve, aortic endarterectomy, and MVR with a
[**Company 1543**] mosaic tissue valve. His hospital course was
complicated by hypotension requiring pressor support and
eventual failure to extubate due to altered mental
status/encephalopathy and inability to handle secretions. He
received trach and PEG on [**2125-7-17**]. He also received 7 days of
Vancomycin and Cefepime for the secretions (presumably for
emperic treatment of VAP). Of note, he did have some delerium
noted at night -- seroquel was attempted but discontinued due to
somnolence.
He was tolerated trach collar, PM valve, and tube feeds prior to
discharge to [**Hospital6 1293**].
.
His daughter reports that at baseline, he has baseline dementia
but has some baseline cognitive function, including being alert,
interactive, and talkative.  Of note, trach was also removed at
rehab. However, his mental status at rehab has been waxing and
[**Doctor Last Name 688**] during his rehab stay (documented in multiple
cardiothoracic NP[**MD Number(3) 29639**] as having confusion at rehab
occasionally requiring restraints and wandering), but noted by
his dtr to be worsening over the past week since he was
transferred to a new [**Hospital1 1501**]. He has had episodes of jerking
movements of his fingers or a 'kick' of the legs.
Independently, he also has episodes of lethargy, where he falls
"asleep" mid-sentence, is unresponsive to tactile or verbal
stimuli, then returns to his baseline but appears
drowsy/confused. These unresponsive episodes were occurring [**2-28**]
times a day, but were also increasing in frequency during the
week prior to admission. Haldol and Trazodone have been
attempted at rehab without good effect and were discontinued due
the drowsiness as well as (per ED report) some symptoms of lip
smacking that were thought to be [**2-27**] tardive dyskinesia. He was
originally discharged on tube feeds, but per report has been
tolerating a PO diet. He was brought into the ED today for
further evaluation of these symptoms.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.5 90 130/102 18 99% on room air
Patient was given ativan 2 mg IV x1, Vancomyin 1 gram IV x1,
CFTX 2 grams IV x1, and Dexamethasone 10 mg IV x1. Labs
significant for a WBC of 14.0, ALT of 41, AST of 47, INR of 3.8,
and chemistries WNL. No formal ABG performed, but pH noted to be
7.40 at 4:46 PM. He was noted multiple times by the ED
attendings and residents to have multiple (>3) lethargic
episodes and multiple episodes of myoclonic jerks. The patient
would be responsive afterwards, but somewhat confused per
report, stating he was 'in Brookline'. He got 2 mg of Ativan for
presumed seizure activity and became unresponsive with slight
desaturation requiring BiPAP. Neurology was consulted in the ED
and thought the patient was having myoclonic
jerks/encephalopathy, but exam was clouded by recently receiving
Ativan. Head CT with no acute intracranial process. CTA
demonstrated no PE, LLL aspiration pneumonitis, and a stable
AAA. He was initially going to be taken onto the neurology
service, but due to concern for his unresponsiveness and
possible respiratory compromise, he was admitted to the MICU for
further monitoring.  His VS were afebrile 110 25 125/86 100% on
NRB prior to transfer.
.
On the floor,  the patient is lethargic and minimally responsive
to vocal or tactile stimuli. IV metoprolol 5 mg q5 min given
upon admission to the floor for AF w/ RVR.
