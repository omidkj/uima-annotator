History of Present Illness:
This is an 85 yo m w/ a hx gastric/small bowel AVMs, recently
admitted for shock attributed to a GIB, afib, CHF (EF 20%), CRI
(stage 4), who was transferred from rehab for altered mental
status and worsening renal function. He was noted initially at
rehab to have worsening creatinine, and was scheduled to be seen
in renal clinic as an outpatient. Then today, he developed AMS,
and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, the patient was altered, with initial vitals found
him to be hypothermic, hypotensive to 60-70's, brady to 30-40's.
He received a femoral line, calcium, 1500cc NS (not more out of
concern for possible cardiogenic shock). A bedside shock u/s did
not demonstrate a pericardial effusion but showed global
hypokinesis, and a large right sided pleural effusion. A CT
torso demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions R>>L with
associated atelectasis and cardiomegaly, but no intraabdominal
pathology on wet read. A UA was dirty. Lactate was wnl, CE's
were within his baseline in the setting of renal failure. EKG
was notable for low voltage afib with bradycardia but no
ischemic changes compared to prior. BNP was 3200 (which is in
the middle of recent values). He received a dose vanco/zosyn. He
was guaiac pos brown stool initially. An ABG was notable for a
respiratory acidosis and he was intubated with etom and
rocuronium for airway protection and increased minute
ventilation. Of note, he was a difficult intubation and there
was a ?edema in airway. He was also started on levophed after he
did not respond to 1.5L NS. Because he was hypothermic, a rectal
probe was attempted to be placed, and he then was found to have
a "puddle" of BRBPR, but then nothing actively coming out. NG
lavage negative. GI was consulted and evaluated him in the ED,
but felt that given his stable hct (28 -> 29) that this was
unlikely to explain his shock. He was type and screened, and
received 2 units in ED. Urine output was poor throughout ED
stay.
.
He is transferred to the MICU for further management of
hypotension, acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory failure
and hypothermia. Upon transfer, HR 66, BP 113/64 on levophed
0.12mcg, satting 100% on A/C 500x14 peep 5 and FiO2 1.0.
.
Of note, pt was recently admitted from end of [**Month (only) 116**] to [**5-23**]
for hypotension, respiratory failure and GIB. Hct did drop at
that time to 21 with reports of melena. EGD was normal w/o AVMs
seen. Recent [**Last Name (un) **] [**3-20**] normal as well except for some small
polyps. During recent hospital course, pt intubated for presumed
CHF, had worsening renal failure, and also found to have new
parietal CVA. Coumadin held given bleeding and pt d/c'd to rehab
on [**5-23**].

Echo ([**6-5**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45 %).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-4-2**],
the left ventricular systolic function is better. The severity
of tricuspid regurgitation and detected pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension have increased. . The echocardiographic
findings are consistent with restrictive cardiomyopathy (?
Amyloid, Fabry's).

Lower Extrem U/S - IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein
thrombosis in either leg.

Brief Hospital Course:
#  Respiratory Failure ?????? The patient initially presented with a
respiratory acidosis and was intubated in the ED.  Lower
extremity ultrasounds ruled out DVT.  He was initially weaned to
pressure support with a plan to extubate; however, increased
frothy secretions resulted in switching him back to assist
control.  Further attempts to wean to pressure support have
failed with the patient becoming tachypnic. Additionally, after
his empiric 7-day course of vancomycin and zosyn, the patient
developed a leukocytosis and was started on zosyn, which was
switched to meropenem when sputum cultures grew out klebsiella.
Percutaneous tracheostomy placed on [**6-25**].  Pt then transitioned
to trach mask without difficulty and has tolerated it well.

#. Hypotension ?????? On admission, the etiology was not entirely
clear.  Despite the pa
