.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], vitals were T98.6 HR86 BP106/78 O289. Pt
denied chest pain, palpitations, trauma, F/C, N/V/D. R shoulder
full PROM, limited abduction on active ROM. Labs were
significant for leukocytosis to 11.8 without bandemia, anemia to
30, elevated bicarbonate 41, Trop 0.05 with flat CKs. EKG was
unremarkable. Pt desatted to low 80s from baseline 88-89 and was
labored.



CXR showed subtle LUL opacity and pt  received CTX and
azithromycin. Blood cultures were sent and ABG 7.25 pCO2 102 pO2
98. BiPAP was attempted but pt did not tolerate. He was given
some ativan and became more lethargic with relatively unchanged
ABG. IP was contact[**Name (NI) **] in the [**Name (NI) **] and confirmed that stent is size
16, can fit 7.5 ETT if necessary. Pt was then intubated in the
ED. CXR confirmed placement.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 17926**] is a 68 yo M with hx of COPD on 3L O2, CAD s/p
cardiac arrest, lung CA s/p RUL resection/chemo/radiation,
trachemalacia s/p tracheal stent replacement last week,
presented from OSH for several days SOB.  Found to be in
hypercapneic respiratory failure thought secondary to COPD
exacerbation.
.
# Respiratory Distress: CXR concerning for left upper pneumonia,
and lung exam also with evidence of COPD exacerbation.  He was
intubated and started on Vancomycin in addition to CTX and
Azithro given by the ED.  He received standing inhalers and high
dose steroids for treatment of acute COPD exacerbation. On [**10-22**]
he was extubated, tolerated extubation without difficulty.  He
was monitored for 24 hrs without further intervention and
transferred to the floor for further care.  His abx were
narrowed to ciprofloxacin given his sputum grew cipro-sensitive
pseudomonas.  He continued to improve on the floor with O2 sats
in the 90s on 3 L at rest, dropping to high 89 with ambulation
on 3L which is his home O2 requirement.  He was discharged on a
prednisone taper and course of cipro (5 days left on discharge).
 He was also treated with bactrim prophylaxis and vit D/Calcium
given his chronic steroid use.
.
# Hypertension: BP meds were initially held given
peri-intubation MAPs 60s, however restarted as pressures and HR
stabilized on transfer to the floor.  He was discharged on his
home doses of metoprolol tartrate, quinapril and HCTZ.
.
# Squamous cell cancer of lung: pt will f/u with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2036**].
There was some concern for metastatic disease causing his RUE
weakness.  MRI was obtained of the shoulder and showed no
evidence of rotator cuff tear, some fluid in the joint and
tenosynovitis, however no clear cause of his weakness.  He will
f/u with MRI of the brachial plexus for further evaluation of
his weakness, will also f/u with PCP.
.
#. Shoulder weakness: Patient has had increasing right-sided
shoulder weakness over the last couple of [**Last Name (un) 26512**] which has been
increasingly limiting his ability to care for himself.  The
isolated weakness on adduction suggests a deltoid process with
preserved rotator cuff.  Preliminary MRI read showed no rotator
cuff injury, but tenosynovitis and fluid accumulation in the
joint.  As stated above, there was concern for axilla nerve
injury.  PCP was notified of this issue and further imaging of
the brachial plexus and follow-up will be managed by his PCP on
an outpatient basis.
.
# Metabolic alkalosis: thought to be consempatory in the context
of a respiratory acidosis from COPD.  Sats were maintained in
the low 90s to prevent suppression of his respiratory drive.
Bicarb improved somewhat from admission with treatment of his
COPD.
.
# Coronary Artery Disease s/p cardiac arrest and stent.  His
aspirin and statin were continued in the hospital
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued on simvastatin
.
# Hypothyroidism: Continued on levothyroxine
.
# Chronic lower back: Continued on Naproxen and Fentanyl patch.
There was some concern that his fentanyl patch may be causing
his shoulder pain, therefore it was recommended that he change
the location of the patch when it is replaced.
.
# Gout: Stable. Continued on Allopurinol
.
# Anemia: At baseline Hct 30, concerning for iron deficiency.
No evidence of bleed during this hospitalization.  Recommend
outpatient colonoscopy.
