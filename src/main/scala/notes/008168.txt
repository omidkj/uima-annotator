LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US [**2132-9-19**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Distended gallbladder containing gallstones with gallbladder
wall edema.
2. Borderline/dilated common duct at the porta hepatis, for a
patient of this age. Sludge and possibly small stones are seen
within the common duct. The caliber of the common duct appears
minimally increased from [**2126-1-8**], when the duct measured 7
mm, though sludge within the duct is new from this time.
3. Pneumobilia in the left lobe of the liver, possibly related
to prior
ERCP.
4. Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation within the right lobe.

In the appropriate clinical setting, the findings would raise
concern for cholecystitis/cholangitis. However, it is noted that
patient does not have an elevated white blood cell count or
profound LFT abnormalities. Edema of the gallbladder wall could
be related to third spacing of fluid, particularly given the
pleural effusion. The findings merit further evaluation, both
clinically and/or with ERCP/MRCP.
