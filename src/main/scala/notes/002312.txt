History of Present Illness:
81yo woman with PMH significant for myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], COPD, PE,
and extensive smoking history, p/w weakness and dyspnea. She had
been in her USOH until approximately [**Month (only) 547**], and since then has
been getting progressively weaker. She was diagnosed with
bilateral PEs in [**Month (only) **] and also noted to have paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, for which she was started on coumadin. She feels
she has been relatively stable in terms of her myasthenia. She
says that [**Last Name **] problem is more weakness than difficulty
breathing. She has no diplopia, dysphagia, fevers, chills. She
reports PND and lower extremity edema.

Past Medical History:
1. Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) **] diagnosed in [**11-1**], status post plasma
exchange, CellCept, Mestinon and prednisone. She last had plasma
exchange in 04/[**2113**]. + AChR Ab, EMG consistent with MG.
2. Thymus resection [**2111-12-1**] with pathology consistent with
follicular B-cell hyperplasia.
3. Severe sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Work-up with unremarkable
LP [**2111**] (0W, 0R, 24 prot, 82 gluc, lyme neg, VDRL NR, negative

Neurologic examination:
Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal

right-left confusion. No evidence of neglect. Registration [**3-31**],
recall [**1-31**] with cue.

Cranial Nerves:
Pupils equally round and reactive. Extraocular movements intact
bilaterally, no nystagmus. No diplopia on sustained upgaze. +R
ptosis. Sensation intact V1-V3. Facial movement symmetric.
Hearing grossly intact. Palate elevation symmetrical.
Sternocleidomastoid and trapezius normal bilaterally. Tongue
midline, movements intact.

Sensation: intact to light touch, pin prick, temperature (cold),
vibration, and proprioception in all extremities.
Reflexes: absent
Gait: deferred.

Discharge exam:
General examination, MS, CN, sensation essentially unchanged.
Strength has improved, with 4/5 neck flexors and [**6-2**] neck
extensors. Otherwise, left side slightly improved with 4/5 R
delts, and [**6-2**] biceps.
NIF and FVC have been determined to be inaccurate secondary to
significant air leak, but she is able to count to 28 in one
breath, which is her baseline.

Brief Hospital Course:
81yo woman with past medical history significant for myasthenia
[**Last Name (un) 2902**], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary
embolus, and obstructive sleep apnea presenting with subacute
onset of dyspnea. Her exam was remarkable for decreased air flow
but FVC at baseline. Labs showed a Hct of 26, and CXR was
unremarkable.

Hospital course is detailed below by problem:

1. dyspnea - This was most likely multifactorial and secondary
to anemia, COPD, apnea, PEs, and myasthenia. She was initially
admitted to the ICU for overnight observation; she remained
stable there and was transferred to the step-down unit. Once
there, she was transfused two units PRBCs and immediately felt
better. Her myasethenia medications were continued and not
changed per neuromuscular recommendations; in fact, her
myasthenia remained at baseline and was likely not the reason
for her dyspnea. She was monitored with NIFs and FVCs initially,
but it was later determined that these were likely inaccurate
secondary to significant air leak around the tube. Clinically,
she remained stable and was able to count to 28 in one breath
during the entire admission, with increased ability to walk as
well. She was started on CPAP overnight, which she tolerated for
approximately 6 hours. She did not like it only because it was
not humidified (unable to obtain a humidified CPAP within the
hospital) and therefore made her throat sore and dry. Her COPD
regimen was changed to standing atrovent q6h and prn albuterol.
Her case was discussed with the pulmonary team, who recommended
outpatient follow up, which was scheduled. She was no longer
feeling dyspneic and fatigued (at baseline).

2. anemia - This was consistent with iron deficiency anemia,
with a Fe of 14, a low ferritin, and a high-normal TIBC. Per
hematology, cellcept is more likely to cause leukopenia than the
rare red cell aplasia. She has been on the cellcept long before
she became anemic. Guaiacs were negative, retic count, B12, and
folate nl. Her iron supplementation was increased to 325mg po
tid, and she was started on B12.

3. atrial fibrillation - She was continued on coumadin, with INR
2.6. Metoprolol was continued for rate control, though she
refused it daily. Her HR remained below 100. She was monitored
on telemetry.

4. myasthenia - Mestinon, cellcept, prednisone continued during
the hospitalization without adjustment per her primary
neurologist.

PPx - treated with vitamin D, calcium, PPI, SSI, bactrim, MVI
