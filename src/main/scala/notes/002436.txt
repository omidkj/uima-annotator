Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness, shoulder/neck pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2111-1-5**]: right heart cath, pericardial tap, arterial puncture


History of Present Illness:
80 yo M with HTN, who presents with weakness and shoulder/neck
pain.  Of note, he was recently observed in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED on
[**12-16**] with similar complaints and had a MIBI that showed
no reversible defect. He reports 4 weeks of gradually worsening
weakness, waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**], without any sensory neurologic
symptoms. On the day prior to presentation, he felt that he was
unable to move at all prompting him to come to ED.  He does also
report neck/throat tightness with radiation to the shoulders for
the last 5 days. It waxes and wanes, lasting 30-60 minutes, it's
pleuritic without an exertional component. Patient does report
SOB, palpitations, a "trembling chest", and five days' of a dry
cough.
.
In ED: patient received ASA 325 on [**12-4**], Lasix 20 mg IV and 1 x
SLNTG. EKG nsr @ 87, nl axis, IVCD, TWI in III, aVF; q in III -
old; no new ST changes, no new Q waves. CE's flat x 2. A V/Q
scan was low likelihood for pulmonary embolism.
.
On the floor, he developed progressively worsening dyspnea and
hypoxia.  He was noted to have a pulsus of 22 and a bedside echo
showed RV collapse; he was taken urgently for pericardial
drainage with removal of 400cc of serosanguinous fluid and drain
placement.
.
ROS: No dysuria/hematuria, no abdominal pain, no back pain, no
n/v/d, no diaphoresis. Does report transient lightheadedness
this AM, with a headache that resolved.  Patient denies any
urinary retention or fecal incontence. He does report
hematochezia x1 approx 2 wks ago after straining for a hard BM;
denies known hx of hemorrhoids.

Pertinent Results:
V/Q scan ([**1-5**]):
Low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism.
.
MRA Chest ([**1-5**]):
No evidence of aortic dissection.  Questionable area of wall
thickening in the ascending aorta at the level of the main
pulmonary artery. Although the finding is potentially
artifactual, further assessment with a dedicated non-contrast
chest CT is recommended to exclude an intramural hematoma.  No
evidence of aneurysm. Moderate pericardial effusion. Small
bilateral pleural effusions with associated bilateral lower lobe
atelectasis.
.
ECG ([**2111-1-5**]): ECG: nsr @ 87, nl axis, IVCD, TWI in III, aVF; q
in III - old; no new ST changes, no new Q waves
.
Bedside TTE ([**2111-1-5**]): There is a moderate sized pericardial
effusion. There is right ventricular  diastolic collapse,
consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.  Left
ventricular systolic function is grossly preserved.
.
Cardiac cath ([**2111-1-5**]):  Resting hemodynamics were performed. The
femoral arterial pressures had a pulsus of 41mmHg at the
beginning of the procedure. The right sided filling pressures
were significantly elevated (mean RA pressures were 25mmHg). The
PCWP pressures were elevated at 25-30mmHg.  The pericardial
pressures were elevated at 20mm Hg.  Successful
pericardiocentesis was performed with appx 300cc of
serosanguinous fluid removed.  Drain left in place.  Post
pericardiocentesis, there was resolution of respiratory
variation of the femoral arterial tracing. The right sided
filling pressures were mildly elevated (mean RA pressures was
12mmHg). The left sided filling pressures have improved (mean
PCW pressures were 21mmHg). The cardiac index improved to 3.2
l/min/m2.  The pericardial pressures were appx 0mmHg.
.
Pericardial fluid cytology ([**2111-1-5**]): negative for malignant
cells
.
CT Chest ([**2111-1-6**]): Tracheomalacia with narrowing of the main
stem bronchi.
Pericardial effusion.  Bilateral pleural effusions.  Increased
pulmonary parenchymal density most likely representing mild
edema. Compressive atelectasis.  Hepatic cyst.
.
TTE ([**2111-1-8**]): The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is small. Left ventricular systolic function
is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
There is a small pericardial effusion subtending the lateral
wall of the left ventricle. There are no echocardiographic signs
of tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
Shortly after admission to the floor for hypoxia, Mr. [**Known lastname **] MRI
from the ED was noted to show a moderate-sized pericardial
effusion.  Although his ECG did not show electrical alternans or
low voltages, a pulsus was checked and found to be elevated at
22 mm Hg.  An urgent cardiology consultation was obtained and a
bedside TTE showed RV collapse and tamponade physiology.  He was
taken directly to cardiac catheterization where 400cc of
serosanguinous fluid was removed and a pericardial drain was
placed; he was sent to the CCU for further care.  All studies
(including Gram stain, culture, and cytology) returned as
negative.  He experienced relief of his dyspnea with the removal
of this fluid but remained hypoxemic requiring 100% NRB
facemask.
.
On hospital day 2, his percardial drain showed no fluid output
and a followup TTE showed no evidence of reaccumulation so his
drain was pulled.  A chest CT showed no evidence of malignancy
or any other pathology that could potentially explain his
tamponade.
.
Due to a fever spike and concern for an infiltrate on his CXR,
he was started on a 7-day course of empiric levofloxacin and
metronidazole for suspected pneumonia.  He was aggressively
diuresed with a gradual decrease in his oxygen requirements over
the course of his hospital stay.  A V/Q scan in the ED was low
probability for PE and LENIs were negative for DVT.  A pulmonary
consultation was obtained and agreed that his pneumonia and
fluid overload were the most likely cause of his hypoxemia.  By
discharge, he was saturating 92-94% on room air.
.
Of note, on admission, he was found to be in acute-on-chronic
renal failure, though to be secondary to renal hypoperfusion
from his tamponade.  His meds were renally-dosed, his [**Last Name (un) **] was
held, and his creatinine gradually improved with diuresis and
improvement of his cardiac functioning.
.
He was also noted to have an acute-on-chronic anemia, though no
source of acute bleeding could be identified.  Iron studies were
consistent with an anemia of chronic inflammation, although his
very low serum iron also suggested some component of iron
deficiency.  He was started on iron repletion and further causes
of anemia should be worked up as an outpatient.
