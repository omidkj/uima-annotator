Date of Birth:   [**2112-1-6**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CARDIOLOGY

DATE OF DISCHARGE:  To be determined pending rehabilitation
placement.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 74-year-old
female with a history of coronary disease and congestive
heart failure, who presented to [**Hospital3 3834**] [**Hospital3 **]
complaining of substernal chest pain.  She required oxygen,
IV Morphine and heparin to control her pain.  She was
transferred here for cardiac catheterization after her pain
continued.  When she arrived at [**Hospital1 **] she was
found to be anticoagulated with INR of 3.3.  She was also
felt to be in mild congestive heart failure and she was
diuresed, but upon initial evaluation she was felt to be
comfortable and without shortness of breath, chest pain,
abdominal pain, lower extremity edema, melena, or bright red
blood per rectum.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History is notable for the following:
1.  Glaucoma.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
4.  Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 20%.
Last echocardiogram was [**2185-9-29**].
5.  Coronary artery disease, status post multiple LAD
interventions.
6.  Aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Plavix, recently discontinued.
2.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o.b.i.d.
3.  Kerlone 20 mg p.o.b.i.d.
4.  Coumadin 2 mg p.o. for five days a week and 4 mg p.o. for
the other two days.
5.  Zestril 40 mg p.o.q.d.
6.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o.q.d.
7.  Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o.q.d.
8.  Protonix 40 mg p.o.q.d'
9.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o.q.d.
10. Xalatan 1 drop to both eyes q.h.s. or 1 drop OU q.h.s.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states that she is ALLERGIC TO
NOVOCAINE AND TO NITROGLYCERIN, WHICH MAKES HER HYPOTENSIVE
WITH BRADYCARDIA.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies any history of smoking.
She is a widow who lives alone.  She denies any alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination the
temperature is 96.0, pulse 52, blood pressure 130/50,
respiratory rate 16, saturations 100% on two liters.
GENERAL:  The patient is awake, alert, and in no acute
distress.  Extraocular muscles are intact.  Oropharynx clear.
Mucous membranes moist.  Lungs:  Demonstrated crackles
bilaterally at the bases.  She does have 9 cm of JVD.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm with 3/6 systolic
ejection murmur that radiates to her carotids and a [**1-4**]
holosystolic murmur at the apex.  ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender,
and nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.  EXTREMITIES:
Extremities are without edema, but have faint pulses.  They
are, otherwise, warm and pink.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission revealed the following:
White count 8.1, hematocrit 35.8, platelet count 287,000.  PT
21.6, PTT 150, INR 3.3, sodium 141, potassium 4.2, chloride
101, bicarbonate 26, BUN 14, creatinine 1.1, and glucose 162.
She reportedly has a baseline creatinine of 0.7 to 0.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiology
Service with a diagnosis of chest pain.  She was originally
sent for cardiac catheterization, but this was delayed due to
her elevated INR.  She had a stress test that demonstrated a
time of 7 minutes, maximum heart rate 51%.   The test was
stopped for fatigue.  During this time, she had an EKG, which
was not interpreted. Ejection fraction was less than 30% and
she global hypokinesis and septal dyskinesis with reversible
apical and inferior defects.  She also had an echocardiogram
that demonstrated an ejection fraction of less than 20% with
an aortic gradient of 50 in addition to 2+ aortic
regurgitation, 2+ mitral valve regurgitation and 1+ to 2+
tricuspid regurgitation.  The patient ultimately had a
cardiac catheterization that showed disease in multiple
vessels.  She was referred to the cardiac surgery team for
intervention.

On [**2186-4-25**], the patient was taken for a three-vessel
coronary artery bypass graft and tissue aortic valve
replacement.  She had a LIMA to LAD, saphenous vein graft to
diagonal, and saphenous vein graft to the right coronary.
She also had a 21-mm tissue pericardial valve replaced.  All
of this was done for her diagnosis of aortic stenosis and
coronary artery disease.  The patient's procedure itself was
remarkable for a cardiac bypass time of 148 minutes and
cross-clamp time of 127 minutes.  The patient was taken
postoperatively to the cardiac surgery ICU on Milrinone,
Levophed, and Propofol drips.  While in the Intensive Care
Unit, she had episodes of bradycardia to the 30s.  During
this time she appeared to be in a junctional rhythm.
Attempts were made to pace the patient through her atrial
wires, but there was no capture.  The patient was, therefore,
paced ventricularly to a rate of 80 and electrophysiology
consultation was obtained.  During her first day in the
Intensive Care Unit, she was weaned from the ventilator and
extubated without incident.  She was also transfused with one
unit of packed red blood cells.

The electrophysiology team felt that given the need for
continued therapy with beta blockers and Amiodarone, in light
of her absence of sinus activity, she would benefit from an
insertion of implantable pacemaker.  On [**2186-4-28**], the
patient was taken to the Electrophysiology Laboratory, where
she had a [**Company 1543**] dual-chamber rate-responsive pacemaker
inserted.  It was left in DDD mode with a lower rate of 60.
Following her procedure, she did have four doses of
Vancomycin for prophylaxis against infection.  In addition,
she had a urinary tract infection, which was discovered prior
to her pacemaker insertion and this was subsequently found to
be E.coli.  She was initiated on a ten-day course of Levaquin
before her pacemaker was inserted.

Within a few days after all of these events, the patient was
stable on the Cardiac Surgery Floor.  She did complain of
some nausea and some pain around her pacemaker site.  The
pain was adequately controlled with Toradol and Tylenol and
occasional Percocet.  In addition, she was started on Reglan
and p.o. Zofran to control her nausea.

By her 7th postoperative day, [**2186-5-2**], the patient was
feeling much improved.  She was medically ready to be
transferred to rehabilitation.  The patient was asked to
followup in pacer clinic in one week for interrogation.  In
addition, she is to followup with her primary care physician
and cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11493**] in two weeks.  In addition,
she is to followup with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in four weeks.

The patient was transferred to rehabilitation on the
following medications:
