Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
N/V, Abdominal Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
85F with hx of COPD, CHF, esophageal ulcer, and significant
restless leg syndrome transferred from OSH for further
management of abdominal pain and fevers concerning for acute
cholecytitis c/b sepsis. Patient was in her USOH until Sunday
evening when she developed abdominal pain, non-bloody vomiting,
and nausea. She describes the pain as sharp and crampy with
severity ranging from [**2121-4-26**] pain with inability to take PO's
since Sunday afternoon. She denies sick contacts at her nursing
home but does state that there's been a stomach bug going
around. She presented to [**Hospital6 19155**] earlier today
where her initial VS were 98.2, 92, 179/92, 24, 92%RA. Labs
notable for WBC of 21.3K, 83 segs, 0 bands, K of 3.3, Cr 0.9,
Dig < 0.04, lactate 2.9, LFT's and lipase wnl's, UA with 3+
bacteria, [**2-22**] wbc's, rare epis. She rec'd K repletion with
40meq, 1L NS, duoneb x 1, zosyn 3.25g x 1, atarax, and underwent
CT abd/pelv (report not in chart) which per report showed
massive retrocardiac hernia, markedly distended GB,
pericholecystic fluid suggesting calculous cholecystitis. RUQ
U/S showed thick GB wall but no stones. She was transferred here
for further management.

ED Course: Initial VS - 100.6, 110, 166/100, 16, 97%2LNC
-Labs: 20.9WBC's, no bands, lactate 2.4, INR 1.0, BUN/Cr 15/1.0,
K 3.8, LFT's wnl's, lipase 21.
-EKG: NSR @ 118, NI, leftward axis, Q-waves in II, AVF, poor
r-wave progression, no old priors on record
-RUQ U/S: No stones, extra- and intra-hepatic biliary ducts with
the common bile duct measuring up to 10 mm.
-CXR: Large hiatal hernia, hyperinflated lungs, fibrotic
pattern, no clear pleural effusions or infiltrates
-Evaluated by surgery in the ED who felt given her presentation
c/w cholecystitis/possible cholangitis but given comorbidities
that she is an overall poor surgical candidate and recommended
admission to medical service with percutaneous drainage by IR.
-Admitted to MICU for further management

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS 99.2, 112, 162/84, 25,
96%2LNC. She confirms the above history and complains of mild
headache. She otherwise denies chest pain, shortness of breath
beyond her baseline, sore throat, cough, sinus tenderness, neck
or back pain, urinary symptoms, or extremity discomfort other
than her restless leg syndrome.

MICRO/PATH:
===========
[**2123-4-6**]  MRSA SCREEN: Negative
[**2123-4-6**]  BLOOD CULTURE x 2: NGTD
[**2123-4-6**]  URINE CULTURE: No growth

IMAGING/STUDIES:
================

[**2123-4-8**] HIDA SCAN:
IMPRESSION: Normal hepatobiliary scan. No evidence of
cholecystitis.

[**2123-4-7**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Mild global atrophy with mild chronic microvascular ischemic
disease.

[**2123-4-7**] CT TORSO WITH CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. Dilation of the gallbladder is nonspecific without
accompanying secondary signs of cholecystitis.
2. No definitive acute infectious process identified.
3. Large left hemidiaphragmatic defect without definitive
evidence of bowel obstruction or strangulation. Equivocal fat
stranding is seen here and the contrast column has not cleared
this point-delayed plain film might be useful
4. Marked demineralization accompanied by severe degenerative
changes of the spine and hips. Multiple age indeterminate
thoracic compression fractures.

[**2123-4-6**] CHEST (PA & LAT):
IMPRESSION: Large retrocardiac left mid-to-lower hemithorax
opacity with
areas of lucency with appearance of bowel and possibly stomach,
likely related to large hernia possibly containing bowel, not
well evaluated on this study, no priors for comparison. Minimal
right base atelectasis.

[**2123-4-6**] RUQ U/S:
IMPRESSION: Distended gallbladder without evidence of stones.
There is mild prominence of the extra- and intra-hepatic biliary
ducts with the common bile duct measuring up to 10 mm. However,
the patient has an equivocal [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign post-medication as
demonstrated by the attending radiologist. Acalculous
cholecystitis can not be excluded in the appropriate clinical
setting.

Brief Hospital Course:
85F with a history of CHF, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis who presents
with nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain since Sunday. Imaging
at OSH significant for likely cholecystitis. Deemed poor
surgical candidate so transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of
percutaneous drainage by IR.

ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:

# CHOLECYSTITIS: On arrival patient was with high-grade
leukocytosis, fever, and significant abdominal pain and nausea.
She was admitted to the MICU for concern for evolving sepsis.
She underwent RUQ U/S here with
