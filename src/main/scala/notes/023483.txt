Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for possible ischemia, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
74 y/o male with h/o CAD, PVD, T2DM, and psoriasis who presented
to [**Hospital3 **] with 5-7 days of non-specific symptoms
including SOB, fever, itchy eyes, vomiting, and nausea. He was
found to have a Troponin I elevation to 1.14 then 0.54, CK 48,
and BNP was 770. U/A was negative. CXR at OSH (report sent) was
normal. There was a concern for possible CHF exacerbation and he
was diuresed with IV Lasix. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further evaluation and treatment for possible ischemia.
According to EKG sent from OSH, the EKG revealed LBBB. Last
prior EKG in our system was from [**2099**] and did not reveal any
LBBB. There was also a question of hypotension and per transport
was 90/60s and responded to a small amount of IVF.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU, he was hemodynamically stable. He
denied any CP. He admitted to only a small amount of SOB and the
above mentioned symptoms. He denied orthopnea, PND, or syncope.

Imaging Studies
1. CXR [**2106-8-21**]
Lordotic positioning. The lungs are probably hyperinflated. The
right hemidiaphragm is elevated. There is possible mild
cardiomegaly. The aorta is calcified and mildly unfolded. There
is no CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion.
.
2. p-MIBI [**2106-8-23**]
1) Severe fixed myocardial perfusion defect involving distal
anterior wall and apex. 2) Moderate, fixed myocaridal perfusion
defect involving anteroseptal and inferoseptal walls. 3)
Moderately enlarged left ventricular cavity. 4) Apical akinesis
and diffuse hypokinesis. Calculated LVEF 30%. No anginal
symptoms with an uninterpretable ECG for
ischemia. Nuclear report sent separately.
.
4. Echo [**2106-8-23**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall
left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed. Tissue
velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include septal
hypokinesis/akinesis, apical hypokinesis/akinesis and anterior
hypokinesis. No definite LV thrombus seen (cannot definitively
exclude). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. Compared with the report of the prior
study (images unavailable for review) of [**2099-11-13**], overall LV
function is probably similar although segmental wall  motion was
previously in a different territory. EF 35-40%.

SPEP negative
UPEP negative

Brief Hospital Course:
74 y/o male with h/o CAD, PVD, T2DM, and psoriasis who was
transferred from OSH for further management and evaluation of
possible ischemia after Troponin I was found to be elevated. The
following issues were addressed during this hospitalization.
.
1. Cardiac
The patient has no known documented history of CAD but has
numerous risk factors including T2DM and PVD. He was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH after troponin bump with the concern for
possible ischemia and need for cardiac catheterization. Upon
admission to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient had no symptoms to suggest ACS
nor did he have acute ST changes. Furthermore, the patient was
not interested in undergoing a cardiac catheterization. It was
decided to perform a stress MIBI during the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
stay. The specific results are above along with his echo
results. The stress MIBI revealed the presence of stable, fixed
lesions. Echo showed an EF of 35-40%. There was no urgent need
for cardiac catherization and the patient did not want to
undergo cardiac catheterization so the decision was made to
manage his CAD medically by optimizing his medications. He was
discharged home on a BB, ACEI, ASA, and statin. He will follow
up with a cardiologist referred by his PCP in his area. On
admission, there was a concern for a new LBBB but after
discussing the patient's case with his PCP the LBBB was indeed
not new. The etiology of the LBBB was likely secondary to
cardiomyopathy from prior ischemic events. There was an initial
concern for hypotension on transport with BP 90/60s and the
patient's home dose of Lasix was held. He was discharged on half
his home dose of Lasix with further adjustments to be made by
his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was instructed to weigh himself everyday.
.
2. Acute Renal Failure on Chronic Renal Insufficiency
After talking to the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has a baseline creatinine
of 1.65. Initially, his creatinine was elevated to 2.1
indicating ARF on CRI. The patient's acute rise in creatinine
was most likely pre-renal in origin and it slowly came back to
baseline with IVF and holding the patient's Lasix and ACEI, both
of which were re-started once his creatinine returned to
baseline. The patient also had some difficulty with urinary
retention secondary to h/o an enlarged prostate. He refused any
urinary catheterization during this admission. He was started on
Flomax for his urinary symptoms. Further workup of the patient's
urinary retention and annual digital rectal examinations will be
done per his PCP as an outpatient. The patient has a history of
an elevated ESR and SPEP, UPEP were sent.
.
3. Anemia
The patient has chronic anemia per PCP which is consistent with
both iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease. The
patient's HCT was stable throughout his entire hospital
admission.
.
4. Chronic corticosteroid use
It was unclear exactly why the patient was on chronic steroids.
