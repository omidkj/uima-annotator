Service:  Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 89-year-old male who
presented to an outside hospital on [**2102-2-4**] after a near
syncopal episode.  The patient was going to the bathroom and
fell to the floor.  There was no loss of consciousness or
traumatic injuries noted.  He remained on the floor for
several hours before Lifeline and EMTs were able to reach
him.  Full cardiac work-up showed CPKs of 400, troponin .07.
EKG showed no ST or T wave abnormalities.

The patient was admitted and was about to be discharged on
[**2102-2-6**] when he was noted to have an episodes of slurred
speech, left facial droop, listing toward the left side with
ambulation.  Head CT showed significant bilateral
frontoparietal subdural hematoma.  The image was consistent
with acute on chronic subdural hematoma.  He was transferred
to [**Hospital1 69**] for neurosurgical
evaluation and treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Mitral regurgitation, cellulitis,
chronic venous stasis, gout, pneumonia, chronic renal
insufficiency, benign prostatic hypertrophy, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, gastroesophageal reflux
disease, atrial fibrillation, gastrointestinal bleed, and
chronic anemia.  Baseline hematocrit is 33.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Digoxin 0.125 q.d.; Colchicine 0.6 mg
q.d.; allopurinol 100 mg q. day; terazosin 2 mg q day;
Protonix 40 mg q.d. and iron 325 mg q. day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Sinus rhythm with rate in the 70s,
blood pressure 140s/50, respiratory rate 20, 97% room air
saturation.  The patient was awake, alert and oriented x 3
although slow to respond.  Pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light, extraocular movements full, no nystagmus.
Tongue was slightly deviated to the right.  Face was
symmetric.  There was no pronator drift.  Strength in the
bilateral upper extremities was [**5-22**] all major muscle groups
except for triceps and wrist extension, 4+ bilaterally.
Lower extremities were [**5-22**] in all muscle groups bilaterally.
Lungs were clear to auscultation.  Cardiovascular examination
was regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, 2/6 systolic ejection
murmur at the apex.  Abdomen had positive bowel sounds, soft
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities showed no edema noted.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit was 33.  Digoxin level was 0.4.
CPK and troponin as noted.  All other laboratory studies were
within normal limits.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the intensive
care unit for close neurological assessment and blood
pressure control as well as Dilantin loading.  On [**2102-2-8**]
the patient was taken to the operating room for bilateral
parietal bur holes with evacuation of hematomas.  The patient
recovered in the intensive care unit, received one unit of
red cells for low hematocrit.  Tube feeds were initiated by
nasogastric tube until a swallowing study was completed.  The
patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day
three.  The patient developed high sodium levels with a peak
of 151.  Three water boluses were given via nasogastric tube.
Sodium corrected by postoperative day eight.

Initial swallowing evaluation on postoperative day five
recommended continued tube feedings, a follow-up study on
postoperative day eight.  The patient demonstrated the
ability to swallow thin liquids and purees.  Tube feeds were
discontinued.  He received an additional unit of packed red
blood cells again for a low hematocrit.  He was noted to have
positive guaiac stools.  GI was consulted.  They found no
active bleeding at that time.  They recommended treatment of
ulcer with proton pump inhibitors; endoscopy is not
recommended unless further bleeding occurs.  Hematocrit has
been stable for the last 48 hours.  Neurologically the
patient has done very well, awake, alert, oriented and moving
all extremities, no drift, no droop.

Physical therapy was consulted and evaluated the patient and
recommended rehabilitation.

DISPOSITION:  The patient is neurologically stable,
discharged to rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  The patient will take the same
medications as he was taking preoperatively.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] in
three to four weeks with a repeat head CT recommended and
staples out in ten days.
