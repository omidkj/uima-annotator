HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44-year-old
female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus since the
age of 10, on hemodialysis times one year, who presented to
the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Department
from an outside hospital in likely diabetic ketoacidosis with
a potassium of 8 and massive volume overload.

The patient was recently discharged from rehabilitation five
days prior to admission.  She states that she developed a
respiratory tract infection and had difficulty controlling
her sugars.  At this time, she was living with her mother.
She states that although she was checking her blood sugars
regularly, she was unable to keep them within the normal
range.  She reports blood sugars above 400.

At the outside hospital, the patient was treated with
intravenous fluids.  She was noted to have an anion gap and a
potassium of 8.  She received calcium chloride and
bicarbonate.  She also received insulin.  She became agitated
and was treated with Ativan.  She was given one dose of
vancomycin.  She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] Medical Intensive Care Unit.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was treated
with an insulin drip and hemodialysis.  On the day of
admission, she was noted to be disoriented.  However, by day
one of her hospitalization the patient's mental status had
markedly improved.  She was transferred to the floor on
[**2164-9-27**].

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
upon transfer to the floor revealed the patient's complete
blood count was stable.  Her sodium and potassium were within
normal limits.  Vancomycin level was 41.6.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed the patient's temperature was 98 degrees Fahrenheit,
her blood pressure was 150/85, her heart rate was 88, her
respiratory rate was 18, and her oxygen saturation was 100%
on room air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed the oropharynx was clear.  Pupils were equal, round,
and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements were intact.
The mucous membranes were moist.  No jugular venous
distention was appreciated.  No lymphadenopathy was
appreciated.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a 3/6
systolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border.  Chest
examination revealed the lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  No wheezes or crackles were appreciated on
examination.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Extremity examination revealed no clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema.  Neurologic examination revealed the
patient was alert and oriented times three.  She had markedly
reduced sensation in her lower extremities.  She had 5/5
strength in all extremities.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
originally to the Medical Intensive Care Unit as described in
the History of Present Illness.

On the floor, the patient's blood sugars were relatively well
controlled.  She was on a regimen which consisted of Glargine
14 units subcutaneously at night and then an insulin
sliding-scale before and two hours after meals.  This regimen
was designed by the [**Last Name (un) **] Service in consultation.

The patient continued with her Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
dialysis schedule.  The patient was seen by Podiatry who
performed an ulceration excision and closure around her left
partial calcanectomy.  The patient tolerated the procedure
well.  She was left with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain.  This drained
serosanguineous fluid.

The patient was continued on her vancomycin therapy for her
history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and
osteomyelitis.  In addition, she was continued on her
levofloxacin therapy which had been started in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit because a chest x-ray was consistent with
right lower lobe pneumonia.

On the Medicine floor, the patient continued to saturate well
on room air and was relatively asymptomatic with respect to
her right lower lobe pneumonia.

After her Podiatry surgery and after remaining stable on the
floor, it was the consensus of the medical team that the
patient was stable enough to return to her mother's house.
Thus, the patient was discharged to home with services.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home.
