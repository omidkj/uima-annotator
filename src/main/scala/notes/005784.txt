Admission Date:  [**2117-4-15**]     Discharge Date:  [**2117-4-21**]

Date of Birth:   [**2054-11-28**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year old
male with HIV and coronary risk factors including diabetes
mellitus, hyperlipidemia, family history of coronary artery
disease, and male sex, who presented to his primary care
physician with two months of progressive dyspnea on exertion.
The patient had cardiac echocardiogram which showed ejection
fraction of 20% and 3+ mitral regurgitation.  The patient was
referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 188**] for evaluation prior to elective mitral valve repair.

The patient underwent catheterization on [**2117-4-15**], which
indicated that the patient had no coronary artery disease.
His ejection fraction at this time was found to be 20% and he
was noted to have severe diffuse global hypokinesis. All this
is consistent with HIV dilated cardiomyopathy.  On
catheterization, his right atrial pressure was found to be
20/18, right ventricular pressure 46/10, pulmonary artery
pressure 45/25, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 24.
Because of this, the patient was transferred to the CCU to
maximize his congestive heart failure therapy.

The patient had presented to his primary care physician with
complaints of rapid heart rate, loss of appetite, and
fatigue.  The patient denied claudication, orthopnea,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, chest pain or light-headedness.
He had no melena, and no bright red blood per rectum.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate 95, blood pressure 102/72,
respiratory rate 20, oxygen saturation 98% on two liters.  In
general, the patient is in no acute distress and appeared
stated age.  He was resting comfortably and was alert and
oriented times three.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  Neck - jugular venous distention to
ear, no bruits.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2,
holosystolic murmur, anterolaterally displaced point of
maximal impulse.  The abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities revealed no edema.  Strong peripheral pulses.
Neurologic examination is nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, electrocardiogram showed
normal sinus rhythm, occasional sinus tachycardia.  Cardiac
catheterization performed on [**2117-4-15**], showed pulmonary
arterial pressure 46/27, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
26/29 with a mean of 24.  Cardiac output was 2.9, cardiac
index was 1.7.  After Dobutamine cardiac output rose to 3.7
and cardiac index increased to 2.2.  SVR was 1269, PVR was
248 and left ventricular ejection fraction was 21%.  Global
hypokinesis was noted.  He showed 3+ mitral regurgitation and
no coronary artery disease was noted.  He was noted to have
severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diagnosed with HIV approximately ten
years ago.  Since starting treatment for his HIV with HAART,
the patient has developed hyperlipidemia and diabetes
mellitus which is well controlled with oral medication.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Metformin 850 mg twice a day.
2.  Pravachol 10 mg once daily.
3.  Trazodone 100 mg p.o. q.h.s.
4.  Virid 300 mg once daily.
5.  Zerit 40 mg twice a day
6.  Paxil 20 mg p.o. once daily.
7.  Lisinopril 10 mg once daily.
8.  Keletra three capsules twice a day.
9.  AndroGel cream.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies drinking, no tobacco use.
He is a retired English teacher.  Hobby is gardening.  He has
been married for thirty-nine years and has two children, both
daughters ages 34 and 37.

FAMILY HISTORY:  His older brother had myocardial infarction
at age of 30.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular - The patient came to the CCU from the
cardiac catheterization laboratory.  In the catheterization
laboratory, he had been started on Dobutamine in the cardiac
catheterization laboratory before coming to us.  On hospital
day one, his pulmonary artery systolic pressure was noted to
be in the 50s.  His pulmonary artery diastolic pressures were
in the 20s to low 30s.  The patient was started on low doses
of intravenous Lasix.  He responded well and had an extensive
diuresis.  After aggressive diuresis, pulmonary artery
pressure had only increased by a modest amount.  Pulmonary
artery systolic pressures were in the high 40s and pulmonary
artery diastolic pressures were still over 25.  Lisinopril
was stopped and Captopril 25 mg three times a day was
started.  On Captopril, pulmonary artery systolic pressures
decreased to the mid 40s and pulmonary artery diastolic
pressures decreased to approximately 20 to 27.  On hospital
day three, his cardiac output was still low at 2.8 with a
cardiac index of 1.72.  The patient appeared to be mildly
orthostatic. He responded well to a fluid bolus.  His cardiac
output increased from 2.8 to 3.6 and cardiac index increased
from 1.72 to 2.21 and SVR decreased from roughly 2200 to 1350
after the fluid bolus.  Dobutamine was tapered off and was
stopped finally on hospital day four.  The patient was
started on Digoxin 0.125 mg on hospital day five.  The
patient was started on a beta blocker prior to discharge.
The patient had no complaints of shortness of breath or
dyspnea on exertion while in the hospital.  On hospital day
four, the patient was ambulating and experienced no shortness
of breath.

2.  Pulmonary - The patient was started on incentive
spirometry on hospital day one.  On hospital day three, the
patient was experiencing hoarseness and a sore throat and was
placed on humidified oxygen.  ENT consultation was obtained
to rule out hematoma compressing the vocal cords.  No
hematomas were found by ENT service.

3.  Infectious disease - The patient was afebrile during his
entire hospital course.  The patient was kept on his HIV
medications on his standard doses during his admission.

4.  Endocrine - The patient is diabetic and was noted to have
blood sugar of over 240 on the day of admission.  The patient
was started on insulin drip.  His blood glucose levels were
well maintained during his hospital stay and ranged between
90 and 120.  On hospital day six, the patient was transferred
to the floor and was switched from insulin drip to insulin
sliding scale.

5.  Gastrointestinal - The patient was started on Protonix
for gastrointestinal prophylaxis.

6.  Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition - While in house, he
required daily potassium and magnesium replacement.  The
patient was started on a two gram sodium restricted diet and
also received teaching for a heart healthy diet.

1.  Trazodone 100 mg p.o. q.h.s.
2.  Tylenol one to two tablets p.o. q4-6hours for pain.
3.  Pravastatin 10 mg p.o. once daily.
4.  Stavudine 40 mg q12hours.
