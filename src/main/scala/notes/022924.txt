Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4309**]
Chief Complaint:
"off", status post fall at [**Hospital1 **] house

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Patient is [**Age over 90 **] yo f with PMH of CVA in [**2106**] who presented to ED
on [**2117-5-11**] w/ c/o s/p fall at [**Hospital1 100**] house.  Per patient's son,
patient was noted to be fatigued and "not herself" starting 2
days prior to admission.  These vague symptoms continued, and
then patient experienced 2 falls - 1 unwitnessed day prior to
admission and 1 morning of admission.  She otherwise denied any
chest pain/pressure, SOB, palpitations, dysuria, change in bowel
habits, any other complaints.
On presentation to [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to be febrile to 103,
hypotensive with BP 70's/50's, WBC elevated at 15.8 with 90.3%
neutrophils.  CE also positive with CK = 237, MB = 18, index
7.6, trop 0.28.  U/A was + with > 50 WBC, + nitrates, + leuks,
cx not done.  Blood cultures sent - NGTD.  EKG demonstrated
atrial fibrillation (?new with HR in 90's).  CXR was
unremarkable.  Patient received 3500 cc IVF, also vanco 1g x 1,
and flagyl 500 mg x 1, asa 325 mg.
Patient was initially admitted to MICU with diagnosis of
urosepsis, NSTEMI, atrial fibrillation.  She was treated with
continued IVF and was started on levofloxacin for her urosepsis,
was maintained on aspirin (on as outpt), plavix (on as outpt),
lipitor (started here), no beta blocker in setting of
hypotension, no coumadin in setting of prior GI bleed.
Overnight in MICU patient stabilized with improvement of BP to
SBP 120's, defervesence of her fever, return to NSR with good
HR.  Patient did develop some SOB today AM and was felt to be in
some congestive heart failure from the IVF hydration.  She was
therefore diuresed with lasix 10mg IV x 1 and 20mg IV x 1 with
good UOP, currently stable respiratory status on 6L NC.
Currently patient feels well.  Denies SOB, CP/pressure, urinary
symptoms, abd symptoms, any other complaints at this time.

secondary to a fluid filled hiatal hernia although developing
atelectasis and/or pneumonia cannot be excluded.

likely representing pneumonia with new left-sided pleural
effusion and stable mild pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Urosepsis:  Patient presented with hypotension, fever,
elevated WBC, + U/A, therefore diagnosed with urosepsis.
Subsequently, blood cultures drawn at [**Hospital1 100**] home prior to
[**Hospital 228**] transfer to the hospital grew 1/4 bottles of gram
negative rods (speication and sensitivities waiting).  Initially
in the emergency department, she was treated with vancomycin and
flagyl, also received aggressive IVF hydration given her
hypotension.  She was initially placed in the ICU due to her
sepsis picture.  In the ICU, here antibiotics were changed to
levofloxacin, which she remained on throughout the remainder of
her hopital course.  She had one additional fever spike, where
flagyl was added (see below), but otherwise her WBC trended
downward, and she was discharged on levofloxacin to complete a
14 day course of antibiotics to be completed on [**2117-5-25**].
.
# Cardiac - Congestive heart failure:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is without any
known cardiac history.  However, the day following her
aggressive IVF hydration for her hypotension, she developed
symptoms of congestive heart failure, including increased O2
requirement, crackles in her lung exam, bilateral lower
extremity edema.  Therefore, as her infectious clinical status
and hypotension was resolved quickly, she was diuresed with
lasix 20mg IV PRN, to which she had good urine output.  She
slowly improved with this regimen, but remained with some
symptoms.  An ECHO was not obtained as it was not going to
change clinical managment.  A low dose ACE I was added to her
regimen.  Her respiratory status and O2 requirement slowly
improved.  She was discharged with instructions to slowly
diurese with lasix if needed (moniter renal function), continue
ACE I and titrate up as able.
.
# Shortness of breath:  The patient was successfully diuresed
several liters after transitioning out of the ICU, as above.
She likely will need further diuresis post discharge as well.
She developed a cough on [**2117-5-14**], and a repeat CXR showed a new
focal consolidation in the LLL.  While levaquin would likely
cover this as well as the UTI, we added a 10 day course of PO
flagyl to cover possible aspiration pna.  Therefore she should
complete a 14 day course of levofloxacin and 10 day course of
flagyl, both completed on [**2117-5-25**].
.
# Cardiac - Ischemia:  Patient without known cardiac disease,
but on admission, was noted to have positive cardiac enzymes
(therefore she ruled in for NSTEMI), her ultimate CK peak was in
the 600's.  Enzymes initially trended down.  However, the
patient's troponin continued to rise and fall throughout
hospital course, even though her CK continued to trend downward.
 This was thought due to the patient's congestive heart failure
status as opposed to recurrent ischemic events.  She was not
symptomatic and was without EKG changes throughout the hospital
course.  Given her age, she was not an ideal cardiac
catheterization candidate and instead she was treated medically
with aspirin, plavix and beta blocker (metoprolol which was
titrated up throughout hospital course).  An ECHO w
