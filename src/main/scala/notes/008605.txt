Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 38 yo F with CRI/ESRD on HD [**3-12**] DM admitted
with acute onset of SOB c/w hypertensive crisis leading to flash
pulm edema in setting of inc fluid intake prior to admission.

1. Pulm edema: The patient demonstrated increased troponins on
admission (0.59) which peaked at 1.09, CK 203, and there was a
question of cardiac disease in setting of diabetes and ESRD
(baseline troponin 0.2-0.3).  She was placed on ASA,
pravastatin, and a heparin drip.  Cardiac catheterization was
performed and demonstrated clean coronary arteries with no
evidence of disease. It was felt that pulmonary edema was not
due to acute ischemia but due to fluid overload due to ESRD and
dietary non adherance. Patient was continued on agressive
antihypertensive regimen and HD was continued as per her usual
outpt schedule. She experienced improvement in her clinical
symtpoms and demonstrated improvement in physical signs
including CXR and pulmonary exam.

2. HTN:  The patient's hypertension initially improved after
receiving nitro gtt in the ED, and she was transfered to the
floor without the need for nitro.  In an effort to control her
BP, she was placed on metoprolol (50 mg po BID), captopril 6.25
mg PO TID, isosorbide dinitrate 10 TID, norvasc 10 [**Hospital1 **].
Additionally, she received lasix in the ED for diuresis and
underwent dialysis on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in the
setting of fluid overload.  On discharge, her medical regimen
includes ASA 325 qd, pravastatin 20 qd, amlodipine 5 mg qd,
fosinopril 20 mg qd, atenolol 100 mg qd, imdur 30 qd, lantus 5
units sq qam.

3. ESRD: patient presented with fluid overload and tolerated HD
successfully. Electrolytes were monitored and repleted as
necessary. Patient is in the process of being evaluated for
pancreas kidney transplant. Outpt HD

4. Diabetes Type I: Patients had fluctuating blood sugars from
30 to 400s. Per pts PCP who is managing her diabetes, she does
not tolerate adgressive sliding scale and has ongoing issues
with ypoglycemia. Therefore, pt was continued on outpatient dose
of glargine (5 mg q am) and very gentle humalog sliding scale.
