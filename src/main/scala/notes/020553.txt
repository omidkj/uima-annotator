Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3290**]
Chief Complaint:
multiple falls, acute on chronic SDH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**12-15**] Right Craniotomy for SDH
[**12-21**] IVC filter
[**2207-12-31**] PEG

History of Present Illness:
This is a 63 year old Male who was switched from Cymbalta a few
months prior to Prozac and noted some dizziness and
lightheadedness episodes. The patient notes over the past 2.5
weeks he has experienced 2 falls without LOC, associated with
intermittent 6/10 intensity headaches, with gait instability,
but he did not seek medical care. His daughter lives with him.
She finally noticed he had multiple ecchymoses and chronic falls
and decided to bring him to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) **]. A CT head [**2207-12-13**]
showed a grossly stable acute on chronic Right hemispheric
subdural hematoma and scattered Right SAH; R cerebral sulcal
effacement and roughly 6 mm R-to-L MLS (was 5mm) with no
evidence of
herniation. No recent trauma or injury for at least 2 weeks. He
has a history of chronic anticoagulation for history of PE with
Coumadin (INR 17.5 on admission). Patient received oral/IV
vitamin K prior to transfer.
.
He notes chronic peripheral neuropathy with no sensation,
temperature or pain felt below the knees bilaterally, but
ongoing.

Past Medical History:
-Gout: diagnosed when patient was in his 20's. Experiences
flares regularly and is on chronic meds.
-Status post clamshell repair of PFO: presented with massive
bilateral pulmonary emboli and emboli in spleen
-Hypertension
-Hyperhomocysteinemia
-Alcohol abuse
-Cervical stenosis
-Neuropathy
-ETOH abuse

Social History:
Works as a personal consultant. Lives with 27 year old daughter
and her son. [**Name (NI) **] used to smoke, but stopped 7 years ago.
Denies current alcohol abuse, but endorses previous alcohol
abuse.

Father died from complication of abdominal surgery at 93. Mother
with brain tumor.

Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2207-12-13**]: Grossly stable acute on chronic R
hemispheric SDH and scattered R SAH; R cerebral sulcal
effacement and ~6mm R-to-L MLS (was 5mm) with no herniation
noted, final read pending, film reviewed with Neurorads.
.
CT head [**2207-12-14**]
Interval enlargement of previously visualized right subdural
hematoma with more of an acute component, more mass effect, and
a greater shift of the normally midline structures.
.
CT head [**2207-12-15**]
Interval decrease in thickness of the right convexity subdural
hematoma, which may, in part, reflect redistribution and stable
small left frontal subdural hematoma, with decreased leftward
shift of normally midline structures.
.
CT head [**2207-12-16**]
Stable overall appearance of bilateral subdural hematomas, with
stable leftward shift of the normally-midline structures.
.
GB US [**2207-12-16**]
1. Focused examination demonstrates an abnormal, sludge-filled,
distended
gallbladder with wall edema, concerning for acalculous
cholecystitis. A
hepatobiliary nuclear medicine scan with CCK may be of use if
further
assessment is desired.
2. Echogenic liver compatible with fatty infiltration. Other
forms of liver disease such as cirrhosis or fibrosis cannot be
excluded by imaging.
Evaluation for portal hypertension can be achieved with Doppler
ultrasound if desired.
.
EEG [**2207-12-16**]
This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to the presence of a
slow background which reached a maximum of 4 Hz frequency. This
is representative of a moderate to severe encephalopathy such as
can be seen in diffuse ischemia, infection, toxic/metabolic, or
other diffuse etiologies. Of note, there was significant
electrical artifact from 17:23 onward in the right hemisphere
leads. There were no clear epileptiform discharges or
electrographic seizures noted.
.
EEG [**2207-12-17**]
Showed an irregularly irregular rhythm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to the
presence
of bursts of up to one minute each of periodic lateralized
epileptiform
discharges (PLEDs) over the right central region. PLEDs are
commonly
seen in the setting of acute structural brain lesions and can
indicate
epileptogenic cortex, although no frank electrographic seizures
were
seen. The slow background also indicates a moderate to severe
encephalopathy such as seen in toxic/metabolic, ischemic, or
infectious
etiologies.
.
CT head [**2207-12-17**]
No significant change in the size of the right-sided subdural
hemorrhage
with mild mass effect on the cerebral hemisphere, cerebral edema
and shift of the midline structures to the left side along with
mass effect on the right lateral ventricles; along with a few
foci of hemorrhage in the right frontal lobe at the vertex. Mild
improvement in the post-surgical changes noted before. No new
hemorrhage noted. Continued close followup as clinically
indicated.
.
EEG [**2207-12-18**]
This video EEG telemetry was abnormal due to the presence of a
slow, disorganized background that was usually in the delta
frequency range with superimposed bursts of generalized delta
slowing, often with a bifrontal predominance. These findings
suggest the presence of a severe encephalopathy which can be due
to diffus
