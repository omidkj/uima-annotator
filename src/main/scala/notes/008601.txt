Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
Back pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
T12-L2 anterior fusion with instrumentation


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 91386**] was in his usual state of health until until
[**12-10**] when he fell from the second rung of a ladder at his home.
He had immediate and severe pain in his lower back at that time.
He says there was one moment where he was put in a chair by
first-responders and he sensed that he couldn't feel or move his
legs, but this resolved quickly on being put on a board by EMS.
He was taken to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, had his C-spine cleared for
trauma, but was found to have an unstable burst fracture of L1,
and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. He underwent transpedicular
decompression of L1, laminectomies of T11 and 12, and L2 and L3,
fusion of T10-L3, instrumentation T10-L3, and autograft on
[**12-11**].
He was discharged to rehab on [**12-16**] with weakness in his lower
extremities R>L per discharge summary, as well as some weakness
in his bilateral upper extremities. The patient reports he was
able to feel people touching his feet/legs at that time and was
able to move his toes. On [**12-18**] he was being repositioned at
rehab and heard a snapping sound in his back followed by intense
pain in his back and across his abdomen. He did not have any
loss
of sensory or motor function. He also notes an episode at rehab
where his blood pressure might have been slightly low on getting
out of bed but he says this resolved rapidly on sitting back
down.

He was readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**12-22**] because of persistent pain.
He
had an MRI at that time which revealed recurrent instability, so
he was taken back to the OR for T12-L2 reconstruction of
ankylosing spnodylitis type fracture with a lateral
trans-diaphragmatic approach. On [**12-28**] he was being positioned
for
a CXR and he heard a snap and noticed that the pain he had been
having in his back since the operation disappeared. Upon
returning to his room he noticed that he couldn't feel the nurse
touching his feet and he couldn't move his lower extremities.

Imaging:
========
MRI Thoracic and Lumbar spine [**2147-12-29**]:
1. New horizontal fracture through T10 vertebral body. The
possibility of
instability at that level cannot be ruled out. Correlate
clinically.
2. Hyperintense signal in the thoracic spinal cord at T9-T10
level which is likely due to cord infarct or progression of cord
edema.
3. Post-operative changes in the form of posterior fusion
hardware from
T10-L3 level with interbody cage at L1 level.
.
CT lumbosacral myelogram [**12-28**]: Per radiology report, evaluation
is limited from T10-T12 level. Particularly, somewhat distorted
appearance of the spinal canal and spinal cord at T9-10 level
appears to be secondary to artifacts, but given the appearance
on
axial T2 images, an actual narrowing in the region cannot be
completely excluded. If the patient's clinical and neurologic
findings correlate with the abnormality, consider CT myelography
for better assessment.
.
CT T/L spine [**12-27**]: Per radiology report, very limited study due
to streak artifact from the orthopedic hardware. There are
postsurgical changes status post T10 to L3 fusion, resection of
posterior elements and spacer. There is contrast in the
subarachnoid space extending from S1 to T6. There is no evidence
of new fracture or retropulsion. The evaluation of the spinal
canal from T8 to T10 is very limited, otherwise there no gross
evidence of cord compression at other levels. There are stable
multilevel degenerative changes. Postsurgical changes in the
posterior soft tissues. There are surgical clips in the abdomen.
There are bilateral lung infiltrates and a right pleural
effusion. MRI is recommended to evaluate for cord infarct and to
try to better visualize the T8 to T10 levels.
.
MR thoracic and lumabr spine w/o contrast [**12-22**]: Per radiology
report, evaluation is limited from T10-T12 level. Particularly,
somewhat distorted appearance of the spinal canal and spinal
cord
at T9-10 level appears to be secondary to artifacts, but given
the appearance on axial T2 images, an actual narrowing in the
region cannot be completely excluded.
.
CXR [**12-28**]: No evidence of pneumothorax. Small-to-moderate
layering
right pleural effusion.
.
CT Thoracolumbar spine [**2148-1-2**]:
Again fixation hardware is redemonstrated consistent with
transpedicular screws at T10, T11 and T12 vertebral bodi
