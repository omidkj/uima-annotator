Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3043**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy [**2163-9-12**]
Bronchoscopy with Y-stent removal [**2163-9-14**]


History of Present Illness:
Per MICU admit note, patient is a 67yo male with end stage COPD
(3L O2 NC at home), tracheobronchomalacia s/p Y-stent ([**2162**]),
squamous cell carcinoma s/p right upper lobe resection with
Cyberknife treatment ([**2158**]). Patient's Y-stent was placed
[**2163-1-26**] and complicated by cough, copious secretions requiring
multiple therapeutic aspirations. Last bronchoscopy was [**5-/2163**]
at outside hospital where patient had copious secretions that
were removed. Patient states he is compliant with Mucomyst nebs
and Mucinex, and he uses oxygen "almost constantly," always at
night. He is not, however, compliant with CPAP. Prior to this
admission, patient was feeling "full" and unable to expectorate
his
secretions for 2-3 weeks. Patient also elicits decreased
appetite, 50 lb weight loss (X 6 months) and decreased activity
tolerance. Of note, he continued to smoke 5 cigarettes a day. A
PET scan in [**6-/2163**] revealed FDG avid soft tissue mass adjacent
to right upper resection site with some avid nodes concerning
for
recurrence of lung cancer.

Per MICU admit note, patient was scheduled for bronchoscopy on
[**9-12**] at [**Hospital1 18**] for his increased secretions and mental status
changes. He was difficult to sedate, requiring 8mg versed and
200mcg fentanyl. Bronchoscopy showed no complete opacification,
right sided secretions and granulations (non-obstructing). The
patient was difficult to arouse after the procedure, with
episodic respiratory depression (O2 sat 70%) and required high
flow oxygen via non-rebreather mask. After ~5 minutes, patient
regained respiratory drive and began saturating in the 90s.
Patient was admitted to the MICU for bipap (which he did not
tolerate) prior to stent replacement and lung debridement in the
OR on [**9-14**]. Interventional pulmonary was found copious purulent
secretions around the previous stent which was removed but a new
stent could not be placed. Plan is for re-placement of the stent
in ~ 4 weeks. On call-out from the MICU, plan was to observe
patient's respiratory status, especially with ambulation, taper
his steroids over 3-4 weeks and discharge home.

ROS: Denies fevers/chills, night sweats, rhinorrhea, congestion,
chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, hematuria, dysuria.

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
major change. Asymmetry of the hemithoraces given the past
post-operative history. No newly occurred focal parenchymal
opacities suggesting pneumonia. Pre-existing minimal scarring at
the left and right lung base are unchanged. No evidence of
pleural effusion. No overhydration. No evidence of tumor
recurrence.

Brief Hospital Course:
67yo male with end stage COPD, tracheobronchomalacia s/p
Y-stent, squamous cell carcinoma s/p RUL resection with
Cyberknife treatment, s/p flex bronchoscopy admitted for COPD
exacerbation. Underwent repeat bronchoscopy today with Y-stent
removal, called out of MICU stable for observation on floor.
.
# Progressive COPD/pseudomonas bronchitis: Given history of
worsening somnolence, likely worsening hypercarbia/OSA. At
baseline, patient has tracheobronchomalacia. On initial
bronchoscopy, patient had copious secretions. He was transfered
to the ICU for BIPAP overnight, which he did not tolearate. He
was titrated down to his home 3 liters of oxygen with goal sats
88-93%. He was also treated for COPD exacerbation with
solumedrol --> prednisone and azithromycin. The plan is for a
slow taper, decreasing by 5 mg every 3 days.  He went for a
exchange of his Y-stent on [**9-14**], however, while the old stent
was removed, a new stent was not placed due to purulent
secretions. He will need to have a new silicone stent placed,
which is planned for [**10-12**]. He was also continued on
Mucomyst, Mucinex, and Advair.  Sputum and blood cx were sent.
Sputum showed moderate growth of pseudomonas that later came
back pansensitive. Pt remained afebrile but with an elevated
white count so he was started on Zosyn/Cipro ([**2163-9-15**]) for
pseudomonas infection. On day of discharge, he was transitioned
to just Cipro X7 day course due to its pansensitivity. Patient
was given albuterol/ipratropium and advised to resume CPAP at
home, avoid smoking while using supplemental oxygen.
.
# Tracheobronchomalacia: Patient was followed by Interventional
Pulmonary. He was restarted on Mucomyst and Mucinex per their
recommendations. Patient is scheduled for replacement of Y-stent
in 4 weeks as out patient, after resolution of current
infection.
.
# Leukocytosis: Likely secondary to intravenous steroids and
ongoing p
