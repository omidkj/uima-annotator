status post AVR with a porcine valve.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.

7.  Anemia.
8.  Bilateral subclavian stenosis.
9.  History of subdural hemorrhage after motor vehicle
accident.

She is primarily Russian speaking although she does understand
some English.  She lives with her husband.  She does not smoke
or drink.

Family History:
Family history is significant for a brother who died of an MI at
the age of 65.

Physical Exam:
VITALS: Temperature: 99.4, Pulse: 44, Blood pressure: 175/43,
Respiratory rate: 19, Oxygen saturation: 93% on room air.  She
was awake, alert and oriented times [**Last Name (un) 15526**], and appeared very
anxious.  She had moist mucous membranes.  Cardiac exam was a
regular rate, S1, S2, III/VI crescendo/decrescendo systolic
murmor best heard at base with radiation to carotids, no rubs or
gallops; JVD was elevated to 10 cm; [**Doctor Last Name **] A-waves were present.
 Pulmonary exam was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen
was soft, nontender, nondistended with bowel sounds present.
Extremeties were warm without cyanosis or edema and had weakly
palpable distal pulses.

EKG: Normal sinue, left axis deviation, complete heart block
with rare captured beats.

Chest x-ray: No evidence of CHF or PNA, mild atelectasis in left
lower lobe.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Complete Heart Block (CHB): She presented in CHB with rare
captured beats.  Her CHB was thought to be due to either
ischemia, infection, or fibrosis from her aortic valve
replacement.  Cardiac enzymes times three were negative and an
infection work-up was negative including urinalysis, urine
culture, blood culture, sedementation rate, and echocardiogram.
Therefore her conduction abnormality is likely secondary to
fibrosis.  A temporary pacing wire was placed through a right
internal jugular catheter on the day of admission.  A permanent
pacemaker was placed through the left subclavian once all
sources of infection were ruled out.  She was maintained on all
of her regular medications with the exception of atentolol and
nifedipine, which were held until after the pacemaker was
placed.

2.  Heart Failure:  After the placement of the temporary pacing
wire, she had an increased oxygen requirement.  A chest x-ray
showed new onset pulmonary edema consistent with heart failure
secondary to CHB.  She was diuresed with furosemide and her
oxygen requirement decreased.  She was maintained on her
outpatient dose of furosemide.

3. Coronary Artery Disease:  Her cardiac enzymes were negative
times three.  She had no evidence of ischemia.

4. Hypertension: On admission, her blood pressure reached 200
systolic.  She required a nitroglycerin drip to maintain her
pressures around 120-140 systolic.  After her permanent
pacemaker was place, she was hypertensice to 200 systolic.  Her
atenolol and nifedipine were restarted and blood pressures were
maintained between 130-150 systolic.

5. Diabetes Mellitus Type 2: Her blood glucose levels were
elevate to over 300 on admission.  She was maintained on an
insulin sliding scale; however, her sugars still remained
elevated.

6. Psychiatry: The patient was maintained on clonazepam,
mirtazipine, and paroxetine for anxiety.

7. Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition: The night of admission,
she was diuresed 1300 cc with IV lasix for heart failure.  She
still had evidence of heart failure after the initial day of
diuresis and required more diuresis with IV lasix.  Her
potassium and magnesium were repleted.  She was maintained on a
diabetic low sodium diet.

8. Prophylaxis: She received subcutaneous heparin for DVT,
Colace as a bowel regimen, pantoprazole for gastric ulcers, and
ambiem for sleep.
