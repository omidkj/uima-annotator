History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 83788**] is a 72 year-old female with pmh of DM, aortic
stenosis, dCHF, and new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation who was
admitted from cardiology clinic for CHF exacerbation and
transferred to the CCU for atrial fibrillation with RVR.

She initially experienced dyspnea with associated palpitations
in [**Month (only) 41466**]. At that time she was noted to be tachycardic to
the 140s, but with regular rhythm. She was later found to be in
AFib with RVR to the 160s and her dyspnea was attributed to her
atrial fibrillation. She was started on coumadin and metoprolol.
On [**4-12**] she had a CXR showing pulmonary edema and was started on
lasix. Her creatinine rose on this to 1.3 from 0.7. She was seen
in cardiology clinic today and was volume overloaded on exam and
tachycardic (although in sinus rhythm) so she was sent to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**]
3.

On the floor she was initially feeling well. She developed
atrial fibrillation with associated symptomatic hypotension
(systolics in the 80's). She was treated with metoprolol 2.5 mg
IV, however this was limited by hypotension so she was
cardioverted with a shock. She was also given a loading dose of
amidoarone IV and starting on an amiodarone drip.

On arrival to the CCU she was normotensive, in sinus rhythm,
without complaint.

On review of systems, she reports feelings of anxiety associated
with her palpiations. She reports significant DOE and leg edema.
She admits to feeling exhausted while on metoprolol. She also
reports chronic pain in her hips. She denies any prior history
of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis,
black stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

On cardiac review of systems, she admitted to DOE, dyspnea with
her palpiations, and leg edema. She denied any PND or orthopnea.

CXR ([**2181-4-23**]) - There has been no appreciable interval change.
Left infrahilar atelectasis and small bilateral pleural
effusions persist. Heart size is top normal. Multiple right rib
fractures are chronic. No pneumothorax.

TEE
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. Right atrial appendage ejection
velocity is good (>20 cm/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There are simple atheroma in the ascending
aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
72 year-old female with PMHx of DM, aortic stenosis, dCHF, and
new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation who was admitted from
cardiology clinic for CHF exacerbation. On the floor, she went
into AFib with RVR, became hypotensive and was emergently
cardioverted. She was transferred to the CCU, where another
cardioversion was required. Despite another cardioversion after
an Amiodarone load, she was discharged in atrial fibrillation at
96 BPM, though tolerating this rate well.

BY PROBLEM
# Atrial Fibrillation - Pt arrived on the floor and developed
RVR with inability to sustain a normal blood pressure.  She
underwent cardioversion on the floor and then was transferred to
the CCU for furhter monitoring. She was also started on
amiodarone drip when she was on the floor, which was converted
to a PO amiodarone load while she was in the CCU. Her TSH was
checked on admission and was borderline low; her thyroid
medications were held. She required - and was failed by -
another cardioversion before transfer back to the floor for a
third cardioversion, before which she developed florid pulmonary
edema. Thereafter, she had an improving fluid status and stable
blood pressure. She was discharged on Amiodarone 400 [**Hospital1 **] for one
month with 0.125 mg Digoxin,  she will then transition to once
daily amiodarone

# Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure - Likely related to
pt's atrial fibrillation. On admission, she was started on a
lasix gtt for diuresis. This was ultimately transitioned to a PO
lasix regimen. Her EF on TEE was 30-35.

# Acute Renal Failure - Prior to admission, the patient had a
bump in her creatinine in the setting of starting lasix. It was
thought that this could be pre-renal in the setting of diuresis
versus to poor forward flow in the setting of her atrial
fibrillation. Her creatinine was already improving at time time
of her admission, and it continued to improve during her
hospital course. Diuresis was continued as above.

# Diabetes - She is on metformin at home, which was initially
held [**3-13**] acute renal failure. She was placed on an ISS.
Metformin was restarted when creatinine improved.

# Hypothyroidism - The patient was not entirely clear on her
home dose. As above, TSH was borderline low on admission, and
thyroid meds were held during her CCU course. She was counselled
against taking any unregulated thyroid supplements. Her correct
thyroid dose must be determined out patient

# Dyslipidemia - continue atorvastatin
.
# Hypertension - Lisinopril was held on admission [**3-13**] acute
