History of Present Illness:
46 yo female with med hx of depression, suicide attempt, COPD,
admitted to [**Hospital3 **] [**3-9**] after being found minimallly
responsive by neighbor. She reported slipping on the ice
multiple times during the past snow storm, and reported left arm
pain and bilat LE pain. She denied CP, CT, or SOB but reported
general malaise. She took increasing doses of both trazadone and
Klonopin overnight due to insomnia from discomfort which is her
last memory. On arrival EMS found empty pill bottles of
seroquel, percocet, and trazodone and OD was suspected. In the
ED at OSH VS were stable but ABG revealed resp acidosis and they
decided to intubate her for airway protection. She was given
activated charcoal for suspected ingestion. Labs revealed an
elevated WBC 17 so she was started on ceftriaxone and
zithromycin for possible PNA. CT head also revealed a rt
parietal hypodensity. LFT revealed a transamiinitis thought to
be due to APAP so NAC was started although tox screen negative
for tylenol but positive for amphetamines. She was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-10**] where she remained intubated. In regards to
transaminitis hepatology saw the pt and recomended NAC and RUQ
U/S which revealed cirrhosis. Transaminases continued to trend
down without further intervention. Parietal hypodensity on CT
was evaluated by nuerology who recommended BP control and ASA.
Pt also had an NSTEMI on admission with trop .32 but heparin gtt
held due to parietal lesion which on [**3-14**] MRI showed slight
hemorrhagic transformation. She continued to spike fevers
despite above antibiotics so on [**3-15**] vancomycin started for
possible endocarditis and TTE showed a severly depressed EF
20-30% but no valvular lesions. CTPA was obtained to rule out PE
as source and blood, sputum and urine cultures were neg. On
admission creat mildly elevated and had high CK's suggestive of
rhabdomylosis but this resolved with IV hydration. CT thorax
showed bullae and pt had autopeep on the ventilator so was
started on IV solumedrol which was weaned to oral prednisone
after extubation. Pt was extubated on [**3-17**] and VS remained
stable. Due to neck pain which was possibly chronic ortho spine
was consulted and afte MRI spine revealed possible ligamentous
injury they recommended C-spine use until follow-up in clinic.
Psychiatry was called once pt extubated and recommended 1:1
sitter and she was called out to the floor for further medical
management.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2176-3-14**] 10:42 AM
There is an area of restricted diffusion within the right
parietal lobe. There is susceptibility within the same region on
gradient-echo images and increased T2 signal. No new areas of
restricted diffusion are seen. There is no significant mass
effect, shift of normally midline structures or hydrocephalus.
There are multiple air-fluid levels and mucosal thickening
within the maxillary and sphenoid sinuses.
There is no hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysmal
dilatation of the visualized vasculature.

Brief Hospital Course:
46F who presented with fulminant hepatitis status post likely
acetaminophen overdose (including narcotics and amphetamines)
with history of depression and suicide attempts.

CVA-PT had no residual deficits on peripheral neuro exam. CT
