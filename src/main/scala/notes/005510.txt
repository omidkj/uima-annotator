CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD W&W/O C
Tiny, hypoattenuating area within the spleen, which is too small

[**2195-9-25**] 8:12 AM Angiogram
Evaluation demonstrates a vascular mass with mural nodule in the
right cerebellar lobe. Arterial supply is largely from the right
superior cerebellar artery. Additional supply from posterior
cerebral and inferior cerebellar cannot be entirely excluded.

[**2195-9-26**] 2:54 PM MR [**Name13 (STitle) **]: MRA, MRV, WAND STUDY and STEALTH
PROTOCOL
There is an enhancing, partially cystic mass identified in the
right superior cerebellar hemisphere indenting on the pons and
the fourth ventricle. There is mild-to-moderate dilatation of
the ventricles seen. The cerebellar tonsils are low in position,
extending approximately 5 mm below the level of foramen magnum
secondary to mass effect. The mass measures 2.7 x 3.3 x 3.1 cm
in transverse, anterior posterior and superior inferior
dimensions.
MRA: Demonstrates several small abnormal vascular structures
within the mass in the right cerebellar hemisphere probably
arising from the right posterior cerebral artery.
MRV: Prominent right lateral mesencephalic vein is visualized on
the MRV of the head. No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
52M, c/o 6 months of paresthesias on the left leg MRI showed
with cerebellar mass compressing 4th ventricle . On physical
exam he was found to have a left testicular mass an ultrasound
showed a cyst.  Further malignancy work up showed a hypodense
area on spleen likely a simple pseudocyst and right lung bleb
othewise normal. A diagnositic cerebral angiogram on [**9-25**]:
Highly vascular tumor, likely hemangioblastoma.
On a [**9-26**] opthamology consulted to rule out retinal angioma
which was ruled out.
Mr [**Known lastname 63390**] case was presented to brain tumor conference and to
neurosurgeons at [**Hospital3 2576**] [**Hospital3 **] it was determined the
best course of care would be surgery to resect the tumor.
On [**10-2**] he underwent Bilateral suboccipital craniotomy for
resection of tumor using a stereotactic computer assisted
volumetric intracranial procedure and a right sided frontal EVD
placement. The procedure was approximately 17 hours long and
there were no intraoperative complications.  Postoperatively he
went to the surgical intensive care unit on steroids, an EVD
drain at 10cm above trageus.  He awoke following commands and
moving all extremeties an attempt to extubate on post-op day 1,
he was unable to maintain his airway on his own due to no gag
and he was re-intubated.  He was in the ICU for 5 days with a
right frontal EVD on a steroid taper and Mannitol Q 6 hours and
an exam of awaking briskly to voice following commands. On the
morning [**10-6**], the patient was examined on morning rounds
and was found to be awake, alert, oriented and interactive. He
was following commands. He was moving all 4 extremities and he
had no obvious focal deficit. Approximately 4 hours later Mr
[**Known lastname **] had suddenly become somnolent and unresponsive. He started
posturing to painful stimuli. The patient was taken stat to the
CAT scanner which revealed significant swelling on the posterior
fossa. The patient was therefore taken emergently back to the
operating room and had a bilateral suboccipital craniectomy,
exploration, decompression of posterior fossa, resection of
right sided cerebellar hemisphere (partial) duraplasty using
pericranial
autograft. Post-operatively he awoke and followed commands
briskly his steroid were increased and Mannitol continued with
extra doses
