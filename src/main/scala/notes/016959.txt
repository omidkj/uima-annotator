Service:  MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is an 84 year old man with
a decreasing level of alertness and speech difficulties as
well as coordination difficulties.  Over the past few weeks
and the past few days he had increasing somnolence as well.
Today he had difficulty breathing and developed a cough
productive of yellow-green phlegm.  He also developed bowel
and bladder incontinence.

The patient was seen at [**Hospital1 69**]
in [**Location (un) 620**] where he was noticed to have decreased movement in
the right arm, a temperature of 101.0 F., a heart rate of 123
and a blood pressure of 87/55 with an elevated white count to
19.9.  He had a chest x-ray showing a right lower lobe
infiltrate.

He also had a head CT scan done that showed a large left
frontal cystic mass with midline shift.  He was evaluated by
Neurosurgery upon arrival to [**Hospital1 188**] and they recommended high dose steroids and an MRI for
better evaluation of the mass.  He also was noted to have a
sodium of 153 at [**Hospital1 69**] in
[**Location (un) 620**].

The patient received four liters of normal saline at [**Hospital1 1444**] [**Location (un) 620**] and there was a
systolic blood pressure of approximately the mid 90s with
some tachycardia.

While at [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency Room
the patient developed hypotension again responsive to fluid
boluses in the Emergency Room.  He received Levaquin and
Flagyl for suspected pneumonia as well as Decadron 6 mg
intravenously q. six for increased intracranial pressure
secondary to increased intracranial mass.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Cerebrovascular accident.
2.  History of falls.
3.  Heel ulcers.
4.  Gout.
5.  Right hip replacement.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   He is a long time smoker.  He drinks
alcohol.  He lives with his son.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   Upon presentation, he had a
temperature of 101.0 F.; heart rate of 74; blood pressure of
105/60.  Heart regular.  Respirations 72 and saturation of
100% on three liters via nasal cannula.  Generally, he is a
cachectic disheveled elderly man in no apparent distress.
Pupils were 2 millimeters bilaterally, equally round and
reactive to light.  Oropharynx was mucous membranes dry.
Poor dentition.  Chest was poor breath sounds throughout.  No
crackles, no wheezes.  Cardiovascular:  Heart rate were very
faint; regular with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities revealed scars on
bilateral right thighs; no lower extremity edema.  Faint
distal pulses bilaterally.  Bilateral decubitus ulcer on the
heels.  Neurological:  He was alert and following commands.
Partially responsive to voice.  Cranial nerves II through XII
were intact.  Strength five out of five throughout.  Three
out of five in the right arm.  Sensation was grossly intact.
Deep tendon reflexes are difficult to asses.  Toes were
equivocal.  Speech without abnormalities.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count of 22.7, hematocrit of
40.0 with platelets of 344.  Sodium of 158, potassium of
5.80, chloride of 123, bicarbonate of 18.  BUN of 79,
creatinine of 3.5.  His liver function tests were normal.

He had a urinalysis that was nitrite positive.  Zero to two
white blood cells.

He had a chest x-ray which revealed a right lower lobe
infiltrate.  He had a head CT scan which revealed a large
right frontal mass with midline shift with no evidence of
intracranial bleed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit secondary to presumed sepsis and hypotension complicated
by extreme dehydration.  He was adequately rehydrated with
fluid and his blood pressure responded appropriate to normal
saline boluses.  He was also started on lactated Ringers and
free water secondary to the patient's hypernatremia.  He
required Dopamine for blood pressure support.  The patient
was noted to have some extravasation of the Dopamine
subcutaneously and was given Phentolamine to reverse the
subcutaneous infiltration of his Dopamine.  The patient's
pressures stabilized on day number two and Dopamine blood
pressure support was no longer needed.  The hypotension was
most likely related to right lower lobe pneumonia.
2.  Intracranial mass:  The patient was placed on Decadron
for supposed likely brain metastases.  He was evaluated by
Neurosurgery.  Neurosurgery felt that the patient should be
placed on steroids and have an MRI to evaluate possible
surgical options.
3.  Acute Renal Failure:  The patient had a previous
creatinine of 1.8.  He was hydrated aggressively with
appropriate response in BUN and creatinine.
4.  Hypernatremia:  This is likely secondary to dehydration.
The patient was adequately rehydrated and his sodium was
noticed to normalize.

On hospital day number two, the patient was again seen by
Neurosurgery for evaluation of his presumed metastatic lung
carcinoma to the brain.  Neurological issues on hospital day
two were brain mass with progressive neurological changes.
We continued the Decadron.  Neurosurgery recommended no
intervention secondary to poor prognosis.

Neurosurgery discussed the patient's options which included a
combination of resection with probable large deficit as an
outcome versus lung biopsy for tissue diagnosis and possible
chemotherapy versus comfort measures only.  The patient's
family decided, due to the patient's current state of health,
that comfort measures only would be the most appropriate
course of action.

It was discussed with the patient's family as well as the
neurosurgical attending as well as the Medical Intensive Care
Unit attending.  All were in agreement that comfort measures
only was a viable option for the patient.  The patient's
family decided to have the patient discharged to a Nursing
Home for Hospice care.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Fentanyl patch, 25 to 100 micrograms per hour q. 72.
2.  Morphine sulfate one to two mg buccal mucosa p.r.n.
3.  Morphine sulfate two to five mg subcutaneously p.r.n. for
comfort.
4.  Ativan 1 mg p.r.n. for comfort.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Probable lung cancer.
2.  Metastatic brain lesions.
3.  Hyponatremia.
4.  Acute renal failure.
5.  Pneumonia and secondary hypotension.
6.  Bilateral heel ulcers.
7.  Gout.

DISPOSITION:   The patient will be discharged to a Nursing
Home for comfort only measures care.
