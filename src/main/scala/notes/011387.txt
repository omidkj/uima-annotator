History of Present Illness:
Patient is 61 yo female with h/ of CAD, CABG ([**2104-2-12**],
LIMA->LAD, SVG-> OM, SVG-> left posterior descending artery,
SVG-> diagonal), Hypertension/Hyperlipidemia, and anemia, who
has been having subjective fevers, chills, malaise since 3
weeks. Given no resolution of her symptoms patient decided to
present to [**Hospital3 **] ED, where she was found to have an
intermediate Trop I of 0.18 and worsening of her in lead I, II,
V3-V6 on repeat EKG. Given significant past cardiac disease,
Aspirin was given and heparin drip was started. Patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and possible cath.
Upon arrival to ED her biomarkers were: CK198, MB3 TropT<0.01.
Her St depressions with T-wave inversions had improved and
almost returned to baseline. Throughout the course pt had no
cardiac symptoms, which she had prior to CABG. Her baseline
functional capacity remains unchanged. She is very active, no
DOE, SOB, orthopnea. No lightheadedness, dyzziness. No HA,
visual changes, anddominal pain, n/v/d. No BRBPR or melena.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
The morning after admission ([**2110-12-17**]) she went into rapid afib
with HR 150s, which was new for her. Got metoprolol 5 mg IV x 3,
HR down to 100s. Became acutely short of breath with O2 in mid
80s. CXR showed mild pulmonary edema. Put on NRB this morning.
After 4 hours on NRB, ABG was 7.37/27/53. Of note, she had
received 2.5 L of IVF and 1 unit of pRBCs in the ED by the time
of the onset of the afib with RVR. Heparin gtt was continued.
Received 40 mg of furosemide which yielded 500 cc of urine
output. She was Transferred to CCU for further management.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU, patient was still on NRB, claiming that
breathing was "better" than this morning.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2111-12-17**]  6:49:26 PM
Sinus rhythm. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the previous
tracing of [**2107-12-20**] no significant change in previously noted
findings.

ECG [**2112-10-26**]
Sinus rhythm with bigeminal ventricular premature beats.
Non-specific anterior
and lateral ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2111-12-19**]
more frequent ventricular premature beats are seen in a
bigeminal fashion.
The other findings are similar.

[**2111-12-17**] PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The patient is status
post median sternotomy and CABG. The heart is normal in size.
The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The lungs are
clear. No focal consolidation, pleural effusions or pneumothorax
is identified. Clips in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen
are compatible with prior cholecystectomy. Osseous structures
are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
.
[**2111-12-19**]: CXR  Study performed earlier the same day.

Single portable AP view of the chest was performed. Again seen
are sternotomy wires and overlying cardiac leads. There is
persistent diffuse bilateral interstitial and ground-glass
opacities, more prominent within the mid and lower lung zones
suggestive of pulmonary edema. There may be a small right
effusion which could be better seen on a lateral view. The
cardiopericardial silhouette is enlarged.
IMPRESSION: Persistent and unchanged pulmonary edema.

[**2111-12-18**]:  The left atrial volume is markedly increased
(>32ml/m2). Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the basal segments and
near akinesis of the basal to mid anterior wall and septum.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild to moderate ([**12-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent with
multi-vessel CAD. Mild to moderate MR. Mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.
.
[**2111-12-19**] CT Torso CHEST: There is mild-to-moderate coronary artery
calcification. Otherwise, the heart and great vessels are
unremarkable. There are no filling defects within the main,
segmental, or subsegmental pulmonary artery branches. There are
multiple mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to 8 mm in maximum
short axis. No hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy is
demonstrated. There are no pleural or pericardial effusions.

Lung window images demonstrate diffuse bilateral ground-glass
opacities
throughout both lungs with areas of interlobular septal
thickening compatible with a" crazy paving" pattern. There is
mild bibasilar atelectasis.

Bone window images are unremarkable.

ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: Patient is status post cholecystectomy. The
liver,
spleen, pancreas, and adrenals are unremarkable. There are
multiple bilateral hypodensities noted within both kidneys, some
of which have a wedge- shaped appearance which may be secondary
to infarctions.

There is no free intraperitoneal air or free abdominal fluid.
There are
scattered mediastinal and retroperitoneal nodes which are not
pathologically enlarged. There is moderate calcification of the
descending aorta. Loops of small bowel are unremarkable without
bowel wall thickening or obstruction.
Multiple sigmoid diverticula are identified without
diverticulitis. The colon is otherwise unremarkable. There is no
free pelvic fluid or bulky pelvic lymphadenopathy. Foley
catheter is seen within an unremarkable bladder. Calcifications
are seen within the uterus suggestive of uterine fibroids.

Bone window images are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities throughout both
lungs, some of
which have a "crazy paving" pattern with areas of interlobular
septal
thickening. The differential is wide including infection, ARDS,
or pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Pulmonary edema is thought to
be less likely secondary to the la
