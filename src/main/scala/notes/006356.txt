RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT)  [**2118-5-18**] 12:06 PM
CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT)
Reason: ISCHEMIA BILATERAL LEGS
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
70 year old woman with PVD
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
preop RT leg bypass
EXAMINATION: Peripheral vascular disease. Preop right leg
bypass.
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**2117-11-25**]:
Lungs are mildly hyperinflated. Reticulation seen best in the
central right lung probably bronchiectasis. More pronounced
oligemia in the right upper lobe could be due to emphysema.
Irregular opacities at the apices of both lungs, particularly
the left, most likely scars, but a prior radiograph should be
obtained to confirm that this is not a new finding and therefore
requiring additional evaluation.
Heart is normal size. A very small pericardial effusion is
probably present. Pulmonary vascularity and hilar and
mediastinal vessels are normal. No pleural effusion.
.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2118-5-19**] 12:11 PM
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Reason: SOB
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
70 year old woman with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
SOB
INDICATION: Shortness of breath.
CHEST, ONE VIEW: Comparison with [**2118-5-18**]. Cardiac,
mediastinal, and hilar contours are unchanged. Diffuse reticular
interstitial opacities are unchanged. Scarring at both lung
apices is unchanged. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No
focal consolidations. Osseous structures are also probably
unchanged on this poorly penetrated film.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
2. Diffuse reticular interstitial opacities suggest interstitial
disease. HRCT may be useful for further characterization.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 7257**] Vascular Surgery
Service on [**2118-5-16**].  She underwent a diagnostic abdominal
aortogram, pelvic arteriogram, bilateral lower extremity
runoffs, brachial arterial puncture with third order
catheterization on [**2118-5-17**]. For details of the operation, please
refer to the operative report.  She did well post-angiogram and
was raken to the operating room on [**2118-5-19**], where she underwent a
revision femoral-femoral bypass graft, right common femoral
endarterectomy and patch angioplasty.  For details of the
operation, please refer to the operative report.  Her
postoperative course was relatively uncomplicated.  She had a
temperature to 101.3 on POD 1 attributed to atelectasis.  She
was placed on a steroid taper immediately post-operatively and
was transitioned to PO medications.  She was deemed stable for
discharge on POD 4.  Her foley catheter was removed without
complications.  She was evaluated by physical therapy and
cleared for home.  She continued to tolerate a regular diet and
remained afebrile.  She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
