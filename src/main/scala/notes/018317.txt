HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted and was started
on intravenous vancomycin.  The patient was seen by Plastic
Surgery on [**2178-2-17**], who felt that the patient would likely
need debridement and flap closure.  The patient was taken to
the operating room on [**2178-2-18**] for sternal wound debridement.
The patient was transferred to the Unit intubated and
sedated, and the wound was dressed with wet-to-dry dressing
changes using one-quarter strength iodine packings.

On hospital day number three, the patient was started on
total parenteral nutrition.  On [**2178-2-20**], the patient returned
to the operating room for omental flap and closure of her
sternal defect.  On [**2178-2-22**], a wean to extubate was
attempted.  On [**2178-2-24**], the patient was extubated. Nitro drip
was weaned to off.  On [**2178-2-25**], the patient was reintubated
due to progressive dyspnea.  On [**2178-2-25**], the patient was
started on tube feeds and the patient's total parenteral
nutrition was weaned.

On [**2178-2-27**], the patient was extubated for the second time.
The patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit until [**2178-3-2**]
for observation due to confusion.  On [**2178-3-2**], the patient was
transferred to the floor.  The patient did well while on the
floor, and was screened for rehabilitation.  Although the
patient's oral intake increased, she was still not taking
enough calories by mouth to discontinue the tube feeds.  Tube
feeds were continued via her Dobbhoff tube.

The patient was transferred to rehabilitation on [**2178-3-6**] on
the following medications:  Amiodarone 200 mg by mouth once
daily, Flovent four puffs inhaled twice a day, Combivent
