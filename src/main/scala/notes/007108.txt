ECHO
The left and right atrium are moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
near akinesis of the entire septum with relative preservation of
the remaining segments. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
stenosis of aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of [**2176-7-9**], left ventricular systolic dysfunction
appears regional with global improvement in systolic function.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher.

PORTABLE CXR
FINDINGS: Compared with [**2178-12-19**], there has been interval
placement of a single lead right ventricular pacemaker from a
left subclavian approach. The tip of the lead projects at the
level of the right ventricular apex.
No pneumothorax or other acute process identified.
.
PA/LATERAL CXR
Single lead of the pacemaker projects over the right ventricle.
The cardiac silhouette and the mediastinal contours are normal
and unchanged. The patient is status post CABG. The lungs are
clear. The pleura are normal.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 76 year-old male with history of chronic Atrial
Fibrillation, CAD s/p CABG [**2168**], CHF (EF 30%), and COPD who
presented with progressive dyspnea. The following issues were
addressed during his hospital stay:
.
1. DYSPNEA/CONDUCTION ABNORMALITIES
Patient was initially thought to have COPD flare vs. CHF
exacerbation, and was treated with Levaquin and diuretics in the
ED. Lung exam was consistent with COPD exacerbation, but patient
also with asymptomatic bradycardia, with pulse dipping into
mid-20s on occasion. After arrival to the floor, patient
experienced episode of pulseless polymorphic VT/torsades.
Patient was defibrillated immediately with restoration of
baseline rhythm, and transferred to the CCU for closer
monitoring. Initial EKGs were notable for QT prolongation to
500s-580s. Given supratherapeutic INR in the 40s, temporary lead
wires were not placed. He was started on a dopamine drip which
did not improve cardiac function - HR remained in low 30s, with
resultant hypotension. Patient was then switched to Isopril gtt
with good effect. EP was consulted and recommendations were made
for pacemaker placement. Once COPD exacerbation and
supratherapeutic INR were adequately dealt with, patient
received single chamber [**Company 1543**] VVI pacer. Patient tolerated
procedure well. Post-pacer interrogation was successful, and CXR
confirmed proper lead placement. Patient was discharged home to
follow-up in device clinic in 1 week and EP follow-up in 1
month.
Regarding his COPD flare, patient's outpatient medications were
restored and he was started on a short 5-day prednisone taper,
with improvement in lung function. CXR was without evidence of
focal infiltrate but consistent with emphysematous changes.
Increased conspicuity in right hilum was noted on portable CXR
-- could not rule out mass, f/u CT was recommended. Repeat
PA/Lateral were without evidence of mass.  Patient was afebrile
throughout hospital course. Patient's PCP office was notified,
and patient will follow-up within 5-7 days after discharge for
further lung evaluation.  Recent dyspnea/fatigue were attributed
to both COPD flare and worsening conduction abnormalities, with
bradycardia impairing forward cardiac output (symptomatic
bradycardia). Patient reported significant improvement in
symptoms after pacemaker placement.

2. Supratherapeutic INR
Etiology unclear, as patient reportedly stopped taking his
Coumadin 1 week prior to presentation. LFTs were WNL. Patient
received several units of FFP and SC Vitamin K, with
normalization of INR after 24 hours. Coumadin was held.

3. Small Cerebellar Bleed
Given supratherapeutic INR in the 40s on presentation, patient
received a Head CT in the Emergency Department, which revealed a
small cerebellar bleed. Neurosurgery was consulted, and they
recommended immediate reversal of INR. Patient received a
follow-up CT Head in 2 days, which showed no interval change in
size of bleed. Patient was cleared by neurosurgery for
re-starting anticoagulation.
