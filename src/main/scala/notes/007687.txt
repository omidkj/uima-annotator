Chief Complaint:
thyroid goiter

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None this hospitalization


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 50762**] is a 30 year old transgender male (preferred name
[**Doctor First Name **], male pronouns) with PMH of bronchial asthma and recently
discovered large thyroid mass who presents to the ED for airway
narrowing secondary to this. Pt has been experiencing
intermittent wheezing and SOB throughout the winter, worse with
URI. He saw his PCP 2 weeks ago, noted to have enlarged thyroid
on exam and was subsequently referred to endocrine.
Endocrinology noted pt to have multinodular goiter on
examination and was clinically euthyroid. Labs were checked and
found to have TSH 0.13 with free T4 of 1.1. Per [**Name (NI) **], pt had no
dysphagia, or respiratory compromise from mass at that time. He
was referred for thyroid ultrasound and CT scan, which were both
done on [**2137-3-20**]. Subsequently his endocrinologist tried to
contact the patient given significant thyroid enlargement with
compression and significant narrowing at the trachea and
esophagus at the level of the thoracic inlet. He was
subsequently referred to the ED.
.
Denies current SOB, dysphagia, CP, n/v, fever. No family hx of
thyroid disorders.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 97.5 HR 82 BP 130/78 RR 16. Exam
notable for enlarged thyroid, speaking full sentences, appears
comfortable. Labs showed normal electrolytes and CBC. TSH was
added on and pending at the time of transfer to the ICU. UA
showed 15 WBC's and he was given cipro for presumed UTI. Surgery
was consulted, and recommended monitoring overnight in the ICU
given concern for developing respiratory compromise. For access
he has a 20g PIV. VS prior to transfer 97.7, Pulse: 87, RR: 16,
BP: 127/67, O2Sat: 100, O2Flow.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient was in no acute distress. He was
monitored overnight and improved clinically so he was called out
to the floor at this time. On arrival to the floor, he feels
well and denies any shortness of breath or throat pain.

MICROBIOLOGY DATA:
[**2137-3-21**] Urine culture - pending
[**2137-3-21**] MRSA screen - pending
.
IMAGING:
[**2137-3-1**] CHEST (PA & LAT) - No previous images. Cardiac silhouette
is within normal limits. There is no evidence of vascular
congestion, pleural effusion, or acute focal pneumonia.
.
[**2137-3-20**] THYROID U.S. - Multinodular goiter with a large dominant
nodule in the left thyroid lobe measuring 5.8 x 4.7 x 4.6 cm.
Biopsy recommended.
.
[**2137-3-20**] CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST - Significant asymmetric
enlargement of both, though predominantly left thyroid lobe with
compression and significant narrowing of the trachea and likely
esophagus at the level of the thoracic inlet. Mediastinal
lymphadenopathy. Cholelithiasis without evidence of
cholecystitis. Given contracted state of gallbladder cannot
exclude component of gallbladder wall calcifcation. No mass
identified. Recommend right upper quadrant ultrasound to further
assess.

Brief Hospital Course:
IMPRESSION: 30FTM with PMH significant only for mild persistent
asthma who presents with incidental thyroid mass, found to have
evidence of multinodular goiter and a dominant left thyroid
nodule while euthyroid, with imaging findings concerning for
airway encroachment, but with reassuring clinical exam and
stable oxygen saturations.
.
# MULTINODULAR GOITER, LARGE LEFT THYROID NODULE - The patient
presented with a thyroid mass, although nearly euthyroid on TFT
evaluation (TSH 0.24, free T4 1.1) on no thyroid hormone
replacement. Thyroid U/S and CT imaging of the neck demonstrate
a large left thyroid lobe with multinodular goiter - with
significant compression and narrowing of the trachea with
mediastinal LAD. Oxygen saturations have been stable, with
reassuring continuous pulse oximetry. Differential includes
multinodular goiter vs. thyroid adenoma vs. thyroid malignancy
(papillary would be most probable) vs. thymic tissue vs.
vascular anomaly. Biopsy had been recommended following
ultrasound, but was deferred until surgery. The Endocrine
surgery service was consulted and felt the patient was stable
for discharge with an appointment early next week for
pre-operative planning and a plan for thyroidectomy within [**1-28**]
weeks with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. The patient's Endocrinologist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**], and her PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 797**] were aware of this plan.
The patient appeared clinically stable without concern for
airway compromise on discharge. Lastly, there have been no
studies or data suggesting an adverse effect on thyroid hormone
and goiter formation in the setting of testosterone replacement,
per our literature review.
.
# ASYMPTOMATIC BACTERIURIA - He presents without symptoms of
dysuria or hematuria. Urinalysis on admission demonstrating WBC,
some leukocyte esterase. He received no antibiotics this
admission. There are no indications for asymptomatic bacteriuria
treatment in this patient and his urine culture was pending at
discharge. Given the plan for future surgical intervention, a
short course of antibiotics may be warranted if the culture is
positive for growth. He had no white count or fevers this
admission.
.
# CHOLELITHIASIS, CONTRACTED GALLBLADDER - Incidental finding on
CT imaging. No jaundice, abdominal pain or nausea, vomiting.
