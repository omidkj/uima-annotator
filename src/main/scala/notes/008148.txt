CONCLUSION: Atrophic left kidney with further shrinkage compared
to a prior study in [**2163**]. Normal size right kidney with mildly
elevated RI's but otherwise excellent flow.

No hydronephrosis.

Multiple simple cysts bilaterally.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to [**Year (4 digits) **] Surgery for angiogram.  The
patient's procedure was cancelled on [**5-22**] secondary to concern
over his creatinine.  Nephrology was consulted and renal
ultrasound performed.  With Nephrology's recommendations on
optimizing the patient, the patient went for his angiogram on
[**5-23**].  He underwent a diagnostic aortic and pelvic arteriogram
with left common and external iliac stents, ultrasound-guided
imaging for [**Month/Day (4) 1106**] access, and aortic catheterization.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well.  For further detail of the
procedure, please refer to the operative note.  Post
operatively, the patient developed hypertension to the 180's.
He was transfered to the VICU for BP management.  The patient's
blood pressure normalized and Nephrology left recommendations on
BP management.  The patient is discharged home with the
medication changes and with instruction to return on Wednesday
for an endarterectomy.  Upon discharge, the patient is afebrile
with all vitals stable, with stable blood pressure, tolerating
po feeds, ambulating, and with pain controlled on po pain
medication.
