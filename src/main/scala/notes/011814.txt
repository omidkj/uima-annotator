Dyspnea

History of Present Illness:
65 year old woman with history of PE on lifetime coumadin,
asthma, recent CABG [**4-20**] with long stay complicated by PTX, a
fib, and pleural effusions presents with nonproductive cough,
dyspnea and low grade fevers x 5 days. She saw her cardiologist
on [**2164-5-21**] and CXR confirmed left sided pleural effusion. She
was then seen by pulmonary who felt that ethis should either be
tapped, or should be considered for pleurodesis. She was then
scheduled to see CT surgery, who scheduled her to have this
tapped on Tuesday [**6-12**] but became too symptomatic to wait. Of
note, she was told to hold her coumadin on [**2164-6-6**] and take
lovenox. Initially on [**2164-6-3**] she complained of a stomach virus
with profuse vomitting then later dry heaving for a few days.
Subsequently, she developed a nonproductive cough, fever to
100.6, fatigue, malaise, and worsening dyspnea. Due to her
worsening symptoms she decided to come to the ED.
.
In the ED, the patient had the following vital signs: 97.3
103/36  111  24  97%RA. The patient was found to have a stable
left sided pleural effusion but they could not tap because of an
INR of 9. She also had a WBC count of 21. She was evaluated by
CT surgery who recommended IR guided tap once INR <2. She was
seen by cardiology who did a bedside echo that was unremarkable.
During her ED stay, she developed a fib with RVR in 170s, she
was being given lopressor 5 when she dropped her SBPs to the
70s, then fortunately spontaneously converted to sinus tach in
110s. She then later got up to go to the restroom and developed
again a fib with RVR to 180s and againwas given lopressor 5mg IV
x 2. She converted to NSR at a rate of 88 with BP of 113/77. She
remained afebrile in the ED. She was also given ceftriaxone 1gm
IV ONCE, azithromycin 500mg PO ONCE and vitamin K 5mg IV ONCE.
She was also given levoquin 750mg IV ONCE just prior to transfer
and sent to the MICU given her unstable hemodynamics.
.
ROS:
She reported palpitations only during very fast a fib. She also
reports weight loss x 1 month.
She denied any chest pain, weight gain, abdominal pain, recent
nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, calf pain, recent travel,
hemoptysis, hematemesis, black or bloody stools, dysuria,
urinary frequency, headache, neck stiffness.

Micro:
Catheter tip [**2164-6-14**]: [**Female First Name (un) **] ALBICANS, PRESUMPTIVE
IDENTIFICATION. >15 colonies,
.
Echocardiogram (TTE) [**2163-6-12**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35
%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with global hypokinesis. Mild aortic regurgitation.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-6-8**], left
ventricular systolic function is minimally improved and the
large/complex left pleural effusion is no longer visualized.
.
Left upper extremity ultrasound [**2164-6-13**]: No evidence of deep vein
thrombosis in the left arm.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast [**2164-6-14**]:
1. New hydropneumothorax in the left side with decreasing right
basilar opacity and new ground glass opacities in the left lung.

2. Decrease in size of left pleural effusion; however,
increasing size of right loculated pleural effusion.
3. No intrabdominal abscess or colitis.
.
Abdomen (supine only) [**2164-6-24**]:
1) Gastrostomy PEG-type tube. There is a small amount of free
intraperitoneal air, corresponding to the fniding on recent CXR,
which may have been introduced at the time of the recent
procedure.
2) Relative paucity of bowel gas throughout the abdomen, for
which clinical correlation is requested.
.
CXR (portable AP) [**2164-6-25**]: In comparison with study of [**6-24**], the
tracheostomy tube is unchanged, as is the central catheter and
pacemaker leads. Substantial decrease in the amount of free
intraperitoneal gas. Little overall change in the appearance of
the heart and lungs. Left hemidiaphragm is again not well seen,
suggesting substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
