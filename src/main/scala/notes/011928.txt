Laparoscopic converted to open, redo Nissen
fundoplication, and repair of hiatal hernia.
[**2124-6-16**]
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

    hematoma.
2. Endoscopy
[**2124-6-27**]
CT guided pigtail placement left pleural space
[**2124-6-27**]

History of Present Illness:
41-year-old black gentleman status post Nissen
fundoplication five years ago.  He did great during this time
with no reflux or difficulty swallowing at all.  He had
previously undergone endoscopic approaches to relieve his
heartburn, which had failed.  However, for the last two months,
he has had difficulty with some reflux as well as swallowing
water.  Endoscopy revealed a small hiatal hernia and gastritis.
A barium swallow showed a small herniation of the GE junction
possibly above the diaphragm.  He complains of these problems
with swallowing and also notes more frequent burping.


Past Medical History:
Episcleritis bilaterally: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
GERD s/p Nissen Fundoplication
Obesity
Hypercholesterolemia: Borderline in the past.
Chronically elevated liver function tests: Normal evaluation in
the past.
Chronic low back pain
Hypertension.
s/p distal biceps tear and repair on [**2119-9-8**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2719**].

Social History:
The patient states that he drinks beer occasionally on the
weekends. He smokes occasional cigars, but is exposed to
secondhand smoke at home. The patient smoked while he was in
military but quit over 10 years ago.


Family History:
Mother has a history of migraine headaches. His mother has a
history of diabetes. Uncle has a history of lung cancer. He has
four children who are all healthy.


Physical Exam:
Vital signs

Temperature of 97.2, blood pressure 143/92, O2 sat 99%, pulse
84, Resp 20, weight 236 pounds.
Breathing comfortably.
Abdomen is soft.  Incision is well healed.
Moving all extremities well.


Pertinent Results:
[**2124-6-14**]  UGI : No evidence of leak. Slow passage of contrast
from the esophagus into the stomach, likely from edema, with
residual barium within the distal esophagus.

[**2124-6-16**] CT Abd/pelvis/CTA chest :
1. Dense right lower lobe consolidation consistent with
pneumonia. Large
left pleural effusion with pleural enhancement; infection cannot
be excluded.  Small right effusion. Patchy consolidation at lung
apices suggests aspiration or infection.
2. Fluid collection in the surgical bed, extending along the
stomach and
pancreatic tail, with marked stranding in left upper quadrant.
Extraluminal hyperdense material at the GE junction may
represent surgical pledgets or extravasated contrast. Cannot
exclude anastomotic leak. Notably, however, there is no
intraperitoneal free air (endoscopy with insufflation was
performed prior to this examination to assess for leak).
3. Limited evaluation for pulmonary embolus due to timing of
contrast, but no evidence of large pulmonary embolus.
4. Peripancreatic fluid may be tracking from surgical bed, but
recommend
obtaining pancreatic enzymes for clinical correlation to exclude
pancreatitis as a cause of left upper quadrant inflammatory
change.
5. ETT terminates 1.4 cm above the carina. Consider
repositioning.
[**2124-6-17**] TTE :
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal systolic
function. Right ventricular dilation, hypertrophy, mild
hypokinesis, and severe estimated pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. These findings are consistent with a primary
chronic pulmonary process.

[**2124-6-17**] Esophagus :
 No evidence of leak at the gastric fundus to correlate with the
findings on previous CT. While it remains possible that the
density at the GE junction seen on the previous CT represents
leaked barium, given the inability to demonstrate leak on the
present examination, these densities are felt more likely to
represent hyperdense pledgets which were reportedly used in the
surgery.

[**2124-6-19**] CT Abd/pelvis : 1. Stable size and configuration of
peri-GE junction low-density fluid. No new intraabdominal
collection. Unchanged extraluminal hyperdense material, may
represent extraluminal contrast versus surgical pledgets.
2. New small-bowel obstruction with transition point in the mid
abdomen (2, 66), most likely due to adhesion.
3. Improved bilateral pleural effusions status post left chest
tube
placement. Improved but persistent bibasilar atelectasis.
4. Trace pneumomediastinum, likely expected post-surgical
change.

[**2124-6-26**] CT Abd/pelvis : 1. Interval placement of multiple
intra-abdominal drains, with persistent multiple low-density
collections within the lesser sac and peripancreatic location,
gastrohepatic space, and perisplenic regions. Though one of the
drains situated in the gastrohepatic space appears centered
within a fluid collection, the remainder of the drains do not.
2. Moderate left pleural effusion, larger in size, that is
slightly
hyperattenuating, may contain hemorrhagic or proteinacious
components.
3. Left subclavian line tip not central in location and should
be adjusted.
4. Trace free fluid in the pelvis, nonspecific, and may reflect
sequela of
recent surgery.

[**2124-7-2**] CT Abd/pelvis : 1. Interval decrease in size of
perisplenic fluid collection which contains a pigtail catheter;
decreased although persistent smaller loculations including
lesser sac, peripancreatic and gastrohepatic collection.
2. Near-resolution of a left pleural effusion which contains a
pigtail
catheter.
3. Stranding and low density within the abdominal wall
musculature,
developing collection not entirely excluded. Correlation with
physical
examination and consideration of ultrasound is suggested if an
infection is suspected in the area. The CT findings are
non-specific and may be
post-operative or due to serous or infected fluid.
4. Few subtle wedge-shaped hypodensities within the renal
parenchyma. main
differential considerations include infarction versus infection,
other
etiologies are considered less likely. Correlation with
urinalysis and other clinical factors is suggested. The areas of
relative hypoperfusion are in the upper poles only, so possibly
the appearance is secondary to nearby peripancreatic
inflammation and might not be significant in itself.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2124-6-12**] for a laparoscopic Redo
Nissen which was converted to open Nissen redo and hiatal hernia
repair. Postoperatively, he was transferred from the PACU to the
floor where over the next few days experienced an increase in
oxygen requirements with saturations in the 90s% despite
vigorous pulmonary toilet. His chest xray revealed a new large
left pleural effusion and a small right pleural effusion.  This
prompted an upper GI which ruled out a leak. His pain was
controlled with an epidural and PCA and his stomach remained
decompressed with a nasogastric tube.

On [**2124-6-16**] he was transferred to the SICU as he had more
respiratory distress and was electively intubated for airway
control and subsequent imaging. He had a CT scan of the chest,
abdomen and pelvis. This imaging study showed a large lef
