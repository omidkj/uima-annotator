History of Present Illness:
23 yo male with HIV/AIDS (last CD4 count of 2 on [**7-7**]) who
presented initially [**7-28**] with altered mental status from his
residential treatment program.  He was noted to have acute
changes in mental status 2 days prior to admission from being
fully oriented to lethargic, not oriented and not opening eyes
to command.  He also reportedly had worsening of his chronically
poor po intake, thought to be secondary to dysphagia related to
severe oral thrush.
.
Of note, he was recently admitted [**7-2**] to [**7-13**] for confusion at
which time he underwent an extensive workup and it was thought
by neuro that he most likely was suffering from HIV
encephalopathy (workup at that time included MRI brain showed
diffuse atrophy but otherwise unremarkable; total spine read as
normal.  LP negative, CSF HSV PCR neg, HSV viral load neg. CSF
JCV PCR neg. Crypto Ag neg. CMV IgG pos but IgM and viral load
neg. Toxo IgG/M neg. CSF VDRL and serum RPR neg. [**Month/Year (2) **] cultures
neg for bacteria neg while fungal and AFB are neg to date. Stool
neg for O+P, salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, crypto,
giardia; mycobacterium neg to date.  Stool was positive for c.
diff on [**2184-7-6**] at which time a 2 week course of flagyl was
initiated.
.
On initial presentation to the ED this admission, his vitals
were: T 100.1 HR 133 BP 118/77 RR 14 Sat 96% on RA. He had an LP
done which showed 2 wbc, 1 rbc, protein 122, gluc 42. Gram stain
with no PML, no microorganisms. Fluid, fungal, mycobacterial,
viral cx pending. Crypto Ag neg. He received ceftriaxone 2 g IV,
ampicillin 2 g IV, acyclovir 500 gm IV, and flagyl 500 mg IV and
admitted to general medicine service, where he was also started
on Vanco 1000 mg IV. On the medical floor, the patient was noted
to be febrile to 101.7 although his mental status improved
improved. Pt was nonverbal when he first came to the floor but
was subsequently able to give short answers although he remained
extremely lethargic with poor attention.
.
On [**8-1**], his mental status was waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**].  He became
tachypneic to the 40s and his O2 sat dropped to the 80s; BP
remained stable but HR increased to 110. Pt was placed on NRB
with improvement in O2 sat to 94% and given 2 L NS bolus with
improvement in his BP before being tx to the ICU given concern
for sepsis and respiratory distress.
.
In the ICU, he was intubated upon arrival out of concern for
hypoxia and airway protection due to his depressed mental
status.  He underwent bronchoscopy on [**8-1**] with 3+ PMNs, but
negative cultures, AFB smear, and fungal cx NGTD, PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5963**].
Additional cx data including [**Name Initial (PRE) **], urine and stool (including
c. diff x3) have been negative this admission.  In the ICU he
was started on cefepime and continued on
vanco/ampicillin/flagyl/acyclovir.  He was briefly on
voriconazole for fungal coverage which was discontinued at
recommendation of ID team; ampicillin and voriconazole both were
d/c'd on [**7-30**].  Additionally, acyclovir was discontinued on [**8-4**].
As per ID team recommendations, he was started on HAART in the
ICU.

Brief Hospital Course:
#HIV-Previous to this admission, the patient was not treated
with HAART therapy [**1-31**] depression and poor compliance; given
severity of infection he was started on HAART therapy with
darunavir, raltegravir, tenofovir, ritonavir and lamivudine per
ID recs.  He tolerated these medications well.
.
#[**Name (NI) 22118**] Pt was tachypneic on floor and given MS changes
unclear if could protect airway and adequately ventilate; thus
pt intubated on arrival to MICU.  Etiology of tachypnea unclear
but possibly related to infectious process/PCP vs CAP vs
aspiration pna.  Pt was intubated for a period of time and
underwent bronchoscopy during this admission, with 3+ PMNs but
otherwise unrevealing bronchial washings. PCP was negative from
the BAL, and fungal/viral cultures were negative.  On [**8-3**] the
patient was successfully extubated with improvement in his
respiratory status after several days of broad spectrum
antibiotic coverage for possible bacterial, viral, and fungal
infection.  A code blue was called on the evening of [**8-7**] when
Mr. [**Known lastname **] went into respiratory distress.  He was intubated and
transferred to the MICU under the MICU-green service.  A CXR
revealed collapse of his RLL from a mucous plug, with moderate
mediastinal shift.  The patient underwent urgent bronchoscopy
with removal of several right sided mucous plugs.  His right
lung was better aerated after the procedure with near complete
recovery of his mediastinal shift.  Vancomycin and cefepime were
added back to his regimen that evening given his tenuous
repsiratory state, and the BAL washings were sent for culture.
After the mucus plug was taken out, the patient's respiratory
status improved rapidly and he was able to be extubated the next
morning without difficulty.  Given this rapid respiratory
improvement, his vancomycin and cefepime were d/c and during the
remainder of his hospital course he did not have any further
respiratory issues.  He remained afebrile breathing room air.
.
#ID/[**Name (NI) 15305**] Pt has a poorly controlled HIV infection with low
CD4 count (count of 1) and thus susceptibility to many
opportunistic infections; he may have encephalitis with
opportunistic infection; LP most c/w viral infection but need to
r/o other sources.  Initially transferred to ICU with fever,
tachypnea (meets criteria for SIRS) with presumed infection (and
thus sepsis) although nothing has cultured and the so
