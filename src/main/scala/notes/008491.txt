HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital2 **] [**Hospital3 6783**] Hospital on [**2141-11-8**] for
respiratory failure.  Patient was in her usual state of
health undergoing a CT scan of the head and eyes as part as
ophthalmology workup examination and became suddenly
unresponsive with severe difficulty breathing and shortly
became apneic.  Patient was treated with Benadryl and bagged
as her respiratory failure was felt to be an allergic
reaction to IV contrast.

The patient was intubated in the Emergency Department and
treated for allergic reaction to the dye with Benadryl,
Solu-Medrol, and a H2 blocker.  In evaluating the patient's
change in mental status, respiratory failure, the patient
received a head CT scan which was negative for bleed, it just
showed atrophy.  The patient received a CT scan of the chest
which showed a 7.5 cm aortic arch aneurysm which was
compromising her trachea and right main stem bronchus.

The patient's prehospital course was also complicated by a
course of atrial fibrillation/flutter which was treated with
diltiazem drip for 24 hours, and the patient converted to
normal sinus rhythm.  Additionally, the patient had labile
hypertension in the Emergency Department with a systolic and
diastolic pressure of 200/120.  Patient was transferred to
[**Hospital3 **] Intensive Care Unit as patient was believed to be
a poor surgical candidate.  The patient is sent to receive a
stent to improve work of breathing.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Atrial fibrillation/flutter.
3. Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease.
4. Asthma.
5. Dementia.
6. History of chronic stridor.
7. A 6.5 cm thoracic aortic aneurysm in [**2138**].

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Prior thoracic and aortic aneurysmal
repair.

ALLERGIES:  IV contrast dye.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Labetalol.
2. Isordil.
3. Meclozine.
4. Albuterol.
5. Atrovent.
6. Azmacort.
7. Prednisone.
8. Doxycycline.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam, the patient is
paralyzed and sedated.  Vital signs:  Blood pressure of
130/65, pulse of 79, rate of 10 assist control 400/10 FIO2,
30% sating 100%.  The patient is normocephalic, atraumatic.
Pupils are reactive.  Patient's eyes are proptotic.  Chest:
Patient with some copious foul smelling secretions.  The
patient was kept on her current vent settings.
Cardiovascular:  Patient's examination was regular with a [**3-15**]
holosystolic murmur.  Abdomen:  Patient has positive bowel
sounds, though somewhat faint, otherwise soft without masses.
 Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Neurologically, the patient is paralyzed.

LABORATORIES:  Arterial blood gas 7.31, 44, 141.  Patient's
coags:  11.4, 30.4, INR of 1.1.  Complete blood count:  White
count of 10.4, hematocrit of 31.9, and platelets of 140.
Chem-7:  Sodium 137, potassium 4.9, chloride of 108, bicarb
25, BUN 24, creatinine of 1.1, glucose of 194.

In preparation for receiving stent to reestablish patency of
patient's trachea and bronchus, patient's copious foul
smelling secretions and mildly elevated white count with left
shift were suggestive of postobstructive pneumonia.  The
patient was started on levofloxacin and Flagyl.

Interventional Pulmonary Service was consulted.   CT surgery
was consulted to evaluate patient's appropriateness for
surgical candidate, conclusion of consult secondary to
patient's thoracic and abdominal aneurysms, the patient would
be a very poor surgical candidate.

Interventional Pulmonary Service performed flexible
bronchoscopy confirming positive distal trachea and left main
stem obstruction.  The patient received rigid bronchoscopy
with stent placement on [**2141-11-14**].  Airway showed severe
extrinsic compression of distal trachea, left main stem
bronchus, mild extrinsic compression of the right main stem
bronchus.  He had a 12 x 40 mm stent was placed in the right
main stem bronchus.  An 18 x 40 mm stent was placed in the
distal trachea.

After stent placement, extrinsic compression of the stents
was appreciated.  The lumen of both distal trachea and left
main bronchus remained patent and were expanded compared to
procedure.  Since being placed, the patient's pressure
support ventilation was weaned to 5 and 5.  The patient was
maintained on minimal ventilator support x3 additional days.
Patient's code status was further clarified with length
discussion with family and Intensive Care Unit attending
physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was agreed that patient would have wanted to
have been extubated and not ventilatory dependent.

On [**2141-11-18**], the patient was extubated and supported with
nasal oxygen.  The patient exhibited labored breathing and
was treated with Morphine for comfort.  Patient was
nonresponsive without active breathing.  Pupils were somewhat
fixed and minimally reactive.  Patient was pronounced
deceased at 4:40 pm on [**2141-11-18**].  Family was notified and
autopsy was declined.

2. Infectious Disease:  As previously mentioned, the patient
was started on levofloxacin and Flagyl.  Infectious Disease
consult was obtained.  The patient was switched to
levofloxacin and clindamycin.  Additionally, as this patient
had past medical significant for RPR and positive FTA
remained severely sedated and minimally responsive despite
minimal sedation while on ventilator.  ID staff was asked to
comment on workup for possible neurosyphilis suggesting
patient receive a lumbar puncture while in hospital.  This
was deferred until respiratory issues resolved.

For the remainder of the hospital course, the patient's white
count increased to 16 and the patient became febrile.  The
patient's respiratory cultures were positive for
gram-positive cocci in pairs, and gram-negative rods.

3. The patient's neurologic status:  As sedative medications
were weaned and the patient refused to regain neurological
status, there was concern whether the patient suffered
hypoxic brain injury as a result of her prolonged apnea
before intubation at outside hospital.  For hospital stay,
the patient continued to not have purposeful movements or
withdraw to painful stimuli.  On hospital day #5, the patient
would randomly open eyes, but would not do so to command.

Neurologic consult was obtained to assess the patient's
likelihood for recovery of mental status.  Neurology consult
concluded that the patient had extremely poor chance for
successful neurologic recovery, and most likely suffered a
major anoxic brain injury at outside hospital.  This
prognosis was discussed with family, who in consultation with
Intensive Care Unit staff felt that patient would not in the
setting of extremely low likelihood of neurologic recovery
that patient would have wanted to have been extubated.

At family's request, the patient was made comfort measures
only and was extubated on [**2141-11-18**].
