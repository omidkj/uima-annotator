Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2078**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization [**2102-4-8**]
Percutaneous coronary angioplasty with LCx stenting [**2102-4-8**]

History of Present Illness:
50 year-old woman with CAD s/p AMI and Lcx stenting (bare metal
stent) in [**2096**] admitted earlier this week [**Date range (1) 32116**] for elective
catheterization for accelerating symptoms, s/p restenting of LCx
for instent restenosis and RCA stenting (stent X 2 to mid-RCA
and stent X 1 to proximal RCA), also with HTN, DM type 2 and
positive family history, now presenting with recurrent chest
pain 2 days post PTCA.

She reports that she developed upper chest pressure this AM
while watching TV, similar to her usual anginal symptoms. She
describes it as pressure, non-radiating, approximately [**7-21**] in
intensity, associated with some SOB and diaphoresis. No N/V. She
took NTG X 2 and ASA, without relief, and presented to the [**Hospital1 18**]
ED. No pleuritic component, discomfort non-positional.

In the ED, initial vitals were HR 88, BP 123/65, RR 20, Sat 97%
on room air. EKG with non-specific changes, LBBB. First set of
enzymes negative. CXR suspicious for pneumonia. She was given
NTG X1, Lopressor 5 mg IV X3, started on Nitro gtt and Heparin
gtt, as well as Integrillin given ongoing chest discomfort. A
bedside echo was remarkable for lateral wall hypokinesis. Given
ongoing chest discomfort, recent PTCA and lateral wall
hypokinesis suspicious for stent thrombosis, Ms. [**Known lastname 15505**] was
taken to the cath lab for further evaluation.

In the cath lab, she was found to have complete occlusion of
proximal Lcx stent treated with balloon angioplasty. There was
then concern for possible dissection, and a stent was deployed.
IVUS post stent negative for dissection. Final dilation of all
stents was performed.

On history, she reports low-grade fever on Thursday up to 101.
No cough, chronic rhinorrea, no chills. Still reports residual
chest discomfort post-procedure, much improved.

EKG: NSR, rate 88. LAD, LBBB. Anterior Qs. Non-specific ST-T

CXR [**2102-4-8**]: The cardiac silhouette is in the upper limits of
normal size. There is a slight prominence of the right
mediastinal contour, but this is stable when compared to the
previous studies and most likely represent tortuosity of
vessels. There is increased density in the left retrocardiac
area, which is _____ in the left hemidiaphragm and may represent
an early pneumonia. This is new when compared to the prior
study.

IMPRESSION: Probable left lower lobe pneumonia.

CXR [**3-/2902**]: AP VIEW OF THE CHEST dated [**2102-4-10**], is
compared to the prior AP chest x-ray dated [**2102-4-8**].
Since the prior exam, there has been interval development of a
small left pleural effusion. The lungs remain clear. The cardiac
silhouette has not changed in size, in the upper limits of
normal. There is stable medistinal widening consistent with
patient's known mediastinal lipomatosis. The soft tissue and
osseous structures are unremarkable.

**************
ECHO [**2102-4-8**]: There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%); the
lateral wall appears hypokinetic in the apical window. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable
for review) of [**2101-12-12**], the lateral wall may now be
hypokinetic.

ECHO: [**2102-4-11**]: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal lateral
wall. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with mild [1+]
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is a small circumferential
pericardial effusion without evidence for hemodynamic
compromise. Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2102-4-8**], left ventricular function is similar. The pericardial
effusion may be minimally larger.

**************

Cath [**2102-4-5**]:
LMCA with mild plaquing. LAD diffusely diseased up to 40%. The
LCX revealed proximal ISRS 80-90% extending into OM1 with distal
edge 70% and subsequent 80% stenosis prior to distal major
bifurcation. The AV groove vessel was diminutive. The RCA showed
a proximal 70%, mild diffuse disease thereafter up to 80%. The
PDA had a modest 40% lesion at the origin and 50% lesions mid
vessel. A larger RPL1 had a origin 30% lesion.
2. Left ventriculography EF 48% with posterobasal hypokinesis.
3. s/p PTCA/stenting of the LCX/OM1 with overlapping Cypher DES.
s/p PTCA/stenting of the mid RCA with overlapping Cypher [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) 7930**] and of the proximal RCA.
6. The LCX and the RCA interventions were complicated by the
development
of ischemic mitral regurgitation (see PTCA comments).
