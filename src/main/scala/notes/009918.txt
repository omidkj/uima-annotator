Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**]

fever and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 26 year old female with a history of severe scoliosis
s/p recent T3-T4 spinal fusion with thoracotomy (staged
procedures on [**10-29**] and [**11-1**]).  Her post-operative course was
complicated by development of pneumonia and severe pain.  She
was discharge on [**11-12**] with plans for a two week course of
levofloxacin.  Since discharge she followed up with her
orthopedic surgeon on [**2136-11-16**] and was told that her wound was
healing well.  On the day prior to presentation she developed
fevers, myalgias and diffuse left flank and back pain as well as
body aches and a dull frontal headache. She denies photophobia
or neck stiffness. She has a cough which is worsening but
non-productive.  She has left sided pleuritic chest pain which
is slightly worsened over the past two days.  She denies sore
throat or rhinorrhea.  She has had mild gassy abdominal pain and
[**3-14**] stools per day but has been taking laxatives.  No nausea,
vomiting or constipation.  No dysuria or hematuria.  No rashes.
No indwelling lines.  Her mother and daughter have both been
sick with upper respiratory symptoms.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T: 102 P: 120 BP: 99/54 R: 20 O2 sat
97% on RA. Labs were notable for a WBC count of 4.3 with 62%
neutrophils.  She had a CT Torso which showed a left sided
infiltrate and some possible gallbladder wall edema.  She
subsequently had a RUQ ultrasound which showed a mildly
distended gallbladder but no edema.  LFTs were negative.  She
received 3 liters of normal saline, vanocycin 1 gram IV x 1,
zosyn 4.5 gm IV x 1 and dilaudid 1 mg IV x 2.  She was seen by
orthopedics who felt that her incisions appeared to be healing
well.  She was admitted to the floor for further management.
.
On arrival to the floor her blood pressure was 82/56.  She
received an additional 2 liters of normal saline without
improvement.  Blood cultures were drawn and she received
tamiflu.  The decision was made to transfer the patient to the
MICU.

Past Medical History:
Migraine
s/p spinal fusion
Scoliosis

Social History:
Moved back in with Mom prior to procedure. Former smoker.
Occasional ETOH. No illicits. Has a 6 year old daughter.

Family History:
N/C

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T:96.6 BP: 82/56 P: 102 R: 24 O2: 95 RA
General: Alert, oriented, somewhat somnolent, complaints of [**7-20**]
back pain which is improved from arriavl to the floor
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, Dry MM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales,
ronchi
CV: Tachycardic, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops
Back: Well healed, slightly erythematous incision without
fluctuance or drainage extending from thoracic to lumbar spine.

Abdomen: Tender to palpation on LUQ/LLQ, soft, non-distended,
bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no
organomegaly
Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema

Pertinent Results:
CT [**11-17**]: IMPRESSION:  1. Decreased left-sided pleural effusion
with adjacent atelectasis as compared to prior study.
2. Questionable pericholecystic fluid versus gallbladder wall
edema with
mildly distended gallbladder. Clinical correlation for
cholecystitis is
suggested. An ultrasound may be helpful in further evaluation.
3. 4.2 cm left illiac defect likely represent a bone graft donor
site, new since [**2135-10-12**].
4. Post-surgical changes of the spine.
5. 1.1-cm nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland.
Ultrasoud will be helpful for further evaluation.
6. sub-cm tracheal diverticulum, unchanged
.
RUQ U/S [**11-18**]: IMPRESSION: Gallbladder sludge with no definite
wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid. Mildly distended
gallbladder. Clinical correlation is recommended
.
Xray L-spine [**11-16**]: Spinal fusion rods traverse from
approximately the T1 level to the L3 level. There is a mild
S-shaped scoliosis. Morselized bone graft traverses the lower
thoracic and upper lumbar levels. Pedicle screws are present.
Hardware appears intact. Lumbar vertebral body height and
alignment are maintained. Disc height is grossly maintained.
Visualized lungs are clear. No appreciable change since prior
study from four days ago.

ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging
suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. No pulmonary hypertension or clinically-significant
valvular disease seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 26 year old female with recent spinal surgery who was
admitted to the intensive care unit for fevers, cough and
hypotension, found to have Influenza. A brief description of her
hospital course according to problem is described below:
.
Fever/Myalgias:  When the patient originally presented there was
concern that the constellation of fevers, tachycardia and
hypotension represented sepsis. She persistently had a good
urine output, mentated well and had a normal lactate. She
received vancomycin and zosyn in the emergency room for empiric
coverage of sepsis of unclear etiology and was initially
admitted to the ICU.  She was found to be influenza A positive.
She was started on oseltamivir and rimantidine. Her other
antibiotics were stopped after 48 hours.  Ortho was consulted
and did not believe there was an infection in her hardware and
did not recommend surgery. She was continued on oseltamivir for
5 days. She had one dose of rimantadine remaining when she was
discharged. On the day of discharge she had one set of blood
cultures from admission that were still negative, but not
finalized.
.
Hypotension: During her previous hospitalization her baseline
blood pressu
