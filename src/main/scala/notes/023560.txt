Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer intubated and ventilated

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation, ventilation

History of Present Illness:

The pt is a 54 yo female with stage III fibrosis hepatitis C
with history of cryoglobulinemia, lymphoma, h/o IVDU including
ICU stays for heroin and benzodiazepine overdose, PNA,
Candidemia, who was admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] on [**2-2**] after being found
unresponsive in her own vomit. The patient had apparently been
using heroin IV along with pills, likely Klonopin and morphine.
Her tox screen on admission was positive for opiates, cocaine,
benzos, and marijuana. In the field, the patient was hypotensive
and hypoglycemic. Her partner found her, but is it unclear how
much time had elapsed with her unresponsive before the ambulance
was called.
.
At [**Hospital1 2025**], the patient was intubated secondary to altered mental
status. The patient was profoundly hypotensive, requiring
norepinephrine to 45 and vasopressin. The likely cause of her
hypotension was septic shock; imaging showed a multifocal
pneumonia. The patient was started on very broad coverage
antibiotics for pneumonia with aspiration, along with
micafungin, given a previous history of fungemia. The patient
also received stress dose steroids. Within 24 hours, the patient
began to turn around, with lower pressor requirements. The
patient had been originally placed on ARDSnet protocol.
Microbiology was only positive for MSSA on sputum sample. The
patient's antibiotics were then tailored to
nafcillin/levofloxacin/Flagyl, the course of which will end on
[**2125-2-9**].
.
The patient has been weaned to Pressure Support with an FiO2 of
40% and a PEEP of 5. Her altered mental status has prevented her
extubation. Head CT demonstrated a left tempral gyrus
contusion/shear injury of 7mm, representing a likely old
concussion. The leading diagnosis for the patient's AMS is a
combination of her sepsis and delayed clearance of her sedative
drugs. Other contributors may include a recent hypernatremia (to
153), which is thought to be secondary to decreased free water.
The patient also has BUN rising to 60s. MRI, EEG, LP have not
yet been pursued.
.
The patient's other issues:
a. Daily fevers: The patient has dialy fevers to 101-102,
despite resolution of other septic symptoms. CT of chest and
abdomen showed multifocal pneumonia, cholelithiasis with stones
in CBD and near cystic duct. The patient's total bili is 2.8 and
has been trending upward.
b. ARF: Creatinine has normalized now.
c. Cirrhosis: INR and PTT up. Transaminases have been normal.
The patient receives lactulose and puts out good amount of stool
to the lactulose.
d. Thrombocytopenia, chronic and secondary to liver disease.
e. Psychiatric issues: Once AMS recovers, may wish to have Psych
see about addiction issues and if patient deliberately overdosed
or not.

         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
