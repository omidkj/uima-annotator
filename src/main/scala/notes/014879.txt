Pertinent Results:
ECHO Study Date of [**2116-12-15**]
The left atrium is dilated. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. LV
systolic function appears depressed with inferolateral
hypokinesis and mild hypokinesis elsewhere (estimated ejection
fraction ?40%). The aortic valve  leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild  (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly  thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an  anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad, though a loculated  anterior pericardial
effusion cannot be excluded.
*
EEG Study Date of [**2116-12-12**]
Mildly abnormal EEG with some focal slowing noted over the
right temporal region intermittently, and further anatomic
correlation
is recommended.
*
CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS W/CONTRAST [**2116-12-10**]
1. Numerous ovoid high-attenuation foci in the stomach which
could represent swallowed pills.
2. Orogastric tube tip in the distal esophagus.
3. Bilateral renal cysts.
*
CT CERVIAL SPINE
No evidence of fracture or subluxation.
*
CT HEAD
Left scalp hematoma. No evidence of an acute intracranial
hemorrhage.
*
CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE  [**2116-12-14**]
Moderate plaque with a left 40-59% and a right less than 40%
carotid stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Syncope: Unclear if pt tripped or had syncopal episode. He was
not orthostatic on examination. Initially he had bigemies and
trigeminies. However eventually he developed Afib a few days
after admission. ECHO showed LV sys function depressed with
inferolateral hypokinesis with EF of around 40%. EF unchanged
from prior ECHO done few year back at OSH.  Carotid USG shows
moderated stenosis in both Carotids. The EMS EKG tracings showed
evidence of pauses. This could have potentially caused him to
have a syncope. Read below for further management of
dysrhythmia.
.
# Afib: Per his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] had rhythm disturbances in the past but
never had Afib. During this admission, he developed Afib. He was
started on Metoprolol which was increased to 75 TID. This did
not rate control him. He was then given IV bolus of 25 mg Dilt
for rate control and then started on Dilt drip. He was later put
on 90 mg Dilt PO QID and transitioned to long acting Dilt 360 mg
QD. EP evaluated him and decided to place Dual Chamber Pacer
which was placed on [**2116-12-18**]. He was also started on Coumadin
during this admission. He will follow up with the Device clinic
at [**Hospital1 18**].
.
# UTI: Initially after admission, he developed UIT. He also had
a foley placed on admission which was D/C'ed. He was started on
Ciprofloxacin and completed a 7 day course of it. He was not
sent home on Ciprofloxacin.
.
# Rising Creatinine: on admission, his creatinine was 1.3 which
increased to 1.5 as he was on lasix intially. Lasix was then
discontinued. His creatinine remained stable at 1.5 during the
course of this admission.
.
#DOE: had DOE at baseline. ECHo was done which showed EF of 40%
with inferolateral hypokinesis. He could also have an element of
COPD. We recommended outpatient PFT's.
.
# HTN: He was continued on Atenolol, Lisinopril.
.
# Laceration: He had laceration/abrasions on his scalp from his
initial syncopal fall. He received wound care for that.
