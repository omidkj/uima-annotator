History of Present Illness:
67 year old haitian male with pmh of hypertension was admitted
from OSH after waking up this morning with acute shortness of
breath/chest pressure.
.
He had previously been well with no prior episodes of dyspnea or
chest pain. He woke up at 6:30 AM with dyspnea that
progressively worsened (after taking a shower), which prompted
him to call 911. He denied having any associated chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis. He also denied any recent
fevers, cough, or respiratory infections.
He was taken by ambulance to [**Hospital3 4107**]. His symptoms
improved on O2 administration and SL ntg in the ambulance. His
troponin I was 0.07, and CK-MB = 6 (CK = 500), and his ECG
showed a LBBB pattern. A subsequent ECG showed RBBB with AV
dissociation. He ruled in for an NSTEMI, and started on an ACS
protocol with ASA, lopressor, NT paste, plavix, integrillin, and
heparin.
He was trasferred in the PM to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU for further evaluation.
On arrival, he was in no acute distress and denied any
sob/cp/n/v. His vital signs were: 126/89, P89. 98% on 4L n/c

EKG demonstrated LBBB pattern with QS on V1/V2, with significant
change compared with prior EKG from several hours earlier in the
day which demonstrated RBBB plus left anterior fascicular block
with AV dissociation .

ECHO [**2170-7-16**]

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular  hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate  to severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %). The lateral wall  and
basal anterior wall contract best. No masses or thrombi are seen
in the  left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are  normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3)  appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic  regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no  mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary  artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial  effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with cavity
enlargement and
moderate-severe global dysfunction c/w diffuse process
(multivessel CAD,
toxin, metabolic, etc.). Preserved right ventricular systolic
function. Mild mitral regurgitation.

Clean vessels


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with acute shortness of breath
--Pump: The patient appeared euvolemic on exam, however an echo
revealed EF of 20%. The etiology of this cardiac failure is
unknown, however he is scheduled for follow up with a cardiac
MRI, coronary sinus protocol. HIV, TSH, B12 and folate, lyme
disease IgG and IgM, as well as [**Doctor First Name **] and hemochromatosis studies
were sent, results pending at the time of discharge.
--Ischemia: Due to NSTEMI. Cath revealed normal LMCA, LAD, LCX
and RCA with no disease, final complete report pending at time
of discharge . The patient was initially maintained on
atorvastatin, aspirin, heparin, ntg SL, and integrillin.  Plavix
and the statin were subsequently discontinued. The patient was
started on metoptolol and lisinopril prior to discharge.
--Rhythm: Currently patient is in NSR with lbbb. Unclear if ECG
is different from baseline. Transient ECG change with RBBB with
lafb and AV dissocation may represent transient reperfusion
arrhythmia (AIVR).

We are also setting up an [**Last Name (STitle) 648**] for an MRI of your heart
here at [**Hospital3 **].  Do not miss [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 648**] on [**8-1**]
at 10 am.

Followup Instructions:
With Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**8-14**] at 1:20pm ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 5862**].
