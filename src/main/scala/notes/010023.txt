   CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2140-10-27**]):
      REPORTED BY PHONE TO [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 30063**] @ 3:55A [**2140-10-27**].
      CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE.
         FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.
.
[**2140-10-25**] CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:
Within the visualized lung bases, there is atelectasis within
the left lung base. There is no pleural effusion. Visualized
heart and pericardium reveal no pericardial effusion.
The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are
unremarkable. Multiple
rounded hypodensities in bilateral kidneys are stable, likely
reflecting renal cysts. Patient is status post cholecystectomy.
The stomach and small bowel are unremarkable. There is
diverticulosis of the colon, without evidence of diverticulitis.
There is no evidence of acute inflammation, or secondary signs
to suggest
mesenteric ischemia. Evaluation of the intra-abdominal
vasculature reveals
moderate diffuse atherosclerotic calcification involving the
abdominal aorta, not significantly changed from prior study.
There is mild atherosclerosis at the origin of the celiac axis.
Otherwise, celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery, and inferior
mesenteric artery and their branches appear patent and
unremarkable.
There is no free air, free fluid, or pathologic adenopathy.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Urinary bladder, rectum, and
prostate are unremarkable. There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy or
free fluid.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Patient status post total right hip
replacement. No
suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions identified.

IMPRESSION: No acute intra-abdominal process identified. The
celiac axis,
SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] appear patent without thrombosis or occlusion. No
secondary
signs to suggest mesenteric ischemia identified.
.
[**2140-10-26**] L-SPINE (AP & LAT)
FINDINGS: There is a levocurvature of the mid lumbar spine.
Multilevel
anterior osteophytes are noted. The disc spaces appear largely
preserved
aside from the scoliosis. Extensive vascular calcifications are
noted. There is a right hip total arthroplasty, partially
visualized.

IMPRESSION: Multilevel degenerative changes as detailed.

[**2140-10-26**] Gastric mucosal biopsies
A.  Body: Focal active gastritis; [**Doctor Last Name 6311**] stain shows no
definite helicobacter-like organisms with satisfactory control.
B.  Antrum: No diagnostic abnormalities recognized.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Acute gastritis - The patient was admitted to the ICU overnight
for observation given reported hypotension prior to admission.
Blood pressure was readily fluid-responsive and the patient
remained hemodynamically stable. Melena resolved after admission
and hematocrit remained stable, obviating the need for blood
transfusion. He was treated with PPI gtt in the ICU which was
changed to PPI [**Hospital1 **] on the floor.  The patient [**Hospital1 1834**] EGD
showing erosive gastritis and Barrett's esophagus but no active
bleeding. Continued to hold coumadin. Aspirin was restarted in
the setting of [**Hospital1 **] PPI and carafate therapy which will be
continued after discharge at the recommendation of the
consulting GI team. He will follow up in [**Hospital **] clinic, in part to
schedule surveillance endoscopy for the monitoring of Barrett's.

.
#Candidal esophagitis - EGD also revealed candidal esophagi
