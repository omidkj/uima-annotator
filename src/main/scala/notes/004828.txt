Chief Complaint:
TRANSFER FOR ICD PLACEMENT AND PCI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ICD PLACEMENT
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION


History of Present Illness:
69F with hx CAD, LBBB, CHF with LVEF 35% and LV dysynchrony, CVA
s/p bilateral CEAs recently admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] service 3 weeks ago
for NSTEMI ([**2124-2-21**]), found to have 3VD, now transferred from
OSH w/request for BiV pacemaker placement.
.
During last admission, complex 3VD thought not amenable to
either  operative or PCI management, so she was diuresed
significantly, medically optimized, and discharged to rehab.
Readmitted to [**Hospital6 3105**] 10d ago ([**2124-3-14**]) with
another NSTEMI and CHF flare. NSTEMI p/w dizziness,
lightheadedness, nausea, jaw pain then retrosternal chest
pressure. Improved w/nitro paste in the OSH ED. CHF treatment
w/Treated w/BB limited by bradycardia to the 30s. Repeat TTE
showed LVEF 20%. One episode CP without ischemic EKG changes
overnight [**3-16**] while at [**Hospital3 **], which responded to
morphine but she developed bradycardia to HR 30s immediately
afterwards (vs baseline 70s on telemetry). No further chest
pain. Today's 4 AM labs notable for HCT 25.2 (27.5 yesterday),
Cr 1.75 (renal US wnl), troponin 1.55, CK 88, BNP 460, K 5.9.
Had been on heparin gtt which was stopped this morning. Now
transferred for BiV pacemaker placement for known LBBB and
cardiac dyssynchrony, then possible PCI by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on Monday.
Today underwent CXR-J (St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]) device without complication
today.  Transfer VS 96/45, HR 68 SR, 17, 100%/2L.

EKG [**2124-3-17**] (INITIAL EKG, POST ICD PLACEMENT)
Sinus rhythm. Ventricular pacing, probably biventricular. Since
the previous
tracing of [**2123-2-25**] bivenetricular pacing is now present.
.
[**2124-3-18**] CXR (POST-PROCEDURE)
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the right
internal jugular vein catheter has been removed. Patient has
received a new left pectoral pacemaker. The leads of the
pacemaker are in expected position.
Like on the previous radiograph, there is evidence of
mild-to-moderate fluid overload. Pleural effusions are not
present. No evidence of pneumonia.
.
[**2124-3-19**] LUE DOPPLER ULTRASOUND
FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] were performed
of the leftupper extremity, demonstrating normal color-flow and
compressibility andinternal jugular, subclavian, axillary,
basilic, and cephalic veins. Note is made of slow flow within
the left axillary vein which is mildly tortuous and patulous,
which compress normally on live exam, consistent with patent
vessel.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the left upper extremity.
.
3/19-20/[**2124**] THALLIUM VIABILITY STUDY
IMPRESSION: Moderate, mid and basilar inferolateral wall
perfusion defect whichshows no redistribution on 4-hour delayed
images. Left ventricular enlargement.
ADDENDUM: 24-hour images were obtained. The image quality is
somewhat degraded related to soft tissue attenuation and the
usual washout of thallium from the heart. However, again noted
is the moderate, mid and basilar inferolateral wall perfusion
defect. There is no delayed redistribution into this defect.
.
[**3-22**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION
1. Diagnostic coronary angiograms obtained using a 4 Fr JR 4
catheter
and a 6 Fr XBLAD 3.5 guide catheter (for right and the left
coronary
artery respectively) revealed a left dominant circulation. RCA
had an
ostial 90% stenosis. The left main was short and had a 99%
stenosis
extending into the proximal LAD which had a 90% ostial and
proximal
stenosis. The left circumflex had a diffuse 60-70%
proximal/ostial
stenosis and a 90% ostial OM1 stenosis.
2. Successful PCI to left main/LAD 99% stenosis with deployment
of a 3.0
x 16 mm Promus element drug-eluting stent.
3. Successful deployment of a 2.25 x 32 mm Promus element stent
across
the Proximal diffuse 70% stenosis in the circumflex into the 90%
ostial
OM1 stenosis.
4. Successful placement of Impella 2.5 LV support catheter into
the left
ventricle for high risk multivessel PCI, via left femoral
arterial
access site.
5. Successful preclosure of the left femoral arterial access
site with 2
Perclose proglide sute-mediated closure devices.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Critical stenosis in the left main and proximal LAD was
successfully
treated with a 3.0 x 16 mm Promus element drug-eluting stent.
3. Critical stenosis in the left circumflex and ostial OM1 was
successfully treated with a 2.25 x 32 mm Promus element
drug-eluting
stent.

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2124-2-22**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Moderately
depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.
AORTIC VALVE: Mild AS (area 1.2-1.9cm2). No AR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
