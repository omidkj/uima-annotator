Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Left femoro-popliteal catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Briefly, patient is a 62M h/o DM2, no known CAD who presented
with EKG changes in PCP office and [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/o fatigue and sent to ED.
Patient was in his USOH until one week prior to admission when
he started feeling fatigued and light headed and presented to
his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was found to have elevated blood sugar on labs and
ECG which showed ST elevations v3-6. The pt denies any CP or
SOB. He denies polyuria, polydipsia. No f/c/n/v.

    He was referred to ED for further management. In ED, he was
found to have sugar 657, trop 0.96, CK 59. He was given IVF,
insulin 10 IV, 10 SC, asa, plavix 600. He was taken to the cath
lab and the LAD was stented. On ECHO he was found to have severe
biventricular regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD and LV/RV
infarction and mural left ventricular apical thrombus.

After coming from the cath he started complaining about pain in
left lower extremity. DP and PT non-dopplerable. was taken to
cath and found to have left popliteal artery embolus. removal of
the embolus was unsuccessful, hence vascular surgery was called.
vascular surgery recommended to take the pt to the OR. Pt
declined surgery and was brought back to CCU. The LLE pain
improved and PT pulse was dopplerable. Pt was supposed to get
d/c next day.

Next day in am , he developed AMS and weakness on the left side.
Neuro was called. The CT brain w/ and w/o contrast showed right
frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Pt was transferred to Neuro
ICU. Over the last few days, his MS improved and the strength in
his left upper and lower extremity improved. Today he was
transferred to CCU to have a better control of the heart rate
and subsequent rehab.

Echo ([**2190-6-7**]):
Severe biventricular regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD and
LV/RV infarction. Mural left ventricular apical thrombus.
Dilated ascending aorta. Mild mitral regurgitation.

CATH ([**2190-6-8**]): One vessel coronary artery disease. Mild
systolic ventricular dysfunction. Successful PCI of the LAD with
Cyher drug eluting stents (see PTCA comments for details).

CATH ([**2190-6-8**]):Unsuccessful attempt in crossing the acutely
occluded LSFA

CT head w/ and w/o contrast([**2190-6-11**]):  :
Right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  Probable 5 mm
aneurysm of anterior communicating artery.  Prior infarcts,
right cerebellar hemisphere and right centrum semiovale.

MR HEAD [**2190-6-21**]:  FINDINGS: Upon reviewing the prior study, a
large, somewhat patchy area of restricted diffusion was seen
within the right posterior cerebral artery territory. While the
prior and present FLAIR images are degraded considerably by
patient motion, both examinations also showed elevated T2 signal
in portions of this infarct, suggesting that the infarct was
already subacute in age on the first scan.
The large right frontal hemorrhage is again seen. A small amount
of blood appears to be sedimenting in both occipital horns. No
other definite new abnormalities are appreciated.
CONCLUSION: Evolution of extensive right posterior cerebral
artery territory infarct. Redemonstration of large right frontal
hemorrhage with a small intraventricular component.
ADDENDUM: The study was continued with gadolinium-enhanced
images in all three planes. There does not appear to be any
overt enhancement associated with the large right frontal
hemorrhage, allowing for considerable image degradation due to
patient motion. Some of the areas of the right posterior
cerebral artery infarct do enhance, a finding consistent with
the subacute nature of this abnormality. The most prominent
areas of enhancement in the infarct relates to gyri along the
undersurface of the right temporal lobe as well as the right
occipital lobe. The gyral enhancement, once again, is consistent
with the subacute age of this infarct.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 62M h/o DM2 now with new diagnosis of CHF, EF 25% and LV
aneurysm with clot in setting of likely recent infarct. Stented
LAD [**6-8**]. After coming from the cath he started complaining
about pain in left lower extremity. DP and PT non-dopplerable.
He was taken to cath and found to have left popliteal artery
embolus. Removal of the embolus was unsuccessful, hence vascular
surgery was called. Vascular surgery recommended to take the pt
to the OR. Pt declined surgery and was brought back to CCU. The
LLE pain improved and PT pulse was dopplerable. Pt was supposed
to get discharged the next day, however the next day in the
morning he developed altered mental status and weakness on the
left side. Neuro was called. The CT brain w/ and w/o contrast
showed right frontal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Pt was
transferred to Neuro ICU. Over the last few days, his mental
status improved and the strength in his left upper and lower
extremity improved. He was subsequently transferred back to the
CCU to have a better control of the heart rate and subsequent
rehab.

[**Last Name **] problem by problem as follows:

## Cardiac:
- Ischemia: ST elevations on admission, likely secondary to LV
apical aneurysm, elevated trop and negative CK. Had LAD stented
with 3 DESs. Started on ASA 325 mg PO qd, clopidogrel 75 mg PO
qd, atorvastatin 80 mg PO qd, metoprolol long-acting 200 mg PO
bid.  No further chest pain.
- Pump: New diagnosis of CHF, EF 25% with apical aneurysm and
mural thrombus. Started standing furosemide 20 mg PO qd,
lisinopril 10 mg PO qd and metoprolol long-acting 200 mg PO bid
- Rhythm: paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with very difficult to
control rate. Started on amiodarone 200 mg PO qd, metoprolol
long-acting 200 mg PO bid and diltiazem 90 mg PO qid. Warfarin
withheld pending results of f/u head CT to make sure ICH is
stable/resolving and MRI.  On the day of discharge, repeat MRI
with natural subacute evolution of hemorrhagic stroke.  After
lengthy discussions between cardiology and Neurology, it was
felt advisable to proceed with anticoagulation (see below).

## ICH: As above, status post right frontal ICH while on
anticoagulation, also in s
