dyspnea

Central line placement x 2


History of Present Illness:
40 yo F with PMHx of AFib on coumadin, CHF EF 40%, obesity BMI
62 p/w progressive dyspnea for the last 2 months. She was
admitted in [**3-3**] with influenza and found to have afib and CHF.
She has had SOB since then and has beeen evaluated by pulmonary
and cardiology. After that admission, she has gotten slightly
better intially, but since then she has had progressively
worsening DOE. Now she can only walk about 20 feet before
becoming out of breath. She has had a cough, occ productive, for
the last few months that was relieved somewhat by starting
Adviar, but has been persistant. She has left sided chest pain
when she coughs which then lingers on for longer. No radiation
to the back, neck, or arms. She has been having orthopnea and
PND the last few nights and has noticed that her legs have been
swelling.
She has also been having large amounts of anxiety related to her
breathing. She feels that her breathing will stop suddenly since
she is so SOB. Her anxiety ahs driven her to resume ETOH the
last 2 weeks. She has been drinking 4 40oz beers per night. No
blackouts. No other substances. She has also been having sucidal
ideations since she feels she is so heavy and her medical
problems are too difficult to control, she would not like to
live longer. She has not followed through on her plans which
include drinking excessive ETOH and obtaining weapons to hurt
herself.
She has not been taking her medications the last few days since
she has been drinking ETOH and was worried about the
interactions.
.
Tonight she called EMS because of the SOB. She had an O2 sat of
85% RA when EMTs arrived and was placed on NRB. in the ED vitals
were T 99.4, HR 50, BP 132/70, RR 18, O2 sat 94% 4L. She was
given Percocet for back pain and ativan for anxiety. Ddimer was
high and she was sent for a CTA that was neg for PE. She had a
UCG that was negative. She was given levaquin for PNA seen on
CTA.
.
On admission to the floor, she had an O2 sat of 68% RA and 94 %
2L. She was able to speak in full sentances and was not in resp
distress. She was given Lasix IV without significant diuresis.
Approximately 6:45 in the AM, she was noted by the RN to be
increasingly hypoxic while taking off her O2 and was
diaphoretic. ABG was 7.22/100/76 on 4L NC. She was given a neb,
Lasix 20 IV, and CXR was ordered. MICU transfer was initiated.
.
ROS: + for nightly nightsweats which her PCP told her was from
menopause. + chronic back pain and pain in her feet. + for
nausea and vomiting daily for the last 4 days. non-bloody. +
diarrhea 4x per day for the last 4 days as well. Occ blood
streaked stool. no melana. No syncope.

cta chest [**5-23**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Enlarging small right pleural effusion with right lower lobe
atelectasis versus infiltrate.
2. Stable marked cardiomegaly.
3. No pulmonary embolus.
.
ct neck [**5-31**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Soft tissue stranding and lymphadenopathy in the tissues
anterior and contiguous with the thyroid, which is similar to
what was seen in [**12-29**], but again suggesting acute inflammation.
2. Marked soft tissue swelling involving the entire pharynx, as
well as the supraglottic and the upper infraglottic airway.
2. No organized fluid collection identified or bony involvement.
.
[**5-31**] ct sinus:
IMPRESSION: Although endotracheal intubation confounds
interpretation, extensive opacification with multiple air-fluid
levels among the paranasal sinuses can be seen in pansinusitis.
No evidence of associated bony destruction.
.
ECHO [**2184-6-15**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity  size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical  quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The aortic  valve
leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion.
No  aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild  (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure  could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
  IMPRESSION: Mild mitral regurgitation with grossly normal
valve morphology.  Preserved global biventricular systolic
function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-2-28**], the
severity of  tricuspid regurgitation may be lower (technical
quality is suboptimal on both  studies). The severity of mitral
regurgitation is similar. Left ventricular  systolic function
was likely underestimated on the prior study.


Brief Hospital Course:
40 year old female with morbid obesity, CHF, and atrial
fibrillation here with progressive SOB, and ETOH relapse.
.
# Dyspnea/hypercarbic respitory failure: The patient has poor
pulmonary status which is multifactorial from heart failure,
obesity induced restrictive disease, and resultant
obesity-hypoventilation syndrome. The patient presented with
hyp
