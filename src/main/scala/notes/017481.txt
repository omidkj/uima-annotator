Echo

Conclusions:
The estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg. There is mild
regional left   ventricular systolic dysfunction with
infero-lateral hypokinesis. Right  ventricular systolic function
is borderline normal. The mitral valve leaflets  are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is no
systolic  anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate ([**2-2**]+) mitral  regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-8-30**],
infero-lateral  hypokinesis is new. The overall LVEF is now
mildly depressed.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted after follow up appointment with Vascular surgeon

BP control

Pt had pre - op workup.

Cleared by Cardiology (High Risk)

Dobutaamine stress echo:

Borderline/equivocal ST-T wave changes with increasing
atrial ectopy, intermittent atrial flutter and SVT with
anginal-type
symptoms. Normal hemodynamic response to exercise.

Equivocal/borderline ECG changes in the absence of 2D
echocardiographic evidence of inducible ischemia to achieved
pharmacologic
stress. Normal hemodynamic response to dobutamine. Mild mitral
regurgitation
at rest.

Had hypoxia pre-op / Pulmonology Cunsult

Short course (3 days) of prednisone, levofloxacin, tiotropium,
advair. She improved significantly over the weekend, and was
