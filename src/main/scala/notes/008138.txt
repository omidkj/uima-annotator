to [**Hospital1 18**] for tachycardia and chest pain, most recently on [**10-25**]
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service for chest pain that was deemed
musculoskeletal.

systolic. Patient complained of headache and seeing spots in her

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 yoF with multiple medical problems who
presented with hypotension after dialysis.
.
#. Hypotension: Improved prior to arrival in MICU, patient
mentating well. Baseline SBP 105-120. Hypotension was most
likely secondary to volume removal at HD. She currently has no
signs to suggest sepsis or cardiogenic shock, but given history
of multiple infections CXR and blood cultures were done and
showed no evidence of infection. Of note, repeated blood
pressure measurements varied widely over short time intervals,
indicating likely false cuff readings.  Leg cuff measurements
seemed to be more accure.
.
#. History of atrial tachycardia: Currently NSR in the 80s.
Tachyarrhythmia was likely secondary to her pulmonary
hypertension. Amiodarone was continued at home dose.
.
# diastolic CHF and pulmonary artery hypertension: Patient
appeared euvolemic and required only her home 2L NC O2.
.
#. history of DVT: On chronic anticoagulation for numerous upper
and lower DVTs. Admission INR therapeutic.  Coumadin was
continued at home dose.
.
#. L arm and leg pain: chronic, unclear etiology. Patient states
tylenol q4h has helped.  LFTs were checked and were normal.
Tylenol was continued. Xrays of the L hip and left shoulder were
done and will need to be followed up by
.
#. ESRD, [**2-18**] DM: on HD T-Th-Sat; likely over dialyzed the day of
admission Patient states that weight fell from 131 to 126kg
during dialysis, but this may be an exaggeration.  Renal was
consulted and will discuss limitation of future volume removal
with [**Location (un) **]. Sevelamer was continued.
.
#. DEPRESSION:  Paxil was continued.
.
#. GERD:  PPI was continued.
.
#. DM:  Home insulin regimen was continued.  ASA and statin for
primary prevention were continued.
.
Full code status was confirmed with patient.
