Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 45**]
Chief Complaint:
Bradycardia, anuria

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
N/A

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 89yo male with history of CHD, PAD, [**Hospital **]
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with bradycardia and anuria.
.
He presented to OSH with increased fatigue and not feeling well.
 He was found to be bradycardic to the 40s in the ambulance so
he was given 0.5mg atropine prior to arrival to the OSH.  While
in the ED, vital signs showed HR in 40s and BP 110/80.  EKG
showed wide-complex rhythm with HR of 46.  Patient's home
lopressor and digoxin were held (he has not received them in >30
hours).  He was not given any other doses of atropine while at
OSH.  He remained bradycardic there (40s-60s) with generally
well-maintained pressures.  He had an episode of hypotensio down
to 85/40 that responded well to 1L NS bolus.  Pressures remained
above 110 after that.
.
Labs were pertinent for K of 5.8, Cr of 1.2 and troponin of
0.07.  UA concerning for UTI so she was given ceftriaxone.
While at OSH, patient had minimal UOP (205cc urine output today,
30cc from last night).  [**Name (NI) **] wife reports excellent urine
output on Saturday.  Denies any hematuria at that time.  He
developed hematuria on Sunday that worsened on Monday.
.
Given lack of ICU level beds at OSH, patient transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  Of note, patient had IVC filter
placed here in [**Month (only) 547**] after being diagnosed with DVT.
.
Upon transfer, patient was asymptomatic.  HR was 57 on arrival
to the floor.  Vitals signs- T- 97.3, HR- 57, BP- 106/36, RR-
24, SaO2- 97% on 3L NC.  Denied dizziness, headache, chest pain,
shortness of breath, palipations, syncope.  Also denies any
vision changes, including seeing halos.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiology Report	ECG	Study Date of [**2180-7-11**]  11:43:10 PM

Sinus bradycardia with occasional ventricular premature beats at
a rate of 49. Marked low voltage throughout the tracing. Poor R
wave progression in
leads V1-V6. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2180-5-26**] no
diagnostic interim change.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2180-7-13**] at 8:14:01 AM

The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior hypokinesis and
inferolateral akinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular free
wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**2-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity
is increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2190-5-24**],
the severity of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmnonary artery
systolic hypertension has increased.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2180-7-12**] 11:38 AM

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, today's image
is limited by respiratory motion artifacts. Unchanged moderate
cardiomegaly, no evidence of overt pulmonary edema. The presence
of minimal pleural effusions cannot be excluded. No newly
appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.

	DUPLEX DOP ABD/PEL LIMITED	Study Date of [**2180-7-12**] 9:30 AM

RENAL ULTRASOUND: Right kidney measures 12.7 cm. The left kidney
measures 11 cm. There are bilateral anechoic renal lesions,
likely represent simple
cysts. The largest on the right measures 2.9 x 2.3 x 2.4 cm in
the upper pole and the largest on the left in the lower pole
measures 2.4 x 2.2 x 2.7 cm. There is no hydronephrosis, mass or
stone.

RENAL DOPPLER: There is normal acceleration time in the main
renal arteries
at therenal hila, and the kidneys show no evidence of renal
artery stenosis.
The RI could not be evaluated due to continued respiratory
motion. A Foley
catheter is seen in the bladder.


IMPRESSION: Bilateral simple renal cysts without hydronephrosis
or mass.
Equally vascularized kidneys and no evidence of renal artery
stenosis.

DISCHARGE LABS:


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 41476**] is an 89 year old gentleman with history of CAD s/p
PCI, Afib previously on digoxin and metoprolol, recurrent VTE;
presented with bradycardia and ARF, admitted to MICU then
transferred to cardiology floor.

# Bradycardia:
Patient was admitted to MICU from OSH on [**2180-7-11**].  On admission,
he was bradycardic in the 40s and asymptomatic.  His home
metoprolol and digoxin had been held for > 30 hours at this
point.  He was monitored on telemetry and given IV fluids in the
setting of his anuria.  HR improved overnight and he was seen by
the EP team in the morning.  Given the improvement in his HR and
BP, they recommend
