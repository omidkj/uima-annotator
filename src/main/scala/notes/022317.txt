Brief Hospital Course:
.
[**Age over 90 **] F with CMY (EF 40%), PAF, asthma, who despite influenza
vaccination was found down and developed influenza A and
retrocardiac infiltrate and required mechanical ventilation,
volume repletion, and management of anxiety to prevent paroxysms
of severe hypertension/flash pulmonary edema.
.
ICU COURSE:
.
1. Sepsis: Secondary to CAP vs UTI in setting of Influenza A
-Managed with IVF (500cc boluses), following urine output/MVO2.
Eventually required levophed and vasopressin which were weaned
over time with volume repletion.
- Started in MICU on zosyn and levofloxacin, but zosyn d/c'd on
day 4 after negative cultures and presumed CAP.
- Negative [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim response; started on empiric dexamethasone.
- Required vasopressin/levophed initially and weaned off on
[**1-7**].
- Held BP meds initially in context of sepsis.
.
2. Resp failure: Felt to be secondary to PNA, although PNA was
never confirmed by CXR (bact CAP vs influenza vs aspiration
PNA). Influenza DFA was positive.
-Abx as above. Since no gram + sputum, did not add Vanco.
-Lung protective ventillation, AC ventilation. Struggled with
pressure support transition and had number of good spontaneous
breathing trials but became anxious after too long on trials.
Eventually, had direct extubation, which was successful except
for marked anxiety causing hypertension, flash pulmonary edema
and requiring BiPAP briefly. She benefitted from haldol and then
zyprexa for anti-anxiety.  She has been stable on zyprexa 5 mg
tid.
.
3. AFIB: DC CV was considered for PAF which developed during
period of ventilation because the patient was persistently
hypotensive.  Amiodarone, her outpatient regimen, was continued.
There was no evidence of ischemia. Afib was likely sec to high
catecholamine state in sepsis. Heparin gtt was avoided because
of hx of falls. The HR improved with IVF and treatment of
sepsis. Dig loaded but then d/c'd because was stable from
respiratory standpoint to add metoprolol(stable without
brochospasm on outpatient 12.5 po tid), which she tolerated
well.
.
4. Ischemic CM: has mild CHF. Trop leak of 0.12. On asa,
lipitor. Initially held beta blocker for hypotension but
eventually was able to add back. Old [**Month/Year (2) **] shows WMA, but this
event thought to be demand ischemia in setting of sepsis and so
cath was deferred.  Repeat [**Month/Year (2) **] showed EF of 55%.  Anxiety and
panic attacks frequently caused hypertension above SBP 220 and
flash pulmonary edema on the substrate of the patient's CM.  NTG
drip and hydralazine were important for afterload reduction
.
5. Metab acidosis: Sec to sepsis; improved with IVF, abx.
.
6. FEN: Tubefeeds started on [**1-7**]. Had some abd bloating,
treated with enemas and lactulose with success.
Post-intubation, speech pathology recommended ground thick
nectar liquids, soft ground solids, meds crushed with
applesauce.  D5W 80cc/hr running for hypernatremia in setting of
diuresis (often needed for anxiety-induced flash pulmonary
edema).
.
6. CRF: Cr at baseline after volume repletion, but eventually
diuresed causing some prerenal physiology (FeUrea <30).
.
7. Proph: SQ hep; PPI. On Lactulose for FOS on KUB.
.
FLOOR COURSE:
.
In summary, on presentation to the floor, the patient is a [**Age over 90 **]
year old female with multiple medical problems, including
ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 40%), paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, CRI (Cr 2.1), and asthma, who was brought to the
ED at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2155-12-7**] after being found minimally responsive
at home.  She was admitted to the MICU with respiratory failure
and shock.  She was intubated and initiated on the MUST
protocol.  She was initially treated with Zosyn and Levofloxacin
for likely community acquired pneumonia.  She was placed on
steroids for treatment of  asthma exacerbation. On [**1-7**], she
was found to have influenza A, and she was started on
amantadine.  On [**1-7**], her Zosyn was discontinued, and she was
off pressors.  On [**1-14**], the patient was extubated.  Per the MICU
team, she has had numerous episodes of anxiety-related
hypertension with SBP>220.  These episodes have resolved with
administration of Lasix,  Hydralazine, Zyprexa, and nitrates.
.
1. Influenza A/Pneumonia: DFA POS for Influenza A.  Pt had
completed a seven day course of Levofloxacin.
-Continued supplemental O2. O2 sat at baseline on the floor was
initially around 94% on 4L, weaned down to 93-96% on 2L. At
discharge, her RA O2 sats ranged btw 90-94%RA.
-Bronchodilators were continued as needed. Pt was often
appreciated to have wheezes on physical exam and benefited from
inhalers and frequent nebulizer tre
