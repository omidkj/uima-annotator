Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Codeine / Ativan

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 398**]
Chief Complaint:
Cardiopulmonary arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy and G-tube on [**2167-2-5**]
L PICC on [**2167-1-27**]

History of Present Illness:
This is an 81 y/o female with history of obesity, HTN, IDDM, who
presented to the ED with cardiac arrest after having a witnessed
collapse earlier today. Per daughter, patient was doing well at
her baseline until yesterday night, when patient was in the
bathroom to take her insulin. Her daughter went into the
bathroom to administer the insulin when all of a sudden the
patient fell backwards and collapsed (she was sitting on the
toilet). EMS was activated, who upon arrival found the patient
to be asystolic. CPR was initiated and recheck of the rhythm
revealed bradycardia and hypotension. She was intubated in the
field and brought to the ED at [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On arrival to the ED here, SBP's were in the 60's and pulses
were thready. Initial vent settings were AC 400x16, FiO2 100%,
PEEP 5 with ABG of 7.17/99/85/38. She received 3 L NS in the ED.
Dopamine gtt was started with response to SBP's in the 110's,
dopamine was attempted to be weaned off, however pt's BP fell
off dopamine so it was restarted. A right femoral CVL was
placed. Pt was given 2 gm of CTX and 500 mg of Azithromycin for
consolidation seen in LUL. CXR also demonstrated a low ETT,
which was pulled back appropriately. CTA negative for PE. CT
torso significant for LUL consolidation only. CT spine clear.
.
Per family, the pt had GI symptoms of primarily diarrhea last
week, without any fevers, abd pain, n/v. This had resolved, but
for the last two days, the pt had been complaining of SOB,
primarily difficulty breathing when laying down (+orthopnea,
+PND). No chest pain, LH/dizziness, diaphoresis. No prior h/o
lung disease or cardiac history. Has not had these symptoms
previously.

Past Medical History:
1. HTN
2. DM - on insulin
3. Lymphoma, s/p chemotherapy several years ago and s/p XRT
[**11-12**] (unclear where radiation was targeted to) - followed at
[**Hospital1 2025**]\
4. Glaucoma
5. Cataracts, baseline anisocoria (R pupil<L pupil)

Social History:

CT Torso ([**2167-1-21**])
1. Traumatic stranding anterior to thyroid. No fractures.
2. Extremely limited examination due to habitus and patient
positioning. No central pulmonary embolism or definite aortic
dissection.
3. Left lobe consolidations suggestive of aspiration. Right
large pleural effusion and associated atelectasis.
4. Small amount of free fluid around the gallbladder, liver, and
in the pancreas, likely from fluid overload.
5. 4.7 cm exophytic round lesion adjacent to the left aspect of
the lower uterine segment ? cervical fibroid. Followup
imaging/ultrasound recommended when the patient is more stable.
6. Gallstones.
7. Left adrenal indeterminate lesion, 2 cm. This can be further
evaluated with dedicated adrenal CT scan with washout study
8. Left kidney indeterminate lesion, 2.2 cm, which can also be
evaluated at time of adrenal CT.
.
TTE ([**2167-1-22**])
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF
70%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There are three aortic
valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Tricuspid regurgitation is present but cannot be
quantified. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Chest ([**2167-2-6**])
Comparison with [**2-5**] at 14:12 hours. The tracheostomy tube
terminates 6 cm above the carina. Again there is a suggestion of
lucency within the right paratracheal region, which may
represent a small amount of air within the mediastinum. The
mediastinum remains widened. There is no pneumothorax. The left
PICC line projects over the junction of the brachiocephalic
veins. There is a stable small right pleural effusion, and mild
pulmonary edema. The cardiac contour is stable. Clinical
correlation regarding the widened mediastinum is recommended,
and a CT could be performed if clinically indicated.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Cardiopulmonary arrest - EMS notes indicated that the patient
was found with agonal breathing, but initially in sinus
bradycardia at a rate of @ 34 with a palpable pulse. An oral
airway was placed and she was ventilated. However, she
subsequently lost her pulse, and CPR was initiated. The etiology
of her cardiopulmonary arrest was unclear. [**Name2 (NI) 227**] her infiltrate
by chest X-ray, as well as the reports by EMS, a primary
respiratory event is likely. A primary cardiac event was felt
unlikely. There was no evidence of ischemia by cardiac
biomarkers. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolus by CT
angiography. Blood glucose was 211 in field. There was no
evidence of adrenal insufficiency by cosyntropin stimulation
testing. The patient had no further episodes of arrest during
the admission.
.
# Respiratory failure - Patient was intubated during her
cardiopulmonary arrest. She received a of 7 day course of
vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl for a left upper lobe
infiltrate on chest X-ray. After a prolonged intubation, she
remained difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation. Her
rapid shallow breathing indexes remained between 250-300.
Although she was not previously known to have lung disease, she
had evidence of chronic CO2 retention. She had previously
received radiation to the chest for lympthoma. A bronchoscopoy
during this admission demonstrated tracheomalacia. Decision was
made to pursue tracheostomy. This was initially planned by the
interventional pulmonary service, but was ultimately performed
by surgery on [**2167-2-6**] due to her body habitus. She was discharged
to an acute care facility for weaning from mecha
