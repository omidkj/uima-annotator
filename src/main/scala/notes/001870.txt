History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 78131**] is a 46 [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1459**]
Hospital on [**2108-12-20**] with suspected bacterial meningitis. She
initially presented to [**Hospital3 1443**] two mornings ago with
severe HA & N/V of ~12 hours duration. Head CT was negative, she
denied F/C, and she was discharged on medications for headache.
Twelve hours after discharge to home, she was found altered and
agitated at home by her mother, who brought her to [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) 1459**]. There she had a temp of 102, WBC 27, negative head CT
and CSF c/w bacterial meningitis (Tueb 1 3400 WBC; Tube 4 WBC
7000, 90% poly, gm stain mod WBC, few GPC). She was intubated
for airway protection with etomodate & succinate and was given
vanco 500 mg & chloramphenicol 1 g (given broad allergy mix). A
right IJ was placed.

Upon arrival to the ED here, she had T 100.6, BP 136/81, HR 127,
AC 100%. She was sedated on fentanyl and midazolam. She was
given decadron 10 mg IV as well as vanco 500 mg (for a total of
1 g), ampicillin, ceftriaxone and acyclovir. (The family
explained that her allergy to the [**Name (NI) 621**] was just rash and she
could be challenged on [**Last Name (LF) 621**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ID.) She was given ~5L between
our ED and OSH.

Past Medical History:
Brain aneurysm s/p coiling (vs. surgery?) at [**Hospital1 112**], 1st surgery
[**2103-4-30**] followed by a 2nd surgery [**2103-9-3**].

IMAGING:
CXR [**2108-12-20**]: Probable left lower lobe pneumonia. Pulmonary edema
cleared

CTA [**2108-12-23**]: 1)No pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection or
aneurysm. 2)Small bilateral pleural effusions with overlying
right lower lobe
atelectasis.

TTE [**2108-12-24**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Doppler
parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic
function. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. No valvular
pathology or pathologic flow identified.

CT Abdoman and pelvis [**2108-12-25**]: 1. No evidence of pelvic abscess
or [**Last Name (un) **]. Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. 2. 2.8 cm
simple left ovarian cyst. 3. Interval improvement in bibasilar
consolidation with residual basilar airspace opacities
concerning for infection. Stable small bilateral pleural
effusions.

CXR [**2108-12-26**]: 1. Patchy bilateral opacites, greater on the left,
compatible with pneumonia and/or edema. Slight interval
improvement of the left opacifications. 2. Endotracheal tube
terminating 9 cm above the level of the carina.

CT head/CTA head [**2108-12-27**]:
IMPRESSION: 1. CT head shows clipping for MCA and BA aneurysms.
No hemorrhage or hydrocephalus. Mild right mastoid fluid seen.
2. CTA head shows no aneurysms or occlusion.
3. CTV shows no sinus thrombosis.

DISCHARGE LABS:



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 78131**] is a 46 yoF who presented with 24-26 hours of HA,
N/V and found to have evidence of bacterial menigitis on OSH w/u
of agitation and altered MS.
.
#. ALTERED MS/Group B Strep Meningitis: Patient was found to
have pansensitive Group B Strep meningitis from OSH CSF and
urine cultures. She was treated initially with broad spectrum
antibiotics, but was switched to Penicillin G, as per ID. No
primary source of infection was found for the Group B Strep and
all cultures drawn at [**Hospital1 18**] since [**12-21**] have been negative. CT
abdomen/pelvis was negative for abscess.
.
The patient did have persistently elevated WBC's during her
admission, despite IV antibiotics. As the patient had a history
of cerebral aneurysms that were coiled approximately 5 years ago
(titanium clips placed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3065**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital1 112**] Office#:
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 111608**], pager [**Numeric Identifier 44773**]), there was concern that these could
have become secondarily infected leading to persistent
infection. CTA/CTV of the head and orbits was performed as well
as MRI head and all were negative for abscess or dural venous
sinus thrombosis. ECHO was similarly negative for vegetations.
MRI did demonstrate some right-sided mastoid fluid, a known
sequelae of the patient's neurosurgery. ENT was consulted, but
they thought that since patient demonstrated clinical
improvement, no intervention was warranted. The patient's WBC
began trending down and she was discharged with a WBC of 13. She
has completed 12 days of antibiotics and has a plan for q4H IV
Penicillin G therapy for the next 3 weeks. Her mental status at
the time of discharge was at her baseline. She will be followed
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7443**] in ID with follow-up scheduled for early [**Month (only) 404**].
.
#. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: The patient was initially placed on a
ventilator for "airway protection" with altered MS. It was
difficult to wean her for several days, as the patient was
dysynchronous and required sedation. She had a CTA chest and was
found to have b/l pleu
