Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intrathecal methotrexate therapy x2 via lumbar puncture


History of Present Illness:
HPI:  69 yo man with NHL with CNS involvement (lymphomatous
meningitis) s/p intrathecal MTX, Rituxan, Velcade and steroids.
Patient presented to ER on [**2168-7-15**] with progressive weakness of
both arms and legs for the last 2-3 weeks. He reports that his
weakness (b/l arms and legs, R>L) has been ongoing over the past
few months worsening over the past few weeks, mainly over the
past 5 days.  He walks with a cane at baseline, but has noted
that walking up stairs with his left leg leading has become
increasingly more difficult due to his weakness.  He denies
symptoms of bowel/bladder incontinence.
.
On arrival to ED was found to be tachycardic and hypotensive to
systolic near 70s. EKG c/w SVT. He was given adenosine 6 mg then
12, had a 30 sec break, but reverted to SVT.  After 1 g
procainamide load, he converted to NSR.
.
Additionally in the ED, CTA was performed which did not show
evidence of PE (h/o DVT on coumadin; INR therapeutic) but with
new LUL infiltrate.  He was seen by Neuro in the ED; weakness
thought secondary to patient's underlying disease vs. use of
velcade. He underwent MRI of entire spine which has not yest
been read.
.
He was transferred to the  [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring. During his 24 h
stay patient has remained in NSR. He was started on levofloxacin
for possible PNA given LUL consolidation on imaging although not
c/o symptoms of pneumonia.
.
ROS: Pt denies fever or chills. No night sweats or recent weight
loss or gain. No headache, rhinorrhea or cough,or congestion.
Denied cough, shortness of breath (except transiently in the
setting of SVT). Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations.
Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal
pain. No melena or BRBPR. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or
myalgias. No rash.

Past Medical History:
NHL (see below) complicated by lymphomatous meningitis
RLE weakness secondary to plexopathy
Bilateral upper extremity weakness
RLE DVT
Hives intermittently over last couple years
Raynaud's phenomena
LUL lesion in [**2129**] s/p INH x1yr
S/p appendectomy
.
Onc Hx: Initially presented with palpable lymph node in the
groin in [**2167-3-4**]. Biopsy revealed diffuse large cell
lymphoma. S/p R-CHOP x 6 cycles, completed in [**2167-7-2**]. Patient
was well until [**Month (only) **]-[**2167-11-1**] when he developed right
lower extremity paralysis. LP at that time was negative for
malignant cells but repeat LP on [**2168-2-17**] revealed malignant
cells with MRI showing increased uptake in the sacral plexus.
The patient was evaluated by neurology and thought to have a
right lumbosacral plexopathy. The patient underwent IVIg therapy
without relief. Around mid [**2168-2-1**] the patient began
radiation therapy x9-12 treatments to the sacrum with
improvement in pain complaints. He was also initiated on
decadron. Since [**2168-3-4**] the patient receives intrathecal
methotrexate every 1-2 weeks. He has regained some use of his
right lower extremity.


Social History:
He is retired and worked as a marine engineer. He is married and
never smoked. he has approximately 3 alcholic beverages a night.
He has never used any illegal drugs.


Family History:
His mother died at 93 of old age. His father died at 75 of heart
failure. His sister is 65 and has diabetes and hypertension. He
has two healthy daughters.

anterior right lower extremity to distal shin.

Pertinent Results:
B-glucan= >500

[**2168-7-16**] CXR: Comparison is made with prior examination performed
one day ago. There is persistent ill-defined airspace disease
involving left upper lobe likely related to pneumonia.  There is
increasing density at the right base with blunting of the right
costophrenic angle.  Findings are suggestive of right basilar
atelectasis and small right pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable.  Central venous catheter is present with
tip in the right atrium.
.
[**2168-7-15**] MRI spine:  Compared to the previous study of [**2168-4-2**],
there are now new focal signal abnormalities identified from L1
to L5 level.  The previously noted subtle lesions in some of
these vertebral bodies have increased in size.  Findings are
indicative of lymphoma deposits or metastatic disease.  There is
increased signal seen on T1- and T2-weighted images in the
remaining portions of the lumbar vertebral bodies and sacrum
indicative of fatty marrow changes from radiation.  Focal signal
abnormality in the upper sacrum is also identified on the right
side, indicative of metastasis or bony involvement by lymphoma.
This has also increased since the previous study.  There is no
epidural mass seen or thecal sac compression identified.
IMPRESSION:  New bony metastatic lesions involving the lumbar
vertebral body with increase in size of previously noted lesion.
 No evidence of pathologic fracture or intraspinal mass.
.
[**2168-7-15**] CTA chest:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2.  Patchy ground-glass opacity within the left upper lobe,
which is new since [**2168-4-1**] and likely represent an infectious
process.
3.  Stable 12 mm prevascular lymph node within the mediastinum.
4.  Multiple low density lesions within the liver, which given
history of lymphoma may represent metastates, or given pulmonary
findings could represent infection.

[**2168-7-21**]:MRI spine, interval increase in size and # of enhancing
metastatic foci in LS spine, no involvment of exiting nerve
roots or thecal sac.
[**2168-7-21**] MRI brachial plexus: Normal examination of the right and
left brachial plexus, without abnormal
enhancement. Mild degenerative changes of the cervical spine and
focus of signal abnormality in the T6 vertebral body.
Parenchymal abnormalities of the left lung apex.
