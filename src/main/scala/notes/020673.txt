Admission Date: [**2138-11-17**]        Discharge Date: [**2138-11-26**]

Date of Birth:  [**2075-10-14**]        Sex:  M

Service:  ENT


HOSPITAL COURSE CONTINUED:  The patient was weaned off of
dextran on [**11-23**].  JP number 2 was taken out on [**11-24**], JP
number 3 on [**11-25**].

1. NEURO:  He was initially on Ativan for DT prophylaxis at 1
   mg IV q 6 h, which was weaned at the time of discharge.
   It is currently 0.25 mg q 8 h for 1 day.  After [**11-26**], he
   can be placed on Ativan 0.25 mg q 8 h prn for agitation.
   In addition, he is getting oxycodone through his G-tube,
   and Tylenol for pain control.

1. CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was on Lopressor during his
   hospital stay IV.  When he was able to take G-tube
   medications, he was restarted on his
   triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide.  The dose is 37.5/25 mg 1
   tablet once daily.  In addition, he has Lopressor prn for
   hypertension/tachycardia.

1. RESPIRATORY:  The patient's tracheostomy tube was changed
   again on [**11-26**] to a number 4 cuffless Shiley
   nonfenestrated tube.  The patient tolerated this well.  It
   is sutured in place.  No trach tie should be placed around
   the neck to avoid kinking the flap, or compromising the
   blood supply to the neck in any way.  He was started on
   trach capping trials the day of his discharge.  He may
   have the trach capped during the day, but should be
   uncapped at night and for transfer initially.  As he is
   able to tolerate this better and better, he may be capped
   overnight, with the eventual plan for a decannulation at
   Dr.[**Name (NI) 20390**] discretion.  He should continue to
   receive trach care teaching, about how to care for his
   tracheostomy tube when he returns to his home.  He has a
   Passy-Muir valve that he can use in place of the trach cap
   if he needs additional air and would like to speak.
   Alternatively, placing the cap over the trach tube (the
   red inner cannula) will enable him to speak without the
   Passy-Muir valve.

1. GI:  The patient was on ProMod tube feeds at 50 ml/h for
   most his stay.  This was changed to 120 ml/h for 12 h at
   night cycled so that he could eat during the day.  He
   tolerated this rate well and has moved his bowels.  He is
   on multivitamins.  He started with small sips on postop
   day 9 and has advanced to mechanical soft diet as
   tolerated.

1. GU:  The patient's Foley catheter was removed while in the
   ICU.  He was voiding normally and has had no issues.

1. HEME:  His last hematocrit was 28.9, which is stable for
   him.  His white count has been slightly low at 3-4
   throughout his hospital admission.

1. INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  He was on Unasyn up until postop day
   9.  After all of his drains were removed, the Unasyn was
   stopped.  He does not require any antibiotics for
   discharge.  He had a small amount of ecchymosis on the
   superior skin flap that was resolving.  It appeared as a
   red flush on his skin, but was nonblanching, and was not
   felt to be infectious.

1. DISCHARGE PLAN:  The patient is to follow-up with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] in the [**Hospital **] Clinic in 1 week.  The
   patient reports he has an appointment previously made for
