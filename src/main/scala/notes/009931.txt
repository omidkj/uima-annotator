Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2234**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
46 y/o Ethiopian male hx T1DM, HIV, ESRD (secondary to
nephrolithiasis, htn and T1DM) presented to the ED complaining
of shortness of breath and chest pain. He claims that the chest
pain is the same all the time, nonpleuritic, nonpositional,
nonradiating, but that his shortness of breath worsens when he
lays flat. He notes that the last time he felt this kind of
pain, he was found to have a large pleural effusion. The bedside
ultrasound was brought over and did not show any evidence of an
effusion, and because he is HD dependent, he was sent for a CTA,
which showed an acute PE as well as evidence of chronic PE's.
His pressures were in the 200's systolic, and he was started on
a nitroglycerin gtt, with little benefit. Otherwise, he was
afebrile and with mild respiratory distress to the low 20's.
He was seen by renal in the ED (he is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**] as
an outpatient) who felt that his hypertension was likely
secondary to him missing his AM meds, as he had just had HD the
day prior to admission.
He also had a head CT, prior to initiating heparin gtt to rule
out head bleed, and it could not rule out SAH given the dye load
from the CTA. The ED therefore did not start anticoagulation and
sent the patient to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management of his
hypertension, renal failure and PE's.

Imaging:
[**6-11**]: CXR - IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
[**6-11**]: CTA IMPRESSION: 1. Segmental and subsegmental right lower
lobe acute pulmonary embolism. 2. Stable findings of chronic
right lower lobe PE. 3. Diffuse and more focal ground-glass
opacities, which could represent an infectious process such as
viral or atypical pneumonia. Pneumocystis pneumonia could also
have this appearance in the proper clinical setting. Asymmetric
pulmonary edema is a less likely consideration.
.
[**6-11**]: Head CT: IMPRESSION: 1. No definite acute intracranial
hemorrhage; however, intravascular contrast remains on board
from the recent CTA PE study, and thus subarachnoid and subtle
extra-axial hemorrhage cannot be excluded on this CT. 2.
Prominent ventriculomegaly, not significantly changed from
[**2108-7-9**]. 3. Low-lying cerebellar tonsils consistent with Chiari
I malformation.
.
[**6-12**]: Head CT:
FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect,
shift of midline structures, or infarction.  The ventricles
remain prominently enlarged, unchanged from recent examination.
There is stable appearance to low lying cerebellar tonsils as
noted on prior exams. Soft tissues and osseous structures are
unremarkable.  Perinasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well
aerated.
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of hemorrhage.
2. Unchanged Chiari I malformation and prominent
ventriculomegaly
.

[**6-13**] Echo: Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
11-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function  is normal (LVEF 60%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left  ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal  defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets aremildly  thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is severe mitral annular
calcification. At least mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
present. [Due to  acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly  UNDERestimated.] There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There  is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2108-7-10**], the [**Last Name (un) 22837**] annular calcification is now
severe, and the mitral  regurgitation is increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
46 year old Ethiopian man with a history of Type I diabetes
mellitus, CKD stage V on hemodialysis, malignant hypertension,
HIV on HAART who presented with concomitant severe nausea,
vomiting, chest pain and subsequent shortness of breath.  The
following issues were addressed on this admission:
.
1. Respiratory distress:  Initiating event thought to be nausea
and vomiting secondary to gastroparesis.  Patient unable to take
anti-hypertensives and combined with sympathetic tone from
nausea, vomiting, patient then likely devloped hypertension with
systolics to >200's (>250 in emergency room).  Chest pain
secondary to vomiting or possibly ischemia with severe
hypertension.   Shortness of breath appears to have developed
secondary to pulmonary edema from severe hypertension.  Low
oxygen requirements even in this setting.  Patient underwent CTA
of chest and found to have acute segmental and subsegmental PE's
as well as chronic PE's, ultimately not thought to have been
responsible for presentation.  Patient was placed on
nitroglycerin drip in ER and in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for short time.  Once
nausea controlled, home blood pressure regimen re-initiated with
good control. Patient dialyzed morning after admission for
pulmonary edema.   With control of nausea, blood pressure and
dialysis, resp distress resolved.  No further episodes
throughout admission.  Patient transferred to the floor on HD#2,
[**6-12**].  See PE below.  Cardiac enzymes cycled and remained flat,
no concerning ECG changes.
.
2)Pulmonary Emboli: Patient found to have acute segmental and
subsegmental PE in RLL and chronic PE.  Initially unable to rule
out head bleed (CT head images affected by contrast dye from
CTA) and therefore heparin therapy withheld. Patient transferred
to the floor and had repeat head CT [**6-12**] without evidence of head
bleed. Heparin gtt and coumadin 7.5 mg initiated [**6-12**].  Coumadin
7.5 mg on [**6-13**], INR then 2.3 on 7/6AM.  5mg [**6-14**] pm and then INR
4.1 on [**6-15**].  Coumadin held [**6-15**] and INR 3.8  on [**6-16**].  Given INR>2
x 48 hours on heparin, heparin discontinued on [**6-16**] and patient
