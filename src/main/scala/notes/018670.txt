History of Present Illness:
This is a 83 year-old male with MMP including afib on coumadin,
CAD, cardiomyopathy s/p ICD/pacer, T2DM, HTN, hyperlipidemia,

He was initially treated with azithromycin and ceftriaxone. He
worsened clinically and continued to have fevers and he was
switched to vancomycin and zosyn. He was discharged to rehab to
complete his course of ABx. Hospital course was c/b

Portable CXR, [**2191-2-21**]: The study is limited secondary to
profoundly diminished lung volumes and patient positioning.
Despite these limitations, there is significant opacification
and a patchy distribution throughout the aerated right lung. The
findings are most compatible with a pneumonia likely involving
the right lower lobe. There is a more hazy linear opacity at the
left lung base, likely atelectasis. The remaining left lung is
clear. A dual-lead pacemaker is stable in course and position.
There is atherosclerotic disease of the aorta again identified.
The cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess, but grossly
stable. Degenerative changes are noted throughout the thoracic
spine.
  IMPRESSION: Patchy opacities throughout the right lung,
presumably the right lower lobe, most compatible with pneumonia.
If clinically feasible, consider PA and lateral views to
establish a baseline early in treatment.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST [**2191-2-22**]:
COMPARISON: CT of the chest obtained on [**2191-2-7**] in
[**Location (un) 620**] and chest radiograph obtained on [**2191-2-21**].

TECHNIQUE: Unenhanced MDCT of the chest was obtained from
thoracic inlet to upper abdomen with subsequent 1.25- and 5-mm
collimation axial images reviewed in conjunction with coronal
and sagittal reformats.

FINDINGS:
Compared to the prior chest CT obtained two weeks ago, there is
interval
worsening of the involvement of the right upper lobe and right
middle lobe
extensive areas of consolidation containing air bronchogram with
some slight interval improvement of the right lower lobe
consolidations. There is also increase in size of the left lower
lobe consolidations with interval development of bilateral small
pleural effusions.
  Several mediastinal lymph nodes are enlarged including right
paraesophageal lymph node, 2:32, measuring 13 mm; right lower
paratracheal lymph node measuring 14 mm as well as several
scattered mediastinal lymph nodes, not pathologically enlarged.
Compared to the prior study, this lymph nodes have increased in
size in the interval, most likely being reactive.
  There is no pericardial effusion. The heart size is increased.
The position of the pacemaker lead terminating in the right
ventricle is unchanged.
  The imaged portion of the upper abdomen is unremarkable except
for calcified splenic artery.
  There are no bone lesions worrisome for malignancy. Several
healed anterior fractures of the lower left rib are noted,
unchanged.
  IMPRESSION:
  1. Interval worsening of the multifocal pneumonia, in
particular in the right upper and left lower lobes.
  2. Small bilateral pleural effusion.
  3. Interval additional increase in mediastinal
lymphadenopathy, most likely reactive, but should be evaluated
with subsequent following study after injection of IV contrast.
  4. Status post cholecystectomy.

ECHO [**2191-2-23**]:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is probably moderately
depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %) with inferior and infero-lateral
akinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect. There is
abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CT Chest [**2191-2-28**]:FINDINGS:

Extensive parenchymal abnormality in the contracted right lung,
characterized
by widespread ground-glass opacification and multiple areas of
peribronchial
infiltration and septal thickening predominantly in the lower
lung is very
little changed since [**2-22**]. In the anterior segment of the
right upper
lobe there is less peribronchial infiltration. More focal
regions of
