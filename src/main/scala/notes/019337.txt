Reason: S/P PICC LINE WITH SWELLING

INDICATION: 51-year-old female with left arm swelling, rule out
DVT.

COMPARISON: No previous venous studies for comparison.

FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the left jugular,
subclavian, axillary, and brachial veins were performed. There
is normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the left upper extremity.

Fever
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
?Pulmonary Infiltrates, Consolidation
CHEST, SINGLE AP FILM

History of fever and tracheostomy.

Tracheostomy tube is 3 cm above carina. Heart size is normal.
Compared with the previous study of [**2134-6-20**], there has
been partial resolution of the left basilar atelectasis with
some persistent subsegmental atelectasis in this location. No
new lung lesions. G- tube overlies left upper quadrant.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
51 year old woman with traumatic brain injury
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
**DWI** please evaluate for diffuse axonal injury
MR SCAN OF THE BRAIN

HISTORY: Evaluate for diffuse axonal injury.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was
obtained.

COMPARISON STUDY: Prior CT scans from [**6-6**].

FINDINGS: The FLAIR images show multiple foci of elevated
signal, with gradient-echo scans showing many of these lesions
having areas of susceptibility seen within the frontal lobes,
linear in distribution on the left side within the left centrum
semiovale, corpus callosal body, left hippocampus, posterior
aspect of the left insular cortex, and left occipital
periventricular white matter. A linear area of elevated signal
is also seen within the posterior limb of the right internal
capsule and right lentiform nucleus as well. These multiple
lesions are consistent with the diagnosis of diffuse axonal
injury, with a hemorrhagic component. The linear distribution of
the left frontal centrum semiovale lesions also raises the
possibility of coexistent hypoxic episode in a so-called
"watershed" distribution that may have occurred at the time of
the accident. Many of these lesions are hyperintense on
diffusion- weighted scans as well.

There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline
structures.

The surrounding osseous and extracranial soft tissues are
notable for moderate right-sided ethmoid and sphenoid sinus
mucosal thickening, which may relate to the patient's intubated
status. A small amount of secretions are also seen within the
posterior nasopharyngeal region.

CONCLUSION: Findings suggestive of diffuse axonal injury with a
hemorrhagic component. Findings were discussed with Chip
[**Doctor Last Name 3903**], physician's assistant, on [**6-10**] at 10:30 a.m.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval for PNA please

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
51 year old woman with diffuse axonal injury, vent dependent w
increasing secretions
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for PNA please
INDICATION: Ventilator-dependent with increasing secretions.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2134-7-11**], the
tracheostomy tube remains in place and the right lung is clear.
There is an area of increased opacification in the left lower
lung zone. However, this does not silhouette the heart border or
the hemidiaphragm or obscure the traversing vessels and may well
be an artifact.

If there is clinical suspicion of developing pneumonia, a repeat
film would be suggested.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma service. Neurosurgery was
consulted because of her brain injuries which were nonoperative;
an ICP bolt was placed and she was transferred to the Trauma
ICU. She was loaded with Dilantin and remained on this for
approximately 2 weeks. Serial head CT scans were followed and
were stable. The ICP bolt was eventually removed.

Because she was difficult to wean from the ventilator she
underwent a tracheostomy. During this procedure a percutaneous
feeding tube was placed in order to provide nutritional support.
Tube feedings were initiated and she is tolerating this. The
decision was also made to place an IVC filter given that she
would remain immobile and was at risk for thromboembolic events.


A family/team meeting took place early on to discuss her
prognosis and the likelihood of a poor recovery of cognitive
function. The decision was made by the family to pursue care and
treatment.

She was eventually transferred to the regular nursing unit which
is where she has remained. Physical and Occupational therapy has
worked with her; there have been no significant gains regarding
functional abilities. She does however op
