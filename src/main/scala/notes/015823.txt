Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 87 y.o. F with angioectasias in the stomach
body and antrum on endoscopy in [**4-/2118**], diverticulosis but no
polyps [**1-/2118**], sinus bradycardia s/p pacemaker, diastolic heart
failure (EF 70% in echo [**12-10**]), who presented with weakness and
GI Bleeding.

In the ED, initial VS: T 99.2 HR 72 BP 145/64 RR 17 97% RA. BPs
ranged 105-134/47-60. HR ranged 60-63. Labs drawn and notable
for Hct drop of 10 (34 to 24). EKG showed a-paced 60 bpm, LAD,
nl intervals, no acute Q waves, no TWI, no ST changes.  CXR
showed COPD and slightly improved underlying pulmonary edema.
She was given 1 L NS, Pantoprazole 40 IV x 1, GI was consulted.
NG lavage performed and negative. Per report from ED, guiaic
positive black stools.
.

.
# GI Bleeding: Pt presented with bright red blood per rectum per
report and was found to have guiaic + black stools on multiple
exams.  She was transfered to the ICU where she was transfused
two units of pRBCs and her Hct subsequently returned to 32.6.
Her beta blocker was held to not mask tachycardia.  Pt had 2
large bore IVs placed and was started on IV PPI.  She also
received O2 by nc for saturations in the 92% although the
patient denied SOB. The next day she was stared on a clear diet.
She continued to do well and was transfered to the medicine
floor.  She remained hemodynamically stable with HR in 60s
(paced) and BP 120-140s. Hct baseline 30-32.  Her aspirin
continued to be held and she was placed on telemetry without any
events.   GI was consulted and performed an EGD to rule out
upper GI as the cause of bleed.  The upper EGD was negative for
a source of bleeding so it was assumed that the bleed was
diverticular as diverticula were observed on recent colonoscopy
in [**Month (only) 958**].  GI did not feel there was a need to do a colonoscopy
at this time because there is nothing they could do for a
diverticular bleed, and the probability that something else was
causing the bleeding (AKA colon cancer) was very low considering
the recent negative colonoscopy.  Serial Hct checks were
preformed and the patient remained stable without evidence of
continued bleeding.  She was started on a clear diet and this
was advanced to regular.  She tolerated it well.  She was made a
follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**9-5**].
.
# oxygen requirement:
the pt was found to have an O2 saturation of 92% in ICU was
started on O2 by nc.  This may have been from anema due to acute
blood loss.  The pt's baseline is 92% -96% on RA.  Her oxygen
was weaned and she did well without it, not complaining of any
shortness of breath.

# Hypertension:
The patient's atenolol was initially held so as not to mask
tachycardia from bleeding.  When her hematocrit remained stable
and she showed no signs of bleeding, her home medications were
restarted including her atenolol.
.
# CHF, diastolic:
The patient's furosemide and moexipril were also initially held,
but after she stabilized and showed no evidence of bleeding,
they were restarted.
.
# Hypothyroidism: stable.  The patient's home dose of  50 mcg
levothyroxine was continued.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: stable. The patient's home dose of pravastatin
was continued.
.
# Mood: Stable.  The patient's home dose of seroquel was
continued.
