Pathology - Lymph node excisional biopsy [**2159-7-13**]: REACTIVE
LYMPHOID TISSUE WITH NECROTIZING GRANULOMAS, SEE NOTE. Tissue
sections show fragments of a lymph node and soft tissues with
necrotizing granulomas (two), which contain neutrophils and
eosinophils. Special stains for fungal, bacterial, and
mycobacteria organisms (GMS, PAS, [**Doctor Last Name 6311**], AFB) are negative
with adequate controls. There is no morphologic or
immunophenotypic evidence of lymphoma. Necrotizing granulomas
containing neutrophils are suggestive of an infectious process
and are most typical of Bartonella (Cat scratch disease),
Tularemia, Yersinia, and lymphogranuloma venereum.  Fungal and
mycobacterial infections remain formal possibilities and are far
more common that the ones above.
.
CXR [**2159-8-3**]:  There is no focal consolidation or superimposed
edema. Again noted is marked bilateral hilar and
aorticopulmonary window lymphadenopathy. This is stable across
multiple studies and has been diagnosed by biopsy. The
mediastinum is otherwise stable. No effusion or pneumothorax is
noted. The osseous structures again demonstrate markedly
atrophic bilateral first ribs. IMPRESSION: Stable mediastinal
lymphadenopathy. No acute pulmonary process.
.
CT head [**2159-8-3**]: no hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 year-olf female with history of cocaine abuse, pulmonary
hypertension, mediastinal adenopathy, recent extensive admit to
medicine for the above issues, initially admitted with lower
extremity pain and eventual progressive weakness. Her hospital
course will be briefly reviewed by problems.

1) [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 7816**] [**Location (un) **].  Progressive neurologic symptoms (worsening
weakness in particular) led to LP on [**2159-8-6**]. This revealed [**8-14**]
WBCs and very high protein at 177. NIFs and vital capacities
were monitored and noted to be initially -20 and <1 liter
respectively. She was again transferred to the MICU on [**2159-8-6**].
NIFs and VCs were closely monitored and improved slightly during
her course.  Despite continued poor values, clinical respiratory
status remained stable and she never required intubation. She
received IVIG x 5 daily doses. Strength improved slightly. A
slow and protracted recovery is expected.

2) Hypotension: She had transient hypotension while on the
floor, which resolved with IV bolus prior to going to MICU.
Occured in setting of getting IV ativan earlier in the morning
and few days of poor PO intake. Encouraged PO intake. For her
infection/sepsis workup, MRI spine without evidence of epidural
abscess. Positive for C.diff; flagyl started. ID consulted
regarding Exophilia fungus in past lymph node biopsy (from FNA
bronch); though to be a contaminant.

3) Hyponatremia: Sodium nadir 121. Renal was consulted, and the
possibility of pseudohyponatremia [**2-3**] IVIG versus SIADH was
raised. Urine lytes suggestive of SIADH, and fluid restriction
1000 mL instituted, liberal salt intake. On discharge, sodium
was 129.

4) Coagulopathy: She developed a mild coagulopathy with elevated
INR, mild thrombocytopenia to 122K. Hematology was consulted,
picture overall most consistent with low-grade DIC, possibly in
the setting of C. diff. Improved with antimicrobial therapy,
vitamin K.

5) Mediastinal adenopathy: Mediastinoscopy during last admit.
During this hospital stay, she continued to have palpable
supraclav and cervical adenopathy (though seems improved per
previous notes). Necrotizing granulomas identified on prior
biopsy. Etiology remains elusive, to follow-up with pulmonary as
an out-patient with F/U CT scan chest.

6) Acute renal failure: Peak creatinine 2.4, improved with
hydration, nephrotoxic agents held.

7) Chronic back pain: MRI spine negative for abscess (though
limited study). Pain control achieved with oxycontin and
oxycodone.
