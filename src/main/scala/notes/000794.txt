History of Present Illness:
50 yo male with h/o COPD, CAD s/p
STEMI, CHF, OSA, DM2 who presented with 2-3 days of increasing
dyspnea, wheezing and lower extremity edema; family also reports
cough, no fevers. Pt describes LE edema as acute onset on
[**2193-8-9**], associated with intense pruritis of the soles/ankles of
both feet developing into swelling. After significant
encouragement from family/friends, presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ER on
[**2193-8-14**] and was found to be hypercarbic and hypoxic. Pt became
somnolent and was intubated in the ED for hypercarbic
respiratory
failure and admitted to the MICU. VS in the ED were 98.8,
136/85,
125, 26, 75% 2L NC, ABG 7.22/96/59 --> 7.11/134/77. Pt was also
given solumedrol, nebs, levofloxacin, magnesium in ED for COPD
exacerbation/?PNA; heparin gtt and CTA ordered for ?PE. CTA neg
for PE, CT head neg for bleed.
.
ROS was otherwise negative for chest pain or tightness,
palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or
abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No
dysuria. No syncope, near-syncope.
.
MICU course: Pt remained on NIPPV [**11-11**] with FiO2 50% and started
on Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin for ?PNA, lasix for fluid overload,
nebulizers for COPD exacerbation. Solumedrol was changed to
prednisone taper on [**2193-8-19**] starting at 30mg/day. Pt also had
BAL

sputum
cx NGTD. Pt was extubated w/o issues the morning of [**8-18**] (day 5
of mechanical ventilation) and has remained stable since.

CTA CHEST ([**8-14**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of large pulmonary embolus. Evaluation of distal
branches are limited.
2. Diffuse subcentimeter ground-glass nodules and more
solid-appearing 6-mm nodule in the right lower lobe. Followup CT
within 6 months is recommended.
3. Diffuse mediastinal and hilar adenopathy as described above.

ECHO ([**8-16**]) - IMPRESSION: No large amounts of right-to-left
shunting seen, although images are suboptimal. Normal global
biventricular function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-1-9**],
current images are technically suboptimal, so precise comparison
is difficult. No
ASD/PFO/VSD detected on bubble study.

CXR: The ET tube tip is 8 cm above the carina. NG tube tip is in
the stomach. There is no change in the left basal opacity that
might represent a developing aspiration pneumonia versus
infectious process in combination with atelectasis. Upper lungs
are clear and there is no appreciable right pleural effusion.
Small amount of left pleural fluid cannot be excluded.

BAL Cx: NGTD. Neg legionella, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3019**], CMV
Blood Cx: Neg
Sputum Cx: Neg


Brief Hospital Course:
50 yo male with h/o COPD, CAD s/p STEMI, CHF, OSA, DM2 who
presented with 2-3 days of increasing dyspnea and was intubated
emergently in ED for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Pt has
since been extubated and almost back to baseline pulmonary
function. Etiology remains unclear.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:

# RESPIRATORY FAILURE. Combined hypercarbic and hypoxic
respiratory failure. Etiology unclear. Chronically elevated
hematocrit suggestive of some level of chronic hypoxia. Likely a
combination of COPD, OSA. No obvious infection on CXR to suggest
PNA. Could also have been in setting of volume overload but did
not
appear wet on physical exam.
- Pt was given a seven day course of Ceftriaxone and five day
course of Azithromycin which he finished prior to discharge.
- Pt was diuresed with Lasix 40mg daily while in MICU and on the
Medicine floors. Pt is to resume home dose of Lasix 20mg upon
discharge.
- Pt started on a Prednisone taper, 30mg X 3days, 20mg X3days,
10mg X3 days then stop
- Pt was continued on Albuterol inhaler, Albuterol/Ipratropium
nebs PRN.
.
# HYPERTENSION. Patient was normotensive during hospital stay.
He did have 2 episodes of self-limited, mild hypotension with
dizziness (SBP 100) with negative orthostatics. Home metoprolol
was continued in house. Lisinopril was held in MICU but
restarted on discharge.
.
# CAD. S/p inferior MI w/ BMS placement.
- Continued ASA 325mg, plavix 75mg, pravastatin, metoprolol in
house. Lisinopril was held in the MICU [**3-11**] CTA contrast dye.
Lisinopril was restarted on discharge home.
.
# DIABETES, Type II. Well controlled during hospital stay on
HISS.
- Pt on metformin as outpatient and was restarted on discharge.
