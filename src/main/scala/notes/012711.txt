respiratory status improved, RR decreased to 20s, SBP decreased
to 110s-120s and he calmed down and looked better. His CXR was
poor quality but called as moderate pulmonary edema and likely
effusions. He had not much UOP to initial 40 mg IV Lasix, so
given another 80mg IV Lasix with about 350 UOP before last
signout.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2157-9-3**]
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2157-9-15**]
There is a right-sided PICC ending about 2-3 cm past the
atriocaval
junction. Recommend pulling this back by 2-3 cm. The
cardiomediastinal
silhouette is enlarged. There is bibasilar atelectasis with
signs of
pulmonary edema.

Portable TEE (Complete) Done [**2157-9-13**]
No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic valve
abscess is seen. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There
is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetation or paravalvar abscess seen.
