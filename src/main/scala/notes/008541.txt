Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 57yo woman with laryngeal carcinoma s/p recent
trach and PEG, schizoaffective disorder, and COPD admitted with
hypoxia.

At the end of [**Month (only) 359**], she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after a
laryngeal mass was found on imaging for evaluation of
hoarseness.  Biopsy demonstrated invasive squamous cell
carcinoma.  She had dysphagia and failed her swallow evaluation,
so a PEG tube was placed.  She also had a trach placed in
anticipation of future radiation treatments; she is not
dependent on a ventilator.  She was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] on
[**11-20**] with the plan for chemoradiation with sedation prior to
her treatments.  Planning was initiated [**12-11**].

Today, the covering MD [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] was called because of an
increased oxygen requirement.  She had been on 6L trach mask
with sat's of 92-93%.  Overnight, her sat dropped to 85%, with
improvement to 92-94% when oxygen was increased to 9L by trach
mask.  A couple days prior, she had been noted to need frequent
suctioning for thick beige to yellow sputum.  CXR was reportedly
normal, but sputum Cx were sent and she was started on
vancomycin [**12-16**] and cefepime [**12-17**].  In light of her new hypoxia,
she was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of possible PE.

On ROS, she endorses a cough productive of sputum and a sore
throat that comes and goes.  Denies dyspnea.  No fevers or
chills.  No headache, sinus congestion, myalgias, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, or nausea.  +20 pound weight loss prior to last
hospitalization in [**Month (only) **].

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were:  99.2   123/72   100   24
89% on face mask.  She was able to communicate appropriately
with staff.  On exam, she was noted to have some white-colored
sputum.  Labs were significant for ABG: 7.47/42/76 with lactate
of 0.6.  Urine and blood cultures were sent, and he was started
on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.  CT  He received a total of 3L
of IVF.

Upon arrival to the ICU, she is breathing comfortably and
interactive with staff.

Past Medical History:

Social History:
Prior to her illness, she lived with her mother, who was
recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**].  Her sister [**Name (NI) **] is her HCP.  She
has been at [**Hospital1 **] since her discharge from [**Hospital1 **] on [**11-20**] with
the plan eventually to transition her to LTAC.  She states she
has not gotten out of bed at [**Hospital1 **].  She used to work as a
nurse's aide but stopped because of her psychiatric disease.

of her laryngeal cancer.  Denies alcohol.


Family History:

===================
STUDIES:
===================
EKG:  ST at 101 with normal axis and intervals.  Good R wave
progression.  TWI in III, aVF, V2, and V3 that are unchanged as
compared to baseline from [**2153-11-9**]
.

CXR [**12-19**] Question retrocardiac left lower lobe atelectasis
versus aspiration versus early pneumonia.
.
CTA Chest [**12-17**]:
1. No pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, or aneurysm.
2. Bibasilar consolidations seen dependently with scattered
impacted airways. This confluence of findings is most consistent
with aspiration.
3. Prominent subcarinal lymph node (12mm), appearing new from
[**Month (only) **]. While this is likely reactive given the short-term
development, metastasis remains a consideration. Ongoing
followup is recommended.
.
TTE [**12-19**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal septum and
apex. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild
regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (distal LAD distribution).



Brief Hospital Course:
57 yo woman with laryngeal cancer s/p trach but not ventilator
dependent admitted with hypoxia and hypotension.

# HYPOXEMIA:  Felt to be most likely COPD exacerbation versus
mucous plugging.  Aspiration pneumonitis was also considered, as
patient may have difficulty managing secretions.  She also had a
