Date of Birth:   [**2038-9-24**]       Sex:  F

Service:  MED-[**Hospital1 **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70 -year-old woman
with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea,
status post tracheostomy in [**2089**], who presented with
increasing somnolence and respiratory distress.  The patient
was in her usual state of health until one week prior to
admission when she began to suffer from abdominal pain when
eating, leading to diminished po intake.  She also had
suffered from right upper quadrant and right shoulder pain
not related to eating and not relieved by acetaminophen.
Additionally, she had been experiencing mild cough and
increasing shortness of breath.

The patient's mobility over this time has been further
limited by the elevated ambient temperatures because she only
has air conditioning in her bedroom.  Furthermore, the
patient had not used the aerosolizer with her supplemental
oxygen over this time period secondary to power concerns.  In
this situation, the patient's condition has slowly, but
progressively worsened over the week prior to admission until
the day of admission when the patient's sister noted that she
was falling asleep while talking to her on the phone in the
middle of the day.  The sister came to visit the patient and
noted her to be having difficulty breathing and increased
airway sounds around her tracheostomy.  For these reasons the
patient was presented to the [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) **] Emergency Department.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was found to have
concretions in her tracheostomy and this tracheostomy was
changed.  The patient was also begun on mechanical
ventilation for her initial arterial blood gas of 7.20 / 100
/ 63.  Her initial ventilator settings of AC tidal volume
600, rate of 12, FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 5.0, were decreased
over the course of the next two days to AC tidal volume of
500, rate of 8.0, FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 5.0.  Throughout
this time, her initial suction requirements decreased and the
secretions were of thinner quality.

Furthermore, the patient had been treated empirically with
levofloxacin for a concern of pneumonia, given the increased
secretions, the respiratory distress, and possible left lower
lobe consolidation on chest x-ray.  By [**2109-8-6**], which was
her third day in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient
was tolerating a tracheostomy mask trial and has been off
mechanical ventilation since that time.  Her last arterial
blood gas on tracheostomy mask with an FiO2 of 50% was 7.35 /
62 / 62.  This is thought to be at or near the patient's
baseline.

With regard to the other systems, she presented with a
history of chronic renal insufficiency and a creatinine of
1.8, but following moderate hydration has had a better than
normal value of 0.8.  She presented with decreased mental
status complicated by episodes of hypoglycemia, but she was
ruled out for intracranial process by head CT scan, found to
have normal electrolytes, and had her hypoglycemia corrected.
Her mental status subsequently quickly improved.  The
complaints of abdominal pain prior to admission resolved
during the first few days of her stay in the hospital.  Work
up was negative.

This patient also presented with a history of atrial
fibrillation / atrial flutter and a supratherapeutic INR.
This was corrected during her stay and she was continued on
low dose Coumadin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Morbid obesity.
2.  Obstructive sleep apnea, status post tracheostomy in
[**2089**], on supplemental oxygen of six liters at home.
3.  Polycythemia.
4.  Status post stroke in [**2089**] with residual right sided
deficits.
5.  Diabetes mellitus.
6.  Pulmonary hypertension.
7.  Cor pulmonale.
8.  Atrial fibrillation / atrial flutter, status post
ablation in [**2102**].
9.  Arthritis.

ADMITTING MEDICATIONS:  Potassium chloride, Lasix 80 mg po
bid, theophylline 300 mg po bid, Diltiazem CD 180 mg po q
day, Coumadin 2.0 mg to 5.0 mg po q day, Glucotrol 2.5 mg po
q day, and metaxalone 2.5 mg po twice per week.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with a companion /
caretaker and has a distant tobacco history, no alcohol or IV
drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient was afebrile
at 98.6 F, pulse of 68, blood pressure 106/57, respiratory
rate of 12, and she had an oxygen saturation of 95% on an
unknown oxygen level.  In general, she was awake and
responsive in bed, mechanically ventilated, and in no acute
distress.  Chest showed diffuse upper airway sounds,
diminished breath sounds, no wheezes, no crackles.
Cardiovascular examination was a regular rate and rhythm, a
II/VI systolic murmurs and distant heart sounds.  Abdominal
examination was soft, mild right upper quadrant and
epigastric tenderness, obese, no rebound tenderness, and
normal bowel sounds.  Extremities: minimal bilateral lower
extremity edema, 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses and 2+ radial
pulses bilaterally.  Neurologic examination: she was alert
and oriented times three, pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light, and she had 2+ patellar and biceps deep
tendon reflexes bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Included a white count of 7.3, with a
differential of 72 neutrophils, 10 lymphs, 10 monos, 8
atypical cells, and 7 nucleated red cells, a hematocrit of
53.4, and platelets of 243,000.  Her PT was 44.6, PTT of
49.2, INR of 13.5.  Chem 7 was sodium 142, potassium 6.6
which was hemolyzed, chloride 100, bicarbonate 28, BUN 48,
creatinine 1.8, and glucose 116.  Calcium of 8.9,
phosphorus 3.5, magnesium of 2.2, ionized calcium of 0.94,
albumin of 3.8.  CKs were 118, 148, 53 with negative MB
indexes and one troponin level of less than 0.3.
Theophylline level was 3.0.

Chest x-ray showed enlarged heart, symmetric increased
opacification of lung fields, possibly due to congestive
heart failure, tracheostomy in good position, and bilateral
effusions.  Head CT scan was negative for an acute
intracranial process.  Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus
rhythm at 69 and no ST-T-wave changes from previous
electrocardiogram.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Since being transferred to the floor on
[**2109-8-7**], the patient has continued to have stable
respiratory status on approximately 50% FiO2 by tracheostomy
mask, which appears to be at or near her baseline levels.
She continues to be treated with Levaquin for this possible
pneumonia, although she has remained afebrile throughout her
course.

DISPOSITION:  She was evaluated by Physical Therapy and it
was determined that this patient would benefit from short
term rehabilitation prior to returning home.  Therefore, this
patient is being discharged today to short term
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Hypercapnic respiratory failure.
2.  Possible pneumonia.
