hematuria

continuous bladder irrigation

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12236**] is an 81 year old gentleman with a history of
prostate cancer in remission, COPD, HTN, abestosis, dementia,
likely malignant pulmonary nodule who initially presented to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED on [**2-10**]
after 1 day of urinary incontinence and gross hematuria at home.
In ED, afebrile, BP 107/70, HR 102, RR 16, 95% RA  although he
reportedly had labile HR in the ED, ranging from 80s to 140s as
well as O2 desaturation requiring 4L of NC. He was found to have
ARF with a Cr of 1.7 (from BL 1.0), and BUN in 50s. Hct was 30
at his baseline. He was found to have frank blood clots in his
urine and was started on CBI. Urology consulted and thought c/w
radiation cystitis. While in the ED he had ~ 400 mL of coffee
ground emesis although NG lavage returned on scant amounts of
coffee grounds.  He was then admitted to the MICU for close
monitoring.
.
In the MICU, he was made NPO and started on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] and
repeat Hct had dropped to 24.7 so he received 2 unit of PRBCs
with post-transfusion Hct of 27. He had no melena or maroon
stools while in the MICU but continued to have large amounts of
blood on CBI. Repeat Hct his afternoon again down to 25.7 with
repeat 25.  Cr peaked at 2.5 and repeat this afternoon 2.4.
Initial WBC 13K increased to 27K in MICU and he was treated with
Cipro for presumed UTI. He has remained hemodynamically stable
with normal blood pressure and no tachycardia. Lisinopril and
verapamil have been held in the setting of GI bleeding. GI
planning to do EGD in am.
.
Currently, patient is without complaint. Denies fevers, chills,
cough, abdominal pain. He does recall feeling nauseous with
episode of hematemesis. Otherwise without complaints.


Past Medical History:
# COPD
# HTN
# Asbestosis
# Pulmonary nodule, ? malignant
- spiculated, RUL
- followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2168**]
- No further work-up currently due to high risks of biopsy and
potential treatment
# Prostate cancer
- [**Doctor Last Name **] [**8-31**], T2a
- s/p XRT and neoadjuvant chemotherapy, hormonal therapy
- now in remission for ~ 10 years
# Larynx tumor
- approximately 10 years ago
- reportedly benign
# Cataract in R eye
# dementia, multi-infarct
# Macular degeneration
# h/o colon polyps
# h/o neck cyst removal [**2179**]
# hearing loss
# h/o lumbar compression fracture


Social History:
Patient lives with his son, who is bipolar. He used to work in
the paint industry. He also quit smoking fifteen years ago but
has a 160 pack-year history (4ppd x ~40 years). He uses a walker
at home.

Family History:
[**Name (NI) 12237**] HTN
[**Name (NI) 12238**] "oxygen problems" ([**Name2 (NI) 1818**])
Daughter- lung cancer

Physical Exam:
T: 97.4 BP: 125/52 HR: 86 RR: 19 O2 98% RA
Gen: Pleasant, cachectic male, chronically ill appearing, NAD
HEENT: Pale conjunctiva. MMM. OP clear.
NECK: Supple, No LAD. JVP low
CV: RRR. nl S1, S2. No murmurs, rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**]
LUNGS: Decreased BS throughout.
ABD: Thin. Firm. NT, ND. +suprapubic tenderness
EXT: WWP, No edema. Full distal pulses
SKIN: No skin breakdown
NEURO: Alert and oriented x2, knows he's in hospital. Pleasant.
Follows commands. CN 2-12 grossly intact. Moving all extremities
GU: Three way foley in place draining red urine without clots

Pertinent Results:
[**2-11**] renal u/s:
1. Mild left renal hydronephrosis. Simple left renal cyst.
2. Echogenic material within the urinary bladder presumed to be
blood clot. History of hematuria is provided. No definite
etiology for hematuria is identified and MRI could be helpful
for further evaluation.
.
[**2-10**] CXR:
In comparison with study of [**2188-8-11**], there is again
hyperexpansion of the lungs with coarseness of interstitial
markings consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. Pleural
calcification is again consistent with asbestos-related
disorder.
Tip of nasogastric tube extends only to the lower esophagus.
This information was telephoned to the referring clinician by
the resident on call.


Brief Hospital Course:
81 year old male with a history of prostate cancer in remission,
COPD, HTN, abestosis, dementia, and presumed malignant pulmonary
nodule here with hematuria, ARF, leukocytosis, and coffee ground
emesis.
.
# Coffee ground emesis: Patient had initial Hct drop although he
had no recurrent hematemesis.  He underwent upper endoscopy
which revealed an ulcer at the GE junction with clot but no
evidence of active bleeding. This was not treated given its
location. Felt to be pill esophagitis vs PUD. His Hct remained
stable after 4 units of PRBCs. He was continued on PPI [**Hospital1 **] with
IV transition to po after 72 hours. His diet was advanced
following EGD without issue. He will need to have endoscopy
repeated in [**3-25**] weeks to assess for resolution per GI
recommendations.
.
# Hematuria: required CBI for >1 week while in house. Per
Urology concerned about radiation cystitis although XRT in
distant past. No obvious etiology seen on ultrasound. Patient
had persitent hematuria with clots despite multiple days of CBI.
Urology changed to larger foley catheter and after aggressive
manual irrigation, cleared multiple blood clots. A CTU was
obtained which showed nonspecific bladder wall thickening but
was otherwise unremarkable.  He was continued on CBI. It was
recommended that he have outpatient cystoscopy performed. He was
continued on oxybutynin with foley in place to prevent spasm but
that was stopped once CBI discontinued to prevent urinary
retention. He was also started on flomax. He was treated with a
7 day course of cipro for possible UTI although it was never
clear that he had active infection in his urine. PSA was normal.
Foley removed upon discharge and was able to urinate
.
# ARF: Cr 1.7 on admission, from baseline 1.0. Peak in ICU 2.5
and then downtrended to settle around 1.2.  Initially concern
for obstructive pathology given clots and hematuria but renal
u/s showed only unlateral hydronephrosis.  Thought to be most
likely pre-renal ARF due to acute GI bleed which resolved to IVF
and blood transfusions. He had a CTU performed which showed
renal cysts without other abnormality.  His lisinopril was held
in the setting of ARF.
.
# leukocytosis: unclear source at this time.  Left shifted.
Given known GU pathology, would make this most likely source
although U/A was unrevealing and urine cultures were negative.
No other obvious source of infection outside GU tract. CXR
without obvious infiltrate although known lung nodule could
predispose to pneumonia or superinfection. No diarrhea. Mental
status at baseline. Could also be stress response in the setting
of GU and GI processes. WBC count trended down and he received a
7 day course of cipro.
.
# COPD: no spirometry in our system but severe emphysema on CT
chest 10/[**2188**]. Former tobacco use.  He received alb/atrovent
nebs
.
# htn: normotensive in setting of GIB and verapamil and
lisinopril held. Once stabilized, BPs increased and verapamil
was restarted at low dose. Lisinopril was restarted without
change in creatinine and improvement in hypertensive episodes
.
# Code: FULL for now confirmed with HCP. However patient's PCP
feels that son who has untreated bipolar does not have capacity
to make decisions for patient.  Social work and social services
involved.
.
# Comm: A family meeting was held on [**2189-2-18**] with discussion
about his HCP.  Discussion included the patient's extensive care
requirements.  The patient does have care requirements that
exceed those that his family is able to provide.  Prior to
discharge from [**Hospital1 1501**], the PCP (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] should be
contact[**Name (NI) **])
