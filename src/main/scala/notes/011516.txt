<br>
The patient was in his USOH until [**2166-10-13**] when he presented to
the OSH with mild, substernal to right-sided chest pressure,
without radiation or associated N/V, SOB, LHD, palpitations.
His first set of enzymes were negative, but subsequently peaked
to CK of 155 (MB 10.5 with index 6.8%) and troponin I of 9.65.
He was started on heparin gtt and continued on ASA, Plavix,
statin and beta blocker.  He complained of RUQ pain and had an

Cardiac Catheterizaiton

BRIEF HISTORY:
Mr [**Known lastname 62612**] is an 88 year old male with a history of diabetes,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia and known CAD with cathin [**2163**]
which showed
totally occluded LAD, 80% LCX and 80% PDA who was admitted with
chest
pain. Pt with [**Hospital 7792**] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Coronary artery disease, NSTEMIS, preop evaluation.

PROCEDURE:
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 6 French left [**Last Name (un) 2699**] catheter,
advanced
to the ascending aorta through a 6 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 6
French JL4 and a 6 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.

Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

TECHNICAL FACTORS:
Total time (Lidocaine to test complete) = 35 minutes.
Arterial time = 29 minutes.
Fluoro time = 9.7 minutes.
Contrast:
          Non-ionic low osmolar (isovue, optiray...), vol 60 ml
Anesthesia:
          1% Lidocaine subq.
Anticoagulation:
          Heparin 0 units IV
Cardiac Cath Supplies Used:
          100CC MALLINCRODT, OPTIRAY 100CC


COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
3 vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had dual os and had
no
angiographically apparent flow limiting lesions. The LAD was a
small
vessel with a 95% stenosis in the mid vessel. The LCX was a
large vessel
and had a 90% mid vessel stenosis. The RCA was dominant and was
a small
vessel with diffuse disease. There was a 90% stenosis in the mid
RCA.
The RCA gave rise to the PDA which had a 90% stenosis.
2. Limited resting hemodynamic revealed elevated systemic
pressures.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred dur to renal
insufficiency.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Angiograohic evidence of three vessel coronary artery
disease.
2. Elevated systemic pressures.

[**2166-10-22**] ERCP:
Medications: Cetacaine topical spray
Fentanyl 75 micrograms
Phenergan 6.25 mg
Glucagon 0.2 mg
Midazolam 2.5mg

ASA Class: P2
Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential
complications were explained to the patient's parent or
guardian, who indicated his understanding and signed the
corresponding consent forms. A physical exam was performed. The
patient was administered Conscious sedation anesthesia. The
patient was placed in the prone position and an endoscope was
introduced through the mouth and advanced under direct
visualization until the second part of the duodenum was reached.
Careful visualization was performed. The procedure was not
difficult. The quality of the preparation was good. The patient
tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications.
Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: Normal major papilla
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast
medium was injected resulting in complete opacification.
Biliary Tree: Many stones ranging in size from 5mm to 15mm were
seen at the common bile duct. A sphincterotomy was performed in
the 12 o'clock position using a sphincterotome over an existing
guidewire. Many various sized stones and sludge were extracted
successfully using a 15 mm balloon.
Impression: 1. Choledocholithiasis

2. Sphincterotomy and balloon sweep yielding multiple variable
sized stones and sludge.

Recommendations: NPO overnight , then advance diet as tolerated
in AM.
Follow-up with referring physician
[**Name9 (PRE) **] [**Name9 (PRE) 4532**] for 1 week
Additional notes: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
(attending physician) and ERCP fellow.
