LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white count was 16.3,
hematocrit 34; ABG 7.29, 53, 382, lactate 3.0.

Chest x-ray showed no significant cardiopulmonary
abnormalities with a left clavicle fracture.  Head CT showed
three intraparenchymal areas suspicious for hemorrhage and
diffuse external injury.  No fractures were noted.

CT of the neck was negative.  CT of the abdomen showed a
grade 3 splenic laceration.  CT of the spine showed multiple
transverse process fractures of L1 through L3.  CT of the
pelvis showed the right acetabular fracture.  Right wrist
x-ray was negative.  Left wrist x-ray was negative as well.

The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.  The
plan was for TLSO brace for the fracture.  He is to have
touchdown weightbearing for the acetabular fracture.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  The patient was admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit and had serial hematocrits measured for
the splenic laceration.  The patient's hematocrit remained
stable throughout.  The patient was extubated on hospital day
#2 with no complications.

The patient had respiratory distress after five hours of
extubation and was reintubated.  Neurology was consulted, and
repeat head CT was performed.  The patient also began to
spike fevers to 101??????.  CBC, chest x-ray, blood cultures and
urine cultures were obtained.  The patient's chest x-ray
showed a possible pneumonia and was placed on antibiotic
therapy for 14 days.

The patient was also deemed to be a heroine addict prior to
admission, and per Neurology, he was placed on a Methadone
taper.  The patient's condition improved significantly after
antibiotics and Methadone were started.  He was extubated
again on posttrauma day #5.

The patient's repeat CAT scan showed diffuse axonal injury,
hemorrhages, small multiple hemorrhages, and a small frontal
subdural, no change from previous.

On [**12-3**], an addiction consult was obtained for opiate
withdraw.  They advised continue Methadone taper until
[**2100-12-8**].  Psychiatry was also consulted.  They
advised using Haldol p.r.n. and continuing the Methadone
taper as well.

On [**12-4**], the patient was transferred to the floor in a
TLSO brace for the L1-L3 fracture, on the Methadone taper and
on Dicloxacillin, Levofloxacin on both days #4 out of 7.

The patient continued to do well with a stable hematocrit and
continued to be afebrile throughout the hospitalization.

An MRI was obtained to further assess for changes,
considering the patient's slightly lethargic mental status.
Repeat MRI was done on [**2100-12-6**], which showed no
changes compared to the head CT with multiple small bleeds,
right frontal small subdural and diffuse axonal injury.

The patient did well on the floor.  He had Physical Therapy
and Occupational Therapy working with him and was screened
for rehabilitation.  The patient completed his course of
antibiotics and was discharged in stable condition on
[**2100-12-9**], to a head trauma rehabilitation facility.

clavicle fracture was stable with no neurovascular compromise
of the left arm.  The left arm was immobilized.  There were
no fractures of the wrist.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post motor vehicle collision.
2.  Multiple intracranial hemorrhages.
3.  Right frontal subdural hematoma.
4.  Diffuse axonal injury.
5.  Grade 3 splenic laceration.
6.  Transverse process fractures of L1-L3.
7.  Right acetabular fracture.
8.  Left clavicular fracture.
9.  Opiate dependence.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Percocet [**1-28**] tab p.o. q.4-6 hours,
Acetaminophen 325 p.o. q.4-6 hours p.r.n. pain, Haldol 2 mg
