Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
[**Hospital 7792**] transfer from OSH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization x 2


History of Present Illness:
75 yo male with PMH of CHF, hyperlipidemia , ESRD (on HD), HTN,
GERD, DM-II, PAF, and PVD who is transferred from [**Hospital 16186**] for NSTEMI. The patient was recently discharged from
[**Hospital1 18**] for gastroparesis, and presented to [**Hospital3 **] from
his home for respiratory distress and chest pain. On
presentation there, cardiac enzymes were cycled and his troponin
1.424 -> 5.116 -> 6.993 -> 4.905. He was thought to have
pulmonary edema in the setting of NSTEMi, and required 6L O2 to
maintain O2 sats. He was admitted to the ICU there. Prior to
transfer, it was reported that he brady'ed to the 30s, but after
further investigation, realized this did not happen. On arrival
to our CCU, he was satting well on 2L NC. He was transferred for
NSTEMI and cardiac catheterization. At Sturdy, he was continued
on his ASA, plavix, and placed on a heparin gtt. He was also
hyperkalemic, and was dialyzed prior to transfer. On arrival, he
was chest pain free and without complaints. He only would like
to eat something.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He reports exertional buttock and calf pain thought does not do
much activity. All of the other review of systems were negative.

.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope. He reports recently
worsening dyspnea

in I, aVL, II, III, aVF, V4-V6
.
ECG [**12-25**] -
Atrial fibrillation. Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave

abnormalities. The ST-T wave changes are diffuse. Clinical
correlation is
suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2187-12-17**] no significant

CXR [**12-25**]:

FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**12-15**], there is persistent
enlargement
of the cardiac silhouette with tortuosity of the aorta and
calcification in
the transverse arch. The pulmonary vessels are minimal engorged.
The left
costophrenic angle has been excluded from the image. On the
right _____ there
is opacification along the lower chest wall with blunting of the
costophrenic
angle. This could represent pleural fluid or thickening. No
evidence of
acute focal pneumonia.

IMPRESSION: Little overall change

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2187-12-6**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical akinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 50%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

ETT: none
