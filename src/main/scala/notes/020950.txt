Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD


History of Present Illness:
86 year old male with brittle TIDM, aortic insufficiency, and
CKD presents with chest pain. The pain woke the patient from
sleep last night. He felt a tightness in his anterior chest that
wrapped around his chest like someone was tightening a towel
around him. It lasted till the morning, and he can't recall when
it stopped. His wife reports that he felt like food was caught
in his stomach at dinner and he had a need to vomit. He also
developed the hiccups and a headache, both rare for him. He
denies exertional pain, denies diaphoresis, nausea, or
associated shortness of breath. He denies any fever, chills,
cough, nausea, vomiting. He never had significant chest pain
before.

The patient has been compliant with a new, more conservative
insulin regimen since his last admission [**2195-7-10**], but recently
lost control. He reports feeling thirsty the past few days, and
developing suprapubic pain from not voiding. He otherwise denies
fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, chills, or headache over the
past few days. He recently traveled to [**Hospital3 **], has not had
recent antibiotics.

In the emergency room, initial vitals were T 97.4 HR 96 BP
157/40 RR 22 O2 100%. EKG showed 1st degree block, RBBB, no ST
elevation, T-wave flattening in III and AVF, T-wave inversions
V1-V3. Initial labs in ED were notable for trop of 0.20, Na was
119, K 5.8, bicarb 6 with AG of 24, BUN/Cr 82/3.7, baseline ~
60/2.5. CBC shows leukocytosis of 21.7, with left shift 90.9%N.
H/H 10.5/33.9, platelets 403. Rectal exam was heme negative.

A CXR showed a heart of normal size, opacity behind heart
cosistent with hiatal hernia, rotated lungs are clear, no
effusions.

His pain responded to nitroglycerin and he was bolused with 5000
units heparin and started on a heparin drip. He was given 81mg
ASA, cardiology saw him and agreed. He was bolused 10U insulin
and started 8 units/hr. Access with two peripherals 20 guage.

Studies:
CXR [**2195-8-6**]
FINDINGS:  Single frontal portable view of the chest was
obtained.  The
patient is rotated with respect to the film and is in lordotic
position.  The  heart is of normal size.  A large hiatal hernia
is similar to prior.  Lungs are clear without focal or diffuse
abnormality.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
radiopaque foreign body.  Mild degenerative changes are present
in bilateral glenohumeral joints.
IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.

Echocardiogram [**2195-8-7**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with antero-lateral hypokinesis. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve is not well seen. There is no
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is
likely related to high cardiac output. Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mitral regurgitation is present but cannot be
quantified (? Mild to moderate?). The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. EF 50%.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2193-11-19**],
regional LV systolic dysfunction is new.

CXR ([**8-7**]): IMPRESSION:  Since moderate cardiomegaly has
worsened, it is possible that increased caliber to the upper
mediastinum, particularly to the right, could be due to venous
engorgement.  There is no way that I can exclude a small
mediastinal hematoma, but it would be reasonable to follow this
with conventional radiographs rather than jump to a chest CT
scan.  Ther
