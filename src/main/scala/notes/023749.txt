History of Present Illness:
76 y/o male with MS [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 103518**] elements, with recent
admission to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2166-6-26**] - [**2166-7-19**] for aspiration
pneumonia and repeated aspiration events, status post trach
([**2166-7-16**]) and G-tube placement, now presenting from [**Hospital1 **] ICU
with respiratory distress and increased secretions that are
difficult to clear. Per OSH records, pt has had at least 2
hospitalizations for aspiration vs pneumonia since trach
placement in [**Month (only) 216**].  Most recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 882**]
from [**Date range (1) 64240**], found to have LLL pna and ESBL E coli in sputum
and currently treated with ertopenem.  Presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**10-26**] from [**Hospital1 1501**] due to increased secretions and
decreased O2 sats and concern for possible tube feeds in
respiratory secretions.  He remained afebrile with stable vital
signs, without leukocytosis. Blood cx grew GPC in [**12-10**] bottles,
sputum grew sparse GNRs.  CXR on HD#1 showed retrocardiac
opacity c/f infiltrate, however this opacity had resolved on
repeat CXR HD#2.  At [**Hospital1 **] had emergent bronch for bradycardia
and hypoxia, per report large thick secretion removed from BIM
and LMB. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for trach replacment.

Of note, pt also found to be anemic with guaiac postiive stool
c/f GI bleed given history of previous GIB.  Received 2u pRBCs.
GI service consulted, recommended trending Hct and transfusing
as needed, IV PPI - pt is at high risk for invasive GI
procedures.
.
On arrival to the MICU, pt is awake and alert, unable to provide
detailed history but answers yes/no questions.  States his
breathing is currently comfortable.  Denies pain or other
complaints

Brief Hospital Course:
76 y/o male with MS [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) 103518**] elements status post trach
and G-tube placement and recent ESBL pna admitted to OSH for
hypoxia and increased trach secretions and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for trach replacement.

# Trach tube - Interventional pulmonology was called to evaluate
for trach tube replacement. They felt that the diameter of the
tube was not large enough for suctioning of secretions. The tube
was replaced by IP while on the floor and patient had
improvement in ability to clear secretions.  Patient was
initally maintained on 40% O2 via trach mask, but was
transitioned to room air with 100% saturations.

# Pneumonia - Continued ertopenem for ESBL pneumonia and
completed prior hospital course.  [**Hospital3 4107**] records
demonstrated patient growing pan-sensitive pseudomonus from
sputum culture on [**10-28**].  This was felt to be a chronic
colonizer rather than infectious [**Doctor Last Name 360**] as patient had clear CXR,
normal WBC, afebrile and had baseline oxygen requirements.
Treatment of this culture finding was defered.

# GPC Bacteremia - One of four bottles at outside hospital were
found to be positive for coag negative staph. Assumed to be a
contaminate given his clinical status. Initially started on
vancomycin, then stopped when speciated.

# Anemia - Hct to 21 while at outside hospital, received 2
units. Did not require additional PRBCs at [**Hospital1 18**]. Hct was
monitored and remained stable at 29.

# Multiple Sclerosis:  stable, continued on home medications.

# Coronary Artery Disease:  stable, issue continued on home
medications including [**Hospital1 4532**].

# Hyperlipidemia:  stable issue, continued on home medications.


# Hypertension:  stable issue, continued on home medications.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-blood cultures from [**10-28**] were no growth to date at the time of
discharge
