CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hemoptysis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old
male smoker with a history of Stage 3 nonsmall cell lung
cancer who was admitted to [**Hospital1 2177**] on [**2149-11-13**] after
having 500 cc of hemoptysis and associated shortness of
breath that morning.  Of note, the patient was treated with
radiation and Taxol/Carboplatin from [**2149-10-1**] through
[**2149-11-6**] with a seemingly good response.  One day
prior to admission at the [**Hospital1 2177**], he was seen in
Hematology/[**Hospital **] Clinic for a complaint of increasing
lethargy and shortness of breath; a chest x-ray done at that
time demonstrated a new left lung air/fluid level.

A bronchoscopy done [**2149-11-13**] at [**Hospital1 2177**] demonstrated blood
in the trachea, minimal right-sided blood without active
bleeding, and white, friable mucosa in the left main stem
bronchus with narrowing of the lumen, significant enough to
prevent passage of the bronchoscope; blood was seen distal to
the obstruction.  At the end of this procedure, the left main
stem bronchus was obstructed with a bronchial balloon.  On
[**2149-11-14**], a bronchial artery angiogram was performed
with a goal of embolizing the bleeding source.  Given the
complex vascular supply of the tumor, however, the procedure
was aborted.  On the night prior to transfer to the [**Hospital6 1760**], the patient had an
additional 300 cc of hemoptysis with an associated drop in
his systolic blood pressure to the 80s and was therefore
started on a Dopamine drip.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Stage 3A nonsmall cell (squamous
type) lung cancer diagnosed in [**2149-8-11**], status post
Taxol/Carboplatin as above, status post radiation, status
post bone scan [**2149-9-15**] (no metastases), pulmonary
function tests with a FEV 1 of 1.0 (not a surgical
candidate); 2.  Hypothyroidism; 3.  Hypercholesterolemia; 4.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease; 5.  Congestive heart
failure; 6.  Blood loss anemia secondary to gastritis.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Midazolam GTT titrated to sedation;
Dopamine GTT at 10 mcg/hr; Metronidazole 500 mg intravenously
q. 8 hours; Ceftriaxone 1 gm intravenously q. day; Ranitidine
50 mg intravenously q. 8 hours; Albuterol metered dose
inhaler 10 puffs q. 1 hr prn; Epotropium 10 puffs q. 4 hours
prn.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  100 pack year smoking history, no ethyl
alcohol.  Lives in [**Location 8391**], retired supermarket clerk.
Married with four children.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died of lung cancer at age 57, father
died secondary to coronary artery disease at age 70, brother
died secondary to coronary artery disease at age 55, sister
with breast cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On initial physical examination the
patient's temperature was 98.0?????? F., his temperature maximum
from earlier in the day was 102, heartrate 69 to 97, blood
pressure 99 to 110/50 to 60, and mean blood pressure of 66 to
99.  He was on a mechanical ventilator set at assist control
350/20/0.50/5, and arterial blood gases done on those
settings was 7.34/38/82.  His peak pressure was 20 and his
plateau pressure was 14.  In general, he was sedated, and on
a ventilator.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination,
his conjunctivae were clear, and his pupils were pinpoint.
His neck was soft and supple and there was no
lymphadenopathy.  His heart was regular rate and rhythm,
there were normal S1 and S2 heartsounds.  There was a II/VI
systolic ejection murmur at the bilateral upper sternal
border and there were no rubs or gallops.  His lung sounds
were coarse anteriorly.  There were faint breathsounds over
the left anterior chest wall.  His abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended, and there were normoactive bowel
sounds.  His extremities were warm, there were 2+ radial
pulses.  Dorsalis pedis pulses were dopplerable, and there
was no edema.  He had no skin rashes or lesions,

LABORATORY DATA:   Initial laboratory evaluation demonstrated
a white blood cell count of 4.4, hematocrit of 34.8 and
platelets of 237,000.  His INR was 1.4.  Initial serum
chemistries demonstrated sodium 140, potassium 3.5,
bicarbonate 21, chloride 111, BUN 6, creatinine 0.5 and
glucose 126.  His calcium was 6.1, magnesium 1.7, phosphate
1.2 and ionized calcium 0.98.

A bronchoscopy done on admission demonstrated an oropharynx
within normal limits; trachea deviated to the left but
otherwise within normal limits; right airways within normal
limits; left main stem bronchus obstructed by tumor versus
clot, this area was suctioned, and argon beam coagulation
destruction and airway debridement was performed.  A 10 by 40
Ultraflex left lower lobe stent and a 12 by 40 Polyflex left
main stem bronchus stent were placed with visualization into
good position; the patient was reintubated bronchoscopically
with the endotracheal tube at 25 cm following this procedure.
The post procedure chest x-ray demonstrated some aeration of
the left lung, right lower lobe effusion versus infiltrate.
An outside chest x-ray reportedly demonstrated left lung
opacification and right lower lobe effusion versus
infiltrate.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Hemoptysis - There was active bleeding
seen at the time of initial bronchoscopy, of which the most
likely source was the patient's malignancy.  This bleeding
likely originated either from erosion of the tumor into small
pulmonary vessels or from erosion or trauma to the vascular
supply to the tumor itself.  The patient had some mild post
procedural hemoptysis, although his bloody secretions rapidly
tapered off.  He had no further significant clinical
hemoptysis during this hospitalization.

2.  Post obstructive pneumonia - The fluid that was released
following the tumor destruction and airway debridement in the
initial bronchoscopy did not have the appearance of frank
blood, but rather had a somewhat purulent appearance,
(slightly yellowish).  This gross finding raised the
possibility of a post obstructive anaerobic pneumonia.
Although the patient did not have an elevated white blood
count, he was febrile to 102 prior to admission.  He was
therefore started on Clindamycin 600 mg intravenously q. 8
hours for anaerobic coverage; this antibiotic was continued
throughout his hospitalization.  He was also continued on the
Ceftriaxone 1 gm intravenously q. 24 hours that had been
started at the outside hospital.  His white blood cell count
remained normal throughout his admission and he also remained
afebrile throughout his admission.

3.  Airway obstruction - The patient had a significant airway
obstruction from his tumor that was largely relieved by the
tumor destruction and airway debridement during the initial
bronchoscopy as noted above; in addition, two stents were
placed in an attempt to maintain airway patency.  A post
procedural chest x-ray demonstrated increased aeration of the
left lung, and breathsounds were heard over the left anterior
chest wall following this initial procedure.  On hospital day
#4, the patient underwent a second bronchoscopy, during which
his proximal stent was repositioned 1.5 cm proximally.  The
patient continued to have improved air movement following
this repositioning of the stent.  He was successfully
extubated on [**2149-11-18**], and remained on oxygen by nasal
cannula ranging from 4 to 6 liters following his extubation.
He required minimal suction with the Yankauer catheter
following his extubation; the patient was capable of clearing
his own secretions with this catheter.  His oxygen saturation
remained between 94 and 98% on 4 to 6 liters of nasal cannula
following his extubation.

4.  Hypotension - The patient reportedly became hypotensive
on the morning of [**11-14**], after having a second episode of
massive hemoptysis at the outside hospital and he
subsequently required Dopamine to maintain his blood
pressure.  He was transfused a total of 4 units of packed red
blood cells at the outside hospital, and he did not have
evidence of hypovolemia on admission to the [**Hospital6 1760**].  He was gradually weane
