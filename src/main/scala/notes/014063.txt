MICROBIOLOGIC DATA:
[**2122-1-27**] Blood culture (x 2) - pending
[**2122-1-27**] MRSA screen - pending
[**2122-1-27**] urine culture - <[**Numeric Identifier 961**] organisms
.
IMAGING STUDIES:
[**2122-1-27**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - Two portable AP views of the chest
are compared to previous exam from [**2121-12-25**]. There is
stable right basilar opacity compatible with patient's known
lung mass. Elsewhere, the lungs are grossly clear.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is again notable for thickening of
the right paratracheal stripe compatible with known mediastinal
adenopathy. Osseous and soft tissue structures are grossly
unremarkable.
.
[**2122-1-27**] CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CON -  No evidence of a
retroperitoneal hematoma. Markedly increased retrocrural,
retroperitoneal, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy, as described
above. Incompletely evaluated large right lower lobe pulmonary
mass, not significantly changed in size compared to CT from
[**2121-12-15**]. [**Doctor Last Name **]-type ventral abdominal wall hernia,
involving the transverse colon. No evidence of obstruction or
strangulation. Non-specific lucency within the left iliac bone,
not significantly changed in appearance.
.
LENIS [**1-28**]: IMPRESSION: No bilateral lower extremity DVT.

Brief Hospital Course:
53M with NSCLC SCC stage IV (brain met s/p resection and
cyberknife) s/p C1 of carboplatin gemcitabine on [**1-20**] who
presented to clinic with fatigue found to have a HCT of 17 now
s/p ICU stay with 5 units PRBCs.
.
# GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING - Patient had guaiac positive stool
in the ED (confirmed by GI physician) with an unsuccessful
nasogastric lavage. There was initial concern for upper
gastrointestinal bleeding given his hematocrit of 17% (10% drop
since [**2122-1-20**]) - though that was after transfusion for a
hematocrit of 23% on [**2122-1-15**]. Patient has been taking  Ibuprofen
for headache while on steroids, which could predispose the
patient to gastritis among other issues. Patient does report
history of polyps on colonoscopy 6-years prior and has known
diverticular disease, which could be a source for lower GI
bleeding. We initiated a Protonix infusion following a bolus and
consulted the GI specialists. He w
