Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3918**]
Chief Complaint:
hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Flexible bronchoscopy x 2
Rigid bronchoscopy with argon cauterization

endotracheal intubation x2

History of Present Illness:
64yoF w/ recent large B cell lymphoma in L suprahilar region
diagnosed in [**4-/2141**] s/p 6 cycles [**Hospital1 **], w/ episodes of PE in
[**2140**] and more recently in [**June 2141**] now on coumadin, p/w
hemoptysis. Pt began having scant hemoptysis on [**2141-11-2**], but
then on evening of [**2141-11-4**] had 10 episodes where she coughed up
"quarter-sized" bloodclots. She then presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**],
where she underwent CTA, showing L hilar mass anterior to L main
pulmonary artery 4cm in size occluding the LUL main bronchus.
Given location and impingement on upper lobe bronchus, patient
had bronchoscopy. There was initally concern for erosion into
the PA, but our IP doctors here are [**Name5 (PTitle) **] concerned about the L
upper lobe bronchial artery eroding and requested transfer here.
Of note, before transfer had received CTX x1 w/ bronchoscopy.
.
In the ICU, patient c/o some subjective SOB, which she states
has been present since the bronchoscopy. Denies further episodes
of hemoptysis. Denies fatigue/weakness. Does endorse some
wheezing, better than it has been in the past. Denies
fevers/chills. No CP, no abd pain/N/V.
.
Also of note, patient is being treated for UTI w/ macrodantin,
started on [**2141-11-1**] for complaints of dysuria. She had been
treated with a three day course 3 weeks prior, and stated her
symptoms never got better, so it was decided to give her another
extended course. No UA/culture was sent. No current urinary
symptoms.

lungs: CTAB
abd: soft, nt, nd + bs
ext: no c/c/e

Pertinent Results:
[**2141-11-5**] Pathology from bronchial washings
Left upper lobe, bronchial washings, cell block:
     - ATYPICAL.
     - Rare atypical poorly-preserved epithelial cells, cannot
exclude involvement by non-small cell lung carcinoma.
Immunohistochemical stains could not be interpreted due to scant
tumor cells.

[**2141-11-6**] CXR
Increase in density of large left hilar mass. As the patient is
experiencing
hemoptysis and the mass was associated with obstruction of the
left upper lobe
bronchus on prior PET CT of [**2141-10-30**], consider
bronchoscopy for further
evaluation if not already performed.

[**2141-11-10**] Renal u/s
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 12.2 cm in its long axis and
shows no
masses, stones or hydronephrosis.

The left kidney measures 10.6 cm in its long axis. Off the
inferior pole of
the left kidney is an exophytic anechoic structure that measures
4.5 x 4.7 x
4.0 cm and shows through transmission and is most consistent
with a cyst. It
exhibits no abnormal vascularity.

Transverse and sagittal views of the bladder show it to be
collapsed as the
patient had recently voided.

IMPRESSION: Left lower renal pole simple cyst.




Brief Hospital Course:
64yoF w/ recent large B cell lymphoma in L suprahilar region
diagnosed in [**4-/2141**] s/p 6 cycles [**Hospital1 **], w/ episodes of PE in
[**2140**] and more recently in [**June 2141**] now on coumadin, p/w
hemoptysis.

MICU [**Location (un) **] Course: [**Date range (3) 83472**]
Patient was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] for further management
of hemoptysis in the setting of a bleeding vessel from her
tumor. Here, interventional pulmonary was consulted and
performed a flexible bronchoscopy which showed a fungating mass
in the left upper lobe with a bleeding vessel. Patient was taken
for rigid bronchoscopy in OR for debulking of tumor and argon
cauterization. After the OR, patient was brought back to the ICU
intubated because of paralytic received in OR. Patient was
extubated in ICU when she was responding to commands. However
upon extubation, patient became extremely tachypneic and
cyanotic, requiring reintubation. It was unclear why patient had
acute respiratory distress but may have been [**2-28**] flash pulmonary
edema v. bronchospasm v. obstruction from tumor. Patient was
diuresed and transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **] ICU for XRT prior to
extubation.

Of note patient was started on Macrodantin as outpatient for UTI
however urine cultures were negative so this was dc'ed.

Also of note, patient has h/o PE for which she is coumadin.
Prior to the bronchoscopy, INR was reversed with FFP.
Anticoagulation was not restarted given h/o hemoptysis.

In [**Name (NI) 153**], pt was extubated without complications and maintained
O2 sat in mid-high 90s on 2L of NC.  Was transferred to the
floor for further managment while receiving XRT.  Pathology
preliminary report received after day one of XRT to chest,
bronchial washings were not suggestive of lymphoid cells.  XRT
was held until final path report which showed atypical cells,
cannot r/o nonsmall cell lung cancer, but it was recommended
that more tissue be obtained to make a diagnosis.  Bronchoscopy
is scheduled for [**11-17**] in order to obtain more tissue and until
then, radiation treatments are on hold.

Hemoptysis did not continue after extubation and transfer to BMT
floor and sats improved, pt only required 2L NC of O2 at night
(which she is on at home) at time of discharged and stated she
was breathing better.  Coumadin and aspirin were held during her
course on the BMT floor considering her presentation with
hemoptysis and she was advised to continue not taking these
medications until a diagnosis and treatment plan have been
determined.  Her home blood pressure meds and other cardiac
medications were continued, as well as her home meds for her
COPD.
