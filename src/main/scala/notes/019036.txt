Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Salicylates

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred to CCU with pericardial effusion/tamponade s/p VT
ablation.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VT ablation (unsuccessful), PA line placement,
pericardiocentesis.

History of Present Illness:
88yoF with nonischemic dilated CM (EF 30%), 4+ AI, and history
of VT s/p [**First Name3 (LF) 3941**], PAF on coumadin and amiodarone, who presented to
cardiologist ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 45945**], [**Hospital3 **]) on [**11-22**] with
persistent slow VT.  Plan was made for VT ablation in early
[**Month (only) 404**]; on [**12-2**], Pt. became acutely SOB, worsening during night,
with increased orthopnea, presented to OSH on [**12-3**] in am.  Pt.
also noted increased LE edema, DOE, but denied
palpitations/cp/pressure/PND.  Pt. was found to be in slow VT
alternating with NSR.
.
Pt. was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for VT ablation.  LV mapping was
limited, and a large apical scar was identified.  SBP went from
140s to 100s and an intra-procedure echo showed a pericardial
effusion, which may have resulted from a small myocardial
perforation. Lidocaine 50mg was given to try to break VT; Pt.
became hypotensive and bradycardic, given atropine, and paced
out of VT.  375cc of bloody fluid was removed from the
pericardial space with marked improvement in systolic blood
pressure. The pericardial pressure decreased to 3mmHg after
removal of fluid. The cardiac index markedly improved to 3.1
L/min/m2 (from 1.6) after removal of fluid.  For recurrent VT, a
second dose of lidocaine 50mg was given.  The [**Hospital1 3941**] leads were
reprogrammed for AV-pacing at 100bpm to suppress VT. A
pericardial drain was left in place and the patient was
transferred in stable clinic to the CCU.


Past Medical History:
1. idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy/nonischemic.
2. h/o VT, with [**Company **] [**Last Name (un) **] DR [**Last Name (STitle) 3941**], last generator change

3. AS, 4+ AI, PAF, EF preserved on past records but recently
reported as 30%.
4. CHF with systolic and diastolic failure.
5. apical aneurysm with nonobstructive CAD on cath.
6. hypothyroidism.
7. CRI (Cr 1.6-2.0 as of [**2-2**]).
8. GERD.
9. chronic anemia, on epogen.

Pertinent Results:
ECG [**2120-12-4**]: AV-paced at 100bpm.
.
Cardiac Catheterization [**2120-12-4**]: Severe pericardial tamponade. 2.
Hemodynamic improvement with drainage of pericardial fluid.
COMMENTS: 1. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and
left-sided filling pressures (mean RA 13 mmHg, mean PCW 20mmHg).
PA pressure was mildly elevated at 38/15. The cardiac index was
moderately depressed at 1.6 L/min/m2. 2. Pericardial pressure
was elevated at 14mmHg and equal to right atrial pressure. 375cc
of bloody fluid was removed from the pericardial space with
marked improvement in systolic blood pressure. The pericardial
pressure decreased to 3mmHg after removal of fluid. The cardiac
index markedly improved to 3.1 L/min/m2 after removal of fluid.
3. The pericardial drain was left in place and the patient was
transferred in stable clinic to the CCU.
.
Echo [**2120-12-4**] (#1): There is a moderate sized circumferential
pericardial effusion that measures 2 cm anterior to the right
ventricle and slightly increases in size during the course of
the study with corresponding decrease in right ventricular
cavity size/compression/tamponade physiology. A large left
ventricular apical aneurysm is identified.
.
Echo [**2120-12-4**] (#2): There is a large (6cm) apical left
ventricular aneurysm. There is a moderate to large sized (2.5cm
anterior to the right ventricle) circumferential pericardial
effusion with evidence of right ventricular diastolic collapse,
consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology. Compared
with the prior study (images reviewed) of earlier in the day),
the findings are similar.
.
Echo [**2120-12-4**] (#3): There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of
[**2120-12-4**], the pericardial effusion has resolved and the right
ventricular cavity is expanded.
.
TTE [**2120-12-5**]: There is a large left ventricular apical aneurysm.
There may be thrombus in the aneurysm. Right ventricular chamber
size is small. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is a small pericardial effusion. There
is a somewhat echodense pericardial region, particularly
posteriorly which may present residual organized effusion and/or
thickening. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
CXR [**2120-12-5**]: [**Year/Month/Day 3941**] device seen in place without evidence of
pneumothorax. Enlarged cardiac silhouette with pericardial
drains seen overlying the heart. Bilateral pleural effusions are
seen, without evidence of focal consolidations.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 88yoF with pericardial effusion/tamponade s/p VT ablation.
.
Pt. was transferred to CCU following an attempt at VT-ablation
for persistent slow VT, which was complicated by a small
myocardial perforation, which led to a pericardial
effusion/tamponade.  The Pt. underwent pericardiocentesis in the
cath lab, and approximately 375cc of serosanguinous fluid was
drained.  A drain was left in place, and was removed after 12
hours of no drainage, which occurred on day 2 following
catheterization.  Pulsus, jugular venous distension and blood
pressure were followed closely.
.
After catheterization, the Pt. was treated with mexilitine (a
Class 1b antiarrhythmic), and amiodarone, and was initially
AV-paced at 100bpm.  The Pt. was paced at a rate greater than
her usual VT-rate (90bpm) in order to decrease the probability
of conversion to VT.  The Pt. remained in normal rhythm, and
after two days of mexilitine treatment, AV-pacing was switched
to 80bpm.  The Pt. tolerated this well, and there were no
episodes of VT on continuous telemetry monitoring.  The Pt. was
also continued on metoprolol.
.
The Pt. was initially volume overloaded on exam, with symptoms
of heart failure including sh
