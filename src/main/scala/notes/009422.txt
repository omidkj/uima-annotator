History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 82 yo M with multiple medical problems including
CAD s/p MI with PCI, systolic CHF (EF of 45% in [**4-30**]), CKD
(baseline Cre 2.5-3.5), and C. difficile infection s/p total
colectomy who presents with chest pain and hypotension at rehab.
.
He was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] on [**2174-6-4**] for weakness and
discharged to [**Hospital3 **] on [**6-9**]. Per rehab records, the
patient was noted to collapse at synagogue and taken to [**Hospital1 2025**] for
evaluation. He was noted to be hypertensive to 220/100, and was
treated as a hypertensive emergency with IV lopressor. Labs
there significant for a trop-I of 0.7 (likely troponin leak in
setting of hypertension) and positive p-Mibi with decreased EF
of 38%, and a large anterior-anterolateral area of ischemia. He
was managed medically and not taken to cath [**2-22**] his ESRD and
single kidney. Negative bilateral LENIs on [**6-6**]. His hospital
course was complicated by an E. coli UTI treated with 14 days of
Aztreonam.
.
The day of admission to [**Hospital1 18**], he was noted at rehab to have
increased SOB in the morning and refusing to have his BIPAP
removed (which is used at night for OSA). O2 sats were 100% on
his BIPAP settings. CXR performed without evidence of pulmonary
edema or effusions. Patient given nebs with good effect on
oxygen saturations. Around 2:30 pm (after eating lunch), patient
c/o chest 'tightness' and O2 sat noted to be 89% on 2 L NC,
improved to 92% with 5 L. Given SL nitro 0.4 x1. SBP was 140
prior to administration of nitro. Pt then noted after
administration of nitro to become unresponsive for 30 seconds.
Unable to obtain BP at that time. Patient recovered and repeat
BP was 130/72 with O2 sat of 93% on 5 L. P alert, responsive,
stated CP relieved. Pt placed on 100% NRB with O2 sat of 96% and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further care.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.2 97 131/76 24 97%. Lab sig for
WBC of 11.0, Cre 3.3 (baseline 2.5-3.5), and trop-T of 0.06 (at
baseline). CXR no PNA, Head CT no acute ICP. Pt received Zofran
4 mg IV x1. Cards called for urgent TTE to assess for tamponade,
which showed no evidence of tamponade physiology. Unable to get
CTA given [**Hospital1 **] failure. Cardiology did not accept patient b/c
no acute cardiology issue. Outpatient cardiologist [**Hospital1 653**],
requested MICU admission.
.
In the ICU, pt reports cough productive of sputum x2 weeks. He
reports immobilization for most of rehab stay, and reports only
being sat up at the side of his bed. Reports nausea, worsening
SOB as well over the past two weeks, but denies orthopnea or
PND. Reports chest pressure today lasting about 30 minutes,
pleuritic in nature. Does not remember being syncopal or
presyncopal. No increasing [**Location (un) **] or abdominal girth. No increased
ostomy output. No vomiting. Eating and drinking well.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo M with CAD s/p recent NSTEMI on [**6-4**] who presents from
rehab with an episode of syncope after receiving SL nitro at
rehab, also worsening shortness of breath over past week.

Pneumonia: The patient had a cough productive of purulent
sputum, which became positive for MRSA.  He was treated
initially with broad spectrum antibiotics, which was later
narrowed to vancomycin. Initially started on cpap, however he
quickly worsened and required intubation.

Septic shock: The patient rapidly became septic and hypotensive
and was volume resuscitated with normal saline.  He initially
responded to this and appeared to be improving, however on
hospital day 4 the patient again became hypotensive requiring
pressor support.  The patient subsequently developed ARDS, and
after consultation with the family, pressors were allowed to run
out in accordance with orthodox [**Hospital1 **] beliefs in sustaining
life but not actively interfering with the process of dying.
The patient passed on [**2174-7-1**] at 4:50pm.
