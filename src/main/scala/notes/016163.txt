Pertinent Results:
[**2179-8-16**] Echo: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. At distal arch, saccular aortic
aneurysm is identified. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

[**2179-8-17**] CT: 1. Interval thoracic aorta stenting without evidence
of an endoleak. The aortic arch pseudoaneurysm appears
successfully excluded. 2. Persistent left pleural effusion. 3.
Multiple foci of abnormal arterial enhancement in the liver with
the largest 1.8 cm, but more geographic than mass-like. In the
absence of risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma or
hypervascular metastases, these could be followed up as part of
patient's routine follow-up protocol.  Alternatively, follow-up
imaging could be performed in three months with MRI using Eovist
to ensure stability. 4. Small hiatus hernia. 5. Diverticulosis
without evidence of diverticulitis.

solids or fluids. She received humidified oxygen with slight
improvement. She received aggressive management for hypertension
throughout hospital course with goal SBP<140. On post-op day two
she received blood transfusion for HCT of 22. HCT the following
day was 32. On post-op day 3 she was discharged home with the
appropriate medications and follow-up appointments.
