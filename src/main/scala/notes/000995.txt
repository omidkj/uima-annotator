Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8367**]
Chief Complaint:
?infected hardware

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left Obturator artery pseudoaneurysm embolization


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 14323**] is a 29 year old woman with ESRD on HD s/p failed
renal transplant (rejection [**2174**]) and s/p bilateral nephrectomy,
now s/p right tibial IMN on [**2177-6-24**] who returns from rehab with
worsening leg wound and possible infection. She also notes
worsening right knee swelling and pain.
.
Her recent admission was complicated by possible cellulitis,
which was treated with vancomycin/Zosyn to complete a 2 week
course. She was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**7-8**] and was found
hypotensive on [**7-12**] (blood cultures growing coag negative staph
sensitive to vancomycin). She received one dose of gentamicin at
that time.  She responded well to IVF. The right knee was
aspirated on [**7-15**] and showed gram positive cocci in pairs and
clusters but nothing grew in cultures.  She had a PICC line
catheter tip culture on [**7-12**] which grew coag negative staph
sensitive to vancomycin.  She had another catheter tip sent for
culture on [**7-18**] (unclear what line) which did not grow anything.
 She also underwent a debridement of the right lower extremity
wound by vascular surgery. Coumadin and heparin were
discontinued (started for DVT prophylaxis after tib/fib surgery)
and she was anticoagulated with Lovenox.
.
She was transferred back to [**Hospital1 18**] for concern for hardware
infection, and non-healing wound.  The septic knee reportedly
has improved significantly with surgery and antibiotics.
.
In the ED, vital signs were T99.1, HR 100, BP 99/50, RR 16, sat
95% on room air. She received dilaudid IV for pain, in addition
to vancomycin IV x 1 (preceded by Benadryl) and clindamycin IV x
1. She was given 2 L NS for rehydration.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She notes constipation, right lower extremity
pain (both at the site of the wound and at the knee), and low
grade temperature. She denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
shortness of [**Hospital1 1440**], dizziness, and vomiting. She has mild
numbness of the right lower extremity below the knee.

Neck: No lymphadenopathy
Cardiac: RRR, normal S1/S2, 1/6 systolic murmur at apex
Lungs: CTA bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
Abd: Soft, but distended, mildly diffusely tender, normal active
bowel sounds. No hepatosplenomegaly. Midline and bilateral
oblique scars from previous abdominal surgeries.

Neuro: A&O x 3

Pertinent Results:
.
[**7-24**] CT LLE with contrast:
1. Fluid collection due to an apparent skin defect in the
anterolateral distal calf. It may represent seroma. Abscess less
likely.
2. Distal calf intermuscular hypoattenuation which should be
followed on further series but is likely to represent muscle
edema.
3. Recent tibia and fibular fractures.
4. Subcutaneous edema in distal calf and foot.
.
8/16 L tib/fib plain film:
No definite radiographic evidence for osteomyelitis. Internally
fixated tibial fracture and impacted nondisplaced nonangulated
fibular fracture as previously described. Significant soft
tissue ulceration at the level of the fracture site.
.
[**7-24**] R knee plain film:
No definite radiographic evidence for osteomyelitis. Internally
fixated tibial fracture and impacted nondisplaced nonangulated
fibular fracture as previously described. Significant soft
tissue ulceration at the level of the fracture site.
.
Shoulder Plain film
1. Demineralization of the bones associated with a reticular
appearance, this may be seen in the setting of renal failure.
2. No erosions identified.
3. No fractures are seen.
4. Diffuse opacities within the visualized lungs, cannot exclude
underlying pneumonia.
.
R LE U/S
No evidence of DVT.
.
Bilateral arterial doppler u/s
IMPRESSION:  On the right normal arterial Doppler study _____
lower extremity at rest.  On the left there appears to be mild
tibial artery occlusive disease.
.
CXR
1.  Stable bibasilar opacities may reflect underlying pneumonia
with possible
associated atelectasis.
2.  Findings consistent with pulmonary artery hypertension.
3.  Interval removal of left-sided PICC line.
.
[**7-30**] CTA Chest with and without contrast
1.  Slightly limited study due to patient motion and
insufficient contrast -bolus, but no evidence of pulmonary
emboli.
2.  Stable extensive airspace opacities in both lungs with
ground glass
opacities with interlobular thickening. Findings are likely
related to a
combination of left ventricular heart failure superimposed on an
underlying
chronic process such as COP or lupus pneumonitis.
3.  Stable mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
4.  Enlarged pulmonary artery consistent with underlying
pulmonary arterial hypertension.
.
[**8-1**] Echocardiogram with bubble study.
IMPRESSION: No ASD/PFO seen. No evidence of endocarditis.
Possible shunting
through the pulmonary vasculature. Symmetric LVH with preserved
global and
regional systolic function. Mildly dilated right ventricle with
preserved
systolic function. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Mild
pulmonary
hypertension.
.
Compared with the prior study (images unavailable for review) of
[**2177-2-10**],  right ventricular systolic function may have slightly
improved. Severity of  mitral regurgitation appears less.
Discrete mitral valve echodensity is not appreciated on the
current study. The other findings are similar.
.
[**8-7**] CT abd/ pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1. Interval decrease in size of bilateral renal fossa fluid
collections.
2. Interval development of the presumed hematoma in the left
obturator internus muscle.
3. There is significant interval change in bibasilar
ground-glass opacities, with redemonstration of a right middle
lobe pulmonary nodule now measuring 5 mm in size.
4. Stable pelvic lymphadenopathy.
.
[**8-13**] CT abd/ pelvis: IMPRESSION:
1. Slightly worsened left lower lobe peribronchial opacity and
airspace consolidation. This nonstanding.
2. Interval expansion of the obturator internus presumed
hematoma. There is also an avidly enhancing focus here. The
findings are highly concerning for pseudoaneurysm.
3. Stable nephrectomy bed postoperative collections.
.
[**8-14**] IR embolization: IMPRESSION: Angiographically successful
embolization of left obturator artery pseudoaneurysm with
microcoils and thrombin.
