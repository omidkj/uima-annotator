Admission Date: [**2121-6-10**]        Discharge Date: [**2121-6-18**]

Date of Birth:  [**2043-7-2**]        Sex:  F

Service:  CME


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77 year-old
female with a past medical history of coronary artery disease
status post right coronary artery stent ([**10-29**]), diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, deep venous thrombosis, status post
recent axillobifemoral bypass graft on [**2121-5-6**] who is
transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**] from
[**Hospital3 **] with fever and arrhythmia.  The patient
underwent a recent bypass surgery for blue toe syndrome and
course was complicated by a polymicrobial groin site
infection, which included methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus for which the patient was treated with
one week of Vancomycin and two weeks of po Linezolid.  Her
course is also complicated by complete heart block
necessitating the placement of a DDD pacemaker, which was
placed on the [**11-12**].  The patient returned to [**Hospital3 **] on the [**11-10**] with a one week history of
shortness of breath, fatigue, fevers or chills, sweats and
right sided chest pain.  At [**Location (un) **] she was found to have six
out of six bottles that grew out coag positive staph aureus.
She was initially started on Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone on
the [**11-10**].  In addition, the patient was noted to have
a rapid irregular heart rhythm that was thought to be rapid
atrial fibrillation and was loaded with intravenous
Amiodarone.  The [**Hospital 228**] [**Hospital3 **] course is also
notable for a 2 unit packed red blood cell transfusion for a
hematocrit of 24 in the setting of guaiac positive stools and
an INR of greater then 8.0.

REVIEW OF SYMPTOMS:  Fatigue, malaise, chest pain centered
around the pacemaker insertion as well as dyspnea on
exertion, stable three pillow orthopnea and stable lower
extremity edema.  The patient denies any paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea or syncope.

alone.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient is adopted and family history is
noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.9, blood
pressure 105/48, heart rate 90, respiratory rate 27 with an
O2 sat of 98 percent on 4 liters.  The patient is found lying
flat in bed breathing comfortably in no acute distress,
anicteric.  Conjunctiva are uninjected.  Pupils are equal,
round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.
Mucous membranes are moist.  There are no sores or lesions in
the oropharynx.  There is no jugular venous distension in the
upright position.  The patient has an irregular rhythm with a
grade 2 out of 6 holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex
radiating to the axilla.  There is a normal S1 and S2.  No S3
or S4 are appreciated.  The patient has bilateral crackles
one half of the way up.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  She has 1 plus pitting
edema bilaterally.  She has 1 plus dorsalis pedis pulses and
trace posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.  There are no
rashes noted and no stigmata of endocarditis appreciated on
examination.  Neurological examination mental status the
patient is alert, oriented times three.  She has a flat
affect.  Cranial nerve examination is notable for moderate
hearing loss, otherwise unremarkable.  Upper and lower
extremity strength 4 to 5 plus and symmetric bilaterally.
Normal cerebellar examination.  Gait is not tested.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Sodium 130, potassium 8.7,
chloride 95, bicarb 21, BUN 58 creatinine 2.1, glucose 248,
white blood cell count 5 with a hematocrit of 28 and
platelets of 86.  Electrocardiogram demonstrates a paced
rhythm with atrial premature complexes, left atrial
abnormality, left bundle branch block with an
intraventricular conduction delay.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Infectious disease:  As mentioned above the patient was
   noted to have a high grade bacteremia from cultures drawn
   at the [**Hospital3 **] prior to admission.  Surveillance
   cultures following transfer continued to reveal high grade
   bacteremia with 2 out of 4 bottles that were positive on
   the 15th for gram positive cocci.  They were identified as
   MRSA.  The patient was continued on intravenous Vancomycin
   on a renally dosed basis.  Given the discomfort around her
   pacemaker site as well as fluctuance at the pacemaker
   site, as well as her frequent arrhythmia the
   Electrophysiology Service was consulted.  Subsequent ECG
   on the [**5-11**] showed what was likely to be a wide
   complex tachycardia with a left bundle branch block,
   superior axis with AV dissociation consistent with
   ventricular tachycardia.  She was subsequently noted to
   have multiple prolonged runs of wide complex tachycardia
   of 10 to 30 beats on telemetry.  Interrogation of
   pacemaker demonstrated multiple runs of ventricular
   tachycardia.  Chest film demonstrated that the A lead is
   well placed and the V lead had become dislodged.
   Subsequent fluoroscopy revealed that the V lead was
   dislodged and located in the RVOT (had been placed in the
   RVA).  The decision was made to remove the pacemaker given
   lead dislodgement and also about of concern for likely
   pacemaker infection.  An incision was made over the
   generator and a moderate amount of brown fluid was
   expressed from the pocket.  Fluid was sent for studies and
   revealed involvement with MRSA.  Pocket was extensively
   irrigated with antibiotic solution (Gentamycin and
   Vancomycin) and was debrided of necrotic appearing tissue.
   A Penrose drain was placed in the wound and the tissue was
   approximated, but not closed.

Out of concern for possible endocarditis given the
combination of high grade MRSA bacteremia, likely infected
pacer wire, which is present in the RV and RVOT as well as
newly appreciated MR murmur, the patient underwent
transesophageal echocardiogram, which did reveal mild to
moderate mitral regurgitation as well as moderate mitral
annular calcification.  An echogenic mass was seen at the
base of the posterior mitral valve leaflet consistent with a
calcified annulus, however, a vegetation in his region could
not be fully excluded.

Given the history of groin infection that included
involvement with MRSA shortly after the axillobifemoral graft
was placed as well as the high grade MRSA bacteremia, the
patient was taken for MR of the torso to ascertain whether
the axillobifemoral graft might be infected.  The MRI
revealed the graft is patent with patent proxima and distal
anastomosis though with a large amount of fluid along entire
extent of the graft that is up to 3 cm in transverse diameter
in portions.  The fluid is contained within an enhancing
capsule that is highly concerning for infectious involvement.
The patient is to undergo ultrasound guided diagno
