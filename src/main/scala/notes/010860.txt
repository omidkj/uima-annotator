Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 54 year old woman with history of morbid obesity,
obesity hypoventilation, OSA, panhypopituitarism, diastolic
congestive heart failure who presented with hypercarbic
respiratory failure was intubated and in the intensive care unit
and transferred to the medical service on [**12-12**].
.
#Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Resolved; patient is
chronically hypercarbic in the 60-70s due to chronic obstructive
sleep apnea/obesity hypoventilation syndome. In the past no
clear percipitant was found and most likely a combination of
CHF, poor underlying lung function and perhaps non compliance
with home CPAP; however, pt states that she is compliant at
home.
.
#Obesity Hypoventilation/Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Chronic,
causing hypercarbia. Once extubated was placed on CPAP nightly
and 3L 02 via NC . Did not keep last appointment with outpatient
sleep lab. Now set up for close follow up for
sleep and weight management. Patient needs to faithfully use her
CPAP at home and close f/u with sleep physicians.
.
#Acute on chronic blood loss anemia: in the past had acute blood
loss Anemia from gastritis and guaiac positive emesis in the
past thought to be likely Likely [**3-2**] high dose steroids given.
Patient was transfused 1 unit of PRBC on [**2120-12-7**] (prior to
admission), and did not require further transfusion.  Pt was
treated with [**Hospital1 **] ppi, and bleeding appeared to resolve, and H/H
remained stable.
.
# Acute renal failure:
Patient's CR maxed at 2.3, renal failure was possibly secondary
to overdiuresis and bactrim use.  This improved with loosening
of fluid restriction and holding of her lasix and valsartan.
Creatinine on discharge was 1.8.  The patient was instructed to
restart her lasix and valsartan on [**12-19**].
.
# Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure:  Improved. Patient
needs to use CPAP nightly to help prevent exacerbations.

# Hypernatremia:  Resolved with loosening of fluid restriction
and discontinuation of lasix.
.
# Wheezing, mild)  Albuterol
.
# Benign Hypertension: Continued lopressor, clonidine.  Restart
valsartan on [**12-19**].
.
# Panhypopituitarism: Thought to be secondary to "empty sella".
Prednisone 5mg, Levoxyl, and Desmopressin.
.
# UTI: was on bactrim, changed to Cipro and course finished.
.
# FEN: cardiac diet, low sodium, repleate lytes po
