Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5606**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for question of RCA "found down" at OSH on cardiac
catheterization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**4-7**] Cardiac catheterization with placement of BMS to the Left
Circumflex
Removal of Intraaortic balloon pump

History of Present Illness:
65 y.o. with prior cath [**10-11**] with 50% LCx and RCA totally
occluded treated with RCA cypher DES 2.5 x 8 mm, RCA PCI [**2119**],
recently admitted to [**Hospital 46**] Hosp with diastolic heart failure
about a month ago and sent to [**Location (un) 169**] rehab for long stay.
Finally returned home on [**3-30**]. She was home for two days and was
found down by VNA with blood sugar of 490. Per the pt she fell
becasue of feeling dizzy and was only down for a few minutes.
Negative Head CT. She went back to [**Hospital1 46**] and ruled in for small
NSTEMI with a Trop peak of 1.16 and cpk mb of 8.5. She declined
cath initally. Her mental status has been labile, paranoid at
times, and overall questionable.  Her right to consent had been
revoked and her daughter [**Name (NI) 38129**] [**Name (NI) **] consented for cath. BS
today 120's. At cath they first engaged the left and found LCx
with 80% mid lestion. Noted STE in 2, 3 and AVF on EKG. Moved
over to the RCA but not actually engaged and found to be down.
She became bradycardic to the 40's. She did not receive
Atropine. She was started on IV nitro at 60mcg/mn and IV heparin
4000 unit bolus/1400 unit gtt. IABP was placed via 7 french
atrial sheath for ?chest pain. Also has 7 french venous sheath
all on the right.  STE improved. 60cc contrast. Fentanyl and
Versed will be totalled when she leaves their labs. She was
awake and minimally agitated on transfer. Last Lovenox last
evening. BP now improved 140/70.
.
Labs at OSH notable for wbc 5.6, hgb 11.2, hct 32.2, plt 188, na
142, k 3.5 repleted earlier 40meq, cl 106, co2 26, bun 9, cr
0.93 (1.49 prior to hydration), iNR on [**4-2**] 1.02 ptt 23.1.
.
The patient came to [**Hospital1 18**] via Med Flight and went straight to
the cath lab. At this point, she was CP free and EKGs had
settled. Initial access was attempted from rt radial but pt had
spasm so they went in through the left radial initially with
diagnostic catheter which was later switched to PCI catheter.
RCA was found to be widely patent with previous stent in place.
Mid circ 80% lesion was intervened on with BMS. She was
transferred to the floor on heparin gtt and IABP with VSS of HR
60 BP 122/52 satting 99% on RA.

On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. S/he
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

Echo [**2122-4-9**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and
inferolateral hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 40%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation


Brief Hospital Course:
65F w/ prior RCA stent, HTN, IDDM, anxiety disorder who was
flown in from [**Hospital3 **] after suspicion of acute occlusion
of RCA during elective cath for NSTEMI. Underwent cath here and
was found to have patent RCA, but got BMS to 80% LCX. Had
balloon pump removed which was placed at OSH presumably for for
chest pain.
.
#NSTEMI at OSH/CAD/patent at [**Hospital1 18**]: Patient transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] catheterization laboratory after the patient developed
chest pain, bradycardia and STE during diagnostic
catheterization at [**Hospital3 3583**].  During injections of the
LCA, the patient developed chest pain and inferior STE.
Nonselective angiography at that hospital demonstrated occlusion
of the RCA proximally.  An IABP was inserted and she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for confirmatory angiography and possible
PCI of the RCA.  The patient arrived without chest pain.  Pt was
found to have patent RCA in [**Hospital1 18**] unlike report from OSH where
she was thought to have acute occlusion. Given report of
inferior STE changes, pt most likely had transient occlusion of
the RCA resulting from an air or other embolus.  Pt did have 80%
lesion of LCX which was stented with BMS.  Pt had balloon pump
weaned and removed without complication with no subsequent chest
pain or drop in pressure.  Pt should be on Plavix (clopidogrel)
75 mg daily X 1 month uninterrupted and preferably 9 months
total, aspirin indefinitely,and Metoprolol XL 50 mg.
Atorvastatin was also started.
.
# Anxiety/Delirium: Long and significant hx of anxiety, panic
attacks etc. She was started on PRN benzos for severe agitation,
as well as haldol and olanzapine as needed. Psych was consulted,
and felt this was hospital induced delirium. Benzos were weaned
then stopped as were PRN anti-psychotics. She continued on
olanzapine 7.5 qHS with good effect. Her orientation improved to
oriented times three at the time of discharge. However, she
remains intermittently agitated, often worse later in the day,
