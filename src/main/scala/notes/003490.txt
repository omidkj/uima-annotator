CXR ([**3-27**]):  FINDINGS: AP and lateral chest views were obtained
with patient in sitting upright position. The heart size is
normal, and no pulmonary vascular congestion is present. Again
demonstrated is a parenchymal density in the left lower lobe
posterior segment, similar in appearance as described on the
next preceding AP single chest view of [**3-26**]. Additional new
findings consist of some small fluffy poorly identified
parenchymal abnormalities suspected in the lateral portion of
the right upper lobe as well as in the mid left lung field. As
the technical differences of the two studies to be appreciated,
the latter findings are somewhat insecure. Considering, however,
the patient's sepsis status, a followup chest examination with
short interval is recommended.

IMPRESSION: Persistent left lower lobe pneumonic infiltrate,
suspicion for new small disseminated pulmonary parenchymal
densities. Follow up recommended.

Chest CT ([**3-27**]):  IMPRESSION:

1. Ground-glass opacities as well as centrilobular nodules in
the lower lobes, these findings are all consistent with
multifocal atypical infection.

2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.

3. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy as described above may be
reactive.

Followup imaging after treatment is recommended to ensure
resolution of these findings.

Brief Hospital Course:
Sepsis. : On admission, patients symptoms consistent with
sepsis, with hypotension, fever, and tachycardia.  His pressures
were supported with levophed, and patient was admitted to the
MICU.  The etiology of the patient's infection was attributed to
likely pneumonia, given hypoxia, cough, and concerning chest XR.
 He was initially started on vanc/levo, but due to drug induced
hives reaction, patient was switched to vanc/CTX/azithromycin.
Sputum culture grew out MSSA, and patient was switched to
nafcillin then diclocicilian on discharge.  Patients chest XR
showed developing disseminated pulmonary parencymal densities.
A chest CT was obtained, which showed ground glass opacitieis in
RUL and LML c/w multifocal atypical infection.  Given the
patients complaints of shortness of breath and URI type symptoms
in the 2-3 weeks prior to presentation, i is felt that the
patient had an atypical pneumonia then developed a secondary
superinfection with a staph pneumonia.  The patient was
afebrile, had a resolving WBC count, and normal vital signs
prior to discharge.  He was sent home on a twenty-one day course
of diclox as well as azythromycin to complete a 7 day course for
atypical pneumona.  The patient will follow up with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**1-1**] weeks.  Follow up chest XR should be optained to evaluate
for resultuion of disseminated pumonary parencymal densities'
resolution.
.
ARF: The patient with a baseline Cr of 1, which was elevated to
2.6 on admission.  The patient's renal function resolved after
IVF resuscitation.
.
Asplenia: Underwent splenectomy in [**2144**] due to injury in
[**Country **]. Has not had severe infection in the past. Our records
indicate recent pneumo vax, flu shot, but no evidence of H. flu
or meningoccal vaccine.  On follow up with is his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
patient should receivie these vaccinations for encapsulated
organisms.  Additionally, we would recommend consideration of
providing patient with prophylatic antibiotic to take of
immediate health care in not accessible.
.
s/p CVA: Occurred due to traumatic [**Country **] dissection s/p tPA. Had
subsequent anuerysm thought healing related change. Has L
hemiparesis as result. Not on anticoagulation anymore, hypercoag
work up neg
- Monitor clinically
.
Depresion/Anxiety: Continued outpatient Buproprion,
Nortriptyline.
.
Pain syndrome: Diagnosed with a phantom pain syndrome in the
setting of his orchiectomy. Has been seen by pain.  Continued
patients neuronti, oxycodone, nortiptyline, and MS contin.
.
HTN: Patient admitted with hypotension, and anti-hypertensives
were held.  Upon resolution, his outpatient BP meds were
restarted to good effect.
