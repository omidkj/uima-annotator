Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2199-2-8**] Aortic Valve Replacement(21mm Pericardial), Two Vessel
Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(left internal mammary to left
anterior descending artery, vein graft to ramus), and  Aortic
Endarterectomy.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 61512**] is a 82 year old gentleman with symptomatic
coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis.  In [**2198-7-3**],
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] deemed him to be too high risk for surgery due to
extensive aortic calcification. He subequently underwent aortic
valvuloplasty in [**2198-10-3**]. Due to recurrent symptoms, he
underwent repeat cardiac cathterization in [**2199-1-2**] which
revealed left main disease with an instent restenosis of ramus.
Given his severe aortic stenosis and left main lesion, he was
deemed too high risk for percutaneous intervention. He was
subquently referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for off pump CABG, with the
possibility of aortic valve replacement. After extensive
discussion with the patient and his family, he agreed to proceed
with high risk surgery.

[**2199-2-8**] Intraop TEE:
PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus is seen in the
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic root and
ascending aorta have focal calcifications. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic
dissection is seen. A guidewire is seen in the descending aorta
during femoral cannulation.

There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
significant mitral annular calcification. There is prolapse of
the anterior mitral leaflet with a posteriorly directly MR jet
with coanda effect. At least moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen.

POST-CPB:
A bioprosthetic valve is present in the aortic position. The
leaflets appear to move normally. The peak gradient across the
aortic valve is 29mmHg, the mean gradient is 12mmHg. There is a
small paravalvular leak which improved with protamine
administration.

LV systolic function appeared severely depressed immediately
after separation from bypass and slowly improved with
administration of inotropes. Estimated EF after chest closure is
30-35%.

The MR remains an eccentric jet with coanda effect. There is
moderate to severe MR. There is no evidence of aortic
dissection.
.
[**2199-2-15**] Postop Portable TTE:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis
is present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An
eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity
may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 61512**] was admitted and underwent routine preadmission
testing and hemodialysis. On [**2199-2-8**] he was taken to the
operating room and underwent Aortic Valve Replacement(21mm
Pericardial)/Two Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(left
internal mammary to left anterior descending artery, vein graft
to ramus), and  Aortic Endarterectomy. Cardiopulmonary Bypass
time= 245 minutes. Cross Clamp time=180 minutes. Please see
operative note for surgical details. He tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the CVICU intubated and sedated on
multiple pressors and inotropy to optimize cardiac function.
Renal continued to follow postoperatively for his ESRD/dialysis
needs. Mr.[**Known lastname 61512**] was kept intubated to protect his airway
while maintaining stable hemodynamics until POD# 5. Pressors and
inotropy were weaned off. Beta-blockers/Statin/Aspirin and
diuresis was initiated. Postoperative atrial fibrillation was
treated with Amiodarone and beta-blocker. Prolonged conversion
pauses and tachy-brady syndrome became apparant.
Electrophysiology was consulted and a temporary transvenous wire
was placed. Beta-blockade and Amio were held to allow for
recovery. Per EP these agents were slowly reintroduced and
tolerated. Transvenous pacing wire was discontinued on [**2-19**].
Ultimately  a permanent pacemaker was deemed unnecessary.
Anticoagulation was initiated with Coumadin secondary to
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Supratherapeutic INR was treated
with holding anticoagulation, reversal with vitamin K  and fresh
frozen plasma, and gentle dosing with Coumadin was resumed. All
lines and drains were discontinued in a timely fashion.
Antibiotics for Clostridium Difficile was initiated. A Midline
was placed for access.  Speech and swallow was consulted for
swallowing evaluation. POD# 11 he was transferred to the step
down unit for further monitoring. Physical Therapy was consulted
for evaluation of strength and mobility. Hemodialysis was
conducted per Renal. He continued to progress and on POD# 17 he
was cleared for discharge to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation at [**Doctor Last Name 1263**]
for further progress in strength, mobility, and daily
activities.  Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 85178**] to follow Coumadin dosing/INR once Mr
[**Known lastname 61512**] has been discharged from rehab. All follow up
appointments were advised.Target INR 2.0-2.5 for A Fib.
