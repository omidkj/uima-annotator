IMAGING:
[**2146-9-17**] CT Abd/Pelvis: pancreatitis, pseudocysts, SMV
thrombosis
[**2146-9-17**] CTA Pancr Abd/Pelvis: confirmed SMV thrombosis on
venous phase
[**2146-9-27**] Upper GI no oral contrast is seen beyond the duodenal
bulb .
[**2146-10-22**] CXR patchy consolidation of the RUL, bigger R pleural
effusion
[**2146-10-22**] CXR: large R pleural effusion, additional loculated
pleural fluid
[**2146-10-23**] CXR: large focal consolidation in the right lower lobe
with loculated pleural effusion and multiple chest tubes on the
right, no appreciable change since prior study.Small L pleural
effusion
[**2146-10-23**] CXR: Dense opacification of the right hemithorax with
three chest tubes on the right. The loculated right-sided
pleural effusion appears to be somewhat less dense at the right
periphery and there appears to be mildly improved opacification
of the right lung. Dense effusion at the right lung apex and at
the right lung base. Left lung is relatively clear
[**2146-10-24**] CXR: Right loculated pleural effusion is associated
with small amount of air component, difficult to assess in this
single frontal semi-upright view. This is unchanged from prior.
Right chest tubes remain in place. Cardiomediastinal contour is
unchanged. The left lung is grossly clear besides linear
atelectasis in the base.
[**2146-10-25**] CXR: Substantial right pleural effusion, particularly
basal, persist despite presence of three right pleural tubes,
one at the apex, one along the mediastinum and one coiled at the
right base. Attendant atelectasis is persistent, most severe in
the middle and lower lobes. Left lung clear.  Heart size normal.
No endotracheal tube is seen below C7, theupper margin of this
film.
[**2146-10-26**] CXR: The examination is compared to [**2146-10-25**].
The three right-sided chest tubes show an unchanged course and
position. The extent of the lateral pleural opacities have
minimally decreased, the extent of the more medial pleural
opacities are without relevant change. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax. Unchanged blunting of the right costophrenic sinus
suggesting a small pleural effusion. Unchanged opacities along
one of the three chest tubes. The left lung is unremarkable.
[**2146-10-27**] AM CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
position of the right-sided chest tube is unchanged. In the
interval, a minimal decrease of the right pleural fluid has
occurred. The transparency of the right-sided lung parenchyma is
minimally improved. In the left lung, no relevant changes are
seen. No evidence of interval recurrence of focal parenchymal
opacity suggesting pneumonia. No left pleural effusion.
