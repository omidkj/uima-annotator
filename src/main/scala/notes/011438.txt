NOTE:  Day of original admission to Inpatient Psychiatry
Service was [**2163-6-25**]. Transferred to the Medicine Service on
[**2163-7-17**].
Transferred from medicine back to Psychiatry on [**2163-7-21**].  An acute medical decompensation occurred necessitating a
transfer
back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**2163-7-23**].

ADDENDUM:  This is an Addendum to the initial Discharge
Summary dictated on [**2163-7-15**].  Discharge Summary
Addendum as follows.

Ms. [**Known lastname 24542**] was initially admitted to [**Hospital1 **] Four on [**2163-6-25**] and was treated with Risperdal, Celexa, Ritalin, and
Seroquel at different times during her admission.

On [**2163-7-17**] the patient had an acute episode of
dyspnea accompanied by tachycardia, low oxygen saturations
(down to 55%), hypertension, diaphoresis, and cyanosis.  A
respiratory code was called, and the patient was intubated on
[**Hospital1 **] Four and sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  At
that time, she was taking citalopram 40mg (had been taking this
for 3+ weeks), methylphenidate 5mg (x 3-4 days), and risperidone
1mg (x approx one week).

A workup in the Medical Intensive Care Unit did not suggest a
cardiac event or pulmonary embolus.  For further information
on the [**Hospital 228**] Medical Intensive Care Unit admission,
please see the Medical Intensive Care Unit Discharge Summary.
The patient was reportedly extubated in the Medical Intensive
Care Unit on [**2163-7-20**].

While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was
continued on her lorazepam 0.25 mg by mouth three times per
day, as well as her Risperdal 1 mg by mouth q.h.s., and
Risperdal 0.25 mg by mouth twice per day as needed (for
anxiety).  She was also continued on her Celexa 40 mg by
mouth once per day.

The patient's Risperdal was discontinued prior to the
patient's transfer back to [**Hospital1 **] Four on [**2163-7-20**].
At this time, her Ativan 0.25 mg by mouth three times per day
was changed to Ativan 0.25 mg by mouth twice per day.

Ms. [**Known lastname 24542**] was transferred back to the Inpatient Psychiatric
Unit on [**Hospital1 **] Four on [**2163-7-21**] for further treatment
of depression. At the time of
admission, the patient was noted to be very confused with
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] cognition.  Initially, she was unable to
tell the staff her name or where she was, and then she told
the staff that she was "in a foreign country."  At one point,
she seemed to clear a bit and was able to tell the staff the
name of the hospital and the date, but later on did not
recognize her boyfriend of seven years.  This presentation was
inconsistent with any observations made in the three weeks
preceding her transfer to medicine.  She had never been
disoriented or delirious prior to transfer.

On admission to [**Hospital1 **] Four on [**2163-7-21**], the
patient was started on Haldol 0.5 mg to 1 mg by mouth q.3h.
as needed (for agitation related to delirium) as well as
lorazepam 0.25 mg by
mouth twice per day.  She was also continued on her Celexa 40
mg by mouth once per day.

The following day, on [**2163-7-22**], the patient was
started on standing doses of Haldol 0.5 mg by mouth three
times per day.

During the two days of her return to the Inpatient
Psychiatric Unit at [**Hospital1 **] Four, the patient was noted to
be confused with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] consciousness, and waxing
and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] paranoia, in addition to her underlying confusion.
The patient had thoughts about being poisoned with both the
food and the drink, and at times would refuse both her oral
medications and any oral liquid or solid intake.  Paranoia (like
the disorientation) had never been observed on the Psychiatry
service in the three weeks prior to her transfer to medicine.

The patient was noted to remark to the staff that she
believed she was being held in a place that was "pretending
to be a hospital but was actually an experiment in social
justice."  The patient reported her thoughts were cloudy and
that she was having difficulty thinking.

During her brief admission back to the Inpatient Psychiatric
Unit on [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital 24543**] medical consultations were called to
comment on the [**Hospital 228**] medical stabilization, etiology and
treatment of delirium, and any
recommendations regarding her respiratory status.  She was
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Location (un) 1683**] who was covering for the
patient's primary care physician (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1007**]).  The
Medicine Service followed the patient daily from the day of
admission to the day she was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit on [**2163-7-22**].

On the evening of [**2163-7-22**], the patient was noted to
have a period of unresponsiveness with hypotension.  A code
was called, and the patient was again transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.  For further details about the
[**Hospital 228**] Medical Intensive Care Unit admission, please refer
to the Medical Intensive Care Unit notes/chart and Discharge
Summary.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient is now on the Medicine
Service.
