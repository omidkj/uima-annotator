History of Present Illness:
This is a 51-year-old woman with a history of schizophrenia,
lead poisoning, mental retardation, and type 2 diabetes who
presented to the emergency room on [**2156-3-24**] from her group home
with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding.  Per report she had
noted abdominal pain and was found to have blood on her sheets
and in the bathroom from the ngiht prior to admission.  The
patient's last menstrual period was in the begining of [**Month (only) 956**].


On arrival in ED her initial vitals were T 97.1, HR 125, BP
144/73, RR 18, 100%RA.  She was trace guaiac positive on rectal
exam but her abdominal exam was benign.  She was noted to have
wheezing on lung exam and received nebulizers and
methylprednisolone 125 mg IV x 1.  In this setting she became
agitated and resisted nebulizer treatment.  She was unable to
undergo initial CT scan secondary to agitation and subsequently
dropped her oxygen saturations to the 80s on room air which
improved to the 90s on a non-rebreather.  She received 1 mg
lorazepam and 2 mg haloperidol with no improvement in her
agitation and was subsequently intubated for airway protection.
Initial ABG post-inbuation was 7.14/67/383 which improved with
sedation to 7.29/51/187.  She underwent CT torso which reavaled
a possible RUL pneumonia and a 3.7 cm adenexal cyst.  Urine hcg
was negative.  She received a total of 3L IVF.  She was
subsequently admitted to the MICU.

While in the MICU she underwent pelvic [**Month (only) 950**] which showed a
2.8 cm simple left ovarian cyst and trace endometrial fluid.
She was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for community
acquired pneumonia.  She was quickly extubated without
difficulty although she has had persistent tachypnea and
tachycardia without evidence of respiratory distress. She was
noted to have persistent vaginal bleeding which was felt to be
likely secondary to menstruation.  She is being transferred to
the floor for further management.

Currently she has no complaints.  She denies fevers, chills,
night sweats.  No chest pain or difficulty breathing.  No
palpitations.  No nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  No diarrhea
or constipation.  No melena or hematochezia.  She does endorse
vaginal bleeding.  She denies having regular periods and the
bleeding is intermittent.  No other vaginal discharge.  No
dysuria or hematuria.  No leg pain or swelling.  She denies
visual or auditory hallucinations. All other review of systems
is negative in detail.

Imaging:
CXR [**2156-3-24**]: The heart is normal in size. Bilateral hilar
adenopathy is longstanding. Small areas of new opacification in
the lingula and right base could be pneumonia, or lung
involvement of presumed sarcoidosis. There is no pleural
effusion or pneumothorax.

CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**2156-3-24**]:
1. Right upper lobe pneumonia versus sequelae of the patient's
known
sarcoidosis.
2. 6.8 cm left adnexal hypodense structure for which pelvic
[**Month/Day/Year 950**]
evaluation is recommended. Differential diagnosis includes large

adnexal/ovarian cyst, although underlying hydrosalpinx is not
excluded.
Multiple uterine fibroids and prominent endometrium which can
also be
evaluated on the recommended [**Month/Day/Year 950**].
3. 6 mm right breast nodular density; recommend correlation with
mammography.
4. Trace amount of right lower quadrant free fluid of uncertain
clinical
significance.
5. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

Pelvic [**Month/Day/Year **] [**2156-3-24**]: 1. 2.8 cm simple left ovarian cyst
warrants followup to document resolution or improvement.
2. Endometrial fluid, a component of which is likely hemorrhage.


EKG [**2156-3-24**]: sinus tachycardia at 120, normal axis, normal
intervals, no acute ST segment changes, no priors for
comparison.

Microbiology:
Urine culture [**2156-3-24**]: Negative


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 51-year-old woman with history of
schizophrenia, lead poisoning, type II diabetes and hypertension
who presented with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding
subsequently intubated for agitation.

Vaginal Bleeding:  Pelvic [**Month/Day/Year 950**] notable for simple ovarian
cyst and small amount endometrial bleeding.  Patient continues
to have her menstrual periods regularly.  Per her case manager
she had a pap smear and pelvic exam three weeks prior to this
admission which was unremarkable per report.  Her hematocrit
decreased from 38 on admission to 33 although this was in the
setting of IV hydration.  Her hematocrit was subsequently
stable.  She had a pelvic [**Month/Day/Year 950**] which was notable for a
simple ovarian cyst which will require a repeat pelvic
[**Month/Day/Year 950**] in six weeks to confirm resolution.

Hypoxia/Shortness of Breath:  Patient was noted to have hypoxia
in the setting of extreme agitation in the emergency and was
intubated.  She underwent CTA which showed no evidence of
pulmonary embolism but did show evidence of sarcoidosis and a
possible pneumonia.  She was treated initially with levofloxacin
and will complete a course of azithromycin for community
acquired pneumonia.  She also was noted to have wheezing on exam
and was given a short course of inhaled corticosteroids and
bronchodilators. At the time of discharge she was breathing
comfortably on room air.

Anemia:  Patient was noted to have a hematocrit on presentation
in
