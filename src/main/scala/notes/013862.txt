HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 54-year-old
woman with a history of morbid obesity and insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus, who was transferred over from [**Hospital6 **] Hospital for a chief complaint of
fever and lethargy.

This is a 54-year-old, morbidly obese, insulin-dependent
diabetic woman, who was transferred from [**Hospital6 18042**] on [**5-11**] with fever and lethargy for one
week.  She has a history as well of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and asthma, and had been admitted to [**Hospital1 1444**] in [**Month (only) **] and [**2178-5-10**] with pneumonia, at which time the patient was intubated,
failed to wean off the ventilator, and ultimately given a
tracheostomy.  She was discharged to [**Hospital6 18042**] in late [**Month (only) 359**], where she has been since
then.  Her course at [**Hospital6 13846**] had been
notable for multiple urinary tract infections and aspiration
pneumonias, per the report of one of her doctors over there.
She had been treated with multiple courses of antibiotics
and, during this period of time, had had many resistant
organisms grow from her urine and sputum.  Her last urinary
tract infection had grown an organism which was resistant to
most antibiotics, but had been sensitive to imipenem.

Approximately one week prior to admission, the patient
developed fever up to 103 degrees, at which point the patient
was placed empirically on imipenem.  The patient continued to
spike fevers on the imipenem, and therefore her regimen was
broadened to include ampicillin and gentamicin, after which
her fevers continued to spike.  Because of this, her imipenem
was discontinued, and vancomycin and Flagyl were added to her
regimen.  She, in fact, continued to spike through this, and
on the morning of her admission, the patient was switched
empirically to a regimen of linezolid, ceftazidime, and
clindamycin.  As it turns out, on the morning of her
admission, after she was transferred over, report came from
the Microbiology Laboratory at [**Hospital3 672**] that she, in
fact, was growing vancomycin-resistant enterococci in her
urine.

Her JMR course was also notable for the following:
Hypercalcemia of uncertain etiology.  The patient had had an
appropriately-suppressed PTH while at [**Hospital3 672**], but
otherwise had not had a workup for this.  The patient also,
by report, had been profoundly hypothyroid despite large
doses of levothyroxine.  The patient subsequently did become
euthyroid on a dose of 200 mcg once daily.  The patient also
had had very rare suboptimal control of her blood sugar.  At
the time of her transfer over, the patient had been changed
to a regimen of regular insulin sliding scale without a
standing dose.  Her sugars, by report, had been in the 400 to
500 range for several months.  In addition, from a pulmonary
perspective, the patient had been on the ventilator with 20
of pressure support and 5 of PEEP for two months.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, in general, revealed a
morbidly obese, 54-year-old woman who was depressed and
tearful.  Her vital signs were a blood pressure of 110/58,
heart rate 55, respiratory rate on the ventilator was
approximately 22.  Her oxygen saturations on the ventilator
with an FIO2 of 40% were 97%.  Her temperature was 96.5.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Normocephalic,
atraumatic, extraocular movements intact, pupils equal, round
and reactive to light, sclerae anicteric.  The nose had a
nasogastric tube passed through the left nostril, which was a
Dobbhoff tube used for feeding.  The oropharynx was
remarkable for being dry, but was otherwise pink.  The neck
was obese.  Jugular venous pressures were not appreciated.
There was no lymphadenopathy appreciated, and the thyroid was
not felt to be enlarged.  The lungs revealed bilateral coarse
breath sounds without any rubs.  Heart examination revealed
an S1, S2, which was bradycardic but regular, with a II/VI
systolic murmur heard best along the sternal border.  The
abdomen was profoundly obese.  Bowel sounds were present.  It
was nontender to palpation.  The extremities were of
increased bulk, normal tone.  She had 1 to 2+ brawny edema.
In addition, she had a 2 to 3 cm right heel ulcer with a dry
eschar developing in this, no surrounding erythema, and it
appeared to be nontender to palpation.

LABORATORY DATA:   On admission, CBC showed a white count of
15.7, hematocrit 21.8, platelets 335, MCV 81.  Differential
on white count included 69% neutrophils, 9% bands, and 16%
lymphocytes.  Her Chem 7 was a sodium of 150, potassium 3.0,
chloride 117, bicarbonate 21, BUN 41, creatinine 2.0, glucose
439.  Her coags showed a PT of 14.1, PTT of 33.8, INR of 1.4.
She had a calcium of 10.1, magnesium of 1.2, phos of 1.1,
albumin 2.0, free calcium measured at 1.48.
Electrocardiogram was sinus rhythm around 60 with a right
axis deviation.  She had a decreased QRS voltage in the
precordial region, otherwise no significant changes compared
to previous electrocardiograms.  Chest x-ray revealed
bilateral interstitial and some lobular opacities, more dense
toward the bases.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:   The patient was admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for further workup and management
of her fever and lethargy.

1.  Infectious Disease:  The patient was initially continued
on the clindamycin and ceftazidime by the Medical Intensive
Care Unit team.  After initial discussion with the Infectious
Disease consultants, her linezolid was held pending further
investigation into the matter.  The Infectious Disease team,
after reviewing her course over at [**Hospital3 672**], felt that
the VRE in her urine did not represent adequate reason for
temperature spikes up to as high as 103, and recommended
scaling back her antibiotics to include single [**Doctor Last Name 360**]
imipenem.  The patient was maintained on this antibiotic for
the course of her Medical Intensive Care Unit stay.

2.  Cardiovascular:  Given the patient's initial bradycardia
and the question of some decreased QRS voltage in her
precordial region, the patient was cycled for a rule out
myocardial infarction, which she did by enzymes.  In
addition, from a hypertension perspective, the patient was
initially brought back on her dose of Lopressor from 125
twice a day to 25 twice a day given her bradycardia.  This
was eventually increased back up to 50 twice a day at the
time of this dictation.  In addition, the patient's Vasotec
was continued at 40 once daily.  The patient was started on
nifedipine 30 twice a day.

3.  Pulmonary:  The patient's tracheostomy was changed on the
second day of her admission.  She was treated empirically for
pneumonia with the imipenem.  In addition, the patient's
ventilator-dependent status was challenged such that on the
fourth day of her admission, the patient's ventilator
necessity was decreased to simply 5 of pressure support.
There were plans to change her over to trach mask without
assistance of the ventilator.  The results of this will be
added on to this discharge summary prior to her formal
discharge from the hospital.

4.  Renal:  The patient was felt to be profoundly dehydrated.
She was hydrated with both normal saline as well as free
water.  During the first few days of her admission, the
patient was markedly positive in terms of net body fluid
balance.  Her urine output did start to pick up on the third
day of her admission.  It was felt that, just given the large
body habitus, the patient was, in fact, a good 10 to 12
liters down in terms of dehydration.  In addition, the
patient's electrolytes were repleted as necessary, including
of note a phosphate which dropped to a low of .6.  She was
repleted with intravenous phosphate for this, as well as
started on Neutra-Phos three times a day.

5.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient was maintained on tube
feeding regimen.  She had been on ProMod with fiber over at
[**Hospital3 672**], and was initially started on this with free
water boluses, however, the patient did continue to have high
residuals.  The patient was ultimate
