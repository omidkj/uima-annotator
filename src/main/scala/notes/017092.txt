Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
altered MS, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
arterial line placement
lumbar puncture

History of Present Illness:
81M w/ history of recent subdural hematoma s/p right sided
craniotomy/evacuation [**3-30**], chf thought secondary to MR/AR,
afib, aortic aneurysm, now being admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name **] for altered
mental status and hypoxia.
.
Recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] in late [**3-30**] after evaluation for
altered mental status and ultimate discovery of subdural
hematoma w/ subsequent evacuation of hematoma. Per OMR notes,
his mental status was back to baseline at time of discharge.
Also, he was found to have a UTI growing enterobacter and a
possible LLL pneumonia. He was treated with levofloxacin for a
short course.
.
At [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, he was in his USOH until late this morning when
he was noted to be delirious and had O2 sat of 88% on RA. He did
not appear to be in any respiratory distress, and the remainder
of his vitals were stable. He was then referred to the ED for
further evaluation.
.
In the ED, his initial vitals were T 101.2 BP 142/48 HR 85 RR 38
O2 sat 88%RA. He was oriented to self, pupils reactive, but he
was agitated, per ED notes. As pt became more agitated and less
responsive, he was given ativan 2mg iv and vecuronium 10mg iv x1
and intubated for airway protection. CXR taken to verify
position of ED tube revealed possible RML pna, and he was
treated empirically with levo/flagyl and vancomycin. However,
although this AP film was rotated, there was some concern
regarding possible aortic dissection - - he remained
hemodynamically stable, and his CXR was difficult to evaluate.
He also had a head CT w/o contrast to r/o ICH, edema, mass -
this showed residual hypodensity on the R subdural region. U/A
negative, EKG normal. He was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
further management.

Pertinent Results:
CT chest w/o contrast [**5-12**]:
1. CHF with large bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Noncalcified bilateral pulmonary nodules.
3. Right middle lobe consolidation, worrisome for pneumonia.
4. Ascending aorta measures 4.9 x 4.9 cm.
5. Calcified pleural plaques indicative of asbestosis exposure.

CXR AP [**5-12**] (#1):
Endotracheal tube in a standard position. Moderate congestive
heart failure with bilateral pleural effusions.

CT head w/o contrast [**5-12**]:
Persistent small hypodense subdural collection over the right
cerebral hemisphere. No evidence of mass effect, shift of
normally midline structures, or acute hemorrhage.

CXR AP [**5-12**] (#2):
1. ETT at top level of clavicles with room for advancement.
2. Possible right mid lung opacity for which a nonrotated
radiograph would provide further evaluation.

Sputum culture with MRSA sensitive to vancomycin

Brief Hospital Course:
81M w/recent subdural hematoma s/p evacuation in [**3-30**], CHF,
Afib, aortic aneurysm, initially admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for altered
mental status and hypoxia. Found to be fluid overloaded & have
MRSA in sputum. Was intubated in ED, now stable on RA.

# Previous hypoxia: most likely combination of PNA & fluid
overload. BNP >30,000 in ED. Was intubated for tachypnea &
airway protection during agitated state. Diuresed with lasix and
pt was extubated successfully on [**5-16**]. Pt was weaned to room
air with further gentle diuresis.

# CHF: last echo ([**2119-4-3**]) w/EF >55%, 2+ MR, mod AR. Fluid
overloaded at admission as above. No EKG changes, CK-MB flat @
admission w/TropT slightly elevated but stable (likely related
to infection and increase HR).  Remained stable on ACE-I,
Bblocker, and PO lasix 40 daily.

# PNA: seen on CT in right middle lobe. No leukocytosis or high
fevers. Sputum grew MRSA ([**5-12**] & [**5-14**]), sensitive to vanco.
Respir status stable on RA within 24 hours of extubation. Plan
10 day course of vancomycin (started [**2119-5-16**]).

# Pleural effusions: thoracentesis done on [**5-13**] for evaluation
for infectious source revealed transudative fluid (pH 7.4, LDH
100, total protein 1.9), likely from congestive heart failure.

# Mental Status: agitated at admission, most likely related to
infection and acute illness. Also likely continued worsening
baseline dementia. Repeat CT showed small amount of residual
hypodensity over the R hemisphere, but no evidence of acute
hemorrhage. LP on [**2119-5-13**] showed 3 WBC. Apparently also had
recent changes in meds, including higher ritalin dose & starting
xanax. After extubation, pt's mental status remained stable.
Neuro consult followed patient & thought his mental status was
at recent baseline. Did not restart ritalin or Xanax.

# Subdural hematoma: no signif recurrance on head CT. Pt was
continued on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis post-craniotomy but
this was weaned slightly as it can cause agitation. Could
continue to wean by 250 mg q3days if pt becomes agitated. Plan
to continue this medication until neurology or neurosurgical
follow-up.

# AAA: ascending; measured >5cm in [**11-27**] & pt refused surgical
intervention at that time. There was question of widened
mediastinum on CXR in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] but CT chest showed stable size.

# CRI: stable at baseline (creatinine 1.2-1.6)

# Paroxysmal Afib: remained rate-controlled on metoprolol.
Anticoagulation with warfarin was not used given recent subdural
hematoma and h/o frequent falls.

# DM2: remained stable. Pt was covered with RISS. Diabetic diet.

# Elevated LFTs @ admission: resolved. Pt dose have history of
hepatotoxicity due to dilantin. AST elevated at admission, but
remainder of liver enzymes normal. AST normalized within 1 day
of admission. No further S/Sx of liver dz during this
hospitalization.

# Anemia: iron studies most c/w chronic dz (ferritin 86). Hct
stable. Cont ferrous sulfate.
# Hypothyroidism: clinically euthyroid. Synthroid was continued
at home dose.
# Depression: remained stable. Celexa was continued @ home dose.
# FEN: tolerated POs well
# Prophylaxis: maintained on Protonix & pneumoboots
# Communication: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (daughter) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 15217**]
# Code: DNR/I, confirmed with family & ICU team
