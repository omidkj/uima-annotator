Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
C. Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 year-old male with a history of CAD, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia who presents with chest pain. Patient complains
of increased frequency of angina over the last 3-6 months, using
[**3-12**] nitros/week.  However this morning, patient was [**Location (un) 1131**]
paper in bed and developed chest pressure associated with
palpitations, some SOB, and generalized weakness.  No radiation
to arms, jaw, no nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis. No radiation
to back. Took 3 nitros, without relief.  Patient describes it as
his typical anginal pain that wouldn't go away.  Presented to
OSH ED, where pain was relieved with morphine.  Patient has been
pain free since then.

Over the past 3-6 months, patient has had angina on exertion.
Able to climb a flight of stairs without chest pain or pressure.
 But gets symptoms with carrying groceries, or walking more than
1 block.  Pain is always relieved with one nitro. He has been
using [**3-12**] nitros/ week for these symptoms.

Denies symptoms of orthopnea, PND, LE edema. No history of
syncope or palpitations. First time he had palpitations was this
AM with chest pressure.

.
In the ED at OSH, initial vitals were T: 97.8 HR: 81 BP: 192/86
RR: 18 O2Sat: 96%. Patient received nitro paste, Lopressor,
morphine and lovenox, was admitted for further evaluation and
management.

[**8-23**] Cath
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated native artery three vessel coronary artery disease.
 The
LMCA had a 40% lesion.  The LAD was occluded distal to the
touchdown
site of the LIMA with diffuse severe disease.  The LCx was
occluded in
the proximal-mid vessel, and the RCA was occluded proximally.
2. Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated that the LIMA graft
was
patent.  However, as noted above, the LAD was newly occluded
just
distal to the LIMA touchdown.  The SVG-OM and SVG-PDA were both
patent.
The left subclavian stent was imaged and was patent.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics showed moderately elevated left
sided
filling pressure, with LVEDP of 24 mmHg.  The systemic arterial
pressure
was moderately elevated at 151/65 mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel native coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA-LAD, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM with new LAD occlusion
distal to
LIMA touchdown.
3. Moderate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
4. Moderate systemic arterial hypertension.

Repeat Cath [**8-23**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated native three vessel coronary artery disease. The
LMCA had a
30% distla stenosis. The LAD was occluded distal to the LIMA
touchdown,
with collaterals from the RCA. The septal branch had competitive
flow
from the LIMA or RCA collaterals. The mid LCX was occluded. The
ramus
branch was stenosed with systolic flow reversal. THe RCA was not
engaged
as it was known to be occluded.
2. Vein graft angiography demonstrated patient grafts to the RCA
and OM.
3. Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated patient LIMA-LAD
proximally. The distal graft was not well visualized.
4. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated systemic arterial
hypertension with BP of 153/61.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Native three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA-LAD, SVF-PDA, SVG-OM.

Renal US and Dopplers [**8-23**]
IMPRESSION: Symmetric waveforms seen bilaterally at the renal
hilum, with
normal arterial waveforms at the left and right main renal
arteries. Arterial
flow is seen in the renal parenchyma bilaterally, with slightly
diminished
flow in the left side as described.

[**8-24**] TTE
Poor echo windows. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is probably mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). The apex
appears hypokinetic on some views. There is no ventricular
septal defect. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

[**8-24**] Chest X-ray
AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
Patient has had median sternotomy and coronary bypass grafting.
Heart size is top normal. Lungs are clear. No pleural
abnormality.

[**8-24**] Carotid US
IMPRESSION:
1. Right internal carotid artery occlusion as seen previously.
2. Right external carotid artery stenosis greater than 50%.
3. Apparent progression of the left internal carotid artery
stenosis to the 70-79% level, although this stenosis may be
overestimated by the presence of a contralateral occlusion.

[**8-29**] Catheterization
COMMENTS:     1.  Access via left radial artery.
2.  PCI of LAD with 2mm balloon resulting in marginal
improvement.
3.  Angiography of the renals using a 4F multipurpose revealed
two renal
arteries on the right. The dominant upper renal had a 50%
stenosis and
the minor lower pole had 80% stenosis.  We then engaged
selectively two
of the three left renal arteries.  The left upper had 80%
stenosis, the
mid left (dominant) had 30% and the lower left had 30%.
4.  Angiography of the right iliacs revealed moderate 50% iliac
disease
without flow limitation but 90% right CFA lesion that is
calcified
followed by occluded proximal SFA.
5.  Angiography of the left iliacs revealed them to be
