Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**]
Chief Complaint:
Elective aortic valvuloplasty; Right cranial defect.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2148-9-17**]: Aortic valvuloplasty
[**2148-9-19**]: Right cranioplasty on [**2148-9-19**].


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 52932**] is a 56F with h/o critical aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**]
0.5cm2 on [**2148-7-17**]), possible congestive heart failure (LVEF 64%
on [**2148-7-17**]), atrial fibrillation (not on anticoagulation),
resolved mitral valve prolapse, and recent admission for right
intracranial hemorrhage status post right hemicraniectomy and
embolization of right MCA aneurysm who is admitted from an
extended care facility following aortic valvuloplasty.

In brief, she initially presented to [**Hospital6 19155**]
with palpitations on [**2148-7-13**], when she was found to be in rapid
atrial fibrillation (HR 120s), with EKG at that time also
notable for STD in association with mildly elevated Tn and
CK-MB, ultimately attributed to demand ischemia by the OSH. She
received aspirin/clopidogrel, enoxaparin, and IV diltiazem, with
subsequent conversion to sinus rhythm, and was discharged on
aspirin 325mg daily with or without enoxaparin (reportedly
likely without) for thromboprophylaxis. After developing
headache and left facial droop with flaccid paralysis on [**7-16**],
she returned to [**Hospital6 19155**], where noncontrast
head CT revealed right intraparenchymal hemorrhage, and she was
found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation (HR 160s), prompting
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]
[**7-16**], cardiology was consulted for persistent rapid atrial
fibrillation with hemodynamic instability in the setting of
angiogram, and diltiazem drip was initiated, with subsequent
transition to oral diltiazem. Following right decompressive
hemicraniectomy on [**7-17**], TEE revealed critical aortic stenosis
([**Location (un) 109**] 0.5cm2) with preserved LVEF (64%). When she developed
recurrent atrial fibrillation with hemodynamic instability on
[**7-17**] in the setting of repeat angiogram, transient pressors and
amiodarone were initiated, with subsequent conversion to sinus
rhythm on [**7-18**] before planned cardioversion; third attempt at
angiogram with right MCA coiling was successful on [**7-18**]. Hospital
course also was complicated by presumed ventilator-associated
pneumonia, for which she was treated with vancomycin/Zosyn, and
right MCA vasospasm, for which she received intraarterial
verapamil. Diltiazem and nimodipine ultimately were discontinued
and amiodarone decreased to 200mg daily due to soft pressures on
400mg daily. She was discharged on [**8-1**] to an extended care
facility, with subsequent cranioplasty cancelled pending
correction of critical aortic stenosis. She was evaluated by
cardiac surgery on [**9-3**], with valvuloplasty advised in place of
operative intervention, given high-risk surgical candidate.

On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she underwent successful aortic
valvuloplasty without complications. Cardiac catheterization
reportedly demonstrated no significant coronary disease. On
arrival to the floor, she reports sharp frontal headaches in the
setting of the procedure, now resolved, as well as nonradiating
chest pressure that she attributes to anxiety.

Cardiac catheterization ([**2148-9-17**]):
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No significant coronary artery disease.
2. Critical aortic stenosis.
3. Successful balloon aortic valvuloplasty.

Head CT without Contrast ([**2148-9-21**]):
IMPRESSION: Increased edema surrounding the right temporal
hematoma. No other
significant change in appearance of intraparenchymal hemorrhage
after
cranioplasty.

TTE ([**2148-9-17**]):
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There
is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Focused transthoracic examination following aortic
valvuloplasty shows residual moderate to severe aortic stenosis
(mean gradient 40 mmHg) with mild aortic regurgitation. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Portable CXR ([**2148-9-17**]):
In comparison with study of [**7-25**], the cardiac silhouette remains
prominent and there is tortuosity of the aorta.  However, no
evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular congestion or
pleural effusion.  There may be mild atelectatic changes in the
retrocardiac region.
