CXR:
Chronic consolidation and atelectasis in the right middle lobe
have improved.  Upper lungs clear.  No pleural effusion or
evidence of central adenopathy.  Heart size normal.

Abd CT:
1.  Active contrast extravasation in the inferior rectum.  Given
the location, hemorrhoidal bleeding is the most likely cause.
Alternatively, this could represent bleeding from a rectal
artery.
2.  Stable small bilateral pulmonary nodules.
3.  Multiple bilateral renal cysts.
4.  L5 wedge compression deformity.

Flex Sig: Bleeding site was identified approximately 3 cm from
ano-rectal junction. There was a possible Dieulafoy's lesion
that was actively bleeding. The overlying clot was removed.
Blood in the rectum, sigmoid colon and descending colon
Bleeding possibly secondary to Dieulafoy's lesion. Hemostasis
was successful.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo Man with PMH sig for afib on coumadin
COPD, hx of CVA and PUD who presented to the ED with BRBPR, was
transferred to the MICU and seen by GI s/p Flex sig with
bleeding ulcer which was electrocauterized and s/p epinephrine
injection. His bleeding resolved, and his Hct stablized. He was
able to tolerate PO and had no further BRBPR, melena or
abdominal pain at discharge. His Coumadin was not restarted. It
was left to his PCP to reevaluate risk and benefits of coumadin
vs bleed. His lowest Hct was 21 for which he received 2 units of
PRBCs. He was discharged on hospital day number 4 with Hct of 31
and asymtomatic with ambulation. He was continued on all outpt
meds, cautioned about NSAID use and no Coumadin.
