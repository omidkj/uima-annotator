Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 98018**] is a 79 y/o female with a history of MMP including
diabetes, HTN, depression, who had undergone a right
ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy on [**2198-7-24**] with
post-operative course complicated by STEMI and PE.

Active Issues This Admission:

# Right ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy on [**2198-7-24**]: Pt
originally admitted for elective urologic laser lithotripsy and
stent due to recurrent renal stones. The procedure had no
complications and stones were removed. Urology followed patient
while she was here. Stents were left in for now and she will f/u
with urology in about a week.

# Fever. [**Name (NI) 1917**] pt spiked to 101. Pt had a postive UA
but culture with NGTD. Blood cultures NGTD. Uncertain if fever
[**2-1**] to instrumentation. Patient is incontinent at baseline which
puts her at higher risk for infection. Patient completed course
of cipro for potential UTI. She remained afebrile throughout
remaineder of adission.

# Pulmomary Emboli.
On POD #3, overnight the patient felt like her heart was
"racing", but was without pain or SOB, with increased systolic
blood pressures to 150s and tachycardia to 110s.  A stat EKG was
obtained which revealed sinus tachycardia.  She is on her home
dose of metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **], and losartan was discontinued.
Her WBC increased to 17.3.  A repeat CXR again revealed no
pneumonia. Patient became progressively hypoxic and CTA showed
PE. She was started on a heparin and transitioned to coumadin.
Hypoxia subsequently improved. Her INR was 2.4 on day of
discharge and INR should be checked again on [**8-3**].

Transfer to Medcine:
It was determined that the patient has multiple comorbidities in
the setting of acute hypoxia and will be transfered to the
medicine service on [**2198-7-26**].

# STEMI: Following transfer patient continued to complain of
chest flutteri
