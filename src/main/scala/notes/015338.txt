CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Patient is a 76-year-old gentleman with
known autoimmune hepatitis, who presented to the [**Hospital1 346**] with acute onset abdominal pain
ultimately leading to a colonic resection for ischemic gut.

1. Coronary artery disease.
2. Hypercholesterol.
3. COPD.
4. Hypertension.
5. Left carotid occlusion.
6. Gastritis.
7. Non-insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus.
8. Raynaud's.
9. Autoimmune hepatitis.
10. Cholelithiasis.
11. Idiopathic pleural effusions.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:

2. Atenolol 50 mg q.d.
3. Lipitor 20 mg q.d.
4. Atrovent two q.d.
5. Coumadin two q.d.
6. Citrucel q.d.
7. Multivitamin.
8. Protonix 40 q.d.
9. Actigall 250 b.i.d.
10. Prednisone 40 mg q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  In the [**Hospital1 **] Emergency Department, patient's vital signs were a
temperature of 97.4, pulse 78, blood pressure 181/98,
respirations 20, and sating 97% on room air.

White blood cell count was 11.2, hematocrit 48.8, platelets
181.  PT 12.0, INR 1.0, PTT 20.7.  Sodium 141, potassium 3.3,
chloride 98, CO2 32, BUN 31, creatinine 1.6, and a glucose of
283.  AL7 176, AST 21, amylase 71, alkaline phosphatase 165,
total bilirubin 1.2.

KUB on admission showed colonic distention and stool and air
in the rectum distal colon.

CLINICAL COURSE:  This patient originally presented on
[**2186-6-8**] with an approximately six week history of
pruritus, 12 pound unintentional weight loss, dark urine, and
light stools.   At that time, he was noted to have increased
LFTs, so ERCP was performed on [**2186-6-23**].  No obstruction or
lesion was found, although a stent was placed ultimately
leading to no relief.

Subsequent workup by GI Hepatology showed that the patient
had autoimmune hepatitis, and liver biopsy was found to be
consistent with this.  Patient was then started on prednisone
with relief of symptoms.  On the Friday prior to admission,
the patient had his stent removed.  The following morning at
approximately 3 a.m., the patient awoke constipated with
diffuse [**9-15**] abdominal pain radiating to the back, steady,
but not crampy.  There is no change in the pain, intensity,
or quality based on position, eating, or activity.  There was
associated nausea and vomiting during the entire morning and
following day.

CT scan performed that morning showed uniformly dilated colon
with air in the colon wall (pneumatosis).  Air was also seen
in the portal system and small amount of air tracking along
the colon wall.  Based on the these results, the patient was
started immediately on IV antibiotics, and transferred to the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  From the Intensive Care Unit,
the patient underwent a right hemicolectomy, with creation of
a diverting ileostomy and mucus fistula.  Following the
surgery on the [**2186-8-15**], patient returned to the Intensive
Care Unit and was paced on the ventilator for respiratory
support.

On postoperative day three, on [**2186-8-17**], the patient was
successfully extubated and his supportive requirements were
gradually decreased.  On [**2186-8-18**], the patient was
transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to a normal patient
care floor.

On the floor, he continued to progress well with bowel
function gradually returning over the next several days.  On
[**2186-8-19**], his diet was advanced from sips to clear liquids
to full liquids and ultimately soft foods.  He tolerated all
of this without problem or episode.  Following a Physical
Therapy consult and evaluate on [**2186-8-21**] and conferring
with the attending surgeon, it was felt that the patient was
a suitable candidate for discharge.

Prior to his departure, he completed full training with both
the wound care nurse and the ostomy nurse at the [**Hospital1 **].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  On discharge, patient is stable,
tolerating full p.o.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient is discharged to home with
visiting nursing.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Status post hemicolectomy for ischemic bowel.
2. Autoimmune hepatitis.
3. Coronary artery disease.
4. Hypercholesterol.
5. COPD.
6. Hypertension.
7. Left carotid occlusion.
8. Gastritis.
9. Non-insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus.
10. Raynaud's.
11. Autoimmune hepatitis.
12. Cholelithiasis.
13. Idiopathic pleural effusions.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Aspirin.
2. Atenolol 50 mg q.d.
3. Lipitor 20 mg q.d.
4. Atrovent two q.d.
5. Coumadin two q.d.
6. Citrucel q.d.
7. Multivitamin.
8. Protonix 40 q.d.
9. Actigall 250 b.i.d.
10. Prednisone 40 mg q.d.
11. Levofloxacin 500 mg q.d. x6 days.
12. Flagyl 500 mg t.i.d. also for six days.

FOLLOWUP:  The patient is scheduled to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
clinic on Thursday, [**8-31**].  He has an occlusion
clamp in place over his mucus fistula.  This will most likely
fall off on its own by the time of discharge and his clinic
appointment, and he is instructed to bring this with him to
the clinic when he sees Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
