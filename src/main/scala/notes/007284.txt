mm left lower lobe superior segment nodule. Follow up in one
year's time is recommended for further evaluation. 2. Focal
irregularity in the superior left main stem bronchus is likely
inflammatory. Attention to this area should be paid on
subsequent follow-up exams. 3. 17 x 1mm left adrenal lesion.

evaluation with dedicated CT or MRI would be required to secure
that interpretation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 71663**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2115-3-22**] for surgical
management of his coronary artery disease. He was worked-up in
the usual preoperative manner including vein mapping and
pulmonary function testing. (Reports currently unavailable) A
Chest CT scan was performed which showed a 5 mm left upper lobe
subpleural nodule and 2 mm left lower lobe superior segment
nodule for which follow up in one year's time is recommended for
further evaluation. A focal irregularity in the superior left
main stem bronchus was seem which was likely inflammatory and a
17 x 1mm left adrenal lesion. While this statistically
represents an adenoma, further evaluation with dedicated CT or
MRI would be required to secure that interpretation. On [**2115-3-26**],
Mr. [**Known lastname 71663**] was taken to the operating room where he underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels. Postoperatively
he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. On postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 71663**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**]
neurologically intact and was extubated. Toradol was given for
pain. Beta blockade, a Statin and aspirin were resumed. He was
then transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. He
was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. Chest tubes and epicardial
pacing wires were removed per protocol. On post-op day four he
was started on antibiotics for sternal drainage. The remainder
of his hospital course was uneventful and he was discharged home
with VNA services on post-op day seven. He will follow-up in one
week for wound check as at outpatient clinic.
