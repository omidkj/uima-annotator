some CP pain and sob. He took ntg with resolution of CP, however
the sob got progressively worse. He felt that he had a "lack of

75bpm, borderline left axis, q waves V1-V3 and III and avF, t
wave inversion avL, no other ST/T changes. He was given 20mg IV
lasix. Most recent vitals prior to transfer:

On arrival to the floor, patient was seen with the nurse who

IMAGING:
CXR [**2175-1-29**]
FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.
Low lung
volumes limit evaluation. There are bilateral pulmonary
opacities which are most confluent in the lung bases. Central
pulmonary hilar engorgement with interstitial and alveolar edema
is present. Bilateral pleural effusions are small to moderate.
No pneumothorax. Heart size appears enlarged though poorly
assessed. Mediastinal contour is stable with atherosclerotic
calcification along the aortic knob. Bony structures are intact.

IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with pulmonary edema/heart
failure.
Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions also present.
.
CXR: [**2175-2-2**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a
decrease in
extent of the bilateral pleural effusions. Sequence decrease in
severity of the basal areas of atelectasis. Unchanged moderate
cardiomegaly, currently without evidence of pulmonary edema.
.
KUB [**2175-2-4**]
ABDOMEN, SUPINE
The distribution of gas in the abdomen is unremarkable. No
edematous areas of bowel are seen. There is no evidence of
obstruction or infarction. Vascular calcification is noted.
.
EKG on admission [**2175-1-29**]: Rate 133, atrial fibrillation with
RVR, occasional PVCs, normal/borderline left axis deviation., LV
hyprtrophy.  normal rhythm, normal/borderline left axis, Q waves
in III, V2-V4. ST segments depressed in I, AVL, V6 but unchaged
from prior EKG.
