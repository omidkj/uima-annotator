Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Exertional dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization, stent placement in Left Anterior
Descending Coronary Artery.


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 47 yo obese man with HTN, HPLD, smoking admitted to
[**Hospital1 139**] on [**12-22**] with new onset CHF, now admitted to the CCU
following acute STEMI on the floor now s/p cath, thrombectomy
and DES stentx2 of 100% occlusion of LAD.
Pt was admitted after several months of progressive dyspnea and
exertional chest pain (from unlimited ET to dyspnea at rest pta)
as well as orthopnea and PND. Pt was ruled out for MI on
admission with negative cardiac enzymes and EKG and started on
O2, lisinopril and lasix for presumed CHF, with resolution of
sx.  On the night of [**12-25**] pt began to feel mild epigastric CP
but had negative cardiac enzymes and an unchanged EKG. TTE the
following morning showed decreased LV WMA and diastolic
dysfunction. At approximately 12pm on [**12-26**], the pt had severe
epigastric CP radiating to his jaw accompanied by dyspnea,
nausea and diaphoresis. EKG showed ST elevations in I, VL,
V3-V6. Pt was taken to the cath lab, with cath showing 3 vessel
disease and 100% occlusion of mid-LAD. Thrombectomy and DESx2
placement restored flow and relieved sx. Pt tolerated the
procedure well and arrived in the CCU with stable vital signs
and mild cp.

.
EKG: NSR, left axis deviation with LVH
.
CXR:
1. Kerley B lines in the lower lobes without evidence of cardiac
enlargement may represent acute cardiac decompensation. Clinical
correlation is recommended.
2. Pleural thickening along the right lateral chest wall and the
horizontal fissure with no evidence of focal pulmonary
consolidations.
.
ECHO ([**12-26**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with focal akinesis of the basal inferior
wall and entire inferolateral wall. The remaining segments
contract normally. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). Transmitral Doppler and tissue
velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV
diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild ventricular
hypertrophy with moderately dilated left ventricle and regional
left ventricular systolic function consistent with coronary
disease. Moderate diastolic dysfunction. Mild pulmonary
hypertension.
.
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION ([**12-26**])
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed three vessel disease. The LMCA was widely patent. The
LAD was totally occluded in the mid-vessel. The LCx had a 80%
stenosis in the OM1 branch. The RCA was diffusely diseased with
a 70% lesion in the mid-vessel.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a severely elevated
LVEDP at 30mmHg. There was mild systemic arterial hypertension
with a central aortic pressure of 148/86mmHg.
3. Successful thrombectomy and stenting of the mid LAD with a
2.75 x 23 mm and a 2.5 x 8 mm XIENCE DES. The stents were post
dilated with a 2.5 x 20 mm quantum maverick balloon at 16 ATM
twice. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the
stent, no dissection and normal flow. (See PTCA comments)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Successful stenting of the mid LAD

Brief Hospital Course:
47 yo w HTN, HPLD admitted to the floor for CHF and subsequently
admitted to CCU for acute STEMI s/p stent of 100% LAD occlusion.
.
DYSPNEA: Patient presented with shortness of breath with
exertion.  He diuresed well with lasix 20 mg PO and was started
on beta blocker, aspairn, and ACE therapy.
.
ST-ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION:  Patient had a STEMI with a
100% mid LAD occluion and 3VD.  He had a successful PCI and
stent placement and remained hemodynamically stable.  He was
treated with asparin, Plavix (12months), statin, ACE, beta
blocker, integrillin.  His CK peaked at 51 on [**12-26**].  He had an
EF of 40-45% prior to his MI and no signs of failure post MI.
He was discharged on medical management for coronary artery
disease.
- He should have a follow up Echo to assess cardiac function.
- Also needs follow-up stress test to eval for residual
deficits.
.
HYPERTENSION: Controlled on Metoprolol and Lisinopril.
.
HYPERLIPIDEMIA:
