Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**]
Chief Complaint:
Right middle lobe mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2165-1-15**]: Flexible bronchoscopy, cervical mediastinoscopy, right
VATS middle lobectomy.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of an
enlarging right middle lobe mass. Past scan had shown the mass
to be positive. As such, after discussion with the patient, we
decided to proceed with a right middle lobectomy. It was thought
that this could be approached via VAT. The patient had
preoperative testing which confirmed that she would have enough
pulmonary reserve to tolerate a right middle lobectomy.

Past Medical History:
COPD, hypertension, junctional bradycardia/syncope, arthritis,
anxiety, depression

Social History:
Divorced with 10 children.  Previously worked in the cafeteria
in [**Hospital6 17032**].  Quit smoking 10 years ago.
Does not drink at present .  She has a history of alcohol usage
in the past.


Family History:
Has a family history of cancer

Physical Exam:
VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure is 130/70, heart rate is 80, sats
93, 5 feet 4, and 176 pounds.
NECK:  JVP 7 cm, carotids without bruits.
LUNGS:  Diminished at both bases.  No wheezes noted, dry
crackles.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm, good S1 and S2, without murmurs
or rubs, question of a right carotid bruit.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, without pulsatile masses or
hepatosplenomegaly.
EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Pulses are 1+
distally.

***** [**2165-1-15**] CHEST XRAY
Reason: eval for effusion, pneumo/hemothorax

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
71 year old woman with COPD s/p R middle lobectomy, acute desats
and SOB
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for effusion, pneumo/hemothorax
HISTORY: COPD with decreasing saturation and previous surgery.

In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the left
hemidiaphragm is quite well seen with only minimal atelectatic
changes at this and the other base. Right chest tube remains in
place, and there is no definite pneumothorax. Mild atelectatic
changes persist at the left base. There is some vague haziness
with preservation of markings at the right base. This could
possibly represent some pleural fluid, although the sharpness of
the hemidiaphragm makes this less likely. A lateral view would
be most helpful for further evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 39008**] underwent uncomplicated right middle lobectomy on
[**2165-1-15**].  Please see operative report for full details of the
operation.  Postoperatively she had some borderline ABGs in the
PACU, which improved with pulmonary toilet and decreased
narcotics, and was transferred to the floor.  That evening she
was found to be acutely hypoxic and short of breath, with a low
pO2 by ABG, so was started on a nonrebreather mask and
transferred to the ICU.  She did well there and was weaned to
nasal cannula by the next day.  She was transferred back to the
floor, where she was ambulating well and advanced to regular
diet.  Her chest tube was pulled on POD 2 and there was no
pneumothorax on a post-pull chest Xray.  She did require low
flow O2 per nasal cannula to keep her O2 sat above 90,
especially while ambulating.  On POD 4 she complained of some
nausea associated with her narcotics so her Percocet was
discontinued and she was started on standing Tylenol.
