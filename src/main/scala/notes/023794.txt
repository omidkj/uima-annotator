LGIB, radiation proctitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
flexible sigmoidoscopy

History of Present Illness:
67 y/o F w/ hx of CAD and radiation proctitis (s/p XRT 02 and 03
for uterine CA).  Pt presented with BRBPR.  She is s/p argon
laser tx 3 wks ago ([**Date range (1) 41988**]).  Pt was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for another argon laser treatment 12/08-15/04 due to
recurrent bleeding.  Bleeding recurred [**12-21**] when she had three
profuse episodes and went to [**Location (un) **] where her Hct was seen to
drop from 34 to 28.5.  She was subsequently transferred back to
[**Hospital1 18**] where she complained of lightheadedness and sob on
admission and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
FLex sig showed abnormal vascularity in the rectum compatible
with radiation proctitis and a clip was placed and cauterization
performed.

##########################################
PORTABLE CHEST: Comparison is made to prior study dated
[**2136-12-2**]. The current study is limited by significant patient
rotation. Changes of prior median sternotomy are again noted. A
dual-chamber transvenous cardiac pacer is without change. The
cardiac and mediastinal contours are not well evaluated, but
appear grossly unchanged. Evaluation of the lung parenchyma is
also limted. Diffuse indistinctness of vessel and hilar outlines
may reflect mild CHF. Relative haziness of the hemithorax may be
an artifact of rotation. No frank air-space infiltrate is seen.
IMPRESSION: Limited study; cannot rule out mild CHF.
##########################################
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is pleural
thickening identified at bilateral lung bases. There are
scattered pleural calcifications seen. The patient is status
post cholecystectomy. The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal
glands are unremarkable. There is a focal area within the mid
pole of the right kidney without cortical enhancement, which
likely represents an aread of prior infarction or inflammation.
The kidneys are otherwise unremarkable.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no free air, fluid,
or significant lymphadenopathy within the pelvis. There is
atherosclerotic disease within the aorta and iliac vessels with
wall calcifications. Note is made of diffuse, circumferential
thickening of the rectum and sigmoid colon consistent with the
patient's history of radiation proctitis/colitis. There is also
thickening of the bladder wall. The rest of the bowel loops are
unremarkable.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
lesions.
IMPRESSION:
1) No abnormal masses or lymphadenopathy in the abdomen and
pelvis to indicate metastatic disease.
2) Bibasilar pleural thickening with pleural calcifications seen
on limited views of the lungs consistent with asbestos exposure.
3) Circumferential wall thickening of the rectum and sigmoid
colon consistent with the patient's history of radiation. There
is also bladder wall thickening.

Brief Hospital Course:
ANEMIA:  Pt was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hemodynamic control.
 She received 1 unit of PRBCs for a Hct drop from 31 to 27.  Her
Hct remained stable throughout the rest of her hospitalization.

.
PROCTITIS:  Pt now with multiple episodes of BRBPR secondary to
proctitis.  A non-emergent diverting colectomy is recommended.
.
CHF:  not an active issue on this admission
.
HTN:  managed well on current regimen
.
DM:  FSG and ISS, controlled throughout hospitalization
.
ARF:  Cr 1.2 to 1.7, possibly secondary to prerenal, Pt was
hydrated, but insisted on leaving.  Will have PCP measure Cr and
suggest rehospitalization if increasing Cr.
