HISTORY:  Baby boy [**Known lastname **] twin #1, [**Known lastname 76990**], was born to a 25-year-
old mother, [**Name (NI) 44306**] P2 with the following prenatal labs: Blood type A
positive, antibody negative, RPR nonreactive. Hepatitis B
surface antigen negative. Rubella immune. GBS was unknown at
the time of delivery. Mom had [**Name2 (NI) 76170**] preterm labor that
began on [**2159-11-15**]. The mom did receive betamethasone
and antibiotics prior to delivery. Mom was transferred from
[**Hospital3 **] to [**Hospital1 69**]
for delivery of these premature diamniotic monochorionic
twins. One of the twins was a footling breech and a C section
was performed for that indication. The twins were born at 25
weeks gestation as previously mentioned. This twin, [**Known lastname 76990**]
[**Known lastname **], twin #1, emerged vigorous and required intubation in
the delivery room with a 2.5 endotracheal tube. Apgars were 5
and 7. [**Known lastname 76990**] was transferred to the NICU for further
care. Birth weight was 770 grams which is equivalent to 25-50
percentile. Birth length was 28 cm which was equal to less than
10th percentile. His head circumference at birth was 23.5 cm
which was equal to the 25-50 percentile.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  [**Known lastname 76990**] is beign discharged on
[**2160-3-13**] which is corrected to 40-4/7 postmenstural weeks
gestation at day of life 109. Birth weight on discharge was
3.330 kilos which is equivalent to the 50-75 percentile for
corrected gestational age.  His length upon discharge is 47.5
cm which is equal to the [**9-20**] percentile. His head
circumference on discharge was 36.0 cm which is equal to the
50th percentile for corrected gestational age. Generally,
[**Known lastname 76990**] is alert and active on exam. He does have generalized
erythema that is most significant to the neck and lower facial
area as well as the groin. HEENT exam is negative for anterior
fontanel that is open, soft and flat and approximated sutures.
Ears are normal set and rotation.Palate is high arched. No other
dysmorphic facies noted. Neck is supple. Respiratory exam reveals
coarse breath sounds bilaterally with good aeration. He does have
mild nasal congestion and nasal cannula is in place
at the time of exam. Cardiovascular: The patient has a normal
S1, S2 with a soft intermittent systolic murmur heard best at
the left sternal border with equal femoral pulses bilaterally.
The abdominal exam is without distention and no tenderness. There
are no masses palpated on the abdomen. The GU exam is significant
for bilateral linear 2 cm surgical scars proximal to the scrotal
sac. [**Known lastname 76990**] does have bilateral hydroceles and testes are
descended bilaterally. [**Known lastname 76990**] has a PlastiBell in place over the
penis. The skin is starting to separate from the
string along the PlastiBell and appears intact with no
significant erythema or pus. The extremities are warm and
well perfused. There is mottling to the distal extremities at
baseline. Neuro exam is significant for a normal suck for
his gestational age and a positive Moro reflex with normal tone.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory: [**Known lastname 76990**] initially had surfactant
defieicny.  He was initially placed on high frequency ventilation
and remained on high frequency ventilation from birth until day
of life 32. He also received surfactant at birth. [**Known lastname 76990**] was
transitioned to a conventional ventilation from
day of life 32 until day of life 51. He remained on
CPAP from day of life 51 until day of life 66. He was then placed
on nasal cannula from day of life 66 until
discharge with a diagnosis of chronic lung disease.
He did receive a two week course of dexamethasone
which began on day of life 29. The parents were consulted
regarding the associated poor neurologic sequela that can be
associated with dexamethasone. [**Known lastname 76990**] also received
vitamin A as a preventative measure to chronic lung disease
and was placed on chronic diuretics and will be
discharged home on these diuretics. At discharge, his
respiratory status includes nasal cannula at 250 cc
as well as Lasix 2 mg/kilo/day on Monday, Wednesday and
[**Known lastname 2974**]. He also is receiving potassium chloride supplementation.

[**Known lastname 76990**] had apnea of prematurity and was started on caffeine in
the initial stages of this hospitalization. The caffeine was
discontinued at day of life 79 which was equivalent to 36-2/7
weeks gestation. He has not had any significant apnea events for
several weeks prior to discharge.

Cardiovascular: [**Known lastname 76990**] did have a patent ductus arteriosis and
was treated with two courses of Indomethacin.  He had very small,
only intermittently open patent ductus arteriosus on [**2159-12-18**]. Also, echocardiogram revealed normal
structure and normal biventricular function of the heart. [**Known lastname 76990**]
does have a baseline systolic murmur which is thought to be a
peripheral pulmonic stenosis murmur. He did not receive any
cardiovascular pressors for hypotension during this
hospitalization.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition: [**Known lastname 76990**] was initially given
parenteral nutrition via central venous line. Low dose feedings
were initiated on day of life 10 and was receiving full feedings
by day of life 18. He received breast milk as well as formula
during his hospitalization and will be discharged home on Enfamil
24 kcal per ounce formula ad lib.  He has been receiving 24
calories since [**3-3**] with slow and steady weight gain.  His most
recent set of electrolytes was on [**3-10**] with Na=143, K=5.4, cl=109
and HCO3=24.

Hematologic: [**Known lastname 76990**] did receive several blood transfusions in the
first 1-2 weeks of life for low hematocrits related to blood
draws. He had indirect hyperbilirubinemia and was treated with
phototherapy.  His last hematocrit was on [**3-4**] with value of 29.3%
and reticulocyte count of 4.2%.

Infectious disease: [**Known lastname 76990**] initially received ampicillin and
gentamicin for 48 hour rule out sepsis workup at birth. He also
received vancomycin and cefotaxime for a presumed sepsis and
meningitis for a 21 day course. He initially was started on
vancomycin and cefotaxime related to clinical symptoms of sepsis
for a 7 day course. Near the end of that 7 day course on [**2159-12-10**], a lumbar puncture was performed. This lumbar puncture
had a significant number of white blood cells and red blood
cells. It was felt that the substantial increase in white
blood cells was concerning for a meningitis and the patient
was treated for a full 21 day course. No positive culture
results from the blood or CSF were obtained during this
hospitalization.

Neurologic: [**Known lastname 76990**] was started on a fentanyl drip for sedation
while being ventilated with high frequency ventilation. His
fentanyl drip was weaned and he transitioned to oral neonatal
morphine. This dose was weaned slowly during his hospitalization
and was discontinued several weeks prior to discharge. He was
followed closely for intraventricular hemorrhage during the first
few weeks of life. Initial head ultrasounds in the first week of
life were reportedly normal. On day of life 30 at scheduled
routine head ultrasound, [**Known lastname 76990**] had a right ventricular
hemorrhage and ventriculomegaly. Throughout the month of
[**Month (only) 956**], he was closely followed for increasing
ventriculomegaly. Resistive indices were checked every 2-4
days. He did have worsening ventriculomegaly related to
intraventricular hemorrhage consistent with posthemorrhagic
hydrocephalus. [**Known lastname 76990**] did have serial lumbar punctures to remove
fluid which took place on [**2067-1-9**], 16, 21, 23, and 24.
Head circumferences were also followed extremely closely during
this critical time. Throughout [**Month (only) 958**] and early [**Month (only) 547**], head
ultrasounds showed evolving hemorrhage and st
