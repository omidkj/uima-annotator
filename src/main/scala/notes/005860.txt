Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84-year-old
female with a known history of coronary artery disease,
status post a myocardial infarction twelve years ago, who
presented to the Emergency Department with chest pain.

The patient reported that her chest pain developed last
evening when she was at rest.  She took three sublingual
nitroglycerin tablets with subsequent resolution of her chest
pain; however, her chest pain returned later in the evening,
and she presented to the Emergency Department.

Upon presentation to [**Hospital6 33**] Emergency
Department, the patient was given sublingual nitroglycerin as
well as Lovenox 60 mg at 9 p.m., aspirin, and morphine.

The patient subsequently had recurrence of her chest pain at
approximately 2 a.m. and was noted to have ST depressions in
V4 through V6, II, III, and aVF.  Her initial laboratories
were borderline positive with a troponin of 0.16, creatine
kinase of 159, and MB positive at 32.  Therefore, she was
transferred from [**Hospital6 33**] to the [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Department.

In the Emergency Department, a Cardiology consultation was
obtained, and the patient was complaining of [**4-16**] chest pain
which resolved with administration of morphine.  The patient
was noted to have a borderline blood pressure of
approximately 90 systolic and was treated with 500 cc of
normal saline bolus.  A 2B3A inhibitor was not given because
the patient had a hematocrit of 28 and was noted to be
guaiac-positive on physical examination.  The patient also
reported bright red blood per rectum, presumed to be her
hemorrhoids, for approximately one week prior to admission.

A repeat electrocardiogram obtained upon arrival showed some
improvement in her ST depressions.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems was positive for
longstanding lightheadedness which is worse in the morning
and relieved by lying down.  The patient denied any current
shortness of [**Last Name (LF) 1440**], [**First Name3 (LF) 691**] radiation of her chest pain, or any
associated nausea or vomiting.  The patient reported never
having chest pain similar to this prior to this episode.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction twelve years ago.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Diabetes.
4.  History of transient ischemic attack four years ago with
binocular blindness.
5.  Status post cholecystectomy.
6.  History of large subdural hematoma ten years ago, status

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies, but
reports that ASPIRIN upsets her stomach.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION: Aggrenox (dipyridamole 200 and 25)
1 tablet p.o. q.d., insulin 24 units subcutaneous q.d.,

irbesartan 150/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 1 tablet p.o. q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient denied any tobacco or alcohol
use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed
afebrile, blood pressure of 95/50, pulse of 80, satting 99%
on 4 liters nasal cannula.  In general, comfortable, in no
acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat revealed
mildly dry mucous membranes.  Jugular venous distention at
11 cm.  Cardiovascular revealed a regular rate and rhythm.
No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs revealed occasional
wheezes bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities revealed no
edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses.
Rectal revealed guaiac-positive brown stool.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory values
revealed a white blood cell count of 12.8, hematocrit
of 26.3, platelets of 302.  Sodium of 142, potassium of 3.9,
chloride of 108, bicarbonate of 24, blood urea nitrogen
of 21, creatinine of 1.1, glucose of 155.  PTT of 36.3, PT
of 17.4, INR of 1.2.  Creatine kinase of 281, MB of 59, with
an index of 21.  Calcium of 7.8, magnesium of 1.6,
phosphorous of 2.7.  Albumin of 2.9.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus
rhythm at 89 beats per minute, Q waves in V1 through V3, 1-mm
ST elevations in V4 through V6, ST depressions in I, II, and
aVR, and aVL.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is an 84-year-old female with
known coronary artery disease who presented with unstable
angina who is now chest pain free status post nitroglycerin
drip and heparin with no subsequent administration of a 2B3A
inhibitor given her recent bright red blood per rectum and
hematocrit of 26.

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was continued on her
nitroglycerin drip as well as heparin drip and started on a
low-dose beta blocker.  Her aspirin was continued; however,
her Aggrenox was discontinued, and the patient was treated
with 1 unit of packed red blood cells given her low
hematocrit.  Her blood pressure was monitored closely;
however, the patient did not require any further boluses to
maintain her blood pressure.

The patient was sent to catheterization later in the day
which revealed 3-vessel disease with total occasional of the
left circumflex, 90% left anterior descending artery which
was stented, 80% middle right coronary artery which was
stented and which was felt to be the culprit lesion.  Her
pulmonary artery saturation was noted to be 40%, with a wedge
of 36.  Therefore, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed.
The patient was diuresed with 60 mg of Lasix in the
catheterization laboratory and sent to the Coronary Care
Unit.

Upon arrival in the Coronary Care Unit, the patient was
stable without any complaints of further chest pain.

Therefore, the patient was felt to have suffered a non-Q-wave
myocardial infarction secondary to a right coronary artery
culprit lesion and was noted on catheterization to have
severe 3-vessel disease, however, was not felt to be a
surgical candidate.  Therefore, the patient was continued on
aspirin, Plavix, and Lipitor.  A 2B3A inhibitor continued to
be held given her history of bright red blood per rectum.  A
beta blocker was held until the intra-aortic balloon pump was
removed.  However, the patient was started right away on a
low-dose ACE inhibitor which was titrated up as tolerated.

On the day following her catheterization, the intra-aortic
balloon pump was weaned, and the patient tolerated this
without difficulty.  It was subsequently removed on
[**3-31**], and the heparin drip was discontinued.  The
patient was maintained on telemetry over the remainder of her
hospital stay and had no arrhythmic events.  Her Swan-Ganz
catheter was discontinued once the patient was felt to have
effectively diuresed, and Lopressor and captopril were
started back and titrated up as tolerated.

A transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained which
demonstrated a mildly dilated left atrium, with a normal left
ventricular wall and cavity size, but with hypokinesis of the
anterior and anteroseptal walls of the left ventricle, and
overall moderately depressed ventricular systolic function.
The right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion were
noted to be normal.  The patient demonstrated 2+ mitral
regurgitation and borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension without any evidence of pericardial effusion.

At the time of discharge, the patient was tolerating
administration of Zestril and atenolol with adequate blood
pressure response.  She was referred to follow up with her
cardiologist associated with her primary care physician at
the [**Hospital6 33**].

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient was noted to have a
positive urinalysis and mild fever at the time of admission.
A urine culture was obtained, and the patient was started on
ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.   The patient did not
demonstrate any symptoms of a urinary tract infection during
her hospital stay.  She completed a 5-day course of
ciprofloxacin for treatment of her urinary tract infection,
and subsequently remained afebrile, and her white blood cell
count normalized.  She had no further Infectious Disease
issues throughout the remainder her hospital stay.

3.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was noted to have a low
hema
