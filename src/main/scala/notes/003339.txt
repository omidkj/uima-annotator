Brief Hospital Course:
34 y/o M with DM1, gastroparesis, HTN, non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy (EF30-35%), admitted to the MICU with diabetic
ketoacidosis and abdominal pain c/w gastroparesis, hypertensive
urgency.

# DKA- DM1 since age 19. History of uncontrolled blood glucose,
also with gastroparesis and frequent N/V. Bglc on transfer to
MICU 246. Anion gap = 29 on arrival to ED.
**ICU Course: the patient presented initially with
hyperglycemia, but no initial gas to confirm acidosis, this was
treated in the ED and blood sugars had normalized and the gap
had closed appreciably, he was initially on an insulin drip
which was discontinued the next morning when he began taking
POs; he had labile blood sugars on HD2 likely due to nausea
after his glargine dose and then attempting to correct for the
resulting hypoglycemia.  He had normalized by the morning of HD3
and was tolerating a regular diet and blood sugars were well
controlled.  He never needed to go back on the drip.  [**Last Name (un) **] was
consulted and was following the patient.
**Floor course: Pt had labile sugars while on the floor, ranging
from 60-300s. His insulin regimen was titrated. Patient left
against medical advice on [**6-15**].

# Hypertensive urgency- History of labile BP, with multiple
admissions for hypertensive urgency/emergency. Unclear etiology
of labile BP. On home regimen of lisinopril, amlodipine, patch.
Currently hypertension is under control, will resume home
medication regimen.
**ICU Course: the patient received 20mg of IV labetalol in the
emergency department which improved his pressures, but
subsequently became hypertensive again and a nitroglycerine drip
was initiated in the MICU- the patient remained on this drip
through most of HD2 has he was still nauseous and would not
tolerate his PO antihypertensives.  The drip was discontinued on
HD3 and the patient took his home medications.  He never had any
neuro changes, and his renal function was baseline and he was
dialyzed regardless.
**Floor Course: BP remained stable on the floor with home
labetalol and [**Month/Day (4) 40899**] regimen. He left AMA shortly after
arriving on the floor to go to a Celtics basetball game.

#HyperKalemia - in the setting of ESRD, DKA, he was treated in
the ED, downtrended to 4.8. Improved with medical management and
hemodialysis.

# ESRD: On TuThSa HD. He was given HD for hypertensive
emergency/pulmonary edema and hyperkalemia. Received HD on
hospital Day 2 and 3.

# Gastroparesis: patient with history of gastroparesis, receives
relief with zofran, dilaudid, morphine
**ICU Course: treated with antiemetics and pain medications.
