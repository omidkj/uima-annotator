Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1115**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status, need for IVFs and diuresis concomitantly
(for hypercalcemia)


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
81 yo male with history of hypertension, coronary artery
disease, and hypercalcemia that has not been worked up in the
past, presents with altered mental status.  At baseline, patient
is alert and oriented x [**1-25**].  Today, the patient's daughter
found the patient to be altered, and more agitated and agressive
than usual.  She noted that he was generally weak as well, and
had trouble picking up his coffee cup.  The family reports that
the patient had been somewhat weak for weeks and has recently
had some problems with falling.  They deny any history of
fevers, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, or diarrhea.
Patient does have a history of chronic cough, which has not
worsened or changed in character over the past few days.  There
was report of difficulty swallowing, as well as auditory
hallucinations as well, though these could not be classified
further.  The patient denies any urinary symptoms.  He initially
presented to the OSH where they performed CT head which
demonstrated no intracranial hemorrhage, and small age
indeterminate lacunar infarct in the basal ganglia.  Labs at the
OSH were notable for elevated BNP for which patient received 60
mg of IV Lasix.  Troponin at the outside hospital <0.01.  BNP
was noted to be 9207.  Head CT was performed and reportedly
negative.

In the ED, initial vitals were T 97.4, P 52, BP 200/100, R 20,
Sat 92%RA.  Patient's neurological exam was non-focal, and
patient followed commands.  Patient was reported to be
O2-dependent, but refusing to wear oxygen.  ECG showed no
evidence of STEMI, with normal intervals.  Lab testing revealed
calcium of 11.9, free calcium 1.52, and creatinine of 2.0 from
baseline of 1.5.  BNP was 7984.  Hematocrit was noted to be
46.5.  Chest X-ray revealed diffuse reticular opacities with
bibasilar opacities that likely represent fibrosis but may
represent pneumonia, with no effusions and no congestion.
Patient was given levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1 for this finding.
Patient developed erythema and pruritus around the infusion
site, and was administered diphenhydramine 50 mg IV x 1, which
helped symptomatically.   Urinalysis was negative.  ABG showed
7.43/34/53/23.  Patient was initially admitted to medical floor,
but team thought that since patient would require fluids and
diuresis that it would require closer monitoring in an ICU.

On the floor, the patient reports being tired at the current
time.  He reports no chest pain or dyspnea, no abdominal pain.
