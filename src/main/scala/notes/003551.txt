Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
66 yoF w/ a h/o myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] presents with labored
breathing. The patient had been at [**Hospital6 10353**] for the
past 1 month with pneumonia and COPD. She had planned on being
transferred to rehab today and had also had a scheduled
neurology appointment. While at the neurologist's office she was
noted to have labored breathing. She did not feel subjectively
short of breath and per her daughter, she had similar breathing
for the month. While at the neurologist's office the physician
stated that she appeared in no shape to go to rehab and should
go to the emergency room.

The patient currently denies any SOB, chest pain, pleuritic
chest pain, hemoptysis or cough. She has been relatively
immobile at the hospital, but with assistance can walk with a
walker. Her husband noticed some pedal edema (bilateral) 3 days
ago. Per her daughter she has memory deficits and occasional
confusion.

The patient denies urinary complaints, constipation or diarrhea,
nausea / vomiting, no fevers / chills.

In the ED, initial VS: T 97 HR 90 BP 128/80 RR 24 O2 sat: 100%
on 3L. She underwent a CTA of her chest which revealed
subsegmental PEs. Her EKG revealed an STE so a code stemi was
called, cardiology fellow evaluated the patient and deemed this
not to be a STEMI and suggested a CTA of her chest. The patient
had rec'd ASA and plavix load (300mg). VS prior to tranfer HR
92, BP 99/62, RR 28, 96% on 3L.

Past Medical History:
1. Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] Dx in [**2121**]: primary neurologist in
[**Location (un) 38**], mild crisis in past marked by visual changes

IMAGING:

CXR ([**4-2**]) - IMPRESSION: Left basilar atelectasis. Unchanged
cardiomegaly.

CTA Chest ([**4-2**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe segmental and subsegmental acute pulmonary
embolism.
2. Persistent but slightly decreased right infrahilar density
now measuring 11 x 13 mm. As mentioned previously, PET-CT is
recommended to exclude underlying neoplasm.
3. Interval resolution of left upper lobe opacity. Left upper
lobe 7-mm nodule unchanged from the most recent prior, but new
from [**2122-3-8**]. Follow up chest CT in [**9-19**] months is
recommended.
4. Extensive atherosclerotic [**Date Range 1106**] disease.
5. Multiple new wedge deformities within the thoracic spine.

Bilateral LE LENIs - IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive thrombus extending
from the distal right common
femoral vein into the mid superficial femoral vein and proximal
deep femoral vein.

Echo ([**4-5**]) - The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic
root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
promient fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular size with preserved global
and regional systolic and diastolic function. Moderately dilated
right ventricle with borderline normal free wall function in the
setting of abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. Moderate aortic root
dilatation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2122-8-25**],
the pulmonary artery systolic pressures are higher. The other
findings are similar

Brief Hospital Course:
66 y/o F w/ a h/o myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], COPD and recent
hospitlization for PNA/COPD presents from neurologist oupt
office for labored breathing found to have pulmonary emboli.

# Pulmonary Emboli: The patient had no history of PE in the
past. She was on coumadin for afib and CVA but subtherapeutic on
admission. She was continued on coumadin, with an increased dose
and goal more in the 2.5-3 range. She was also started on a
heparin gtt which . She had lower extremity ultrasounds
performed which showed nonocclusive thrombus extending from the
distal right common femora
