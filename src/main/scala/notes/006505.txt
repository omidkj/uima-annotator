History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 112076**] is a 70 yo with h/o CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy
with EF of 20-25%, AS (mean gradient 33-40), diabetes with
neuropathy, HTN, presenting to [**Hospital1 **] with chest pressure, and
dyspnea. He first started feeling the chest pressure on Sunday
morning. It was centralized, without radiation. Over the day it
remained, with some slight improvement, however he noted DOE and
fatigue that was worsening. By the afternoon, he called the
ambulance and was brought to [**Hospital3 3765**]. There, his VS
were: afebrile with SBP 166, sat 93% on RA and 96% on 2L. His
troponin trend was: 0.111->5.514->3.281. Patient was placed on
lovenox, statin, [**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], coreg, and was evaluated by
cardiology. His BNP there was 1426, and CXR was consistent with
heart failure. He was diuresis with one dose of lasix in the ED,
but not further as O2 sat was good. Echo showed EF 20-25%,
ventricular dilatation, paradoxical septal wall motion, distal
apical kinesis, severe hypokinesis to akinesis, significant AS,
mod-severe mitral regurg, mild TR regurg w/ pulm htn, biatrial
enlargement. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a catheterization.

Patient underwent catheterization here on [**2165-4-23**] which showed
severe AS, tightly occluded LCX (prox and mid 80%) and patent
LAD, prior stent and patent non-dominant RCA, possible aortic
aneurysm. Cardiac surgery was consulted for  for AVR/CABG.

Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Dilated LV cavity. Severe regional LV systolic
dysfunction. Severely depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Simple
atheroma in ascending aorta. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Severe AS (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Moderate (2+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate to severe [3+] TR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Written informed consent was obtained from the
patient. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the
procedure. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears to
be A-V paced. Results were personally reviewed with the MD
caring for the patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
Prebypass

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity is dilated. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesia of the apex,
hypokinesia of the apical and mid portions of the inferior,
inferoseptal, inferolateral, anterior and septal walls.. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
20 %). with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There are
simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
