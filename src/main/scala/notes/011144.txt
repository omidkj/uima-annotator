Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation for respiratory failure
Bronchoscopy
Ultrasound guided thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 30207**] is a 67 yo woman with COPD, SCLC (s/p chemo/XRT), who
presented [**8-12**] to OSH with SOB that awoke her from sleep. She
was treated for CHF exacerbation with nitro gtt and diuresis,
despite no known history of heart disease. EKG at OSH notable
for T-wave inversions v2-v4, II, avF which later normalized. She
was also noted to have a leukocytosis with WBC 15k and 5% bands.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, BP=117/64, HR=110, RR=22, sat recorded
as 98%. Pt transported on BIPAP 10/5. Nitro drip initially
continued and pt given first doses of ceftriaxone, azithro, and
levaquin. Pt's pressures dropped to SBP~60-70s, still mentating.
Nitro drip was discontinued. Soon after this, pt reportedly
requested intubation for increased work of breathing. Pt
intubated with versed boluses for sedation and sent for CTA
prior to arrival to floor. CTA notable for no PE, RLL
consolidation, extensive emphysematous changes, possible
empyema. She was admitted to the MICU.
.
In the MICU, she underwent broncoscopy with removal of RLL
mucous plug. Respiratory function improved considerably and she
was extubated promptly. Ceftriaxone, vanc, and clinda were given
initially. However, vanc and clinda were discontinued the
morning of [**8-15**] as this was felt to be more likely
community-acquired PNA. Currently breathing well on RA. The
conclusion of the MICU team was that her recent respiratory
failure was primarily of an infectious rather than CHF etiology.
She has continued to be intermitently low-grade febrile.
.
Mental status has also been an issue. At baseline she has
dementia with 24- hour home care. In the MICU she has been
intermittently agitated getting xanax .25 mg q6h PRN with good
effect. Additionally, IP was consulted to evaluate if stent
placement would be beneficial; they advised against any such
intervention.
.
On acceptance to the medicine service, the patient denies
shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, or hemoptysis. She
further denies abdominal pain, diarrhea/constipation, blood in
bowel movements, pain with urination, or other complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 67 F with a history of SCLC and previous PNA
presneting with a large (complex appearing) RLL consolidation,
leukocytosis w/ left shift, and respiratory distress requiring
intubation, all of which suggest a significant RLL pneumonia.
.
Hospital course by issue:
.
#  PNEUMONIA: Large RLL consolidation, white count, and
increasing O2 requirement all c/w PNA. Not displaying septic
physiology currently although UOP on admission was the lower end
of normal. Surprising that she did not present sooner given
magnitude of PNA.  On Ceftriaxone, Clindamycin, and Vancomycin
for possible cavitary pneuomonia. Low UOP was likely [**2-27**] to
infection and third spacing. She was given IVF with goal UOP >
30cc/hr. A bronchoscopy was also done on [**2130-8-13**] to look for
endobronchial lesions. No obvious abnormality, besides a large
mucous plug was found. Sputum was sent for gram stain and
cytology. The night of [**2130-8-13**] the patient had a temperature
spike of 101F. Blood, urine, sputum, and stool cultures were
resent, none of which came back positive.  She also underwent a
thoracentesis on [**2130-8-17**] for drainage of a right sided pleural
effusion that was suspicious for empyema.  Drainage showed no
frank pus, likely a complicated parapneumonic effusion.  Air
seen on CT prior had decreased, this was thought to be a
bronchopleural fistula that has since sealed.  She shall need a
follow up CT scan.  Pt was switched to levofloxacin 750mg to
finish a 10 day course.
.
MS changes - patient had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status
initially, now stable, although still has baseline dementia.
.
# ARF: Cr initially at 1.5 from baseline of 1.0. Likely
intravascular depletion in the setting of third spacing from
significant infection. Has since improved back to baseline
during hospital course.
.
# Anemia: Pt found to have hct down as low as 23.  During
hospital course, has stabilized to 28.  Iron studies sent
consistent with anemia of chronic inflammation.
.
# SCLC: to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Hospital1 **] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 23509**]
.
#Rash: Pt developed a urticarial rash on back and legs just
prior to discharge that was itchy.  This was believed to be a
contact dermatitis, and she was given [**Name (NI) 6398**] lotion for
symptomatic relief.
.
# Communication: Patient  +  HCP/ATTORNEY [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 79797**]
.
# Dispo: To [**Doctor Last Name **] green nursing home.  However, the patient has
safety issues at home and will need social work to help work
with HCP to determine best future course.
