Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure, blast crisis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
# Central line insertion
# Arterial line insertion
# Intubation

History of Present Illness:
72M h/o Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, secondary AML (M4) (transfusion
dependent), transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED from [**Hospital1 1474**] after
developing hypotension, fever and respiratory distress after
transfusion.
.
After receiving a blood transfusion on the day of admission, pt
developed dyspnea (88% on 4L NC), chills and diaphoresis, with T
100.1, and creatinine 3.9 from 1.8 earlier in [**Month (only) 958**].  Pt was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 1474**] ED where he was found to be
tachycardic, febrile to T 103, increasingly dyspneic, and
vomiting.  Pt underwent elective intubated, after which he was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  En route, patient became
hypotensive despite 1.5 L NS bolus, and phenylephrine was
started.
.
Prior to admission, pt had been recently treated for a sinus
infection with levofloxacin and amoxicillin/clavulanate.
.

Pertinent Results:
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2107-3-29**] 8:20 PM
1. Standard position of the endotracheal and NG tube.
2. Diffuse increased interstitial marking consistent with the
mild interstital edema. The differential includes congestive
heart failure, fluid overload or transfusion-related lung
disease (TRALI).
.
# TTE Echocardiogram [**2107-3-30**] 11:40:43 AM
No evidence of endocarditis or abscess seen. Dilated,
hypokinetic right ventricle with pressure/volume overload. Mild
mitral regurgitation.
.
# CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2107-4-1**] 12:20 AM
1. No acute pathology to explain the patient's upper extremity
neurologic findings. Please note, MRI is more sensitive for
evaluation of cord pathology.
2. Right apical ground-glass opacity is nonspecific and may
represent underlying infection or alveolar edema.
.
# CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2107-4-1**] 12:20 AM
1. No acute pathology to explain the patient's upper extremity
neurologic findings. Please note, MRI is more sensitive for
evaluation of cord pathology.
2. Right apical ground-glass opacity is nonspecific and may
represent underlying infection or alveolar edema.
.
# CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2107-4-1**] 12:16 AM
1. No acute intracranial pathology identified. Please note MRI
is more sensitive for evaluation of ischemia or lymphomatous
involvement.
2. Chronic appearing sinus changes with suggestive element of
acute sinusitis involving the left maxillary sinusitis. This
should be correlated with clinical exam.
.
# CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2107-4-1**] 3:33 AM
Mild interval improvement of bilateral airspace opacities.

Brief Hospital Course:
72M h/o secondary AML, admitted with respiratory failure s/p
transfusion and blast crisis.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Pt developed acute respiratory
decompensation after receiving blood products, raising the
concern for TRALI, transfusion-associated cardiac overload [**2-5**]
acute diastolic CHF, progressive AML with leukostasis,
overwhelming infection 2/2 blood products received, or PNA, with
the first two etiologies considered most likely.  Pt was
maintained on ARDS Net protocol while intubated, with VAP
prevention, and was covered empirically with vancomycin,
ceftazidime, and levofloxacin for PNA.  Cultures were pending
for blood products received at OSH; blood and urine cultures
were negative or pending during admission.  Pt was extubated
without incident, and maintained on face tent with good oxygen
saturations.  His family was very clear that they wished to
proceed with hospice care.  He was therefore made CMO. He
subsequently developed increased dyspnea and hypoxemia
(uncertain etiology; perhaps leucostasis) and expired.
.
# Hypotension: Likely underlying etiologies considered were
systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis [**2-5**] PNA or
transfusion-related infection, or cardiogenic shock [**2-5**] NSTEMI
given pt's h/o CAD.  Pt was maintained on pressors initially but
was weaned off.  Echocardigram demonstrated focal wall motion
abnormality, with rising cardiac enzymes.  Given pt's low
platelets, aspirin was not administered; as pt was hypotensive,
beta blockers were also held.
.
# Tumor lysis syndrome: Given pt's high phosphate, worsening
creatinine, and hyperuricemia, initial concern was for tumor
lysis syndrome.  Pt was hydrated with bicarbonate added to
alkalinize urine, and was started on rasburicase, with
hematology/oncology following.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure:  Immediate etiology considered
was uric acid nephropathy given pt's high uric acid.  No
remarkable casts or crystals were noted on urine sediment.
Hemodialysis was held absent active indication.  Creatinine
improved throughout admission with gentle hydration with added
bicarb and rasburicase.
.
# DIC: Initial concern raised for DIC given low platelets and
elevated coags, but no schistocytes were apparent and DIC labs
were negative.  Platelets were transfused to maintain
10,000-20,000.
.
# Transaminitis: Elevated LFTs were noted with unclear etiology;
underlying causes considered were tumor infiltrate of liver
given pt's possible hepatomegaly on exam.  RUQ ultrasound was
held given pt's non-cholestatic picture, and LFTs were trended.
.
# Blast crisis: Pt was noted to have WBC elevated to 165,
indicating likely acute blast crisis.  Given pt's deteriorated
mental status as well as his oncologic prognosis, the decision
was made to not intervene with any acute therapies.  Pt was
therefore made CMO.
.
# Mental status: Pt was noted to have altered mental status,
absent response to noxious stimuli, and absent responsiveness
after extubation.  CT head and C-spine were negative for acute
pathology.  Concern was for significant neurologic involvement
of AML.  The decision was made to not intervene with any acute
therapies, and pt was made CMO.
