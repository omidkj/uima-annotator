Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP, biliary stent placed
Intubation/Mechanical Ventilation
PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
55 yo morbidly obese male with history of DM II, CAD s/p CABG,
chronic bilateral lymphedema, and obesity hypoventilation
syndrome presented with intermittent LUQ abdominal pain.  He
initially presented to the OSH with fever to 102.9, and a sharp,
intense, stabbing pain awoke him from sleep.  It was initially
LUQ pain but radiated to the RUQ.  He took a double dose of his
pain medication and the pain went away.  He tried to avoid pain
medication later in the day, but the pain came back.  He also
notes red extremities, but denies cough, SOB, CP, nausea,
vomiting, dysuria, or diarrhea.  He presented to the OSH for
this acute worsening of his abdominal pain.  He was found to
have a transaminitis with an elevated lipase.  His urine was
clear after antibiotics. Zosyn was started for empiric coverage
of his cellulitic process and for intraabdominal coverage.  He
was given Dilaudid with subsequent somnolence.  ABG at that time
revealed 7.28/81/52/38.  All narcotics were held and he was
placed on BiPap with subsequent improvement.
.
His hospital course continued with his respiratory status helped
some by diuresis.  The next morning he was pain free but his
bilirubin continued to climb from 2.6 upon admission.  Now, his
pain has returned in the RUQ though not particularly severe.
Bilirubin now 4.5, AlkPhos 185, with a mild transamnitis
(60s-80s).  GI saw him at [**Location (un) 2251**] and they were unwilling to
intervene.   Given his persistent pain and transaminitis, RUQ
u/s was performed which revealed GB wall inflammation and
thickening up to 1cm without any stones visualized.  [**Doctor First Name **] there
refused to take him for cholecystectomy, so he was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for potential intervention.
.
On the floor, he is sedated and difficult to arouse.  He is
falling asleep during conversation but notes improved abdominal
pain.  He denies any other symptoms of CP, SOB, palpitations, N,
V, diarrhea, constipation, or leg pain.  He reports
noncompliance with his BiPap machine noting that he "is an
idiot".
.

Imaging:
Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function.

RUQ U/S: [**2133-6-30**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Mildly echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. No
intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
2. Small gallstone. Limited evaluation of gallbladder does not
demonstrate
evidence of acute cholecystitis
.
Gallbladder scan:[**2133-7-1**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Cholecystitis, cannot determine whether this is acute versus
chronic.
.
RUQ U/S: [**2133-7-5**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Contracted gallbladder with multiple gallstones. No evidence
of acute
cholecystitis.
2. Mildly echogenic liver, consistent with fatty infiltration.
Superimposed fibrosis and cirrhosis cannot be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
55 yo morbidly obese male with history of DMII, CAD s/p CABG,
chronic bilateral lymphedema, and obesity- hypoventilation
syndrome presented with RUQ and LUQ abdominal pain, found to
have rising LFTs, fever and evidence of cholecystitis on
ultrasound.
.
# Abdominal Pain: Pt presented to OSH with LUQ and RUQ abdominal
pain and elevated LFTs. Transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ICU because
surgery and ERCP services at the OSH were hesitant to intervene
in this morbidly obese patient with multiple comorbidities. His
symptoms were thought to be caused by either gallstone
pancreatitis, cholangitis, an
