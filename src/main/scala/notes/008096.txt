Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
This is a generally healthy 59-year-old woman with no
significant past medical history who is transferred from LGH for
bilateral lower extremity DVTs and PE.  Patient states that she
was in her usual state of health until [**Holiday 1451**] when she
noticed some swelling in her left leg.  She saw her PCP and was
diagnosed with a DVT; she was put on Lovenox bridge to coumadin
and according to patient, her INRs have been therapeutic.
Patient was doing well until [**Holiday **] time when she began
developing shortness of breath with minimal exertion and
pleuritic chest pain.  She represented to LGH today where she
was diagnosed with a DVT of her right saphenous vein and
bilateral PEs (majority on right side).  A large right-sided
consolidation was seen on CTA, consistent either with pneumonia
or less likely, pulmonary infarct.  Patient was febrile at LGH
and was started on levaquin.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
higher level of care.
.
Upon arrival in ED, initial vitals were: 100.4, 110, 114/76, 18,
100% 2L.  An EKG showed sinus tachycardia without evidence of
right heart strain.  Patient was transferred to ICU for close
monitoring in context of large clot [**Hospital1 8373**].  Upon transfer,
vitals were: BP: 118/64, HR: 106, 99% on 2L.
.
ROS:  Positive for dyspnea on exertion, pleuritic right-sided
chest pain, weakness.  Patient denies fevers/chills at home,
recent weight loss, change in her stools, vaginal bleeding, or
any other concerning signs or symptoms.

Past Medical History:
Recent left lower extremity DVT

Social History:
Patient lives with her husband, her daughter, and her
grand-daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] is a great-grandmother.  She is a
homemaker.  Smoked 1PPD "forever" but recently cut down to 3-4
cigarettes/day after DVT diagnosis; used to drink 2 glasses of
wine/night but stopped now that on coumadin.  No miscarriages.
Has not had a mammogram or a colonoscopy.  Last pap smear was
over 10 years ago.

Family History:
Sister with DVT and Factor V Leiden mutation.  Mother with
"breast lump" that was removed.  Mother died of respiratory
failure and father died of AD.

EKG [**2158-12-12**]:
Baseline artifact. Sinus tachycardia. Short P-R interval. T wave
abnormalities. No previous tracing available for comparison.
Clinical correlation is suggested.

CXR [**2158-12-11**]:
chest read in conjunction with CT scanning of the chest
earlier in the day performed elsewhere: Heterogeneous
opacification at the base of the right lung conforms to the
appearance on CT scanning earlier today, most likely pneumonia
or extensive aspiration. Small right pleural effusion is
probably still present. The heart is normal size. Left lung is
clear. Mild emphysema is demonstrated on the CT scan.

ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND [**2158-12-12**]
1. Minimal ascites, tiny right pleural effusion and cystic
pelvic masses,
one of which in the right hemi-pelvis has a solid component.
These findings are strongly concerning for ovarian carcinoma.
2. Gallstones and no evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary
dilatation.
3. Normal-appearing liver.

CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS W/WO CONTRAST [**2158-12-14**]
1. Large mixed solid and cystic pelvic mass, concerning for
gynecologic
malignancy (likely ovarian adenocarcinoma). Trace complex
ascites. No
definite evidence of intra-abdominal metastasis.
2. Evolving right lower lobe infarct, secondary to PE.
3. Bilateral DVT, involving the IVC and bilateral iliac/femoral
veins.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 59-year-old woman with a pmhx. significant for recent
left lower extremity DVT now with bilateral lower extremity DVTs
and PE, who was found to have a pelvic mass on CT concerning for
ovarian cancer.
.
ACTIVE ISSUUES:
1. PE/DVT:  She was initially admitted to the ICU for management
of large PE/DVT, though there was no evidence of hemodynamic
compromise or right heart strain.  Patient was started on
heparin gtt for anticoagulation and required high doses to
become therapeutic.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled and were
negative.  A right upper quadrant ultrasound performed for an
urelated reason showed ascites and a cystic pelvis mass
concerning for ovarian cancer, which was again seen on pelvic CT
scan.  Hypercoagulable state of malignancy is a likely
precipitant in her case, though there is possibly a compressive
mass-effect of the mass as well causing hemostasis.  She was
bridged to coumadin after transfer to the general medicine floor
and her heparin gtt was subsequently stopped on the day of
discharge.  She was then switched to subQ lovenox prior to
discharge (80mg [**Hospital1 **]) due to its possibly higher efficacy in the
context of malignancy, and due to the fact that she promptly
clotted when she presented with a subtherapeutic INR.  She will
likely require indefinite anticoagulation.

2. OVARIAN MASS:  LFT abnormalities prompted an abdominal US,
which showed complex ascites and a pelvic mass with cystic and
solid components.  A follow up CT scan confirmed the presence of
a mass highly concerning for ovarian adenocarcinoma.  Her Ca125
was elevated above 1200.  She was seen by the GYN/ONC and
HEME/ONC teams.  She was not deemed to be a surgical candidate
due to her extensive clot [**Last Name (LF) 8373**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] a preliminary plan for
