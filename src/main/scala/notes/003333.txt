Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
Elective Pulmonary Vein Isolation for Atrial Fibrillation -
Post-PVI monitoring

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pulmonary Vein Isolation


History of Present Illness:
Since Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] last saw him in [**Month (only) 359**], Mr. [**Known lastname 37217**] had an
overall increase in his burden of AF, with fairly frequent
episodes with progressively increasing fatigue over the last few
months despite being on amiodarone. This led to him having a
repeat echocardiogram that was done earlier this month, which
exhibited a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% as well as
mild AR, mild-to-moderate MR, and borderline pulmonary
hypertension, which was unchanged from his previous study.  He
continues to take amiodarone 200 mg a day as well as warfarin
for thromboembolic prophylaxis.  His ventricular response to AF
fibrillation that day was about 110 beats per minute.  He had
previously been on Toprol and then was switched to Bystolic and
he believes that his heart rate has been faster in AF since
switching to Bystolic.

.

In terms of his ongoing management, he wished to be aggressive
in restoring consistent sinus rhythm.  He requested to undergo
pulmonary vein isolation. He did a cardiac MRI prior to this
procedure as ordered post-consult (see below).

.

He went for a pulmonary vein isolation today ([**2143-4-11**]). Ablation
started at 9:37am; at 1228 noted to go into heart block with
RFA, external pacing without effect at 200ma, CPR started and
sustained for 2minutes. BP stable and saturation did not drop
throughout episode. Patient reverted to flutter. At 1243 pt in
flutter with SBP in 80s, external DCCV with 100J with reversion
to sinus briefly. Patient received totals of 4L NS/LR with UOP:
16500cc. Decision made to transfer patient to the CCU for
post-isolation monitoring.



In the CCU VSS, telemetry with intermittent sinus tachy with
flips to sinus brady. His only complaint is some soreness at the
back of his throat which he attributes to "putting a breathing
tube" during the procedure, but it does not bother him
otherwise.

He currently denies any chest discomfort, SOB, palpitations,
dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 37217**] is a 72 year old man with history of paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation s/p pulmonary vein isolation with procedure
complicated by complete heart block transferred to the CCU for
monitoring.
.
# Complete Heart Block/Arrthymias. Complete heart block
transient in the setting of PVI. Question of vagal event
precipitating event. In the CCU patient oscillated from sinus
bradycardia to sinus tachycardia. Blood pressures remained
stable and patient largely asymptomatic. On evening of transfer
patient given 400mg PO QD. Decision made to uptitrate amio to
200mg PO TID for one week followed by 200mg PO BID x 3-4weeks.
Patient also discharged with [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts Monitor for planned
3 week monitoring.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- Rhythm control with Amio: 600QD x1 week, followed by 200mg PO
BID
-- Discharged with [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts
-- Continued on home metoprolol 25mg XL QD.
.

# Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation s/p PVI. Unfortunately
procedure terminated prior to complete ablation. Post-procedure
patient was monitored for general procedure-related
complications: groin site pain / erythema / swelling / bleeding,
Retroperitoneal bleeding. Patient reverted back into aflutter
intermittently.
1. Rhythm/Rate. Amio uptitrated and beta-blocker contined.
2. Anticoagulation continued with home Coumadin; INR therapeutic
in house
.
# Coronary Artery Disease s/p stent placement in [**2131**]
