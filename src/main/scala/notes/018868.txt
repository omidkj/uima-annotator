Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. was hypotensive (50's over 30's), hypothermic (96.0) and so
was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], a right IJ was placed emergently and aggressive
fluid resusitation was begun. Dopamine was also started
peripherally while central line was placed. Her BP responded
well and she was changed to levophed after central line placed.
Broad spectrum antibiotics were started.  She was weaned from
pressors the following day and continued to have good oxygen
saturations and BP. She in fact becamse hypertensive and her
metoprolol was restarted with good effect. Her mental status
recovered somewhat in that she opened her eyes to voice,
occasionally interacted with staff, and was able to speak a few
words. Per her family she did not yet appear at her MS [**Hospital Unit Name 5348**].
She failed a speech and swallow and it was recomended that she
be NPO and placed on NGT feeds.  She was transfered to the floor
hemodynamically stable, tolerating her tube feeds, and sating
97-100% on 1-2L NC.
.
On transfer to the floor, her course was as follows:

# fever:
Patient was initially afebrile, completed vancomycin and
ceftriaxone for 14 days for pneumonia and was stable off
antibiotics. However, she began spiking fever on [**1-2**]. Repeat
urinalysis on [**1-2**] was c/w UTI. Her CXR still show right sided
consolidation but patient did not have sputum production. She
also had clinical evidence of aspiration per nursing staff.
Given that lung and urine was her potential infectious source,
she was started on vanco/zosyn [**1-3**], flagyl [**1-4**] and added
fluconazole [**1-4**] for yeast in urine. Fever seem get better with
addition of fluconazole. vanco/zosyn/flagyl were d/c'd that week
given improvement in respiratory symptoms and fever.
Fluconazole was given to compelete a 10 day course.  Blood and
urine cultures remained negative except for >100K yeast in
urine.
Pt remained afebrile for the rest of her hospital course.

# acute renal failure
[**Month/Year (2) **] Cr was 0.8-0.9; creatinine began to rise on [**12-27**] and
continued to rise progressively to a peak of 3.7 on [**1-5**]. Renal
U/S was negative for any obstruction. Renal was consulted, felt
that ATN seemed most likely etiology in the setting of prior
hypotension. IVF were given initially, but then were limited by
pt's respiratory status. By [**1-6**], Cr began to decline and pt
began to diurese without any pharmacologic help.  By time of
discharge, patients creatinine had nearly returned to [**Month/Year (2) 5348**]
and was continuing to improve.

# Pulmonary edema:
Patient was hydrated with IVF for acute renal failure as above
and shortly thereafter began to have worsening respiratory
distress.  On exam, she had significant rales and some pulmonary
edema. She had been ruled out for MI by enzymes on [**12-21**] and
there were no obvious complain of chest pain. She was gently
diuresed with IV lasix and showed rapid improvement in
respiratory status, with improved oxygenation and decreased work
of breathing.  For the remainder of her hospital stay, IVF were
more limited and patient continued to improve.
.
# Altered MS/agitation:
Pt's mental status worsened transiently in setting of renal
failure and worsening pulmonary edema, then began to improve
again as these issues resolved.  By the time of discharge,
patient was more alert, able to answer some questions and follow
simple commands.

# Anemia:
Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5348**] Hct is 30-33. Pt's hct had continued to drift
slowly downward and ultimately required transfusion of 1unit
PRBC on [**12-27**].  Hct responded appropriately, but continued to
drift slowly downwards, and patient ultimately required a second
transfusion on [**1-8**].  No clear etiology on CT abdomen, but
patient had some brown guaic-positive stools on [**1-8**],
[**1-11**]. Likely has slow GI bleed causing her anemia.  Had been on
PPI, but given poor PO intake, new finding of heme-positive
stools, IV PPI was started on [**1-9**].  Overall, patient was
stable, and did not seem to have symptoms or physiologic
distress [**2-12**] anemia.
Will need to be intermittently followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
.
# nutrition
Patient initially had NGT but pulled it out numerous times. Had
failed speech and swallow. Family has said that they want to
avoid PEG, NG, would like to continue to feed her orally and
they understand the risk of aspiration(nectar thickened soft
food). Pt. given some PPN on floor to improve nutritional status
and bridge pt to PO's while waiting for her mental status to
improve.  By time of discharge, pt was taking some PO's but not
adequately to ensure good hydration, so was discharged with IVF
to rehab per Dr.[**Name (NI) 61245**] request.
.
# communication.
[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 61246**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 61247**]. Staff had
contact[**Name (NI) **] and communicated with her family on multiple
occassion. They agree with plan of some IV hydration, continued
PO's despite some aspiration risk, no enteral feeding tube.
Patient will remain DNR/DNI.
