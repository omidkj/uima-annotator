Brief Hospital Course:
61 y.o. woman with pmh COPD, found by VNA in her home on [**2116-3-11**]
with shortness of breath and somnolence. She was admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] in [**Month (only) **] for SOB with PNA and then discharged to a rehab.
She improved remarkably at the rehab and was discharged from
there on [**2116-3-2**]. She was off oxygen supplementation and had
stopped smoking during her rehab stay. Upon returning home she
started smoking again. On the day of admission, she was unable
to get up from bed due to severe weakness and SOB. She was also
noted to be confused by her VNA with her O2 sats in mid 70's/RA.
On admission, had hypercapneic respiratory failure and was
admitted to MICU.  CXR also with LLL PNA.  Was started on IV
steroids, broad Abx, nebs. Tolerated brief BiPAP, but kept
pulling off.  Her antibiotics were subsequently tapered to
levofloxacin alone on [**3-12**]. Transfered to Gen Med on [**3-13**]. While
on Gen Med, continued to be in COPD exacerbation and was treated
with duonebs q4, prednisone 40mg, levaquin. Repeat CXR showed
improved infiltrates and her Abx were stopped after a 7-day
course. Given frequency of exacerbations, decision made for slow
prednisone taper over 2weeks. The importance of smoking
cessation was repeatedly emphasized to her, and she acknowledged
understanding. Chantix was offered but she preferred to use
nicotine patches. Home O2 was arranged for her and increased VNA
services. When she is appropriately improved, she will be
referred to outpatient pulmonary rehab.
