History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old man with multiple medical problems
including COPD (2L home 02), DM2, GERD, HTN, HLD, CAD s/p NSTEMI
[**2126**], recurrent PNA, AAA, recent pneumothorax, CHF (EF=20-25%),
AS (valve area of 0.9cm2 and valve gradient of 38) AF on
coumadin, who is transferred from [**Hospital1 **] ICU to [**Hospital1 18**]
for increasing  pulmonary edema and hypotension.
.
On [**2133-12-8**], he presented to OSH with SOB, orthopnea, and PND,
similar to multiple admissions over the past years. Admitted
with a diagnosis of CHF exacerbation (BNP>500) in the context of
likely COPD flare, then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  Cardiac cath/TTE
showed severe aortic stenosis (valve area of 0.9cm2 and valve
gradient of 38).  His cardiac output was also preserved, at
5.4L/min.  Cardiac surgery and Pulmonary was consulted to
comment on his candidacy for AVR and he was deemed to be a poor
open surgical candidate due to his existing comorbidities, but
possibly for percutaneous valve replacement in the future.  He
was not aggressively diuresed, due to his preload dependence and
he was discharged to rehab on his daily 10mg predisone after
completing a 7-day taper.
.
The patient had a previous admission at NWH from [**2040-12-28**] was
initially admittted because of severe dywspnea and concerns for
an NSTEMI. At OSH lab studies were notable for acardiac enzyme
peak CK of 115 and MB of 10.7, with a peak troponin of 4.33.
Microbiology was notable for a urine culture which grew 2 types
of pseudomonas, subswuqently changed foley. His SOB was initally
believed to be [**2-17**] COPD flare/pneumonia than CHF. The patient
improved on IV solumedrol.
.
On his most recent admission on [**2134-1-11**], the patient noted that
he woke up this AM feeling SOB. He was given an albuterol neb,
which per pt worsened his SOB. In OSH ED he recieved adenosine
18 mg total which failed to break his tachypnea, and he was also
noted to be tachycardic into the 150s; he also recieved IV
lopressor and was transferred to ICU where he was placed on
BIPAP and given dilt 10 mg IV which [**Last Name (un) 4662**] HR down to 120s. The
patient was given abx for possible pneumonia in the setting of
elevated WBC to 26. Patient given iv lasix. methylprednisolone,
pantroprazole, and fluticasone/sealmeterol, tiotropium, insulin,
vancomycin, imipenem-calastin. Today the patient developed
acture respiratory distress that was not responsive to IV lasix
80s or a Lasix gtt; the team felt that his [**Last Name **] problem was
likely cardiac and mechanical, he should be transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**].
.
.
Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 18**], patient had an a line placed c sbp in the
140/70, noted tachypnia at 33, and face mask o2 at 12 L. HR 114.
He appears uncomfortable with accewssory muscle use, and was
transitioned to BIPAP.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2134-1-11**]
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**12-16**]:
Extensive opacification in right lower lung probably due to
pulmonary edema in the setting of chronic emphysema. Previous
pneumonia in the axillary subsegments of the left upper lobe
appears to have improved but there may be bronchietasis in its
wake. Heart is top normal size. Left PIC line ends at the origin
of the left brachiocephalic vein. No pneumothorax. Small
bilateral pleural effusions are present.
.
CXR [**2134-1-12**]
ET tube in standard placement. Left PIC line ends in the left
brachiocephalic vein and a nasogastric tube passes into the
stomach and out of view.  Heterogeneous opacification in the
right mid and lower lung zone has improved, probably due to
decreasing edema in the setting of severe emphysema, but the
asymmetry still raises concern for extensive pneumonia
particularly due to aspiration. Volume loss in the left lower
lobe is improving. Small bilateral pleural effusions are
presumed. No pneumothorax
.
CXR [**2134-1-13**]
1. Worsening left lower lobe atelectasis and mild interval
increase in size of bilateral pleural effusions, small on the
right, small-to-moderate on the left.
2. Resolving right pulmonary heterogenous opacity, either
represents
pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
.
CXR [**2134-1-14**]
IMPRESSION: Stable left lower lobe atelectasis and small left
pleural
effusion.
.
CXR [**2134-1-15**] Lines and tubes are stable. There are unchanged
bilateral pleural effusions, left side worse than right. Hazy
left retrocardiac opacity is also seen.  There is some
coarsening of the interstitial markings; however, no overt
pulmonary edema is identified.
.
CXR [**2133-1-16**]
Tracheal and nasogastric tube have been removed. There is a
right IJ central venous line with the distal lead tip in the mid
SVC. There is coarsening of the bronchovascular markings which
has worsened since previous. These are more confluent within the
right base. This may represent developing infiltrate or an
element of pulmonary edema. There is unchanged left-sided
pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory failure: Patient presented with large right-sided
infiltrates, pulmonary edema, and baseline end-stage COPD on
admission.  On admission he failed BIPAP trial prompting
intubation.  He was aggressively diuresed with IV lasix gtt and
then transitioned to IV lasix on [**1-15**]. Initial extubation
postponed secondary to significant aggitation.  Successful
extubation on [**2134-1-15**] with transition to BIPAP and then face
mask. He continued to be aggitated off sedation, olanzapine was
traded for haldol around the On [**1-16**] while having CVL replaced
and lying flat, developed significant dypsnea and increasing O2
requirement requiring re-intubation.  Repeat CXR consistent with
right-sided pleural effusion and increase in pulmonary vascular
markings consistent with likely flash pulmonary edema.  Patient
was extubated several days
