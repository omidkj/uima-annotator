Chief Complaint:
Malaise, Nausea

History of Present Illness:
77 year old man with a history of CAD s/p CABG, HTN, DMII, PVD
who p/w > 24 hours of malaise. He developed Vfib arrest in the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED and achieved a ROSC. He is being admitted to the MICU
for shock.
Mr. [**Known lastname 13859**] felt unwell throughout [**2194-11-6**]. He developed rigors
while eating dinner last evening. The patient felt unwell in the
evening and spoke to his PCP's office who suggested he come to
the emergency room. He had Nausea with vomitting in the middle
of the night. In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED waiting area, the patient
collapsed and was found to be in ventricular fibrillation. He
received 1 minute of CPR, was defibrillated once and then
received 1-3 minutes of CPR during which time he was given one
dose of epinephrine and one dose of atropine. He began making
purposeful movements at which time pulses were checked.
Spontaneous rhythm therefore had returned within 5 minutes and
the patient was intubated for airway protection. Per the
Cardiology consultation, the initial (5:06:08) ECG was atrial
flutter with 2:1 conduction. There were dramatic ST elevations
in V1-V2 as well as inferior ST depressions. A subsequent ECG
showed more subtle ST elevations in V1-V2, as well as ST
depressions in the inferior
and lateral precordial leads. Given the uncertainty a CODE STEMI

was called. The patient was given Aspirin 600mg PR, Plavix per
OGT and started on heparin. It is unclear whether he ever
received [**Name (NI) 13860**].
.
Simultaneously the patient was found to have A dense RLL
infiltrate on CXR, a rectal temp of 103.0 and became
progressively hypotensive on propofol. His sedative was switched
to Fent/Versed but hypotension persisted. He was started on
peripheral norepinephrine. Vancomycin and Zosyn were provided
and a Right IJ triple lumen was placed. A second CXR was taken
to confirm placement of the line.
.
ROS per Cardiology Consultation: The patient's wife denies that
he ever complained of chest pain. He has never had any chest
pain. She denied frank dyspnea and said he did have a cough.
They had seen the podiatrist a day earlier to evaluate a non
healing ulcer on the plantar surface of his right foot. The
patient reportedly had no diarrhea. A complete review of systems
could not be obtained because the patient was intubated and
sedated.

TTE [**2194-11-7**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV
systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction 40%)
secondary to hypokinesis of the anterior septum, anterior free
wall, and apex. Midseptal aneurysm/dyskinesis is present. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Due to the technically suboptimal nature of this study, an
intracardiac shunt cannot be excluded on the basis of this study
(consider transesophageal echocardiography).
