Chief Complaint:
chest pain, hypertension

esophagoduodenoscopy
cardiac catheterization
renal biopsy


History of Present Illness:
25 year-old W with PMHx of DM1 (Dx @ 15yo), HTN, chronic renal
insufficiency, and psoriasis, who was transferred from OSH for
evaluation of episodic chest pain X 2-4 months. The chest pain
is [**9-6**], left-sided, pressure-like, non-radiating that occurs
sporadically, with exertion or at rest, even awakening her from
sleep. It lasts for hours until alleviated by morphine or
dilaudid. It is associated with nausea and emesis, which
occasionally precede the chest pain. She has been evaluated
multiple times for this pain, and reports a history of 8 recent
hospital admissions with no conclusive diagnosis. She has been
treated for gastroparesis with no improvement in her chest pain.
According to prior notes, her pain was well controlled with
dilaudid as an outpatient; however, when this was abruptly
stopped the chest pains returned. She also notes that she
becomes hyperglycemic during these episodes despite taking her
insulin and not tolerating PO.
.
Of note, in [**2104-1-27**] the patient began to have "grand mal
seizures" which were diagnosed on clinical grounds and thought
to be due to hypoglycemic episodes at night.  She had tonic
clonic movements and occassional loss of bladder and bowel
control.  Her insulin regimen was changed, and the seizures
stopped in [**2104-9-28**].  She then began to have increasing
abdominal pain thought to be due to gastroparesis.  In [**Month (only) 547**] of
[**2104**], she underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy to treat her
gastroparesis.  She developed psoriasis during the same month.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.1 P106 BP 192/104 R 20 O2 sat
100 RA. Patient was experiencing intermittant chest pain,
controlled with morphine PRN.  Labs were notable for elevated
d-Dimer of 1059, creatinine 2.0, leukocytosis 17.2 and mild
anemia.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia.  She was initially
started on heparin gtt for suspicion of PE, but was found to
have guaiac + stools.  NG withdrew coffee grounds, 250cc lavage
was clear with trace blood.  Heparin gtt was stopped. EGD was
performed by GI and showed an esophageal ulcer and erosions in
the stomach and duodenum. The patient was started on a PPI. Her
Hct remained stable.  Bilateral LE doppler's were negative for
DVT.  Chest x-ray with no infiltrate, effusion or acute process.
Per report, CTA at OSH was negative.
.
In the ICU the patient developed chest pain, and was tachycardic
with blood pressures greater than 200/100.  She was given IV
morphine and IV metoprolol, with improvement of BP to systolic
130s. Her pain improved, but was not alleviated. Her EKG was
unremarkable. Cardiac enzymes were sent and were negative for
ACS. TTE demonstrated EF 35-40%, and cardiolgoy was [**Year (4 digits) 4221**].
She had coronary catheterization which demonstrated no
hemodynamically significant lesions. She was stable and
transferred to the floor for further evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Episodes of chest pain, nausea & vomiting, tachycardia and
hypertension: these episodes are still of unclear etiology. A
number of services were [**Month/Day/Year 4221**] and testing performed, which
did not reveal a clear explaination. Only dilaudid reliably
relieved her pain, and only ativan relieved her nausea. Our best
guess is that these episodes are related to autonomic
dysfunction secondary to a history of brittle diabetes. We have
made an outpatient appointment for her with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who
is an autonomic specialist. Of note, pheochromocytoma was ruled
out by both plasma and urine metanephrine measures. At the time
of discharge the patient had not experienced one of these
episodes for at least 72 hours.
