ADDENDUM:  The following addendum covers the patient's
hospitalization from [**2173-10-4**] to [**2173-10-9**].
The initial portion of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was
previously dictated.  Please see that other dictation for
details concerning the patient's hospitalization up through
[**2173-10-4**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.) Infectious disease:  The patient
completed a two week course of Meropenem.  He continued to
have an elevated white count although the differential
continued to show persistent eosinophilia.  It was believed
that this eosinophilia was most likely due to his Meropenem
allergy.  According to allergy and dermatology, it is
possible to have a delayed allergic reaction to medications
including antibiotics.  The patient showed no evidence of
infection.  The patient remained afebrile and hemodynamically
stable.

2.) Renal.  The patient was continued on hemodialysis
throughout the remainder of the hospitalization.  Prior to
discharge, his right sided Quinton catheter was changed by
transplant surgery service to a tunnel catheter.  Immediately
following the placement of the tunnel catheter, it was noted
that the arterial line had poor flow. The ports had to be
reversed so the line could be used for hemodialysis.  The
renal service noted that it is possible to have poor flow due
to swelling postoperatively. They felt that the patient could
be discharged and continued on hemodialysis as an outpatient.

The renal consult service will be contacting the nephrologist
at the rehabilitation facility the patient is being
discharged to.

3.) Cardiovascular:  The patient remained hemodynamically
stable throughout the remainder of the hospitalization.
Prior to discharge, the patient was started on very low dose
Carvedilol 3.125 mg p.o. twice a day which he tolerated well.
There was an attempt to start the patient on Captopril but
the patient was unable to tolerate this due to low blood
pressure.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Hemodynamically stable although bed
bound.  The patient is on hemodialysis due to acute renal
failure.  He is trached with a trach mask and FI02 of 40%.
He has a large sacral decubitus ulcer which appears to be
healing.

rehabilitation.
