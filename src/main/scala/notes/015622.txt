Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Lethargy, diffuse body pain, inability to ambulate


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Arthrocentesis of right wrist, left wrist, and right hallux
Central line placement
CVVH, dialysis catheter placement
Arterial Line Placement (Axillary)
EGD times 2
Attempted CT-guided Emoblization

History of Present Illness:
 66F with known RV and LV diastolic dysfunction, CKD with
baseline Cr 1.5, AF not on coumadin who presents with lethargy
and pain throughout her body, limiting her ability to walk,
which started approx. 4 days prior to admission. History is
limited as patient is poor historian and somnolent at times. She
denies any recent travel, new medications except prednisone
which was started approx. 5 days ago for R great toe pain.

In the ED, initial VS: 97.9 102 83/59 18 99% RA. Exam notable
for bruising over extremities and flank, non focal neuro exam,
DRE with guaiac positive brown stool. CXR showed no evidence of
PNA. UA showed trace leuks, 2 WBC, no bacteria or nitrites. She
was given 3L NS with no change in BP but lactate improved from
2.2 to 1.2. SBP was in the 40s at one point and a R IJ CVL was
placed under sterile conditions. She was started on
norepinephrine with minimal improvement in BP despite maxing
out. Dopamine was added and she was extremely responsive to
dopamine, with improvement in MAPs immediately. She was given
hydrocortisone 100mg IV x1 for stress dose steroids. She was
also given Zosyn and Vancomycin IV empirically given bandemia
and overall instability. CT abdomen/pelvis without PO or IV
contrast showed no clear cause for leukocytosis.

On arrival to the MICU, she complains of pain throughout her
body.

Imaging:
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is a persistent
rounded right lower lobe opacity with an unchanged moderate
right pleural effusion.  Minimal left dependent atelectasis is
identified, and there is also a trace left pleural effusion.
There is unchanged cardiomegaly and a PFO occlusion device
partially visualized.

Complete evaluation of the abdominal and pelvic viscera is
limited secondary to the non-contrast technique.  The liver
appears homogeneous without focal lesion.  No intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation is identified.
Redemonstrated is are multiple large gallstones measuring up to
1.9 cm.  The spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands appear normal.
 Kidneys are small though symmetric and without focal lesion or
hydronephrosis.

There is diffuse mesenteric edema with a small amount of
perihepatic ascites.  Edema within the subcutaneous tissues is
also extensive. Findings are likely secondary to aggressive
fluid resuscitation given clinical history of hypotension
requiring pressors.  The bowel overall appears within normal
limits without evidence of obstruction.  No focal loop of bowel
demonstrates surrounding inflammation or wall thickening.  The
appendix is retrocecal and remains dilated measuring up to 9 mm,
similar to prior (2:35).  There is a proximal appendicolith.  No
periappendiceal fluid collection is identified to suggest
developing abscess.  There is no extraluminal air.  The colon
appears normal without signs of inflammation or obstruction.
The abdominal aorta remains moderately calcified though
non-aneurysmal.

CT PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  A Foley catheter and a
small amount of air are visualized within the bladder, which is
otherwise unremarkable.  The uterus and adnexa appear
unremarkable.  There is trace pelvic free fluid.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No bone destructive lesion or acute
fracture is
identified.  Loss of vertebral body height at multiple lumbar
levels appears unchanged from prior examination.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Diffuse mesenteric edema, trace ascites, bilateral pleural
effusions and diffuse subcutaneous edema, findings consistent
with third spacing secondary to recent volume resuscitation.
2.  Persistently dilated fluid-filled appendix with surrounding
fat stranding suggestive of chronic appendicitis in this patient
who was treated medically for appendicitis in [**2111-2-19**].
Appendiceal mucocele remains a possibility given the duration of
CT abnormalities.
3.  Cholelithiasis.  If there is concern for cholecystitis, this
would be
better evaluated by ultrasound.
4.  Unchanged moderate-sized right pleural effusion with
overlying rounded
right lower lobe consolidation/rounded atelectasis.

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLER ULTRASOUND:  Examination was
limited
secondary to patient's body habitus and inability to cooperate.
The left calf veins could not be seen.  [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and Doppler
son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral,
and popliteal veins were obtained.  The right posterior tibial
and peroneal veins were also examined.  There is normal flow and
compressibility.  Edema is seen within the subcutaneous tissues
of the bilateral calves.

IMPRESSION:  No evidence of DVT in the lower extremities.  Left
calf veins not visualized.

WRIST IMAGING:
There are again seen severe degenerative changes of the first
CMC joint with subluxation.  This is similar to the prior study.
 No acute fractures are identified.  There is generalized
demineralization.  There are also
degenerative changes with joint space narrowing in the
radiocarpal joint.
There is prominent soft tissue swelling seen about the
