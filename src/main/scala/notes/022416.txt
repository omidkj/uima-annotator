Pertinent Results:
[**5-19**] Echo: PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left
atrium or left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage
emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). A left atrial
appendage thrombus cannot be excluded.
2. The right atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 3. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. Transmitral
Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade
III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. 4. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in
the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. There are complex (mobile) atheroma
in the descending aorta. 6. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (area
0.8-1.0cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 7. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. There is
a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral
stenosis. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen
with bilateral leaflet retraction and a central jet. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results. POST-CPB:
On infusions of epinephrine, milrinone, phenylephrine. AV
pacing. Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position
with trivial AI. Well-seated annuloplasty ring in the mitral
position. MR is now mild. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6507**] present during post bypass
exam. Significant air in esophagus with poor acoustic windows
post bypass. Aortic contour appears normal post decannulation.
LVEF now 40% on inotropic support.
[**5-24**] CXR: The lungs are hyperinflated and diaphragms are
flattened, consistent with COPD. There is calcification along
the diaphragm. This can be seen as sign of asbestos exposure.
The patient is status post sternotomy, with prosthetic valve.
There is moderate to moderately severe cardiomegaly. There is
parenchymal scarring. There is minimal blunting of the right
costophrenic angle posteriorly and a small amount of pleural
fluid or thickening along the right costophrenic angle. Also,
minimal blunting of the left costophrenic angle. Two prosthetic
valves are present. A small air-filled locule abuts the left mid
chest question small bleb or bulla. The wall appears more
thickened than on [**2150-5-21**] and attention to this area on followup
films to exclude a developing infection is requested. Doubt CHF
or focal infiltrate.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 33413**] was a same day admit after undergoing all
pre-operative work-up as an outpatient. On [**5-19**] he was brought to
the operating room where he underwent a redo-sternotomy x 2,
coronary artery bypass graft x 1, mitral valve repair, aortic
valve replacement, and over sewing of left atrial appendage.
Please see operative note for surgical details. Following
surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. On post-operative day one he was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. During
this time pressors were weaned off. On post-op day two his chest
tubes were removed. He required aggressive chest PT while in the
CVICU. Early post-op day three he had episodes of atrial
fibrillation but anticoagulation was not initiated due to his GI
bleeding history. He was started on beta blockers and diuretics
and diuresed towards his pre-op weight. On post-op day three he
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further care. On
post-op day four there appeared to be small amount of sternal
discharge and antibiotics were initiated. Over next couple of
days he worked with physical therapy for strength and mobility.
During this time he slowly improved and was ready for discharge
home with VNA services on post-op day six.
