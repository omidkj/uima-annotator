Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 66 yo F with HCV cirrhosis and minimal reserve
initially admitted with hepatic encephalopathy, and small bowel
obstruction.

# Small Bowel Obstruction: On [**2188-7-1**] the patient went to the OR
for repair of umbilical hernia and reduction of small bowel
obstruction. On [**2188-7-7**], she had Re-exploration of above
laparotomy for Bacterial peritonitis, extremely high peritoneal
ascites white count of 19,000. In that her liver failure
continued to progress, and she was vasopressor-dependent and had
poor urine output, there was concern for an intra-abdominal
pathology source fueling this peritonitis.  Upon repeat
laparotomy, there was no evidence of any compromise or bowel
death or obstruction; bowel was inflamed and edematous, as would
be expected from peritonitis, but there was no evidence of any
compromise nor incarcerated hernia.  She was treated with a
course of zosyn/vanco, was weaned off pressors and was
transferred out of the SICU onto the liver medical service.

# Altered Mental Status: She was confused and at times
inappropriate and agitated. Pt attempted to remove Foley and
PICC on several occasions. This was thought not entirely due to
hepatic encphalopathy as she was stooling well on standing
lactulose and rifaximin with decrease in asterixis.  She had
soft restraints and a 1:1 sitter. Her mental status was
improving. She was evaluated by Psych on [**2188-7-14**]. They
recommended Haldol as needed initially, and then standing doses
of Haldol after PRN was not sufficient. Psych also recommended
using lactulose for her hepatic encephalopathy. On [**7-28**] the
patient appeared somnolent and her standing Haldol dose was
[**Month/Year (2) 8910**] with an improvement in her mental status.  She
remained intermittantly confused, but was minimally agitated for
the remainder of her hospital course.

# Liver Failure/ HCV Cirrohsis: Pt was followed by the
Transplant team but determined not to be a transplant candidate.
She received lactulose enemas daily. She was having high ascitic
output, at times as much as 8 liters/day. With the high JP
output, her urine output was low (Hypovolemia). JP output was
replaced with saline. She was also ordered for Albumin to help
with the ascites.
She was unable to tolerate NGT feedings and she had a high
residual. Tubefeedings were stopped and she was started on TPN
while on the surgical service. She was seen by Speech and
Swallow and cleared for nectar thick liquids and ground
consistency solids, however, due to her poor PO she was
continued on TPN.  Her bilirubin continued to climb and this was
thought due to TPN.

# Hyperbilirubinemia: Total bilirubin was 5.2 on admission, and
with minor fluctuations, rose to 18.0 on [**7-24**].  Bilirubin
continued to rise daily to 28 on [**7-29**]. No further labs were
obtained after that time.

# Renal Failure: Upon callout from the surgical ICU, her
creatinine began to rise.  She had large volume output of
ascites from lap site that continued so it was intially
postulated that she was likely intravascularly dry due to
inadequate intake and high volume output from abdomen and stool.
 Her renal function, did not, however improve with fluid and
albumin challenge and thus renal was consulted for probable HRS.
 Given the trajectory of her renal failure and development of
oliguria/anuria, hemodialysis was considered.  In discussion
with her health care proxy, however, it was decided that rather
than to initiate HD, team would focus on comfort care.

# Anemia/GIB: She had post-op Anemia and received PRBCs as
needed for [**Month/Day (4) **] loss anemia. Her HCT on POD 1 was 20 and rose
to 26. Her HCT remained stable and low in the 23-24 range.
Thrombocytopenia was also noted. INR remained elevated. On [**7-26**]
the patient was found to have guiac positive emesis and a drop
in her hematocrit from 25-->19.  She was transferred to the ICU
and transfused 3 U pRBCs. Endoscopy showed evidence of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tear with stimata of recent bleeding.  She was sabilized
and returned to the hepatorenal service on [**7
