History of Present Illness:
74 y.o. male with COPD, CAD, DM with a chief complaint of
shortness of breath. Patient reported subjective fevers,
manifested by "feeling warm" along with additional symptoms of
nausea and a largely unproductive cough x 3 days. On the day of
admission, he woke up at 3 AM, "shaking" and feeling very cold.
He also felt acutely short of breath and nauseous with one
episode of bilious, non-bloody emesis. ROS otherwise significant
for increased LE swelling compared to baseline and increased
weight gain in general; one episode of loose stools without
hematochezia or melena.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, vitals were T - 99.5, HR - 119, BP 84/49, RR -
19, O2 - 94% on 4L. He was given 4 L of NS for the hypotension
with slow improvement so a CVL was placed, though no pressors
were started as his BP eventually rebounded. CXR revealed a
possible RLL PNA, for which patient was given Vancomycin,
Ceftriaxone and Levofloxacin. BNP was not elevated. Patient was
also felt to be wheezy and given ?history of COPD, Solumedrol
125 mg IV was given. Labs revealed a leukocytosis of 17 with 92%
neutrophils and 1 band. Lactate was elevated to 3.7, but
decreased to 3 with IVF. Given elevated lactate in the setting
of respiratory distress, patient was admitted to the ICU for
further management.

IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis.

[**2134-4-28**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses
or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The
