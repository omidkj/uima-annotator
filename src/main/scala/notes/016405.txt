Chief Complaint:
Abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Resection and repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm with 18 x 9
bifurcated aortobi-iliac graft.


History of Present Illness:
This 76-year-old gentleman was recently found to have a 6.4 cm
aneurysm which was a juxtarenal aneurysm of the infrarenal
aorta, also involving the right and left common iliac arteries.
The right iliac artery was actually frankly aneurysmal. The left
iliac artery was only ectatic. The patient was not a candidate
for stent graft based on anatomy and was advised to have an open
repair.

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *6.0 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm)
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 4.7 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm)
Left Ventricle - Systolic Dimension: 3.5 cm
Left Ventricle - Fractional Shortening: *0.26 (nl >= 0.29)
Aorta - Valve Level: 2.0 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm)

INTERPRETATION:
      Findings:
  LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the  body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA. All four pulmonary veins
identified and enter the left  atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D  images. Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity
size.

LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal;
basal
anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal
inferoseptal - normal;  mid inferoseptal - normal; basal
inferior - normal; mid inferior -normal;  basal inferolateral -
normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal anterolateral  -
normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal;
septal apex -  normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex -
normal; apex - normal;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve
leaflets. No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MS.
Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is  seen in the body of the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. No atrial septal  defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and  cavity
size are normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion  are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. There  are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly  thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.  The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation  is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 54864**] was admitted on [**2149-1-13**] for an elective Resection and
repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm with 18 x 9 bifurcated
aortobi-iliac graft . Pre-operatively, he was consented,
prepped, and brought down to the operating room for surgery.
Intra-operatively, he was closely monitored and remained
hemodynamically stable. He tolerated the procedure well without
any difficulty or complication. But EBL intraop 3200
mL--required significant amt. blood products and pressors.
Remains intubated.

He was sent to the SICU immediate post operatively. Pt continued
to recieve pressor and blood products. Once pt was stablaized
with the post operative support. He was extubated without
difficulty.

He was then transferred to the floor for further recovery.

On the floor, he remained hemodynamically stable with his pain
controlled. He progressed with physical therapy to improve his
strength and mobility. He continues to make steady progress
without any incidents. He was discharged to a rehabilitation
facility in stable condition.
