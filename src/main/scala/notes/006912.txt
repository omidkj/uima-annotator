Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
78 year old male with DM, AS, afib, CAD s/p CABG [**06**] years ago
presented with left sided chest pain. The patient reports that
he was sitting paying his bills today when he had sudden onset
severe [**8-10**] left sided chest pain, non-radiating, no
diaphoresis, no SOB. The pain was unrelenting; he called his
physician who advised him to call 911 and go the the ED. En
route, he received 4 baby ASA and 2 nitro sprays w/o releif. In
the OSh ED, he received metoloprolol, morphine and was placed on
a nitro drip with [**Month (only) **] in pain to [**3-12**]. EKG showed non-specific
Twave abnl. Trop reported as 6.5 and pt transfered NSTEMI. En
route, he developed increasing CP in the ambulance requiring
that the nitro be titrated up.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for dyspnea on exertion,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2102-11-7**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular
response. Downsloping ST segment depressions with T wave
inversions in leads V3-V6 suggestive of anterior myocardial
ischemia. Low limb lead voltage. Clinical correlation is
suggested. No previous tracing available for comparison.

[**2102-11-8**] CXR: Positioning is markedly lordotic making it
difficult to assess left lower lobe, but there appears to be
abnormal lung obscuring lower thoracic aorta.  Routine
radiographs recommended to distinguish consolidation from lung
mass.  Lower aspect left costal pleural margin excluded from the
examination. Other pleural surfaces are normal. Pulmonary
mediastinal vascular engorgement suggests volume overload but
there is no pulmonary edema.

[**2102-11-9**] Cardiac cath: COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominanat system

revealed three vessel natvie coronary diease. The LMCA wsa free
of
angiographically apprent CAD. The LAD was occluded proximally.
The LCX
had a high grade stenosis and a small diffusely disease AV
groove
segment. The RCA was occluded rpoximally.
2. Selective venous conduit angioography revealed a patent
SVG-OM1,
SVG-diag, SVG-RPDA with diffuse and high grade disease at the
graft
inertion site.
3. Conduit arteriography revealed a patent but diffusely disease

LIMA-LAD.
4. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP of 17 mmHg and LVEDP of 27 mmHg. There was
severe
aortic stenosis with a to peak to peak gradient of 55 mmHg, a
mean
gradient of 35 mmHg and a calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.78 cm2. The
cardiac index
5. Left ventriculography revealed a depressed LVEF of 40% and
moderate
mitral regurgitation.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent SVG to OM, SVG to diag, LIMa to LAD and evidence of
insertion
site stenosis of SVG-RPDA.
2. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
3. Severe aortic stenosis.
4. Mild systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.

[**2102-11-10**] ECHO: There is extensive calcified atheroma of the
aortic root and ascending aorta. The left atrium is mildly
dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly-to-moderately depressed (LVEF= 40 %) secondary to
hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls, and of the
apex. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. There are focal calcifications in the
aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is moderate-to-severe aortic valve
stenosis (area 1.0 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

[**2102-11-10**] Carotid ultrasound: IMPRESSION: Minimal plaque, no
internal or common carotid stenosis.

[**2102-11-10**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pneumonia.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Probable COPD.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old male with diabetes, atrial fibrillation, aortic
stenosis, and CAD s/p CABG who presents with NSTEMI.

#. NSTEMI: The patient had a TIMI risk score of 6 and ruled in
for an NSTEMI. EKG showed non-specific Twave abnormalities in
multiple leads.  He remained pain free during his first night in
the hospital, however, was maxed out on a nitro drip and
required morphine.  He was started on metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **],
loaded with clopidogrel, started on a heparin drip,
eptifibatide, and atorvastatin 80 mg.  He was continued on
aspirin.  The morning after admission he remained pain free and
the nitro drip was gradually titrated off.  He was given vitamin
K 5 mg PO in anticipation of cardiac catheterization the
following morning.  He was not immediately cathed due to an
elevated INR and he was symptomatically stable.  He subsequently
became intermittantly bradycardic to the high 40s and had a
brief episode of lightheadedness after eating lunch that
resolved with sitting up.  This was likely due to the added
metoprolol on top of long-acting verapamil.  These medications
were discontinued and he was transfered to the CCU.  Short
acting metoprolol was restarted the following day.  He underwent
cardiac catheterization  and no lesions intervenable by stenting
were found.  The patient was transfered back to the floor.  In
discussion with the patient medical management vs. redo bypass
was discussed.  Given the patient's age and other comorbiditi
