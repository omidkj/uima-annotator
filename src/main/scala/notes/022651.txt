SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  The following
information pertains to the date range of [**11-23**] to [**12-1**].

RESPIRATORY - [**Known lastname **] has been on room air since her G-tube
placement on [**11-23**].  She has not had any apneic or
bradycardic spells or desaturations on her caffeine citrate.
A follow up pneumogram on [**11-28**] was normal and showed no
apneic or bradycardic spells.

CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM -  [**Known lastname 58495**] cardiovascular status has
been stable since her G-tube placement.  She continues to
have soft intermittent murmur. Her blood pressure has been
stable, with the exception of two moderately elevated systolic
pressures (90-96 mmHg) in the 72 hours prior to discharge. A
urinalysis at that time was negative, and no further
investigations were undertaken as the finding was not persistent
and the remainder of the physical examination was within normal
limits. Blood pressure should be followed in the outpatient
setting.

FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION - [**Known lastname 58495**] PEG was placed
on [**11-23**]. Feeds were started via the G-tube on [**11-24**] and advanced to full volume by [**11-25**]. She was noted
to have some increased spits on [**11-26**].  A KUB at that
time showed some dilated loops, otherwise nonspecific.  She
is currently on total fluids at 130 cc per kg per day of 27
calorie NeoSure. She received continuous feeds at night at 90
cc per kg and bolus feeds during the day at 40 cc per kg. Her
discharge weight was 3025 grams, discharge length 46.5 cm,
and discharge head circumference 34 cm.

HEMATOLOGY - last hematocrit on [**11-25**], was 28.4.  See
summary from [**11-23**], for transfusion history.

INFECTIOUS DISEASE -  the G-tube insertion site was noted to
be erythematous on [**11-25**]. She received 24-hour course of
cefazolin for the erythema.  Her erythema has subsequently
improved but still persists on upper border of the G-tube
insertion site; the latter is thought now to be secondary to
irritation rather than infection.  Complete blood count at the
time that cefazolin was started showed white blood cell count of
12,100, hematocrit of 28.4, [**Known lastname **] count of 434 with 45
percent neutrophils and 0 percent bands. Please see summary
from [**11-23**] for description of ultrasound findings.

auditory brain stem responses.  [**Known lastname **] passed in both ears.

examination was recommended in 6 months.
