History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12795**] is a 68 year-old male with CAD s/p CABG [**2169**], COPD
on home O2, prior lung cancer (s/p RUL lobectomy), VT s/p ICD,
hyperlipidemia, type II diabetes mellitus, and atrial
fibrillation who was transferred from outside hospital for
management of hypotension. Patient presented to [**Hospital3 18201**] on the afternoon of his admission on [**4-16**] with
sytolic blood pressures in the 70's. He was intubated, given
IVF, started on levophed and dopamine, given broad spectrum
antibiotics, decadron and nebulizers. He was then sent to [**Hospital1 18**]
ED for further evaluation.
.
Per the patient's wife he was recently admitted to [**Name (NI) 29710**]
[**Date range (1) 29711**] for a COPD exacerbation requiring ICU admission but he
had not needed intubation. He was discharged on a lengthy
prednisone taper. Following discharge he remained short of
breath, wheezy, and continued to have a productive cough at
home. He also developed neck pain and shoulder pain over day
prior to this presentation. On [**4-16**] he became febrile to 101.1F.
He saw his pulmonologist in clinic [**4-16**] and was prescribed
another course of antibiotics. Then, on the way home from this
appointment he was complaining of feeling worse weakness. When
patient and wife arrived at home he was too weak to even stand
up and fell to the ground exiting the car. His wife activated
911.
.
When patient arrived to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, his pressors had been tapered
to solely levophed and systolics were in the 80's. He was
started back on neosynephrine, bolused a total of 5 liters, and
started on heparin gtt given concern for pulmonary embolism. He
was also given a dose of Cefepime and Tamiflu along with
solumedrol 125mg IV x 1. He had atrial fibrillation with RVR to
the 170's and BP again dropped to 70's. At this point levophed
was weaned down. Notably ECG showed ST depressions in V1-V4
which appeared similar to prior tracings. He was seen by the
cardiology fellow who suggested amiodarone if atrial tachycardia
recurs. Patient transferred to MICU for further management.
.
Please see hospital course details below for ICU course summary.


Past Medical History:
-Type II Diabetes
-Coronary Artery Disease:  CABG done in [**2169**], LIMA to LAD, SVG
to RAMUS, SVG to RCA. Additional PCI [**2177**]: DES placed LMCA -->
LCx, required. Required AIBP at the time.
Ventricular Tachycardia: ICD placed in [**2177**] for primary
prevention ([**Company 1543**] [**Last Name (un) 24119**] DR, a 6949 right ventricular lead.
Has PPM in place)
-Lung cancer, s/p RUL lobectomy [**2172**] chemo/rads
-COPD, on home oxygen
-Gout
-Hypertension
-Hyperlipidemia
-Atrial Fibrillation



Social History:
Patient is a retired engineer, lives with wife [**Name (NI) **] in
[**Location (un) **] MA. Prior to this admission the patient was needing
more supervision as he easily gets confused and was often
disoriented. He smoked 1PPD for nearly 45 years and quit in
[**2172**]. Rare ETOH use and no prior illicit drug use.



Family History:
Father had CABG in 60s, died at 81, mother with fatal MI at 71.
