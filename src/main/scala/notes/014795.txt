Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
Elective VT ablation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
VT ablation


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 33y/o gentleman with h/o MI in [**2109**] (proximal LAD
occlusion in the setting of cocaine) s/p thrombectomy and
subsequent ischemic CM (EF 15-20%) and ICD placed in [**2110**], who
is admitted to the CCU due to hypotension s/p VT ablation.

On [**2112-10-10**] the patient was seen at [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital after
experiencing an episode of palpitations followed by firing of
his ICD. He was found to have had an appropriate shock for VT at
220 bpm. He was also noted to have orthostatic hypotension.
Since that time, his Spironolactone has been held. He was
discharged to home without further medication changes. He was
then readmitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2112-10-15**] after complaining of
dizziness and strong palpitations while at home. Interrogation
of his device at that time did not reveal any further
arrhythmias.  Amiodarone was initiated at 200mg daily and he is
now being referred for VT ablation.  Upon interview today, Mr.
[**Known lastname **] reports feeling very anxious regarding the possibility of
further ICD firings. He describes intermittent lightheadedness
but denies any more palpitations since discharge. In addition,
he denies dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea or PND.

The patient was admitted today for VT ablation. The procedure
revealed inducible sustained monomorphic VT with multiple
morphologies.  The VT induced in the baseline state caused
immediate hemodynamic collapse, and he was cardioverted.  One
dominant VT was well tolerated hemodynamically after
administration of procainamide to slow it.  Activation mapping
revealed the apparent site of origin on the basal areal of the
anterior wall septal junction.  RF energy was delivered there
and at multiple nearby areas.  In addition, substrate ablation
was performed. He required cardioversion x 3. His ICD was
reporgrammed to include ATP pacing. The patient was given 20 mg
IV lasix in the EP lab because he was 3+ L positive after the
procedure. Post-procedure the patient's SBPs were in the 70s-80s
and he recieved a 500 cc bolus. He was transfered to the CCU for
hypotension post-procedure.

On arrival to the floor the patient reports that he feels tired,
but otherwise has no complaints. He denies CP, SOB,
palpitations, dizziness/lightheadedness.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 33y/o gentleman with h/o MI in [**2109**] (proximal LAD
occlusion in the setting of cocaine) s/p thrombectomy and
subsequent ischemic CM (EF 15-20%) and ICD placed in [**2110**], who
is admitted to the CCU due to hypotension s/p VT ablation.

# Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has a dual chamber ICD
placed in [**2110**]. Patient recently with palpitations and
appropriate shock delivered for VT. Patient admited for VT
ablation, EP procedure with successful substrate ablations to
multiple VT morphologies. Post procedure course complicated by
hypotension with SBPs to the 70s. Patient was 3+ L positive and
given 20mg IV lasix in EP lab and then became hypotensive post
procedure. The recieved a 500 cc bolus with some improvement.
Now with SBPs in 80s on arrival to CCU. Patient asymptomatic.
Baseline SBPs in high 80s-90s. The patient was monitored on
telemetry without event. The patietn's BP remained stable. He
was back to baseline SBPs by discharge. He was walked around the
unit with stable VS and without symptoms and was discharged
home.

# Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: Patient with EF of 15-20% after MI in
[**2109**], last ECHO in [**1-/2112**] still with EF of 15-20%. Patient
appears euvolemic on exam and no current symptoms of
decompensation. Home metoprolol was continued. Lisinopril was
initially held secondary to hypotension, but was restarted on
day of discharge. Of note the pt's spironolactone d/c about 1.5
weeks prior to admission by patient's PCP for orthostatic
hypotension. BY his description his NYHA functional class is
currently 2+ - he develops dyspnea and marked fatigure walking
<1 block, and doing light carrying.

#  CAD: Pt with h/o anteroseptal MI in [**2109**]/proximal LAD
occlusion s/p thrombectomy (in the setting of cocaine use) c/b
PEA arrest and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**]. No current ischemic symptoms. Home
