HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 69-year-old woman
presented with substernal chest pain and a known history of
coronary artery disease from a myocardial infarction three
years prior.  She is also a known paranoid schizophrenic.
She was admitted for substernal chest pain.  First she was
treated and managed by the Cardiology Service.

The patient came into the hospital also for cardiology workup
and also for agitation.  A Psychiatry consult was initiated
on the first day of admission.  The plan was that she would
have a CABG anticipated within the next day or two.  Her
myocardial infarction was on [**2190-12-6**] in which she
was delirious post catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Myocardial infarction.
3.  CHF.
4.  Psoriasis.
5.  Paranoid schizophrenia.
6.  Hypercholesterolemia.
7.  TIA.
8.  Osteoarthritis.
9.  Hypothyroidism.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Total abdominal hysterectomy.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to both penicillin and
codeine which gave her a rash.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Haldol 1 mg p.o. q.h.s.
2.  Metoprolol 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Levothyroxine 0.025 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Haldol was also given 1-2 mg IV as needed.
5.  Trandolapril 2 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d. p.r.n.
8.  Nitroglycerin p.r.n.
9.  Tylenol.
10. Heparin drips when she arrived to the hospital.
11. Integrelin drips when she arrived to the hospital.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has no known family nearby.  She
gets services at home.  She also had spent some recent time
at a [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation and lives at home alone.

PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 141, K 5.2, chloride
104, C02 24, BUN 53, creatinine 1.5 with a blood sugar of
126.  White count 10.3, hematocrit 32, platelet count
235,000.  The patient had an INR of 1.1.

Prior catheterization on [**2190-12-6**] showed RCA 85%,
left main 50-60%, LAD 80%, and circumflex 60% with an
ejection fraction of approximately 50%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was seen by Cardiology and continued on
her ACE inhibitors as well as her IV drips.  She was referred
to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**].

On [**2190-12-20**], the patient underwent a coronary artery
bypass grafting times four with LIMA to the LAD, vein graft
to the RCA, and a vein graft sequentially to OM and diagonal.
 She was transferred to the Cardiothoracic ICU in stable
condition.

The patient had an intra-aortic balloon pump also placed in
the Operating Room.  Initially, the right foot was a little
mottled and cool.  The Ace wrap was taken down off of the leg
and through the course of this shift, the foot pinked up and
were not as cool as prior to the shift.  The balloon pump
weaning was attempted with an index of less than 2.  The
balloon pump remained in.  The patient also had an episode of
rapid atrial fibrillation for which she was bolused for
Amiodarone.

The patient was also deteriorated to a rapid VT and into VF.
She was defibrillated with a single 360 joule shock and went
back into sinus rhythm. The Amiodarone drip was started.  The
patient continued to have peak frequent PVCs.  Electrolytes
were given as repletion.  A second bolus of Amiodarone was
also given.  There was also a right femoral hematoma but no
additional expansion was noted.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] felt that the
hematoma was post catheterization and was not new.

On postoperative day number one, the patient had received
multiple blood products for oozing and continued on
perioperative vancomycin, was on an Amiodarone drip,
epinephrine drip at 0.03, Levophed drip at 0.25, milrinone at
0.5 and a propofol drip.  The patient continued on an
intra-aortic balloon pump wean.  She was in sinus tachycardia
with PVCs in the 100s with a blood pressure of 96/54, index
of 2.57.

The patient remained intubated and sedated in the ICU.  The
decision was made with consultations to remove the
intra-aortic balloon pump.  The patient was seen by Vascular
Surgery.  There appeared to be improvement when the balloon
was removed.  The patient was still requiring pressor support
at that point.

Again, in the afternoon, the patient had some rapid atrial
flutter.  She had a single shock.  Postoperatively, the
hematocrit was 37 and BUN of 27, creatinine 1.1.  The patient
was seen by the Renal Fellow for some oliguria over the
course of several hours of the day with the suggestion that
it was probably prerenal and possibly ATN of maybe a
hypotensive insult.  The Fellow also heard a left renal
bruit.  The urine output improved later in the evening and
then dropped off again.

That evening, the diagnosis was ATN secondary to some
perioperative hypotension.  They recommended not diuresing
the patient while the patient was on pressors.

On postoperative day number two, the patient remained on an
Amiodarone drip at 1, epinephrine at 0.03 liters, 0.38
milrinone, and 0.35 propofol, heparin, and an insulin drip.
The patient's right leg was still a little bit cool.  The
patient was on low-dose heparin per recommendations.  The
patient remained sedated.  The lungs were clear.  The
incisions were clean, dry, and intact.  The right leg did not
have palpable pulses.  There was a PT pulse on the left.  The
right groin hematoma appeared to be stable.  The patient was
continued on vancomycin and continued on pressor support.

Urine electrolytes were sent off per Renal consult.  The
patient was also followed-up by the Psychiatry resident.  On
postoperative day number two, the patient was also seen by
Vascular Surgery and noted that the pulse examination was
unchanged and no evidence of compartment syndrome.

On postoperative day number three, the patient was started on
Amphojel and Kayexalate for a potassium of 5.5.  The patient
remained on insulin, heparin, Levophed, milrinone, and
Amiodarone drips.  The patient was hemodynamically stable.
The patient was A paced at 92 with a blood pressure of
121/50.  The patient remained on ventilatory support.  There
were still no [**Last Name (STitle) **] pulses in the right foot but the
right extremity color was improved.

The plan was to wean the Levophed and the milrinone as
tolerated.  The hematocrit was stable at 27.  The white count
rose to 15.  The creatinine continued to climb and was 2.9 on
postoperative day number three.  A left Quinton catheter was
placed.  The Renal Fellow came back to assess the patient
with a climb in creatinine to reevaluate chemistries.  An
attempt was started to do hemodialysis but the patient's
hemodynamics did not allow that to continue with the hope
that as the milrinone was wearing off the blood pressure
would improve and possibly trying to do CVDHD or hemodialysis
the following day.

The patient was also seen by Clinical Nutrition and followed
by the Renal Fellow.  On postoperative day number four, the
creatinine remained at 2.9.  The patient continued to be A
paced with a good blood pressure.  The chest tubes were
pulled.  The patient had some A fibrillation.  Amiodarone was
given again.  The patient remained also on a heparin drip as
well as Amiodarone, insulin, and Levophed.  The patient was
partially responsive with intermittently AV paced and had at
that point swollen extremities but biphasic PT [**Name (NI) **]
pulse on the right and the left had both DP and PT tri and
biphasic forms.

The creatinine dropped later in the day on [**2190-12-25**]
to 2.5 on postoperative day number five.  The K was 4.3,
hematocrit stable at 27.  The incisions were clean, dry, and
intact.  The patient remained on an Amiodarone drip at 1 and
a Levophed drip at 0.1.  Ventilator wean was continued.  The
heart was regular in rate and rhythm otherwise with
intermittent AV pacing with p.r.n. Lasix for urine output.
Overall, there appeared to be some improvement in the
patient's renal function and the respiratory acidosis from
the morning appeared to improve.

On postoperative day number six, the creatinine dropped to
2.0 with a K of 4.1, temperature maximum 99.9.  The patient
was AV
