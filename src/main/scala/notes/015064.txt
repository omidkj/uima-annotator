CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Seeing kids that are not there.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 60-year-old male with
multiple medical problems including diabetes, hypertension,
coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass
of hallucination.  He was evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the
Emergency Department and treated in the Neuro Intensive Care
Unit overnight.

Initial evaluation revealed a subdural hematoma on the left
frontal lobe with some mild midline shift.  Mr. [**Known lastname 100157**]
story began the afternoon of one day prior to admission when
apartment playing hide and seek and he was the leader.  He
thought that they were hiding in the bathroom and so he went
after them.  He reports slipping and falling hitting his
buttocks.  He did not remember hitting his head or losing
consciousness.  Afterwards he was took weak to get up so he
waited for his girlfriend to return home and help him.  She
found him unsteady and shaky so she brought him to the ED.

Note, he is a bit unclear of the timing of whether this was
the day after the fall or the day of the fall that he was
brought to the hospital.  He has not had any recent illness,
headache, fever, chills, changes in is vision, nausea,
vomiting, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain or
changes in his GI or GU function, or weight loss.  There has
been no weakness or numbness.

In discussion with Mr. [**Known lastname 100157**] primary physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 4036**]
Shans indicates that he has had multiple INR problems in the
past.  Furthermore, he is inattentive and has had memory
problems for some time which is not new.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease with coronary artery bypass graft
in [**2168**].
2.  Aortic bileaflet valve.
3.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30
to 35%.
4.  Diabetes mellitus.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Peripheral vascular disease with multiple surgeries.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atenolol 25 q. day.
2.  Lipitor 10 q. day.
3.  Mavik 2 q. day.
4.  Furosemide 80 b.i.d.
5.  Neurontin 400 t.i.d.
6.  Celexa 20 q. day.
7.  Zantac 150 b.i.d.
8.  Klonopin p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  None known.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Retired living with his girlfriend of 30
years.  He has an 80 pack year history of smoking.  He is now
currently smoking one pack per day since his coronary artery
bypass graft.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No stroke or seizures, but has had a
significant history of coronary artery disease, hypertension
and diabetes mellitus.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs with a T max of 100.9 F
currently 98.7 F, pulse 75 to 90, blood pressure 104/53
ranging to 157/70.  Net negative 1.27 liters.  General:
Elderly man in no acute distress.  Head and neck:
Normocephalic, no lymphadenopathy or bruits.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rhythm, normal rate.  There is a valvular murmur
during systole, mechanical.  Pulmonary:  Good air movement,
but wheezy.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds, soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  Positive pulses.

Neurological:  Awake, alert and oriented times four.
Language and comprehension are intact.  Attention is poor
with difficulty with months of the year backwards.  Memory is
therefore difficult to assess, but he recalls one out four at
five minutes.  Cranial nerves:  Pupils equal and reactive to
light.  Extraocular motions are intact, no nystagmus.  Fundi
are normal.  Fields are full.  There is a mild right facial
droop.  The palate elevates symmetrically.  Tongue protrudes
midline.  Sensation is intact in the face.  Motor:  There is
a normal tone, but left hand bulk is decreased in an ulnar
distribution.  The right deltoid is mildly weak as well as
the left interossea.  Left [**Last Name (un) 938**] is also mild to moderately
weak, otherwise motor is full throughout.  Toe are downgoing
bilaterally. Sensory:  Touch and pinprick is decreased in the
left ulnar distribution, but otherwise intact in the upper
extremity.  Sensation to touch, temperature, vibration and
pinprick were decreased from the toes to the knees
bilaterally.  Proprioception distally is decreased
bilaterally.  Reflexes are 1+ and symmetric.  Toes are
downgoing bilaterally.  Coordination:  Finger to nose is
intact.  Heel to shin is intact.  Gait:  Not tested.

LABORATORY:  White count 6.6, hematocrit 31.3, platelets 178,
INR 1.6, sodium 139, potassium 3.7, chloride 97, bicarbonate
34, BUN 26, creatinine 1.2, glucose 202, calcium 8.6,
magnesium 2.5, phosphorus 3.7.

IMAGING:  CT Scan of the head reveals a left frontal subdural
hematoma with some mild mass affect.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted initially to the
Neuro Intensive Care Unit where he had frequent neuro checks.
A repeat head CT Scan was stable and therefore he was
transferred out to the Neurology floor.  His initial
presentation is one of hallucination and a left frontal
subdural hematoma in the setting of high INR.  It is
difficult to attribute hallucinations to a subdural bleed and
it is likely that hallucinations may be secondary to his
narcotic use.  There is also a concern of infectious
etiologies given his asterixis and fever.  Work up while in
house revealed a MRSA urinary tract infection and this will
be treated with Vancomycin.  Over the following day, his
asterixis improved as well as his mental status.

At the time of discharge, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was clinically stable
and appropriate for discharge.  He will stay off Warfarin for
three weeks because of this hemorrhage, but then at that time
he will restart anticoagulation.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Improved.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged home with follow up.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Left frontal subdural hematoma in setting of high INR.
2.  Hallucinations with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus urinary tract infection.
3.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft.
4.  AVR requiring Warfarin.
5.  Congestive heart failure.
6.  Hyperlipidemia.
7.  Diabetes.
8.  Hypertension.
9.  Significant peripheral vascular disease.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atenolol 25 q. day.
2.  Lipitor 10 q. day.
3.  Mavik two q. day.
4.  Lasix 80 b.i.d.
5.  Neurontin 400 t.i.d.
6.  Celexa 20 q.d.
7.  Zantac 150 q. day.
8.  Klonopin p.r.n.
9.  Warfarin to be restarted in two weeks' time.

FOLLOW UP:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] will follow up in Stroke [**Hospital 878**]
clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
