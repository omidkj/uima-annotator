Chief Complaint:
palpitations x1 week

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardioversion for Aflutter


History of Present Illness:
62 yo male with history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin
presenting with palpitations for one week. He reports being on
amiodarone through [**Month (only) 404**] of this year, but then stopping it
until the past three weeks. Three weeks ago, he resumed his
prior amiodarone dose of 200mg daily. He reports one week of
palpitations, DOE, and diaphoresis with any exertion. He
eventually presented to the ED with presyncope and diffuse
weakness. In addition, he reports one episode of left sided
nonradiating chest pain that was self limited after last 10
minutes. He reports PND without orthopnea. He also reports a
ferocious appetite without any weight gain.
.
Returning to [**Hospital1 614**] on Friday, and has a follow up
appointment with his cardiologist next Monday. He reports being
followed in a coumadin clinic, but notes his last INR was 1.1 on
[**1-26**], at which point they kept his dose at 5mg.
.
In the ED, Initial Vitals: 98.3 78 129/88 16 100% RA

===================
EKG: There appears to be atrial flutter with variable block.
Intraventricular conduction delay. Non-specific ST-T wave
changes. No previous tracing available for comparison.
===================
TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
=====================
CXR:
Cardiomegaly is substantial, unchanged. Mediastinum is
unremarkable. Lungs are essentially clear with no evidence of
pulmonary edema or increased in pleural effusion. Pneumothorax
is not seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo M with hypetensive cardiomyopathy presented with dyspnea
on exertion, found to be in aflutter, cardioverted but course
complicated by myocardial stunning.
.
1. Atrial Flutter: The patient was cardioverted out of atrial
flutter into NSR after a TEE did not demonstrate intra-atrial
clot. Post-procedure, the patient developed hypotension and
bradycardia requiring atropine and dopamine for pressor support.
 This likely developed in the setting of anesthesia, and
multiple medications given during his rapid ventricular rate
(diltizem and beta blockers).  Additionally, the patient
developed a similar reaction while cardioverted in the past.  In
the CCU, the patient was gradually weaned off dopamine. He
remained in sinus with a short run of NSVT noted on telemetry
overnight.  It was recommended that the patient's primary
cardiologist in [**Hospital1 614**] consider ablation to prevent future
episodes of atrial flutter.  Additionally, amiodarone was
recommended at 200mg daily.  The patient did not exhibit signs
of heart failure. The patient will need to remain on coumadin
for at least 1 month after cardioversion.
.
2. Hypertensive Chronic Systolic Failure: TTE here showed
moderate MR, global LV hypokinesis, and an EF 25-35%. The
patient had previously been on lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **], diltiazem,
spironolactone, and coreg. These medications were held in the
setting od the patient's recent hypotension and bradycardia. The
patient should be restarted on these medications as an
outpatient. Also, the patient should be started on an ACEI if
indicated as determined by the patient's PCP/Cardiologist.
.
3. Elevated Glucose: A1C of 6.4% on admission labs. This should
be followed as an outpatient.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Adjust patient's HF medications. These were held on discharge
due to recent hypotension.
- Add an ACEI
- Establish cardiology follow-up
- Control sugars
- Discuss role for aflutter ablation in the near future

Medications on Admission:
Warfarin 5mg daily
Diltiazem 30mg tid
Amiodarone 200mg daily
