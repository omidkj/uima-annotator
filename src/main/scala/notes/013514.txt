History of Present Illness:
Mrs.[**Known lastname **] is a 82 year old female with a PMHx significant for
Alzheimer's dementia, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension,
and multiple admissions for ascending cholangitis who was
transferred from OSH for hypotension.  The patient received
bactrim for a UTI at her [**Known lastname **].  On the day of admission, she had
a fever with altered mental status.  She was taken to an OSH and
received levaquin.  She was found to have a systolic BP in 70s,
fluid responsive.  CT head was negative.

Of note, the patient has had several admissions over the last
3-4 months for ascending cholangitis s/p [**Known lastname **] with
sphincterotomy and CBD stent in [**11-20**], treated with 14 day
course of Zosyn-->CTX, s/p percutaneous cholecystostomy on
[**2187-1-15**], and repeat [**Date Range **] wtih stent removal and sludge/stone
extraction and double pigtail CBD stent placement on [**2187-2-22**],
treated with 10 day course of CTX-->cefpodoxime and flagyl for
C. Diff.  Patient was planned to have a cholecystectomy this
week.  On the last admission, palliative care was consulted.
She was made DNR/DNI and transitioned to hospice care.

In the ED, VS were:  T103, HR 106, 78/40, 16, 98% on 2L.
Patient was lethargic, oriented to self only.  She received CTX
and also had a CT abdomen that showed possible cholangitis.  Pt
has had known chronic acalculous cholecystitis, s/p perc
drainage.  Surgery evaluated the patient and did not feel the
gallbladder was the source of the sepsis.  She also received
Zosyn.  She was also found to have a DVT and was started on
heparin gtt.  She was hypotensive to BP 70/41.  A RIJ was
placed.  Currently, VS are BP 113/50 on levophed 0.06, HR 102,
RR25, 100% on 2L.  Pt received a total of 5L of NS.  UOP of
750cc.  Discussion between ED and family was that pt will be
FULL CODE for now until further discussion.

[**2187-3-28**] 4:11 am MRSA SCREEN      Source: Nasal swab.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2187-3-30**]**

   MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2187-3-30**]):
      POSITIVE FOR METHICILLIN RESISTANT STAPH AUREUS.

Imaging:
CXR [**3-27**]:
IMPRESSION: Interval development of mild interstitial pulmonary
edema and
small left pleural effusion. Retrocardiac opacity likely
represents a
combination of hiatal hernia and adjacent atelectasis.

CT abd/pelvis [**3-27**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Markedly abnormal appearance of the gallbladder with grossly
abnormal
contour and pericholecystic inflammatory changes. Findings are
concerning for acute cholecystitis with likely gangrenous
component, though no definite pericholecystic fluid collections
are seen.
2. Deep venous thrombosis extending from the left common iliac
vein into the left common femoral and superficial femoral vein,
incompletely imaged
distally.
3. Small fluid collection along the greater curvaure of the
stomach is of
unclear etiology. The sequela of prior pancreatitis is a
possible, albeit
unlikely, possibility.
4. Endplate irregularity at T12/L1 is likely secondary to
degenerative
changes. MRI can be pursued if there is concern for diskitis.
5. Small nodular lesion appearing to arise from the right ovary
is
incompletely evaluated. Ultrasound can be pursued if clinically
indicated.
6. Small bilateral pleural effusions.

Echo [**3-28**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is dilated.  LVEF >65%. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area
1.0-1.2cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
