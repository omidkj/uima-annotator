.
CT head: Cytotoxic edema in the inferior left temporal lobe,
concerning for subacute infarction in the left MCA distribution.

2. Extensive periventricular white matter hypodensities,
consistent with chronic microvascular infarctions. 3. Bilateral
multiple lacunar infarctions.
.
CXR: 1. Findings consistent with left lung
consolidation/collapse, with possible underlying pleural
effusion.
2. Increased interstitial markings, enlargement of cardiac
silhouette and upper hilar redistribution, likely representing
congestive heart failure and interstitial edema.
.
CT Chest [**12-25**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Diffuse bilateral airspace disease, pleural effusions and
ground-glass opacities consistent with ARDS.
2. Extensive anasarca of the subcutaneous soft tissues.
3. Moderate amount of free fluid within the abdomen and pelvis.
4. Diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
5. Compression fractures of L1, L5 and T10.
.
CT Head - [**12-25**]
Evolution of left temporal infarct and interval development of
several additional bilateral subacute infarcts as described
above. Etiologies include multiple embolic infarcts versus
watershed infarcts. If clinically warranted, MRI could be
helpful for further evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 80 yo F w/ parkinsons, h/o stroke, carotid artery stenosis
s/p CEA presents with cough, lethargy found to have b/l
infiltrates c/w ARDS and CT head with multiple left-sided
infarcts.  Patient completed 10 day course vanc, zosyn, levo.  4
days post treatment had sputum positive for pan-resistant
psudomonas minimally sensitive to zosyn and amikacin.  Started
on zosyn. trached and pegged at Day 14.  Was preparing for
discharge to rehab when desatted acutely.  Hypotensive and
bradyacrdic responding to pressors and atropine.  Worsening
respiratory effort with Cheynes- [**Doctor Last Name **] breathing.  Discussion
has with family and decision made to change goals of care to
Comfort Measures Only.
.
# CMO - after discussion with daughter, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 70969**].
Patient's code status was changed from full code to comfort
measures only.  Patient passed away at 1:30am.
.
# PNA/ARDS: CXR with b/l consolidation, s/p appropriate course
of vanc(to level), levo, and zosyn. Given respiratory
instability and large consolidation, covered broadly without
microbial data to guide treatment. Sputum gm stain [**12-19**] showing
sparse MSSA, re-cultured [**12-21**] negative.  CT chest [**12-25**] shows
dense consolidation and ARDS. Patient with mucous plug on [**12-27**]
resulting in hypoxia to 80% and bradycardia, improved with
bronchoscopy.  Sputum culture [**1-1**] growing pseudomonas,
sensitivities pending. CXR showing increasing Left sided
infiltrate. Patient oxygenating well, appears more comfortable
on MMV.
- patient scores a 1 on VAP protocol but started on empiric
antibx [**2-17**] low UOP, episodic hypotension and temp to 100.2
- pseudomonas sensitive to zosyn and amikacin only, will start
zosyn and d/c meropenem
- daily CXR
- PEEP to 5 on PS
- switched to AC [**2-17**] Cheynes-[**Doctor Last Name **] breathing
.
# CVA: pt. with h/o CVA. On aggrenox for left carotid stenosis
s/p CEA. Now with head CT- showing multiple left-sided strokes.
Unable to asses on physical exam.  Patient remains minimally
responsive with sedation removed >5 days
- f/u with neuro, can consider MR to r/o brainstem infarct,
however, even if demonstrates devastating infarct, family does
not wish to alter course of management and wish to pursue trach
and peg
.
# History of Decreased urine output - have been diuresing
patient for last several days.  For the most part, SBPs have
been above 100.  Not likely due to hypotension but may be an
early indication that the patient is infected.
- 1L bolus NS:PRN
- follow I/O's closely
.
# ARF: Per daughter no prior hx, likely [**2-17**] dehydration. Cr
improved now.
.
# elevated troponin: elevated in setting of ARF. Trended down.
No concerning findings on ECG.
- no further workup neccessary.
.
# anemia:  Per PCP note, hct has been steadily decreasing (35 in
[**6-22**]). Pt. has refused EGD.  HCT stable at 23.  will transfuse
for HCT<21. Iron studies, folate b12, retic c/w anemia of
chronic disease
- follow H&H
- transfuse prn
.
# Parkinson - Continue home regimen Carvidopa-Levidopa.
.
# F/E/N: IVF boluses for decreased UOP. Replete lytes PRN.
Concentrated TF.
.
# PPx: Bowel regimen to daily stools, PPI, sq Heparin
