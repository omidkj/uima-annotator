Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2145**]
Chief Complaint:
Right foot ulcer getting worse

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Incision and drainage, right foot with amputation of right
hallux.
Repeat incision and drainage, right foot


History of Present Illness:
65 year old male with type 2 diabetes, HTN,
Hypercholesterolemia, CAD and history of remote stroke, current
smoker, who was brought to the [**Hospital1 882**] ER by his brother
secondary to concern about the state of his R foot.  They
transferred him to [**Hospital1 18**] as he gets all of his podiatric care
here with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He has had chronic diabetic foot ulcers
of both feet, most recently a persistent ulcer on the plantar
surface of the 1st metatarsal for the last few months.  He has
been non-weight bearing on his R foot for at least the last
month, however he admits to walking on it recently.  His brother
says the ulcer has gotten progressively worse, with a foul odor.
 His R leg has also gotten progressively more swollen over the
last week.  He was scheduled for pre-operative evaluation with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**5-22**], with surgery planned for [**5-29**].

At [**Hospital1 882**] his vitals were 102.0, 110, 100/60, 95% on RA.  His
labs were notable for a WBC of 14 with 9% bands, as well as Na
of 129, K 5.2, BUN 12, creat 0.6.  He received vancomycin and
zosyn, and was seen by surgery who recommended transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]
for probably surgery.

In the ED here his vitals were 101.3, HR 113, 95/palp, 14, 95%
RA.  He was given vancomycin and clindamycin.  A L IJ was placed
after unsuccessful attempts at a SC, and code sepsis was called.
 His CVP was 5.  He received 6L NS in the ED, and was started on
a levophed drip.  He was seen by podiatry who are planning on
taking him to surgery within the next couple of days pending
"medical stability."

The patient denies fevers, but thinks he's had some "sweats"
over the last week.  He says he's been feeling otherwise well.
Denies any lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain.  He gets
shortness of breath when going up a flight of stairs.  At
baseline he says he can walk around without difficulty and go up
stairs without difficulty.   He does not exercise.


Past Medical History:
1) Type 2 DM, with neuropathy, complicated by chronic diabetic
foot ulcers secondary to plantar flexed first metatarsal for
which he has multiple antibiotic courses.
2) HTN
3) Hypercholestremia
4) CAD
5) CVA [**95**] years ago, on ASA and plavix since
6) Carotid enderectomy
7) Status post cholecystectomy, appendectomy.


Social History:
Patient is separated from his wife for the last 10 years,
currently living with his brother.  They have 5 children, some
of which are in the area.  He says he just quit smoking
yesterday, but has smoked 1/2-1 PPD x 50 years.  He used to
drink heavily, about a 6 pack on the weekends, but is in AA and
has been sober x 10 years.  Denies IVDU.


Family History:
Mother and father both had DM, both deceased.  Father with MI at
60 and PVD.  Mother had a stroke.


Physical Exam:
100.4, 95, 99/69 MAP 79, CVP 10, RR 22, 94% RA.
I/O:  6214/280.
Gen:  Overweight caucasian male appearing slightly disheveled.
Conversant.  AAO x 3.  Foul smelling.
HEENT:  Dry MM.
Neck:  JVP at 10 cm.
Cor: RR, normal rate, 2/6 systolic murmur at LSB without
radiation.
Lungs:  CTA b/l, no w/r/r.
Abd: NABS, soft, large oblique scar in RUQ, vertical scar in
RLQ.
Extr:  2+ pitting edema of R leg up to mid-tibia.  Erythema of
RLE up to ankle.  L foot with strong DP/PT pulses, diminished
sensation, no active ulcers.  On plantar aspect of R 1st
metatarsal there is a 2-3 cm ulcer with purulent base, marked
surrounding edema and erythema, and foul smelling odor.

Pertinent Results:
R foot plain film:
TWO VIEWS RIGHT FOOT: Deformity and cortical irregularity of the
distal first metatarsal is unchanged. Well-healed osteotomy of
the mid shaft of the second and fourth metatarsals. Improved
appearance of resected distal third metatarsal. Soft tissue
abnormality on the plantar aspect of the foot. There is slight
hallux valgus deformity.
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged appearance of cortical irregularity of the first
metatarsal head. No adjacent subcutaneous emphysema noted.
2. Soft tissue defect noted on the plantar aspect of the foot.
.
R foot plain film, post-amputation:
RIGHT FOOT, THREE VIEWS: Comparison with [**2192-5-12**]. There has
been interval amputation of the first great toe from the distal
portion of the first metatarsal. There is accompanying soft
tissue loss. The third distal metatarsal is noted to be
resected. Well-healed second and fourth metatarsal osteotomies
again noted.
IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of osteomyelitis after great
toe amputation.
.
PA/Lateral CXR:
PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Right PICC tip is
demonstrated within the proximal right atrium. The heart is
normal in size. The aorta is tortuous. An opacity is present
within the medial right upper lobe, in the right suprahilar
region, which appears to have been present dating back to
[**2189-2-18**]. Although this could represent overlapping
shadows, an underlying mass cannot be fully excluded. The lungs
are otherwise clear. There is no effusions or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:
1. Right PICC tip in the proximal right atrium. Findings
discussed with the IV nurse at 3:30 p.m., [**2192-5-16**].
2. Opacity in the right suprahilar region, which may represent
overlapping structures, but an underlying mass cannot be
excluded. Chest CT is recommended for further evaluation.
.
Chest CT:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of significant mediastinal or
hilar lymphadenopathy. No pericardial or pleural effusion.
Coronary arteries are extensively calcified. Note is made of
aortic wall calcification.
In the lung window, note is made of mild paraseptal emphysema.
No evidence of consolidation is noted. No nodule or mass is
identified. No endobronchial lesion. Note is made of somewhat
distorted architecture of the right middle lobes as well as
major fissure on the right, with atelectasis in the medial
aspect. Right upper lobe bronchus is not identified. Somewhat
prominent fat in the mediastinum. These findings may contribute
to the opacity seen on prior chest x- ray. Pleural calcification
on the right.
In the visualized portion of the upper abdomen, note is made of
calcified granuloma. Note is made of bilateral adrenal nodule,
measuring 2.3 cm on the right and 1.5 cm on the left, with
Hounsfield units up to 30, of indeterminate character.
There is no suspicious lytic or blastic lesion in skeletal
structures.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of mass or consolidation. Somewhat distorted
appearance of the lung architecture of the right upper chest,
which may somewhat contribute to the finding on chest x-ray.
Right upper lobe bronchus not identified. Is this patient post
right upper lobectomy?
2. Bilateral adrenal nodule as described above, of indeterminant
characteristics, probably hypertrophy. Please correlate with
clinical history, and if necessary, please evaluate by adrenal
MRI.
3. Extensive coronary artery calcification and aortic valve
calcification.
4. Pleural calcification on the right.
