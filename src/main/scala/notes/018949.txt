Endotracheal intubation.

History of Present Illness:
77M PMH myelofibrosis and resulting anemia at hematology clinic
the day of admission for his first ever blood transfusion for
hematocrit 19. The transfusion was started at 10:50 am. He was

juice per notes. The patient states that he frequenly aspirates
"but it's always ok." Patient sent to the ED for further
evaluation.

abdominal ultrasound
.
FINDINGS: Liver is markedly enlarged, measuring approximately 17
cm. There is a small, 1.7 x 1.6 cm simple cyst seen in the
periphery of the right lobe of the liver. Adjacent to this is a
small well-circumscribed lobulated echogenic lesion measuring
2.3 x 1.9 cm, which appears most consistent with a hemangioma.
Smaller cyst and adjacent 1-cm similar echogenic lesion most
consistent with hemangioma are also seen in the medial aspect of
the right lobe of the liver. There is no biliary ductal
dilatation. There is a small amount of ascites seen around the
liver, and in the lower pelvis. Gallbladder, and pancreas are
unremarkable. Spleen is markedly enlarged, measuring 17.5 cm.
The right kidney measures 10.9 cm. The left kidney measures 11.1
cm. Large simple cyst is seen in the right kidney measuring 3.7
x 2.0 x 3.4 cm. A smaller adjacent 1.7-cm simple cyst is also
seen in the mid pole of the right kidney. Both kidneys are
otherwise normal in appearance, without evidence of mass, stone,
or hydronephrosis.

Note is made of marked enlargement of the prostate, which
protrudes into the posterior aspect of the bladder.

Main portal vein is patent, with appropriate antegrade flow.

IMPRESSION:
1. Marked hepatosplenomegaly.
2. Multiple liver cysts and likely hemangiomas.
3. Small volume ascites around the liver, and in the lower
pelvis.
4. Right renal cysts.
5. Marked prostatic enlargement, bulging into the posterior
aspect of the bladder.
.
TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The interatrial septum is
aneurysmal. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler (does not exclude). The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-10mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate to severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension most likely due
to a primary pulmonary process. Interatrial septal aneurysm.

VIDEO SWALLOW
INDICATION: 57-year-old man with Zenker's diverticulum and
aspiration pneumonia.

COMPARISON: Not available.

FINDINGS: Oropharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was
performed today in corroboration with speech pathology. Various
consistencies of barium were administered.

ORAL PHASE: Bolus formation, control, AP tongue movement, and
oral transit time within functional limits.

PHARYNGEAL PHASE: Swallow initiation, palatal elevation,
laryngeal elevation, laryngeal valve closures, and epiglottic
deflection were within functional limits. Pharyngeal transit and
bolus propulsion was within functional limits. No residue was
seen in the valleculae or piriform sinuses immediately after the
swallow. However, there was a significant backflow from a large
diverticulum below the upper esophageal sphincter to the
piriform sinuses.

ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: No penetration or aspiration during the
swallow, however, penetration was seen after the swallow from
backflow from the diverticulum to the pharynx.

AP position images demonstrate large collection in the midline
with air-fluid level, which could represent known Zenker's
diverticulum.

IMPRESSION: Penetration resulting from backflow from the large
esophageal diverticulum, likely Zenker's, otherwise functional
oral and pharyngeal swallow. The diverticulum could be formally
evaluated with barium swallow if clinically indicated and no
prior studies performed.

# Aspiration pneumonia
Pt developed fever, bandemia, bilateral infiltrates on CXR in
the setting of a witness aspiration event during blood
transfusion.  Approximately 50 cc of cranberry juice was
suctioned out of him at the time, and he was admitted for
hyxpoxia.  On the medical floor he triggered for sudden episode
of hypoxia and required intubation in the MICU for < 24 hrs.  He
was extubated and transferred to the medical floor.  He was
considered to have aspiration pneumonia, however trali and
transfusion related volume ov
