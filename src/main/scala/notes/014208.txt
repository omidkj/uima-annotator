Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9240**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia, edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old man with baseline dementia who was brought
in by his daughter from home for a distended and painful lower
abdomen, increased pedal edema, shortness or breath, and
decreased urinary output over the past 3 days. The patient lives
at home with around the clock care and his daughter had been
notified of a general functional decline over the past 3 weeks.
The patient had become more withdrawn, almost completely
nonverbal, and unable to feed himself. On the day of admission,
one of his caretakers notified his daughter of the fact that he
seemed uncomfortable, dyspneic, and that his UOP was decreased,
and his daughter brought him to the [**Name (NI) **] for evaluation and
treatment. EMS gave the patient nitro and 40 mg Lasix en route.
In the ED, his vitals were T97, HR in the 70s, BP 140/80, RR 16
and he was satting 98% on 3 L n/c. A Foley was put in and the
patient immediately drained over 1 L tea colored urine. A set of
labs revealed that the patient was hyperkalemic to 6.4, and his
creatinine was 7.8 (we have a value of 0.9 in [**2129**], pt not known
to have RF). His BNP was elevated ( 9553) He was given calcium
gluconate, 10 units insulin, 1 amp D50, and ceftriaxone, and
then transferred to the ICU.
.
He rapidly diuresed with steady improvement in his creatinine,
allowing transfer to the floor [**4-22**] in stable condition. He is
slowly becomine more arousable and appears to be symptomatically
improved. Urology consultation did not appreciate significant
prostate enlargement. Renal ultrasound was essentially normal
with an 8.2cm R renal cyst. The daughter's goal is to get him
home with goal of comfort.

Past Medical History:
CAD, s/p CABG
HTN
Hypercholesterolemia
S/p right parotidectomy
Melanoma (back, resected 27 years ago)
Bilateral Cataracts, s/p resection
Primary Thrombocytopenia
severe dementia

Social History:
The patient has dementia, lives alone with a caretaker around
the clock. His daughter visits him frequently and his health
care proxy. [**Name (NI) **] alcohol, tobacco or drugs.

Family History:
Noncontributory

Physical Exam:
VS T 96.8  HR 71  BP 102/53  RR 16  Sat 99% on 3 L n/c
GENERAL: Frail elderly man in bed, breathing comfortably,
nonverbal.
HEENT: Minimal pupillary reaction to light. Unable to test EOM.
Neck: JVD is present. No masses.
CHEST: Fine crackles both lung bases, decreased respiratory
sounds throughout.
CV: RRR. Normal S1 and S2. A [**2-3**] holosystolic murmur is heard
throughout precordium, radiating to axilla.
ABDOMEN: NTND. BS present.
GU: A Foley is in place. External genitalia grossly normal.
EXT: Edema is present to hip, 3 pitting edema R>L. Also sacral
edema.
NEURO: Patient unable to cooperate

Pertinent Results:
[**2133-4-20**] CXR: Accounting for the poor inspiratory effort on the
exam, no definite pneumonia or CHF.
.
[**2133-4-20**] ECG: Technically difficult study
Regular rhythm consider accelerated idioventricular rhythm
Left axis deviation
IV conduction defect
QT interval prolonged for rate
Lateral ST-T changes
Since previous tracing of [**2128-6-14**], P wave discernible, QRS wider

Clinical correlation is suggested
.
[**2133-4-21**] ECG: Regular rhythm - consider accelerate
idioventricular rhythm
Left axis deviation - possible left anterior fascicular block
Extensive ST-T changes
QT interval prolonged for rate
Since previous tracing of [**2133-4-20**], no significant change
.
[**2133-4-22**] RENAL U/S: 1. No obstruction or stones were seen.
2. Simple cyst in the upper pole of right kidney measuring 8.2
cm in greatest dimension.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) ARF: His baseline creatinine is not known, but the patient
does not have a hx of renal failure. His RF is likely postrenal,
as placement of a Foley resulted in immediate output of >1 Liter
urine. In the unit, postobstructive diuresis yielded>2 Liters
urine output in the first two hours. Urology was consulted and
proscar and finasteride were started for possible BPH. Urology
felt he would need Foley drainage for at least 2 weeks following
his severe retension. He was discharged home with Foley and 24h
care. His Cr was back down to 1.0 on discharge.

2) EDEMA: The edema was likely secondary to his obstructive
renal failure. The patient has been diuresing with no need for
lasix. Edema had almost completely resolved on discharge.

3) HYPOXIA: He does have some fluid overload on CXR, however he
is not dyspneic now and is breathing comfortably on 2 L n/c. No
signs of consolidation. Sats remained stable.

4) ALTERED MENTAL STATUS. The patient has dementia at baseline
and is essentially nonverbal. His functional decline over the
past three weeks was most likely [**1-30**] to uremia in the setting of
his renal failure.

5) CHF. The primary insult seems to have been the renal failure
causing fluid overload. On exam, the patient does not have an
S3.Edema had resolved on discharge.

6) FEN.
- Ground pureed diet, thick liquids.
- All pills crushed.

9) COMMUNICATION
With daughter [**Name (NI) 14880**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 110324**]

10) DNR DNI: discharged home with 24h care.
