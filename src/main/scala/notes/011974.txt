History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 53yo male with hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites,
encephalopathy admitted on [**2147-5-16**] with abdominal pain [**1-10**] SBP,
treated with ceftriaxone.
.
Patient was admitted on [**2147-5-16**] with a variety of abdominal
symptoms. He developed melena on [**5-17**] and was transferred to the
MICU for EGD, which demonstrated Grade II esophageal varices
that were banded x 2. Patient started on octreotide gtt,
pantoprazole and sucralfate. His Hct remained stable on [**5-18**] so
he was called out to the floor.
.
On [**2147-5-19**], he developed sudden onset of large rectal bleed,
found to have lost about 900cc of venous blood. Hct dropped from
30.5 to 21.5, and was transferred back to the MICU for further
management of this GI bleed.  In the ICU, he intubated for
emergent EGD, which showed frank blood in the esophagus.  He
underwent urgent TIPS, with transhepatic gradient decreasing
from 28 mmHg to 10 mmHg.  Following procedure, the patient has
not had a recurrence of UGIB.  He was extubated following
improvement in his mental status.  However, mental status
continued to wax and wane, and he was treated for hepatic
encephalopathy with lactulose.
.
Prior to transfer, pt is tolerating lactulose well.  Trauma line
has been removed this morning after Hct has been stable at 28-30
for greater than two days.  He states he felt weak with
abdominal discomfort during his UGIB.  He denies abdominal
pain/lightheadedness/weakness currently.  Also denies chest
pain/SOB.  No n/v/d/f/c.  Last BM one hour ago, loose, light
brown, non-bloody, no melena.
.

MR abdomen:
IMPRESSION:

1. Evidence of hepatic cirrhosis and portal hypertension, with
moderate
ascites, paraesophageal varices, and marked splenomegaly.
2. No focally arterial enhancing lesion is identified within the
liver
parenchyma. No other hepatic parenchymal lesion is seen to
correlate with
finding on prior ultrasound study [**2147-4-24**]

Renal u/s
IMPRESSION:

1. Moderate right hydronephrosis with no identified cause. No
hydronephrosis on the left.

2. Moderate amount of ascites.

Abdominal ultrasound:

COMPARISON: Comparison is made to prior ultrasound performed
[**2147-5-17**].

FINDINGS:
A moderate amount of ascites is identified. A site suitable for
percutaneous aspiration of ascites was marked on the right lower
anterolateral abdominal wall with patient supine and probe held
perpendicular to the skin surface.

The TIPS is patent, with wall-to-wall flow on color imaging. The
TIPS has a flexed appearance. The peak velocity at the proximal
end of the TIPS is 93 cm/sec, and at mid TIPS 120 cm/sec. There
is elevated velocity at the distal portion of the TIPS with peak
measurement 151 cm/sec. Appropriate reversed flow is identified
within the left branch of the portal vein. There is probable
slow reverse flow in the anterior right portal branch, but
Doppler tracing is suboptimal, probably as the vessel is
diminutive in size as demonstrated on MR study [**2147-5-16**]. The
gallbladder is mildly distended with echogenic debris in its
dependent portion. No intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation is
seen. The common bile duct is normal in caliber. No other focal
parenchymal abnormality is identified in the liver. The
pancreatic head and body appear unremarkable, but the pancreatic
tail is not fully visualized. The spleen is markedly enlarged
measuring 19.0 cm bipolar diameter. Small bilateral basal
pleural effusions are seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. Site suitable for aspiration of ascites marked on right lower
anterior  abdominal wall as indicated above.
2. Patent TIPS, with flexed appearance and elevated flow
velocity at its  distal portion. Short interval followup is
advised.











Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 53 yo male with hepatitis C cirrhosis, ascites,
encephalopathy admitted on [**2147-5-16**] with abdominal pain secondary
to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, treated with ceftriaxone,
with hospital course complicated by esophageal variceal bleed x
2.

MICU Course- Patient transferred to the MICU for EGD on [**2147-5-17**].
EGD showed grade II varices with cherry red spots, likely
bleeding from esophageal varices.  Performed band ligation x 2.
Also has portal gastropathy.  Patient placed on octreotide gtt
and sucralfate.  Remained hemodynamically stable while in the
MICU.  Called out to floor on [**2147-5-18**]

MICU Course II- Patient transferred back to the MICU with
massive GI bleed on [**2147-5-19**].  Massive transfusion protocol was
initiated and he received 11U PRBCs as well as multiple units of
FFP and platelets.  He underwent urgent EGD which showed a
bleeding gastric varices.  Once stablized, he underwent TIPS
procedure with resulting drop in portal pressure from 28 to 10.
He remained intubated until [**5-21**].  Tolerated
