Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pressure, STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with drug eluting stent to the left
anterior descending artery


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 42 yo M with no significant PMH who presented to
[**Hospital1 **] with 1 hr [**9-22**] CP. He had been feeling well until he
after he dropped his daughter off at school and he began
developing chest pressure. At first, he thought he was having
gas but then the chest pressure persisted and he developed
shortness of breath. He also felt nauseous but denies vomiting.
He denies radiation of the pain to the arms or jaw. He denies
headache, lightheadedness, palpitations. His wife drove him to
the [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **].

In the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], his ECG showed diffuse ST elevations, highest
in precordial leads. He received aspirin 325 mg po, plavix 600
mg, heparin bolus and drip, sl ntg x 1. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.
On review of systems, he had a cold last week with mild cough.
He denies fever, chills, rigors. he denies any prior history of
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Imaging:
cardiac cath: [**2138-3-3**]
The LAD was identified as the culprit for the STEMI. We seated a
6Fr XBLAD3.5 guide and crossed with a prowater wire. We
performed several passes with an Export catheter. We then
predilated the lesion with a 2.5x12mm apex balloon and stented
with a 3.0x33mm Cypher. We post dilated with a 3.25x20mm Quantum
apex balloon. Final results showed no evidence of dissection, no
residual lesion and TIMI 3 flow. Right femoral angiography
revealed good sheath placement. An angioseal closure device was
used. The patient was transferred to the CCU in stable
condition.
COMMENTS:
Successful primary PCI to proximal LAD lesion with DES.
Aspirin and Plvix 75mg daily for 1 year.
Consider PCI of the RCA if positive outpatient stress test or
recurrent
angina.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Primary PCI to proximal LAD lesion.

ECHO: [**2138-3-3**]
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the
anterior septum and anterior wall and near akinesis of the apex.
The remaining segments contract well (LVEF 40%). No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Transmitral and tissue
Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with regional
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD (mid-LAD distribution). Mild mitral
regurgitation with normal valve morphology.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 42 yo male with no significant PMH who presented to
[**Hospital3 **] ED with 1 hour with chest pain found to have
STEMI and 100% proximal occlusion in LAD now s/p DES to mid LAD.


1. s/p STEMI: presented to ED less than 1 hr after onset of
symptoms and was rapidly started on ACS protocol (ASA, plavix
load, heparin gtt) with emergent cardiac catheterization.  EKG
showed diffuse STE, predominantly in precordial leads suggesting
a "wrap around LAD".  During catheterization, had a DES placed
in 100% occlusion in LAD, also noted to have significant CAD in
other vessels which were not intervened upon given STEMI.
Patient tolerated procedure well with no complications, with
groin site appearring c/d/i and no post-procedural chest
discomfort.  Cardiac enzymes were trended and peaked with CK-MB
of 392, trop 8.51. Transaminases were initially elevated thought
[**1-15**] to acute MI and trended down by time of discharge.
Hemoglobin A1C was within normal limits and peri-MI lipid panel
revealed LDL of 111 with HDL of 153.  Post-procedure, patient
was maintained on ASA, plavix, atorvostatin, metoprolol and ACEI
(titrated captopril which was changed to lisinopril prior to
discharge).  Echo revealed apical akinesis, severe hypokinesis
of the distal half of the anterior septum and anterior wall with
EF of 40%.  Patient was started on coumadin with heparin bridge
with plan for anticoagulation for 3 months.
