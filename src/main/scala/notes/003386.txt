Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
Burning chest pain and shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Dialysis
Removal of tunneled dialysis catheter


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 61 yo F w/ CAD s/p MI (in [**2-3**]) and previous 2 stents in
RCA and LAD, scleroderma, HTN, ESRD on HD MWF ([**12-28**] scleroderma)
s/p transplant x2 currently failing with initiation of dialysis
since [**Month (only) 205**], and systolic HF (EF 20-25%) who comes in with
substernal, burning chest pain that feels like "fire." She
reports this pain has been ongoing and intermittent for months,
and has been occuring every night for the past few weeks. She
notes this pain only occurs at night and begins after she lays
flat to sleep. She reports that it is exacerbated by food. She
finds herself having to sit almost upright to help relieve her
pain. She has tried antacids, maalox, and omeprazole with no
relief. She has also tried nitroglycerin which will relieve her
pain for about 1/2-1 hour, but then the pain returns. She has
requested oxygen at her last two dialysis sessions which helps
her and she usually feels better after her HD sessions. She also
has associated dyspnea along with the pain that is much improved
with oxygen and sitting in an upright position.
.
Of note, she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] last in [**6-4**] w/ pulmonary
edema and dyspnea, had a tunneled IJ line placed and was
initiated on dialysis in the setting of her renal transplant
failure and volume overload. She was intubated for respiratory
distress and had good relief with lasix gtt with return of
adequate oxygen saturations on room air. She was discharged on
furosemide 80mg [**Hospital1 **] but reports now that she does not make any
urine, a few drops if any.
.
She was evaluated by PCP for this chest pain most recently 5
days ago. He noted that she hasn't had any weight changes nor
increase swelling in her BLEs. He believes chest pain is GI in
origin patient is scheduled for outpatient endoscopy for further
evaluation this Thursday along with treatment with omeprazole.
.
In the ED, vitals 97.1 104 118/65 22 97%. CXR with pulmonary
edema, EKG with LAD, IVCD without changes compared prior.
Patient started on CPAP in ED given tachypnea was unable to wean
off. Vitals prior to transfer HR: 91, 100% on Bipap, BP 107/66.
Pt arrived to the CCU floor on a NRB, but then slowly
transitioned to 4L NC w/ oxygen saturations 92-95%. Pt felt
comfortable as long as she was sitting up straight and felt
better with the oxygen.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

MICROBIOLOGY
[**2204-9-10**] MRSA SCREEN: No MRSA isolated
.
IMAGING
[**2204-9-10**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): There is bilateral diffuse
reticulonodular opacity in the lower lung fields and
ground-glass haziness. These findings are compatible with
pulmonary edema. Dialysis catheter is in unchanged position with
tip seen in the distal SVC/cavoatrial junction. Cluster of
calcifications in the right mid lung are unchanged. The aorta is
tortuous and calcified. There is mild cardiomegaly. No definite
pleural effusions are seen.
.
[**2204-9-11**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
inferior akinesis and near akinesis of the distal half of the
septum and
