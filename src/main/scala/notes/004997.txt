[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
74 year old woman with elevated d-dimer.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please use visipique- d/w radiology resident; r/o pe
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Elevated D-dimer.

COMPARISON: [**2112-3-22**].

TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced axial CT imaging of the chest with
multiplanar reformats was reviewed.

CTA CHEST WITH CONTRAST: No filling defects are present within
the pulmonary arteries. The aorta and great vessels of the
mediastinum are unchanged. There is a moderate-to-large
pericardial effusion that is unchanged in size. Enlarged
mediastinal lymph nodes are unchanged. Previous bypass surgery
and right RCA and LAD stents are present. There are
emphysematous changes of the lungs and small bibasilar
atelectasis and bilateral pleural plaques. Previously identified
nodules are not as well discerned on today's study. The trachea
and airways are patent to the subsegmental level. The upper
images of the abdomen demonstrate previous liver transplant and
marked splenomegaly.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence for PE.

2. Chronic pericardial effusion, moderate-to-large in size.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2112-3-24**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Normal regional LV systolic function. TVI E/e' >15,
suggesting
PCWP>18mmHg. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Borderline normal RV
systolic
function.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
to moderate
[[**12-7**]+] TR. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS. Significant PR.

PERICARDIUM: Moderate to large pericardial effusion. Effusion
echo dense, c/w
blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. Effusion is
loculated.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the
presence of elevated
right sided pressures. Sgnificant, accentuated respiratory
variation in
mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, c/w impaired ventricular
filling.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is a moderate
to large sized pericardial effusion. The effusion is echo dense,
consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
The effusion appears loculated. In the subcostal view, the RV
appears compressed - this suggests either localized tamponade or
technical artifact. Overt echocardiographic signs of tamponade
may be absent in the presence of elevated right sided
pressures/pulmonary  hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2112-3-24**],
the effusion appears similar in size. The apopearance of
compression of the distal RV free wall in the subcostal view
appears more prominent.

IMPRESSION: Large, loculated pericardial effusion. Pulmonary
hypertension. Possible, localized tamponade.
