Chief Complaint:
N/V/Hypotension/Upper GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper endoscopy x 2
intubation/extubation

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 104301**] is a 85 year-old female with hx of dyphagia and
aspiration s/p G-tube placement 1.5 months ago sent in from
[**Known lastname **] to the ED with hypotension, nausea, and vomiting.  She
had been in rehab for a month after her G-tube placement until 2
weeks prior to this presentaiton.  She presented to [**Known lastname **] on
the day of admission with decreased intake via PEG tube
secondary to nausea.  She states she had slightly decreased
intake the day prior to admission, but became extremely nauseous
the day of admission and could not tolerate intake through her
G-tube.  She denies abdominal pain, bright red blood in her
stool, or melena.

In the ED, initial VS: BP 75/40.  She was guaiac negative on
exam.  Surgery was consulted and evaluated her.  She was noted
to have bright red blood from the G-tube when it was flushed.
Her Hct was in the mid 20's (from mid to high 30's).  GI was
contact[**Name (NI) **] and plan to scope once in the MICU.  She was started
on a prontonix gtt.  She has two PIVs (20-guage) placed.  She
was given 2 L NS and ordered for 1 unit of PRBC.  Right as she
was going to be taken up to the MICU, her pressure dropped to a
SBP of 60.  She was symptomatic.  She was laid flat with
improvement to 79/44.  Her unit of PRBC had just been started
when her pressure dropped.  She was also nuaseous and was given
some zofran.  A third liter of NS was started.  Most recent
pressure prior to transport was 91/38.

When the patient arrived in the MICU peripheral levophed was
running.  She was maintaining BP in the 90's.  She denied pain.

On ROS she denies fevers, chills, dizziness, CP, shortness of
breath, dysuria or other symptoms.

EGD [**1-30**]:
Stomach:
 Contents: Red blood was seen in the stomach. Large clots
present in fundus below GE junction. PEG site with balloon
[**Month/Year (2) 48613**] without active bleed or [**Month/Year (2) **] from site. Despite
lavage for over two hours unable to clear field for optimal look
at fundus. Potential ulceration on greater curvature but unclear
and no visible vessel or active bleeding from that site. Clot
re-formed after suction given active bleed.

Impression: Blood in the stomach
Blood in the duodenum
Blood in the esophagus
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

EGD [**1-31**]:
Stomach:
Excavated Lesions A single cratered [**Month/Year (2) **] was found in the
fundus just distal to GE junction at the greater curvature
across from the ballon, which appeared to be the source of
bleeding. Dimensions 2cm x 4 cm. No visible vessel or active
bleeding therefore no intervention performed. Small amount of
red blood in stomach. No [**Month/Year (2) **] beneath PEG site.
Duodenum:
Other Small amount of old blood seen in duodenum.

Impression: [**Month/Year (2) **] in the fundus just distal to GE junction
Small amount of old blood seen in duodenum.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

CXR [**2-17**]: Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.
Persistent
left lower lobe collapse and adjacent small left pleural
effusion. Linear
atelectasis present at right base with otherwise clear
appearance of right
lung.


Brief Hospital Course:
#  Upper GI Blood:  Patient has a baseline Hct in the high 30's
(most recently in [**Month (only) **] during her recent hospitalization it
was in the mid 30's).  On admission Hct of 26 which was an acute
decline.  Guaiac negative on rectal exam, however bright red
blood was noted to come from the G-tube concerning for an upper
GI bleed.  She was admitted to the MICU.  Prior to admission,
she became hyotensive to the ED requiring levophed.  EGD in the
MICU initially showed voluminous bleeding.  Her hematocrit
continued to fall to as low as 19.  Massive trasnfusion protocol
was activated.  The patient received 9 units packed RBCs, 2
units FFP, 1 unit of platelets, and 4 L NS.  Her hematocrit
stabilized and levophed was weaned as she was volume
resuscitated.  Patient received several units prbcs and GI was
consulted and performed EGD which revealed large clot in the
fundus just distal to GE junction with pulsation seen near the
clot and oozing. PEG site with no evidence of bleeding. She was
initially on a protonix gtt and then transition to PPI [**Hospital1 **] with
planned 8 week course. Overnight on [**2-5**] she was noted to have
hypotension and tachycardia in the context of bright red blood
output per her G-tube.  Her HCT dropped from 39 to 31 and she
became tachycardic and hypotensive.  In this context she had
altered mental status with confusion and delirium.  In the ICU a
subclavian line was placed as peripheral access was lost.  The
patient was evaluated by IR, surgery, and GI and sent to the IR
suite for further management.  In the IR suite she had
embolization of her left gastric artery, which was bleeding,
leading to her stabilization. She subsequently had a stable hct
with several days of melena but no bright red blood per rectum
or g-tube. She is continued on lansoprazole 30mg [**Hospital1 **]. In total
she required 6U PRBCs, but has not required a transfusion for
over a week at the time of discharge.

# Respiratory Failure: Patient was electively intubated for EGD
because had had difficult EGDs in past. She remained ventilated
for one day and then was extubated on [**2113-2-1**]. However, in the
second admission to the ICU, on [**2-6**] pt was found to have a PEA
arrest requiring rapid reintubation. Pt subsequently had
difficulty with extubation requiring increasing pressure support
and having difficulty producing ne
