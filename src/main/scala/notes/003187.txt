Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the inferoseptal, anteroseptal,
anterior and anterolateral walls. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 6. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including Milrinone and
Norepinephrine, Epinephrine and is being AV paced.
1. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is well seated. No [**Male First Name (un) **] is
seen. Trace MR is seen. Mean gradient across the valve is 8mm of
Hg with a CO of 5.5.
2. LV function is slightly improved. RV function is preserved.
3. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
4. Other findings are unchanged

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2152-1-23**] 3:01 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluation of effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
78 year old woman with s/p mvr, cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluation of effusion
CLINICAL INDICATION: Evaluate for effusion.

FINDINGS: Two views of the chest were obtained and compared to
the prior examination dated [**2152-1-20**]. There are persistent
bilateral pleural effusions that have slightly decreased since
the prior examination. There is a persistent left retrocardiac
opacity likely secondary to underlying atelectasis, although a
superimposed pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. The patient
is status post mitral valve replacement, CABG and median
sternotomy. The cardiac silhouette is slightly less prominent as
noted on the prior examination.

IMPRESSION: Minimal interval decrease in size of bilateral
moderate-sized pleural effusions. Otherwise, no significant
interval change.
