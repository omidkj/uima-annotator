Brief Hospital Course:
55 yo male with h/o Hep C, EtOH abuse, on methadone with active
IVDU who presented with UGIB and lactic acidosis.
.
1) UGIB:
EGD demonstrated 4 cords of grade III varices in lower [**12-23**] of
esophagus and a normal duodenum. 5 bands were successfully
placed. Patient then received a total of 4 units PRBCs and 1
FFP, and Hct remained stable at ~34. Patient was started on IV
protonix and octreotide gtt for 48 hours. Diet was advanced to
liquids and was transferred to the floor. While on the floor,
patient did not have any further episodes of bleeding and was
hemodynamically stable. Patient was scheduled for re-banding
procedure on [**2150-7-10**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**].
.
2) Cirrhosis and ascites:
Patient presented to the hospital with a history of EtOH abuse
and hepatitis C. Ultrasound showed evidence of cirrhosis. Labs
demonstrated undetectable HCV viral load, although patient was
HCV Antibody positive. To further evaluate etiology of
cirrhosis, patient was tested for qualitative HCV to determine
low levels of HCV, alpha 1 antitrypsin, and Hepatitis B PCR,
which were still pending as of discharge. During the admission,
patient had greatly increased ascites resulting in stomach
discomfort and nausea. For initial treatment of ascites, patient
was started on diuretic therapy on [**2150-6-29**] with spironolactone
and furosemide.
.
3) Klebsiella Bacteremia
During this admission, patient was found to have blood culture
positive for pansensitive Klebsiella and treated with
levofloxicin for 2 weeks. Patient has been afebrile for the
length of his stay and surveillance blood cultures have been
negative.
.
4) Ileus
Patient also developed an ileus on [**2150-6-30**] with greatly
distended bowel, abdominal discomfort, and shortness of breath
which resolved with enemas and NGT placement. Patient slowly
progressed from being NPO to a regular diet.
.
5) Shortness of Breath:
Patient developed acute shortness of breath during admission
secondary to bilateral PEs confirmed on CTA. Patient was
anticoagulated with IV heparin drip and then converted to
lovenox. Patient's SOB was further compounded with abdominal
distension secondary to ileus and fluid overload. Patient was
discharged with lovenox and will be converted to coumadin at
outpatient.
.
6)Lactic acidosis:
Patient's lactic acidosis was likely secondary to reduced
cardiac output in hypotension and quickly resolved after
transfer from MICU to floor.
.
7) Diabetes mellitus:
Patient presented with elevated sugars on admission which was
corrected and then remained under control with insulin sliding
scale.
.
8) Prophylaxis: PPI, pneumoboots
