Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2127-7-4**]: Open reduction internal fixation, left ulnar.


History of Present Illness:
69 yo male with hx CAD s/p cardiac arrest with ICD placement in
[**2125**], NSTEMI [**4-14**], chronic afib, chronic systolic HF (EF 25-30%
[**4-14**]), DMII, HTN, hyperlipidemia who fell off a stool while
painting. Patient hit his head with possible loss of
consciousness. Patient was seen at [**Hospital3 4107**] where he
underwent imaging and was found to have a minimally displaced
left proximal ulnar shaft fracture. Patient had skin abrasions
and lacerations near the site of the fracture. There was some
concern for compartment syndrome or open fracture so pt was
started on antibiotics and then was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for
evaluation. Head CT in the ER was negative for intracranial
hemorrhage.
.
Pt was evaluated and admitted by the Orthopedic Service and
underwent an [**Hospital1 24785**] on [**7-4**]. Pt was stable immediately after the
surgery but became diaphoretic, weak, hypoxic to 81% on RA and
acutely short of breath on the morning of [**7-5**].  A trigger was
called, and pt was transferred to the CCU for treatment of
presumed acute on chronic systolic heart failure in the setting
of peri-operative volume overload.
.
At baseline, pt reports being about to walk 50 yards before
tiring and becoming short of breath, can climb approximately 1
flight of stairs. He has not had any angina since [**Month (only) 547**] (left
shoulder pain)and no orthopnea or PND at baseline. HE has mild
chronic LE edema. No bleeding trouble onaspirin, Plavix, and
dabigatran (for atrial fibrillation).
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He does endorse leg cramping when walking. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 69 yo male with hx CAD s/p cardiac arrest with ICD
placement in [**2125**], NSTEMI [**4-14**], chronic afib, chronic systolic
HF (EF 25-30% [**4-14**]), DMII, HTN, who is s/p [**Month/Year (2) 24785**] of a left ulnar
fracture complicated by acute exacerbation of chronic systolic
heart failure and development of left-sided partial
ophthalmoplegia.
.
#Left ulnar fracture s/p [**Name (NI) 24785**] - Pt had a successful repair of
his ulnar fracture on [**7-5**]. The arm continues to heal well.
Orthopedics surgery will follow-up as an outpt for repeat
imaging to assess progress of healing.
.
#Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure - Pt became tachypneic
and hypoxic the day following his surgery, triggering a rapid
response on the floor. CXR at the time showed signs of pulmonary
edema consistent with an acute exacerbation of heart failure. In
the perioperative period pt received ~6L fluid which was the
likely cause of his fluid overload. Concern for ACS or PE in the
perioperative setting was less likely, but pt was maintained on
anticoagulation with heparin gtt until ruled out. Pt was
transferred to the CCU for aggressive diuresis with lasix IV. He
was diuresed well and his hypoxia and shortness of breath
resolved.
.
#?Minor Stroke v Neuropathy - On [**7-6**], pt began noticing new
onset double vision and his wife confirmed that his "eyes were
looking in different directions." On neurologic exam, pt was
found to be unable to adduct his left eye though all other
extraocular movements were intact. Pt said the double vision had
gradually been worsening over the previous two hours. Range of
motion was intact in his right eye though with some nystagmus on
horizontal eye movement. His neurologic exam was otherwise
non-focal with no other cranial nerve defects, no mental status
changes, no changes in reflexes or muscle strength.
