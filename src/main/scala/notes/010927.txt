ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-3-9**],
the findings are similar.

Video Swallow:
PHARYNGEAL PHASE: Limited evaluation due to patient positioning
and poor
visualization of the structures. However, pharyngeal phase
demonstrated mild residue in the valleculae after puree and
solid boluses which cleared with sips of liquid. Pharyngeal
phase was within normal limits for swallow
initiation, palatal elevation, laryngeal valve closure,
epiglottic deflection, and bolus propulsion. Please note,
piriform sinuses or upper esophageal sphincter was not imaged.

AP POSITION: Not able to be obtained.
ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: Laryngeal penetration of thin liquids
via teaspoon
and aspiration of thin liquids via straw occurred due to
premature spillover. Patient had coughing which cleared
aspirated material.
IMPRESSION: Mild oropharyngeal dysphagia as described above.
Please see
speech pathology note for further details.

CXR:
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2143-2-1**]
obtained at 03:40 a.m. The heart size is normal. Mediastinal
position, contour and width are unremarkable. Slight worsening
in bibasilar opacities might represent worsening of atelectasis,
although bilateral, in particular on the left aspiration cannot
be excluded. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  No
evidence of failure is present. Followup with chest radiograph
to exclude the possibility of worsening basal pneumonia is
recommended.

LENI:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 58yo man w hc chronic progressive MS, quadriplegia, hx
aspiration PNA, chronic foley who was transferred from OSH ED
with increasing fatigue and productive cough.
.
# Progressive fatigue and cough - Patient had recently been in a
hospital and was still being treated with cefpodoxime and flagyl
for a presumed aspiration pneumonia.  There was a concern for a
worsening pneumonia and was changed to levo flagyl until his
cultures were negative.  He was then changed back to
cefpodoxime/flagyl and completed his ten day course while in
house.  He was seen by speech and swallow who recommended that
his liquids be thickened.
.
# Cards: He has hx of chronic diastolic CHF. EKG without
ischemic changes. Pt without chest pain. Troponin elevated but
CK normal.  His troponin continued to be high.  This was thought
to be related to demend ischemia in the setting of labile
hypertension.
.
# HTN: Continue coreg but at 1/2 dose. Continue clonidine.  His
blood pressures were difficult to control and at times he
required extra doses of hydralazine to bring his blood pressure
down.  No hypertensive medications were changed.
.
# MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] of seizures: Continue lamictal. Recently titrated
off of keppra. He had a [**Last Name (Titles) 862**] in house and neurology was
consulted.  They recommended adding back keppra and increasing
the dose of lamictal.  This was done and he can continue to have
his keppra taper and increase lamictal as outpatient.
.
# Resp: continue nebs. BiPAP at night for OSA
.
# Autonomic Dysfunction: hx of labile BPs. Monitor and continue
meds as above.
.
# Lower Extremity Edema: Pt has chronic LE edema. His lasix were
initially held in the setting of concern for an infection.  They
were restarted and he was discharged
