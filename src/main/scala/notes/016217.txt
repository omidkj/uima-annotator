[**2156-3-31**] with a catheterization at [**Hospital6 **]
Hospital with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
and stent of the distal saphenous vein graft to the right
coronary artery and congestive heart failure with ejection
fraction of 15% with an echocardiogram in [**2156-5-31**] showing
myocardial infarction 3 to 4 Class, presented to an outside
hospital on [**7-6**] with severe shortness of breath and four
to five days of dyspnea on exertion, unable to walk two steps
with mild mid sternal chest discomfort, 2 out of 10, no
nausea and vomiting, no diaphoresis, no radiation.  The
outside hospital's troponin 1 was 2.47.  He was started on
Dopamine and Amrinone drip for low blood pressures and
congestive heart failure.  He was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for cardiac catheterization.
Intra-aortic balloon pump was placed prophylactically.  His
saphenous vein graft to diagonal was patent with back filling
of the left anterior descending.  His saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal was patent with moderate disease of the left
circumflex obtuse marginal after graft insertion.  His
saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery had a 99%
lesion.  Intervention percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty with cutting balloon and stent was placed for
proximal plaque shifting in the right coronary artery.  There
were no complications.  His brachytherapy was unavailable at
that time.  It was postponed for the next day.  As the
patient has Plavix allergy he was started on Ticlid 250 p.o.
b.i.d., Integrilin for 18 hours and his Coumadin was held.
he was transferred to CCU.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Also significant for automatic
implanted cardioverter placement in [**2153**] for cardiac arrest,
benign prostatic hypertrophy.  He is allergic Plavix and
Iodine gives him a rash, Procainamide with unknown reaction
and he has question of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia per
the patient with his platelets coming down to 90 in [**Month (only) 116**] and
returning up above 100 in [**Month (only) **].  He has a remote smoking
history, one pack per day times 15 years.  He does not drink
alcohol.  No illicit drug use.

40 q. PM, Zestril 20 q.d., Toprol 12.5 q.d., Lipitor 10 q.d.,
Coumadin 2 q.d., Proscar 5 q.d.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for positive paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, positive orthopnea, recently sleeping
seated.  No fevers and chills.  No nausea and vomiting.  No
melena, no bright red blood per rectum, no easy bruising, no
epistaxis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination his temperature was
96.0, blood pressure 78/52, heartrate 78, respiratory rate
17, 99% on room air.  He was on an intraaortic balloon pump
of 1:1 and generally comfortable in no acute distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat, pupils equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Anicteric sclera.
Mucous membranes moist.  Neck, jugulovenous pressure greater
than 15 cm.  Lungs, clear to auscultation anteriorly.
Decreased breathsounds at bases.  No crackles, wheezes or
rhonchi.  Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm, normal S1
and S2, positive S4, II/VI holosystolic murmur at the apex
radiating to the axilla.  Abdomen, soft, nontender,
nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities, left
groin with intraaortic balloon pump, no bleeding, no
hematoma, right groin no bleeding, no hematoma.  Bilateral
lower extremities, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  They are
cool with 2+ posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.  Skin, left arm with petechiae, no other
petechiae on abdomen, legs, below tongue, soft palate.
Neurological, alert and oriented times three.

LABORATORY DATA:  Complete blood count showed white blood
count of 7.7, hematocrit 38.6, platelets 118.  Chem-7, sodium
136, potassium 4.3, chloride 101, bicarbonate 25, BUN 56,
creatinine 1.6, glucose 141, calcium 8.9, magnesium 2.3,
phosphorus 3.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Balloon pump was discontinued.  Amrinone
drip was discontinued.  The patient was brought back to the
Catheterization Laboratory on [**7-9**] for brachytherapy,
tolerated without complications.  The patient was transferred
to Far 3 as he was stable.  Of note, on Telemetry there were
several episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia with
up to 21 beats at a time.  The patient was symptomatic with
some dizziness, but was not shocked.  This decreased over
night on [**7-10**], he only had as many as 2 premature
ventricular contractions at a time.  On [**7-11**], Lisinopril
2.5 q.d. was started.  The patient had a physical therapy
consult and was able to walk, was stable and ready for
discharge.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged home with home oxygen at night.
