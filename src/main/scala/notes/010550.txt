Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5084**]
Chief Complaint:
refractory epilepsy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2167-8-13**]: Left craniotomy left temporal lobectomy


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 805**] is a 42yo gentleman who has been followed by
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as an epileptologist for several years now and also
had a VNS placed, which has not given him much relief of his
seizures, which are located by several different convergent
pieces of data including imaging and physiological EEG
monitoring studies to be in the left temporal mesial area.  He
is a good candidate for a standard left temporal lobectomy, but
he was worried previously about speech or language difficulties
following surgery.  He has progressed with his refractory
seizure picture and has reached a point where he feels that it
would be better for him to undergo the surgery at this point,
especially with the lack of benefit from the vagus nerve
stimulator.  We
talked about whether this would be left in or not.  My
recommendation would be to leave it in but turn it off following
the surgery and leave it off until we can assess the overall
outcome from the resective surgery itself.  I went over the
risks and benefits and details of this with him and we will plan
a left
temporal lobectomy with an amygdala hippocampectomy in the
standard way

Past Medical History:
Refractory temporal lobe epilepsy
Depression
Asthma
Kidney stones
s/p T11-T12 and L5-S1 spinal fusion

Social History:
divorced, lives alone, no tobacco/etoh/drugs. works as a speech

Family History:
There is no family history of epilepsy or febrile seizures. His
paternal uncle has [**Name (NI) 3832**] syndrome, his maternal grandfather
had an MI at ages 50 and 70, his mother has breast cancer.


Physical Exam:
At time of discharge:
moves lle/lue spontaneously, r hemiplegic, no spon movement
rue/rle. no w/d to pain but has sensory in R side. speech
improving, able to say name and answer simple questions with
yes/no


Pertinent Results:
[**8-13**] NCHCT: Status post left temporal lobectomy. Hypodensity
within the left inferior parietal and occipital lobes suggests
edema; infarction cannot be excluded.

[**8-13**] EEG:This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study
because of
the presence of slowing broadly present broadly over the left
hemisphere and loss of fast frequency predominantly in the
mid-posterior temporal region on the left. There were a few
bursts of generalized slowing suggesting some deep midline
compromise. No interictal or sustained epileptic activity was
seen.

[**8-13**] CTA Head:
1.  Hypodensity in the left occipital lobe with cutoff of the
left posterior cerebral artery just distal to the P1 segment.
These findings may reflect occlusion of the posterior cerebral
artery with developing infarct in the occipital lobe.

2.  Expected postoperative changes status post left temporal
lobectomy, with slightly increased hemorrhage within the
surgical cavity.

[**8-13**] MRI Brain:
1.  Acute infarct in the left occipital lobe and left thalamus
as well as
within the posterior limb of the internal capsule, corona
radiata and insula. The extent of findings is less than on the
CT; CT findings may therefore reflect a combination of edema and
post-operative swelling.
2.  Expected postoperative findings of left temporal lobectomy,
with
hemorrhage within the operative bed.

[**8-14**] CT Head:
1. Loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction and hypodense left
occipital lobe consistent with evolving, known left PCA infarct.
2. New
moderate to severe left cerebral edema with effacement of the
left lateral
ventricle and new midline shift to the right by 7 mm.

[**8-14**] EEG:
This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because of
asymmetric background with relative slowing over the left
centro-temporal
regions with loss of faster frequencies temporally suggestive of
focal
cortical dysfunction. There are intermittent bursts of
generalized slowing
suggestive of some deep midline compromise. No interictal or
electrographic seizures are seen.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2167-8-18**]
1.  Interval enlargement of the large acute infarction in the
left cerebral hemisphere, as detailed above, with increased mass
effect and rightward shift of midline structures.
2.  The temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle has
slightly increased in size, likely due to increased compression
of the third ventricle, concerning for impending trapping.
3.  Small foci of hemorrhagic transformation in the left
thalamus, and
possibly also in the left occipital lobe.  However, the left
occipital
hemorrhagic focus may be chronic.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2167-8-22**]
1.  Evolving left PCA infarction with increased hypodensity
involving parietal lobe, occipital lobe, and thalamus.  Mixed
density in the left occipital lobe may represent hemorrhagic
conversion.
2.  Stable shift of midline structures to the right,
approximately 5 mm.
Quadrigeminal plate cistern remains patent

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS [**2167-8-22**]
No evidence of DVT in either left or right lower extremity.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was electively admitted and underwent a Left craniotomy and
left temporal lobectomy. Surgery was without complication. He
was extubated and upon awakening was noted to be aphasic and to
have right hemiplegia. He was taken for a stat Head CT and then
was transferred to the ICU. CT was concerning for possible
infarct so a Stroke Neurology consult was called. They
recommended EEG, CTA and MRI. These were all performed. The
patient was reintubated [**8-13**] PM due to poor neurological exam
and airway protection. CE's remained negative.

On [**8-14**] his R pupil was noted to be dilated to 8mm but still
reactive. He was given a dose of decadron and it came down to
5mm while the left remained at 4mm. Repeat Head CT revealed L
PCA infarct, new L edema with MLS & mass effect.  Family was
updated. On [**8-15**], a swallow evaluation was ordered. On [**8-17**],
patient expressed sucidial ideations and psych was consulted.
They recommended increasing his zoloft dosing and add remeron
qhs. Swallow evaluation resulted in "sips" of small spoonfulls
of nectar thick liquid as tolerated w/ 1:1 sitter. Continue
non-oral means of nutrition, meds and hydration. MRI head was
performed which confirmed L hemispheric infarct.

On [**9-19**], no changes were seen in patient. He remained in
ICU awaiting a floor bed. On [**8-20**], patient was transferred to
the floor. On [**8-21**], calorie counts were started to evaluate
patient's food intake and necessity for PEG. Patient has low
urine output and received 500cc bolus of NS. U/A was sent and
was positive for UTI, he was started on ceftriaxone.

On [**8-22**], patient removed dophoff and attempts to replace were
unsuccessful. While attempting to give POs, it was noted that
patient was pocketing food and aspirating. Chest x-ray was done
which revealed atelectasis and question of new L retrocardiac
opacity. Patient was made NPO and speech and swallow was
reconsulted. On [**8-23**], patient continued to be agitated. On [**8-24**],
patient reported abdominal pain in which GI was consulted for.
He was started on emperic treatment for [**Female First Name (un) **], if no success,
then he would need an EGD.

On [**8-25**], patient reported severe itching, he was prescribed
benadryl and sarna lotion to help relieve these symptoms.
Dilaudid was also discontinued for fear of adverse reaction.
LFTs were ordered while patient on fluconazole.

On [**8-26**] his diet was advanced. A family meeting was held and
rehab placement was discussed. On [**8-27**] his affect was improved
and more interactive. Gabapentin was increased per Neurology's
recommendations.

On [**8-28**] he was seen and examined and his speech was slightly
improved. The Neurology team also evalauted him and agreed that
his exam has improved gradually. He was screened for reh
