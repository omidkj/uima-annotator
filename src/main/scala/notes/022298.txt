Imaging:
Head CT [**10-21**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. New left cerebellar mass with possible hemorrhage.
2. Midline shift and tonsillar herniation.

Head CT
[**11-2**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. 2.4 x 1.5 cm left cerebellar mass. No significant change in
mass effect.
2. Right frontal ventriculostomy tract.

Head CT [**11-4**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable size of ventricles since yesterday's scan.
2. Well-circumscribed hypdodense area in right frontal gyrus
immediately
adjacent to burr hole, slightly more prominent today, most
likely related to tract of ventriculostomy.


Abdominal Plain Film [**10-22**]:
A SINGLE VIEW OF THE ABDOMEN demonstrates surgical clips, likely
related to
prior vascular procedure, projecting over the L3 vertebral body.
Bowel gas
pattern is unremarkable. Soft tissues and osseous structures are
otherwise
unremarkable.

CT Torso [**10-23**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Large paraesophageal/subcarinal mass, with mass effect on the
left
mainstem bronchus, and associated post-obstructive atelectasis
of the left
lower lobe, progressed from [**2161-9-28**], concerning for
either a
malignancy of bronchial or esophageal origin as noted
previously. Lymphoma is less likely.
2. Interval increase in size of numerous mediastinal nodes,
compatible with
disease progression.
3. Right lower lobe ground-glass opacities, with scattered
nodular ground-
glass opacities bilaterally, slightly improved from prior study.
4. Small pericardial effusion.
5. Cholelithiasis.
6. Left renal cysts.
7. Left adrenal fullness, unchanged from as far back as
[**2158-9-15**].
8. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.

MRI [**10-23**]:
Left cerebellar 2-cm enhancing lesion, most likely due to
metastasis. Mass
effect on the fourth ventricle. No hydrocephalus.
Mild-to-moderate brain
atrophy.

EKG [**10-23**]:
Sinus tachycardia. Left atrial abnormality. Low limb lead
voltage.
ST segment depressions in leads I, aVL and V5-V6 suggest the
possibility
of anterolateral ischemia. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2161-10-21**]
the lateral ST segment depressions are new.


Brief Hospital Course:
81M with known lung mass for which was reportedly refused workup
for greater than 1 year, PET +, likely adenocarcinoma, recent
admission for post obstructive pneumonia with increasing size of
mass seen on chest CT scan, to undergo bronch next month.
Was complaining of headache, some n/v last week, now resolved,
seen in office this morning, head CT today showed a preliminary
read of Left cerebellar mass with mass effect on the 4th
ventricle and possible tonsillar herniation. Neurosurgery
consulted to evaluate mass. He was admitted to the NSURG ICU for
a period of time for close monitoring. He underwent MRI imaging
with further identified the lesion within the cerebellum.  He
uneventfully underwent Stereotactic third ventriculostomy to
facilitate CSF drainage and avoid progressing obstructive
hydrocephalus. He also had a CT of the torso which identified a
hilar mass causing some degree of stenosis on the pulmonary
system.  He underwent a bronchoscopy for biopsy of said lesion
and pulmonary stent placement. Pathology of the bronchoscopy has
revealed small cell carcinoma. In subsequent days, there was
some drainage noted around the third ventric site.  This was
initially conservatively managed, but later came to require
perioperative wound revision. On [**11-4**], Mr. [**Known lastname 75361**] had an
excessively prolonged coughing fit, and subsequently coughed up
his stent.  When he was taken back to the OR for cranial wound
revision, interventional pulmonology concurrently replaced the
pulmonary stent.
Post operatively, he is completely stable, without any focal
neurological deficits. he is scheduled for whole brain radiation
to be conducted on an outpatient basis with follow up scheduled
in the brain tumor clinic and with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He was also
given instruction to follow up with interventional pulmonology
with regards to the stent.
