Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9853**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

hemodialysis, [**2155-4-2**]

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4702**] is a 34 yoM with a PMH significant for ESRD and
difficult to control hyptertension who presented to the ED with
two days of left-sided chest pain, found to be hypertensive. The
pt reports he was in his usual state of health until two days
ago. After HD this past Monday, he noted the onset of a sharp,
deep, aching pain in the left side of this thorax. The pain
radiates slightly to the left shoulder and upper abdomen. The pt
cannot recall whether it began abruptly or gradually; it has
progressed in severity since its initial onset and now comes in
waves of severity, [**9-6**] at it's worst. In terms of associated
symptoms, the pt notes that he has been coughing since his HD
session with producting of a small amount of white sputum. He
has also felt somewhat nauseated.
.
On arrival to the ED tonight, initial vitals were 98.5, 117, 26,
197/134, 97% RA. The pt was noted to be writhing in pain on his
stretcher. A CTA of the chest was obtained which was negative
for PE or dissection. A labetalol drip was started for suspected
hypertensive emergency. The pt's pain was treated and controlled
with dilaudid (3 mg), [**Month/Year (2) **], Zofran and Morphine (6 mg). The pt is
now admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for ongoing evaluation and managment.
.
On arrival to the floor, the pt is in moderate discomfort, but
denies any acute symptomes. His pain is improved and he is
breathing comfortably.
.
On ROS, the pt denies any history of trauma to his thorax. No
fevers or chills. No pain elsewhere in the chest or abdomen. No
dysuria, constipation or abnormal bowel movements.

.
Chest CTA ([**2155-4-2**])
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus. No aortic dissection.
2. Diffuse ground-glass opacity with air trapping at bases
suggests small
airways disease and/or poor respiratory effort. Mild pulmonary
edema.
3. Right chest wall collaterals suggest stenosis, occlusion of
the right
subclavian vein.
4. Persistent coronary artery calcifications.
5. Stable appearance of calcified right renal mass.
6. Pulmonary hypertension given enlarged diameter of pulmonary
artery.
7. Dilated ascending aorta, stable from prior.
8. Stable cardiomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
34 yoM presents with hypertensive urgency/emergency and left
sided chest pain.

## hypertensive urgency/emergency: Occuring in the setting ESRD.
Although pt endorsed medication adherence, and denies use of
recreational drugs, either of these could contribute to his
current presentation. Pain is also likely an important factor.
BP was well-controlled with a labetalol gtt on arrival to the
MICU, and the drip was able to be rapidly weaned. Unclear that
pt has actually had end-organ damage from elevated BP, thus will
view this presentation as hypertensive urgency. He was called
out to the medical floor where he underwent HD on his first full
hospital day. His BP remained stable in the normotensive range
on his home BP regimen for the remainder of his hospitalization.

## left sided chest pain: Thought most likely musculoskeletal
pain in the setting of increased coughing. No PE or aortic
dissection was seen on CTA. The pt's pain was easily controlled
with NSAIDS. His cardiac enzymes were elevated at baseline [**12-30**]
ESRD and he was monitored for one day on tele with no
significant events.

## cough/leukocytosis: The pt was afebrile throughout his stay.
Given lack of infiltrate on CT, this was suggestive of atypical
or viral infection. The pt was treated for atypical infection
with with a course of azithromycin.

## ESRD: Thought secondary to chronic hypertension. The pt
underwent HD on the first full hospital day.

## hyperlipidemia: Home statin continued.

## anemia: HCT currently at baseline. Recent Fe studies
consistent with anemia of CKD.
