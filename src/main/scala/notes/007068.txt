Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and mechanical ventilation with subsequent extubation

Bronchoscopy
Replacement of 14F nephrostomy cath via loop ileostomy


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 year old man with ESRD who has not been feeling
well over the last couple of weeks. He had been prescribed
azithromycin as an oupatient. Reportedly, a recent dialysis
session took off more fluid than normal. Patient became
pre-syncopal. He later went to the [**Hospital6 18346**]. A
CXR showed bilateral infiltrates. He started taking ceftriaxone
for presumed pneumonia. He did not significantly improved.

Yesterday he went into AFib after HD.  He remembers feeling
weak, pale, and being short of breath. He received IV metoprolol
and his rhythm converted to sinus. EKG showed ST depression in
lateral leads. He received a chest CTA which showed prominent
mucous plugging, complete blockage of R mainstem, collapse of
RLL. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. He
arrived on a mediccal floor on a NRB. He was then sent to the
ED.
.
In the ED he was tachypneic, working to breathe, and denied any
chest pain. He was not short of breath and not moving any air on
the right. Trop was reportedly up to 1. He had a pH of 7.21 on
VBG. He was placed on Bipap prior to transfer to the floor. Also
of note he has [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations in V2 and V3. This was seen by
cardiology and felt possibly related to demand and there would
be no acute intervention. He was given vancomycin and cefepime.

.
On arrival to the MICU, he was able to speak in full sentences
and denied any pain.

Cytology:
Bronchial lavage:
 	
 	NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
 	
 	Abundant neutrophils, scattered macrophages, and bronchial
 	cells.

Imaging:
Head CT:
FINDINGS:  Presence of previous intravenous contrast slightly
limits the evaluation for small intracranial hemorrhage but
there is no large acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or
territorial infarction.  The sulci are mildly prominent,
consistent with age-related atrophy.  _The visualized paranasal
sinuses, mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are clear.
No acute skeletal abnormalities.
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.

TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to inferior and posterior wall
hypokinesis. The right ventricular free wall thickness is
normal. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed
free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at
the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.4
cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2141-7-6**], mild aortic stenosis, moderate left ventricular
contractile dysfunction, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and
significant right ventricular dilatation and hypokinesis are now
present.

================================================================
MICU course:
Respiratory failure: Patient was empirically covered with
vancomycin and zosyn.  A BAL was done and a large mucus plug was
suctioned.  His fever curve trended down.  CXR was consistent
with pulmonary edema rather than pneumonia, so he was run 3 L
negative on dialysis with improvement in his vent settings.  He
was subequently successfully extubated. Antibiotics were
discontinued.

Systolic Dysfunction: Patient's troponins were elevated on
admission with TTE showing new inferoposterior hypokinesis,
consistent with acute coronary syndrome at some point in the
last several weeks. EF was 35%.  He was on aspirin, atorvastatin
80, and metoprolol.  ACE-I was initially held given low blood
pressures.

Atrial Fibrillation: Patient had very brief runs of atrial
fibrillation during dialysis the morning
