Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IR placement of percutaneous cholecystostomy tube

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 36509**] is a 77 year old woman with bipolar disorder,
dementia, prior CVA, who presented to the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED
complaining of several days of abdominal pain with fevers.  The
patient was unable to give the details of her recent symptoms
upon admission, presumably due to her dementia, and history was
obtained from her son.  Two weeks PTA, she started complaining
of abdominal distension.  Three days PTA, she started getting up
throughout the night Q30 mins to go to the bathroom and was
found defecating and urinating on floor.  Her son noticed her
urine was [**Location (un) 2452**]-colored.

At [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**], she was febrile to 100.8. An abdominal ultrasound
showed evidence of acute cholecystitis. An abdominal CT was
performed which showed an enhancing adrenal mass, a hepatic mass
(likely a cyst), and a hypodense splenic lesion.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] out of concern for malignancy and further
management of the cholecystitis.  She was also given ceftriaxone
and metronidazole.

Of note, she had a potassium of 2.3 on presentation to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] (she has a long-standing history of hypokalemia).
Urinalysis was consistent with UTI.  Blood and urine cultures
were drawn.  At [**Hospital1 18**] on transfer, she was afebrile with HR 98,
BP 146/80, RR 18, Sat 98% on 2L NC.

Past Medical History:
-Bipolar disorder h/o suicide attempt in [**4-25**] with [**Last Name (un) 68785**]
hospitaliziation
-prior CVA in [**2094**] (slurred speech, facial droop, L arm
weakness, unsteady gait --> good recovery with some residual L
arm weakness)
-hypothyroidism

-CAD
-HTN
-hypercholesterolemia
-hypokalemia (documented since [**2094**], with baseline K+ 3.0-3.8)
-CRI
-Atrial fibrillation

Social History:
Lives with her son and daughter who describe her as "an invalid
at baseline". She has 5 children, but is estranged from 3 of
them. Her husband died 8 years ago. She has a history of suicide
attempt in [**2102-4-18**] with hospitalization at [**Last Name (un) 68785**]. Currently
there is no tobacco or alcohol use.

IMAGING

CT Abdomen/Pelvis (from [**Location (un) 620**], [**2103-2-16**]):
The left atrium is enlarged. Mild bibasilar dependent
atelectasis is noted. Within the right middle lobe, air space
consolidation with associated air bronchograms are noted. Within
segment [**1-21**] and 4, there is a 1.4 x 4.1 cm low attenuation
slightly ill-defined focus visualized (image 17, series 2) with
a peripheral calcification . In addition, along the periphery of
segment 4, there is a 1.4 x 3.3 cm slightly ill-defined
partially peripherally enhancing low attenuation focus and along
the periphery of segment [**1-21**], and 4, there is a
well-circumscribed 3.0 x 2.5 cm low attenuation focus that
likely represents a cyst. The gallbladder is distended
associated with adjacent stranding. Within the gallbladder,
there are dependent ill-defined high density foci. Within the
spleen, there is a 5.5 mm indeterminate low attenuation focus
seen. Arising from the left adrenal gland, a 2.7 x 2.1 cm
enhancing mass is noted. Bilateral peripelvic cysts are seen.
Multiple nonpathologically enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes
are seen. There is a Foley within the bladder. Air is noted
within the bladder likely secondary to instrumentation. Please
note there is an associated peripheral calcification along the
low attenuation focus I described in the liver that measures 4.1
x 1.4 cm. A fat containing umbilical hernia is present. The
uterus is absent. The bones are diffusely demineralized.
Degenerative changes are noted.

RUQ ultrasound (from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] [**2103-2-16**]):
The gallbladder is distended and filled with mobile stones and
sludge. A son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign was elicited during the
examination. There is questionable focal thickening of the
gallbladder in the region of the fundal neck junction. No
significant gallbladder wall thickening nor pericholecystic
fluid is seen. The common bile duct is within normal limits
measuring 4.5 mm.

[**2103-2-17**] CXR:
A single portable image of the chest was obtained.  The cardiac
silhouette is at the upper limits of normal.  There are low lung
volumes.
There is perihilar fullness, may be exaggerated secondary to
underlying mild pulmonary venous congestion.  No focal airspace
opacity is seen.  There is minimal left basilar streaky
opacities likely secondary to underlying atelectasis.  The bony
thorax is grossly intact.

[**2103-2-22**] CXR:
New patchy opacities in the left lower lobe and inferior
lingula.
Although a component of volume loss is present suggesting
atelectasis,
coexistent pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate
clinical setting.

[**2103-2-19**] ECHO:
The left and right atrium are moderately dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic leaflets are mildly thickened. No
aortic stenosis is seen. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function.
Mild aortic regurgitation.

[**2103-2-22**] MRI:  *** Limited study
The examination is limited due to inability to cooperate with
breath-hold
imaging and absence of contrast administration
