Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9554**]
Chief Complaint:
ventricular fibrillation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  Cardiac catheterization
2.  AICD placement.

History of Present Illness:
   53yo M with no known heart disease, history of narcotic and
alcohol abuse on methodone presented to [**Hospital3 4107**] with
syncope. He had had recurrent syncopal events over the last 4
days prior to admission but refused medical attention. He was
found to be in ventricular fibrillation. He was defibrillated
and intubated. He awoke with conversion to sinus rhythm. was
agitated. (initial K 2.7, Initial ABG at [**Hospital3 4107**]
7.40/47/326.)He pulled out his ET tube, became progressively
obtunded with more ventricular ectory and was reintubatd. He was
treated for recurrent bouts of ventricular tachycardia with IV
amiodarone, magnesium and potassium, as well as ativan and
Pavulon. Drug screen was positive for benzodiazepine,
tetrahydrocannabinol and was negative for ETOH.  He developed VF
again on amiodarone and with K 3.0 requiring another
defibrillation. He had subsequent addition of lidocaine with
stabilization of ventricular ectopy. Weaning was attempted next
am when he began to develop ventricular ectopy. Echo showed
anterior septal hypokinesis with EF 30-40%.  His peak CK was
5675 post defibrillation

"Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. Other forms
of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including
significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on the
basis of this study. No focal liver lesions are identified. The
additional finding of splenomegaly is suggestive of intrinsic
liver disease."

[**2165-4-19**] TTE:
"1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall
motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal
(LVEF>55%).
3. The aortic root is mildly dilated."

"1) Status post right femoral head resection with acetabular
screws as described. No significant change.
2) Degenerative disease of the left hip, no obvious fracture but
due to osteopenia, subtle fractures may be missed and if
clinical suspicion persists, an MRI could be helpful."

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 53yo M with significant alcohol use, narcotic abuse and no
significant cardiac history presents with recurrent ventricular
arrhythmia s/p VF arrest in the setting of positive tox screen,
hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. He is transferred for EP
evaluation s/p VF cardiac arrest and EF 30-40%.
.
1.  CV:
A).  Coronaries: Pt was without prior history of CAD, however he
had a high CK on admission which was most likely due to his
repeated cardioversions.  However with VF and new CHF, ischemic
causes were ruled out with cardiac catheterization.  The cath
demonstrated clean coronaries confirming our suspicion regarding
the origin of the high CK.  The patient was continued on ACEI
(Lisinopril 5mg once daily), and BB (Atenolol 50mg once daily)
and was started on ASA.
.
B).  Pump: On admission, the patient was clinically found to
have significant CHF.  TTE at [**Hospital3 4107**] showed EF 30-40%.
Cardiac cath demonstrated clean coronaries, making ischemic
causes unlikely.  This is possibly due to alcohol induced,
infectious (HIV pending, HCV positive), narcotic induced,
familial, infiltrative or idiopathic or his arrhythmia.  This is
unlikely to be due to thyroid (TSH of 11 but normal free T4), or
hemochromoatosis (normal iron studies).  Sarcoidosis also can
not be excluded but is unlikely given the rest of his clinical
history, exam and normal Ca.  [**Doctor First Name **] and ESR also were wnl. Pt was
continued on ACEI and BB during his hospital stay as above.
After correction of his electrolytes, and repeated DCCV, he was
back in NSR and his CHF appeared to resolve as well.
.
C).  Rhythm: Pt presented with VFib arrest in setting of
positive THC, BZD with hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.  This is
most likely secondary to electrolyte imbalance from substance
abuse.  His electrolytes were repleted and the pt was started on
amiodarone 400mg TID.  He also received an AICD after his
cardiac catheterization without any complications.  He wa
monitored on telemetry during his hospital stay and remained in
NSR to Sinus Tach.  At time of discharge, the amiodarone was
discontinued as he now had an AICD implanted.  In addition,
given his hx of thyroid disorder and unknown pulmonary function
(but requiring fluticasone and albuterol), amiodarone was deemed
unsafe/unnecessary in this setting.  At time of discharge he was
sent home on clindamycin QID for 6days for prophylaxis (the
patient has an allergy to PCN).
.
.
2.  Pulm: Pt was intubated at OSH after his episodes of vfib
arrest. He was acutely agitated after conversion to NSR and self
extubated himself.  He progressively became obtunded with more
ventricular ectopy requiring re-intubation at OSH.  At [**Hospital1 18**], he
was extubated without complication.  After extubation, he was
found to have significant wheezing on exam but improved with IH
and nebulizers.  The patient was continued on Fluticasone [**Hospital1 **]
with albuterol nebulizers.  In addition, he was given
guaifenesin PRN for mucous secretions.  At time of discharge, he
was given additional prescriptions for the Fluticasone and
albuterol IH and given explicit instructions to both him and his
wife on how to use the IH and spacers effectively.  The patient
was also instructed to follow up with his PCP regarding [**Name9 (PRE) 1570**] and
sleep study.
