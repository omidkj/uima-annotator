OSH MRI:  There are mets involving the C7, T1, T2, T5, and T7
vertebrae.  Tumor extends into the canal at the T1, T5, and T7
levels.  There may be minimal extension into the anterior aspect
of the cancal on the left at the T2 level.
Tumor surrounds the cord and causes mild to moderate cord
compression at the T7 level.  There is only a very small
impression on the anterior aspect of the cord by tumor at the T5
level.

Following pre-operative staging and medical optimization,
patient presented for decompression and stabilization.  He
underwent the procedure, tolerating it well.  Given duration of
anesthesia and blood loss, he was transferred intubated to the
TICU in stable condition.  He was extubated uneventfully.
Patient was transferred to the floor once critical care issues
were resolved.

Pain was controlled with IV followed by PO medications.  Foley
was discontinued.  PT was consulted for assistance with the
patient's care.  He progressed with therapy and was fully
ambulatory at the time of discharge.  Oncology was contact[**Name (NI) **] to
arrange follow-up.  At the time of discharge, final path was
pending.

Once pain was well controlled, PO diet was tolerated, and once
pt had passed PT, he was deemed stable for D/C to home.
