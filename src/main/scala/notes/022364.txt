History of Present Illness:
59 yo M with history of nephrolithiasis and retained left
ureteral stent, s/p stent removal and left percutaneous
nephrostomy tube placement 1 month ago, presents with fever,
chills, left flank pain, and altered mental status.
.
The patient was found lying on the floor by his partner. The
patient was noted to be sleepy, not answering questions
approriately. The patient reports that he had nausea/vomiting 1
days PTA and awoke with left flank pain on the morning of
admission, then became confused in the afternoon. He reported
that his nephrostomy tube, which had given him frequent problems
since it was placed, was not functioning well, draining
blood/puss.

his mental status gradually improved fluids. He was given 3 L
NS, vancomycin 1 gm IV, Zosyn 4.5 gm IV, and Tylenol 1 gm PO.
Head CT and neck CT negative. Lactate was 3.4 but rose to 5.2
despite IV fluids. Vitals on transfer were T 40.6C HR 117 RR 27

Imaging:
CT abdomen pelvis with contrast [**2176-5-7**]: 4x7cm rim left
subcapsular renal fluid collection which may represent a
hematoma. Superinfection cannot be excluded. Left 7mm distal
ureteral obstructing stone with severe hydro-ureter and
hydronephrosis despite a left nephrostomy tube in place.
Hyperemic ureter consistent with ureteritis.  Surrounding
perinephric fat stranding.
.
CT head w/o contrast [**2176-5-7**]:
no hemorrhage, herniation, hydrocephalus; no CT evid for acute
cortical stroke; mucus retention cyst v polyp in L max antrum
.
CT C-spine without contrast [**2176-5-7**]:
No cervical spine fractures. Multi-level degenerative disease.
.
CXR (portable AP) [**2176-5-7**]:
No definite acute pulmonary process.
.
Renal US [**2176-5-12**]:
IMPRESSION: Persistent lower pole left perinephric hematoma.
Superinfection of the hematoma cannot be excluded by imaging
appearance.
.
Echo [**2176-5-14**]:
The left atrium is dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
.
Renal US [**2176-5-15**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Decrease in size of left perinephric hematoma.
2. Bilateral non-obstructing urinary calculi.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo M with complicated urologic history including
nephrolithiasis, longstanding left ureteral stent (recently
removed), and recent percutaneous nephrostomy [**2176-4-4**], admitted
to the MICU with urosepsis. CT abdomen/pelvis showed left
hydroureter, distal obstructing stone, and perinephric fluid
collection (c/w infected hematoma).  Improved but had continued
fevers.  S/p lithotrypsy in house with plans for outpatient
nephrogram and possible nephrostomy tube removal and abx until
hematoma evaluated.
.
# Urosepsis: On admission, the patient had tachycardia and
elevated lactate. CT showed left ureteral obstructing stone with
severe hydroureter and hydronephrosis
despite nephrostomy tube in place, as well as a left 4x7cm
subcapsular fluid collection, with superinfection unable to be
ruled out. The patient was started on vancomycin and Zosyn and
aggressively hydrated with normal saline. Tobramycin was later
added. He underwent drainage of the left subcapsular fluid
collection but interventional radiology, with drainge of bloody
fluid that eventually grew pans [**Last Name (un) 36**] Klebsiella. As anesthesia
and interventional radiology were preparing for the procedure,
the patient became hypotensive and was started on phenylephrine.
After the procedure, he was transferred back to the MICU, where
multple attempts a central venous catheter placement were made,
including right internal jugular and left subclav
