Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Exertional chest discomfort, abnormal ETT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2111-8-20**] Three vessel coronary artery bypass grafting - LIMA to
LAD, vein graft to diagonal, vein graft to PDA


History of Present Illness:
This is a pleasant Cantonese-speaking gentleman whounderwent an
ETT on [**2111-7-10**] here at [**Hospital1 18**]. The patient exercised for 5.5
minutes of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4001**] protocol to an APHR of 94%. Patient
experienced anginal symptoms with uninterpretable EKG changes at
the achieved workload. Images showed severe inferior and
inferolateral wall perfusion defect with a small amount of
reversibility. Mild, reversible distal anterior wall and apical
perfusion defect. Transient increased dilatation of LV cavity
with stress. Global hypokinesis with calculated EF of 19%.

The patient reports that this past winter, he developed a chest
discomfort that radiated to both shoulders when walking outside.
To relieve the discomfort he would go indoors and take one
sublingual NitroQuick with good results. Since this time, he has
continued to experience chest and bilateral shoulder discomfort
with walking or when he becomes nervous. The patient also
reports
occasionally experiencing SOB and mild diaphoresis with these
episodes. He denies any associated nausea or vomiting. The
patient is now referred for a cardiac cath to further evaluate.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent cardiac cath which revealed
severe three vessel disease and depressed LV function.
Angiography showed a 50% left main lesion; the LAD had proximal
and mid 80% lesions; the first diagonal had a 90% stenosis; the
circumflex was diffusely diseased; the obtuse marginal had a 90%
lesion; and the dominant RCA had a proximal 90% stenosis. Left
ventriculography showed no mitral regurgitation and a LVEF of
25%. Based on the above results, cardiac surgery was consulted
and further evaluation was performed.

A carotid ultrasound found a significant left-sided plaque with
a 70-79% carotid stenosis. On the right, there was less than 40%
carotid stenosis. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed that the
overall left ventricular systolic function was
moderately depressed. There posterolateral and posterior walls
were thinned and
akinetic. The LVEF was estimated at 40%. There was only mild MR.
 Workup was otherwise unremarkable and he was cleared for
surgery.

On [**8-20**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed three vessel coronary
artery bypass grafting with repair of LV aneurysm. After the
operation, he was brought to the CSRU. On POD#1, he was noted to
have left sided paralysis for which a head CT scan was obtained.
Neurology was concomitantly consulted. The CT scan showed
findings consistent with a right middle cerebral artery
territory infarction which was likely in an early subacute phase
and involved the right posterior frontal and anterior parietal
lobes. Given the history, anticoagulation was not recommended by
neurology as this stroke did not appear to be embolic. He was
kept somewhat hypertensive and transfused with PRBCs to maintain
hematocrit over 30%.

He was weaned from his drips and extuated by POD#2, and
transferred to the floor by POD #5. Swallow evaluation showed
aspiration of thin liquids. Diarrhea was cdiff negative.
He was transferred to the telemetry floor, and has remained
hemodynamically stable.  His lasix and potassium were
discontinued since he appears to now be euvolemic.  He is ready
to begin rehabilitation.
