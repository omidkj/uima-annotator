methylprednisolone.  ABG with PCO2 of 82, baseline of 60s. VS:
114/64 69 32 98% CPAP. Repeat ABG unchanged on BiPAP showing
hypercarbia and acidosis. Patient continued to appear somnolent
despite interventions including biPAP and subsequently intubated
with etomidate 20 mg IV and succinycholine 120 mg IV. He was
sedated with fentanyl/versed gtts but stopped in setting of
hypotension (lowest [**Location (un) 1131**] 52/34 HR 64) and given 2 L NS.

II. Radiology

A. CXR
XAM: Chest, single frontal view.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: 55-year-old male with history of shortness
of breath.

COMPARISON: Multiple priors including [**2161-12-8**], [**2161-12-6**] and
[**2161-12-4**].

FINDINGS: Subtle right lower lobe patchy opacity appears
slightly more
prominent compared to the study of [**2161-12-8**] but less prominent
compared to
[**2161-12-6**]. Findings could be due to aspiration or infectious
process. Left
infrahilar opacity is again seen. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is
seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable and
unremarkable.

III. Cardiology

A. EKG
Sinus tachycardia. Slight ST-T wave changes are non-specific and
may be within normal limits. Since the previous tracing of
[**2161-11-29**] sinus tachycardia is now present and the marked ST-T
wave abnormalities have decreased

Pending studies
Blood culture x 2, urine culture


Brief Hospital Course:
65-year-old male with mental retardation, history of severe COPD
with multiple admissions for same complaint requiring intubation
presenting with hypercarbic respiratory failure likely secondary
to COPD exacerbation. Goals of care were discussed, and patient
subsequently underwent tracheostomy.

# Hypercarbic Respiratory failure
Etiology thought to be COPD exacerbation given symptoms of cough
in week prior, continued smoking, and absence of leukocytosis,
fever, and definitive infiltrate. He was treated with a 5-day
course of levofloxacin and placed on a prednisone taper.
Multiple pressure support trial were attempted resulting in
worsening hypercarbia and continued intubation. [**Name (NI) **] sister
and patient were involved in discussion regarding goals of care
and decided on undergoing a tracheostomy given multiple
intubations in the recent past for his severe COPD. It was felt
that patient has capacity to make this decision given he
demonstrated understanding risks and benefits of the procedure.
He spiked a fever to 101 on [**1-14**], but felt to be related to
post-procedure. Blood and urine cultures no growth to date and
CXR with no infiltrate. He remained afebrile for 24 hours
afterwards.

# Hypotension
Patient initially hypotensive on admission especially with
sedation after intubation but appeared euvolemic. Attributed to
intubation with sedatives and PEEP. He was treated with a 4 L NS
bolus and continued to produce adequate urine output.
Normotensive throughout rest of MICU course and at time of
dsicharge.


# Pyuria
Patient noted to have pyuria on admission and history of VRE.
Urine culture was negative.

# Glucose intolerance. The patient had elevated blood sugars
during last hospitalization, which may be secondary to steroid
usage vs. hyperglycemia of acute illness vs. a pre-diabetic
state. Patient remained of SSI in house. This should be
monitored closely as an outpt.

# Anemia
Patient noted to have anemia on admission (Hct 39.8). Advise
age-appropriate cancer screening on outpatient basis and
outpatient follow-up.

# Schizophrenia
Patient remained of zyprexa.
