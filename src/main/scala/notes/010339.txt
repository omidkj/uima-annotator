Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8115**]
Chief Complaint:
Right flank pain & hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
patient is a 64-year-old man with history of morbid obesity s/p
gastric bypass, chronic pulm fibrosis and recently diagnosed
renal cell cancer and alcoholic liver cirrhosis who presented to
the emergency room with two weeks of right flank pain.  Pt
states 2 wks ptp had acute onset of R sided flank pain, [**11-4**],
shapr in nature which occupied most of the right side of his
back and spread to his right shoulder.  He called 911 and by the
time the EMS arrived his pain had dissipated.  He was evaluated
at [**Hospital3 8834**] where CT, EKG, and CXR were
performed (see below for details). The patient reportedly left
AMA.  1 week priro to presentation, pt reports similar pain
which lasted 10 minutes in duration, then resolved.  He did not
seek medical attention at that time.  The morning of
presentation, pt. had again similar right sided
back/shoulder/flank pain [**11-4**] acute in onset.  He was supposed
to leave on vactaion to [**State 108**] today, but due to the pain
decided to come to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for evaulation.   By the time he
arrived, his pain had resolved.  He explains the pain is
non-reproducible with no aggravating or alleviating factors.  He
has not tried any analgesics for the pain.

In the emergency room, his initial vital signs were T 97.6, HR
79, BP 101/55, RR 18, sat 99% on room air. Labs were notable for
white count of 7.6 with ~80% polys. Hematocrit was 29.4 (near
recent baseline), and platelets were 321. Chemistry showed
creatinine of 1.4 (up from baseline 1.0) with BUN of 21. INR was
1.5 with normal Tbili, ALT of 24 and AST of 75, and alk phos of
227 (all consistent with recent baseline). UA was checked which
was negative. Lactate was 2.0. CXR showed no infiltrate. EKG was
without ischemic changes. Per report, patient underwent bedside
echocardiogram that was unremarkable. Two peripheral IVs were
placed (18g and 20g). Blood cultures were drawn, patient was
given 2.5 liters of IVF. Per report, his systolic blood pressure
came up from 80s to 90s. He was asymptomatic, and pain had
resolved at time of admission. Vitals at time of admission are T
96.7, HR 90, BP 90/47, RR 25, satting 93% RA.

Of note the patient has been seen in the H/O clinic by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Doctor Last Name **], where he has been noted to have decreased
PO intake and low blood pressures.  In regards to his RCC
diagnosed in [**11/2130**], he is curreenlty a high risk candidate for
resection given his pulmonary disease.  He was recently admitted
in [**9-/2131**] for similar symptoms of hypotension deemed to be from
poor PO intake which was fluid responsive.

The patient arrived to the ICU stable in NAD.

ROS: Currently, patient endorses flank pain x2 weeks, started
out [**11-4**], in the middle of back, radiating up to right
shoulder. Currently patient is without pain. Denies nausea,
vomiting, fever, chills, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria,
hematuria.

Studies:
CXR [**2132-1-13**]:
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with chronic interstitial lung
disease,
unchanged. No new areas of focal consolidation or pneumothorax.
.
CT abd/pelvis [**2132-1-14**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma or other explanation
for
hematocrit drop.
2. Overall stable size and appearance of heterogeneous right
renal mass which continues to be highly suspicious for renal
cell carcinoma.
