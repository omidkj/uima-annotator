CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT

Reason: ?ET tube correctly positioned

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
45 year old man with aortic dissection
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
?ET tube correctly positioned
EXAMINATION: AP chest.

INDICATION: Aortic dissection.

Single AP view of the chest was obtained on [**2119-2-25**] at 05:06
hours. No prior films are available for comparison. The patient
is intubated with the tip of the ET tube approximately 5.5 cm
above the carina. A Swan-Ganz catheter has been inserted from
the right side and its tip lies in the main pulmonary artery.
There is almost complete opacification of the left hemithorax.
Bullous changes are seen at both apices. Diffuse haziness seen
in the right hemithorax likely represents layering pleural
effusion. Also, there is increased prominence of the
interstitial markings on the right side.

IMPRESSION:

By history provided, the patient has aortic dissection. As
described, there is almost complete opacification of the left
hemithorax which presumably is a combination of fluid/blood and
atelectasis. Likely layering effusion on the right side.
Interstitial prominence consistent with overload or edema.
Bullous changes at both apices. Please correlate the findings
with any prior imaging, which is not available to us at the time
of this dictation.

Results  Measurements  Normal Range

Aorta - Sinus Level:  *4.8 cm  <= 3.6 cm
Aorta - Ascending:  *4.1 cm  <= 3.4 cm

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast in the body of the LA. Thrombus in the body of the LA.
No thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD
by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Severely dilated LV
cavity. Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus. Moderately dilated
ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in ascending aorta. Mildly
dilated descending aorta. Ascending aortic intimal
flap/dissection.. Descending aorta intimal flap/aortic
dissection.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets. No AS. Moderate (2+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mild (1+) MR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. Emergency study. Results were personally reviewed
with the MD caring for the patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. A thrombus is
seen in the body of the left atrium. No thrombus is seen in the
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior and
posterior akinesis
3. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are simple atheroma
in the ascending aorta. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. A mobile density is seen in the ascending aorta
consistent with an intimal flap/aortic dissection. The
dissection originates at the level of the LMCA and flow is not
seen in the Left Main. Flow is seen in the RCA. A mobile density
is seen in the descending aorta consistent with an intimal
flap/aortic dissection.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results .
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Taken directly to OR on arrival for possible emergency surgery.
Hypotensive, in shock,on multiple inotropes close to cardiac
arrest. TEE done in OR showed EF 10%, no flow in left main
consistent with LM occlusion, global severe hypokinesia, and
clots in the left atrium. Both lower extremities rigid, severly
acidotic pH in the region of 6 and base excess above -20,
prolonged hypotension during transfer lasting more than a few
hours, unresponsive for about 4 hours. Decision made by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] not to proceed with surgery given the findings on echo
and clinical exam, as well as severe acidosis. Multiple
unsuccessful attempts were made to contact the family. He was
transferred to the CVICU and expired at 6:44 AM on [**2-25**]. Unable
to contact family, and message was left informing them.
Susequently family contact[**Name (NI) **] and informed.
