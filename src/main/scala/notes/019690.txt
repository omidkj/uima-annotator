Brief Hospital Course:
As per attending note on [**12-26**] in SICU
Briefly, [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a h/o
prior R-occipital infarct presents with new onset speech
difficulties and right sided weakness. Initially taken to
[**Location (un) 620**]
ED, where she was not felt to be a iv tPA candidate and
transferred to [**Hospital1 **]. Details of transfer and results of imaging
studies mentioned in note above. Intraarterial tpA treatment was
entertained but her imaging profile suggested a higher risk of
bleeding and small area of salvageable penumbral tissue adn she
was not given thrombolytics. Overnight, has continued to be
somnolent, not following commands. Spiked a fever and started on
iv antibiotics (vanco, levoflox). ROS: as above; otherwise
unobtainable. On exam, droswy, opens eyes briefly but drifts off
to sleep. Conjugate gaze deviation to left. Right facial
weakness
with R-sided HP (A>L). Moves left arm and leg purposefully.
A/P: L-MCA territory infarction, likely embolic. Carotid
studies
show a moderate b/l carotid stenosis, will obtain dopplers for
corraboration. Continue on asa for now, permissive HTN. On iv
antibiotics for pneumonia.
Condition discussed with family memebrs at bedside, questions
answered. Family has decided to make her DNR/DNI. Transfer to
step-down.
