History of Present Illness:
This is a 83 year-old female with a h/o ischemic colitis, MGUS,
HTN, AS who presents with SOB, lightheaded, found to have Hct of
19 down from 26. She developed a transfusion reaction vs flash
pulmonary edema in the ED and was admitted to MICU for further
monitoring. She was briefly on Bipap and her dyspnea/hypoxia
resolved. She was diursed 1.2 L (but her breathing improved
prior to this). Her hct has been stable after 2U pRBCs. Please
see below for more details of her presentation and course. Ms.
[**Known lastname **] feels well currently, no dyspnea, orthopnea, PND, fevers,
chills, cough, LE swelling.
.
Pt recently had an episode of nonbloody vomiting, felt also more
tired, lightheaded and had DOE. Denied any CP, syncope,
diaphoresis. She is being closely followed by her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] found
to have worsened anemia with Hct from baseline of 30s down to 24
on [**2126-5-6**]. Her valsartan was held and her PPI was increased to
[**Hospital1 **]. She underwent EGD on [**2126-5-8**]. EGD was unremarkable but pt
had a granulomatous mass on colonoscopy in [**9-/2125**] which was
initially suspicious for plasma cell neoplasm and led eventually
to the diagnosis of MGUS (per last Heme/Onc note from [**2126-3-27**]).
Of note, she has known ischemic colitis with LGIB in [**2121**] and
[**7-/2125**], treated conservatively.
.
On day of admission, she was more lightheaded, became
diaphoretic while trying to have a BM in the bathroom. Her
relatives called 911 and she was brought to the ED.
.
In the ED, her VS were T97.1, 84, 116/50, 12, 99%RA. She was
guaiac positive but takes iron. An EKG was unremarkable. CXR
with no acute process. Labs notable for Hct of 19 down from 26
just three days ago. Pt was given 2L IVF and was ordered for 2U
PRBC. However, after 60cc of blood, she developed facial
redness, diaphoresis, was cool and pale, and was sob with
diffuse crackles on exam. She says that she was not at all
dyspneic until getting blood. Her BP went down to 83/41
transiently. RR up to high 30s and tachy to 122. She was given
IV benadryl, solumderol, and zantac. Repeat CXR showed fluid
overload. She was started on BiPAP with improvement of symptoms.
She was weaned to NC (satting 100% on 3L) but her admission bed
was changed to ICU for closer monitoring.
.
On arrival in the MICU, she was less SOB, satting well on 2.5L
NC. In the MICU she was briefly on BIPAP, SOB resolved with
before diuresis. She recieved 2U pRBCs without event, but was
diuresed 1.2L with 10mg IV lasix. Transfusion medicine feels
that she did not have a blood reaction, but likely flash
pulmonary edema.
.
ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, nightsweats,
abdominal pain, chest pain, or lower extremity edema. She c/o
occasional urinary frequency, dysuria, and constipation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Anemia: Black, guaiac positive stools suggestive of UGI source.
Baseline Hct in 30s, on admission with hct of 19 ([**5-16**]) s/p 2
units pRBC in the MICU. Hct stable throughout hospital course at
26-27.  On [**5-20**] colonoscopy with polyps in the descending colon
s/p biopsy.  She was discharged with capsule endoscopy on [**5-21**].
She was restarted on her regimen of iron.
.
Hypoxia: Was thought to be secondary to TRALI versus pulmonary
edema from acute blood-transfusion-related volume overload.  In
the end a diagnosis of TRALI was preferred given the right
timing of onset, hypotension and facial flushing.  Hypoxia
completely resolved since being on the floor.
.
AS: Moderate AS (AoVA 0.8-1.19cm2) on last echo in [**2122**].  Repeat
ECHO here was unchaged. At baseline she is asymptomatic with AS,
though this may have contributed to her SOB/hypoxia here as
noted above. She remained stable throughout the rest of her
hospitalization.
.
HTN: She was restarted on her BB and [**Last Name (un) **] at discharge and
tolerated these well.
