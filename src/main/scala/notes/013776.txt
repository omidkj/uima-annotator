Pre Bypass Graft

The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is dilated. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with a global mild hypokinesis
of LV and focalities in apical regions with mid anteroseptal and
anterior regions.. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 to 35 %).

The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free
wall contractility.

There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

Post grafting:
Normal RV systolic function.
Overall LVEF 35%. The wall motion abnormalities are similar to
pre grafting.
Intact thoracic aorta.
Mild MR.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
