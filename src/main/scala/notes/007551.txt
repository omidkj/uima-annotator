History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13972**] is a 72M with CAD h/o CABG (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM,
SVG-Ramus, [**2102**], last cath [**3-29**] with 3VD patent LIMA to LAD,
patent SVG to OM, patent SVG to R1, but R1 terminates after
touchdown point, no intervention), paroxysmal afib (last episode
of PAF in [**7-29**] with trop leak), PVD, DM2 and ESRD on HD & PD
s/p HD day of admission (removal of 4L) presents to ED with
fever to 102, hypotension, and AF with RVR.  He had recently
been seen by his PMD for LE cellulitis and was given an rx for
Augmentin x 1 day.  He denies any chest pain, LH, dizziness,
palpitations.  He reports a HA which is not unusual for him
after HD.  Per his wife he has had persistent diarrhea for the
past month, [**1-27**] loose stool/day.  He also suffers from
post-prandial nausea which has been present for months.  He has
a chronic cough and reports worsening DOE for past 3-4 months.
Known to have low SBP (SBP 85/40 in clinic).
.
In the ED the patient had temperature to 102, ventricular rate
in 100s, BP 79/47.  He was given gentle IVF, flagyl, vancomycin,
and ceftriaxone.  He was started on amiodarone load 150mg,
followed by amiodarone 1mg/min gtt.  CXR showed ? aspiration
PNA, unable to send PD fluid for culture as pt was empty.

Social History:
Patient has been married for 42 years with a supportive wife who
"visits me every single day I'm in the hospital and drives me to
dialysis." He expresses some anxiety regarding feeling like "a
burden" on his family.  He has two children, one 29 yo son who
is a financial analyst in [**Location (un) 21601**], and one older daughter who
is raising five children in [**Location (un) 30790**], [**State 2748**].  He is very

his own pharmacies but sold them to [**Doctor First Name **] and has worked for
the past 18 years at the VA. He says the VA is "holding my job

Past cardiology studies:

[**2108-2-27**] Persantine MIBI: IMPRESSION: 1. Mild-moderate

Cath [**2106-12-22**]:
R dominant system
LMCA: 60% occluded
LAD: widely patent LIMA to LAD. SVG to RI 80% ostial
LCX: patent SVG to OM. LCX 80% prox.
RCA: proximally occluded, filled by collaterals from LIMA/SVG
.
Cath [**2108-3-28**]
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant
circulation
demonstrated severe native vessel coronary artery disease. The
LMCA was diffusely diseased with 60% distal stenosis. The LAD
was totally
occluded in the proximal segement. The distal LAD had mild
disease and was supplied by the LIMA graft. The LCx had severe
diffuse disease. The OM and Ramus were totally occluded at their
origins, but filled via an SVG.
2. Saphenous vein angiography demonstrated widely patent SVG to
OM and SVG to Ramus. The Ramus was totally occluded after the
touchdown point and filled via collaterals from the grafted OM.
3. Arterial conduit arteriography demonstrated a widely patent
LIMA to LAD.
4. Opening pressure in the central aorta was moderately
elevated.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA to LAD.
3. Patent SVG to OM.
4. Patent SVG to Ramus, but total occlusion after touchdown
point.

CURRENT STUDIES:

[**2108-10-6**] CXR: IMPRESSION:
1.  Increased left lower lobe opacity, which may represent
pneumonia, although atelectasis is possible.
2.  Right middle lobe opacity, highly suspicious for pneumonia.
3.  Worsening fluid overload with increased pulmonary
vascularity and small effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 72 year old M with h/o ESRD s/p HD day of admission
(took off 4.2L), severe PVD s/p multiple interventions,
paroxysmal AFib, CAD s/p CABG, CHF EF 30%, DM2, bronchiectasis
admitted to CCU with a-fib/RVR, self-converted to NSR, fever,
hypotension, and LE cellulitis.

CARDIAC
# Rhythm: Mr. [**Known lastname 13972**] has a history of paroxysmal Afib.  He
presented to the ED following hemodialysis in atrial
fibrillation, but hemodynamically stable.  He was also noted to
have a troponin leak.  He was given an esmolol drip in the ED
with no response, followed by an amiodarone load 150mg then
1mg/min drip.  On the way up to the CCU he converted back to
sinus rhythm.  This was attributed more to chance than to the
amiodarone as the patient takes amiodarone at home.  The patient
remained in sinus rhythm for the first 24 hours of his
hospitalization, however on hospital day 2 he flipped into rapid
atrial fibri
