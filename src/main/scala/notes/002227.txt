Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation, placement of arterial line, central line

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 84698**] is a 59F with a PMH s/f chronic pain with narcotic
abuse (tramadol), remote history of ETOH abuse, and depression.
This history is taken from the patient's husband, and from the
medical record as the patient is not able to give a history
secondary to altered mental status.

Per the patient's husband, the patient has been having altered
mental status for several months now. He notes that things
progressed when she was laid off from her job as a social worker
(in a dual diagnosis center). He observed that her behavior was
more disorganized- she would put items away in the wrong place,
was sleeping more, taking longer to do things that she would
normally do quickly. Eventually she became more agitated, and
more disheveled. Mr. [**Known lastname 84698**] brought his wife to see a
neurologist this past [**Month (only) 216**] to have this worked up, where she
admitted to abusing tramadol for the first time. She reported
obtaining it illegally from the internet and taking [**8-/2056**] 50mg
pills at a time. An MRI at that time did not show any acute CVA
or other process.

On Monday ([**9-16**]) the patient's husband woke up to the sound of
his wife sounding agitated. He found her on the floor,
disheveled. He helped her back into bed, and returned to sleep.
The next day, after coming home from work, he found her in her
bed covered in feces. She was arousable to voice, and could
follow simple commands, but had slurred speech, and was
confused. An ambulance was called, and the patient was taken to
[**Hospital3 **].

At [**Hospital3 4107**] the patient was noted to have the following:

1. Thrombocytopenia: On admission, her platelet count was
11,000, and fell to 7,000 on the day of transfer. Her CBC was
otherwise normal with a WBC count of 10.7 and a HCT of 36.7.
Coagulation studies were wnl, fibrinogen 986, FDP negative.
Total bilirubin was 1.0 A smear was evaluated by the
hematologist at [**Hospital3 **], and per report, no schistocytes
were seen.
2. Leukocytosis: Elevated to 10.7 with 76% neutrophils and 15%
bands. Found to have a UTI on urinalysis, started on
levofloxacin.
3. Acute renal failure: Creatinine was initially elevated to
2.2. Urine sediment showed granular casts. This improved to 1.8
with fluid challenges. A CK was 138. FeNa was 0.15%, urine
eosinophils were negative.
4. AMS: The patient had a serum alcohol and tylenol level WNL,
as well as a negative urine toxicology. A head CT non-contrast
showed no acute abnormalities. She did admit to last using
tramadol 4 days ago, and also using her husbands ativan.
5. UTI: Urinaylysis with too many to count WBC, 4+ bacteria and
positive LES. She was started on levofloxacin 250mg IV daily

Review of systems is notable for a URI two months ago, easy
bruising, and one episode of epistaxis in the last month. Her
husband denies fevers, melena, hematochezia, hematuria. He does
note that she has had the chills.

ECHO: [**2115-9-19**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = [**9-12**] %). The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a small to moderate sized
circumferential pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Severely globally depressed left ventricular
systolic function. Small to moderate circumferential pericardial
effusion with no evidence of tamponade.

CT Head w/o Contrast: [**2115-9-19**]
There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or
vascular
territorial infarction. The ventricles and sulci are normal in
size and in
configuration. Extracranial soft tissue structures are
unremarkable. The
included osseous structures reveal no fracture. The visualized
mastoid air
cells are clear. The visualized paranasal sinuses reveal a small
amount of
mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses bilaterally.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CT Chest/ Abdoman/ pelvis: [**2115-9-19**]
Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.5 cm above the
carina. The lungs contain dense bilateral consolidations, worst
at the lower lobe on the left and involving all lobes on th
