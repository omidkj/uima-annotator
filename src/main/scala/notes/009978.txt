History of Present Illness:
71 y.o.M with history of HTN, aortic valve replacement,
presented to [**Hospital 487**] hospital on [**3-23**] with complains of new
onset of epigastric pain, radiating to the R side accompanied by
Nausea and vomiting. At that time he had epigastirc and RUQ
tenderness to palpation. His laboratory data showed increase in
transaminases as well as in amylase and lipase. He underwent
abdominal ultrasound which revelaed gallstones, normal CBD.
Patient was addmittted for conservative mgt. on HD4 patient
developed worsening of symptoms and some respiratory distress
(CO2 retention). His CT scan revelaed some inflamation around
the pancreas as well as pseudocyst. Patient status continued to
detirorate requiring prolong ICU course with extubation and and

Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro: Patient has received some sedation with Ativan and
propofol during perioperative periods. Once recovered from that,
he is alert, oriented to self and place. he can mouth words and
maintain simple conversation. He showed some signs of depression
and was started (and maintained) on Paxil
his pain through the admission was controlled with morphine,
fentanyl, Percocet
Patient develop tremors in his arms and head, for which
neurology consult was obtained and felt that it is an essential
tremor, which does not need any treatment at this time
Now: patient is alert, oriented to self and place, does not have
pain, does not require any sedation, still has tremor

Cardiovascular: through out patient admission he remained in
atrial fibrillation, with heart rate 80-100, controlled with
Lopressor, blood pressure stable, His repeated echocardiogram
showed stable EF of 55%, mild CHF and mild left ventricular
outflow obstruction. cardiology consult was obtained.
[**6-22**] - patient developed LUE DVT associated with catheter,
catheter was removed

Respiratory: patient had BiPAP requiring sleep apnea at the base
line. By the time of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] he had prolong intubation
course, with a few attempts for extubation which failed,
eventually requiring tracheostomy (performed at the OSH).
He had persistent pleural effusion  left more then right,
requiring tube thoracostomy, pleurocentesis, thoracic surgery
consult. As patient condition improved, although he still has
small bilateral pleural effusions, they are stable and do not
require other interventions. His lungs show evidence of
bilateral atelectasis, mild bibasilar collapse, evidence of
edema. He has multiple attempts to wean him of the vent, however
we are only able to wean him to CPAP with peep of 8 and PS of
14. he is receiving a few recruitment breaths every 6 hours. Had
a few bouts of ventilator associated and aspiration pneumonia
with proteus, klebsiella, Xanthomonas, yeast which are now
controlled (please see ID section), had a number of bronchoscopy
for evaluation and diagnosis.
Patient has been evaluated by speech and swallow service a few
times, however failed attempts to Passy-Mur valve placement
Now: patient is stable on CPAP, bilateral rhonchi and wheezing.
Tracheostomy tube has positional leak (not influencing his resp
condition). receiving recruitment breaths q6hours. growing GNR
from sputum culture, treated with meropenem

Gastrointestinal: after admission patient underwent exploratory
laparotomy with cyst gastrostomy, G, J and cholecystostomy tube
placement, please see operative note for details. Patient
tolerated procedure well, with prompt return of bowel function.
His tube feedings were started through jejunostomy tube. His
cholecystostomy tube was repositioned by OR.
On [**7-14**], Mr [**Known lastname **] was noted to have an rising WBC to 16.8,
continued low-grade fevers, rigors, and tachycardic into 140s in
atrial fibrillation with systolic BP dropping as low as 70.
Blood, peritoneal, central line, and sputum cultures were drawn.
Because the cholecystostomy tube had not drained throughout the
day, a T-tube study was performed to evaluate the position of
the cholecystostomy tube.  This study showed contrast
extravasation from the indwelling cholecystostomy tube near its
insertion. Mr [**Known lastname **] was taking into the OR for peritonitis,
question of leaking
cholecystostomy tube.  where a cholecystectomy, abdominal
washout, replacement of the G-tube, left tube thoracostomy, and
liver biopsy were all performed.  He was transferred to the
N-SICU postoperatively.
On [**7-15**], given his rising Tbili to 4.9, an ERCP was performed
and a biliary stent was successfully placed in the common bile
duct. follow up ERCP and EGD showed satisfactory position of the
biliary drain
[**2207-9-14**] patient again developed increase of the G-tube output
with feculent looking material, evidence of aspiration with
succus from the ET tube suctioned,respiratory distress, septic
physiology. patient had G-tube study which showed that G-tube
eroded into the transverse colon. Patient g-tube was pulled back
to the area of the cyst, which seem to control patient's output.
[**10-9**] - patient developed increased G tube output, he underwent
g-tube study which showed well formed tract between colon and
stomach(former area of pancreatic cyst, now almost completely
obliterated) and g-tube advance too far into the colon. the tube
was pulled back which mildly decrease its output. J tu
