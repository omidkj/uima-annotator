CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2166-6-16**] 4:49 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: ? improved atelectasis/consolidations

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
17M s/p c-spine cord injury with, on trach collar, desaturation
and fever , bronch'd [**6-14**] for LLL consolidation
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? improved atelectasis/consolidations
AP CHEST, 5:16 A.M. ON [**6-16**].

HISTORY: Spinal cord injury, fever and desaturation.

IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**2077-6-9**], and 19:

Diffuse interstitial pulmonary abnormality has resolved, but
left lower lobe consolidation has not and could be due to
persistent atelectasis or pneumonia. Heart is normal size. There
is no appreciable pleural abnormality. Tracheostomy tube in
standard placement.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2166-6-13**] 12:45 PM

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

Reason: Looking for a source of infection.
Field of view: 33 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
17 year old man with c-spine fx, s/p c spine surgery, now with
unexplained fevers while on Abx.Small leakage from PEG site.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Looking for a source of infection.
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATIONS: 17-year-old man with cervical spine fracture status
post cervical spine surgery, now with unexplained fever. Also
small amount of leakage around the PEG site.

COMPARISONS: [**2166-5-31**].

TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis
were obtained with oral and intravenous contrast.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a tracheostomy tube.
There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axial lymphadenopathy. The
heart, great vessels, and pericardium are unremarkable. There
are no pleural or pericardial effusions.
There is a small density at the right lung base peripherally,
probably atelectasis. In addition, there is a vaguely increased
ground glass opacity throughout the right lower lobe, sparing
the right middle and upper lobes. This appearance could
represent the very early appearance of the consolidation or
perhaps atypical pneumonia. The left upper lobe is clear. The
left lower lobe is mostly collapsed. Although the presence of
infection cannot be excluded, the left lower lobe opacity, with
volume loss, is most consistent with atelectasis.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a gastrostomy tube
in position. The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and
adrenal glands are unremarkable. A hypoattenuating focus in the
right kidney of 11 x 16 mm in axial dimensions is not fully
characterized but most likely represents a simple cyst. There is
an infrarenal inferior vena cava filter in appropriate position.
The stomach, small and large bowel are within normal limits.
There is no lymphadenopathy or free air or fluid.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is a Foley catheter in
the bladder, and a small catheter in the rectum. The rectum,
sigmoid, bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles are
unremarkable. There is no lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Near collapse of the left lower lobe.
2. Diffuse nodular ground-glass opacity throughout the right
lower lobe, suggestive of atypical infection and/or very early
consolidation.

Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] on the same day.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT  [**2166-6-10**] 4:29 PM

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT

Reason: FEVER AND BEDREST SPINAL CORD INJURY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
17 year old man with C-spine injury,
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
looking for DVT
HISTORY: 17-year-old male with cervical spine injury and concern
for lower extremity DVT.

BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and Doppler
son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the bilateral common femoral, superficial femoral,
deep femoral, and popliteal veins were performed. There is
normal compressibility, waveform, flow and augmentation. No
intraluminal echogenic material is identified.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the bilateral lower
extremities.

Sinus rhythm. Left ventricular hypertrophy. Since the previous
tracing the rate
is faster.

  MR CERVICAL SPINE  [**2166-5-31**] 2:33 AM

MR CERVICAL SPINE

Reason: Please eval cord compression/injury

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
17 year old man with sensory motor loss following trampoline
accident w/ evidence SCI on CT
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please eval cord compression/injury
EXAM: MRI of the cervical spine.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with sensory motor loss following
accident, for further evaluation.

TECHNIQUE: T1, T2 and inversion recovery sagittal and T2 axial
images of the cervical spine were acquired. Correlation was made
with the cervical spine CT examination of [**2166-5-31**].

FINDINGS: At C4-5 level, there is increased signal seen within
the interspinous ligament and disruption of the ligament
identified. Additionally, subtle increased signal is seen
anteriorly at this level. There is mild focal loss of lordosis
seen at this level in the cervical spine curvature.
Additionally, there is diffuse bulging of the disc and disc
herniation seen at this level indenting the spinal cord. The
spinal cord demonstrates increased signal with areas of
increased signal at this level and extending slightly superiorly
and inferior to this level. Additionally, foci of low signal are
identified within the spinal cord on T2-weighted images
indicative of blood products. These findings indicate spinal
cord contusion.

At other levels in the cervical region, no evidence of disc
herniation seen. No spinal stenosis seen. The facet joints are
well aligned in the cervical region. Increased signal is seen in
the posterior soft tissues secondary to trauma.

IMPRESSION: Findings indicative of disruption of the
interspinous ligament at C4-5 level with possible partial
interruption of the posterior longitudinal ligament. Disc
protrusion at C4-5 level indenting the spinal cord. Signal
changes within the spinal cord indicative of spinal cord
contusion. No evidence of facet joint malalignment. The injury
may be unstable. The findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1022**] at
the time of interpretation of the study on [**2166-5-31**].
