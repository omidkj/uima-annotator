cxr [**2114-10-29**]: FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest radiographs.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. No pneumothoraces are
identified. Right pleural tube has been removed. Right-sided
pleural effusion/atelectasis appears unchanged. Left-sided
streaky atelectasis is also likely. Remainder of the lungs
appears clear.

IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax status post removal of right chest
tube. Stable right-sided pleural effusion/atelectasis.

CT scan: [**2114-10-26**]
IMPRESSION:

1. Large right-sided hemothorax, including an acute hematoma in
the right lower anterior intrapleural space.

2. Associated collapse of the right middle and lower lobes.

3. Prior right-sided rib fractures with callus formation, but
also a nondisplaced right lower anterior seventh rib fracture,
as well as questionable irregularities of the costal portions of
the anterior right tenth and eleventh ribs.

4. Mildly prominent new right hilar lymph node, with multiple,
similar, calcified right hilar lymph nodes, but no evidence of
lung mass.

5. Status post stent graft placement within the infrarenal
aorta, which is occluded, as before. Two aortofemoral bypass
grafts are patent, however.

6. Similar abnormal thickening of the presacral soft tissues, as
well as thickening of the rectosigmoid colon.

7. Small indeterminant hypoattenuating nodule associated with
the distal duodenum or perhaps the uncinate pancreas, with two
year stability already shown by prior CT.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt reports tripping and falling over electrical cord on [**2114-10-23**]
and presented to Er w/ desaturation and right lower leg
swelling, right knee pain, right head /eye echymosis, and right
rib pain.
Of note, pt on asa and plavix at home.
chest Ct scan showed there was an acute, nondisplaced, fracture
of the right lateral seventh rib, slightly superior to the site
of intrapleural hematoma.
Remainder of Ct scans were unremarkable for acute processes-
including, head, abd, pelvis- see results section.
Pt was taken to the OR [**2114-10-26**] for right VATS evacuation of
hematoma. OR and immed post op courses were unremarkable . Pt
was [**Last Name (un) 1815**] reg diet, pain was well controlled on po percocet. Her
major post op issue was ongoing increased demand for oxygen w/
ambulation. O2 sat at rest was 94% on 2 liters with desaturation
to 85% on 6 liters of oxygen with slight activity. Pt had CTA to
r/o pulmonary embolism- negative.
d/c'd to rehab for ongoing pulmonary hygiene.
