Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4052**]
Chief Complaint:
lethargy, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  intubation x2
2.  exploratory laparotomy
3.  placement of R internal jugular venous catheter
4.  placement of femoral line
5.  placement of PICC line

History of Present Illness:
Pt was brought to the ED with mental status changes/lethargy,
nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain.  He was unable to give much
of a history given his mental status.  He had been vomiting and
unable to keep food down for the past several days, but cannot
give more specific details.

In the ED, he was found to have a BP of 50/40, with a lactate of
8.1, with guaiac positive stool and acute renal failure
(baseline Cr 0.4, Cr on admission 3.9).  In addition, his WBC
count was 12.9.  The MUST protocol was initiated, and pt was
intubated.  As there was concern for intraabdominal infection as
source of sepsis, pt was taken for an exploratory laparotomy.

Past Medical History:
1.  pituitary tumor, now panhypopit
2.  seizure disorder
3.  hypothyroidism
4.  GERD
5.  hypercholesterolemia
6.  legally blind

Social History:
He is single, smokes 1.5 to 2ppd, and abstains, after previous
problems with alcoholism 11 years ago. He is a housing manager.

CT abdomen/pelvis [**6-3**]:
IMPRESSION: 1) No evidence of an acute pathologic process in the
abdomen or pelvis on extremely limited examination without oral
or intravenous contrast. Evaluation of the bowel for ischemia or
other pathologic process is particularly limited.
2) Dilatation of the proximal small bowel with normal-caliber
distal small bowel and colon. This appearance is nonspecific but
may be seen in early ileus.
3) Ectatic infrarenal aorta with maximal AP diameter of 2.5 cm.
4) Diverticulosis.
5) Probable left renal cyst. If there are no outside prior
studies to document stability, further evaluation may be
performed by ultrasound.

echo [**6-4**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

[**2201-6-10**] CXR: Worsening bibasilar atelectasis/consolidation and
right pleural effusion.

[**2201-6-11**] CXR: IMPRESSION: NG tube terminating in right upper
quadrant. Increasing opacity in the left lower lobe, which may
represent atelectasis, however, pneumonia cannot be totally
excluded.

[**2201-6-15**] CXR: Bibasilar pulmonary opacities, which could be
secondary to effusion or atelectasis. Stable appearance of mild
prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature.

Brief Hospital Course:
Note: Hospital course written by floor resident, with
information gleaned from chart regarding SICU and MICU stay but
without the benefit of input from caretakers from these units.

1.  sepsis - Pt initially presented with fatigue/mental status
changes, hypotension, acidosis, acute renal failure, and a
lactate of 8.1.  In the ED, the MUST protocol was initiated, and
the pt was intubated and transiently placed on levophed.
Lactate decreased over 4 hours to 2.  Broad spectrum antibiotics
were given - levo/flagyl/vanco.  Concern was for peritonitis,
and pt was emergently taken to OR on [**6-3**] for an exploratory
laparotomy.  No source of peritonitis was found; there was some
purulent peritoneal fluid, which did not grow any
microorganisms, and dusky-appearing, but viable, bowel; the
duskiness was thought to be due to hypoperfusion in setting of
sepsis.  Pt was taken to the SICU and followed.  He was
extubated on [**6-4**], then reintubated on [**6-5**] due to mental status
decline and hypoxia, as below.  He was transferred to the MICU.
For the remainder of pt's hospitalization, he was
hemodynamically stable and did not display further septic
physiology.

2.  respiratory failure - Extubation was attempted a couple of
times, which failed.  Sputum cultures were unrevealing.  Pt
continued a course of vanc/levo/flagyl, and then
vanc/ceftaz/flagyl.  Vanco was ultimately continued for 17 days,
levo for about 10 days, and flagyl for about 12 days.
Ceftazidime was on board for 5 days.  Pt was noted to have RLL
collapse on CXR, and areas of consolidation vs atelectasis on
CXR.  However, no microorganisms were isolated in sputum (save
for MRSA, 2+ on [**6-14**] sputum, thought perhaps to be a colonizer).
Concern for increased secretions prompted consideration of trach
placement, but pt was able to be extubated successfully.  He was
given an incentive spirometer, and pt was placed on nebs. Since
extubation, pt has been doing quite well from a respiratory
standpoint, sats in 96-97% on room air.

3.  hyponatremia - Pt was noted to develop hyponatremic around
[**2201-6-12**].  Initially it was thought that he was hypovolemic, but
with fluids, sodium did not correct.  Endocrine was consulted,
particularly as pt has h/o panhypopituitarism.  Urine and serum
osms were sent, the results of which were consistent with SIADH.
 Pt was free water restricted, and sodium was monitored.  His
mental status remained stable after transfer to the floor.  On
discharge, his sodium had improved to 129.  Pt should continue
on fluid restriction to 1L while he is at rehab.

4.  seizure disorder - Pt was placed on IV dilantin starting on
[**6-18**].  This was switched to po dilantin.  Levels were checked
and were found to be low.  However, steady state takes about
7-10 days to reach; therefore, pt is currently on 100mg po tid,
and levels should be checked again on [**6-25**] to determine whether
an increased dose is needed (goal level: [**11-26**]).  He will
continue on Dilantin 100 mg PO TID.

5.  anemia - Pt's Hct remained stable without evidence of GI
bleed or other source of bleed.  Workup revealed that this was
most consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  Hct was
monitored, and remained stable.

6.  panhypopituitarism - pt was maintained on low dose
prednisone, per outpatient regimen, of 5mg po bid.  Also was
continued on synthroid.  Of note, TSH has been <0.02, but this
was checked in the setting of acute illness.  Pt had repeat TSH
checked just prior to di
