PHYSICAL EXAM ON PRESENTATION:  Blood pressure 150/100,
respiratory rate 28, pulse 84, and oxygen saturation 88 on
room air, and 100% when oxygen was started.  General:  Alert,
confused, oriented only to person.  HEENT:  Right
temporal-orbital hematoma with brisk bleeding.  Pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light color.  Lungs are clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  No crackles, rhonchi, or
wheezes.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  There is
a well-healed midline incision.  Right upper extremity with
obvious deformity and laceration, palpable radial [**4-16**]
bilateral UE's, IE motor.

LABORATORIES:  White blood cells 18.7, hematocrit 34.4,
platelets 332.  Chem-7 is unremarkable with a BUN of 21 and
creatinine of 1.0.  Lactate 1.8.  Urinalysis showed moderate
leukocyte esterase, small blood, [**2-14**] red blood cells and
[**11-1**] white blood cells.  Urine tox was negative.  Blood tox
negative.

Chest x-ray showed no pneumothorax.  Pelvis x-ray showed
right femoral neck fracture and right inferior ramus
fracture, and a questionable left inferior ramus fracture.

Head CT scan:  No bleed, no mass, and no shift, but positive
for supraorbital hematoma.

Right wrist:  Distal radius fracture.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 89-year-old woman
resident of a nursing home who fell out of bed onto her face
presented with right hip, right ramus, and right wrist
fractures.  For right femoral neck fracture, she underwent
right hemiarthroplasty on [**2180-11-15**] with rodding of the
femur shaft and subsequent therapy with Lovenox.  Distal
right radial fracture was treated with reduction.  Old T6-T11
fractures, Neurosurgery evaluated the patient and recommended
no surgery.

The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit, where
she developed respiratory failure requiring intubation.  The
most likely etiology for the respiratory failure is
congestive heart failure secondary to having received blood
transfusions.  Her hospital course was also complicated by
left pneumothorax.  Subsequently, her course was complicated
by difficulty in weaning her off the ventilator.  She also
developed a non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with a troponin
leak of 5.3, however, ejection fraction was found to be
normal.  She also developed a urinary tract infection, which
was treated with ceftazidime, Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and
imipenem.

Upon successful extubation, she was transferred to the floor,
where, however, she developed a bronchitis with very thick
secretions and which was unable to clear.  She then once
again developed respiratory distress most likely caused by
mucus plugging which was resilient to treatment with
guaifenesin, Mucomyst, and nebulizer treatments.

She was continued on antibiotics for her cellulitis, but her
overall status continued to decline.  Upon discussion with
the patient's niece, who is her closest relative, it was
decided to make her [**Name (NI) 3225**].  The patient was therefore, made [**Name (NI) 3225**]
and started on Morphine drip.  She died on [**2180-12-14**].
