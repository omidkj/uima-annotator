LABS ON ADMISSION:

WBC 16.1

LABS ON TRANSFER FROM ICU:

135 / 101 / 36
===============< 134
4.0 / 25 / 0.9

CBC 18.9 > 11.0 / 31.3 < 94

Ca: 7.2 Mg: 2.3 P: 2.7

LABS ON DISCHARGE:

EKG: Vpaced @70, STD I, AVF, unchanged from prior on [**2111-8-7**]

CXR [**8-26**]: The pacemaker leads terminate in right atrium and
right ventricle, unchanged. There is interval decrease in the
left pleural effusion with still present area of left basal
atelectasis. The left upper lung and the right lung are
unremarkable. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. Overall,
the lung volumes are lower than on the prior radiograph that
might be explained by suboptimal inspiratory effort.

CT Torso [**8-25**]: Large right-sided retroperitoneal hematoma,
stable bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right,
patient appears anemic and may be hypovolemic as indicated by a
spleen, which is smaller than on prior study, and a narrowed
IVC. IVC filter in unusual position with the distal aspect at
the level of the iliac vein bifurcation. Extensive stool within
the colon and fluid within the stomach, but no evidence for
bowel obstruction. Stable pulmonary nodule. Stable spine
degenerative changes and compression fractures and chronic right
posterior rib fracture.

CT Head. [**2111-8-25**]. IMPRESSION: Status post left parietooccipital
craniotomy with small hyperdense focus at the margin of the
resection bed, corresponding to the enhancing focus on the most
recent study, which may represent residual tumor, as suggested
previously. Otherwise, there is no hemorrhage or other acute
process.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Retroperitoneal bleed: Patient was initially hypotensive upon
arrival to the hospital shortly after falling at his nursing
home and was found on CT to have a large retroperitoneal bleed.
Hematocrit on admission was 19.3 and hit a nadir of 18.6 shortly
after admission. Patient has MDS with baseline HCT of 30. He was
trasnfused a total of 9 units PRBCs in the MICU. He did not
require a procedure to stop the bleed. His lovenox and
antihypertensives were held.

2. Leukocytosis: He had an elevated WBC reaching 23.0 on the day
of admission, likely related to a stress response and ?UTI in
the setting of chronic steroid use and malignancy. Initial UA
showed > 50 WBCs and positive leukocytes and nitrites. Notably,
the patient had been on a suppressive macrodantin which had been
stopped a few weeks prior to admission. He had no other clear
source of infection. Blood cultures were negative. He was
treated with 2 days of Levaquin which was stopped when his urine
culture grew out yeast.

3. Acute Renal Failure: Patient was in acute renal failure when
admitted with a creatinine at 1.7 from baseline of 1.0. This was
most likely due to his pre-renal etiology in the setting of an
acute bleed. His creatinine resolved with resolution of his
bleed and correction of his volume status. His creatinine on
discharge was 0.9.

4. Recent History of DVT: The patient was recently admitted for
a DVT and has had an IVC filter placed. In addition he was on
Lovenox, which was held on the current admissions. Given his
severe risk of internal bleeding, it was decided to permanently
discontinue his Lovenox on discharge.

5. Positive U/A: On admission patient was found to have a
positive UA showed > 50 WBCs and positive leukocytes and
nitrites. Patient was asymptomatic and notably has lived with an
indwelling catheter for several months. He was treated with 2
days of Levaquin which was stopped when his urine culture grew
out yeast.

5. PICC Line: A PICC line was placed for access and proper
placement was confirmed on CXR.

6. Brain Metastesis: Patient known to have a brain metastesis of
adenocarcinoma of unknown origin. Patient was undergoing
cyberknife evaluation the day he was admitted. During his
admission he was continued on dexamethasone and gabapentin

7. CHF and AF: Patient has a history of CHF with EF of 40-45% in
[**2108**] and PAF. Patient is s/p AICD. During this admission this
patient was monitored for arrythmias, and transufused blood to
maintain a goal hematocrit above 30. Patient remained in NSR
across his admission. He is currently controlled on amiodarone.

8. HTN: Patient was admitted on daily doses of Carvedilol and
Lasix, both of which were initially held in the setting of acute
bleed. The carvedilol was initially restarted at half his home
dose, with good effect, and then resumed to his normal dose.
Lasix was restarted. The patient was discharged on all of his
home cardiac medications.

9. Code Status: Per discussions with patient's family, this
patient was considered DNR but not DNI. His wishes are only to
be intubated only if it is considered likely that his would make
a relatively rapid recovery.

10. MRSA Status: MRSA screen on admission was positive. Patient
was placed on contact precautions. Specific MRSA treatment was
not initiated at this time.

11. Wound Care: Wound care recommendations from this patient's
previous admission were followed. No new complications
developed.
