Latex / Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization [**2179-12-5**]

History of Present Illness:
80 yo female with hx of CHF (EF 25-30%), HLD, HTN, DMII who
presented to OSH with CP and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for PCI
after catheterization found 70% LAD lesion and pt refused CABG.
Pt states that she has had CP for the last month, however her CP
got significantly worse 3 days PTA to OSH, prompting her
presentation. She describes it as substernal and radiating to
the arms and with associated nausea. Per pt, pain improved with
nitroglycerin. Pt denies any associated SOB, vomiting or
diaphoresis. On presentation to the OSH, she was ruled out for
MI however troponins were mildly elevated to 0.13. She was also
found to be hyperkalemic and was therefore given kayexalate, ARF
with creatinine to 1.5. She underwent cardiac cath which showed
80% proximal left main stenosis, 70% middle LAD stenosis, 60%
proximal circ stenosis and 60% mid-RCA stenosis and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management and PCI given pts
refusal of CABG.

Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on heparin. In the ambulance, pt
complained of CP and pressures dropped to 80s systolic however
normalized without intervention. On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], pt
required 4L to maintain sats in the 90s, however denied SOB, or
CP. Vitals were otherwise stable. She denied further CP or SOB
on arrival to the floor. Without complaints however wanting to
sit up in bed and somewhat agitated.

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain
at present, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. She
does have trouble lying flat because of SOB.

TTE [**12-3**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with severe global hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle, but apical
images are suboptimal. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-1**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular cavity
enlargement with severe global hypokinesis. Right ventricular
cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation.

CXR [**12-5**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. The left basal retrocardiac parenchymal opacities,
unchanged in
extent and density. The left pectoral pacemaker obliterates the
left
costophrenic sinus, but an effusion may also be present on the
left. The
pre-existing right hilar enlargement is slightly less obvious
than on the
previous examination. The finding should nevertheless be
clarified with CT.

Unchanged right-sided PICC line, unchanged pacemaker wires. No
focal
parenchymal opacities have newly occurred. No signs of
overhydration.

ABI [**12-3**]:
Normal lower extremity arterial hemodynamics at rest. Note of
noncompressible vessels.

Cardiac Catheterization:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Sucecssful stenting of the LMCA into the LCX with two
overlapping Cypher DESs
3. Successful placement of TandemHeart assist device during LMCA
PCI
4. Successful removal of bilateral arterial sheaths (3 Perclose
devices
to the RCFA and one 6 F Angioseal to the LCFA).
5. Sucecssful removal of bilateral venous sheaths
6. Mild abdominal aortic plaquing without critical stenosis
7. Limited vagal event following closure of arterial
access,successfully treated
8. 2 weeks of 150 mg/d Plavix then 75 mg daily long term
9minimum of 1 year) and ASA indifinitely (325 mg daily x minimum
of 1 month then 162 mg daily)
9. Global cardiovascular risk reduction strategies to meet
recommended targets


Brief Hospital Course:
1. CORONARIES: Mrs [**Known lastname **] was found to have significant 3
vessel disease at the outside hospital and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for PCI.  She developed chest pain and hypotension en
route to [**Hospital1 **] which resolved without intervention prior to
arrival. PCI was initally on hold given pts poor resp status,
however resp status improved with lasix and she underwent LMCA
stenting with DES using tandem heart support.  She was
transferred to the CCU after stenting for further montioring,
however did well and was quickly transferred to the cardiology
floor.  She was also maintained on aspirin, Imdur, heparin and
high dose statin.  Plavix was started after intervention and
will be continued at 150 mg for 1 week, then pt will require
lifelong treatment of 75 mg/day.  High dose aspir
