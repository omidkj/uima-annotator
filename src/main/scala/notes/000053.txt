Service:  [**Doctor Last Name 1181**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female
with a history of restrictive lung disease, diastolic
congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, obstructive
sleep apnea who developed upper respiratory symptoms two days
prior to admission.  Mildly productive cough.  No fevers,
chills.  No pain.  No shortness of breath.  No nausea,
vomiting.  No dysuria.  No pharyngitis.  No stiff neck.  No
headache.  Had apparently been lethargic for approximately
three days.

On day of admission patient's daughter spoke with her on the
phone and noticed her to be extremely lethargic and falling
asleep while on the phone speaking with her.  Patient's
daughter called 9-1-1 and emergency medical services found
patient oriented times three with oxygen saturations of 50%
on room air.

In the Emergency Department patient's O2 sats were 84% on 6
liters nonrebreather mask.  Chest x-ray revealed a right
lower lobe infiltrate.  Was given Albuterol nebulizers times
two, Solu-Medrol 125 times one, Rocephin 1 gram intravenously
times one, and Clindamycin 600 mg intravenously times one,
and subsequently transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit for noninvasive ventilation.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit patient was placed on
continuous positive air pressure for improved oxygenation and
CO2 exchange.  Was treated with Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone
for the pneumonia.  She was additionally given Albuterol and
Atrovent inhalers to improve pulmonary function and given
Lasix for diuresis as patient was mildly overloaded on chest
x-ray.  Code was discussed and was made "Do Not Resuscitate"/
"Do Not Intubate."  It was subsequently called out to the
floor.

LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  ABG 7.29/83/95 on CPAP.
Chem-7:  Sodium 141, potassium 4.1, chloride 105, bicarbonate

0.07.  Urinalysis within normal limits.

A chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe infiltrate with
cardiomegaly.  Chest x-ray done on [**2111-3-15**] showed right
lower lobe pneumonia, mild cardiac failure, left pleural
effusion.  Chest x-ray on [**2111-3-16**] showed slight
improvement in right lower lobe consolidation, improving left
retrocardiac opacity, and slight decrease in left pleural
effusion.  Chest x-ray on [**2111-3-17**] showed progression of
right upper lobe opacity; stable right lower lobe and left
lower lobe consolidation; improving left pleural effusion;
persistent uppers on vascular redistribution.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Hypercarbic respiratory failure:  Ms. [**Known lastname 32729**] was
admitted directly to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
management of her hypercarbic respiratory failure with
noninvasive ventilation.  She is a chronic CO2 retainer
ranging from 50s to 110s on her CO2. Serial arterial blood
gases were checked to monitor her progress.

On her initial presentation her Chem-7 and ABG were
consistent with her respiratory acidosis without metabolic
compensation and with hypoxia.  No anion gap.  She was
started on Solu-Medrol 100 mg t.i.d., then changed to
Prednisone 60 mg q. day upon discharge to the floor.

The patient was initially improving on BiPAP as noted on
ABGs.  However, she did not tolerate BIPAP and refused to
continue with it.  An agreement was made between patient and
team to keep face mask and nasal cannula during the periods
that she was off the BiPAP.  She did so through the remainder
of her MICU stay.  She was started on antibiotics in the MICU
for treatment of her pneumonia.  They used Rocephin and
Azithromycin to treat her community-acquired pneumonia.  It
is very likely that this development of pneumonia may have
been the cause of her hypercarbic respiratory failure.

In addition, patient was noted to be somewhat volume
overloaded on subsequent exams in the MICU and was also noted
to have some congestion on chest x-ray.  She was started on
Lasix 20 mg intravenously b.i.d. in the MICU to assist with
diuresis and resolution of her pulmonary edema.

Patient was then transferred to the floor and she continued
to refuse the BiPAP and CPAP assistance.  Patient
additionally refused any other antibiotic medications on the
last day of her MICU stay as she was called out to the floor.
That was hospital day five.

Team, nursing, and Attending had a meeting to the patient to
address her refusal of oxygen and medication management.
Patient was convinced to keep oxygen at 2 liters throughout
the remainder of her stay and also agreed to continue taking
her medications to improve her pneumonia.  Repeat chest
x-rays showed improvement of pneumonia and some of her
pulmonary congestion.

Whenever patient was off the oxygen patient would have
episodes of agitation and confusion.  Prior to her discharge
patient's mentation sensorium was improved, pneumonia was
under treatment, and volume overload was significantly
improved.

2.  Diastolic dysfunction:  Patient was noted to be in
pulmonary edema and was volume overloaded on exam with an
elevated jugulovenous pressure on subsequent exams in the
MICU.  Patient was started on 20 mg intravenous Lasix b.i.d.
until euvolemic.  Euvolemia was asse
