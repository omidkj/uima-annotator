wheezes, mild LLQ pain to deep palpation but no rebound or
guarding, and no pedal edema. He was last dialyzed yesterday per
his usual schedule. Sent to ED for evaluation, and recommended
palliative care evaluation given multiple recent
hospitalizations and difficulties at home.
.
ED eval notable for O2sat 79% on RA that improved to 84% on 4L.
Thought to be volume overloaded / CHF based on CXR and given
40IV lasix with some urine output, nitro, started on BiPAP with
improvement O2sat to 96%. Labs with WBC 124k without left shift
(most recent baseline ~100k), Hct 30.2 (at baseline), lactate

CXR [**2141-2-4**]:
Bilateral pulmonary edema has significantly progressed in the
interval, currently being at least moderate accompanied by
pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The right internal jugular
line tip terminates in the mid-SVC.


Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo man with a history of ESRD on HD, emphysema and
interstitial lung disease on home 2LNC, untreated CLL, RCC s/p
nephrectomy, prostate cancer, bladder cancer who was sent to the
ED from PCP's office for hypoxia and admitted to the ICU.
.
# Hypoxia: Patient with fluid overload in physical exam and on
CXR upon presentation in a very labile patient with COPD, ILD
with posibly increased blood viscosity in the setting of
leukocytosis. Patient was admitted to the ICU for close
monitorina and NIPPV support. Patient was ruled out for MI with
serial ECGs and negative cardiac enzymes. Of note, patient had
normal echocardiogram 4 months ago without evidence of diastolic
dysfunction. Patient did not meet [**Location (un) 47**] criteria for HF.
There were no focal signs or symptoms to suggest infection and
CXR did not show consolidation, but showed pulmonary edema
without any cardiomegaly. BNP was not available on presentation.
Patient had blood and sputum cultures, which have been negative
so far. Non-invasive positive pressure support was performed
with BiPAP and attempt of fluid removal with lasix was done.
Patient did not tolerated BiPAP, because he was feeling
uncomfortable. Renal was consulted and patient underwent HD with
3 L of fluid removed the day after admission. Extra UF session
was performed during hospitalization with 3 L removed.
Albuterol, fluticasone and ipratropium therapies were continued.
Target SpO2 was 88-92 Sp02%. Within 30 hours patient was
breathing comfortably on 4 L NC and was transfered to the
medicine floor. Patient was discharged home on 3 L NC.
.
# Dark stools: h/o diverticulosis but guaiac neg in ED and Hct
at baseline. [**Month (only) 116**] be due to iron supplementation. Active T&S.
Daily Hct. Epo supplementation at HD.
.
# Anemia: Guaiac negative stools and CBC compatible with renal
failure. Will continue EPO at HD with target Hgb [**9-29**].
.
# ESRD on HD: HD T,Th,Sat [**Location (un) **] [**Location (un) **], followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 118**]. Received 2 HD sessions and one extra UF while inpatient.
.
# Hypertension: Well controlled, continued amlodipine.
.
# CLL: Diagnosed [**2131**]. WBC slightly above most recent baseline
on admission. S/p incomplete treatment with rituximab.
Contact[**Name (NI) **] outpatient Oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 22656**] via email to notify
of inpatient/ICU stay and she will follow as outpatient for
possible treatment of CLL.
.
# Hypogammaglobulinemia: IgG of 298 (normal= [**Telephone/Fax (1) 25219**]) on last
check [**12-26**]. ? whether due to recent rituximab therapy. Does
place pt at risk for infection. Reluctant to use IVIG in past
given concerns for CHF. Received flu shot prior to admission.
Monitored closely for evidence of infection. Contact[**Name (NI) **] heme-onc
to consider trial IVIG while inpatient, but it was decided that
benefit would be minimal and would be large volume load.
.
# Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine.  Last TSH [**2142-1-15**]
2.8.
.
# Depression: Distressed by declining health and social problems
at home. SW consult placed. Continued home citalopram.
.
# RCC: s/p R nephrectomy [**2131**].
.
# Bladder CA x 2: s/p chemo [**2134**].
.
# Prostate cancer in situ: s/p XRT [**2132**] and transurethral
resection 5/[**2140**]. Continued home terazosin.
.
# IBS: continued dicyclomine, fiber supplements.
.
# FEN: low Na diet.

# PPx: Heparin sc. PPI. Bowel regimen

# ACCESS: tunneled RIJ HD line. PIV.

# CODE: DNR/DNI, palliative care consult
