Date of Birth:  [**2099-5-5**]             Sex:   F

Service: [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

Allergies:
Penicillins / Percocet / Iodine; Iodine Containing

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
anaphylaxis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
elective revascularization of femoral stent

History of Present Illness:
50yo F with a h/o CAD, severe PVD, s/p thoracic aorta
replacement, COPD, and severe hyperlipidemia admitted to CCU
after attempt at revascularization of femoral stent complicated
by anaphylactic reaction. Visipaque dye was injected and shortly
after pt developed anxiety, increased HR, facial edema, and
erythema/flushing. Pt's sBP's when down to the 60's. She was
given 1 amp of epinephrine with subsequent sBP's into the 200's
and tachycardia. Propofol bolus and gtt and nitro gtt and sBP's
decreased again. Nitro was stopped and propofol was decreased
and neosynephrine was initiated with IVF. Pt also received
solumedrol 125 IV , Benadryl 50, and Pepcid. She was transferred
to the CCU for monitoring overnight.

Pt underwent a peripheral catheterization on [**2149-12-5**] due to
critical limb ischemia.  This revealed total occlusion of the
distal SFA, for which she received a stent: overlapping 5.0x30mm
Precise and 7.0x100mm and 7.0x38mm Dynalink stents. This
intervention followed a failed femoral popliteal bypass in
[**2149**].  Her symptoms returned and she was referred for angiogram
of this limb with likely revascularization. She reports
bilateral leg pain, right greater than left for many years.  The
pain is predominantly in the back of her
calves.  The onset of the pain is after a half a block.  She
reports bilateral ankle swelling, right greater than left.


Past Medical History:
1. Severe peripheral [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] disease status post right
femoral-popliteal bypass in [**2149-11-1**], now found to be
occluded.
2. Status post thoracic aortic replacement.
3. COPD.
4. CAD with 90% RCA and 60% LAD lesions by recent
catheterization.
5. Severe hyperlipidemia, cholesterol level of about 600 and
triglycerides of approximately 3,000.
6. Insulin dependent diabetes.
7. Hypothyroidism.
8. Hypertension.
9. Pancreatitis.
10. Degenerative joint disease status post laminectomy.
11. Status post cholecystectomy.
12. Status post right femoral embolectomy.
13. Obesity.


Social History:
She admits to a 45 pack year history of tobacco.  She is still
smoking. Pt lives alone. She has 3 children.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 yo woman with severe [**Month/Day/Year 1106**] disease with anaphylaxis during
peripheral catheterization, likely [**2-2**] dye with hemodynamic
instability initially from anaphylactic rxn, then likley from
medications.
1. Anaphylaxis: Pt received airway protection and close
monitoring of hemodynamics O/N. She was intubated and
hemodynamics remained stable. She was given gentle IVF,
solumedrol x 2. She developed no further rashes or erythema.
Swelling resolved. Pt was premidicated with steroids before the
surgery was repeated. She tolerated the procedure well and had
no further anaphylactic response.
2. DM: Pt's Lantus dose was reduced slightly the first evening
of admission since she was NPO. However, BG's were high and chem
7 revealed a slight metabolic acidosis. She was maintained on an
insulin drip for a few hours until BG's were controlled. She was
then resumed on her normal insulin regimen and did well.
3. [**Name (NI) 12296**] Pt underwent the revascularization procedure and
tolerated it well. Initial angiography demonstrated occlusion of
the distal SFA at the origin of the stents with reconstitution
distally to the stent via collaterals.  Heparin was initiated.
  A 7F [**Last Name (un) 12297**] sheath was taken over the [**Doctor Last Name 534**] over a Supracore
wire.  The
lesion was crossed with some difficulty with a PT [**Name (NI) 9165**]
intermediate
wire and an Angled Glidewire.  Significant and prolonged
atherectomy was
performed with the 7.5 Silverhawk with an excellent result.  A 5
x 40 mm
Polarcath (distal stent) balloon and 7.0 x 40 mm Polarcath (mid
and
proximal stent) were used to deliver cyrotherapy to the stented
area.
IA TNG was given to resolve some wire induced spasm of the AT.
  Final angiography demonstrated <10% residual, no dissection,
and
excellent flow into the distal vessel. The pt had slight pain in
her legs which improved by the time she was d/c'd to home.
4. CAD - continued outpt medications.
5. Anxiety - continued buproprion. Ativan prn.
