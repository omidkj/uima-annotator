History of Present Illness:
76 yo male w/ vague PMH of arrhythmia presents after being found
down by his family. Patient was apparently found by family in
the basement after being down for an unknown period of time
(hours?). They were unable to get him upstairs so they brought a
mattress down into the basement. The daughter slept down in the
basement with him overnight and at around 5 am he was calling
out for watter but did not seem to recognize her. The family
called the [**Doctor First Name **] Scientist nurse advisor who told them that
they were legallly bound to call the ambulance in the state of
MA. EMS found him to be unresponsive w/ GCS 5 and a FS of 20 on
the scene; he received an amp of D50. When the patient arrived
in the ED his vitals were as follows: T 78.9 F/26.1 C, HR 93, BP
86/55, RR 14, sat 94% on face mask. He was intubated and started
on warm O2 in attempt to warm him. He was also noted to be
coagulopathic with an INR of 7.7. He received 3 U PRBCs, 2 [**Location 70589**], 6 [**Location 16678**] and Vit K 10 mg SC x 1. Also, was started
empirically on broad spectrum abx - vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and
flagyl - and a dose of dexamethasone 10 mg IV x 1. He was
started on a levophed gtt for blood pressure support. He had a
FAST exam which noted free fluid in the abdomen, but it was
unclear if this blood or ascites. He also went to the OR and was
going to get warmed via ECMO. Since his temp was up to 85 F at
that time, the surgeons decided against this, but a L subclavian
cordis was placed. Swanned in MICU and found to have high right
sided pressures and waveforms c/w severe TR. Echo confirmed
3+TR.

.
CXR [**2170-1-3**]:
1. No evidence of definite parenchymal consolidation. Unchanged
appearance to pleural effusions and interstitial pulmonary
edema.
2. Endotracheal tube approximately 8 cm from carina, recommend
repositioning. Swan-Ganz catheter tip likely within right
ventricle.
.
CT CHEST/ABDOMEN [**2170-1-3**]:
1. Extremely limited study secondary to artifact.
2. Free fluid seen throughout the abdomen, tracking into the
pelvis, measuring simple fluid density in most areas. Some areas
of higher attenuation fluid measurements are likely secondary to
artifact, although hemoperitoneum cannot be totally excluded.
There is no evidence of layering hematocrit level. No active
extravasation identified.
3. Diffuse anasarca.
4. Large bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis/consolidation.
.
CT HEAD [**2170-1-3**]:
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
.
CT C-SPINE [**2170-1-3**]:
1. No evidence of acute fracture.
2. Cervical spondylosis.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
.
TTE [**2170-1-5**]:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is dilated. There
is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. There is severe global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis and moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis
(ejection fraction 30-40 percent). The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined; there is significant focal
thickening of the noncoronary cusp, suggestive of a vegetation.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.  Compared to previous
study of [**2170-1-4**], the left ventricular ejection fraction
is increased.
.
CT HEAD [**2170-1-8**]:
1. Interval development of large wedge-shaped area of low
attenuation consistent with infarct in the left parietal region.
Numerous other new low- attenuation foci, bilaterally, are also
concerning for infarction, and do not correspond to any
particular vascular territory. This pattern raises concern for
possible watershed infarction rather than embolic or thrombotic
etiology, and should be correlated with history of
shock/hypotension.
2. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
3. Air-fluid levels in the paranasal sinuses, possibly sequela
from intubation and supine positioning.
.

CT CHEST/ABDOMEN [**2170-1-8**]:
1. Extremely limited study due to artifact and lack of
intravenous contrast.
2. Slight interval decrease in large bilateral pleural effusions
with associated bibasilar atelectasis/consolidation.
3. Large amount of low-attenuation fluid throughout the abdomen
tracking into the pelvis. No definite evidence of
retroperitoneal hematoma or acute hemorrhage.
4. Apparent thickening of the wall of the sigmoid and distal
descending colon, incompletely characterized due to lack of
distention with oral contrast, while the rectum appears spared.
In the appropriate clinical context, findings may represent
colitis, either infectious or ischemic given the segments
involved, and may be new since the earlier study.
5. Anasarca, as before.
.
EEG [**2170-1-9**]:
This is an abnormal EEG due to the low voltage, slow background
activity and bursts of generalized slowing. This suggests a
severe encephalopathy, which may be seen with infections,
ischemia, medication effect or toxic metabolic abnormalities. No
epileptiform features were noted. A repeat EEG to evaluate for
evolution would be recommended if patient remains unresponsive.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 76 yo male intially admitted after being found down
with hypothermia, coagulopathy, hypotension, free fluid in
abdomen. Intubated in the ED.
