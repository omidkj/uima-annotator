History of Present Illness:
 55 y.o. female with DM1, HTN, [**Doctor Last Name 933**] and Hepatitis C who
presents with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. Patient is
somewhat tengential and thus history is limited, but as can best
be understood, she noticed the gradual onset of constipation
approximately 2 weeks ago, a symptom that in the past has
suggested the onset of a gastroparesis flare. Over the course of
the following 2 weeks, she developed abdominal pain, reports
BRBPR and "dark stool", though not clearly melena, as well as
intermittent fevers, elevated FS (>600) as high as 104.4 the
night prior to admission. On the night prior to admission, she
developed nausea/[**Doctor Last Name **] and describes a coffee-ground emesis.
She denies any [**Doctor Last Name **] contacts, recent travel, or consumption of
poorly-cooked food. She says that her current symptoms are
consistent with her prior episodes of gastroparesis.
.
Upon presentation to the ED, vitals were notable for
tachycardia, but otherwise normal. Labs were notable for a BG of
754, severe metabolic acidosis with a gap of 34, elevated
lactate, 150 ketones in the urine and a bicarb of 9. She also
had a leukocytosis of 21 (without bands) and acute renal with a
creatinine of 1.9, up from 0.7. A femoral line was placed and
she was given several liters of NS, later switched to 1/2 NS
since a corrected sodium actually revealed hypernatremia. An
insulin drip was also started, initially at 5, then increased to
10. Additionally, NG lavage showed some small clots without
coffee grounds or active bleeding. Rectal exam revealed brown,
guaiac positive stool. UA was negative as was a CXR for signs of
infection. EKG showed sinus tachycardia without ischemic changes
and troponin was negative x 1. Given the elevated lactate,
guaiac positive stool and abdominal pain, a CT abdomen was
obtained (without contrast given renal failure) and though
limited, did not comment on any acute intraabdominal process.
KUB likewise did not show an obstructive pattern, though the
colon was full of stool. Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl were started
empirically to cover a bowel process. Patient was thus admitted
to the ICU for further management of DKA.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, patient was resting in bed, appearing
comfortable, though complaining of "20/10" abdominal pain.

   Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2134-6-17**]):
      STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.    FINAL
SENSITIVITIES.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
         COAG NEG STAPH does NOT require contact precautions,
regardless of
         resistance.
         Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be reported as
also
         RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins,
carbacephems,
         carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

         Rifampin should not be used alone for therapy.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with anion gap of 34 on initial
presentation to the ED with glucose >500, most recently 24.
Started on insulin gtt in ED, lactate elevated at 4.6 which was
downtrending/normal on discharge. CXR negative for infiltrate
and UA without pyuria. EKG without ischemic changes and cardiac
enzymes negative x 1. Most likely etiology to DKA likely
coagulase negative staph bacteremia from femoral line versus
gastroparesis leading to [**Month/Year (2) **] and constipation. Patient was
weaned off of insulin gtt and back to home dosing of insulin.
[**Last Name (un) **] consulted and recommended switching Lantus to 28 [**Hospital1 **].
Patient tolerating full diet at discharge, and Dobhoff was
removed.

#Coagulase Negative Staph Bacteremia: Noted to have 2/2 bottles
of GPCs in clusters and pairs growing from ED blood cultures. No
obvious source of infection (no overt cellulitis, open wounds,
or recent dental cleanings). Blood cultures drawn from femoral
line. No murmurs on exam or stigmata concerning for
endocarditis. Patient has a history of CNS bacteremia ([**2-28**],
[**12-27**], [**9-26**]), and was previously treated in the pat with 14 day
course. TTE showed no evidence of vegetations. Femoral line was
pulled with no growth from tip culture and surveillance cultures
were n
