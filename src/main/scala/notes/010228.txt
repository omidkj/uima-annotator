Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with Cypher stents to proximal Ramus,
mid RCA


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 64 yo M with CAD s/p MI in [**2176**], '[**83**], '[**88**] with
stenting to his RCA in '[**83**], '[**92**] and to his LAD in [**2188**], 2 vessel
CAD per cath in [**2192**], as well as well controlled DM2, HTN,
hyperlipidemia who presents with chest pain. Pt was in his USOH
until this AM doing yard work. The patient experienced [**8-30**]
SSCP with extreme diaphoresis and mild nausea, similar to his
previous heart attacks. The pain did not radiate. The pain was
initially unrelieved by SL nitro x4. The pain resolved by the
time the EMTs arrived, but returned in the ambulance.
.
In the ED, EKG demonstrated 2mm ST elevations in II, III, aVF as
well as in V3-V6. Pt was given ASA, Plavix, heparin gtt,
integrillin gtt, nitro/morphine and taken to the cath lab
urgently.
.
In the cath lab, the patient was found to have 40% mid LAD
stenosis, 90% ostial, 40% mid in-stent mild RCA stenosis. Cypher
stent was placed to ostial RCA requiring rotoblation with
satisfactory result. Patient was also found to have elevated PA,
PCWP and was given Lasix 20mg IV.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient did complain of [**12-31**] chest
pain, much improved from presentation. The patient otherwise
felt well and denied any complaints.
.
On further ROS, the patient had been otherwise well. His last
episode of chest pain was one month ago while at work, relieved
by SL nitro x2. He otherwise denied HA, lightheadedness, f/c,
SOB, PND, orthopnea, red/black stool, easy bruising, bleeding,
or sudden neurological changes.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for 2/10 chest pain, NO
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.


Past Medical History:
1. CAD, status post MI in [**2176**], [**2183**], and [**2188**]. Had a PTCA and
stenting of his RCA in [**2183**]. He had stenting of his distal,
middle, and proximal LAD in [**2189-1-19**]. Cathed in [**2192**] (see
below) s/p Cypher stents to prox Ramus, mid RCA. Exercise MIBI
in [**1-23**] demonstrated good exercise tolerance (9.5 min on [**Doctor First Name **])
w/o ischemic changes, and fixed inferior wall defect.
2. Dyslipidemia: [**3-27**] LDL 66, HDL 47, Chol 148
3. Hypertension.
4. Type 2 diabetes mellitus: [**3-27**] Hgb A1C 6.4%
5. Tinnitus.
6. Anxiety.
7. NASH (negative hepatitis A, B, and C; negative [**Doctor First Name **]).
.
Cardiac Risk Factors: + Diabetes, + Dyslipidemia, + Hypertension

.
Cardiac History: CABG: N/A
.
Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**2192**] anatomy as follows:

Right dominant system. 2 vessel CAD with the LMCA with mild
luminal irregularites. The LAD had mild luminal irregularities
with no flow limitation and a widely patent previously placed
stent. There was a large caliber ramus vessel with a focal 80%
stenosis. The LCx had mild luminal irregularities and no flow
limitations. The RCA had mild diffuse disease with a 40% ostial
stenosis followed by a 50% mid stenosis and a 70% distal lesion
just after the previously placed stent. EF 50% with mild
inferior hypokinesis.
.
Hemodynamic evaluation showed marked elevation of right and left
heart filling pressures with a RVEDP of 15mmHg and LVEDP of
26mmHg. There was evidence of pumonary HTN with a PAP of
60/22mmHg. The cardiac index was preserved (3.1lt/min/m2).

Pertinent Results:
EKG (in CCU): NSR at 60bpm, nl Axis, 1.5mm ST elevations in II,
III, aVF, TWI in aVL, and resolution of ST elevations in V3-V6

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2197-5-26**] demonstrated:
Mildly dilated left atrium. Normal Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size. Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with focal severe hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior
wall, remaining LV segments contract normally. Normal RV chamber
size and free wall motion. Mildly thickened aortic valve
leaflets without aortic stenosis. No AR. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. Anterior space most likely represents a
fat pad.  Compared with [**2194-1-31**], the inferior wall motion
abnormality is more pronounced.

CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2197-5-26**] demonstrated:
Right dominant, 40% mid LAD stenosis. Patent ramus stent. 90%
ostial RCA stenosis also with 40% mid in-stent restenosis.
HEMODYNAMICS: PCWP mean 26mmHg, RA mean 15 mmHg, PAP 59/22/39

CXR [**2197-5-28**] No evidence of congestive heart failure. Right lower
lobe linear atelectasis most likely due to elevated right
hemidiaphragm.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo M with CAD s/p multiple MIs, s/p multiple stents to RCA,
LAD, ramus, DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia presents with chest pain
and STEMI, s/p cardiac cath and further stenting to ostial RCA.


STEMI: Pt with known CAD with multiple interventions in the
past.  Pt found to have 40% mid LAD stenosis, and 90% ostial,
40% mid in-stent mild RCA stenosis.  Ostial RCA required
rotoblation then Cypher stent was placed. The rest of his stents
were patent. Patient's chest pain resolved.  Still with residual
STEs inferiorly. CEs peaked at CK = 909. He was treated
medically with ASA 325mg daily, plavix 75mg daily, beta blocker
and ACEI as tolerated, and high dose statin.  He is to continue
plavix for at least one year and instructed on the importance of
this.  He is not to stop this medication without first talking
to his cardiologist.

Pump: Echo done post-MI and EF currently depressed at 45% in
setting of STEMI.  He had high PA pressures and PCWP in cath lab
and likely ventricular dysfunction.  He was diuresed until
euvolemic.  He was continued on ACEI.

Rhythm: Patient remained in normal sinus rhythm.
.
Type 2 Diabetes: Last A1C in [**3-27**] 6.4% and relatively controlled
blood glucose. Continued on aggressive HISS while in house.
Restarted glucotrol and Januvia on discharge.

HTN: Switched outpatient BB (carvedilol) to Lopressor a
