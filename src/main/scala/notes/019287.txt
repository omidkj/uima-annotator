TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST DATED [**2194-3-29**]

HISTORY: 55-year-old woman with hyperglycemia; evaluate for
pneumonia.

FINDINGS: Two views are compared with studies dated [**2194-2-4**] and
[**2193-11-18**]; the overall appearance is unchanged. Vague opacity at
the lateral aspect of left lung base, unchanged, likely
corresponds to the prominent paracardiac fat pad, well-seen on
the lateral view. Lung volumes are slightly improved and the
lungs are clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary
vessels are unchanged and there is no pleural effusion.
Incidentally noted are cholecystectomy clips and DISH involving
the thoracic spine.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2194-3-31**]  11:32:30 PM


Sinus rhythm with second degree A-V block (Wenckebach). Left
atrial
abnormality. Right bundle-branch block. Consider prior inferior
myocardial
infarction. Delayed R wave progression with late precordial QRS
transition is
non-specific. QTc interval appears prolonged but it is difficult
to measure.
Since the previous tracing of [**2194-3-29**] second degree A-V block is
now present.

STUDY: PA and lateral chest, [**2194-4-5**].

HISTORY: 55-year-old woman with asthma and increasing cough.

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous study from [**2194-3-29**].

Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal. There is some
streaky densities at the left base which may be due to
atelectasis or early infiltrate. This is more apparent than on
the prior study. No pulmonary edema or pleural effusions are
seen. There are severe degenerative changes seen of the right AC
joint.

PA and lateral upright chest radiograph compared to [**2194-4-5**].

The heart size is mildly enlarged but stable. Mediastinal
contours are unremarkable. The lungs are essentially clear with
no new focal infiltrate demonstrated. The pleural surfaces are
smooth and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process on the
current radiographs. Cardiomegaly.



Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented with hyperglycemic non ketotic state
related to uncontrolled diabetes. Last Hbg A1C of 9.3. Current
hyperglycemia is possibly in the setting of steroid injection in
ortho clinic.  Pt developed BG > 600 and was symptomatic. Sugars
significantly improved on insulin gtt and she was sent to the
floor. [**Last Name (un) **] team followed with daily adjustment of NPH and
sliding scale, particularly after initiation of steroids for
asthma exacerbation. She was switched over from regular to
humalog (lispro) sliding scale. Sugars were fairly controlled
but since patient is on steroids (as noted below), will need
closer [**Last Name (un) 7941**] outpatient.

In the hospital, the patient developed an asthma exacerbation.
This was initially  treated with nebulizers with not much
improvement and so I steroids followed by po steroids started.
CR revealed question of lung infiltrate and so levofloxacin was
started to complete a 7 day course.

Initially, INR was supra therapeutic and so warfarin was held.
Eventually restarted in the hospital. Since she is on
levofloxacin that can interact with warfarin, the dose of latter
was decreased to 4 mg daily and she was asked to follow up for
INR checks with PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**3-2**] days after discharge. INR on day of
discharge was 2.5.

Medications for CAD, HTN, Chronic diastolic HF, depression were
continued.

Dose of gabapentin was reduced to match with renal function.
