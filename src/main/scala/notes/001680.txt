consolidation or vascular congestion in the lungs. There is
persistent blunting of the left costophrenic angle. Osseous
structures are unchanged.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of volume overload.


Brief Hospital Course:
1)Chemical pneumonitis due to chlorine. Pt presented to ED with
unresponsiveness and was intubated for airway protection and
difficulty breathing.  A toxicology consult was obtained and pt
was treated with a course of steroids as per their
recommendations.  After 5 days of mechanical ventillation pt was
extubated without difficulty. There was a minor component of
reactive airway disease and so pt was given tiotropium and
Advair.  Because he has no history of COPD and was previously
without respiratory compromise, tiotropium was discontinued.  As
he continued to have mild wheeze, Advair was continued with
instrution to discontinue after one more week.

2)Possible aspiration pneumonia in addition to pneumonitis: On
arrival to the MICU, there was concern that the pt may have
developed an aspiration pneumonia in the setting of decreased
consciousness. He was treated with 7 day course of antibiotics.


3)Renal failure: Pt had acute renal failure which resolved with
administration of IV fluids.


4)CAD s/p CABG: Continues on home asa/statin/bb.  Confirmed with
pt and PCP that pt is no longer on plavix.
