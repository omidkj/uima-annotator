Chief Complaint:
71M with MDS referred from clinic with exertional dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
71M with MDS, diagnosied in novemeber. Has been feeling better
after starting prednisone, hydroxyurea, and danzol when earlier
this week started feeling poor. Had malaise, night sweats,
subjective fevers, as well as cough. developed SOB on excertion
several days ago, but was concerned when he noticed hematemasis
yesterday. He presented to clinic but had an acute
decompensation going up stairs
with extreme SOB and was sent to ED. It is associated with mild
substernal chest pain, but denies radiation. Has had
diaphoresis, but had been diaphoretic since starting his
medications.
Mr. [**Known lastname 70576**] was in his usual state of health until
approximately [**2173-8-20**] when he noted the insidious onset
of low back pain.  This occurred while he was driving to
[**State 622**].  The pain persisted and he returned to the [**Location (un) 86**]
area.  He was initially seen by his primary care doctor who
noted a white blood count of 14,800 and platelet count of
51,000.  An MRI revealed abnormal bone marrow signal, but no
space-occupying lesion.  He was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 40508**] for
further evaluation.  He was noted to have an increased number of
monocytes.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 40508**] performed a bone marrow aspirate and
biopsy, which revealed a hypercellular marrow for the age.
There was evidence of trilineage dysplasia.  Increased numbers
of monocytes with a left-shifted hematopoiesis.  Megakaryocytes
were present but
with atypical forms.  On CT scan, he was noted to have an
enlarged spleen.  His pain in his low back has continued.
In the ED, the patient had a temp of 100.1, BP 180s/70s, sats in
80s.
ECG demonstrated NSR with a LBBB, (no old for comparison).  WBCs
were 53.3; Gran count [**Numeric Identifier 70577**] and 67 Platelets.  Heme onc
recommended against ASA.  He had a CXR with bilateral opacities
c/w PNA vs. CHF.  He was given Ceftriaxone, steroids, started on
Nitro drip and given 20mg Lasix IV.

ROS: He notes progressive pain in both lower extremities.  He
denies any fevers or night sweats.  Notes increasing fatigue and
easy bruising. Denies any oral lesions, gingival hypertrophy,
cough,or skin lesions

Past Medical History:

Social History:
He has a 40-pack-year history of cigarette smoking, stopped
approximately 15 years ago.  He drinks approximately two drinks
at night.  He worked as a sheet metal cutter.


Family History:
There is no family history of any underlying hematological
disorders.

Physical Exam:
96.6  149/63  69   94% O2 Sats on 4L NC

adenopathy.

ABD: Soft, NT, ND. NL BS.  No HSM; The spleen is palpable, [**5-27**]
cm below the left costal margin, liver edge 2 cm below the right
costal margin.  No ascites, no inguinal lymph  adenopathy, no
testicular masses. Scar from prior appendectomy.
EXT: No edema. 2+ DP pulses BL; Trace ankle edema.  Pulses are
present in both lower extremities.

sensation throughout. 5/5 strength throughout. [**12-21**]+ reflexes,
equal BL. Normal coordination. Gait assessment deferred
PSYCH: Listens and responds to questions appropriately, pleasant

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**11-25**]: COMPARISONS:  There are no prior studies available for
comparison.  The heart is enlarged.  The aorta appears tortuous.
 There are multiple median sternotomy wires at the midline and
multiple small clips overlying the left heart border and
midline.  Bilateral patchy opacities with sparing of the apices
and prominent pulmonary vessels favor pulmonary edema.  However,
there is a rounded area of lucency seen in the right middle lobe
area that could
represent underlying cavitary pneumonia.  There is a small
right-sided pleural effusion.  The patchy opacities obscure the
left costophrenic angle and a left pleural effusion cannot be
completely excluded. IMPRESSION:  Given underlying cardiac
history, CHF is favored. Underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded
on this examination.  Recommend serial follow-up examinations.
.
EKG: NSR with a LBBB
.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 71M with MDS referred from clinic with
exertional dyspnea, hypoxia to the 80s, found to have PNA vs.
CHF on CXR.  He had a brief course in the MICU on admission
given his desaturations.
.
1. Hypoxia:  On CXR, there was a question of pulmonary edema
given rapid interval improvement, however he clinically did not
have signs of CHF.  He was given Lasix in the ED, but he did not
get any more on the floor and improved with only antibiotics.
Thus, his hypoxia was thought to be secondary to community
acquired pneumonia.  He was maintained on Ceftriaxone and
Levaquin and was discharged on a 7 day course of Levaquin and
Cefpodoxime.  Induced sputum culture grew gram negative rods and
gram positive cocci in pairs.  Legionella and PCP were negative.
 Rapid viral was negative, and viral culture was pending at the
time of this discharge summary.  He was requiring 4L NC on
admission to the floor, but was quickly weaned down to room air,
and was satting 98 on RA at the time of discharge.  He should
return to see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] in 3 days for a sat check and to assure
he is doing well.
