Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
 This is a 69 yo M with a history of COPD, CAD s/p CABG, HTN,
Etoh abuse who presents with dyspnea. At baseline patient
requires 3L of O2. However he complains that over the last [**2-28**]
weeks he has had chills, worsening cough, and shortness of
breath. He produces a small amount of sputum. He has also had
new lower extremity edema over this time. He notices that he
doesn't sleep well because he has to wake up 2-3 times per night
to urinate.
He mentions that over a longer period of time he has had a
general decline in his health. His shortness of breath has
gotten worse, where he can't leave the house to do activities as
a result. He uses his albuterol inhaler 5-6 times per day.
Patient mentions that his balance has been off, and his wife
complains that he has become more forgetful over the last 6
months. He also complains of black stools x several months.
Denies abdominal pain or BRBPR.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.6 P82 BP124/69 R20 O2 sat 95%
on 3L. Patient was given 60mg po prednisone, 500mg po
azithromycin, Albuterol nebs x3, 40mg IV lasix. An ABG was done
7.44/39/55. This was thought to be a VBG. His CXR was without
acute process. He was started on Bipap. Vitals prior to transfer
were HR 84 BP 127/75 RR 21 95% on Bipap with Peep of 5, FiO2
30%.
.
On the floor, patient is no longer requiring Bipap is on home 3L
NC, and feels markedly improved. Denies any pain or discomfort.
Pt ruled out CEs x3, and improved with steroids, albuterol nebs,
as pt had likely COPD flare. Now stable and called out to floor.

Final Report
PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**2176-1-28**] AT 1529 HOURS.

HISTORY: Dyspnea on exertion.

COMPARISON: Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**2174-11-6**].

FINDINGS: Similar to the prior exam, there is evidence of prior
median
sternotomy and CABG. Numerous fractured sternal wires are again
present and
unchanged. No focal consolidation or superimposed edema is
identified. There
is minimal tortuosity of the thoracic aorta with calcified
plaque identified
at the arch. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits for
size. No
effusion or pneumothorax is seen. The bones are diffusely
osteopenic with a
slight exaggerated kyphosis noted in the lower thoracic spine.
Underlying
lung hyperexpansion is suggestive of emphysema. There are
deformities of
numerous upper right ribs likely indicating remote trauma.

IMPRESSION: Underlying emphysema. No superimposed acute
pulmonary process.

TTE
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Mild aortic regurgitation. Dilated ascending aorta.


Brief Hospital Course:
69M with history of COPD, CAD s/p CABG who presents with dyspnea
likely COPD exacerbation, initially in MICU for BIPAP then
quickly weaned to home 3L O2.
.
#. Dyspnea: Exam and course most consistent with COPD
exacerbation, was initially in MICU for BIPAP, but weaned off
within approx 24 hrs to his home 3L O2 after initiation of nebs,
IV steroids, azithromycin. Patient has 90+ pack year smoking
history, and has not been taking anything more than albuterol at
home (pt likely not med compliant due to cost). Given history of
CAD and LE edema initially was concerning for CHF, but no
history of orthopnea or PND and TTE showed nl global systolic
function, EF>55% although it was a study limited by image
quality. No pneumonia seen on CXR, no leukocytosis. PE lower on
the differential. On the floor we started the pt on prednisone
60 mg to be tapered by 10mg every 2 days. He was also sent home
to complete his course of azithromycin, and to take ipratropium,
salmeterol, fluticason, albuterol inhalers (all generics for
less cost). He will f/u with pulmonary as an outpatient.
.
# CAD s/p CABG: Pt never had CP. EKG unchanged from baseline.
CEs neg x3. Pt states he no longer takes any cardiac meds due to
cost. He was started on simvastatin and baby aspirin. We held
initiation of beta blocker given his severe COPD.
.
# HTN: pt has been hypertensive with diastolic BP around 100
recently. may be secondary to prednisone. pt not on any
anti-hypertensiv
