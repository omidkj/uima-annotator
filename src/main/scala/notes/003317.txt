Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13129**]
Chief Complaint:
left knee pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left total knee replacement/cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 6633**] is a 59 yo woman with PMH significant for asthma
(FEV1 39% predicted, FVC 44% predicted) s/p multiple intubations
after operations, presents after left total knee arthroplasty
for DJD with hypoxia and tachypnea.
.
Initial exam notable for marked prolonged expiratory phase,
limited air movt, and wheezing.  She received [**3-27**] albuterol
nebulizer and a racemic epi nebulizer in the PACU with some
improvement of her symptoms. She initially described chest
pressure and once her air movt improved described [**5-3**] SSCP
worse with cough and expiration. OF note, she received 1800 cc
in OR with minimal blood loss.
.
ABG s/p several nebulizer treatments was 7.3/60/108 with RR~25,
HR 70, BP 127/63 and FiO2 60-70% by face mask.  EKG notable for
sinus rhythm with significant artifact and no ischemic changes
compared to a prior two weeks old.  After several nebulizer
treatments, air movement improved and she was noted to have
crackles to the mid lung fields bilaterally.  She was given 40
IV lasix on arrival to the MICU.  She has no documented hx of
heart failure.  She does have CAD s/p PTCI in [**2165**] and held her
plavix preoperatively.
.
Of note, she had an almost identical episode after her last TKR
in [**2162**] during which she was re-intubated post-op and also had
SSCP which was evaluated with serial cardiac enzymes and
ultimately a dobutamine stress test.


Past Medical History:
1)Asthma/reactive airway disease for the past 15 years with a
history of at least five intubations, with at least two this
year
after minor operations on her right lower extremity.
2)status post-right knee arthroscopy in [**Month (only) 547**] of this year,
which
is complicated by respriatory failure and two days intubation in

the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] at [**Hospital3 **].
3) Status post-right toe bunionectomy, complicated by a
respiratory failure at [**Hospital 487**] Hospital earlier this year.
4) s/p cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital3 **] with a
question of coronary artery stenting at that time in
approximately [**Month (only) 205**] of this year.
5)anemia
6)hyperlipidemia
7)hepatic steatosis noted on imaging
8)hypertension, with a history of hypertensive urgency in [**Month (only) 547**]

of this year, an echo in [**Month (only) 547**] of this year showed an EF of 65%

and 1 to 2+ MR.
9) status post-hysterectomy.
10)Status post- appendectomy
11)Status post-perforated colon? cancer, requiring ostomy in the
past.


Social History:
per OMR: She lives in [**Hospital1 487**], alone. She is retired. She has a
30 pack year history of smoking, which she quit smoking five

did have an MI at age 60.

Imaging:
.
ECHO showed: mildly dilated L atrium, with normal left
ventricular wall thicknesses and size. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%). There is a mild resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction. RV wnl.  Study is
inadequate to exclude significant aortic valve stenosis.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease. The first
diagonal
contained a 60% lesion that appeared to be hazy on angiography.
The
right coronary, circumflex and left main were all free of
angiographically apparent flow limiting disease. The circumflex
arose
from a separate origin in the right coronary cusp.
2. The patient had a hazy first diagonal lesion. Her pain was
ongoing
and was made worse during balloon inflation. It was better after

stenting.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Successful BMS to diagonal lesion
2. Single vessel coronary artery disease
3. Normal systemic blood pressures.
.
CXR (ICU):FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-30**], there
is ill-defined opacification at the left base silhouetting the
hemidiaphragm and descending aorta. Although this could merely
reflect atelectasis, in the appropriate clinical setting, an
infectious process must be considered.
.
Right IJ catheter extends to the lower portion of the SVC. No
evidence of
vascular congestion.
.
CT Knee: Large left knee hemarthrosis. Additional focus of
hyperdensity
seen around the deep sutures may represent hematoma as well.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery service and
was taken to the operating room for total knee replacement.
Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The
surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the
procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics.

Postoperative course was remarkable for the following acute
hypoxic respiratory failure with a Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for acute
respiratory distress which was multifactorial: asthma
exacerbation and possible flash pulmonary edema.

[**Hospital Unit Name 13533**]:
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] given concern for increased work
of breathing after extubation in PACU. Initial exam was notable
for poor air movement and bilateral wheezing. Air movement
improved with multiple nebulizer treatments and lung exam then
revealed wheezing.  Patient was treated with Albuterol and
Ipratropium nebs in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and was weaned to NC.  She was also
given IV Lasix for concern for volume overload contributing to
her symptoms.  Her respiratory distress was thought to be most
likely due to bronchospasm from ETT, given hx of asthma and
repeated history of respiratory distress after similar episodes.
 However, she was also given a short steroid taper for potential
asthma exacerbation.
.
Interestingly, the patient had elevated lactate in
post-operative setting, attributed to albuterol.  This trended
down without intervention.
.
Of note, the patient had chest pain on night of admission, as
well as two episodes the following day.  During all episodes,
she had normal EKG and serial cardiac enzymes were negative.
She was treated with sublingual nitro without response, but pa
