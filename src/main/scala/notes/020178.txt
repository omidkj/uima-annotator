History of Present Illness:
49 year old female with down syndrome/TOF admitted to [**Hospital 1562**]
Hospital on [**11-19**] for foot and abdominal pain.  On HD 2, patient
had decreased in hct and hematemesis (28-> 16%).  She was
intubated for airway protection and volume resuscitated with 8u
blood/ivf.  She had labile blood pressures and requiring

Radiology
[**11-23**] CT Abd: Abnormal appearance to the second portion of the
duodenum with extensive stranding and fluid surrounding it. Foci
of gas are seen in this region, which may be intraluminal,
however, a contained perforation cannot be excluded. A focus
free air is seen. There is a moderate amount of free fluid in
the abdomen and pelvis. Diffuse anasarca. Bilateral moderate
pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.

[**12-2**] CT Abd: Overall, there has not been any significant change
compared to the previous examination of [**2140-11-23**]. Bilateral
pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis as before. No
definite evidence for duodenal perforation. Slight improvement
in the anasarca.

[**12-2**] Transthoracic echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
free wall is  hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. Intrinsic right ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid
regurgitation. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**12-6**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation
jet is eccentric. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
with trivial mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Repaired Tetralogy of Fallot is present with overriding aorta,
VSD patch, free pulmonic regurgitation (increased pulmonic
velocities likely due to this rather than pulmonic stenosis
although pulmonic region not fully visualized).

[**12-5**] CXR: There is a new patchy density in the right upper lobe,
which would be consistent with pneumonia in the appropriate
clinical setting. Stable features of CHF are noted. Tip of the
right CVL remains in the SVC with no PTX.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 49 yo woman with Down's syndrome, Tetrology of
fallot who presented with life threatening GI bleed at OSH, for
which she was intubated and underwent 2 upper endoscopies with
sclerosing of a duodenal ulcer. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management; her hospital course was notable for
aspiration pneumonia and MRSA line infection.

# GI bleed secondary to duodenal ulcer which is s/p sclerosis x
2- required 16u prbc at osh. Given possible duodenal
microperforation noted on initial abdominal CT, further
endoscopic procedures were not pursued given high risk of
complication. The surgery service was consulted, who did not
recommend surgical intervention as they felt, given her
cardiac/valvular disease, she was a poor surgical candidate. She
was treated concervatively with proton pump inhibitor, and
antibiotics (2 weeks of ciprofloxacin). Given she was H. pylori
antibody positive, she also completed a 14 day course of triple
treatment. At time of discharge, her hematocrit was stable. She
will follow-up with gastroenterology as an outpatient.

# MRSA line infection: The Patient will complete a 14 day course
of vancomycin. Transthoracic echocardiogram was without evidence
of endocarditis, and her blood cultures rapidly cleared on
antibiotics.

# Demand myocardial ischemia: In the setting of hypotension/GI
bleed, the patient was noted to have an elevated troponin T
(peak 0.25), which was felt to most likely represent demand
ischemia. Once she was hemodynamically stable, she was started
on a beta-blocker. Her LDL was 28 off a statin and, given recent
GI bleed, she was continued off an aspirin. A stress test may be
considered as an outpatient at the discretion of her primary
care physician.

# aspiration pneumonia: Given new right upper lobe infiltrate
noted on [**12-5**] CXR, the patient was treated with a 7 day course of
antibiotics. At time of discharge, she was stable on room air. A
speech and swallow consult was obtained, who recommended a
pureed/moist ground solid and thin liquid diet.

# Mechanical fall: The patient had 2 witnessed mechanical falls
(becoming tangled in blankets/IV lines) on [**12-7**] and [**12-8**]. There
was no apparant trauma/LOC. A PT consult was obtained, who felt
the patient was safe to discharge home with home physical
therapy.
