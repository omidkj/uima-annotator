History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 33323**] is a 70 yo woman w/hx of of Afib on
metop/dilt/coumadin and dCHF who presented to the ED with
diapheresis followed by a large bloody bowel movement while in
the ED. In AM on day of admission, she woke up with diapheresis
and felt SOB while taking a shower and exertion prompting her to
initially think that she was having CHF exacerbation. She went
to ED for eval and was placed in observation. At about 10:30am,
she had a bowel movement with frank blood mixed with black blood
insetting of an INR of 4.3. She denies nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, and abominal pain; she reports never having a bloody
bowel movement prior to this. She had a previous colonscopy
during which a benign polyp was removed but had never been
diagnosed w/ulcers.
.
In the ED, her vitals were T 96.3, HR 82, BP 112/73, RR 16,
saturation 97% RA and was in atrial fibrillation. She recieved
aspirin, vitamin K 5mg iv, vitamin K 5mg po, and a pantoprazole
gtt was initiated. GI was consulted. She was hemodynamically
stable in the ED and did not receive intravenous fluids. An NG
lavage returned 200cc of pink to red fluid with occassional
clots and received ~500cc of NS with the protonix drip in the
ED. She became mildly tachycardic in the early afternoon (hr
101) in the setting of bloody bowel movment (prior HR was in the
60s to 80s range). Pt was admitted to MICU for continued
monitoring at which point she was noted to have a ten point
hematocrit drop but remained asymptomatic w/out any new
complaints.
.
In MICU, pt had EGD which showed ulcers in the antrum; no blood
in the stomach or small bowel; erythema, congestion and
friability in the duodenal bulb compatible with duodenitis but
otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum. While these
were likely to have recently bled, it was felt unlikely that
these were the cause of such a dramatic HCT drop so colonoscopy
was persued. Pt received 4 units of pRBC and HCT improved to
32.7. Pt was felt to be stable and transferred to the floor for
further managment and to await colonscopy.
.
