Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5608**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status, respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
extubation
tracheostomy placement


History of Present Illness:
62 yo F PMH of afib, TIA, memory loss s/p hypoglycemic coma,
chronic low back pain, anemia, GERD, asthma recently admitted
with subarachnoid/intraparenchymal hemorrhage [**Date range (1) 107248**] and
readmitted to MICU with acute change in mental status [**Date range (1) 107250**]
being readmitted with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure.
.
She was just discharged yesterday [**3-2**] from MICU course for
altered mental status and hypercarbia. Her altered mental status
was likely
multifactorial to include medications (diazepam, percocet) and
hypercarbia [**12-18**] OSA and sleep hypoventilation. She returned to
baseline on discharge. Her hypercarbia was thought related to
her COPD and likely newly diagnosed sleep disordered breathing.
She underwent a sleep study and was discharged on BiPAP to
follow up in sleep clinic for a complete sleep study.
.
She was found somnolent this morning, was not placed on BiPaP
last night. Sent to [**Hospital1 **] for CO2 115. At [**Hospital1 **] placed on
BiPap with excellent response and transferred to [**Hospital1 **]. On the EMS
she was taken off BIPAP and placed on high flow oxygen. By
arrival she was altered with saturations in 70s. She was trialed
on CPAP with no success and bagged to try and take off CO2 with
no success and subsequently intubated and admitted to MICU. CTH
negative.


Past Medical History:
Left Temporal Intraparenchymal hemorrhage
COPD- no prior h/o tobacco use, + secondhand exposure
afib- was on coumadin for last few years
TIA- had prior episodes of flashes of light going across her
visual field, was placed on plavix.
Dementia- secondary to diabetic coma
Chronic Low Back Pain
Anemia
GERD

work as the press secretary to a state senator in the state
house. no [**Hospital1 **]/etoh or illicits.

Pertinent Results:
[**3-6**]: CTA CHEST:
IMPRESSION:
1. Probable pulmonary hypertension. No emboli in the main,
right, left, or
lobar pulmonary arteries, peripheral circulation is not
evaluated by this
study.
2. Right lower lobe collapse and heterogeneous opacification in
the right
upper lobe and lingula, more likely aspiration than pneumonia at
this stage, are sufficient to explain hypoxia.
3. Tracheomalacia. Upper tracheal mass or organized secretions
or aspirated material. Bronchoscopy recommended.
4. Probably pulmonary arterial hypertension.
.
[**3-6**]: ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen.

.
[**3-4**] HEAD CT IMPRESSION:
1. Expected evolution of left medial temporal parenchymal
hemorrhage without evidence of new hemorrhage or
intraventricular hemorrhage.
2. Air within the mandibular veins as well as the vertebral
veins is likely related to recent phlebotomy although clinical
correlation is advised.
3. Air-fluid levels within the sphenoid sinuses may represent
sinusitis in
the right clinical context.

Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo F PMH of afib, TIA, memory loss s/p hypoglycemic coma,
chronic low back pain, anemia, GERD, asthma recently admitted
with subarachnoid hemorrhage [**Date range (1) 107248**] readmitted with acute
change in mental status [**12-18**] acute on chronic hypercarbic
respiratory failure
.
# Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient was
felt to have a multifactorial etiologies for her respirtory
failure including central and obstructive apnea, a chronic
paralyzed R hemidiaphragm, and obesity hypoventilation which all
contibuted to her difficulty with respiration. She underwent
tracheostomy and had significant improvement in oxygenation and
acid base status. She remained mostly on AC vent settings with
daily pressure support trials which were sometimes limited by
hypercarbia. In addition, during pressure support trials she
occasionally desat in setting of decreasing TV to 280's. In
addition, she would benefit from diamox PRN to aid with
alkalosis while on vent.

She was also noted to be volume overloaded with a length of stay
net +7L. Her CXR was suggestive of pulmonary edema, and lasix
gtt was started on [**3-13**] with goal for 1-2L fluid removal. After
discharge, her lasix gtt should be adjusted to pulmonary exam.
.
# Tracheal tear: On [**3-5**], pt underwent a CTA to rule out PE
given tachycardia and hypoxia. CT revealed and abnl trachea. The
next day, patient was taken to OR for fiberoptic intubation and
rigid bronch which showed a 5cm tracheal tear. IP was involved
and recommended prolonged intubation to allow tear to heal as
well as ppx abx with Unasyn and fluconazole (both started on
[**3-8**]) for total 10 day course (last day [**3-17**]). After further
discussion with family and IP, it was felt that the most
cautious management for be for tracheostomy to bypass the area
of the tear given that she is at very high risk for repeated
intubation and the risk of causing perforation of the tear would
be greater in setting of re-intubation. She tolerated the
tracheostomy. She will need follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] in
[**2-19**] weeks. Trach can NOT be changed until after [**3-27**].
Sutures can be removed after [**3-20**].
.
# ? Mass in L hilum: Pt reportedly has a mass on OSH chest CT in
L hilum at location of bleed which was noticed by IP during
bronchoscopy. This will need to be assessed with contrast CT as
an outpatient. Please arrange with her PCP to have this
follow-up.
.
# Recent Left temporal hemorrhage: Unclear etiology, less likely
due to trauma, more likely [**12-18**] HTN and anticoagulation. No
evidence of rebleeding or new bleed on head CT. She will need
follow-up with neurosurgery (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **], [**Hospital1 18**]) within
one month post-discharge. At that time, he will re-evaluate
restarting coumadin and aspirin.  She was maintained on keppra
for seizure ppx in setting of bleed.
.
# Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation: HR remained mostly well
controlled int he 60's. Coumadin and aspirin were held given
recent hemorrhage.  She will need to discuss restarting
anticoagulation with neurosurgeon.
.
# HTN: Her BP was variable. Her regimen was adjusted to include
enalapril 30 mg daily and hydralazine 25 mg PO QID. Her
metoprolol was intermittently held given bradycardia, but it was
felt that she does need nodal blockade for her paroxsysmal afib.
.
# Altered mental status: Improved steadily over hospital
