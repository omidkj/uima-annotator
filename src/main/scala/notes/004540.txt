Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Infected ICD pocket

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Extraction of infected ICD with one lead unable to extract
Temporary pacer wire placed
PICC placed


History of Present Illness:
This is a 76 yo M w pmh CAD s/p CABG in [**2158**], Heart failure (EF
15-20%), VT s/p ICD, afib, who was found to have an infected ICD
pocket. He initially presented to an OSH with c/o a reddened
erythematous area surround the insertion site of the ICD. The AV
pacer leads were placed 4 years ago and his CS and ICD leads are
one year old (placed in [**8-12**]). He was afebrile on presentation.
He was started on ceftrioxone and vancomycin and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for device extraction. His pacer pocket was
noted to be clearly infected. On [**2184-4-22**] the patient went to the
OR for ICD removal. In the OR the right ICD leads and the CS
leads were removed. The left ICD lead was not fully extracted
(lead broked, the end was capped). A temporary pacemaker (VVI)
was placed via L subclavian access.
.
In the CSRU the patient remained intubated and a warming blanket
was placed due to T of [**Age over 90 **]F. He became hypotensive with SBP in
the 50's. Levophed was started. However, his BP quickly
recovered when the Propofol was decreased. He was also started
on Zosyn for broader coverage.

[**2184-4-23**] ECHO (post lead extraction):
A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA.
Dynamic interatrial septum.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Dilated LV cavity. Severely depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. No
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
[**2184-4-20**] CXR:
External pacing device overlies the right anterior chest. Three
leads arise from this pacer, one coursing to the right atrium, a
second to the right ventricle, and a third with an unusual
posterior course, presumably for the purpose of biventricular
pacing. Additionally, there is a single lead coursing via the
left subclavian vein with tip terminating in the right
ventricle. There is no evidence of lead fracture or disruption.
The heart is moderately enlarged, but there is no evidence of
congestive heart failure. No pleural effusions are present.
Relatively symmetrical biapical thickening is incidentally
noted. There has been previous median sternotomy.



Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 76 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, EF of [**4-15**]%, VT s/p ICD,
afib. found to have an infected ICD pocket. His device was
extracted and a temporary pacer placed. Pt was briefly intubated
and sedated and transferred to CCU for procedure. Patient was
transiently hypotensive after the procedure requiring briefly
Levophed and Neo. His BP meds were held. He was also orthostatic
and received 1L IVF with improvement of his BP. His Hct dropped
down to 26 the next day and he received 2U of pRBC with Lasix in
between. He was transferred back to the floor and stabalized.
.
# Infected device pocket: s/p removal of RA, RV, CS from right
side on [**2184-4-22**].  Attempted extraction of chronic lead -
unsuccessful with laser.  Lead broke, capped, left in pocket.
Temporary screw-in lead PM FROM LEFT SUBCLAVIAN VEIN placed.
Plan for abx IV 4 weeks (start [**4-23**]) and then 2 weeks after the
permanent pacer placed.  Device and wound swab with coag neg
staph, oxacillin sensitive. Numerous blood culture from
[**Hospital1 **] [**4-19**] and here at [**Hospital1 18**] have remained negative.
Patient will need to call to have pacer placement scheduled per
d/c paperwork.  Amiodarone restarted on discharge.
.
# A.fib- pt. with history of a.fib on digoxin and lopressor at
home and chronically anticoagulated.  Coumadin was d/c'd prior
to procedure to remove device. Lopressor held to better evaluate
HR per EP (and PR prolonged when hypotensive).  Plan is to not
restart coumadin, especially since patient maintaining sinus
rhythm and upcoming procedures.  Restarted lopressor at home
dose.
.
# Bleeding at op-site: In the CSRU, the pacer pocket continued
to ooze. Pts. INR was 1.5. This was resolved spontaenously w/
presure. NO significant recurrent issues, aspirin restarted
prior to discharge.
.
# Hypotension: After the OR pt was hypotensive to the 50's (SBP)
on neosynephrine, levophed was started. However, with weaning of
propofol his pressure rebounded. Levophed and neo were quickly
weaned off. Hypotension was likely [**1-9**] to sedation, resolved.
.
# Cardiac - S/p CABG. Initial held aspirin in setting of ICD
pocket bleed, but restarted prior to d/c without complications.
Restarted ACE I (held d/t Cr), lopressor, and imdur. Patient was
on lasix on admission, but due to renal insufficiency, held
restarting this - will need to monitor and consider restarting
at outpatient dose of 20 PO QD.

# HTN: Held BB, ACE I, imdur intially, all restarted on
discharge.
.
# CRI:  Cr 1.4, unknown baseline.  Restarted ACE I but held
lasix with plan for extended care/rehab to monitor and restart
as needed.
.
# hypothyroidism: continued synthroid at home dose
.
# depression: continue sertraline 100mg qday
.
