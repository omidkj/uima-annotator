Allergies:
[**Doctor First Name **]

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia at [**Hospital1 1501**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 85 y/o F with PMHx significant for HTN, TIA,
dementia, hypothyroidism, h/o PE, who was brought to the
emergency department from her [**Hospital1 1501**] for hypoxia to the 80's on
room air. On arrival to the ED, the patient's VS were T 95.6, BP
92/64, HR 56, RR 36. Her initial presentation in the ED was
notable to significant difficulty in obtaining an O2 sat and
somnolence with response only to sternal rub. CXR showed white
out of the lung fields on the right. She was initially tried on
BiPAP but was ultimately intubated. She was started on levoquin.
At that point, the patient was noted to have bradycardia
followed by asystole. She received 2 minutes of CPR, epi, and
atropine, with return of a pulse. A groin line was placed,
during which the patient had another arrest. During the second
arrest, she received NaHCO3 in addition to epi and atropine.
.
After the 2 arrests, the patient was hypotensive to the 40's to
50's. She was started on levophed but experienced significant
tachycardia. This improved with reduction of her levophed dose
and addition of dopamine. She was also quite difficult to
oxygenate, and her chest x-ray showed worsening opacification of
the right lung. Out of concern that this could be ARDS, her PEEP
was increased and her TV was decreased in an attempt to obtain
better oxygenation. Prior to transfer to the floor, the
patient's most recent ABG was 7.00/61/60/16/-17. She was on
Levophed at 0.3 mcg/kg and Dopamine at 5 mcg/kg. In addition,
while in the ED, the patient received 5 L IVF's, levofloxacin,
and ceftriaxone. VS prior to transfer were HR 104, BP 125/91.
.
On arrival to the ICU she was sedated and on the ventilator. The
patient's daughter reported that she spoke with her 2 days ago
and that, at that time, the patient was doing well. However, on
the day prior to presentation, the patient's daughter reported
that she sounded different/slightly confused on the phone.
Further history was unable to be obtained.

Social History:
Patient currently resides at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3504**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Nursing center
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 6014**]) in [**Location (un) 538**] after being hospitalized at
[**Hospital1 18**] for burns she sustained on her legs 2/[**2127**].  At that time
she was found to be living in sub-optimal conditions with her
daughter in a run-down house which was poorly insulated
therefore needing a lot of space heaters that led to pts burns.
Pt was also appointed a healthcare proxy, [**Name (NI) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 96422**]).

Family History:
Per daughter: Brother with [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer in his 60s or 70s.
Sister with breast cancer in her 70s. Another sister with
thyroid cancer, ?kidney/pancreas mass. Per OMR: Her mother
"dropped dead" in her 40s/50s in front of her (sudden death).
Her sister "dropped dead" at age 23 in front of her (sudden
death).  Her father died in his 50s of unknown cause, and had a
history of arthritis.  She has 11 siblings who have died, none
suddenly or from known cardiac causes.

Chest CT:
1. A 2-cm diameter irregularly marginated peripheral nodular
opacity in the right upper lobe. This could represent a
peripheral area of infection from either bacterial or fungal
etiology. Differential diagnosis includes primary pulmonary
neoplasm, pulmonary infarction, and contusion.
2. Large right and small left pleural effusions; large amount of
ascites and anasarca.
3. Multifocal ground-glass opacities in the lungs as well as
dependent areas of consolidation coexisting with atelectasis.
These findings are likely due to widespread pulmonary infection;
aspiration pneumonia should be considered.
4. New moderate pericardial effusion.
5. Indwelling endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube with slight

overdistention of endotracheal tube cuff.
6. Acute right anterior rib fractures without evidence of
pneumothorax.
These are likely due to recent CPR.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the ICU intubated and sedated s/p PEA
arrest and CPR x2. A CT scan was done which revealed a large
right sided pleural effusion and diffuse ground glass opacities
most consistent with infection.  An Echo revealed worsening
pulmonary artery hypertension.  Her INR was elevated to 10 on
admit.  She was hypoxic and required a large amount of PEEP.
She also was hyptensive and required vasopressors.  Over the
course of the day she became more hypotesnive and despite three
pressors and fluids.  Multiple discussions were held with the
daughter about the gravity of the situation and the lack of a
meaningful recovery.  After discussion with the attending it was
decided that CPR was not indicated.  She developed a
tachyarrythmia and then a brady arrythmia that appeared
junctional and eventually ventricular.  She lost her pulse and
expired at 18:30 on [**6-1**].  Family was present for the extubation.
 An autopsy was declined.
