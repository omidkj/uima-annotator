Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension and respiratory failure

R carotid endarterectomy (aborted)
Endotracheal intubation
Persantine MIBI
Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
63AAM with PMH significant for CAD s/p CABG [**2103**], T2DM, PVD,
presenting after becoming hypotensive in OR during CEA. Mr.
[**Known lastname 634**] had been experiencing two syncopal and several near
syncopal episodes over the last several months. He had a carotid
U/S done, which demonstrated tight R ICA stenosis of 80-99%. He
was scheduled for an elective CEA on the day of admission.
.
In the OR, Mr. [**Known lastname 634**] experienced hypotension to SBP 50s-60s
10-15 minutes after inducing anaesthesia, shortly after the
first incision. He was administered epinephrine, atropine, and
neosynephrine gtt. ABG at that time: 7.09/68/100, with lactate
8.0, glucose recorded as 22. Intraoperative TEE was done, which
demonstrated a markedly dilated RV cavity, severe RV free wall
HK, and abnormal septal motion/position c/w RV volume/pressure
overload. EF 30%. The procedure was aborted, and he was given a
bolus of IV heparin, and transferred to the CCU for further
management.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU, initial vent settings were AC
650/15/5/100% FIO2. PAC hemodynamics demonstrated PCWP 18-20,
Systolic PAP 80s. 7.40/32/94, MVO2 74%. Dopamine gtt was started
at 5mcg/kg/min to keep MAP>60, which was weaned off. Heparin gtt
was held pending CTA chest [**12-19**] significant oozing around R neck
incision site and site of L SC Cordis catheter. CTA chest
ordered to r/o PE, which appears to be negative. CT did
demonstrate ground glass opacities, patchy in places. Given
lasix 40mg IV x 1. Initial CK 174(6), trop 0.20.


Past Medical History:

Pertinent Results:
CTA Chest:
CTA CHEST:
No pulmonary embolus. The main pulmonary artery is enlarged
measuring 3.3 cm in caliber. Right and left pulmonary arteries
are at the upper limits of normal in size. A Swan-Ganz catheter
is in place with its tip in the right middle lobe pulmonary
artery. No contrast is within the aorta; therefore, its
evaluation is limited. There is no ascending or descending
aortic aneurysm. The right ventricle and right atrium are
enlarged. No shunting of contrast from the right to the left
heart. The patient is status post CABG.
CHEST CT WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:
Within the anterior segment of the right upper lobe, there is
extensive interstitial thickening peripherally and along the
bronchovascular bundles with bronchiectasis. This is mostly
within the inferior aspect of the anterior segment. There are
other scattered areas of peripheral interstitial thickening and
bronchiectasis including within the right lower lobe, minimally
medially within the right middle lobe, within the anterior
lingula, and within the anterior segment of the left upper lobe.
Some of these areas also have some honeycombing. These findings
are all consistent with chronic scarring. The etiology of this
predominantly interstitial lung disease is uncertain, and the
differential is large. It has slowly progressed since [**2115-4-5**]
chest x- ray. Superimposed on this, there is right lower lobe
atelectasis and some airspace disease that could represent mild
aspiration. The left lower lobe is completely collapsed.
Obstructing lesion is not evident on this study and unlikely.
The left lower lobe bronchus has a large amount of fluid within
it. Aspiration or pneumonia within this lobe cannot be excluded.
There are shotty mediastinal lymph nodes with a pretracheal node
measuring 1.1 cm in short axis. These are likely reactive. No
axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy. Within the upper abdomen,
there are no definite abnormalities. NG tube is in expected
position.
BONE WINDOWS: Changes from prior median sternotomy for CABG are
noted. There is multilevel thoracic disc degeneration. No
concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus. Enlarged main pulmonary artery and
right heart. This may be secondary to chronic lung disease.
2. Chronic interstitial lung disease with bronchiectasis and
honeycombing has progressed mildly since [**2115-4-5**] chest x-ray.
The pattern is not specific and differential considerations are
broad.
3. Completely collapsed left lower lobe. Pneumonia or aspiration
within this region cannot be excluded.
.
Intraoperative TEE:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is dilated. The
inferior vena cava is dilated (>2.5 cm). There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include mid and basal
inferior, inferoseptal walls. The right ventricular cavity is
markedly dilated. There is severe global right ventricular free
wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload.
There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the descending aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Impression:
Marked dilatation of RV with severe depression of RV systolic
function and accompanying moderate TR. No presurgery images are
available to compare. However, cardiac function reported to be a
dilated RV with mild depression of RV systolic function. Severe
global LV hypokinesis (overall LVEF 25-30%) with focalities in
inferior walls (basal and mid) Apex is not clearly seen and the
focal wall motion abnormalities may be missed.
.
Persantine MIBI:
INTERPRETATION: 63 yo man (h/o type II DM, CABS and ischemic
cardiomyopathy) was referred for a CAD evaluation following a
hypotensive event in the OR resulting in aborted CEA. The
patient was
administered 0.142 mg/kg/min of persantine over 4 minutes. No
chest,
back, neck or arm discomforts were reported during the
procedure. In the
presence of diffuse baseline abnls, the ECG is difficult to
interpret
for ischemia during the procedure. The rhythm was sinus with
frequent
multiformed VPDs noted during the procedure. The hemodynamic
response to
the persantine infusion was appropriate. Three min post-MIBI,
the
patient was administered 125 mg aminophylline IV.
IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms with an uninterpretable ECG.
Nuclear
report sent separately.
.
Nuclear Imaging:
The image quality is good.
Left ventricular cavity size is enlarged.
Resting and stress perfusion images reveal a severe fixed
inferior wall defect.
Gated images reveal severe global hypokinesis.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 18%.
IMPRESSION: Severe fixed inferior wall defect. Global
hypokinesis. EF 18%.
.
Cardiac Catheterization:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coroanry angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel CAD. The LMCA was moderately
calcified. The
LAD had
