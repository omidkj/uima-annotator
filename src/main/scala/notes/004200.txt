History of Present Illness:
68 yo [**First Name3 (LF) 595**] speaking female with h/o HTN, CAD, PVD, CHF (EF
25% and diastolic dysfunction), h/o breast cancer s/p tamoxifen

[**11-21**] ECHO:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with severe hypo/akinesis of the distal half of the septum,
anterior and inferior walls. The apex is also near akinetic, but
not aneurysmal. No left ventricular thrombus is seen. No left
ventricular aneurysm is seen. There is mild global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
extensive regional systolic dysfunction most c/w multivessel
CAD. Moderate-severe mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Mild aortic regurgitation.

[**11-20**] CTA:  There is no evidence of filling defect within the
pulmonary arteries to suggest pulmonary embolism. Moderate sized
bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis are
present. Nonspecific patchy
ground glass opacities are present bilaterally. The heart is
enlarged. There is no pericardial effusion. Soft tissue density
measuring approximately 2 cm is seen within the right axilla.
This may relate to a confluence of veins. The patient's central
venous catheter is also noted in this location. There is no
mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. Noncontrast images
demonstrate calcification within the aorta and coronary
arteries. Additionally, within the right lobe of the thyroid
gland, there is a low density lesion measuring 3.4 x 3.0 cm.
This could be further evaluated with thyroid ultrasound if
clinically indicated. An NG tube is present.

ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder,
right
adrenal gland are within normal limits. The left adrenal gland
and kidneys
are unchanged in appearance compared to the prior exam. There is
no
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.

A pigtail drainage catheter is noted in the right perihepatic
region, within a  small collection of heterogeneous density
fluid containing several bubbles of gas. Overall, this
collection has decreased markedly in size since the prior study.
Lower on the right side of the abdomen is a second collection,
around and adjacent to the second right-sided drain. This second
collection contains oral contrast material, indicating a
persistent connection with the bowel. This collection has also
decreased markedly in size since the prior study. Other fluid
collections in the left upper abdomen have also decreased in
size and do not appear to connect with the bowel.

PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: A calcified fibroid uterus is again noted.
The volume of fluid within the pelvis has diminished, such that
no fluid is evident on today's exam. There is no inguinal or
deep pelvic lymphadenopathy. Soft tissue defects about the
midline abdomen and several centimeters to the left of the
midline defect is again noted.

BONE WINDOWS: Multilevel degenerative changes are present within
the spine. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions are
seen.

Multiplanar reformatted images of the chest do not demonstrate
pulmonary
embolism. Multiplanar reformatted images of the abdomen and
pelvis redemonstrate two right-sided fluid collections, overall
markedly decreased in size in the interval.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Right thyroid nodule measuring 3.4 cm in greatest dimension.
If
clinically indicated, this could be further assessed with
ultrasound.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
4. Coronary artery calcifications.
5. Overall, substantial interval decrease in the volume of two
right-
