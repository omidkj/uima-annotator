Brief Hospital Course:
64F fall from standing (tripped over O2 tubing) w/C2 fracture, R
distal radius fx s/p reduction, R superior ramus pubic fx.

As a part of the initial trauma workup, the patient received the
following studies:

CT spine OSH: b/l min displ lat mass fx through transverse
foramen
R wrist XR [**1-20**]: impacted distal radial frx, with dorsal [**Doctor Last Name **]
CT head [**1-20**]: neg
pelvic XR [**1-20**]: ?R sup pubic ramus/parasymphyseal region, R inf
pubic ramus frx
T/L spine XR [**1-20**]: neg
MRA neck [**1-21**]: no stenosis/pseudoaneurysm

Neuro: No deficits.  Pt received pain control.  She was on high
doses of oxycodone per her home regimen at 80mg PO Q 12H.  She
also received oxycodone IR 5mg PO BID per her home regimen.  She
was also given trazodone 100 PO QHS to aid with sleep.  Pt's
pain was also initially controlled with PCA.  Pt received an MRA
of the neck which was not able to demonstrate dissection.
However, considering the patient was asymptomatic and that we
were not going to anticoagulate the patient based on the
patient's risk of bleeding, a new MRA was deferred.

CVS:  In the ICU, the patient was noted to be relatively
hypotensive with poor urinary output.  She received multiple
boluses for blood pressures in the high eighties and low
nineties.  The patient did not have any chest pain, but an EKG
was undertaken which did not show any ischemic change.  In
addition, the patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled.  Initial ce
were elevated to .11 and plateaued at this level.  No event was
thought to have occurred.   Pt received metoprolol and
propranolol and hydralazine for bp control while in house.

Respiratory:  IS was vigorously encouraged.   Pt with 02
saturations of 95% on 2L NC.  Pt s acute respiratory issues
during her stay.

Renal: Pt had foley in place.  Urinary output was initially low
in the icu, but renal function never deteriorated.  Creatinine
ranged from .7-1.0 throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay.

GI-Pt received pantoprazole for prophylaxis and diet was
advanced to full as tolerated.

Endo-Pt placed on RISS.

ID: No active issues.

ortho-Pt was evaluated for R radius fracture.  Fracture is
non-operative.
Pt with inferior and superior pubic ramus fractures which are
also non-operative.  Pt with weight bearing as tolerated.

ortho spine-Pt was evaluated by ortho spine.  Pt to remain in
hard collar and to follow up in two weeks with Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 6493**]
service.

Physical therapy:  Pt evaluated and found to need rehabilitation
services.
