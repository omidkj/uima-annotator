Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 20146**]
Chief Complaint:
Lethargy


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pigtail drain placement


History of Present Illness:
84 year old with h/o CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on hemodialysis
presenting with three days of increasing lethargy, fever,
decreased PO intake, and LLQ pain. Patient went to HD today and
since complained of severe abdominal and back pain and he
decided to come to the ED. He is a poor historian and states he
cannot describe this pain further but does state it was gradual
in onset started a couple of days prior to presentation. He
denies chest pain, sob, fevers, chills, N/V, change in bowels,
black, tarry, bloody stools, or dysuria.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 101.2 70 107/53 18 99% RA. He notably
became tachycardic to the 120s and question of atrial
fibrillation. Reportedly makes urine, however no urine on
straight cath. Labs notable for lactate of 3.9 that decreased to
1.7 after 3 liters IVFs. WBC 20.1 with 5% bands. Trop elevated
to 0.21 with flat CKs. CXR showed left peri-hilar opacity c/f
PNA. Patient became hypotensive to the 70s while in ED and a
triple lumen subclavian was placed and levophed started.
Currently at 0.09. He was given vancomycin and zosyn for
presumed PNA. Due to LLQ pain, a CT abdomen/pelvis was performed
and para-cholecystic inflammation can't rule out cholecystitis,
sigmoid diverticulitis. Transplant surgery was consulted and did
not feel any surgical intervention was needed. VS prior to
transfer: 76 8 97% 3L 130/65 on 0.09 mcs/kg/min of levophed.
Prior to transfer, small amount of hemoptysis was noted.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, patient feels well without abdominal
pain.

STUDIES:
CXR [**5-7**]: Markedly limited study due to positioning. There is
suggestion of a possible left perihilar opacity. Correlate
clinically. If indicated, consider repeat exam.
.
LINE PLACEMENT [**5-7**]:
1. New left central line ends at the level of the mid SVC. No
pneumothorax.
2. Left basal opacity, concerning for pneumonia.
.
CTAP [**5-7**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral small pleural effusions with basal consolidations,
concerning for pneumonia especially in the right lower lobe.
2. No drainable intra-abdominal abscess seen. Assessment of the
sigmoid colon is limited by extensive streak artifacts from the
prosthesis and lack of luminal contrast. If further imaging is
needed, a CT pelvis with rectal contrast may be helpful.
3. Distended gallbladder, and a small amount of pericholecystic
fluid. This could be secondary to n.p.o. status; however, if
there is clinical concern for acute cholecystitis, an ultrasound
can be obtained for further evaluation.
4. Extensive atherosclerotic disease of the aorta with narrowing
of the
origins of the SMA, celiac and renal arteries.
.
RUQ U/S [**5-8**]:
FINDINGS: The gallbladder is moderately distended, with a small
amount of
layering sludge and two tiny echogenic gallstones. Corresponding
to the
abnormality seen in the prior CT study, there is a focal
hypoechoic striated area along the anterior wall of the
gallbladder, which may represent focal wall thickening. There
was no [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign of the time of the study. The common bile
duct measures 4 mm and is normal. If there is concern for acute
cholecystitis, a HIDA scan or a repeat ultrasound can be
obtained for further evaluation.
.
[**2151-5-10**] Gallbladder scan: Normal filling of the gallbladder and
emptying into the small bowel after CCK administration.
.
[**2151-5-11**] TTE: No obvious vegetations seen. Normal global and
regional systolic function. Mild calcific aortic stenosis. Mild
mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
.
[**2151-5-11**] CXR: Incomplete left pleural drainage may be a function
of catheter placement anterior to posterior pleural collection,
loculated or not. Left pleural thickening may be restrictive,
responsible in part for continued left lower lobe atelectasis.
Severe worsening right lower lobe atelectasis.
.
[**2151-5-11**] CT Chest: 1. Moderate bilateral exudative pleural
effusions, layering on the right, partially loculated on the
left, despite a left pleural drain. 2. Severe bilateral lower
lobe atelectasis, without evidence of bronchial obstruction.
Degree of visceral pleural thickening is indeterminate
surrounding the largely collapsed left lower lobe, but not
appreciable along the left upper lobe or the parietal pleura in
the left chest. 3. Severe atherosclerotic plaque and mural
thrombu
