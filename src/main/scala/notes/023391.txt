Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1070**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status
.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.
.


History of Present Illness:
79 F with multiple myeloma on no therapy, dementia oriented x1
at baseline, DM2, CHF, CAD s/p CABG, CKD, indwelling foley w/
recurrent ESBL Klebsiella UTIs who was brought in by daughter
today from [**Name (NI) 1188**] house for concern of altered mental status.
At baseline she is AxOx1 ( reportedly recognizes her children)
but had acute change today. More lethargic. Less interactive.
Pts daughter notes, has had a cough productive of clear sputum.
She denies any recent fevers or diarrhea. She did have 2
episodes vomiting this week at nursing home. She has a chronic
indwelling foley. No meds given today per daughter's request. At
time of transfer from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2299**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], T 97.5, BP 111/70, HR 100,
RR 16.
.
In the ED, T 97.8, HR 57, BP 93/57-> recheck 116/68, RR 24, O2
97% 3LNC. She opened her eyes to voice but minimally followed
commands. Received 1L IVF for presumed sepsis w/ HRs from
110s->80s. Lactate 4.1->4.9->4.3 although SBPs never below 100
after initial [**Location (un) 1131**]. ECG w/ AF and new TWI inferiorly.
Troponin 0.1 but CKs negative and has baseline troponin
elevation. Patient refused asa in ED. CXR showed mild CHF. BNP
33,800 but often that elevated in past and has been >70,000.
Only 1 level on record <30,000. U/A c/w possible UTI and given
vanco, ceftriaxone, and flagyl. WBC 7800 but typically <5000 and
left shifted. Hct was at patient's baseline. Daughter refused
guaiac in ED. Also treated for K of 5.4 w/ CaGluc, insulin, D50.
Given elevated lactate, sepsis protocol pursued and RIJ CVL
placed. Significant bleeding around line post-placement-> direct
pressure, gelfoam, vit K 10 mg sc, 2 units FFP. Adequate
placement confirmed with CXR. CVPs 18-20. Prior to transfer to
ICU, patient received head CT.
.
Last admitted [**Date range (1) 94782**] for concern for potential
hematemesis which was thought to be most likely epistaxis.
Patient has a significant history of bleeding and epistaxis.
Hospital course was complicated by CHF, volume overload, and
CKD. She was diuresed and her creatinine remained elevated but
at her baseline.
.
Upon arrival to the unit, patient is lethargic. Grones w/
positioning but not responsive to voice. Not following commands.
.

Studies:
[**12-15**] CXR: Again noted is marked central pulmonary vascular
congestion slightly diminished from the prior exam. Mild
interstitial edema is again evident with interlobular septal
thickening and cephalization of flow. No definite consolidation
is evident. Slight improvement in the aeration of the left lower
lobe is noted. No definite pleural effusion is seen. There is no
pneumothorax. Evidence of prior CABG is again noted. There is
cardiomegaly with left atrial prominence. The bones are
diffusely osteopenic.
IMPRESSION: Slight improvement in volume status with mild
residual interstitial edema likely from cardiogenic etiology
noted.
.
[**12-15**] CT Head: Age-appropriate atrophy with chronic microvascular
disease as noted previously. Lytic lesions in skull consistent
with known multiple myeloma. No interval change.
.
[**12-17**] TTE:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with infero-lateral
hypokinesis. EF 45%. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is mild global
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with minimal aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**1-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension (PASP = 37). The main pulmonary
artery is dilated.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2136-10-4**], no
major change (aortic valve area underestimated on prior study).
LVEF is similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course by problem:
.
# Altered mental status: She has dementia and at baseline her
mental status is alert and oriented to name. On the day of
admission, she was noted to be significantly more lethargic than
usual and not interactive. She has had multiple episodes of
altered mental status associated with infection in the past,
notably with urinary tract infections. Thus it was felt that her
altered mental status was most likely secondary to a UTI (see
below). Her mental status improved significantly after treatment
with antibiotics. By the day prior to discharge, she was back to
her baseline, per daughter.
.
# UTI: She has a history of recurrent resistant Klebsiella UTIs.
The E. coli
