History of Present Illness:
This is a 66 year old female who while doing yard work developed
chest pain. She sought care and ruled in for an
infrarction(nonST elevation) with troponinI of 2.9.  She was
transferred for catheterization, however, had recurrent pain.
Heparin was begun and she stabilized. Catheterization revealed
triple vessel disease. She was referrred for surgery.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Focal calcifications in aortic arch. Simple atheroma
in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post_Bypass:
Preserved biventricular systolic function.

Final Report
AP CHEST, 12:48 A.M., [**6-22**]
HISTORY: Chest tube pulled, evaluate for pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-21**]:
Following removal of endotracheal, nasogastric, midline drainage
and pleural tubes, there is more atelectasis at the lung bases,
cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly larger, there is very
pronounced gaseous distention of the stomach, and no
pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. A small region of
atelectasis at the left lung base reflects the previous
placement of the chest tube. [**Known firstname 1439**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was paged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 13393**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization,
which revealed triple vessel disease. She had intact LV function
by echocardiogram.  On [**6-21**] she went to the Operating Room where
bypass grafting.  Please see the OR report for details, in
summary she had coronary bypass grafting x5 with left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery;
reverse saphenous vein single graft from aorta to the first
diagonal coronary artery; reverse saphenous vein double
sequential graft from aorta to the first obtuse marginal and
second obtuse marginal coronary arteries; as well as reverse
saphenous vein graft from the aorta to the distal right coronary
artery. His bypass time was 97 minutes with a crossclamp of 81
minutes. He tolerated the operation well and was transferred
from the OR to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable condition. He
remained hemodynamically stable, woke neurologically intact, was
weaned from the ventilator and extubated. On POD1 he was
transferred from the cardiac surgery ICU to the stepdown floor
in stabl
