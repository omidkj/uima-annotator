History of Present Illness:
63 year old male with history of ESRD on hemodialysis, IDDM,
htn, hyperlipidemia, peripheral arterial disease and bilateral
carotid artery disease (apparently tight right carotid) who was
admitted to [**Location (un) **] on [**7-10**] with worsening dyspnea, chest
fullness, transferred here on [**7-14**], underwent cardiac cath
showing 3VD (no intervention) now with hypotension, neck
stiffness and ST elevations V1-2, positive cardiac enzymes and
hypoglycemia.
.
Patient drove himself to [**Hospital **] Hospital with shortness of
breath, found to have elevated BNP at 2465, Trop 0.09-0.10,
Ck/MB
negative. EKG with new changes: right bundle and septal infarct

pattern. Echo at [**Location (un) **] on [**2121-7-11**] showed EF of 30-35%. He was
transferred here for cardiac cath on [**7-14**] which showed 3VD, no
intervention, but ultimate plan was for CABG. Given his
bilateral carotid disease, it was felt that this should be
further worked up. Carotid u/s showed 60% on right and 40% on
left. Given his dyspnea, orthopnea, he underwent an extra
dialysis run on [**7-15**] to remove additional fluid (2L removed). He
had been dialyzed on [**7-14**].  Referred for CABG.

REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 25% to 30% (nl >=55%)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated LV cavity. Moderate-severe
regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Severe regional LV systolic
dysfunction.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
mid anterior -
hypo; anterior apex - hypo; lateral apex - hypo; apex - hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Simple atheroma in aortic
root. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in ascending aorta.
Focal
calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter.
Simple
atheroma in aortic arch. Focal calcifications in aortic arch.
Normal
descending aorta diameter. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic
aorta. Focal calcifications in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Bicuspid aortic valve. Moderately thickened aortic
valve
leaflets. No masses or vegetations on aortic valve. Mild AS
(AoVA 1.2-1.9cm2).
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Physiologic MR (within
normal limits).

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was
passed with assistance from the anesthesioology staff using a
laryngoscope.
The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the
procedure.

Conclusions:
PRE-CPB:
1. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is
moderate to severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
anterolateral
hypokinesis.. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction
with mild dilation of the LV cavity.. There is moderate
hypokinesis of the
remaining segments.
2. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
3. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There
are simple
atheroma in the aortic root. There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are focal
calcifications
in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending
thoracic aorta.
4. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic
mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
6. Large bilateral pleural effusions are seen.

POST-CPB: Pt is being AV pqaced and is on an infusion of Norepi,
Epi,
Milrinone
1. Biventricular function is slightly improved.
2. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
3. Other findings are unchanged.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2121-7-14**]
1.  Selective coronary angiography in this co-dominant
patient revealed severe native three vessel disease.  The short
LMCA had
diffuse plaquing.  The LAD was a twin system with the more
medial
anterior septum LAD having an ostial 80% and diffuse proximal
80%
disease.  The Ramus was heavily calcified with severe diffuse
disease in
branch vessels.  The LCX was heavily calcified with proximal
diffuse
disesease.  There was mid 50% before OM1 and 70% after OM1.  The
large
OM1 had proximal 50% disease and the distal AV groove LCX had
80%
disease.  The RCA was heavily calcified with proximal diffuse
70-80%
with moderate pressure dampening.  The mid RCA had 90% disease.
There
was no true PDA but multiple vessels seemed to run perpendicular
to the
inferior interventricular septum.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right and left filling
pressures with a preserved cardiac index.  There was no gradient
across
the mitral or aortic valve.  The systemic blood pressure was
normal and
there as no pulmonary hypertension.
3. LV gram deferred due to contrast load.  Echo at [*
