Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Nifedipine / amlodipine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 158**]
Chief Complaint:
ischemic bowel


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2176-10-23**]  Exploratory laparotomy, low anterior resection of
this resection of the colorectal anastomosis, end colostomy,
extensive lysis of adhesions.

[**2176-10-25**] Exploratory laparotomy, completion right colectomy,
takedown of the stoma and ileostomy.


History of Present Illness:
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission note:

69 yo F with HTN, T2DM, COPD on 2 L NC (baseline), h/o
infrarenal AAA s/p repair complicated by bowel ischemia with
multiple bowel surgeries most recently LOA/LAR/end colostomy
[**2176-10-23**] and re-exploration with right colectomy and end
ileostomy on [**2176-10-25**] transferred from the colorectal service
for hypertension up to SBP 200s and tachycardia to the
130s-150s.

Per surgery, patient tolerated the surgery without issue.  She
received a total of 2 pRBC and about 2L of cyrstalloids.
Patient has been getting metoprolol intermittently prior to her
surgery.  Per report, patient was found to be tachycardic up to
the 130s with SBP up to the low 200s.  Upon reviewing the [**Month (only) 16**],
patient was found to have recieved metoprolol 5 mg IV x [**4-11**],
hydralazing 10 mg IV x 2.  Patient has been on a dilaudid PCA
pump and denied pain.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia.  UOP has
been about 748 cc since midnight.  Patient has been on
vancomycin and zosyn empirically [**2176-10-23**].  Patient was
thought to be more confused, ? delirium, so neurology was
consulted.

Upon arriving to the MICU, patient reports feeling some
palpitation, SOB which is slightly worse than baseline.  She
feels foggy but not confused.

UA and cardiac biomarkers were pending at the time of transfer.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI

tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies cough or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure. Denies constipation,

Studies:
[**2176-10-26**] CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECON
1.  Pulmonary edema on a background of centrilobular emphysema.
Given normal heart size on the recent chest radiograph, this may
be noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Small-moderate bilateral
pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
2.  No pulmonary embolism.
3.  Moderate atherosclerotic calcifications of unknown
hemodynamic significance.
4. Cirrhosis and splenomegaly no completely imaged.

[**2176-10-26**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect or
major vascular territorial infarct.  Ventricles and sulci are
minimally prominent, compatible with global age-related volume
loss.  Basal cisterns are patent.  There is no shift of normally
midline structures.  A hypodense focus in the left thalamus is
from prior hemorrhage. Hypodense foci in the left subinsular
region and left frontal lobe are unchanged from [**2175-6-16**].  A
hypodense focus in the left centrum semiovale (2A:15) may
represent a tiny lacune, new from [**2175-6-16**]. Otherwise,
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.  No acute
osseous abnormality is identified.  The visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.

[**2176-10-26**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
Patchy opacity at the right lung base could reflect atelectasis,
although aspiration or pneumonia could also have this
appearance.  Followup imaging would be advised.  The left lung
is grossly clear.  No pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.
Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  A
tortuous calcified aorta consistent with atherosclerosis.  No
evidence of pulmonary edema.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing
below the diaphragm with  the tip within the stomach and the
side port near the gastroesophageal  junction.  Advancement
should be considered to minimize the risk of  aspiration.
