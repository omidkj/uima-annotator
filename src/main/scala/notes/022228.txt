PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  Alert and oriented times
three; lying in bed; unable to speak in complete sentences;
tachypneic; no acute distress.  HEENT:  Anicteric; pupils
equal, round, reactive to light; extraocular movements
intact; mucous membranes dry.  Neck:  Supple; no bruits; no
jugulovenous pressure appreciated.  Regular rate, normal S1,
S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Respirations:  Diffuse
crackles bilaterally; prolonged inspiratory and expiratory;
no wheezes appreciated.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended; positive bowel sounds times four; no

101, bicarbonate 30, BUN 28, creatinine 0.6, glucose 287,
anion gap 27.  CK is trended 2.93, spike of 52.3 and then
post cath 39.02.

Chest x-ray revealed patchy, diffuse bilateral infiltrates
consistent with possible adult respiratory distress syndrome
or viral process.  Due to hypercarbic respiratory failure
patient was intubated for airway protection and placed on AC.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular:  Pump post cath echo revealed an ejection
fraction of 35%.  Initially held off anticoagulation because
of decreasing platelets, negative antibody, and Heparin drip
was initiated on [**2106-10-16**].  At time of discharge patient
was using Lovenox 60 mg subq b.i.d. with bridge to Coumadin 5
mg p.o. q.d.  Goal INR of 2 to 3.  Patient informed to have
VNA fax results to primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **], for
target goal.

Patient will need follow-up echo in one month time to
reassess ejection fraction at that time.  Anticoagulation
might be discontinued.  Given his low ejection fraction,
Electrophysiology evaluation was obtained, performed a signal
average ECG revealing a short QRS duration of 109
milliseconds.  Felt that patient will need to follow up with
Cardiology and have a stress test with T wave alternans at
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1566**] for appointment.
2.  Rhythm:  Patient remained on telemetry throughout
hospital stay.  Normal sinus rhythm without aberrancy.

3.  Coronary artery disease:  Patient was weaned off nitro
after catheterization.  Completed 18 hours of Integrilin
therapy.  Started on Plavix, aspirin.  Beta blocker and ACE
were titrated as hemodynamically tolerated.  Cardiac enzymes
trended down and blood pressure was successfully managed.

4.  Pulmonary:  Due to increasing tachypnea and chest x-ray
concern for ARDS, patient was intubated for airway
protection.  Patient improved with progressive diuresis on
hospital day six.  Patient was extubated with good gas
exchange.  Aggressive pulmonary physical therapy was
initiated as well as Albuterol and Combivent.  At the time of
discharge patient was satting 97% on room air.  Given
prescriptions for rescue inhalers as well as VNA assistance
for chest PT as needed.

5.  Infectious Diseases:  Blood cultures and urine cultures
remained negative.  Negative for Legionella or RSV viral
strands and fungal strands.  Sputum was positive for
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  Respiratory
precautions were initiated.  Patient finished nine-day course
of Vancomycin 1 gram IV q. 12 and was discharged with Flagyl
500 mg p.o. q.d. and Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.d. times 14
days.  He was afebrile throughout hospital course with
leukocytosis trending down.

6.  Endocrine:  Patient initiated on insulin drip.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
consult was obtained.  Per recommendations glargine 12 units
q. h.s. with Humalog.  Sliding scale was initiated.  Blood
sugars remained in adequate control.  At time of discharge
the patient was scheduled with a follow-up appointment on
[**2106-11-4**] at [**Last Name (un) **] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9978**] as well as vision
screen at that time.  Patient informed to record blood sugars
and bring them to his follow-up appointment.

7.  Renal:  Creatinine at baseline is 0.6 throughout hospital
course.  Received Mucomyst post-procedure dye load without
creatinine bump.

8.  Psychiatric:  The patient initiated post intubation Luvox
50 mg titrated up to 100 mg p.o. q.d.  Discussed with
psychiatrist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2092**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 106671**], at [**Hospital1 2025**] to follow up at
discharge.
