History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 88783**] is an 86 yo M with a h/o CAD s/p CABG X 4 [**2111-4-8**],
T2DM, bladder ca s/p TURB in [**2100**], s/p CEA in [**2111-4-3**]
transfered from an OSH for hypoxic respiratory failure.
.
He had been at home from rehab for 1 week, after which he
developed abdominal distention with a high grade SBO. At
admission, he was noted to have malnourishment/weight loss.  He
was admitted to the ICU and placed on NG decompression. He was
thought to have a RLL infiltrate with cough, and treatment for
PNA was started.  He responded to NG decompression initially,
but then worsened. On [**6-1**], he had a partial small bowel
resection, lysis of adhesions, and re-anastomosis. After
extubation, his hypoxia worsened and he developed a productive
cough, which was thought to be due to CHF vs pneumonia.  His
mental status was also noted to worsen. He has been receiving
nebs and antibiotics, and he has been diuresed and improved with
suction.
.
His post operative course was complicated by atrial
fibrillation, treated with metoprolol and with a cardizem drip.
His course also significant for leukopenia/thrombocytopenia and
grossly bloody hematuria which has resolved.  He has also been
hyperglycemic with FS in the low 200s.  His BPs have been stable
by report.  By report, he had a TTE with a normal LVEF. His
creatinine was 0.9-1.1.  He was started on TPN since his POD#1.
Up to the time of this admission to the ICU, he has had no
return of bowel function.
.
For [**Last Name (un) 8692**] pneumonia, he was treated with Flagyl, Azithromycin,
continued from his preop Ceftriaxone.  He was seen by ID who
felt he had a low likelihood of PNA and suggested stopping
antibiotics.  Over the last 2-3 days prior to his transfer, his
oxygenation and tachypneia had worsened. On the day of transfer,
he was satting 100% on NRB, and was changed to 9L face tent.
His ABG was 7.46/51/138, and his CXR showed b/l fluffy
infiltrates. His vitals on the morning of transfer were: T 99.4,
HR 96, RR 20, 114/49. At that time he still had no return of
bowel function.
.
On arrival to the ICU floor, he was tachypneic with use of
accessory muscles and parodoxical abdominal breathing. He was
able to tell us his name, and confirmed that he would want to be
intubated and [**Last Name (un) **] pain or shortness of breath.

Imaging:
CXR [**6-6**] IMPRESSION: Bilateral patchy alveolar infiltrate. A
part of this at least is due to fluid overload, however, an
underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.

[**6-7**] CT chest s contrast IMPRESSION:
1. Mild widespread pulmonary edema could be cardiogenic or
noncardiogenic
accompanied by small layering nonhemorrhagic and pericardial
effusions. Mild soft tissue edema suggests total body volume or
salt overload.
2. Multifocal consolidation should be considered pneumonia until
proved
otherwise.

[**6-7**] ABD XRAY IMPRESSION: Dilated small bowel.

[**6-12**] CXR IMPRESSION: Improvement of pulmonary edema.

[**6-16**] CXR: widespread ground-glass opacification of both lungs,
left lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation improving. Small
pleural effusions have not changed over the past several days.
Right subclavian or PICC line ends close to the superior
cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax.

[**6-8**] TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with basal to mid inferior and inferoseptal
hypokinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: regional LV systolic dysfunction consistent with
CAD. No significant valvular abnormality. Moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-4-23**],
the function of the basal to mid inferior and inferolateral
walls is hypokinetic on the current study. The estimated
pulmonary artery pressure is more elevated.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 88783**] is a 86 yo M with CAD CABG X 4, T2DM, bladder ca
s/p TURB, s/p CEA [**2111-4-3**] transferred from OSH after admission
for SBO s/p exlap/SB resection reanastomosis ([**6-1**]) for hypoxic
respiratory failure.

# hypoxic respiratory failure: The differential diagnosis for
his respiratory failure included multifocal PNA, ARDS, and CHF.
He underwent bronchoscopy to obtain better cultures as previous
sputums had been insufficient.  Blood and urine cultures were
sent, and they were ultimately negative except for yeast in the
