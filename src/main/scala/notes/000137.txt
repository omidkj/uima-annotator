Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5119**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizures, aphasia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation/Mechanical Ventilation


History of Present Illness:
66 yo M with a remote hx of EEE resulting in a seizure disorder
and EtOH use, transferred to medicine from neurology for
management of hypoxic respiratory distress.

Patient was initially presented to an OSH on [**2-19**] for evaluation
of sudden onset aphasia that day, which was noted to occur in
the past after seizures. On arrival to [**Hospital3 **], he was
noted to be in status epilepticus with subtherapeutic dilantin
level, so he was intubated, loaded with dilantin, given IV
valium, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] neurology ICU service. He was
re-started on Keppra, Dilantin, and Klonopin. No further
episodes of status while in-house, although noted to have short
episodes of seizures in lower extremities that would subside
with Ativan.

Hospital course complicated by NSTEMI with troponins to 0.9.
Cardiology was consulted and thought NSTEMI due to demand
ischemia likely related to peri-intubation hypotension
(transiently required neo gtt in ICU). Patient on heparin from
[**Date range (1) 80701**] and continued on cardioprotective medication. Also
noted to have a PNA (fevers, leukocytosis, and RLL
consolidation), started on Vancomycin and Zosyn on [**2-19**] at OSH,
which have been continued to date.

Patient self-extubated on [**2-21**], requiring BiPAP. Resiratory
status stabilized, and patient was called out to neuro floor on
[**12-14**]. Called out to a negative pressure [****] ?TB
exposure (daughter's boyfriend died of TB). Was ?receiving
fluids when noted to be having difficulty with respiration.
Received 1 dose of solumedrol for wheezing on [**2-23**]. Med/[**Female First Name (un) 1634**]
consult called for management of respiratory issues on [**2-24**],
noted to be volume overloaded/with crackles on exam after
getting maitenence fluids o/n.

When evaluated by the primary team on the floor this afternoon,
patient's breathing continued to be quite tachypneic/using
accessory muscle to breathe despite being on 5 L O2 and 2 doses
of lasix 40 mg IV, ipratroprium nebs, with -1 L diuresis in one
hour. Repeat ABG shows increased hypoxia on same oxygen settings
and worsening A-a gradient (570=>583, normal 19). Patient also
appeared slightly more confused, pulling off oxygen mask
frequently during nebulizer treatment and insisting a 'cap' was
on the floor, although nothing was noted on the floor.
Therefore, MICU resident monitoring patient on the floor
recommended immediate ICU transfer.

IMAGING:
CXRs
~ [**2173-2-19**]: Diffuse interstitial opacities are most likely due to
pulmonary
edema. Repeat radiography following appropriate diuresis is
recommended to
assess for underlying infection.
~ [**2173-2-20**]: In comparison with the earlier study of this date,
the endotracheal tube has been removed. There is opacification
at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm. This most
likely represents atelectasis and pleural effusion, though the
possibility of supervening pneumonia cannot be definitely
excluded. Pulmonary vascularity is now essentially within normal
limits.
~ [**2173-2-23**]: Moderate cardiomegaly is exaggerated by lordotic
positioning, but has probably increased consistent with an
enlarging heart, and/or pericardial effusion. Azygos distention
indicates worsening elevated central venous pressure. There is
no pulmonary edema, but left lower lobe consolidation persists,
either atelectasis or pneumonia. Left subclavian line tip
projects over the junction of brachiocephalic veins. There is no
pneumothorax.
~ [**2173-2-24**]: Since earlier today, lung volumes remain low. Left
lower lobe consolidation, right basilar atelectasis, and small
bilateral pleural effusions slightly improved. Effusion in the
minor fissure is not present anymore.

ECHO:
~[**2173-2-20**]: Severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction
consistent with multivessel coronary artery disease or stress
cardiomyopathy.
~[**2173-2-25**]: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Summary: 66 yo M with seizure disorder after EEE
infection and former EtOH abuser who was transferred from an OSH
in status epilepticus. Intubated and admitted to the Neuro ICU
service. Hospital course complicated by an NSTEMI resulting in
depressed LV ejection fraction, ventilator associated pneumonia
treated with 8 day course of Vancomycin and Zosyn, and hypoxic
respiratory distress due to volume overload from depressed LV
ejection fraction. Patient was also ruled out for TB due to a
possible exposure within his family members. During this
hospital course, patient was transferred to the Neurology ICU to
the neurology floor to the medicine floor to the Medical ICU and
finally back to the medicine floor. He was discharged home with
physical therapy.

Hospital Course by Problem:

# Status Epilepticus: Patient initially presented to the Neuro
ICU intubated in status epilepticus, likely in setting of
subtherapeutic dilantin level. Mr. [**Known lastname 80702**] daughter reports that
he typically has seizures every 4-6 months and that these occur
in the context of low or high levels of dilantin. His level at
the OSH was subtherapeutic. Unlikely meningitis given lack of
nuchal rigidity. Unlikely alcohol withdrawal as patient reported
he had not had EtOH use recently and his toxicology screen was
negative for EtOH. His head CT f
