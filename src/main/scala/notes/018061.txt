EAST HOSPITAL MEDICINE ATTENDING ADMISSION NOTE

87 year-old man with prior GI bleeds from jejunal AVMs in past,
CAD and CHF with EF of 30% s/p ICD and PPM for complete heart
block who presents from OSH with GI bleed.

He was in his usual state of health on until this AM when he
awoke from sleep with acute shortness of breath and sharp chest
pain radiating across chest. Was pleuritic in nature. No fevers,
chills, or cough. Pt was unclear if this was "heart burn" or
cardiac related and tried omeprazole however did not have any
relief. Then tried sublingual nitroglycerin x 1 which relief
however pain then returned. Pt then tried omeprazole again
without relief and then called EMS for further assistance. EMS
gave patient nebulizer treatment which per patient provided good
relief.

At outside hospital ED, patient was noted to have a hct of 25
down. Patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation. Of note, per patient, he has had several GI bleeds
and has chronic anemia from GI loss requiring several blood
transfusions. Has long standing history dating back to 2 years
ago. Patient was last admitted at OSH from [**9-26**] to [**9-30**] during
which time an enteroscopy was completed revealing stable AVMs.
However he required 3 units of pRBCs. Per report, if patietn
were to bleed, "spiral enteroscopy" was to be completed.

Additionally, patient was also seen in ED on [**10-2**] for severe
right nare epistaxis. Nasal packing was completed by ENT and
patient was sent home. Since epistaxis, patient has had repeated
episodes of melena however per patient, he has black stools
regularly [**1-26**] iron supplementation. He denies any bright red
blood. No dizziness/LH.

At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were 97.3 60 114/61 22 91% 4L. Patient
initially had chest pain and SOB and was given 4mg of morphine.
Several attempts at PIVs failed requiring RIJ placement. Hct was
24 and patient was transfused 1 unit of pRBCs. GI was consulted
in ED. Trop was also elevated to 0.25 however there were no EKG
changes. Cards was also consulted who did not feel this required
any acute intervention. He had one episode of hypotension to 80s
while positioning during CVL placement which prompted ICU
admission. He remained hemodynamically stable in the ICU.

On floor, he appeared well and had no complaints. He did endorse
his usual congestion.

ENTEROSCOPY [**2129-10-7**]:
- Clotted blood on a background of dry oropharynx was noted. No
active bleeding
- Diffuse friability, erythema and nodularity of the mucosa with
contact bleeding were noted in the antrum and stomach body. Cold
forceps biopsies were performed for histology
- At least 20 small AVMs were noted extending from D1 to distal
Jejunum. Treated successfully with [**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery.
- Otherwise normal Enteroscopy to distal Jejunum

PATHOLOGY:
Stomach, antrum, biopsy [**2129-10-7**]:
1. Chronic inactive gastritis with intestinal metaplasia.
2. H. pylori immunostain is negative with adequate controls.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 year-old man with history of CAD, systolic HF (EF 30%), DM,
recurrent GI bleeds presenting with chest pain, SOB and drop in
HCT.  The patient was taken to enteroscopy and found to have
numerous AVMs.  Caudery was used to ablate the AVMs that were
seen.  HCT was monitored post-procedure and HCT was
downtrending, but very slowly.  It is very probable that the
patient has other AVMs that were not visualized and may still be
oozing blood.  He had no frank blood in stool.  His discharge
hematocrit was 29.7.  Patient was not short of breath and did
not have angina on the day of discharge.

PROBLEM LIST:
#. Gastrointestinal bleeding from AVMs. The patient received a
total of 4 units of PRBC transfusion (2 on [**10-6**] on [**10-8**],
and 1 on [**10-10**]).  He had push enteroscopy with electrocaudery of
AVMs on [**2129-10-7**].

#. Anemia secondary to blood loss s/p caudery of AVMs [**2129-10-7**].

#. Chest pain/SOB: with elevated troponin concerning for demand
ischemia v. ongoing new ischemia. EKG unrevealing in setting of
paced rhythm. Could be related new ischemic event versus
ischemia in setting of anema. Cards was consulted in ED who did
not feel he required acute intervention. CP did resolve after
blood transfusion. SOB improved after receiving Lasix.  Ranexa
continued to prevent anginal symptoms. Nebulizer meds were
effective in controlling cardiac wheeze.

#. CAD/CHF: EF 30% per report. S/P ICD/PPM placement for primary
prevention. On Ranexa for refractory angina.  Lisinopril not
given because of low blood pressure.

#. Epistaxis: Packed right nostril.  Packing removed after
several days.  Epistaxis did not recur.

#. Hypotension secondary to hypovolemia from hemorrhage.
Resolved after transfusion.  Lisinopril held throughout
hospitalization.

#. DM: No A1c on file.  Insulin sliding scale given while in
hospital.  Glipizide restarted at discharge.

# DVT prophylaxis: pneumoboots

# Code: DNR/DNI (confirmed)

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Recheck HCT within 5-7 days; transfuse as indicated
- Titrate glipizide dose
- Restart Lisinopril if BP can tolerate

this when his BP is lower)

Discharge Medications:
