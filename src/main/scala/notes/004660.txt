History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname 449**] [**Known lastname 31251**] is a 74 year old male who was transferred from
[**Hospital3 **] for concern of possible bowel ischemia.  Mr.
[**Known lastname 31251**] reports he presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2136-2-3**] with
bloodydiarrhea and abdominal pain and was admitted overnight and
discharged with antibiotics (flagyl).  He returned to their ER
[**2136-2-5**] with worsening abdominal pain and was admitted for
further work up and put on levofloxacin and flagyl.  He has
since had increasing abdominal pain which he describes as
intermittent and he describes it as gas pain that is sharp in
nature.  He received several abdominal CT's over the next 4 days
that showed progressively worsening edema and thickening of the
bowel wall
but without evidence of free air.  He also had leukocytosis to
18K with a left shift; stool cultures were negative as of time
of transfer.  He reports he had a colonoscopy about 2-3 years
ago and told everything was OK.  He denies having any sick
contacts or family history of GI illness.

Of note, Mr. [**Known lastname 31251**] recently had a CVA 6 weeks ago on [**2135-12-18**]
that presented with left facial droop which has resolved but has
persistent bladder incontinence.  He had originally been on
coumdin for history of afib and PE but was switched to pradaxa
since the CVA and begriming about 2-3 weeks ago he reports the
presence of hematuria for which he presented to his PCP but had
not had any interventions.  About 1 week ago he stared
experiencing bloody diarrhea as noted above, with accompanied
incontinence to stool for which he presented to [**Hospital3 **].

Past Medical History:
PMH: Afib, dilated cardiomyopathy - resolved, PE s/p cardiac
cath, glucose intolerance, hyperlipidemia, DJD, gout,
hypertension, CVA - [**12-23**] - now with urinary incontinence,
essential tremor

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] on [**2136-2-9**] for
possible mesenteric ischemia. At time of admission the patient
was made NPO, started on intravenous fluids for resuscitation,
pradaxa was discontinued, heparin gtt was started for
anticoagulation. On HD 2 gastroenterology was consulted. Stool
cultures, blood cultures and urine cultures were sent. A CMV
viral load and C. Diff PCR were sent as recommended by the
gastroenterologists. On HD 2 the patient was started on a trial
of clear liquids which he tolerated. A consult was placed to the
Infectous Disease department. On HD 3 multiple stool cultures
and tests were sent as recommended by ID. The patient had one
episode of rapid heart rate to the 150s. The patient responded
to 5mg IV lopressor. On HD4 the patient was switched to IV
digoxin and IV beta blocker for better rate control of his
atrial fibrillation. An RPR and ANCA were sent as per GI
recommendations. Medicine was consulted for work up for
patient's diarrhea and GI bleeding. Patient's care was
transferred to the medical service on HD 4 and subsequently to
the medical ICU.
.
The patient was transferred to the MICU for closer management of
Atrial fibrillation with RVR.
.
MICU Green Course
.
74 with Afib with rvr, dialated cardiomyopathy, HLD, HTN, s/p
PE, recent stroke who was initially transferred from the medical
floor to the MICU for management of Afib with RVR in the setting
of diarrhea, enteritiss, palpable purpura and petechiae
indicative of possible vasculitis. Subsequently developed
intermittent bowl obstruction which improved at times with NG
tube. Started on steroids [**2136-2-16**] for suspected GI vasculitis.
Decompensated on [**2136-2-19**] with hypoxemic respiratory failure and
septic shock requiring mechanical ventilation and pressors. He
was initially extubated successfully for 4 days before being
intubated again [**2136-2-25**], given recurrent tachypnea and
Hypotensive episode. He then developed 2 large volume upper GI
bleeds requiring 7 units of prbc and then a family meeting took
place. After the family meeting his health care proxy, his wife,
decided to  make the patient CMO  and he was extubated. The
patient passed away shortly thereafter.
.
#Hypoxemic Respiratory failure: Patient intubated twice during
the admission. Differential included aspiration pneumonitis and
mucous plugging, unlikely to be acute heart failure or pneumonia
given clear CXR. First extubation failed and the patient was
reintubated 4 days later due to persistent tachypnea.Continued
Abx coverage with Vancomycin and Zosyn for presumed HAP given
fevers/sputum cx grew MRSA.
.
#Hypotension- At times during the admission the patient became
hypotensive to SBP to the 70's. He did grow MRSA from 1 blood cx
which was treated with Vancomycin. He recieved multiple fluid
bolus's and at times was breifly on phenylephrine. His BP during
his admission was mostly stable above SBP>120 without any
support
..
# UGIB/SBO: KUB and RUQ consistent with SBO concerning ischemic
colitis or mesenteric ischemia.At time had high NG output,
including cofee ground, bilious output  In the differential is
vasculitis, mesenteric emboli from atrial fibrillation, and
atherosclerosis. Continued IV  pantoprazole to 80mg
[**Hospital1 **].Appreciated GI and Surgery recs. Lactate was never
significantly elevated
.

# Enteritis: clinically most likely to be same process as in
skin where biopsy shows Medium to small vessel vasculitis. Had
CT abdomen which revealed isolated jejunitis and ileitis.
Autoimmune serologies were negative and Rheumatology recommended
to start steroids for presumed vasculitis.Thought to be most
consistent  with LCV vs. HSP-like process. [**Doctor First Name **] and ANCA were
negative. The following tests were negative:  dsDNA, ENA ([**Doctor Last Name 1968**],
Ro, La, RNP), cryoglobulins, RF, RPR, SPEP, UPEP, lupus
anticoagulant, anticardiolipin Ab, and RMSF titers.
.
# Rash ?????? Leading diagnosis is vasculitis  as above largely based
on skin biopsy. Improved in last 24 hours of life, unclear what
led to improvement, but may have been due to high dose pulsed
steroids.
.
# Afib/RVR: Difficult to control. Worsened RVR with fever spikes
and episodes of hypotension related to the GI bleed. Very
difficult to control during admission with RVR to 140's. Was put
on Esmolol drip and diltiazam drip and continued Digoxin. Cards
recs were appreciated.

 # Renal Failure /Hematuria/Proteinuria: may be prerenal
azotemia but will have to balance with risk of pulmonary
edema.Combination of renal contrast and pre renal during
admission which recovered with fluids. In last 3 days of life
Creatinine was trending up in the setting of recent Hypotensive
episode and intubation. Renal recs were appreciated
.
# Elevated Lipase:In the differential was bowel obstruction as
etiology though more likely is pancreatitis, no nausea,
vomiting, some epigastric tenderness, could be pancreatitis
caused by medications, or potential autoimmune . Triglycerides
normal level. Lasix induced pancreatitis was in the
differential.
.
# elevated INR: likely secondary to poor nutritional
status.Reversed to 1.2 with vitamin K.
# Nutrition:Continued TPN.
#  Hyperglycemia: Insulin sliding scale continued.
.

# Thrush: resolved with nystatin
