History of Present Illness:
 Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 year old male with a PMH significant for stage
5 CKD of unknown etiology complicated by secondary
hyperparathyroidism and anemia who initiated dialysis on
[**2160-10-1**]. He also has a history of tobacco use resulting in
COPD now with a pulmonary nodule, HTN, CAD, HLD, hyperkalemia,
gout, CVA, and carotid endarterectomy.  Per daughter, patient
knocked on her door at 3am, saying he couldn't catch breath, she
gave him an albuterol neb which initially helped but then he
stated he couldn't breath  so they called EMS.  When EMS
arrived, his RR was 33 and SBP 170, felt he was in distress and
intubated in the field.  Daughter reports no new fever or cough,
no increasing albuterol use (though states he has been taking a
'pill' instead of using his neb machine for the last 4 weeks),
no missed dialysis, but patient with some increasing edema,
particularly L>R leg.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T:unknown P:70 BP: 170/60 R O2 sat
100% on ventilator.  On exam, lungs sounded wheezing, 1+ edema.
CXR showed RML pneumonia. Potassium high at 5.7. Sent blood and
urine cultures. Labs notable for creatinine of 5.1, HCT 32.7,
u/a negative, serum tox 1. Patient was given methylprednisone,
ceftriaxone and levofloxacin.  Is on propofol. No ABG done
downstairs.
.
On the floor, patient is intubated and sedated.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.
Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain,
or changes in bowel habits. Denies dysuria, frequency, or
urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rashes or skin
changes.

2. hypercholesterolemia
3. peptic ulcer disease
4. colocutaneous fistula status post low anterior resection,
colostomy, and a loop ileo-ostomy [**2154**]
5. history of pneumonia - 5 months ago in [**Country 3587**], spent 10
days in hospital
6. denies history of CAD or diabetes (however, metformin was on
med list in [**8-18**] in OMR)


Social History:
He lives with his daughter, he is retired from instructing at a
driving school.  He has a significant smoking history, but quit
in [**Month (only) 956**].  He does not drink alcohol or use drugs.
.


Family History:
Brother is on dialysis as a complication of DMII. Mother also
had diabetes.

Pertinent Results:
[**2160-10-16**] CT chest:
No filling defects are seen within the pulmonary arteries to
suggest pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary arteries are well seen
into the subsegmental level.  Pulmonary arteries are normal in
size. The aorta is normal in caliber throughout the thorax.
There is mild aortic atherosclerosis as well atherosclerosis at
the origin of the great vessels. Great vessels are widely
patent. Coronary artery shows extensive calcifications as well.
Heart size is within normal limits.
.
Compared to [**2160-9-24**], there is a new development of
moderate-large bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than
left. Pleural effusions are dependent and without evidence of
loculation. There is compressive atelectasis of the lower lobes
bilaterally, right greater than left and of the right middle
lobe as well. Collapsed lung parenchyma does enhance normally,
arguing against pneumonia, however, there are fluid-filled
airways in the right lower lobe which likely reflects retained
secretions. A component of aspiration cannot be completely
excluded here. There is no evidence for pulmonary edema within
the lung parenchyma. Scattered centrilobular emphysema is again
noted. Central airways are patent, with the endotracheal tube
tip a few centimeters above the carina in expected position.
.
Borderline enlarged right paratracheal lymph node is essentially
unchanged
from the prior study. AP lymph node and prevascular lymph nodes
as well as
upper right paratracheal lymph nodes have slightly increased in
size but do not meet pathologic size criteria. This is likely
reactive. Similarly,
borderline right hilar lymph node measuring nearly 1 cm in short
axis is
possibly slightly larger than the prior study, again, likely
reactive. A
subcarinal lymph node is also borderline and unchanged. There is
trace
pericardial fluid, slightly increased from prior.
.
NG tube has its tip within the stomach. Visualized portions
below the
diaphragm show no definite abnormality. Visualized portions of
the base of
the neck also show no definite abnormality.
.
BONE WINDOWS:
No suspicious lytic or sclerotic bone findings with multilevel
mild disc
degeneration in thoracic spine.
.
IMPRESSION:
1.No pulmonary embolism.
2.Marked increase in bilateral pleural effusions since [**2160-9-24**]
CT, with
moderate-large right pleural effusion and moderate left pleural
effusion
without complication to suggest infection.
3.Right lower lobe collapse, enhances normally. Therefore, has
an
appearance more of atelectasis than pneumonia, though there are
airway
secretions which could reflect aspiration. Otherwise, dependent
atelectasis.
No definite evidence of pulmonary edema.
4.Appropriate positioning of endotracheal tube and NG tube.

[**2160-10-16**]
BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DEEP VENOUS ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale,
color Doppler and pulsed Doppler imaging of the left and right
common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins
demonstrate normal venous flow, compressibility and
augmentation. No intraluminal thrombus is identified.
Compression and color Doppler imaging of the calf veins normal.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of right or left lower extremity DVT.
.
[**2160-10-17**]
U/S right arm.
IMPRESSION:
1. Negative study for DVT.
2. Grossly patent right upper extremity hemodialysis fistula. No
collections identified about the fistula.
.
9/4.10
CXR:
FINDINGS: The endotracheal tube and NG tube have been removed.
The heart is
mildly enlarged. There is bilateral lower lobe volume loss that
has worsenedcompared to the study from two days prior. Old rib
fractures are again seenin the left. There are small bilateral
pleural effusions left greater than right.
