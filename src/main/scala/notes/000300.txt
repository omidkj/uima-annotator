Admission Date: [**2190-12-10**]        Discharge Date: [**2190-12-17**]


Service: Orthoepdic Surgery


DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is deceased.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 16343**] is a 96-year old
female patient who presented from her rehab with an injury to
her left lower extremity. She had recently undergone an open
reduction and internal fixation for a hip fracture in [**2190-7-26**], and she was now at the rehab undergoing physical
therapy with good result. However, she was in the bathroom
trying to get up from the toilet and she fell sustaining a
fracture to her distal left femur. The patient denied any
dizziness, lightheadedness, blurry vision, headache,
diaphoresis, chest pain or palpitations. She was found to have
a complex distal femoral fracture and a hematocrit of 24 in
the emergency room.

She was admitted to the medical service for medical
assessment and preoperative workup towards surgical
management. She was consulted by the orthopaedic surgery
service, and she was transfused 2 units of packed red blood
cells and was given a stress dose of steroids for her hx of
adrenal insuffiency.
adrenal insufficiency.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Mrs. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 16343**] has a very complex past
medical history. She has a history of coronary artery
disease, and has had a myocardial infarction in [**2144**] and
[**2185**]. She also has significant aortic stenosis with an
ejection fraction of 55%. She has a pacemaker for sick sinus
syndrome. She has hypertension. She has atrial fibrillation
and has required cardioversion. She is diabetic. She has
sleep apnea. She has anemia, osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis,
gastroesophageal reflux, osteoporosis, primary pulmonary
hypertension and recently underwent a hip fracture.
She also has a hx of adrenal insufficency.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes a cholecystectomy, pacemaker
placement, hysterectomy, and open reduction and internal
fixation of her left hip fracture.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Include aspirin, atenolol,
Atacand, Prilosec, glyburide, Avandia, insulin, Lasix,
Zoloft, Neurontin, Vicodin, Colace, senna,
simethicone, Tylenol, Maalox, enemas, Tums, multivitamins.

ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to SULFONAMIDES, IODINE,
PROCAINAMIDE and AMIODARONE.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Initial orthopaedic physical
examination focused on her left lower extremity, which had a
closed fracture of the distal femur. Small ecchymosis noticed on
anterior thigh. She had a swollen thigh but  was soft with
significant
pitting edema. Her extremities appeared to be well perfused
and appeared to be sensory intact. She had no other
orthopaedic injuries. Assessment for additional physical exam
yielded a regular heart rate, a soft abdomen, a supple neck.
She was clear to auscultation bilaterally bu had reduced breath
sounds at the lower base. Her extremities showed 1+ radial
pulses bilaterally in upper extremities, and dorsalis pedis
pulses were noted by Doppler. She was alert and oriented.
Cranial nerves were grossly intact. Had decreased sensation
distally in her lower extremities
bilaterally but appeared to be sensate when assesed by light
touch.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medical
service, and a preoperative workup was performed including a
geriatric service  consultation who deemed her to be
at high risk for the OR given her moderate aortic stenosis.
Discussion with the family yielded a request for full code
and for addressing the fracture surgically in order to
facilitate mobilization. The patient was stabilized
overnight, transfused, rehydrated and was able to undergo
surgical repair of her femoral fracture with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 101**] plate on
the 17th. The surgical repair went uneventfully, and the
patient was taken to the post anesthesia care unit. However,
she had difficulty after extubation requiring her to be
reintubated. She also had difficulty sustaining her blood
pressure requiring pressors. She was admitted to the medical
ICU on the 18th. She required an additional transfusion. On
her first medical ICU day, she failed a second attempt at
weaning her off the ventilator. She was able to be extubated
on [**12-13**]. At that point, some  evidence of acute renal
failure was also resolving; and she improved to the point
where she was ready to be transferred back to the regular
floor for further nursing and postoperative care. She was
transferred to the floor on [**12-13**].

On the evening of [**2190-12-14**] a trigger event was
called because the patient was noted to be hypotensive with
a systolic pressure of 86. Initial floor management consisted
of normal saline infusion without improvement requiring [**Hospital **]
transfer to the intensive care unit at that time. The patient
went in the ICU where she was found to have persistent
hypotension. There was no evidence of septic or distributive
shock. Her hematocrit was 32. Her ABGs showed a pH of 7.26; a
lactate of 0.8; and she responded to a liter of
normal saline. The patient remained extubated and breathing
spontaneously.

By [**12-16**], the patient remained in the ICU. Her
hypotension had stabilized. She had evidence of poor
peripheral vasoconstriction. She remained extubated and
breathing spontaneously, but with some worsening shortness of
breath. This had responded initially to diuresis, but at this
point diuresis was held secondary to peripheral
vasoconstriction. The patient remained full code at this
point. Due to a rising creatinine, a renal consult was
obtained for management of renal failure. Diuresis was
recommended with an increase of the Lasix dosage.

The patient's respiratory status, however, decompensated on
the evening of [**2190-12-17**] requiring an urgent
intubation. She also became hypotensive and required using
pressors as well in the form of Levophed. On the early
morning of [**12-17**], the son was [**Name (NI) 653**] by the medical
service who expressed the patient's desires not to be
persistently intubated. The patient subsequently was made
comfort care measures only and expired on [**2190-12-17**].
