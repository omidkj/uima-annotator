History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19371**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, h/o aortic valve replacement

(St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]), PAD s/p bypass surgery and recurrent LE ulcers who
recently was admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] in [**2108-1-29**] following a
cardiac arrest at home. The patient was resuscitated within 5
minutes of arresting after being found to be pulseless and
apneic by the EMS team. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he was cooled per

protocol following his cardiac arrest. The patient developed
seizure activity in the setting of anoxic brain injury, and
neurologically was felt to have a very grim pronosis. Despite
this, the patient eventually underwent trach and peg as his
family wished to keep him full code and he was eventually weaned

off the ventilator. He was then discharged to a long term care
facility on XXX following a prolonged hospitalization with
minimal responsiveness at baseline. This evening the patient was

transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from his nursing home after being found to
be hypotensive to 86/44 and bradycardic to the 40's. There are
notes stating the patient had last recieved a dose of
carvediolol and lasix approx 12 hours prior to arrival in the
ED, and a CXR obtained on [**2108-4-30**] at [**Hospital3 **] showed
bilateral large pleural effusions and a possible LUL infiltrate.


.
In the ED, the patient's V/S were: Tm: 102 (rectal) HR 40, BP
90/40 RR 20 O2 100% on Vent. The patient's BP was noted to drop
down to 75/18 in ED.
He received: Vancomycin, Zosyn, 1mg Atropine, 60grams of
Kayexalate, 1 gram of Calcium gluconate, Insulin/D50, and 2.0L
of IVF. A central venous line was placed. HR improved to 60's
and SBP improved to 126/42 after receiving treatment for his
hyperkalemia.
.
ROS: Full ROS unable to obtain due to poor mental status. Per ED

staff, pt with hematuria in foley catheter
