Brief Hospital Course:
1. alcohol withdrawal -- Mr. [**Known lastname 4223**] required large amounts of
Valium (greater than 100 mg q24 hours) to control his withdrawal
symptoms.  He was briefly transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for concerns
about the quantity of his benzodiazepines and possibility of
sedation.  However, he did well and 5 days after admission a
taper was initiated 10% per day, discharging to inpatient
psychiatry on 10 mg po Valium q6hours with 5 mg po q3 hours prn,
to continue tapering as tolerated.

2. anxiety -- Mr. [**Known lastname 4223**] complained of severe anxiety
throughout his stay, initially attributed to his withdrawal, but
persisting after withdrawal symptoms resolved.  Psychiatry had
been contact[**Name (NI) **] in previous stays, and kindly offered their
advice again.  We initiated Buspar 5 mg po qday and 10 mg po
qhs, and increased his olanzipine dose to 7.5 mg po bid with prn
2.5 mg doses q8h.

3. delusional psychosis/impaired judgement -- Psychiatry
consulted regarding Mr. [**Known lastname **] anxiety as well as bizarre
behavior, attempts to leave AMA, and agitation.  His behavior
was felt to be potential for harm to self, and he had a Section
12 placed so he could not leave AMA.  He will be transferred to
an inpatient psychiatry facility on discharge for further
evaluation and management.

4. hypercalcemia -- Mr. [**Known lastname 4223**] was noted to have Calcium
levels as high as 11.0 during his stay.  A PTH was low, and PTH
related peptide and calcitriol/calcidiol levels were pending on
discharge.  Given his history of head/neck carcinoma, this is
concerning for hypercalcemia of malignancy.  This was explained
to the patient and he will need close follow up for malignancy
workup if his PTH-RP returns elevated, likely starting with a
neck CT scan.  Clinically, he has no physical exam evidence of
recurrence.

5. Hypertension -- remained stable on metoprolol and HCTZ.

6. alcoholic dilated cardiomyopathy -- stable, on metoprolol
[**Hospital1 **].  It should be considered to initiate an ace inhibitor in
his case, but the patient refused during this hospitalization
because of previous episodes of hypotension.
