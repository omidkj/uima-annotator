CHIEF COMPLAINT/IDENTIFICATION:  This is a 36-year-old male,
status post right cadaveric renal transplant, who was found
unresponsive at home and was admitted with acute renal
failure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Right cadaveric renal transplant in [**2163**] for hypoplastic
kidney.
2.  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in [**2174-2-24**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Cyclosporin 100 mg p.o. q.d.
Imuran 100 mg p.o. q.a.m.
Prednisone 10 mg p.o. q.d.
Isradipine 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
Zestril 10 mg p.o. h.s.
Furosemide 20 mg p.o. q.d.
Kayexalate 15 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  There were no known allergies.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was found
unresponsive at home by his mother.  [**Name (NI) **] was intubated by the
EMTs and was transferred to [**Hospital **] Hospital with hypotension
and oliguria.  He was started on dopamine, bicarbonate and
Lasix drip without any improvement.  CT scans of the head and
abdomen with contrast were negative.  The patient continued
to have poor urine output and was subsequently changed to
phenylephrine infusion.  His initial BUN and creatinine at
[**Hospital **] Hospital were 87 and 8.4.  His pH was 7.03 with a
bicarbonate of 16.  The patient had a known baseline BUN and
creatinine of 41 and 2.2 in [**2174-5-27**].

[**Hospital 12145**] HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to the
medical intensive care unit at [**Hospital1 188**].  His white blood cell count at that time was noted to
be 29,600 with 70% polymorphonuclear leukocytes and 6% bands.
 His hematocrit was 21.4 and he had a bicarbonate of 16 and a
potassium of 5.2.  He was also noted to have some diarrhea
with guaiac positive stools.  The patient was transfused with
two units of packed red blood cells.  There was some note of
some coffee grounds from his nasogastric tube, which cleared
with lavage.  The patient also had some elevated liver
function tests and CPKs.

On chest x-ray, the patient was noted to have right upper
lobe and right lower lobe opacities.  A repeat CT scan of his
abdomen was done following Quinton catheter insertion and an
unexplained hematocrit drop.  The CT scan was found to be
negative.

The patient was extubated on [**2174-4-7**] and was discontinued
from his vasopressors and Lasix.  He was treated with one
unit of fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K on [**2174-8-8**] for
coagulopathy of unknown etiology.  His chest x-ray showed
some improvement of his right sided opacities on that date.
The patient was subsequently restarted on his cyclosporin.
His prednisone was tapered from 50 mg to 10 mg.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  At the time of the [**Hospital 228**] transfer
to the medical floor, the patient was in no apparent distress
and he was afebrile.  His blood pressure was 130/60 with a
heart rate of 70, a respiratory rate of 20 and an oxygen
saturation of 98% on room air.  On neurological examination,
the patient was alert and oriented.  His cardiovascular
examination demonstrated normal heart sounds with no S3 or
S4.  He had a II/VI holosystolic murmur at the left sternal
border radiating to his left second intercostal space.  He
did not have any peripheral edema and his peripheral pulses
were palpable.  On respiratory examination, his chest was
clear to auscultation. The abdominal examination revealed
bowel sounds that were present and a soft, slightly distended
and nontender abdomen.

MEDICAL FLOOR HOSPITAL COURSE:  Sputum cultures and stool
cultures from [**2174-8-7**] and [**2174-8-8**] were negative.  On
[**2174-8-10**], the patient was transferred out of the medical
intensive care unit to the floor.  On [**2174-8-11**], his BUN and
creatinine remained unchanged despite receiving no dialysis.
A left Quinton catheter was inserted and dialysis was
initiated.  He subsequently underwent a PermCath placement by
the radiology department on [**2174-8-12**].

The patient was continued on a course of levofloxacin and
Flagyl empirically for a community acquired/aspiration
pneumonia.  His antibiotics were continued for a two week
course and were discontinued on the day of discharge.  On
[**2174-8-11**], the patient's cyclosporin was held and his
Protonix was decreased to 40 mg once a day.  An ultrasound of
his renal transplant was done and that showed that his
transplant to be without abnormality.  His cyclosporin level
was checked and it came back at 82.  A hemolysis screen was
done to rule out the possibility of thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura, given his low hematocrit and low
platelet count.  This screen was normal and a peripheral
smear demonstrated no schistocytes.

On [**2174-8-14**], the patient's diarrhea resolved completely and
he continued receiving dialysis.  His urine output was
improved.  On [**2174-8-16**], the patient was restarted on his
cyclosporin and stopped hemodialysis on [**2174-8-17**].  His urine
output continued to improve and his creatinine continued to
decrease without the dialysis.  He was noted to have an
increasing white blood cell count from 12,000 to 14,000 with
no focus.  His chest x-ray done at that time was clear and
cultures that were done were normal thus far.

On [**2174-8-18**], the patient had the right internal jugular
PermCath removed.  His hematocrit at that time was noted to
be 22 and he was transfused one unit of blood.  On [**2174-8-19**],
the patient's trough cyclosporin level was 33 and his
hematocrit increased approximately to 26 and his white blood
cell count decreased to 11.6.

CONDITION/DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged home on
[**2174-8-19**] in stable condition.  His cyclosporin dose was
increased from 75 to 100 mg once a day.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Cyclosporin 100 mg p.o. q.d.
Imuran 100 mg p.o. q.d.
Prednisone 10 mg p.o. q.d.
TUMS 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. with meals.
Nephrocaps one p.o. q.d.
Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.

Flagyl and levofloxacin were completed on the day of
discharge.  He had received a two week course of levofloxacin
and a ten day course of Flagyl.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient was instructed to follow up with his
primary nephrologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 28641**] at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital.
He had been instructed to follow up in the early portion of
next week.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Acute renal failure, likely secondary to acute tubular
necrosis from an episode of hypotension that was likely
precipitated by dehydration from diarrhea.
