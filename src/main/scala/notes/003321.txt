Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1271**]
Chief Complaint:
Intractable Seizures


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
placement of left hemisphere grid ([**2-23**]) and removeal of grid
([**2-26**])


History of Present Illness:
53yo RH woman s/p left partial frontal lobectomy and VNS
placement, with extensive history of seizure comes to [**Hospital1 18**] for
elective placement of grid for seizure focus localization.
Seizures started when patient was 13yo.  Observers noted that
the patient would stare blankly and then her head would slowly
slump to her chest.  These seizures last only a few moments and
then the patient would become aware and usually laugh as if
embarrassed by the event.  Patient also has partial complex
seizures, starting at age 13 where she loses tone and
consciousness, falling to the ground.  Had to wear a helmet in
later years for this. These tend to last less than a minute.  A
third type of seizure is noted in previous notes where the
patient has altered consciousness and shaking of the left arm
(family denies).  These three types of seizure are not preceded
by an aura, or any other sign that the patient recognizes (no
warning).  The family thinks that the patient may have been hit
in the head with a shovel when she was 6 years old by her
cousin. Also, Forceps were used on the patient when she was
born.  In [**2091**] the patient had a left partial frontal lobe
resection. However, seizures returned following the procedure
and have continued to this day.  Patient had a VNS placed in
[**2106**], which decreased the frequency of seizures.  Recently, the
frequency of seizures had increased coincident with the battery
failing on the VNS.  The battery was replaced; however the VNS
never provided the same level of seizure protection as prior to
the battery replacement.

Currently the patient experiences [**3-20**] seizures per day, with
and average of 8 seizures per day.  Approximately 2 of these
seizures are partial complex involving loss of tone and falling.
 The remaining seizures are of the blank stare type.  She has
never had a grand mal seizure or bit her tongue during a
seizure.  She has been incontinent as a result of the partial
complex seizures.
The patient??????s seizures occur with a fairly stable frequency.
The patient wanted grid placement for localization and an
eventual removal of the seizure focus.  The seizure focus has
been localized with SPECT scan to the left hippocampus, followed
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

At baseline, patient has always had memory difficulties, which
she attributes to the seizures; however she was able to
graduated from nursing school and work as a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1281**]
Hospital.  Her seizures eventually stopped her from working as a
nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2113-3-7**] and recently she has been living at the
[**Hospital 1456**] [**Hospital **] Rehab Center.  She has had to wear a helmet and use
a wheel chair due to frequent falls.  Some of these falls have
resulted in head trauma.


Past Medical History:
-Seizure disorder: The patient first developed epilepsy at the
age of 8 when she had staring spells. She then developed complex
partial seizures at the age of 13. She had been intermittently
treated with several anticonvulsants, none of which fully
controlled her seizures. She had a presurgical evaluation that
showed a left temporal lobe focus of her seizures over 20 years
ago. She underwent left temporal lobe resection in [**2091**] with
mild improvement of her symptoms for a short period of time
before her seizure activity returned to baseline. The patient
had a vagus nerve stimulator placed in [**2106**]. She has had an
increased in her seizure activity over the last year. Her
seizures appear now as drop attacks that come without warning.
She loses consciousness and is awakes anywhere from right away
to 45 seconds later. They are brought on by stress. She states
that she has had 4 seizures/day for the last year.  She was
recently admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] for medication adjustment, as
above.

Neurological examination:

Mental status: Somnolent but rousable to voice and pain.
Intermittently follows simple commands. Verbal output minimal,
attempted to speak a number of times was frustrated when unable
to find words.  At one point was able to form a phrase of words,
but did not make sense.  Unable to name.  Unable to use hands
well enough to assess writing.  Patient tends to turn head to
the left and will drift back to left after the head is
repositioned. Possible neglect of right side.

Cranial Nerves:

bilaterally.
III, IV, VI: Lateral eye movements appear intact.  Left eye was
slightly slower tracking and caused disconjugate movement.
However, stationary gaze was conjugate

VII: mild lower facial droop on right side, no involvement of
forehead

[**Doctor First Name 81**]: unable to assess
XII: Tongue midline, movements intact

Motor:
Normal bulk bilaterally. Tone normal. No observed myoclonus or
tremor.  Had difficulty following commands due to aphasia.  Was
essentially full strength on the left and had right leg
externally rotated.

HEAD CT: [**2-23**] postop;

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
53 year old woman with epilepsy s/p grid placement on the left.
Small amount of shift and subarachnoid blood.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please assess for progression of blood, shift.
INDICATION: Status post grid placed on the left, epilepsy,
