Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13256**]
Chief Complaint:
bloody emesis and BRBPR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD on [**2159-10-16**] and [**2159-10-20**]


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 59yo M with bright red bloody emesis and BRBPR.  The pt
is s/p variceal banding on [**10-5**] with 5 bands for an acute
variceal bleed with BRBPR and epigastric pain.  At that time the
pt was noted to have a hematocrit of 31.1, and he was observed
at [**Hospital3 **] until [**10-15**].  Subsequently the pt did well and
was advanced to PO solids, and he was planned to be discharged
today, but then had "black" diarrhea all day and was vomiting
"dark brown" material x1 around lunch, as well as diaphoresis
and right anterior abdominal wall tenderness, without radiation.
 The pt was re-evaluated by the MDs there and they determined
that the pt would be a poor candidate for a repeat EGD, and the
pt was transferred here to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation and
presumptively for a TIPS procedure.  At [**Hospital1 **] today the pt's
hematocrit continued to fall and he was transfused 4 units of
pRBC, and then transfered here.
.
On arrival to the MICU the pt was complaining of abdominal pain,
had an SBP of the 90's, HR 120's.  Story c/w outside records.

Imaging:
Echo [**2159-10-17**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2159-10-17**]: Abd US:
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited study. Findings consistent with hepatic cirrhosis
with patent
hepatic vasculature.
2. Small amount of ascites.
3. Splenomegaly.
4. No evidence of gallstones or cholecystitis.
.
[**2159-10-19**]: CXR: FINDINGS: There are mild bilateral lower lobe
opacities likely atelectasis. Minimal pulmonary vascular
congestion is seen. Widening of the mediastinum is attributed to
the tortuous course of thoracic aorta. The heart size is normal.
Pleural effusion if any is minimal on the right side. No
opacities concerning for pneumonia.

.
Esophagus: Protruding Lesions 5 cords of grade III-IV varices
were seen in the lower third of the esophagus. The varices were
not bleeding.
