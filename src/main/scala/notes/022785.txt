HOSPITAL COURSE:  It was decided that the patient would have
an aortic valve replacement.  This was performed [**2156-12-29**].  She had a aortic valve replacement with CE #19 valve
placed.  Postoperatively, she was on Levo and Epi, which were
appropriately weaned.  The patient remained sedated
postoperative one, two and three.  A neurology consult was
obtained and they recommended a head CT, which revealed
multiple infarcts.  The patient was also noted to be in a
decerebrate posture.  On [**1-4**], the patient was noted to
have acute right lower ischemia.  A vascular surgery consult
was obtained and it was decided to start the patient on
heparin.  A lactate level was obtained, which was 10.1.  A
general surgery consult was obtained to rule out mesenteric
ischemia.  They elected to treat the patient conservatively.
A repeat head CT at the request of neurology was obtained on
[**1-2**], which continued to show multiple infarcts.  The
patient continued to remain decerebrate posture.  On [**1-4**], the patient remained in a deep coma and neurology
declared the patient as an extremely poor prognosis.  A
lengthy conversation was obtained between Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] and the
patient's family.  It was decided at that time to make the
patient comfort measures only and DNR.  The patient expired
[**2157-1-4**] at 5:30 p.m.
