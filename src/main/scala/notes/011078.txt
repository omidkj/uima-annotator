History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 yo F with HTN, HLD, DMII, h/o R-sided CVA
with residual R sided weakness, CKD, and recent diagnosis of L
calf DVT on coumadin who was admitted to the neurology ICU
service on [**2166-6-2**] after being found down at home, and diagnosed
with a L basal ganglia bleed. She is being transferred to the
MICU for further treatment of her hypertension, acute on chronic
renal failure, and altered mental status. Please see her
neurology admission note for further details.
.
In brief, the patient was recently diagnosed with a L calf DVT
on [**2166-3-28**] and treated with 3 months of anticoagulation with
coumadin. She was last noted to be at her baseline MS at 8:15
am, but was found down at home beside her bed on [**6-2**] at 9:00
am, incontinent of stool, gurgling, and aphasic. EMS was called
and per report SBPs were noted to be in 210s. Patient was also
noted to not have taken her blood pressure medications for three
days, per her family. She was transferred to an OSH ([**Hospital3 **])
where her BPs were noted to be 160/90, but she was maintaining
her saturations. Her labs were notable for a WBC of 11.2, Cre of
3.1, CPK of 328, INR of 1.6. Head CT at OSH significant for a 2
cm L basal ganglia bleed. She was reversed with 10 mg IV vitamin
K, Factor 9, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. In
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was noted to be aphasic and per report had a
rapid decline in responsiveness. She underwent a fiber optic
intubation for airway protection, and oropharyngeal edema was
noted. Neurosurgery was consulted for her known L basal ganglia
bleed (11 x15 mm on [**Hospital1 **] admission head CT) , and recommended no
surgical intervention and no anti-epileptics. She was admitted
to the neuro ICU for further management and neuro checks. She
has had five head CTs that have confirmed stability of the L
basal ganglia bleed.
.
During her neuro [**Hospital **] hospital course has been complicated by
multiple issues including worsening failure to extubate, acute
on chronic renal failure, altered mental status, and
uncontrolled hypertension.
.
The patient was briefly extubated on [**6-4**], but noticed to become
less responisve and have increased work of breathing. Head CT on
[**6-4**] negative for worsening bleed. As a result, she was
re-intubated. Tracheal edema was once again noted, and she was
given a short course of dexamethasone. She was still unable to
be extubated [**2-25**] issues with secretions, and underwent a
trach/PEG on [**6-12**].
.
Regarding her renal failure, baseline Cre is ~2.0 (per renal
notes), was 3.1 on admission --> 6.2 over the past 11 days.
Renal was consulted, and likely etiology was thought to be ATN
[**2-25**] evidence of muddy brown casts on sediment. They have been
hesitant to do HD, but decided that a finite trial of HD (3
sessions) would be appropriate if her renal function continued
to worsen.
.
Her mental status was also noted to be altered [**Date range (1) 22743**], and
she was noted to be minimally responsive to commands despite
being off sedation. EEG showed no evidence of seizures, but
encephalopathy of unclear etiology (meds vs. toxic/metabolic)
and subcortical deep or midline dysfunction possible due to an
irritative process or a sign of increased ICP. On [**6-10**] she was
noted to have an E. coli UTI and on [**6-12**] was started on CFTX for
a 7 day course on [**6-12**]. Her mental status has markedly improved
since then, and she was noted to be opening her eyes and
squeezing moving her L hand to command. It was not thought that
her uremia was contributing to her altered mental status, per
renal.
.
Her hypertension has also been difficult to control, with the
patient on multiple blood pressure medications including
labetolol gtt and nicardipine gtts at different times. On
transfer, pt was on PO labetolol, nicardapine gtt, PO
hydralazine, IV lasix, clonidine patch, PO amlodipine, and IV
metoprolol prn.
.
On the SICU on evaluation by MICU resident, the patient had a
tracheostomy and PEG. She was non-verbal and unable to give a
ROS.
