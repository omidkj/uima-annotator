Admission Date:  [**2148-1-17**]       Discharge Date:  [**2148-1-21**]

Date of Birth:   [**2073-7-16**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old female
with known coronary artery disease and a positive exercise
treadmill test in [**2147-12-15**] who was transferred from
[**Hospital3 417**] Hospital for a catheterization.

The patient is a 74-year-old female with known CAD, status
post CABG in [**2134**], who reports progressive dyspnea on
exertion and leg weakness over the past year.  She originally
attributed her symptoms to being placed on Mevacor.  This was
changed to Lipitor but her symptoms have persisted.  She
reports lower extremity weakness and dyspnea on exertion when
climbing stairs or walking long distances.  She denied chest
pain, palpitations, or syncope.  She also reports feeling
more fatigued over the past several months requiring daily
naps.

In [**2147-12-15**], she had an exercise treadmill test which
revealed moderate reversibility in the anterior apical and
lateral walls.  A SPECT scan revealed septal hypokinesis and
an EF of 52%.  Risk factors include cholesterol, positive
family history.  She denied tobacco use, history of high
blood pressure, history of diabetes.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to penicillin and
tetracycline which give her a rash.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER FROM [**Hospital3 **] HOSPITAL:
1.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Synthroid 0.2 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Potassium 10 mEq p.o. t.i.d.
5.  Coumadin 5 mg q.o.d. alternating with 2.5 mg p.o. q.o.d.
6.  Heparin drip.
7.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
8.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypothyroidism.
2.  Allergic rhinitis.
3.  Hemorrhoids.
4.  DJD.
5.  Anemia.
6.  Cataracts.
7.  Alopecia.
8.  Coronary artery disease, status post CABG with LIMA to
LAD, SVG to D1, SVG Y graft to RCA and OM-1.  Catheterization
in [**2140**] showed an occluded SVG to D1.  A stress in [**2147-12-15**] showed moderate reversible defect in the anterior
apex and lateral walls with left ventricular dilation.
9.  Valvular heart disease, status post aortic valve
replacement and mitral valve replacement in [**2140**],
bioprosthetic valves.
10. Increased cholesterol.
11. Status post left carotid endarterectomy in [**2137**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  She was 95% on room air,
blood pressure 119/81, pulse 52, respirations 18.  She was
alert and oriented.  HEENT examination revealed that the
pupils were 3 mm bilaterally and briskly reactive.  The
oropharynx was pink and moist.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate
and rhythm.  S1, S2.  There was a III/VI systolic murmur
along the left sternal border.  Respiratory:  Clear to
auscultation anteriorly.  Abdomen:  Soft, positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  Palpable pulses, trace pedal edema.
Right groin site with dressing intact.  She had no bruit at
that time.

LABORATORY DATA/OTHER STUDIES FROM THE OUTSIDE HOSPITAL:  On
[**2148-1-15**], white count 10.2, hematocrit 39.4,
platelets 200,000.  Sodium 135, potassium 3.9, chloride 103,
bicarbonate 27, BUN 21, creatinine 0.8, glucose 74.  Lipid
profile:  Cholesterol 285, triglycerides 148, HDL 47, LDL
210.  LFTs:  Total bilirubin 0.4, AST 23, ALT 32, alkaline
phosphatase 90.

The EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm, PR interval 0.16, QRS
interval 0.12, left bundle branch block.

Catheterization revealed left main coronary artery 90%
proximal lesion, LAD 100% at the origin of the left
circumflex, 40% at the proximal RCA, no new occlusion
proximally, SVG Y graft to RCA and OM patent, LIMA to LAD
patent, two serial 90% stenoses in the aorta proximal to the
iliac bifurcation, 80% stenosis in the right iliac junction.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Essentially, this is a 74-year-old female
with a history of CAD, status post [**Hospital 8466**] transferred to [**Hospital1 **] on
[**2148-1-17**] with increased dyspnea on exertion, leg
weakness over the past year.  She had a stress in [**2148-1-14**] which showed reversible defect in the anterior apical
and lateral walls.  Her initial catheterization on [**2148-1-17**] revealed a 90% left main coronary artery lesion,
occlusion of the OM-1 limb, a known occluded SVG to D1, and
critical infrarenal aortic disease.

Her peripheral vascular disease prevented intervention to her
CAD at that time.  The patient returned to catheterization on
[**2148-1-18**] with successful stenting and PTCA of her
distal aorta, her right common iliac artery, and her left
common iliac artery with normal three vessel runoff to both
feet and widely patent common femoral arteries, external
iliac arteries, and internal iliac arteries, popliteal
arteries, and trifurcation bilaterally.

The patient returned to catheterization on [**2148-1-19**]
for a left main and SVG to OM-1 intervention.  During her
intervention to the SVG she suffered a brady systolic arrest.
She had chest compressions for five seconds with transient
15-30 seconds of hypotension with questionable seizure
activity and change in mental status with successful
resuscitation.

She was transferred to the CCU for further monitoring.
Neurology was consulted.  The questionable change in mental
status was thought secondary to hypotension versus postictal
state versus an acute bleed secondary to Integrelin.
However, follow-up head CT was negative and her mental status
improved and the initial mental status change was thought
secondary to syncope versus seizure.

The patient spiked a temperature to 102, thought secondary to
aspiration secondary to her decreased mental status.  Her
mental status is now improving.  Her temperature continues to
remain elevated.  She was transferred over the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service
while awaiting a catheterization on [**2148-1-22**] for
intervention to her left main coronary artery 90% lesion.

The patient's temperature continues to trend downward.  She
has only a slightly elevated white count at 11 which was
thought secondary to an acute stress response to her recent
asystolic arrest.

At this time, the patient is scheduled to go to
catheterization on the day after this dictation is done.
However, the patient currently is refusing the
catheterization given the pain that she had upon her prior
intervention.

The patient's discharge diagnoses and discharge medications
will be pending in the next dictation summary along with the
remainder of her hospital course.
