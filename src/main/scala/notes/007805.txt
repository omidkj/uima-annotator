Admission Date:  [**2161-2-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2161-2-27**]

Date of Birth:   [**2099-8-6**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old
male with coronary artery disease (status post coronary
artery bypass graft, status post myocardial infarction,
status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2153**]), end-stage
renal disease (on hemodialysis), type 2 diabetes mellitus,
and peripheral vascular disease who presented to Vascular
Surgery on [**1-29**] with bilateral gangrenous feet status
post bilateral iliac stents on [**2-7**] with a plan for
bilateral below-knee amputations.

The patient had intermittent ventricular tachycardia.
Electrophysiology Service was consulted, and the patient was
started on amiodarone.  The patient was planned for
catheterization on [**2-12**] before undergoing bilateral
below-knee amputation.  During the procedure for a stent to
the saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery,
the patient had an acute no reflow ST-elevation myocardial
infarction with an inferior and posterior myocardial
infarction.  The patient was treated with medical management.
Then, on [**2-15**], the patient had a hematocrit drop from
29 to 24.  A computed tomography scan showed a right groin
hematoma with questionable right hemothorax.  The patient was
subsequently transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.

During his Coronary Care Unit stay, he had repeated episodes
of ventricular tachycardia.  Electrophysiology decided he was
not a candidate for ablation or a pacer, and he was medically
treated with amiodarone and mexiletine.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
2.  Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial
infarction in [**2152**].
3.  Coronary artery bypass graft in [**2153**]; status post
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of saphenous
vein graft to right posterior descending artery in [**2159-8-19**].
4.  Congestive heart failure (with an ejection fraction of
30% to 35%) and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation,
moderate pulmonary hypertension, akinesis of the basal,
inferior, and lateral walls.
5.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  End-stage renal disease (on hemodialysis).
8.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
9.  Morbid obesity.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Status post left common femoral artery to posterior
tibial.
2.  Coronary artery bypass graft times six in [**2153**].
3.  Left iliac to posterior tibial artery.
4.  Status post angio with coronary angio ablation.

ALLERGIES:  ACE INHIBITOR (leads to nausea), NEURONTIN (leads
to shakes), question of a NONSTEROIDAL ANTIINFLAMMATORY DRUGS
allergy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
 1.  Tylenol.
 2.  Allopurinol 100 mg once per day.
 3.  Aspirin 325 mg once per day.
 4.  Calcium acetate 667 mg three times per day.
 5.  Plavix 75 mg once per day.

11.  Metoprolol 25 mg three times per day.
12.  Miconazole powder.
13.  Nephrocaps
14.  Pravastatin 20 mg once per day.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Echocardiogram showed
congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25% to
30%, severe 4+ mitral regurgitation, and 2+ tricuspid
regurgitation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 98,
his heart rate was 62, his blood pressure was 83/25, his
respiratory rate was 19, and 100% on 4 liters.  In general, a
morbidly obese male in no apparent distress.  Alert and
oriented times three.  Skin revealed bilateral gangrenous
toes in boots.  Cool distal extremities.  Signs of peripheral
vascular disease.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed the extraocular movements were intact.
The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  Heart
revealed a regular rate without murmurs.  The lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was obese,
soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There were good bowel
sounds.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Most recent
laboratories from [**2-27**] revealed his white blood cell
count was 7.8, his hematocrit was 30.8, and his platelets
were 119.  Sodium was 138, potassium was 4.5, chloride was
96, bicarbonate was 31, blood urea nitrogen was 32,
creatinine was 4.9, and blood glucose was 164.  Calcium was
8.8, phosphate was 3.9, and magnesium was 2.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  NONSUSTAINED VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA ISSUES:  The patient
was loaded with amiodarone and then placed on 400 amiodarone
orally three times per day which he was to continue for four
more days.  He will then be switched to amiodarone 400 mg
twice per day.  He was also started on mexiletine 150 mg
twice per day after lidocaine intravenous drip was found to
be successful for reducing the amount of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia.

The Electrophysiology Service felt that he was not a
candidate for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or an
ablation procedure and the he should be controlled medically
with amiodarone and mexiletine.

2.  PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was
scheduled to undergo bilateral below-knee amputations for dry
gangrene.  This has been rescheduled because of the inferior
myocardial infarction that the patient had.  He was to follow
up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1391**] (telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1393**]) by
calling to schedule an appointment for three weeks.  Prior to
this appointment, the patient was to call the Radiology
Department at [**Hospital1 69**] (telephone
number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 44714**]) to schedule an aortogram and lower
extremity arteriogram for evaluation prior to the bilateral
below-knee amputations.  This appointment for Radiology
should attempted to be scheduled for next week.

3.  INFERIOR MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION ISSUES:  The patient was
just to continue to be medically managed with aspirin and
Plavix for his stent that he has received, pravastatin 20 mg
twice per day.  The patient had been on metoprolol 25 mg
three times per day but was held and was not continued at
this time for chronically low blood pressures of 80 to 90 but
has hemodynamically stable and mentating fine during this
admission.  If his blood pressure starts to rise, we would
recommend restarting his metoprolol at that time.

4.  END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient continued to
have hemodialysis three times per week through his right
fistula.  He continued to take Nephrocaps and calcium
acetate.

5.  GOUT ISSUES:  The patient continued to take allopurinol
100 mg once per day with no major problems.

6.  ENDOCRINE ISSUES:  The patient had a great reduction in
his requirements for insulin while in the hospital because of
a change in his diet.  He was to be discharged on 15 units of
Glargine and a Humalog sliding-scale.  He normally had 60
units of Glargine at bedtime as an outpatient prior to this
and took 12 units of Humalog with each meal. However, with
the change in his diet he has needed less insulin.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient to be discharged to a nursing
facility.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was able to feed himself
but unable to walk or care for his activities of daily
living.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.
2.  Inferior myocardial infarction.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease.
5.  Dry gangrene.
