Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation via trach

History of Present Illness:
65M with severe COPD p/w tachypnea. He was at home and sneezed
and his trach cap flew off. He initially had difficulty finding
it and called [**Company 191**] who referred him to 911. When EMS arrived he
had found it but was tachypneic so they brought him to ED. He
has been short of breath lately but he denies feeling SOB except
when he is moving too fast, he says that doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] telling
[**Name5 (PTitle) **] to move slower. Got trach placed in [**Month (only) **]. EKG in ED was
sinus tach. Was tachypneic to 50 in ED so put on [**6-10**] and then
appeared comfortable. His trach was changed. VS prior to
transfer: 87, 109/59, 95% on [**6-10**] 35% FIO2. Was satting 87-88 Got
4L IVF for borderline high 80s pressures after being put on the
vent, he had a similar reaction after intubation in [**Month (only) **].
Got cefepime/vanc in addition to azithromycin and
methylprednisolon in the ED. Norepinephrine was about to be
started but his pressure came up and it was immediately stopped.


He denies any worsening cough, progressive SOB, fevers,
rhinorrhea, N/V/D, chest pain. He says that he has been
compliant with all of his medications including his advair,
tiotropium and albuterol.

Studies:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2162-4-8**] 8:09 AM
FINDINGS:
The lung volumes are normal. There is no pleural effusion,
pneumothorax, or focal consolidation. The hilar and mediastinal
silhouettes are unchanged. The heart is of normal size. The
pulmonary vasculature appears prominent. Left basal scarring and
atelectasis appears unchanged.

In comparison to [**2162-4-5**] exam, there is increased retrocardiac
opacity. The trachostomy tube terminates 8.5 cm above the
carina.

IMPRESSION:
Interval increase of the retrocardiac opacity, which may
represent atelectasis. However, superimposed infection cannot be
entirely excluded. Lateral views may aid in further evaluation,
if clinically indicated.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 yo M w/ severe COPD s/p trach p/w hypoxia and respiratory
distress.

1. Hypoxia: At presentation his sats were in the low 90s on home
O2 of 2L. In the ED his ABG did not suggest acute worsening of
hypoventilation. His worsening respiratory status was thought to
be secondary to a COPD exacerbation given his improved
oxygenation with pressure support initially. While on pressure
support he was hypotensive and was resuscitated with 4L of NS.
He was initially tachycardic and it resolved after resuscitation
and was normotensive prior to off of positive pressure. He had a
flu swab sent, which returned negative, with a culture sent from
the same sample. On chest x-ray, he had a retrocardiac opacity,
and in the setting of his hypoxia and tachypnea, he was started
on Levofloxacin and Ceftiaxone for pneumonia. When he arrived in
the ICU, he was on PS and pulling tidal volumes of 150. He was
switched to AC 450 with a PEEP of 10 and FiO2 of 30%. He was
started on solumedrol 60mg IV Q8H and written for Tamiflu which
was discontinued when his flu came back negative. He was also
given nebulizers and continued on inhaled steroids. Because of
his history of MRSA he was started on vanco, which was DC'd when
his cultures came back positive for Strep pneumoniae. He was
treated with levofloxacin for a 5 day course which he finished
and Ceftriaxone/Cefpodoxime for a 7 day course. His steroids
were tapered from Solumedrol to prednisone.  Calcium and vitamin
D were started on the day of discharge.
Follow-up:
- Finish Cefpodoxime 200mg PO BID until [**2162-4-14**]
- Steroid taper: Prednisone 40mg until [**4-17**], then 30mg until
[**4-22**], then 20mg until [**4-27**], then 10mg until [**5-2**].

2. Apnea: While here, the patient had apneic episodes while in
house which was thought to be central in nature. He will not
tolerate a CPAP mask at night, and would likely need to be
ventilated at night for these episodes.
Follow-up:
- Please perform a sleep study to assess for central sleep apnea
- Please arrange for home ventillation if necessary at night
based on the sleep study results for central apnea

3. Hypotension: Initially hypotensive and tachycardic. However
this resolved with fluids as above as well as removal of
positive airway pressure. He remained hemodynamically stable and
normotensive for the remainder of his stay.

4. ARF: His baseline creatinine appeared to be around 0.6-0.7
and was 1.0 on admission to the ICU. This was likely a pre-renal
azotemia secondary to dehydration. He was fluid resucitated with
4L NS as above.

5. Schizophrenia: Olanzapine was held initially for his
inability to tolerate being off the vent to take POs and was
added back to his regimen when he tolerated PO medications.

6. Diarrhea: Patient began experiencing diarrhea on the day of
discharge. He was afebrile, without an increase in his WBC. A C.
Diff was sent.
