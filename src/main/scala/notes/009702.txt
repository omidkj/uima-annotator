Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8480**]
Chief Complaint:
Laryngeal cancer

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy, tracheal biopsy ([**5-15**])
Total Laryngectomy ([**5-23**])


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 56 year old male who presented to [**Hospital 1727**] Medical
Center on [**5-8**] with stridor and respiratory distress.  Prior to
presentation he had complained of 5 weeks of cough, shortness of
breath, and a sore throat for which he had been treated with
steroids and antibiotics without improvement.  A laryngoscopy at
the OSH showed severe narrowing of the subglottic area and CT
scan showed a large laryngeal mass concerning for neoplasm.  An
emergent trachestomy/bronchoscopy was done by the thoracic
surgery team and biopsy of the mass were sent.  These biopsies
were suspicious for adenoid cystic carcinoma.  Of note,
bronchial washings were sent which were positive for MSSA.  He
was therefore started at cefazolin and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care.

Past Medical History:
1. h/o sinus surgery
2. Chest tube placed [**2076**], unknown reason
3. LLE fracture after MVC [**2081**]

Denies alcohol use
Smoked 1ppd tobacco for 30 years but quit 1 month prior to
presentation
Works as an electrician

Supraglottis appears slightly erythematous, no obvious mass
lesions are seen. Vocal cords have a small amount of abduction
bilaterally, but to a maximum of 2mm opening. No true vocal fold
lesions are seen but cannot rule out a submucosal thickening of

circumferential narrowing below tracheotomy tip, but patent

.......RADIOLOGY STUDIES:
...[**5-14**] CT TRACHEA
FINDINGS: A tracheostomy tube is present, with tip terminating
within the anterior tracheal lumen above the level of the aortic
arch.

The glottic, subglottic and proximal trachea appear diffusely
abnormal. Within the glottic and subglottic airway, diffuse soft
tissue thickening is present with narrowing of the airway lumen.
The thickening is most pronounced posteriorly and laterally and
results in luminal narrowing to approximately 4 mm in transverse
dimension by about 7-9 mm in the anterior dimension.
Additionally, in the proximal trachea at the level of the
thyroid gland, there is a more discrete 12 mm x 11 mm diameter
rounded intraluminal opacity. This is contiguous more inferiorly
with circumferential wall thickening. The tracheal walls remain
mildly thickened to approximately the level of the aortic arch.
Diffuse stranding is present throughout the adjacent
paratracheal fat, most prominent above the level of the aortic
arch, but continues in a milder degree below this level to the
subcarinal region. Increased number of mediastinal nodes are
present, but there are no individual nodes measuring greater
than 1 cm in diameter. Air is identified within the tracheal
soft tissues adjacent to the tracheostomy tube, as well as
within the adjacent subcutaneous tissues adjacent to the
pectoralis muscles, probably reflecting recent placement of the
tube. A small amount of pneumomediastinum is also present.

Multiple pulmonary emboli are present throughout the right
pulmonary arterial system, involving the origin of the right
middle lobe bronchus and extending into segmental branches, and
also involving the intralobar and proximal right lower lobe
pulmonary artery extending into segmental and subsegmental
arteries.

Within the lungs, extensive upper lobe predominant centrilobular
emphysema is present. Multiple peribronchiolar ground glass
nodular opacities are present in the superior segment of the
right lower lobe and a small solid 3-mm diameter left lower lobe
nodule (image 48, series 3) is also present, as well as an
additional 3 mm left lower lobe nodule laterally (imaged 220,
series 4).

Images obtained during dynamic expiration are suboptimal as the
patient did not appear to be able to cooperate with the
breathing instructions.

Trace right pleural effusion is present.

No suspicious lytic or blastic skeletal lesions are identified.

Multiplanar and 3D images confirm the presence of an
intraluminal mass and adjacent luminal narrowing as well as
circumferential thickening of the airway.

Additionally, on review of thin section axial images, there is
apparent partial destruction of the cricoid cartilage.

IMPRESSION:

1. Proximal tracheal intraluminal mass with contiguous
circumferential thickening of the airway extending proximal to
the level of the vocal cords. Apparent cricoid cartilage
destruction. Less prominent wall thickening below the mass
extending at least to the level of the aortic arch with
extensive stranding of the adjacent paratracheal fat. Findings
are concerning for circumferential involvement of adenoid cystic
carcinoma with associated extensive submucosal spread.
Correlation with bronchoscopy findings recommended.

2. Increased number of mediastinal nodes, without individual
nodes meeting size criteria for enlargement. Malignant
involvement is not excluded.

3. Acute pulmonary emboli in the right pulmonary arterial system
as described.

4. Two solid left lower lobe lung nodules, measuring less than 5
mm in diameter. Although potentially benign, early foci of
metastatic disease cannot be excluded. Attention to these on a
three-month followup CT may be helpful.

5. Peribronchiolar ground glass nodules superior segment of
right lower lobe, likely due to aspiration or early infection.

6. Small right pleural effusion.
.
...[**5-15**] CHEST PA/LAT:
The patient is diagnosed with adenoid cystic carcinoma of the
trachea. Tracheostomy is in place with its tip projecting 8.4 cm
above the carina. The heart size and the mediastinal contours
are unremarkable. The lungs are clear. There is no pleural
effusion. The sub 5-mm left lower lobe nodules diagnosed on the
chest CT are below the resolution of this chest radiograph.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia. Tracheostomy in place.

Known adenoid cystic carcinoma of upper trachea.
.
...[**5-15**] BRONCHOSCOPY
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  The patient was consented and
topical lidocaine was given in the oropharynx in the usual
fashion. The bronchoscope was inserted via the mouth. On
inspection of the posterior pharynx there was diffuse tissue
infiltration throughout with crowding of the airway. The
vocal cords were visible only on deep inspiration. Their
movement through the inspiratory cycle could not be well
visualized. The scope was not inserted past the vocal cords
via that approach. The bronchoscope was removed and then
reinserted via the tracheostomy. The airways were normal in
appearance grossly distal to the tracheostomy. On
endotracheal ultrasound immediately distal to the
tracheostomy there was diffuse tracheal infiltration. An
endobronchial biopsy was taken x2 at the carina as well as on
the right and on the left just distal to the trach. There was
some mild oozing after the biopsy which spontaneously
resolved. The patient did well throughout the procedure.

OVERALL IMPRESSION:
1.  Diffuse posterior pharyngeal tissue infiltration.
2.  Diffuse tracheal thickening by ultrasound.

...[**5-17**] BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND:
No prior studies for comparison. Bilateral [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-scale and
Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] were performed of the common femoral,
superficial femoral, and popliteal veins. On the right, there is
noncompressible thrombus within the right popliteal vein, which
is only partially occlusive. There appears to be a small amount
of flow tr
