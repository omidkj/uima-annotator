Chief Complaint:
Seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
   44 yo M with h/o HIV/AIDS, last CD4 123, most recent VL <50
(one month prior), and hx of CNS [**Hospital 38229**] transferred from [**Hospital3 56608**]Med Center after an episode of witnessed tonic
clonic seizures that lasted 10 minutes while riding in a car.
Pt arrived in ED with seizure.  Seizure was broken with 8mg
ativan in the ED.  Pt was reported to have a significant post
ictal period and was intubated to protect his airway.  Pt was
loaded with dilantin at [**Location (un) **].  Prior to this episode pt had
experienced 2 days of fever, and uri sx.
   The pt's wife reports the first episode of seizure was
approximately 1.5 years ago.  This led to a workup that revealed
CNS toxoplasmosis and his diagnosis of HIV.  The seizure left
the pt with a residual left hemiparesis.  His second episode of
seizure occured two month ago when he was witnessed to have had
letward head deviation, altered awareness and picking movements
o his right hand towards his left hand.
   HIV was diagnosed in the setting of his first seizure as
above.  He has been treated with HAART in the past with a
?compliance and poor response.  The patient is currently being
tx'd with epivir, ritonovir and atazanavir (2PPI+NRTI).  He has
not had any other opportunistic infections in the past (aside
from toxo).  He was recently taken off azithromycin due to CD 4
count of 123.
.


Past Medical History:
1.  SZ - two prior episodes (1st one 1.5years ago, 2nd one two
months previous)

Renal US [**2109-9-30**]:
"The right kidney measures 13.5 cm, and the left kidney measures
11.3 cm. Images of the left kidney are somewhat limited. Both
kidneys demonstrate normal cortical thickness and echogenicity.
There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, stone, or mass in either
kidney. No perinephric fluid collections are seen. A Foley
catheter is seen within a collapsed bladder.

IMPRESSION:
No evidence of hydronephrosis. "

CXR [**2109-9-30**]:
"CLINICAL INDICATION: Status post seizure. Intubated.
An endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position. A nasogastric
tube terminates within the proximal stomach, but the side port
is likely above the GE junction level. Cardiac and mediastinal
contours are normal. There are patchy opacities present in the
infrahilar regions bilaterally. The lungs otherwise appear
grossly clear.
IMPRESSION:
1. Satisfactory position of ET tube.
2. Nasogastric tube side port is likely above the GE junction.
3. Patchy opacities in the infrahilar regions bilaterally, which
may be due to aspiration or atelectasis. "
.
.
CXR [**2109-10-1**]:
"IMPRESSION:
1) Satisfactory position of ET tube.
2) Unchanged position of the nasogastric tube, whose side port
may lie above the gastroesophageal junction.
3) New areas of linear segmental patchy atelectasis bilaterally.
4) Possible mild left ventricular failure."

.
EEG [**2109-9-30**]:
"FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: There are scattered theta frequency intrusions
most
prominent over the right centro-parietal region at the T4, P4
contacts.
These are of mild amplitude.
ABNORMALITY #2: Occasional mild theta frequency slowing was also
seen
over the left temporal region.
ABNORMALITY #3: There is occasional low amplitude generalized
delta
frequency slowing.
BACKGROUND: Is obscured by beta frequency activity in the 15 Hz
frequency range.
HYPERVENTILATION: Was not performed due to the patient's
clinical
condition.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Was not performed because the
study
was a portable study.
SLEEP: Normal transitions of the sleep architecture were not
seen;
however, variations within the amplitude of the background
rhythm over
the course of the record was observed with increased amplitude
in the
setting of movement.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 66 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence
of
scattered theta frequency intrusions mo
