Service:  PCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 85-year-old woman
with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft times two in [**2094-12-27**],
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia,
who presented with increasing frequency and severity of her
anginal symptoms for five days and was found to be in
intermittent AV block on admission.  For the past few months,
patient has had increasing fatigue.  She has had chronic
intermittent neck tightness and jaw pain, which is her
anginal equivalent for years, but since Wednesday, [**8-1**], has had increasing frequency and severity of these
episodes associated with weakness, lightheadedness, and
diaphoresis.  The patient usually is doing some form of mild
exertion like combing her hair when these episodes have
occurred.  She has taken sublingual nitroglycerin with some
of these episodes with questionable relief.  No associated
dyspnea, nausea, vomiting or cough.  Episodes last seconds to
minutes.  She does experience palpitations with these
episodes.

On the day of admission, the patient went to see her
Cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1147**], where an electrocardiogram showed
a question of second degree AV block.  She was then sent to
the Emergency Room at [**Hospital1 **] Hospital where
she was found to have intermittent complete heart block on
electrocardiogram with an atrial rate of 60 and a junctional
escape rhythm of 40.  She was hemodynamically stable.  She
has had no recent fevers, chills, dysuria, abdominal pain,
diarrhea or bright red blood per rectum.  She has had
increased exacerbation of her seasonal allergies recently.

In the Emergency Room, she was given atropine and one
sublingual nitroglycerin with good response.  Intermittently
in the Emergency Room, she went into normal sinus rhythm and
then back into complete heart block.  She was also having
intermittent bigeminy and trigeminy.  Transcutaneous pads
were placed and she was started on a nitroglycerin drip.  On
the night of admission, an A line was placed in her left
wrist radial artery and after several hours after admission,
she did go into normal sinus rhythm with PR prolongation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Cardiovascular system:

A.  Coronaries:  Patient was continued on aspirin and
Lipitor.  She was placed on a nitroglycerin drip to titrate
for chest pain.  A myocardial infarction was ruled out with
negative CKs and troponin.  At first it was thought to do a
cardiac catheterization given her unstable angina and
complete heart block not knowing the relationship between
them, but then it was thought to be an intrinsic arrhythmia
rather than being caused by ischemia.  On the second day of
admission, the patient's electrocardiogram showed sinus
bradycardia with prolonged PR interval.  She was weaned off
the nitroglycerin drip and did not require any more drip or
sublingual nitroglycerin.  On [**8-7**], the patient had a
DDD pacemaker placed and electrocardiogram with and without
magnet following the procedure was within normal limits.

B.  Myocardium:  The patient was in mild congestive heart
failure on admission.  She was continued on her Diovan.
Reportedly, her left ventricular ejection fraction was 70%.
Her diuresis was initially held secondary to her low blood
pressures on admission.  An echocardiogram to evaluate her
ejection fraction function was considered, however, it was
decided to defer this to outpatient management.  She is
continued on her Imdur, Aldactone, and on hospital day number
two, she was restarted on her home dose of Lasix for preload
reduction.

C.  Conduction:   Patient was in complete heart block on
admission, thought to be either secondary to underlying
ischemia versus intrinsic conductive disease.  It was thought
more likely for her to have intrinsic conductive disease.
She was maintained on telemetry.  Beta blocker and calcium
channel blocker were avoided until after her pacemaker was
placed.  Her electrolytes were repleted as needed.  Patient
did not become unstable prior to having the pacemaker placed,
so she did not need temporary wire to be
