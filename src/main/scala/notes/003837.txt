Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 477**]
Chief Complaint:
HYPOXIA, HYPOTENSION

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is 73 yo M with metastatic prostate cancer on
clinical trial drug a past history of CAD, CHF EF 45%.  In
clinic one week prior to admission, he appeared to be volume
overloaded, so lasix was increased.  The day of admission he was
hypoxic in clinic today to 86%, and found to be anemic. Pt also
endorsed light headedness and dizziness for several days since
chemo. Denies any CP until morning of admit when he had episode
of SSCP that lasted "seconds", relieved by nitro.
.
In the ED: 99.5 107/41 94 20 78% RA -> 94% 4L. BP transiently
dropped to 70/41 but improved with 1L IVF and 1u pRBC. CXR
showed worsening pulm congestion with possible right sided PNA.
BNP 3000. Given ceftriaxone and azithro. No diuresis. EKG showed
NSR, 1st degree AV block, NA w Q in III and aVF and STD I aVL
and slight ST elevation in II and aVF, TWI V1-V3. Worse then
prior.
.
He was initially admitted to the floor, where he was noted on
arrival to be in mild repiratory distress. Given that the
working diagnosis was volume overload, he was given 20 mg of IV
lasix with a resulting drop in blood pressure to 80's systolic.
Patient triggered for hypotension, ICU consult initiated.
.
At time of evaluation, BP 80/40, HR 100, RR 20, 87% on 5L NC,
96% on NRB. ABG obtained at that time revealed pH 7.45 pCO2 34
pO2 111 HCO3  24.  He was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for a lasix drip.

Review of systems at the time of admisison was notable for
increasing DOE x 1 week. Denies any blood in stool or dark tarry
stools. Has not had any coughing, no nausea or vomiting, no
fevers or chills. No orthopnea, sleeps with one pillow flat on
his back. No dysuria or rashes. No abd pain. Poor PO intake.
Review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 yo M with metastatic prostate cancer on clinical trial drug a
past history of CAD, CHF EF 45%, anemia, presenting with fatigue
and DOE x 1 week, now with hypotension and hypoxia.
.
#. Hypoxia:  His CXR showed volume overload.  His fluid overload
was thought to be secondary to the prednisone he was taking in
conjunction of his study drug. He was agressively diuresed while
in the ICU.  He was placed on a lasix drip and also given
boluses of lasix.  His  fluid balance in the ICU was 4.7 liters
negative.  His oxygen was weaned from a high flow mask to 4L NC.
 His cardiac enzymes were cycled and were negative thus making
an ischemic event unlikely.  An echo was done which showed EF of
50%, improved from prior.  He was continued on his ASA and
statin.  On the OMED service gentle diuresis with IV lasix was
continued for one day, O2 was weaned to 2L and then RA, and lung
sounds improved.  However, he subsequently developed increasing
oxygen requirement, recurrent crackles, and hypoxia without
elevated JVP or peripheral edema. CXR was again suggestive of
pulmonary edema.  However, there was doubt that this could fully
explain his clinical situation.  Given erratic hypoxia,
pulmonary artery hypertension on echo, and recent use of
taxotere, chest CT was done.  This demonstrated likely
pneumonitis.   This was thought to be possibly secondary to
taxotere.  Pulse-dose steroids were begun and quickly tapered
from IV to 60 mg PO prednisone.  The pulmonary team followed the
patient.  He continued to have a 3L O2 requirement with
desaturation into the 70s with exertion.  Given this lack of
improvement over a week, there was concern for PCP given his
history of prednisone use.  He was started on Bactrim at
prophylactic doses.  Induced sputum collection was attempted but
unsuccessful.  Thus, he was taken for bronchoscopy and BAL,
which was negative for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] oxygen requirement continued,
so he was sent home with home O2 and plans to continue the
prednisone and follow-up with his oncologist to arrange for
PFTs, to attempt to taper prednisone, and for a possible
referral to outpatient pulmonary and/or repeat CT if he didn't
improve clinically.
.
#. Hypotension: SBP ranged high 70s to low 90s in the ICU.  On
the OMED service SBP initially ~100 but fell back into the 70s
to 80s, limiting diuresis. The cause was unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] was
afebrile, with negative blood cultures and no evidence of
sepsis.  CHF may have been contributory, although echo showed a
nearly normal EF and only mild valve disease. The patient was
persistently asymptomatic.  In fact he was energetic and
ambulatory through the hallway with this blood pressure.  His
beta blocker may need to be restarted as an outpatient given his
history of coronary disease.
.
#. EKG changes: The patient had inferior ST changes on admission
EKG.  These were though to be secondary to demand ischemia in
the setting of known CAD. Troponins were elevated in the setting
of renal failure and increased demand.  His CKs trended down and
his CK-MB were flat.  He was persistently without chest pain. He
was continued on his ASA and ACE.  Imdur was held for low blood
pressure but may be restarted as an outpatient if needed for
symptom control.
.
#. Metastatic prostate cancer: He had been on experimental drug
therapy which was discontinued per the recommendations of
oncology.  He had been on prednisone 10mg daily, recently
tapered to 7.5 mg daily, in conjunction with the drug.
.
#. Chronic pain:  Outpatient opiate regimen was continued to
treat bony metastases.  Pain was well controlled on this regimen
.
#. Anemia: This was likely secondary to malignancy and recent
chemotherapy. He was transfused one unit
