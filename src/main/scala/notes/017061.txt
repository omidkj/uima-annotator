Chief Complaint:
Abdominal discomfort

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
56 yo M w/ DM, HTN, EtOH/HCV cirrhosis presented as transfer
from OSH for ERCP, and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] tonight after
anesthesia did not feel comfortable extubating pt. Per ERCP
fellow (no OSH records in chart), pt presented to [**Hospital1 3793**] 1 week ago with delta ms, abdominal pain, and elevated
LFTs. He also reported a weight loss on ROS (unclear
amount/duration). AST 46, ALT 81, total bili 1.5, alk phos 217.
An abdominal CT showed a possible pancreatic head mass and liver
lesions c/w mets. He was transferred here for ERCP for further
evaluation.
.
He was electively intubated for ERCP due to concern for his
airway given delta ms and h/o COPD. Procedure showed a minimally
dilated pancreatic duct without stricture, and otherwise
completely normal study. Per fellow and attg, very unlikely to
have pancreatic head mass. Post-procedure, anesthesia did not
feel comfortable extubating pt due to lethargy, inconsistently
following commands. He asked the pt to be transferred to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further monitoring and extubation when mental status
improved.
.
In [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], following commands, indicating that he wanted to be
extubated. His RSBI was 21 and tolerated a SBT of 5/0 for 45 min
comfortably. He was extubated to shovel mask with sats 95%.

ERCP:
Medications: general anesthesia
Glucagon 0.6 mg

ASA Class: P4
Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential
complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his
understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. A
physical exam was performed. The patient was administered
general anesthesia. The patient was placed in the prone position
and an endoscope was introduced through the mouth and advanced
under direct visualization until the second part of the duodenum
was reached. Careful visualization was performed. The procedure
was not difficult. The quality of the preparation was good. The
patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
complications.
Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: Normal major papilla
Cannulation:  Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with
a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium
was injected resulting in complete opacification. Cannulation of
the pancreatic duct was performed with a 5-4-3 tapered catheter
using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium was injected
resulting in complete opacification.
Biliary Tree: The common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right
and left hepatic ducts, biliary radicles and cystic duct were
filled with contrast and well visualized. The course and caliber
of the structures are normal with no evidence of extrinsic
compression, no ductal abnormalities, and no filling defects
Pancreas: The main pancreatic duct was mildly dilated with no
strictures or other irregularity.
Impression: 1.  Normal biliary tree.

2.  The main pancreatic duct was mildly dilated with no
strictures or other irregularity.

Recommendations: Juices today when awake, alert and at baseline
Return to outside hospital under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1968**] [**Name (STitle) **] care
Consider liver biopsy if diagnosis is uncertain of liver lesions
seen on CT.


Brief Hospital Course:
56 yo M w/ EtOH and HCV cirrhosis, COPD on [**Name (NI) 100741**] (unclear true
pulm function), bipolar/ schizophrenia presented to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] post
ERCP for monitoring mental status prior to extubation, now
extubated.
.
1. Respiratory: Patient was intubated electively for airway
protection given mental status, rather than respiratory
failure-- now s/p extubation. His ABG still shows respiratory
acidosis. His exam shows mild rales, and patient has history of
COPD. His CXR was signfiicant for atelectasis as well as hilar
congestion c/w fluid overload and poor inspiratory efforts. His
respiratory acidosis was likely secondary to poor ventilation
from atelectasis, COPD, as well as possible pulm edema. Patient
was given 20 mg IV Lasix. On transfer patient was on NC with
oxygen sats in the mid-90s. He was also given nebs prn.
.
2. Delta MS: It was unclear how much was his baseline, given
multiple potential insults including liver disease, bipolar,
schizophrenia. Patient was placed on a CIWA scale, but showed no
evidence of withdrawal or agitaiton. His LFTs were followed and
were stable. His psych meds were held because doses were
unknown.
.
3. GI: It was unclear how referred for pancreatic mass eval but
no abnormalities per ERCP. His LFTs/amylase/lipase were stable.
ERCP was negative for dilatation. It is possible that patient
has intrahepatic obstruction, and liver biopsy may be indicated
if lesions are still suspected. Reimaging would also be helpful
for characterization of lesions.
.
4. DM: Patient was placed on FSBG QID, with ISS. His diet was
advanced.
.
5. FEN: Patient was NPO overnight, and was placed on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] diet
in am.

6. Proph: Patient was given subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots,
and protonix PPI.
.
7. Dispo: Patient was stabilized, and returned to [**Hospital 487**]
