Chief Complaint:
respiratory distress, slurred speech

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19017**] is a 69-year-old male with past medical history
significant for severe COPD on home oxygen at 4L, HTN, GERD, CAD
(prior NSTEMI), hyperlipidemia, h/o resistant pseudomonas PNA
and chronic back pain who was brought to ED via EMS after wife
noticed he had worse confusion and altered mentation this
evening. Patient denies recent cough, fevers, chills or
increased/discolored sputum production. Of note, he had recent
ED visit on [**4-5**] for worse weakness and depression and was seen
by psychiatry and SW and discharged home. Much of history
collected from wife given patient's AMS.

In ED a fentanyl patch was noticed on his back and he was having
some slurred speech so there was concern for narcotic induced
hypercarbia after initial ABG showed pH 7.28, pCO2 116, pO2 56,
HCO3 57. He is also taking Ativan and Percocet at home regularly
for anxiety and low back pain. He complained of some generalized
weakness along with 1 week of more focal right hand weakness.
Therefore, neurology was called to evaluate him in ED and his
exam was non-focal. A CT head was done which was unremarkable.
Neuro recommended CTA head and neck.  There was also concern for
COPD flare up from possible infection as well but CXR was
unremarkable for PNA.

Initial vitals in ED were: T98.2F, HR 93, BP 137/77, RR 28 and
O2 Saturation 99% on 6L. He was given albuterol nebs,
ipratropium nebs, 125mg IV Solumedrol, 1g IV Ceftriaxone, 500mg
IV Azithromycin and Naloxone .4mg x1 for presumed narcotic
induced respiratory distress. He became quite agitated after
Naloxone so he was given 2.5mg IV Haldol. Lactate was normal at
0.8 and he also had hyperkalemia to 5.4 range. WBC count was
normal at 8.6 and Hct near baseline at 37.2. FSG was 184. Repeat
ABG much improved s/p BIPAP with pH 7.36, pCO2
85, pO2 65, HCO3 50.

On evaluation in the MICU, he appeared confused, somewhat
agitated and was not cooperative with initial questions but then
calmed down within minutes and was able to give a limited
history. Speech somewhat garbled at baseline and patient was
only oriented to place and year but did not know month or why
exactly he was in ICU.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per HPI. Limited ROS otherwise due to
patient's AMS. Patient also endorses decreased appetite and wife
also corroborates poor PO intake x 1 week.

IMAGING:

CXR ([**2108-4-17**]) - FINDINGS: As compared to the previous
radiograph, there is no evidence of newly appeared focal
parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. Unchanged
hyperinflation of both lungs, the right lung base is better
ventilated than on the previous examination. No pleural
effusions. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Moderate
tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.

CXR ([**2108-4-15**]) -  IMPRESSION: COPD. No definite signs of
pneumonia. If needed, correlation with a lateral view may aid.

CT Head ([**2108-4-15**]) - IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

Brief Hospital Course:
69-year-old male with severe COPD on home 4L NC, HTN,
hyperlipidemia, CAD, GERD, depression and chronic back pain on
multiple sedating pain medications and psychiatric medications
who presented with AMS, hypercarbic respiratory distress.

# Severe COPD & Hypercarbic Respiratory Distress: Initial
desaturations and hypercarbia was felt to be related to
narcotic- and benzodiazepine-induced respiratory depression. He
is also a CO2-retainer at baseline. Patient had been taking
fentanyl patches, percocet, and ativan at home. The patient had
cultures with no growth, was afebrile, and had a clear CXR,
making infection less likely. Moreover, he had no sputum changes
or worse cough from usual baseline. He was initially treated as
a COPD exacerbation with albuterol/ipratropium nebs, solumedrol,
ceftriaxone, azithromycin. Ceftriaxone was ultimately stopped,
and steroids were switched to oral prednisone. He was continued
on a 5-day course of azithromycin. While he was in the MICU,
meetings were held with the patient, his family, and the
palliative care team. Given his advanced end stage COPD status
and his wished to focus on his comfort, the patient was made CMO
(comfort measures only). He was given the option of BiPAP to
help with his breathing but did not
