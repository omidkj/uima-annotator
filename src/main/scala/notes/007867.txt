Images:
CT Abd/Pelvis [**2174-9-7**]: Cardiomegaly is noted with calcification
along the mitral annulus. Atelectatic changes are noted at the
lung bases bilaterally. The liver appears shrunken with a
slightly nodular contour suggesting underlying cirrhosis.
Calcific density layering dependently in the gallbladder is
compatible with stones. There is no biliary ductal dilatation.
Linear calcific densities along the hilum bilaterally are
compatible with atherosclerotic calcification along the renal
arterial branches. Extensive atherosclerosis along the abdominal
aorta and major branch vessels is noted with ectasia of the
infrarenal abdominal aorta measuring up to 3.4 x 3.4 cm. The
upper abdominal aorta is ectatic measuring 3.7 cm at the level
of the diaphragm. There is no free air, free fluid, or
lymphadenopathy. No evidence of ileus or obstruction.   There is
fusion of L4 and L5 vertebral bodies with a L4 spondylolysis
noted bilaterally as well as a mild anterolisthesis of the L4
vertebra relative to [**Name (NI) 13032**]. Degenerative changes are noted at L5-S1
with disc space narrowing and vacuum disc phenomena.
.
[**2174-9-9**] TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic st
