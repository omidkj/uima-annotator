Brief Hospital Course:
1. COPD: The pt presented w/ severe hypoxemia and hypercarbia.
Elevated HcO3 indicates longstanding Hx of COPD. In the MICU,
she was maintained on BiPap at night. IV steroids were continued
and changed to po prednisone on [**1-29**]. Her mental status returned
to normal as her respiratory status improved, and she was
maintaining good SaO2 on NC. By the time she was called out of
the MICU, she was maintaining SaO2 of 88-92% on 2L NC, her
baseline at home. BiPAP was continued overnight for episodes of
apnea (pt had her own machine). She was continued on her
prednisone taper and nebulizers.  Patient is to continue with
Prednisone 40 mg QD for next 7 days and then continue the taper
with decrease by 10 mg over next 7 days to her baseline of 10 mg
QD
.
2. possible CAP: CXR is negative although poor quality [**1-7**] pt's
body habitus. A repeat PA and lateral [**1-31**] was unremarkable. She
was started on CTX and azithro in the ED and the CTX was
discontinued on [**1-30**]. Empiric treatment for CAP w/ azithro for 5
days was continued. Her DFA was positive for influenza A on [**1-29**]
after which she was maintained on droplet precautions. Tamiflu
was not started as the diagnosis was made 24-48 hr after the
onset of symptoms.
.
3. CV
# Pump: Pt w/ hx of severe HTN. She was diuresed for mild fluid
overload in her legs with IV Lasix in the MICU and then switched
to her PO Lasix home dose of 120mg [**Hospital1 **] after being transferred
to the floor. A TTE showed normal EF.  Patient was subsequently
discharged with a lower dose of 80 mg of Lasix [**Hospital1 **] as she
appeared to have contraction alkalosis.  Patient's edema appears
to be at baseline as far as her lower extremity edema.  The
etiology of her total body volume remains unclear after
discussion with patient's PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 23427**] as she does not have
overwhelming largePA pressures and no evidence of severe
diastolic and nl systolic function.
.
# Ischemia: Pt not on ASA [**1-7**] prior hx of bleeding. No BB [**1-7**]
COPD.
.
# Rhythm:
- h/o PAF - not while in house, stable.  Patient is on
amiodarone which was continued. She states she has not been on
Coumadin for the last several months due to presumed GIB.
- h/o MAT - patient appeared to be in intermittent MAT.  She was
rate controlled with Diltiazem XR.  Which she tolerated well.
.
# GI: Pt has hx of GERD. No signs of active GI bleeding. PPI was
continued.
.
# Alkalosis and Hypochloremia - patient with alkalosis to HCO3
of 48, but her baseline pCO2 is in 70s.  This perhaps was
further exacerbated by aggressive diuresis with IV lasix.
Patient's hypochloremia corrected while her lasix was held and
reduced however restarting home dose she worsened again.
Patient is thus being discharged on lower than her home dose in
order to correct contraction alkalosis that may be contributing
to her elevated bicarb.
.
Dispo - patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23427**] her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
patient, she has an appointment on [**2190-2-12**].
