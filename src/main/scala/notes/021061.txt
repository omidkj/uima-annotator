HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The following discharge summary
will cover the time period from [**10-15**] through [**2183-10-28**].
Please see previous discharge summary for information on
patient's admission diagnosis and medications.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Gastrointestinal.  On [**10-16**] the patient developed nausea,
vomiting and abdominal pain.  Because of this she was not
discharged to rehabilitation at [**Location (un) 511**] Center Hospital
as had been previously planned.  Due to her symptoms a CT
scan was obtained which revealed the patient had an ileus.
There were no abscesses or other processes that could be
identified.  The neurology service was consulted regarding
possibility of this ileus being related to the patient's
myopathy but felt this was unlikely since skeletal muscle
myopathies typically do not also involve smooth muscle of the
Gastrointestinal tract.  A Gastrointestinal consult was
obtained who had no additional thoughts on what could be
causing the patient's ileus and recommended bowel rest. The
patient was kept off tube feeds for two days after which time
they were restarted at a low rate of 20 cc's an hour as
compared to her goal rate of 65 cc's per hour.  The patient
appeared to tolerate this reasonably well and the tube feeds
were increased.  When they reached the rate of 30 cc's an
hour however the patient developed nausea and vomiting a
second time.  Tube feeds were again stopped and her bowel was
rested for several days.

On [**10-24**] it was decided that because the patient was unable
to tolerate tube feeds at a reasonable rate she would be
started on TPN for nutrition.  At the time of this dictation
on [**10-27**] the patient was reporting decreased abdominal pain
and no further nausea or vomiting.  She additionally had been
successful in moving her bowels and treated with Colace,
Senokot and Fleet enemas.  The suspicion of the team at this
point in time is that her ileus is resolving however, very
slowly.  Her tube feeds will need to be started at a very
slow rate, advanced extremely gently as tolerated with
caution being taken because when the rate is increased to
abruptly she does tend to develop nausea and vomiting.  She
will be discharged out on no tube feeds, they can be started
when she arrives at [**Location (un) 511**] Center for rehabilitation.
She will be discharged out on TPN which she can continue.
Additionally we will maintain her on [**Doctor Last Name **] and Colace.

2.  Pulmonary.  The patient continued to do well on a trach
mask and in fact tolerated trach mask ventilation for five
days in a row with no support from mechanical ventilator.
Because of this she was deemed safe to go to the floor
something which the team and the patient's family were very
happy with as it was thought this could be a trial
preliminary to transferring her to rehabilitation home.  On
[**10-21**] she was transferred to the floor. Unfortunately however,
on [**10-22**] she was found to be hypoxic to the low 80's on the
floor.  She was suctioned with thick tenacious dark
secretions came out, her O2 sats increased to the mid-80's.
Chest x-ray was consistent with a left sided opacity
throughout which was new.  She was transferred back to the
Intensive Care Unit with ventilatory support and bronchoscopy
was performed which revealed purulent drainage from the left
mainstem, sample was sent.  Chest x-ray after bronchoscopy
revealed markedly improved air space.  O2 saturations
increased to 98% on only .4 FIO2.  Following this episode the
patient was rested in IMV for several days.  At the time of
this admission she was feeling better and feeling strong
enough to try pressor support ventilation again.

The teams thinking is that perhaps the patient needs to be
rested each night in an MV mode letting her use only a trach
mask for five days may have been to much to soon and in the
future we will get her to tolerate pressor support and rest
her on the night and possibly during the day allowing her to
breath through the trach mask.  Currently she is being
weaned, this will need to be continued at [**Hospital1 **].

Per discussion with the family the pulmonary attending is
planning to call the pulmonary attending at [**Hospital1 **]
to communicate the patient's need regarding ventilatory
management.

3.  Infectious disease.  On [**10-16**] the patient's urine grew out
Enterobacter which was sensitive only to Mirpenum and one
other [**Doctor Last Name 360**].  She was treated with Mirpenum for seven days.
At approximate completion of the 7 days course the patient's
BAL sample from her bronch grew out pseudomonas which was
resistant to Mirpenum.  Because of this switched to Zosyn
which the pseudomonas was sensitive to.  She will be
discharged on this and need to complete a 10 to 14 day
course.  Additionally she was started on Flagyl for possible
C. diff given that she was complaining of abdominal pain and
was feeling extremely weak.  Of note, she did not have
diarrhea.  She did seem to get better after starting the
Flagyl so she will need to complete a 14 day course of this
as well for empiric therapy for C. diff.

Also of note the patient had one set of blood cultures
positive for coag negative staph however, it was deemed that
this was a contaminant and the decision was made not to treat
after consultation with Infectious Disease service.

4.  Neurological.  The patient continued to show improvement
in her strength while on 60 mg of Prednisone a day.  The
original plan had been for her to be treated for 4 weeks with
60 mg of Prednisone empirically and then follow-up with the
neuromuscular service for a decision as to whether or not to
continue this.  However, after approximately 2-1/2 weeks of
therapy the patient had issues with infectious disease as
detailed above including urinary tract infection and
pulmonary infection.  Because of these issues, with highly
resistant bacteria it was deemed that the best thing to do
would be to taper the steroids.

On approximately [**10-22**] the patient was cut from 60 to 40 mg of
Prednisone a day and on [**10-27**] the day of this dictation the
patient was cut to 20 mg a day.  She will need to continue
this slow taper until the steroids had been weaned to off.
If her improvement in neurologic function continues even off
the steroids then she can probably never start on steroids
again however, if she shows a decline once she is off
steroids this will further enforce the theory that the
steroids are what has been treating her myopathy and once she
is clear for infectious issues she should be restarted on
steroids in the future.  She will follow-up with the
neuromuscular service as detailed in her previous discharge
summary.

5.  Psychiatric.  On one occasion the patient during the
night the patient became quite despondent and request that
she did not wish to continue with this therapy as she was
incredibly frustrated.  However, the team had multiple
discussions on their rounds and at the time of this dictation
the patient's mood had significantly improved and her will to
fight on actually seemed quite remarkable.  She is continued
on her Paxil and at the present time the team did not see any
need for additional psychiatric intervention.

6.  Communication.  A family meeting was held on [**2183-10-27**]
with the patient's two daughters, son and husband as well as
the attending physician in the Intensive Care Unit Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **],
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] the former Intensive Care Unit attending, myself
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 916**] and the patient's PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Discussion was held
as to the patient's status.  We discussed the fact that the
family had previously wished for the patient to have
resolution of all her issues prior to going to
rehabilitation.  However, we explained that her issues seemed
to be taking quite sometime the resolve and that we will have
to accept the fact that her issues are stable and improving
although not completely resolved.  Additionally was discussed
the fact that the patient was clearly ready for
re
