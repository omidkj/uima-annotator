Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Eye blurriness and Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right and Left Heart Catheterization
Mitral valve valvuloplasty

History of Present Illness:
72 year old female with h/o CAD s/p CABG in [**2138**], PCI [**2151**], and
left CEA who presented with left eye blurriness one week ago and
was found to have severe carotid restenosis of CEA.  She is
being transferred from her outpatient cardiologist's office at
[**Hospital6 33**].

She states that she has had multiple episodes of left eye
blurriness that she describes as  "grey veil" that comes down
over her eye.  Her most recent episode was 5 days ago and lasted
approximately 1-1.5 hours.  She denies any other symptoms such
as dizziness, HA, weakness, dysphagia, slurred speech, or
altered mental status.  She does mention that she feels neck
tenderness on the left side that developed about the same time
as her symptoms.

She also mentions chronic progressive dyspnea on exertion that
has worsened substantially since the spring of this year.  She
states that she can walk a flight of stairs, but it takes her a
very long time.  She gets short of breath going to the bathroom
across the room. She denies orthopnea or peripheral edema.  She
occasionally wakes up at night short of breath, but this happens
rarely.  She also endorses a chronic cough.  She denies any
history of chest pain.

On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.

[**2153-11-8**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm. Normal tracing. Compared to the previous tracing
there is no
significant change.

[**2153-11-8**] Chest Xray:
Mild cardiomegaly and a small right pleural effusion.

[**2153-11-8**] CTA Head/Neck:
1. High-grade stenosis of the proximal left internal carotid
artery
associated with soft plaque and presence of a "string sign"
extending over an approximately 5-6 mm segment.
2. 40% stenosis of the proximal right internal carotid artery.
3. Moderate atherosclerotic disease at the aortic arch with
40-50% stenosis at the origins of the common carotid arteries,
bilaterally.
4. High-grade stenosis of the proximal right subclavian artery
with what
appears to be complete occlusionl, with reconstitution just
proximal to the origin of the right vertebral artery, raising
the possibility of "subclavian steal" syndrome; this should be
closely correlated clinically.
5. 3-mm left anterolaterally-oriented aneurysm arising from the
anterior
communicating artery, related to aplastic A1 segment of the left
ACA.
6. Post-surgical changes following aneurysm clipping in the
region of the
right carotid terminus.
7. Mediastinal adenopathy and interlobular septal thickening at
the left
apex, which could be further evaluated with a dedicated chest
CT. Reportedly, the patient does have a history of lung cancer,
which
further raises concern of recurrent or metastatic disease given
the superior mediastinal adenopathy; there is possible
lymphangitic carcinomatosis in the left lung apex (these
findings are incompletely imaged).

[**2153-11-9**]: Transthoracic Echo
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure overload. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. There is no significant aortic stenosis or
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe thickening of the mitral
valve chordae. There is moderate to severe mitral stenosis (area
1.0 cm2). The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
tricuspid valve leaflets fail to fully coapt. Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe mitral stenosis. Small and
hypertrophied left ventricle with preserved global systolic
function. Dilated and hypertrophied right ventricle with mild
systolic dysfunction and evidence of pressure overload. Severe
tricuspid regurgitation. Severe pulmonary hypertension.

[**2153-11-12**] CT Chest with Contrast:
No comparison is available. Status post right upper lobectomy.
No evidence of local recurrence. Small bilateral pleural
effusions.
Postsurgical scarring without evidence of lung nodules. Findings
consistent with chronic airways disease, including mucus
bronchial plugging. No pathologically lymph node enlargement in
the mediastinum. Status post cholecystectomy. No adrenal
pathology.

[**2153-11-13**] Cardiac catheterization:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
