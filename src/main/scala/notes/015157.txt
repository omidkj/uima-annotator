Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, tx for left main disease and intraaortic
balloon pump

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p cardiac catheterization with left main, and LAD stents
s/p intraaortic balloon pump and swan ganz catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
80 year old female with CAD s/p CABG '[**09**] (SVG ->LAD), DM, CHF EF
30% presented to OSH with 1 day of shortness of breath,
orthopnea, found to be in CHF, ruled in for NSTEMI, taken to
cath lab found to have significant (?90%) left main disease and
?occlusion of vein graft, elevated PCWP 40, CVP 27, swan and
intraaortic balloon pump were placed and she was diuresed. Her
peak CK was 706 and peak CK-MB 70. She is now being transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of further intervention. When she
underwent CABG in [**2109**], only a graft to the LAD could be
performed, due to diffuse disease in the other vessels and the
aorta was severely calcified and unable to be crossclamped.
.
At OSH, she was started on dobutamine, nipride and heparin gtt.
The dobutamine and nipride were weaned off and per OSH report
prior to transfer, CVP 12, PCWP 20, CO 3.1 CI 1.6 (CI increased
to 2.5 once nipride was restarted). Patient currently feeling
better, much less short of breath, no chest pain. No abd pain.
.
On review of symptoms, denies any prior history of stroke, TIA,
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time
of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. Denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for current absence of
chest pain, currently no dyspnea, PND, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

.
EKG [**2114-6-23**]:
Normal sinus rhythm. Borderline short P-R interval. Delayed R
wave
transition. Occasional premature ventricular contractions. Q
waves in
leads III and aVF suggest possible prior inferior myocardial
infarction.
Downsloping ST segment depressions noted in leads I, aVL and
V5-V6 suggest
possible anterolateral ischemia. Compared to the prior tracing
of [**2110-11-20**] the anterolateral ST segment abnormalities are new.
Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
ECHO [**2114-6-23**]:
Conclusions:
LA is moderately dilated. LV wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal.  Moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction with
thinning and akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls,
and hypokinesis of the anterior wall (lateral wall contracts
best).  Overall LV systolic function is moderately depressed (EF
30%). RV chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The AV
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but AS is not present. No AR.
The MV leaflets are mildly thickened.  Mild (1+) MR is seen.
Mild PA systolic hypertension.
.
IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w
multivessel CAD. Mild pulmonary hypertension. Compared with the
report of the prior study (images unavailable for review) of
[**2110-11-19**], left ventricular function may have slightly declined.
Mild pulmonary hypertension is now identified. The other
findings are similar.
.
Cardiac Catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**]:[**2114-6-25**]
1. Selective angiography of the LMCA showed a heavily calcified
4-4.5 mm
calibre LMCA. mid LMCA there was a tapering 90% leison. The LAD
was
calcified proxially with a 80% lesion. The mid LAD, just prior
to the
SVG TD had a 70% lesion. The LCX had no critical lesions.
2. Limited hemodynamics revealed moderated central aortic
hypertension.
3. The proximal LAD lesion was directly stented with a 3.5 mm
taxus
stent. The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual

stenosis, no dissection, no perforation and no embolisation.(see
PTCA
comments)
4. The LMCA lesion was directly stented with two overlapping 4.0
mm
vision stents and post dilated with the stent balloon and a 4.5
mm
balloon. The final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no
residual
stenosis, no dissection, no perforation and no embolisation.
(see PTCA
comments)
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Critical LMCA lesion with diffuse LAD lesions.
2. Central aortic hyertension
3. Successful stenting of the LAD (Drug eluting)
4. Successful stenting of the LMCA (Bare metal)

Brief Hospital Course:
80 year old female with CAD s/p CABG (SVG->LAD), DM, CHF EF 30%
presented to OSH with CHF, NSTEMI s/p intraaortic balloon pump
during diagnostic cardiac cath with significant left main
disease.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] with intra-aortic balloon
pump in place and underwent repeat cardiac catheterization with
placement of two stents in the LMCA and LAD.
.
# CAD - History of 3VD and CABG with SVG to LAD (unable to
bypass other vessels given diffuse disease). Had NSTEMI at OSH
with peak CK 706, MB 70. During cath at OSH was found to have
significant left main disease and SVG graft occlusion and IABP
was placed. Patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU and continued on
ASA, HD statin, plavix, BBlocker, Heparin gtt. She was taken for
catheterization at [**Hospital1 18**] with stents placed in LAD and LCMA.
IABP was pulled without complications after catheterization. The
patient has been instructed to continue on all her cardiac
medications on discharge and to follow-up with her cardiologist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26770**], at [**Hospital3 **] on [**7-26**]. It is recommended that
she have follow-up imagining to monitor the patency of her LMA
