History of Present Illness:
This is an 82 year old man who presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital
on [**1-18**] for fever and chills for 2 days. He initially called
EMS because he fell to the floor while pending over to pull his
pants up. He told the EMS about his fever and weakness. His
fever was as high as 102.7 at home. At [**Hospital **] Hospital , he
received 4 L of normal saline and imipenem, flagyl, Zosyn, and
CT of the abdomen and plevis. The latter showed multiple liver
abscess. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED where he was
hypotnesive. He received IV fluids, Zosyn, Surgery and ERCP
consultations. The patient has history of hemorrhagic
pancreatitis status post distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy and
multiple debridements, with a history of stents to the
pancreatic duct and biliary stent occlusion with multiple
replacements. He also had multiple hepatic abscesses positive
for Streptococcus milleri treated for 4 weeks with IV
antibiotics i [**2156**]. He also has a history of recent pseudomonas
sepsis in [**8-/2164**] which was treated with Zosyn and Levaquin. Of
note, he also underwent upper and lower endoscopy by his GI
which showed "varices". He denied any GI symptoms excpet
abdominal pain (RUQ) with deep inspiration and mild diarrhea
today and yesterday. ROS: all remaining systems were reviewed
and symptoms were negative.

Past Medical History:
1. Pancreatitis status post distal pancreatectomy ([**2151**]) and
strictures requiring serial dilations and stent placements
2. Diabetes secondary to the pancreatectomy
3. Multiple hepatic abscesses positive for Streptococcus milleri
treated for 4 weeks with IV antibiotics ([**2156**])
4. Pancreatic cutaneous fistula.
5. Status post splenectomy in [**2152-8-31**].
6. Status post open cholecystectomy in [**2150**].
7. Status post right and left total hip arthroplasty.
8. Duodenal ulcer in [**2154**] secondary to NSAID use.
9. Status post left rotator cuff surgery.


Social History:
The patient is divorced. He denies intravenous drug use. He has
a distant smoking history more than 50 years ago, and rare
alcohol use. He lives in [**Location 106997**] living housing for elderly.
Sons and Daughters are in MA and TX.


Family History:
No pancreatitis

Physical Exam:
Temperature of 99.8, blood pressure of 98/60, pulse of 68,
respiratory rate
of 18.  In general, Mr. [**Known lastname 21288**] was an elderly male, appeared
younger than his stated age, in no apparent distress.  HEENT
examination revealed no jaundice or scleral icterus. Oropharynx
was clear.  Neck was supple without meningismus.
Heart examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a
grade 1/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border.
Respiratory examination revealed lungs fields that were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen had normal
active bowel sounds, with mild distention.  There was mild
discomfort in the RUQ to deep palpation, otherwise, nontender.
Extremities were without edema.

ABSCESS CULTURE: WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2165-1-24**]): STREPTOCOCCUS
ANGINOSUS (MILLERI) GROUP. MODERATE GROWTH.

CT-GUIDED drainage: Technically successful ultrasound-guided
aspiration of a 7-mm hepatic lesion concerning for an abscess,
yielding 2 cc of purulent fluid which was sent for microbiologic
analysis.

ECHO: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Liver abscess. Noted to have recurrent pyogenic liver abscess
and underwent IR drainage of the abscess. The pus grew same
bacteria from [**2157**] {STREPTOCOCCUS ANGINOSUS (MILLERI). He was
treated with ceftriaxone and metronidazole and infectious
diseases will follow-up with him on [**2165-2-11**].

2. ARDS. Soon after admission was transferred to the ICU with
severe ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). His CXR
showed diffuse bilateral airspace infiltrates. His
echocardiography was notable for significant pulmonary
regurgitation and diastolic pulmonary hypertension.

3. Diabetes with hypoglycemia. Noted to have episodes of morning
hypoglycemia with down-titration of insulin in response.

4. Hypertension. During hospitalization lisinopril was held with
stable blood pressures. This may be restarted if blood pressure
increases.

5. Diarrhea. Noted to have occasional loose stools. Multiple
c.diff tests were sent and negative. Tihs may be related to
antibiotics or to his chronic pancreatitis.

Discharge Instructions:
You had multiple, small liver abscesses. You underwent drainage
and the pus from one of the liver abscess grew bacteria called
STREPTOCOCCUS ANGINOSUS (MILLERI). It is the same bacteria that
caused you liver abscesses in [**2157**]. You will receive IV
antibiotics for several weeks and see infectious disease doctors
in [**Name5 (PTitle) **] for regular follow up. You were admitted to the MICU
for respiratory failure from ARDS (Acute respiratory distress
syndrome). You underwent MRCP which did not show any areas of
discrete blockage in your bile ducts.
