CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Pneumonia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 40 year old
female with a past medical history of quadriplegia following
C3-C4 spinal injury in [**2139**] status post MVA.  She has anemia,
osteomyelitis, GERD, depression, renal insufficiency for
which she is on chronic steroids, multiple aspiration
pneumonia, intubation five times in the last nine months.
She is MRSA positive with penicillin and sulfa allergies.
She was in her usual state of health prior to hospitalization
when at 5:30 p.m. the patient was smoking outside.  She
called the hospital staff for shortness of breath.  Patient
wanted nasal suction for "jelly stuff."  Patient was given
neb treatment which increased her O2 sat to 89% which later
fell to 87%.  Patient was taken to [**Hospital1 190**] by ambulance.  In the emergency room patient
was given vanco, levo, Flagyl, hydrocortisone, multiple nebs
with improvement in sats.  Patient had sats of 89% in room
air and 100% on 100% nonrebreather.  Patient had increasing
PCO2 blood gas 7.35, 49, 86.  Subsequent blood gas 7.26, 65,
103.  Patient intubated with purulent material rising through
the tube.  Patient received 6 liters of normal saline in the
E.D.  She had previous been admitted for aspiration pneumonia
in [**2145-3-17**].  She was treated with vanc, levo and Flagyl.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature was 96.5, blood pressure
123/90, heart rate 106, respirations 17, sating 100% with 7.5
ET tube.  She had no JVD.  Cardiac regular rate and rhythm.
She was tachy, normal S1, S2.  She had bilateral crackles.
Abdomen had positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender.
Extremities had multiple decubs, yeast and 2+ edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 10.4, bandemia 17, hematocrit
40.1, platelets 119.  All other labs were normal.  UA has
large blood, positive nitrites, pH 8, small leukocyte
esterase, greater than 50 red blood cells, 20 white blood
cells, moderate bacteria.  Chest x-ray pertinent left lower
lobe collapse versus consolidation, blunting of the left
diaphragmatic angle, haziness at the right base, atelectasis,
no effusion and no left catheter tip.  EKG sinus tachy,
normal intervals, axis, no ST-T changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was subsequently extubated on
[**2145-6-5**] in the morning and patient did very well from then.
Patient continued on levo, vanc and Flagyl until [**6-7**], day of
discharge when levo and Flagyl were discontinued because
culture came back MRSA positive sensitive to vancomycin.
Blood cultures remained negative.  Patient will need PFTs for
questionable COPD and respiratory mechanics studied as an
outpatient since this pneumonia might not be aspiration, but
might be due to poor diaphragmatic and chest wall muscular
function with C3-C4 quadriplegia.  Patient probably has low
respiratory reserve.  Would also recommend that patient
discontinue smoking stat.

Infectious disease.  Patient with pneumonia.  Discussed
cultures and previous antibiotics.  Also gave nystatin
powder.

Cardiac.  Patient was tachy.  When we treated the pneumonia
and gave fluids, patient was brady which is her normal state
with C3-C4 quadriplegia.

Neuro.  Patient was sedated over the course of the stay with
propofol because it is easily turned off.  Propofol was
discontinued on the 20th and patient was extubated as
previous mentioned.

Psych.  At the time we just continued her outpatient psych
meds.

GI.  Patient was given an aggressive bowel regimen with a
large bowel movement on [**6-6**].

Renal.  Patient has Foley with leaking around the Foley.  Was
evaluated by GU, but they wanted to do a dye study and the
patient has sulfa allergy, so patient with continue with 30
French catheter Foley.

Extremities.  Patient has multiple decubs which were treated
with wet to dry.  Had wound care nurse evaluate.  Patient was
given frequent turns and First Step mattress was continued on
an outpatient basis.  Decubs are getting better.

Pain.  Patient was treated with Neurontin, Valium, oxycodone
and morphine IV with continued outpatient pain.

Endocrine.  Patient was started on hydrocortisone for renal
insufficiency.  It was subsequently decreased.  Will give
outpatient dose as necessary.

DISPOSITION:  Patient is ready to go back to [**Hospital3 28354**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Patient is in stable condition.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient is stable, ready for [**Hospital3 28354**],
status post pneumonia.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Pneumonia.

DISCHARGE MEDIAL:
1.  Oxycodone 5 q.four.
2.  Zinc.
3.  Prednisone 5 mg p.o. q.day.
4.  Scopolamine q.72 hours.
5.  Albuterol.
6.  Klonopin 0.05 b.i.d.
7.  MS Contin 15 b.i.d.
8.  Zoloft 25 q.day.
9.  Iron 325 t.i.d.
10. Dulcolax and lactulose.
11. Prilosec 20 q.d.
12. Atrovent.
13. Estraderm 0.05 q.three days.
14. Baclofen 38 q.six hours.
15. Neurontin 900 t.i.d.
16. Reglan 10 q.d.
17. Ditropan 5 b.i.d.
18. Valium 5 b.i.d.

Would also recommend for outpatient facility PFTs and
ventilatory mechanics as an outpatient.  Please emphasize
once again that patient has had five intubations in nine
months as a pertinent point.
