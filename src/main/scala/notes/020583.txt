Chief Complaint:
Malaise, dry mouth


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arterial Line placement

History of Present Illness:
85yo M with h/o HTN, pAF not on coumadin admitted for AF with
[**First Name3 (LF) 5509**]. Patient was in USOH until 4 days ago when he began to have
dry mouth after starting a medication for BPH. He didnt stop the
medication, however, because it was allowing him to get through
the night without urinating 8 times as he had been before.
Today, however, he was feeling very dry and decided to call EMS.
In the ED his first VS were: T 98, HR 68, BP 148/113, RR 16,
O2sat 96 RA FSBS 142. He then developed tachycardia to 130-140s,
irregular. EKG showed AF. Was given 10mg IV dilt x 2 without
much effect. Got 20mg IV dilt and 30mg PO dilt and HR 95-115. BP
initially 150-> SBP 120 after dilt. Because of a mild ARF (Cr
1.8, baselie 1.3) noted on his labs he got 1L NS, and then
another one was hung before coming to the floor.

On presentation to the floor the patient had no complaints aside
from a dry mouth. He could not feel his heart beating fast, had
no chest pain or shortness of breath, did not feel dizzy and had
no nausea or abdominal pain. On dilt at home (30mg TID) for h/o
AF but not on coumadin as patient was admitted for INR of 18
this year and was deemed to not be a coumadin candidate after
this admission. He states he has been taking all of his
medications at home.
During the day of admission his heart rate was difficult to
control on IV and PO nodal blocking agents. He was persistently
tachycardic and developed increased hypoxia, wheezing and
confusion.  He was given 40mg IV lasix x 2 with minimal result
and was transferred to the CCU for further management of his AF
with [**First Name3 (LF) 5509**] and worsening CHF.
