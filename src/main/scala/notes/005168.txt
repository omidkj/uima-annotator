Pertinent Results:
[**6-8**] MRA Head: Mild narrowing of the A2 and A3 segments on the
left anterior cerebral artery as described in detail above,
possibly atherosclerotic in nature. There is no evidence of
aneurysmatic formations. The posterior circulation appears
within normal limits as well as the right internal carotid
artery.
[**6-9**] Cath: 1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 3 vessel and left main coronary artery disease.
The LMCA had a 60% ostial stenosis.  The LAD was heavily
calcified and had a 90% proximal stenosis, and 90% mid-vessel
stenosis, and diffuse distal disease.  The LCx had a 99% ostial
stenosis and heavy calcification.  The RCA had heavy
calcification and a mid-segment occlusion. 2. Resting
hemodynamics revealed normal right sided filling pressure with a
RVEDP of 8 mmHg.  Left sided filling pressure was elevated with
a mean PCWP of 18 mmHg.  Pulmonary arterial pressure was normal
at 30/16 mmHg.  Systemic arterial pressure was elevated at
167/89 mmHg.  The cardiac index was normal at 3 L/min/m2.
[**6-13**] Echo: Pre-CPB: LV systolic fxn shows an akinetic apex.
Anterior and septal walls move well, but the inferior and
lateral walls are hypokinetic.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left atrial
appendage. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Post-CPB: The patient is
on NTG, and is A-Paced. Good biventricular systolic fxn. EF now
40 - 45%. MR is 1+. Aorta intact. AI remains trace.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for concern of anterior
MI/STEMI, found to have subacute L temporal infarct on MRI
brain, also developed gout in L knee. Since the patient reported
no cardiac history nor any chest pain at the time or in the past
month, and since the data was not conclusive for an acute MI,
and in light of the ARF, the patient was medically managed for
CAD with ASA, Statin.  Beta blocker and ACE I were added as
tolerated. Patient was found to be in atrial flutter at OSH with
rate 125 and then atrial fibrillation between pm [**6-3**] to [**6-4**].
Patient came in from OSH with a Cr of 5.6 despite not reported
to have chronic renal insufficiency at baseline. As CK peaked at
1200, it is unclear if patient could have acute renal failure
that patient had rhabdomyolysis. His creatinine did trend back
down to near normal levels. Two days after admission, patient
had an acute decompensation in mental status, becoming very
agitated and confused.  Blood cultures were drawn as pt had
previously spiked a fever (although he'd been afebrile since),
and patient was started on diazepam for EtOH withdrawal. His
affect was much improved by the next day, although he was still
somewhat confused. An echocardiogram on [**2129-6-6**] showed
ant-anterolateral akinesis, left apical aneurysm, and an EF of
30%. The patient's presentation was unclear, but it is likely
that pt had an MI sometime in the few days preceding his
admission c/w downward trending cardiac markers during his
initial hospital course. In order to assess his cardiac disease,
he was thus taken for cardiac cath (unable to schedule P-MIBI),
which showed 3 vessel disease with left main disease. CT surgery
evaluated him for CABG. Patient complained of a painful L knee
on [**6-8**]. Examination revealed a warm, erythematous, tender L
knee.  As pt reported a history of multiple gouty flares and
clinical suspicion low for infection, he was started on a 3-day
course of colchicine with marked improvement by the following
day. After appropriately being medically managed from time of
admission, he was finally deemed operable and on [**6-13**] he was
brought to the operating room where he underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft x 3 and repair of LV aneurysm. Please see
operative report for details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned off sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. Beta blockers and diuretics
were initiated and his chest tubes were removed on post-op day
one. Later this day he was transferred to the telemetry f
