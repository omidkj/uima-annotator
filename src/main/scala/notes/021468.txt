Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
Right subclavian artery pseudo aa, CHF exacerbation.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
repair of right subclavian artery aa and hematoma evacuation
with right clavicular wedge resection [**2108-6-9**]


History of Present Illness:
81M LVEF 25%, mult CABG, MVR, DM, AF on coumadin, [**Hospital 78816**]
transferred from [**Hospital **] [**Hospital6 5016**] with R.SC artery
pseudoaneurysm after attempted R.SC CVL. Pt was initially
admitted to OSH with abdominal and chest discomfort. Found to
have temperature 101.7F BP 86/40. At [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **], pt was given
inhalers and one dose Rocephin, IV fluids. An attempt to enter R
subclavian vein for central line placement resulted in R
subclavian artery puncture. He was transferred here for
evacuation of pseudoaneurysm. He is s/p R sublclav exploration,
arteriotomy closure, clavicle rsxn, & hematoma evac on [**6-9**]. He
has been continued on vancomycin, flagyl and cipro from [**6-9**] to
[**6-12**] for sepsis of unclear source of infection. Urinalysis and
blood cxs are negative to date here. No leukocytosis and
afebrile here. He is being transferred to the medicine service
due to persistent O2 requirement, thought to be secondary to
congestive heart failure. His baseline weight is 170 lbs; he
currently weighs 190 lbs. He had been on 20 Lasix PO bid at
home. Received here 20 IV daily, yesterday 40 IV x2 and this AM
80 IV x1. Currently denies SOB, CP, palpitations, n/v/d,
abdominal pain, fevers, and chills.

.
R.UE U/S: [**6-8**] IMPRESSION:
2 cm pseudoaneurysm off of the right subclavian artery, within
the large hematoma in this region.
.
[**2108-6-8**]: EKG Regular ventricular pacing with ventricular ectopy.
No previous tracing available for comparison.
.
CXR [**2108-6-12**]:
IMPRESSION: Unchanged moderate bilateral pleural effusions with
stable severe cardiomegaly. No pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
Unchanged bibasilar atelectasis.
.
RUE U/S [**2108-6-13**]: IMPRESSION: Thrombus surrounding the PICC line
involving the proximal basilic and extending into the axillary
vein.
.
[**2108-6-14**]:FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-12**], there is
little overall change. Again there is enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette with bilateral pleural effusions. Some indistinctness
of pulmonary vessels suggests increased pulmonary venous
pressure. Pacemaker leads persist in this patient with midline
sternal sutures and CABG.
.
ECHO [**2108-6-14**]:The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
30-40 %). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There
is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with
right ventricular pressure overload. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis
is present. The prosthetic mitral valve leaflets are thickened.
The transmitral gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Trivial
(intravalvar) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid
valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2108-6-15**]: U/S RUQ-IMPRESSION:
1. The common bile duct has normal diameter for the patient age
.
2. Cholelithiasis with no evidence of cholecystitis.
3. Small amount of ascites and right-sided pleural effusion.
4. Moderate splenomegaly.
5. Simple cyst of the left lobe of the liver.
.
EKG [**6-17**]:Regular ventricular pacing with underlying atrial
fibrillation. Frequent ventricular ectopy. Compared to the
previous tracing ventricular ectopy is new.
.
[**2108-6-18**] Renal U/S: IMPRESSION:
1. Single right kidney, with renal cortical thinning but normal
echogenicity.
2. Multiple simple renal cysts.
.
CXR [**2108-6-24**]:FINDINGS:
Cardiomegaly and bilateral effusions are again noted. Accounting
for some positioning differences, I see no significant interval
change. Upper lungs remain clear, and the pulmonary vasculature
is unchanged.
.
all BCX: no growth.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 81yo male with LVEF 25%, mult CABG, MVR, DM,
AF on coumadin, s/p PPM, s/p evacuation of iatrogenic
pseudoaneurysm, RUE DVT-on coumadin, called out of MICU. Pt
initially transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for R subclavian pseudoaneurysm
repair, transferred to the MICU for hypotension, somnolence, and
increasing oxygen requirement. Diuresed and transferred out to
the floor.
.
1)Hypoxia: likely secondary to CHF exacerbation in the setting
of chronic co2 retention. S/p significant diuresis with lasix
gtt, stopped on [**6-22**]. Now continues to diurese on his own.
Torsemide was restarted at low doses, but became dehydrated so
was held as of [**6-25**]. Diamox was added along with torsemide for
high bicarb, but studies have shown that this does not add any
benefit in heart failure patients so it was stopped. He was
found to be [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name 6056**] breathing at night, so we have
maintained him on BiPAP 12/8 with moderate benefit. He can
continue to be maintained on CPAP 8 on the floor. He does
continue to have continued O2 requirement however, possibly due
to atelectasis vs continued volume
