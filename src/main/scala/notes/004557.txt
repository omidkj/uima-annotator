Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 96742**] was admitted to medicine after a short [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
course for a clinical picture consistent with sepsis, but with
no identifiable source. After initialy resucitation and
initation of empiric antibiotics, he remained clinically stable
and with stable mild dyspnea.

1) Sepsis (?): He was initially with high fever, rigors,
hypertension, tachycardia, mild hypoxia, elevated lactate,
leukocytosis/left shift, and wheezes on exam. He met MUST
protocol criteria and was treated as above. He had an
uncomplicated [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course and Vancomycin and gram negative
coverage were instituted. CXR, SCx, UA ,UCXR, BCXR, and liver
enzymes did not reveal the source of his illness. Given his
recent influenza infection, a repeat study was obtained, which
was negative. After transfer to the floor, he did well and was
continued on only empiric Levofloxacin. He had no more fevers or
chills.

2) Wheezes/Dyspnea: The patient was without a history of asthma
or known COPD, but had a remote smoking history. The etiology
was possibly reactive airways disease secondary to viral
infection or may have been cardiogenic in nature given his known
LE edema. However, an ECHO in [**2169**] was relatively normal with
normal EF. He was continued on Alb/Atrovent and started on
Fluticasone. He was also maintained on Furosemide PO (Home
Regimen), but as mentioned there was no pulmonary edema on CXRs.
He was discharged with Pulmonary and PFT follow-up. A chronic
lung disease was deemed likely given his elevated HCO3 since at
least [**12/2170**], obesity, previous smoking and report of chronic
dyspnea.

3) RUE Swelling: After his RIJ Catheter was removed he developed
RUE swelling without signs of an SVC syndrome. His RUE U/S of
the veins was normal. His swelling improved without
interventions.

4) HTN: His home regimen was initially held because of the
concern for impending hypotension. After stability, his
outpatient regimen was reinitiated. He was continue on Atenolol,
Captopril, and Imdur.

5) AF: Durin his acute illness, he had a few brief episodes of
AF, but this then resolved and he remained in sinus rhythm. He
was continued on beta-blocker and ASA.

6) CAD: He had known disease documented on card cath in [**2169**]:
LMCA had a 40% distal stenosis. LAD had a 50% proximal lesion.
LCx had mild disease along its length. RCA had a 60% proximal
stenosis as well as a 30% midvessel lesion. His EF in [**2169**] was
at 60%. His CEs were normal in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. He was continued on
ASA, BB, Imdur, ACE. The LDL/HDL were at 81/53. As he might have
benefited from statin given known CAD and LDL>70, his PCP was
alerted for possibly starting this medication.

7) Anemia: His baseline HCT was in the low 30s. The HCT was 37
on admission (likely hemoconcentrated) and was then stable in
low 30s. He had a microcytic anemia and mildly low iron level.
An outpatient work-up and colonoscopy was recommended.
