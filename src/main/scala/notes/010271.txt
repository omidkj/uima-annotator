History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 45 year old male with a history of aortic

valve (no history of rheumatic heart disease), "rapid heart
rate" for which he takes atenolol and 1 ppd x 15-17 years of

complaint of shortness of breath worsening over the past [**3-23**]
months. The patient initially presented to his PCP in
[**Name9 (PRE) 404**]/[**2141-3-21**] with the chief complaint of a runny
nose, clear to yellowish productive cough with blood-tinged
sputum and shortness of breath. His CXR at the time, per the
patient, was clear but he was treated empirically for a
pneumonia for a 2 week course. However, his symptoms did not
resolve. A repeat CXR was taken which showed no pneumonia but he
was treated again with Levoquin again with no improvement. Also
at this time, he noted that he was unable to lie supine at night
to sleep and thus sat upright while sleeping. In addition, he
noted increased night sweats and chills and reports a 50 pound
weight loss in the past 10 years with increased exercise but no
decreased appetite.  At baseline, the patient is able to
exercise a high degree (ie. jogs 1/2 hour with 50 pound weight
around waist, does aerobics daily). With his AS, the patient
denies any history of syncope or angina.

Around Thursday, the patient noted increased lower extremity
edema, increased orthopnea, and increased shortness of breath
and thus went to [**Hospital3 3583**] on Saturday [**2141-5-6**]. In
addition, he has noticed increased hemoptysis with now up to a
teaspoon at a time of blood in his sputum. He denies any recent
travel and had a PPD placed by his PCP that was reportedly
negative.

 At [**Hospital 26580**] hospital, he was felt to be in CHF and diuresed with
20 mg IV lasix x 2 with no effect and then 100 mg IV lasix with
900 cc out. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath, aortic
stenosis management.

ROS: Denies any chest pain, melena/hematuria. Denies any fevers
but notes night sweats and chills. Denies any palpitations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 45 year old male with a history of tobacco 1
ppd x 10-15 years, remarkable weight loss over past 10 years in
setting of exercise, nights sweats, chills, and increased
shortness of breath with bloody sputum x 2-3 months as well as
aortic stenosis with h/o bicuspid aortic valve who was
transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for management of his presumed
CHF and aortic stenosis.

Upon day of transfer, the pt steadily declined clinically, going
into cardiogenic shock.  He was taken emergently to the cardiac
cath lab where he was found to have wide open AI with
[**Hospital1 **]-ventricular dysfunction.  His EF was 15%, cardiac index of 1,
and SV02 of 24%.  He was consented on the cath table for
emergent surgery.  He went to the OR [**2141-5-9**] for emergent AVR
(25mm pericardial) and CABG x1 (SVG-PDA).  For more detailed
account, please see operative report.  Post-op, he was
transferred to the CSRU on multiple vasopressors and inotropes,
as well as an IABP.  Over the next several days, vasopressors
and IABP were weaned to off or removed, repectively.  He was
extubated on POD 2.  Chest tubes and wires were removed per
protocol over the next couple of days.  During CSRU stay, pt did
remarkably well with cardiac index from > 2.5 and SVO2 of
60-70%.  Echo on POD 5 showed an EF 20-25%.  He was transferred
to the floor on POD 5.  The remainder of his hospital stay was
unremarkable.
