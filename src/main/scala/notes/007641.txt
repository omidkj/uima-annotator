History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 50038**] is an 87 yoM NH resident with PMH of Alzheimer's
dementia and no known lung disease or smoking history who
initially presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for SOB and dyspnea after
being found with a sat of 83% at his NH on room air. Other VS
included tachycardia and a FSG of >400. At that time he
complained of N/V and by report, was incontinent of B/B, and
more confused than baseline. He was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] and
treated overnight for presumed CHF with lasix 40 mg. He was also
given a dose of levaquin for PNA. He was also found to have a
WBC of 23 and new renal insufficiency with Cr 2.4. A CK was
elevated at 2800. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 86**] for further
w/u of PNA, as well as concern for r/o MI if possible need for
cath.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS were rectal temp of 102, 126/79, 110, 96%
NRB at 10L, RR 25; appeared comfortable. Didn't sound wet on
exam, with no edema, and no obvious volume overload on CXR here.
proBNP was 3600. However, his CXR was concerning for a
retrocardiac infiltrate. Blood cultures were drawn, and they
added vanco in addition to levofloxacin b/c of his NH status and
concern for PNA. His tachycardia prompted consideration of PE,
but he could not receive a CT-A due to his poor renal function.
A V/Q scan was ordered. Was not heparinized empirically b/c he
was found to be guiaic positive. Finally, a CT head was
performed for ? altered MS, which was negative for acute bleed
or fracture.

Studies
.
[**1-15**] CXR
Left retrocardiac opacity concerning for pneumonia.
.
[**1-15**] Head CT
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.
.
[**1-18**] CXR AP AND LAT
1. New opacity right mid/upper zone--?aspiration or pneumonic
infiltrate.
2. Suspect left lower lobe infiltrate.
3. Lower lobe effusion on at least one side, ? bilateral
.
[**1-18**] Chest CT
Multifocal bilateral lung consolidation and ground glass changes
involving all lobes worse at the right apex and bases. Pneumonic
consolidations and/or aspiration events should be considered
with debris noted within the esophagus. Small bilateral pleural
effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 year-old man, nursing home resident, presenting with
health-care associated pneumonia, acute renal failure, and
hypernatremia.
.
1. Health-care associated pneumonia.
He was admitted initially to the ICU for monitoring in the
setting of pneumonia and hypernatremia.  CXR showed retrocardiac
opacity.  He was covered broadly with vancomycin, ceftazadime,
and azithromycin.  On the second hospital day, his oxygen
saturations had improved and he was transferred to the floors on
2L oxygen by nasal cannula.  Over the weekend, he was continued
on vanco/ceftaz but was noted to have increased tachypnea,
tachycardia, fevers to 101, and worsening mental status.  His
antibiotic coverage was broadened to Flagyl for anaerobes (given
concern of aspiration risk) as well as azithromycin and he was
transferred back to the intensive care unit, while in the unit
he was intubated.  His blood pressures continued to drop and he
required fluids to maintain them.  When they [**Last Name (LF) 50039**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
attempt was made to diurese the patient with lasix.  He had good
output, but remained non-responsive despite no sedation. Per the
family, a decision was made to extubate the patient.  His
breathing became agonal and 12 hours later he expired.
.
2. Acute renal failure.
He was admitted with creatinine of 3.2 up from baseline 1.2-1.4.
 His acute renal failure resolved with IV hydration.
.
3. Rule-out myocardial infarction.
He received one dose of ASA in the ED.  There was low suspicion
for ACS.  Cardiac enzymes were negative x2.
.
4. Diabetes mellitus.
He has no diagnosis of diabetes but his sugars during this
admission were elevated.  His HgA1c was 6.3.  He was kept on
insulin sliding scale.
.
5. Dementia
We continued his outpatient Namenda.
.
6. Hypernatremia.
This was believed due to hypovolemia in the setting of
overdiuresis and aggressive rehydration with normal saline.  On
transfer to the floor, he was started on D5 1/2 NS for volume
resuscitation and correction of hypernatremia.  Sodium levels
were followed every six hours to avoid overcorrection.  When his
creatinine normalized, IVF were switched to D5W at 150 cc hour.
With this treatment, his sodium gradually corrected.
.
7. Polymyalgia rheumatica.
This was not actively being treated at time of admission.
