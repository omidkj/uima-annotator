Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. was admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10 Hepatorenal service and went to IR
for placement of a temporary HD catheter ("Quinten" catheter
placed to the Rt. Subclavian vein).

He then underwent HD without complication.  He was subsequently
evaluated by IR through fistulography which confirmed a
thrombosis.  Catheters were introduced to the fistula, and a TPA
infusion was begun, necessitating ICU admission for monitoring.

He received the TPA thougout the night of [**10-7**]-7, and repeat
fistulography was performed the next day - the fistula was clear
of thrombosis.  He suffered no complication of the TPA infusion.

Otherwise, he was maintained on his usual outpatient medications
without complication or incident.

He was discharged back to [**Last Name (un) **] on [**10-9**].
