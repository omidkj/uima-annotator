Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
hyperkalemia, missed HD

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
tunneled right IJ
left AV graft

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 y.o. man with ESRD on HD, CLL, diverticulosis
and IBS, h/o RCC (s/p right nephrectomy), bladder cancer (s/p
transurethral resection) who presented to the ED for
hyperkalemia. The morning of presentation the patient was at his
regularly scheduled dialysis when it was found that his fistula
was clotted. He was not dialyzed and was sent home. Labs drawn
at that time showed K of 7.8 and thus was told to return to the
hospital. In the ED, his vitals were 98.1, 142/56, 64, 18, and
satting 90-94% on room air. He had peaked t-waves in v2-v5 of
his EKG. He was given Kayexelate 30gm, Calcium gluconate 1 gm x
2, 5 units of IV regular insulin, 1 amp of dextrose and dulcolax
suppository. A temporary femoral line was placed in the ED and
he was admitted for an emergent HD.

CXR [**2140-12-23**]
FINDINGS: Right IJ line is unchanged. There is some hazy
increased retrocardiac opacity that could represent area of
volume loss or persistent early infiltrate. This is slightly
more prominent than on the prior film. Otherwise, the lungs are
clear.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE: The patient was begun on dialysis in MICU. Surgery
attempted to remove the clot in AV fistula without success and
the fistula was converted to a graft. Patient also received
right tunnelled IJ for hemodialysis until graft maturation.
Patient recovered in MICU due to home O2 requirement. Patient
was also incidently discovered to have a positive UA and was
begun on ceftriaxone due to pt's history of allergies pending
culture data.
.
ESRD on HEMODIALYSIS/ CLOTTED FISTULA
Unable to be unclotted, was converted to a graft. A tunnelled
right IJ line was placed intraoperatively for temporary dialysis
until the graft matures. The RIJ line was noted to be kinking
frequently depending on the patient's position during dialysis
on [**2140-12-27**]. It was discussed with Renal Service, who felt
comfortable leaving it alone for now and re-assessing at next HD
session. The patient complained of nausea after dialysis on [**12-27**]
and vomited twice however his symptoms improved after
anti-emetics.
.
UTI: Although lactobacillus and alpha-hemolytic strep are
usually contaminant, since U/A was positive and U Cx showing
>100,000 ORGANISMS/ML, ceftriaxone was continued to complete a
course of 5 days.
.
CLL
Known diagnosis; CBC w diff showed high number of atypicals. The
patient had been partially treated with rituximab. See Dr [**Name (NI) 98352**] note of [**2140-11-19**] for more details. It was
deferred to outpatient treatment for management.
.
HYPOGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA
IgG of 307 (normal= [**Telephone/Fax (1) 25219**]), likely secondary to rituximab
treatment and CLL, put Mr [**Known lastname **] at risk of infection. The
patient was monitored closely for any signs of infection. Past
notes suggested reluctance to use IVIG because of concerns about
heart failure; however, it might be possible to use IVIG in
conjunction with dialysis in order to remove fluid and replace
it rather than adding to total volume.
- Patient remained afebrile throughout his hospital stay. He was
also informed to follow-up with outpatient heme re: IVIG
.
ANEMIA
The patient was on Epogen treatment at home. It was continued
(Received dose at HD on [**2140-12-27**]). Hct remained stable in low
30s.
.
PAIN s/p PROCEDURES:
It was well controlled with Percocet. The patient found the RIJ
site to be more painful than the left arm graft. The pain
improved throughout his hospital stay. He was sent home with Rx
for 30 tablets of Percocet to take with bowel regimen.
Percocet for pain following recent access procedures
.
COPD/CHRONIC HYPOXIA: on 2LNC continuous at home
- The patient initially had increased oxygen requirement to 3L
O2 NC up from basline requirement of 2L. It was likely related
to procedures with residual atelectasis and pain medications. He
was able to be weaned to 2L O2 on the floor, and maintained
saturations in low 90s at rest. It improved to mid-90s after
each dialysis. On ambulation, he would desat to mid-80s with
associated SOB. With a short rest and encouragement to take deep
breaths through the nose, the O2 sat recovered to low 90s. This
was thought to be his baseline after discussion with his
nephrologist who is very familiar with Mr. [**Known lastname **].
