Service:  Biologics

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 42-year-old male
with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma admitted
for cycle one week one of high-dose IL-2.  His oncologic
history began in [**2135-1-15**] when he developed fatigue
and by [**2135-4-14**], he had developed anemia.  CT of his
abdomen revealed a large right kidney mass.  He underwent a
right radical nephrectomy on [**2135-5-25**] revealing
adenocarcinoma with predominant clear cell type with
anaplastic spindle cell areas firm and grade 4.  There was
tumor invasion of the renal vein and metastases to the
adrenal.  Staging workup was otherwise negative.

He was followed closely and developed a cough in [**2136-4-14**].  Chest CT in [**2136-2-13**] revealed large lung nodules
consistent with renal cell metastases.  Patient was evaluated
here for high-dose IL-2 treatment program and found to meet
eligibility criteria.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
2. Bilateral inguinal hernia repairs.
3. Vasectomy.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1. Percocet prn.
2. MS Contin 30 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Multivitamin.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Reveals a well appearing
middle-age male in no acute distress.  Performance status 0.
Vital signs:  98.6, 76, 18, 113/68, and O2 saturation 98% on
room air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat:  Normocephalic
and atraumatic.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light.  Moist oral mucosa without lesions.  Neck is supple,
no JVD.  Heart:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, S1, S2.  Lungs
clear.  Abdomen is rounded, positive bowel sounds, soft.
Mild tenderness over the right nephrectomy scar area.
Extremities without edema.  Neurologic is nonfocal.

ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  WBC 5.0, hematocrit 29.3, platelet
count 332,000.  BUN 19, creatinine 1.2, sodium 142, potassium
4.1, chloride 105, CO2 30.  ALT 26, AST 13, CPK 60, alkaline
phosphatase 75, total bilirubin 0.3, albumin 3.4, calcium
8.4, phosphorus 5.1, magnesium 2.0, uric acid 6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted.  Admission weight was
noted to be 83.8 kg and he was dosed with IL-2 600,000 IU/kg
equaling 50.3 mIU IV q.8h. for 14 planned doses, [**11-27**]
scheduled doses with dose #11 held due to hypotension and
doses 13 and 14 held related to mild neurotoxicity and severe
constitutional side-effects.

His course was notable for early hypotension initially
responding to fluid boluses later requiring dopamine and
Neo-Synephrine, vasopressor support.  He was eventually
weaned from his pressors on day 11, but was noted to have a
CPK of 475 at that time.  CK MB and troponin values were also
elevated.  As per protocol, he was placed on a cardiac
monitor, and on [**3-26**] at 7 a.m., he had a run of question of
ventricular tachycardia.  He was transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit for closer monitoring.

Cardiology felt his rhythm strip was from artifact rather
than true ventricular tachycardia.  He had no acute ischemic
changes on EKG.  Echocardiogram revealed mild aortic
regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation with a left
ventricular ejection fraction slightly decreased at 50-55%.
Cardiac enzymes continued to trend downward and he remained
without any arrhythmia on telemetry.  He was felt to have an
IL-2-induced myocarditis without myocardial infarction.  He
was planned for an outpatient stress test to further evaluate
cardiac function.  He was discharged to home on [**2136-3-27**]
with a normal CPK and no cardiac symptoms.

Other side-effects during his course included fevers and
chills, and an erythematous skin rash.  He also had some
nausea and vomiting treated with antiemetic therapy.  His
hemoglobin and hematocrit on [**2136-3-21**] were 9.4 and 28.9
respectively, and he was transfused with 2 units of packed
red blood cells to help support his blood pressure.  He had a
mild thrombocytopenia with a minimum platelet count of 72,000
thought related to IL-2, which had improved to 98,000 on the
day of discharge and developed hyperbilirubinemia with a peak
bilirubin of 4.3 on [**3-24**], improved to 1.5 on [**3-24**]; mild
transaminitis with an ALT of 46 and an AST of 63 on
[**2136-3-24**] again improved before discharge.

He developed a mild metabolic acidosis with a CO2 of 19 on
[**3-24**], treated with bicarb and his maintenance IV fluids.  He
had a mild renal insufficiency with a peak creatinine of 1.8
improved to 1.1 on the day of discharge.  The side-effects
included mild diarrhea treated with antidiarrheals.

By [**2136-3-27**], he had recovered from myocarditis and other
side-effects to allow for discharge to home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with his wife.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to notify us for
fever or cardiac symptoms.  He will have an outpatient
thallium stress test performed prior to his next planned week
of IL-2 therapy.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Keflex 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. x5 days.
2. Ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. prn nausea, acid stomach, or
while on NSAIDs.
3. Lomotil two tablets p.o. q.6h. prn diarrhea.
4. Compazine 10 mg p.o. q.6h. prn nausea.
5. Ativan 1 mg q.6h. prn nausea, or anxiety, or for sleep.
6. Benadryl 25-50 mg q.6h. prn pruritus.
7. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q.4h. prn fever or pain.
8. Motrin 400 mg p.o. q.4h. prn pain.
9. Oxycodone 5-10 mg p.o. q.4h. prn pain.
10. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. prn constipation.

DIAGNOSIS:  Status post cycle one, week one high-dose IL-2
for metastatic renal cell carcinoma with course complicated
by myocarditis.
