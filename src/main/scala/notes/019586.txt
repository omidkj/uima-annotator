Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Corevalve Aortic Valve replacement via ileofemoral approach

History of Present Illness:
This 74 year old woman has severe aortic stenosis with NYHA
class III symptoms of CHF. She describes exertional dyspnea
after walking [**1-7**] blocks or if she talks for an extended period
of time. This improves when she stops to rest. She denies any
chest pain or dizziness. She also has pulmonary hypertension
which is secondary to hepatopulmonary syndrome r/t liver
cirrhosis. She has been treated with Sildenafil for several
years, with subsequent PA systolic of 50. She is also on home
oxygen 2L per nasal cannula continuously. She states that
she has been on the oxygen for close to 20 years. She has
esophageal varices grade 1 and was cleared for procedure by
gastroenterology. She was seen by liver service and was deemed
to be Childs A with espophageal varices and prohibitive for
surgical AVR. She was referred for Corevalve/TAVR trial. She has
met all inclusion criteria, with no exclusion criteria. She is
here for
elective TAVR. She reports recent episode of bronchitis for
which she was treated with 3 weeks of antibiotics and steroids
(last dose 1/16) with improvement.
.
Corevalve was successfully placed today in the OR using an
ileofemoral approach.  She is currently intubated and sedated,
stable.  Of note, pacemaker appearing to be firing
inappropriately despite HR of 70s.  Also only seeing pacemaker
spikes, not capturing, no QRS complexes.
.
Unable to obtain review of systems since the patient is
intubated. Acknowledges some mild back pain, but no other pain.

.
CHEST X-RAY ([**2143-1-28**]): The lung volumes are normal. Borderline
size of the cardiac silhouette and mild tortuosity of the
thoracic aorta. There is a moderate enlargement of the right
pulmonary artery, already documented on a CT examination from
[**2142-10-10**] and since then unchanged. No acute changes. No
pleural effusions. No pulmonary edema.
.
ECHO ([**2143-1-29**]): The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is present and appears
well-seated. The aortic gradient was not assessed. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-9-28**], a CoreValve is now
in place.
.
CHEST X-RAY ([**2143-1-29**]): As compared to the previous radiograph, a
right internal jugular catheter has been inserted. Inspiration
is improved as compared to the pre-interventional radiograph.
There is no evidence of pulmonary edema. Known enlargement of
the right hilus. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No
pleural effusions.
.
ECHO ([**2143-1-30**]): The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with borderline normal free wall function. An aortic
CoreValve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis
appears well seated, with normal transvalvular gradients. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normally functioning aortic CoreValve with mild
aortic regurgitation. Preserved left ventricular function.
Moderate-severe tricuspid regurgitation with severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the post aortic CoreValve implantation study dated
[**2143-1-29**], the CoreValve continues to be well seated. Transaortic
gradients (not assessed on the prior study) are normal.
.
ABDOMINAL X-RAY ([**2143-1-30**]): Supine views of the abdomen
demonstrate multiple air-filled loops of small and large bowel.
A single loop of jejunum in the mid-abdomen is slightly dilated
due to mild localized ileus. No evidence of obstruction.
Calcified splenic artery aneurysm is seen in the left upper
quadrant.
