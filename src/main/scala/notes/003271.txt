Allergies:
Sulfonamides / Ciprofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4232**]
Chief Complaint:
RLE cellulitis and concern for endocarditis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 60 year old male with PMH of HIV/AIDS (CD4 nadir < 100,
recent CD4 562), s/p mechanical AVR (Cardiomedics mechanical
valve) following episode of strep pneumo endocarditis ([**2100**]),
and hypertension, now presenting with redness and swelling of
the right ankle shortly after dental work without prophylaxis.
.
Patient states that he noted swelling inferior to the right
ankle on Monday, [**6-11**]. This area became more painful and swollen
over the course of the week. He also noted subjective fevers
with chills. He took ibuprofen for the pain with some relief. He
became more concerned on Thursday so presented to the ED.
.
He states that he had a dental cleaning last Thursday but did
not take antibiotics at the same time per his usual routine. He
denies any falls at home but is using a cane due to the
increased pain in the right foot with walking.
.
In the ED, intitial vitals were: T 98.7 HR 80 BP 148/72 RR 16
98% on RA. The patient had an ultrasound which showed small
fluid collections in the right leg but no DVT. He was treated
with vancomycin 1 g IV X 1 and gentamycin 80 mg IV X 1 and
received a total 2 L NS.
.
ROS: No nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, melena, BRBPR,
chest pain (pleuritic or otherwise), palpitations, dizziness or
lightheadedness change in vision, hearing, hematuria, dysuria,
numbness, tingling, weakness, joint pain, myalgias. Had a slight
headache this morning which resolved with ibuprofen. Has lost
about 10 pounds in the past few months, ascribes this to eating
less junk food. Had a high INR lately so stopped his coumadin
last weekend; resumed on Monday at 5 mg daily. Reports no recent
travel and no sick contacts.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 y/o man with HIV/AIDS, hypertension, and prior mechanical
AVR, originally admitted with right leg pain and swelling and
new murmur shortly after having dental work without antiobitc
prophylaxis.
.
1. Right Leg Cellulitis: Patient presented with a 10cm by 15cm
erythematous region which was tender to touch and palpation on
his right lower leg, surrounding his ankle, which was felt to be
consistent with a cellulitis. He remained afebrile and his WBC
was not elevated from his baseline. Fluid collections were seen
on ultrasound and confirmed with MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was examined by
ortho and it was agreed there was no evidence of a septic joint.
He was started on Doxycycline and Cephalexin. The appearance of
his leg improved significantly each day of his admission, and by
the third day he had only a trace of edema and erythema. His WBC
rose on day 3, however, to > 13 (from 11) and this raised
concern about an underlying infection. Given patient??????s history
of HIV and prosthetic aortic valve, it was felt that any
underlying fluid collection could serve as a reservoir for
infection and may pose a risk to this patient. Accordingly, the
fluid collection was drained under ultrasound on the third day
of hospitalization. The procedure was tolerated well. The
patient??????s WBC count returned to baseline the day after the
drainage. He was discharged with a home course of the same
antibiotics (Cefalexin and Doxy) and scheduled for follow up at
the [**Hospital 778**] clinic shortly after discharge.

2. New SEM Murmur: On admission the patient was found to have a
III/VI SEM which was not documented in his most recent physical
exam. Accordingly, this was felt to be a new murmur, and in the
setting of a patient with a mechanical aortic valve with a
recent history of dental work without prophylactic antibiotics
the concern for endocarditis was very high. An initial TTE was
inconclusive, but showed elevated gradient across the valve.
Given the concern, arrangements were made for a TEE, which due
to the weekend schedule involved the patient being transferred
overnight to the CCU (note that the patient was stable
throughout his hospitalization, and was not transferred to the
CCU due to clinical instability). The TEE was negative. Given
the high risk of the patient, however, it was felt that after
the current course and antibiotics are resolved, a surveillance
set of blood cultures should be performed on an outpatient
basis.

3. Anticoagulation for Prosthetic Aortic Valve: The patient was
admitted with a subtherapeutic INR after recent changes to his
daily Coumadin dose. A heparin drip was started and titrated to
ensure adequate anticoagulation. Coumadin was held pending the
patient??????s TEE, and then restarted at 3mg the night after the
procedure, and raised to his regular home dose of 5mg the day
after that. The patient??????s Coumadin was continued at 5mg but his
ritonavir, which had inadvertently been held on admission, was
restarted with the expectation that it likely boosts warfarin
effects. The patient??????s INR was 2.0 on the day of discharge,
which was considered therapeutic for his valve (therapeutic
range of 2.0 to 3.0 for newer valves, per cardiology
recommendations).

4. HIV/AIDS: CD4 Nadir < 100, most recent > 400. The patient was
continued on his ARV regimen across his hospitalization, with
the exception of his ritonavir, which was inadvertently held on
admission and then restarted on day #3. He was likely
approximately 2 days without ritonavir to boost his primary
protease inhibitor. He will continued to be followed closely as
an outpatient for his HIV care.

5. Hyperlipidemia: His outpatient statin was continued.

6. Hypertension: We continued beta blockade and the patient
remained stable and in good blood pressure control across
hospitalization.
