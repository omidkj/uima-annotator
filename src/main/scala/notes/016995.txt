Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
53 y/o M hx DMT2, HTN, hyperlipidemia presents with chest
pressure and found to have inferior STEMI.
.
He was in his usual state of health until about 1 week prior to
admission when he began to develop mild epigastric discomfort,
pain [**1-30**], lasting most of the day while at work. He works as a
construction worker during the day and cleaning at night. The
symptoms became slightly more severe on the day of admission,
and he went to see his cardiologist. Per pt, his cardiologist
did an EKG at the time and told him it was likely MSK. Then, at
8PM at night while mopping the floor, he developed severe [**11-8**]
substernal CP without radiation followed by diaphoresis,
dizziness, and nausea. He called EMS and per report, was cool,
pale, diaphoretic. HR 50, SBP 50. He received 1 mg atropine on
the field.
.
He presented to OSH with CP and bradycardia to 49 as well as
borderline low BP 103/54, RR 20. EKG with mild ST elevations in
II,III,AVF, mild ST depressions in I, AVL. He was received
plavix 600 X1, integrillin gtt, heparin gtt and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for cath.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], Pt was afebrile, HR 44, BP 105/69, RR15,
97%RA. CK 108, Trop 0.06. He was taken to cath lab, and a temp
wire was placed in lab. He was also given an additional 2 mg
atropine for bradycardia.
He was found to have:
R dominant
LMCA: normal
LAD: 30% proximal disease
RCA: total proximal occlusion
.
He underwent stenting to prox RCA lesion, 3X15 Vision stent.
Temp wire removed in cath lab.
.
Upon transfer to CCU, pt reports [**2173-1-30**] epigastric discomfort
similar to his symptoms from several days ago. He denies any
radiation, SOB, palpitations, LHD, Dizzyness. His major
complaint is dry mouth.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
On review of symptoms, + loud snoring and feeling tired during
the day. + sciatica. He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA,
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time
of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain.

Pertinent Results:
EKG demonstrated bradycardia with ectopic atrial, nl axis, nl
intervals <1mm ST elev in II, III, AVF, mild ST depressions in
I, AVL, TWI in AVF . Compared with EKG from ealrier, the changes
are now less pronounced
.
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION
COMMENTS:     1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant
system
revealed one vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically-apparent disease. The LAD had a 30% proximal
stenosis.
The LCx had no angiographically-apparent disease. The RCA had a
total
proximal occlusion.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left filling

pressures with RVEDP of 15 mmHg and mean PCW of 25 mmHg. There
was
moderate pulmonary arterial pressure with PASP of 40 mmHg. There
was
normal systemic arterial pressure with SBP of 126 mmHg and DBP
of 71
mmHg. The cardiac index was preserved at 2.5 L/min/m2.
3. Left ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful treatment of inferior STEMI with stenting of
proximal RCA
with a Vision 3x15mm bare metal stent.
5.  Prior to intervention patient had bradycardia, relative
hypotension
and strong vagal reaction necessitating use of transvenous
pacer.  After
re-establishment of flow his HR and hemodynamics improved and
the pacer
was removed at the end of the case.
6.  Succesful closure of RFA arteriotomy with 6F Angioseal
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Inferior STEMI
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
4. Moderate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
5. Successful stenting of RCA with bare metal stent.
.
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior and
inferolateral hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler
imaging suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild focal left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with overall preserved EF


Brief Hospital Course:
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was already loaded with
plavix, and on integrillin and heparin drips.  His EKG and
clinical presentation were consistent with a right-sided
myocardial infarction, as he had mild ST elevations in II, III,
and AVF with an ectopic atrial rhythm; bradycardia, and
hypotension.  He was immediately taken to the cath lab where he
was found to have total proximal RCA occlusion, with 30%
proximal LAD disease.  A bare metal stent was placed into the
RCA, and a temp wire was also place during cath.  Upon transfer
to the floor, he was bradycardic in the 50's, with stable blood
pressure. CK's peaked on [**2-2**] and began to trend down thereafter.
 A post-cath echocardiogram was obtained which showed segmental
wall motion abnormalities in distribution of his MI, with
preserved overall LV function (EF >55%).  Over the course of his
hospitalization, his heart rate improved to the 60-75 range and
he returned to his pre-hospitalization hypertensive state.  His
EKG returned to a normal sinus rhythm with Q waves in the
distribution of his MI.  We started metoprolol succinate and his
home regimen of lisinopril, high-dose atorvastatin, aspirin, and
plavix.  He was evaluated by physical therapy.
