Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
57M with ILD (?NSIP) on prednisone 20 mg daily, Afib s/p recent
ablation, CAD, OSA; transfer from OSH after admission [**2111-4-10**]
for dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis. Recent admit to OSH from
[**2111-4-7**] to [**2111-4-9**] for TEE and Afib catheter ablation. Discharged
on coumadin and lovenox until INR >2. Prior to discharge, had
small volume hemoptysis x few episodes, attributed to intubation
for procedure. On the day following discharge, patient presented
to [**Location (un) 11248**] in [**Location (un) 3844**] with c/o dyspnea and more
episodes of small volume hemoptysis. CTA was performed and was
negative for PE. Transferred to [**Hospital **] hospital (had ablation
there). CT reviewed and thought to have diffuse ground glass
opacities. Admitted to the medicine floor, continued on O2 by
simple FM with gradual increase up to 10 L/min. Continued having
hemoptysis. Given several doses of lasix. On [**4-12**] steroids
increased from home 20 mg PO pred to solumedrol 80 mg IV Q8H.
ABG today 7.41/37/73 on 10 L FM. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] given that
his pulmonologist ([**Doctor Last Name 2168**]) located here.
.
Currently continues to have both hemoptysis and dyspnea. Thinks
hemoptysis may be slightly improved, but dyspnea overall
worsening. Other ROS: + epistaxis on day of OSH admission, +
chills. Negative for fever, HA, vision changes, CP, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, constipation, vomiting/nausea, dysuria, bleeding
from other sites, weight gain, change in baseline LE edema.

[**4-13**] CXR:
There is probably a region of consolidation in the right
suprahilar lung, new since prior study. Conventional radiographs
would be more definitive. Heart size is mildly enlarged,
augmented substantially by mediastinal fat, also responsible in
part for widening of the mediastinum in the right paratracheal
region and at the thoracic inlet. Pleural effusion, if any, is
minimal. The upper esophagus is mildly distended with air.

[**4-14**] CT Chest:
Newly developed areas of ground-glass opacities in addition to
areas of chronic subpleural minimal interstitial chronic
changes. The chronic interstitial abnormalities are most likely
consistent with NSIP. The rapid
development in last two weeks of the diffuse homogeneous ground
glass
opacities in combination with severe hypoxia and radiological
appearance of the findings are highly concerning for several
possibilities: acute
exacerbation of interstitial lung disease, infection (for
example
opportunistic infection), acute interstitial pneumonia,
hypersensitivity
reaction to a new drug/[**Doctor Last Name 360**] and less likely hemorrhage.

[**4-15**] BAL:
Rare atypical group of squamous cells.
Background pulmonary macrophages, neutrophils, and red blood
cells.


Brief Hospital Course:
57M with ILD on prednisone, Afib s/p recent ablation, CAD;
transfer from OSH with dyspnea, hypoxia, and hemoptysis with
high O2 requirements.
.
# Dyspnea/hypoxia: This patient had multiple potential causes of
dyspnea including ILD/NSIP, potential cardiac causes (CHF, CAD,
Afib s/p recent ablation - potential for pulmonary vein
stenosis, ?history of PFO - potential for shunt), and pulmonary
artery hypertension.  He was also thought to have component of
chronic dyspnea unrelated to ILD, with a significant
hyperventilatory response to exercise.  Pulmonary vein stenosis
was considered in light of recent ablation, but thought by
cardiology to be unlikely after imaging pre and post ablation
was reviewed with radiology. Instead, they felt that pulmonary
contusion as sequelae of ablation was possible explanation.
.
On [**4-15**], he  began having tachypnea in the evening once BiPAP
mask applied, which progressed to tachypnea to the 50s with
oxygen desats.  He underwent urgent intubation after discussion
with him and his wife. [**Name (NI) **] then required high level of sedation
and airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) mode prior to
getting oxygen sats from mid-80s post intubation back to 90.  He
was subsequently very agitated, requiring extra sedation.  He
underwent bronchoscopy showing diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
Infectious workup from BAL was negative for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3019**], AFB,
legionella.  Vasculitis was a potential cause, and he was
started on solumedrol 1g q24h.  He was extubated successfully
shortly thereafter.  An attempt was made to diurese him, but
this was limited by blood pressure.  On [**4-24**], due to low-grade
fever and persistent copious thick secretions was started on on
empiric Vanc and Zosyn.  Mini-BAL culturs were negative.   He
continued to desaturate with movement to and from chair, but was
otherwise with O2 Sats low 90s on 5-6L NC.  Given negative blood
and sputum cultures, antibiotics were stopped. He was called out
of the ICU to the general medicine wards. He transitioned from
IV steroids to an oral prednisone taper. (60 mg x 10 days
followed by 40 mg for a total of 7 days, to be followed as an
outpatient by 20 mg daily for 7 days, and then 15 mg ongoing.)
Also, cyclophosphamide therapy was initiated (250 mg daily for 7
days followed by 150 mg ongoing). There, he continued to
desaturate with exertion and intermittently at night.  Bipap was
placed, but the patient found it uncomfortable and didn't wear
it.
.
Liver function tests were trended while on cyclophosphamide.
Prior to discharge, transaminases were mildly but stably
elevated, and TBili rose to 1.7.  These should be trended every
3 days, and the dose of cyclophosphamide reduced if needed.
.
Prior to discharge, the patient was requiring 50% venti mask to
maintain O2 Sat ~94%, with a respiratory rate in the mid 20s.
He would desaturate with exertion to the low 80s, with
respiratory rate increasing to ~35.  The patient and his family
understand that this will continue to improve as his alveolar
hemorrhage resolves and the steroids and cyclophosphamide exert
their effect on his underlying lung disease.   He will follow up
with his pulmonologist in 2 weeks.

# Hemoptysis:  On coumadin for Afib with recent a
