History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 16832**] is a [**Age over 90 **]M with a h/o 3rd degree heart block s/p dual
chamber PM ([**2154**]), CRI (Cr 1.5-1.8), DM, and CHF (likely
systolic) who initally presented 3 days prior to transfer from
home with progressive SOB, malaise, confusion and worsening LE
edema in setting of bradycardia to the high 40s at home.  He had
also been confused the last couple of days, but without
infectious sx: no fevers, cough, dysuria, headache,
lightheadness. Prior to this family states he is clear at
baseline and is not confused.  He denied CP, chest pressure but
endorsed orthopnea, LEs edema, DOE, and mild SOB at rest.  He
was recently (1mo ago) started on lasix, and despite escalating
doses, had increasing LE edema. Prior to coming to the ED on day
of admission [**2167-8-6**], pt received 40mg IV at home w/o response.
.
In the ED initial vital signs were 98.2 44 113/47 20 94% on RA.
An initial ECG showed demand V pacing and LBBB with inferior ST
elevations unchanged from baseine EKG.  Initial labs were
notable for BNP [**Numeric Identifier 16833**], creatinine of 1.8, and TnT of 0.11. A CXR
showed mild pulmonary edema. He was given ASA 325mg PO x1 and
furosimide 40mg IV x1 with no effect. He was started on a NTG
drip and given NTG SL x3 for tachypnea. He was admitted to
Cardiology for further management.
.
On the floor his SOB improved with lasix gtt, however at ~ 3am
[**2167-8-7**], pt was noted to be more somnolent and not following
commands.  ABG showed severe hypercarbia 7.34/77/144, he
received 250mg of diamox and was transferred to the MICU.
.
In the MICU, continued to be somnolent, but was able to open
eyes and moving UEs to command non-specifically.  VS were
notable for periods of apnea up to 20 seconds.  Exam notable for
holosystolic murmur at apex and diastolic m at 4LICS, peripheral
edema. Pt was started on BIPAP 10/5 for over 1 day (last bipap
[**8-7**]); diuresed 5 Liters, spent 12 hours on BIPAP Mask. Repeat
ABG showed 7.31/84/141 and echo showed improved EF of 25% up
from ~15%.  No infectious source was found. Pt improved
(although he remained moderately confused) and was transferred
to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 to finish diuresis.
.
On transfer back to the floor, VS Tc 97 BP 109/56 (94-122/37-63)
HR 64 100% on Neb w/4L NC. Pt's family was present and able to
verify information regarding baseline mental status; at baseline
pt is not confused but currently has to be regularly reminded of
location. He does state repeatedly that he wants to know why he
had fluid accumulation. Family is excellent about reminding and
reorienting pt.
.
At baseline, uses a walker, but just prior to admission needed a
wheelchair.
.
Per NF admission note: "he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative. Cardiac review of systems is
notable for absence of chest pain, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope."
