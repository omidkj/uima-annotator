Imaging:
.
[**2149-7-29**] Head CT w/o contrast
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial process.
2. Stable post-surgical changes as described above.
3. Stable left frontal lobe and left temporal lobe
encephalomalacia with
corresponding ex vacuo dilatation of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the
left lateral
ventricle, likely sequela of prior trauma.

[**2149-7-30**] Abd U/S
IMPRESSION:
1. Significant asymmetric gallbladder wall edema without
associated
gallbladder wall distention, stones or pericholecystic fluid.
Given degree of gallbladder wall edema and lack of distention,
these findings are suggestive of acute hepatitis.
2. Doppler assessment of the hepatic vasculature shows patency,
appropriate waveforms and directionality of flow.

[**2149-7-30**] CXR
FINDINGS: Low lung volumes accentuate the cardiac silhouette and

bronchovascular structures, limiting assessment of the
cardiovascular status of the patient. A questionable area of
confluent opacity has developed in the left retrocardiac region,
and could be confirmed or excluded by repeat a radiograph with
improved inspiratory level. Lungs are otherwise grossly clear,
and there is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

[**2149-8-5**] CXR
FINDINGS: Upright PA and lateral views of the chest show slight
decrease in a small right pleural effusion. Cardiomediastinal
and pulmonary structures are unremarkable. Again seen are
multiple rib fractures. No pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Slight decrease in small right pleural effusion

seizure disorder, traumatic brain injuries requiring multiple
craniotomies in [**2145**] with apparent memory deficit who was found
with a generalized seizure believed secondary to alcohol
withdrawal.

He received a loading dose of keppra in the ED. An LP was
performed in the ED found to be negative for infection, tox
screen was negative and antiseizure med levels were
undetectable. He was found to have a lactate of 12.6 which
improved with IVF, and he was started on folate, thiamine and a
multivitamin. He awoke with
