Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 562**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain, hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Subclavian TLC placement


History of Present Illness:
45 y/o male w/ a past medical history significant for HIV and
AIDS defining illnesses including PCP in the past (last CD4
count reported to be 195, vl 338,000 in [**2172-11-28**]), HCV, and
EtOH abuse presented to the ED on [**1-11**] complaining of abdominal
pain, nausea and vomiting for five days and one day of coffee
ground emesis.  He reported heavy drinking (1 gallon of vodka
per day) starting 3.5 months ago.  He was seen in the ED the day
prior to admission ([**1-10**]) for abdominal pain and found to have
elevated amylase and lipase, but the patient left AMA.  The
morning of admission, [**1-11**] the patient reports prolonged
retching after which he had coffee ground emesis (several
episodes).

ROS: denies hematemesis, BRBPR, melena, fever, chills, cough,
sob, chest pain.

In ED, the patient was given protonix IV, underwent aggressive
repletion of his electrolytes, and was started on IV
levo/flagyl. His lipase was measured at 2047, down from >5300 on
[**1-10**] measured prior to the patient leaving AMA. The patient was
initially moved to the MICU for aggressive fluid resuscitation
and electrolyte repletion. An NGT was placed for decompression,
and a TLC was placed in the left subclavian. The patient was
made NPO. An abdominal CT was performed and showed inflammation
of the head of the pancreas c/w pancreatits but no evidence of
necrosis or pseudocyst. The patient remained in the ICU for
three days and was called out to the floor on [**1-14**]. At that
point his HCT had remained stable for several days and he had
had no episodes of further coffee ground emesis and remained
guiac negative.

[**2173-1-12**] CXR
Allowing for apical lordotic projection and low lung volumes,
the heart size and mediastinal contours are within normal
limits. A nasogastric tube is present, but the distal tip is
difficult to identify due to underpenetrated technique. There is
a probable small right pleural effusion extending into the major
fissure. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.

[**2173-1-12**] Repeat CXR
Compared with earlier the same day, a left subclavian central
line has been placed -- the tip overlies the proximal SVC. No
pneumothorax is identified. An NG tube is present, tip overlying
fundus. There is p atchy atelectasis at left base, in the
setting of low lung volumes.

[**2173-1-12**] CT Abd
IMPRESSION: Acute pancreatitis, possibly with very slight
worsening of inflammatory changes in the anterior pararenal
space compared to the examination performed earlier today. A
portion of the pancreatic head demonstrates decreased
enhancement on the contrast enhanced images, which may represent
early changes of necrosis.

CT Abd pelvis [**2173-1-19**]
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of acute pancreatitis, without
evidence of new gas or fluid collections, or new areas of
necrosis.
2. Small left pleural effusion and atelectasis with resolution
of the right pleural effusion.

CXR [**2173-1-20**] IMPRESSION: Chest clear. No infiltrates. No evidence
of pneumonia

CT of Sinuses [**2173-1-21**]
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of sinusitis or mucosal
thickening involving the maxillary, sphenoid, ethmoid, or
frontal sinuses. The optic struts are bilaterally aerated. The
right cribriform plate is 1 mm superior to the left. There is
mild right-sided nasal septal deviation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of sinusitis.

ECHO [**2173-1-22**] Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Right ventricular chamber
size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal study. No echocardiographic evidence of
endocarditis

[**2173-1-24**] RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 9.2 cm, and
the left kidney measures 10.5 cm. There is no hydronephrosis,
renal masses, or renal calculi identified. No perinephric fluid
collections are seen.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis.

[**2173-1-24**] CT ABD/PELVIS IMPRESSION
1. No evidence of hemorrhage within t
