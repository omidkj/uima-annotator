Brief Hospital Course:
#Dyspnea-Following extubation in the MICU, complaint of dyspnea.
Evaluated by pulmonary and ENT; underwent laryngoscopy with no
evidence of upper airway obstruction. PE CTA obatained on [**9-16**],
and found to have segmental and subsegmental PE on CTA, as well
as multiple pulmonary nodules and R hilar adenopathy with right
main stem obstruction.  Started on heparin gtt and treatment for
COPD exacerbation (nebs, steroids, levoquin for possible
bronchitis).  ECHO c no evidence of RV dysfunction.  Pt
stabilzed and transferred to medicine on [**9-18**].  She was
transitioned off heparin onto coumadin with a lovenox bridge.
To evaluate R bronchus obstruction CT trachea with 3D
reconstruction performed and showed severe tracheobronchomalacia
with at least 80% collapsibility of the proximal trachea at the
level of the thoracic inlet and more distal collapsibility of
the right main stem bronchus.  Also showed pulmonary nodules
seen on previous CTPA.  Recommendation for follow up CT chest in
[**2-18**] months to revalute pulm nodules since pt has a smoking
history.  Pulmonary recommended f/u with interventional
pulmonology.  Pt was discharged with follow up appointment with
interventional pulmonology to evaluate tracheomalacia and
consideration of possible stenting.  On discharge pt still
complaining of substernal pain with movement and deep breathing,
with significant splinting.  This pain was secondary to trauma
sustained from MVA.  She was given oxycodone for pain control,
but was not requiring large enough ammounts of oxycodone to
start a long acting narcotic such as oxycontin.  If she is
requiring more oxycodone while at rehab, oxycontin should be
started.  No signs of PNA (normal wbc count no fevers) so
levaquin d/ced.  Pt d/ced on
.
#. Pulmonary nodules/hilar adenopathy - concern for malignancy
since pt has history of smoking.  Recommend follow-up CT Chest
in [**2-18**] months.
.
#. Anemia: Pt with hct decline from 37->34->31.6, but then
stabilized at 32.2.  Iron studies are WNL and LDH, T Bili, and
MCV WNL.  UA with blood.  Stool guaiac negative.  Urology
consulted (see below) and they felt unlikley to be GU related.
Most likely cause of drift in hct is dilutional in setting of
resolving acute renal injury.  Pt should have repeat hct drawn
at rehab on [**9-22**] and guaiac stools.
.
#. Hematuria: Urology consulted since hematuria with and they
felt unlikey that hematuria was the cause of hct drop since
small ammount of hematuria.  They attributed the hematuria to
trauma from foley in setting of treatment with plavix, aspirin,
lovenox, and coumadin.  Spoke with pt's PCP who confirmed that
pt has no coronary stents, and the plavix was started for
microvascular disease.  Plavix was discontinued to lower risk of
bleed.  Because pt also has a history of urge incontinence she
discharged with an appointment for urology follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], at which time hematuria can also be further evaluated.
.
#. UTI - UCx from [**9-16**] and [**9-14**] showed S. Aureus, but collected
while pt with foley. Follow-up urinanalysis was clean (except
blood); suspect first UCx results related to Foley use,
therefore no treatment since multiple abx allergies and seems
most likely to be [**1-17**] foley.
.
#. Acute Renal Failure - Pt had a transient bump in creatine to
1.3 likely [**1-17**] hypovolemia.  NSAIDs, Lasix, ACE and [**Last Name (un) **] where
initially held.  Creat resolved to 0.9 on discharge and home
Lasix, ACE and [**Last Name (un) **] were restarted.
