Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4691**]
Chief Complaint:
Ischemic colitis vs inflammatory colitis, LGIB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2177-5-17**]:  Extended left hemicolectomy with colostomy formation
[**2177-5-23**]:  Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
85F who presented with abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea and
leukocytosis with
elevated serum lactate. She reported that as she attempted to
get out of bed on morning of admission due to rectal bleeding
her legs "gave out" on her and she fell. She was transported to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. In the ED she was noted with
progressive tenderness over the course of her resuscitation, and
a lactate that originally went down, but then was noted to
increase. CT imaging was done showing an area of colitis most
prominent in the
area of the splenic flexure. She became intermittently
hypotensive, requiring significant fluid administration to
maintain normotension, and showed signs of
progressive abdominal tenderness.  She was, therefore, taken to
the operating room for exploration and definitive management.

On POD 3, Mrs. [**Known lastname 74659**], had episode of SVT with rates of
approximately 150-170, and per her report, was symptomatic with
palpitations, chest discomfort and shortness of breath.  The SVT
spontaneously broke without intervention. EKG
was performed overnight after the SVT broke which showed a rate
of ~100 in sinus rhythm with diffuse ST depressions in
I/II/AVF/V4-V6 and 1mm elevation in aVR which is all new from
baseline. No intervention was done at that time. Subsequent EKGs
showed resolution of most of these changes with subtle ST
depressions in the anterolateral precordial leads. Afterwards
she was noted to
have increasing O2 requirements and CXR this AM was consistent
with pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.  She was
diuresed with 10mg IV lasix x1 with improvement in her shortness
of breath.  Subsequent labs were notable for CK 489, MB 4,
Trop-T 0.28 with BNP ~22,000.  The patient was admitted to ICU
for further management and closer observation.

On [**2177-5-22**], a cardiac catheterization was completed and
significant for distal left main and 3-vessel coronary artery
disease.  Please see the catheterization report for further
details.

Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild to moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal severe
hypokinesis of the entire septum and basal-to-mid anterior wall.
The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35-40 %). The
estimated cardiac index is borderline low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation.

[**2177-5-21**] ECG:
Sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats. Low limb lead
voltage.
ST-T wave abnormalities. Consider ischemia. Since the previous
tracing
of [**2177-5-16**] the rate is faster, the ventricular premature beat is
new, atrial premature beat is new, limb lead voltage is lower,
ST-T wave abnormalities are new. Consider ischemia. Clinical
correlation is suggested.

[**2177-5-21**] Chest x-ray:
AP chest compared to [**5-20**]:

Lung volumes are appreciably lower, and there is considerably
more
consolidation in both lower lobes as well as mediastinal and
pulmonary
vascular congestion and perihilar opacification suggesting
concurrent
pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
presumed, increased since [**5-20**].  Heart size is normal.  Right
internal jugular line ends in the region of the superior
cavoatrial junction.

[**2177-5-22**] Cardiac cath:

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Ostial and complex distal LMCA and severe 3 vessel coronary
artery
disease.
2. Mild systemic arterial hypertension.
3. Moderate left ventricular diastolic heart failure in the
setting of
know left ventricular systolic heart failure (presumed acute).
4. Reinforce secondary preventative measures against CAD, MI, LV

systolic dysfunction, and hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 74659**] was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery team and was
taken to the operating room for extended left colectomy with
transverse colostomy. In the OR she received 4.5L crystalloid
and one unit of cryoprecipitate for a fibrinogen in the 80s and
a slow ooze  noted intraoperatively. IV Cipro and Flagyl along
with Vancomycin via the stoma were started. Postoperatively she
was hemodynamically stable and was admitted to the TSICU where
she remained intubated. Over the course of the day her ABG
showed a persistent metabolic acidosis which was felt to be
secondary to under resuscitation and she was bolused and her
basal fluid rate was increased to 125/hr to good effect, her
ABGs improved.

She was also seen by Orthopedics for her left wrist fracture
that was sustained during her fall at home which was what
initially brought her into the hospital. This was reduced and
splinted in the ED prior to her trip to the OR. She will follow
up in [**Hospital 5498**] clinic in a few weeks after discharge.
