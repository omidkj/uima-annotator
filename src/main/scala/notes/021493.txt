Allergies:
Lisinopril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea, acute renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes with repositioning


History of Present Illness:
70yoF with h/o DM2, HTN, L iliac artery stenosis s/p stent who
presented with DOE and exertional chest tightness x1 wk.
.
She saw her PCP today where she c/o new onset exertional chest
tightness [**7-19**] associated with neck pain. Also complaining of
DOE which was also new and has been progressively worsening as
well. She denied diaphoresis, nausea/vomiting, arm / jaw pain.
Her vitals were significant for BP 179/88, p105, 100% RA NC.
There was concern for new TWI's laterally, and sent to ED.
.
In the ED: 99.2 98 170/88 18 100% on RA. She denied chest pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, black or bloody stools. She was
initially well appearing and exam was reportedly non-focal
initially, with clear lungs, RRR, no edema. Labs showed Trop
0.03, ARF with BUN/Cr 64/7.2 (up from Cr 1.4-1.7 baseline), HCO3
20, and K 5.7. EKG concerning for lateral strain pattern STD's
with concomitant R precordial J point elevation. Renal
consulted; CCU fellow and Atrius Cards notified.
.
In the ED, she became acutely dyspneic, tachypneic to 30-40's,
and satting mid 80% on RA. Exam showed diffuse crackles and
increased WOB; she was placed on NRB and given a trial of
albuterol inhaler without much effect. Her BP was noted to be
200/100 and there was concern for flash pulmonary edema vs PE vs
COPD/asthma. An EJ PIV was placed. CXR showed pulmonary edema.
She was given SL NTG then started on Nitro gtt, and given 40 mg
IV Lasix x1. BP's improved, then hypoTN to 70/40's and gtt
stopped, then restarted when BP's went up to 180/100's; goal SBP
120's. Unable to place arterial line. She was also given 325
ASA.
.
Vitals before transfer: 97.4 p100 150/87 100% on 4L NC.
Currently on Nitro 0.5 mcg/kg/min, and looking much better.
.
Review of Atrius records shows that she is followed by Atrius
Oncologist [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 349**]. Per his most recent notes, she was
seen in [**6-/2152**] and per his note: "anemia, small IgG lambda
monoclonal protein, elevated light chains, elevated Beta 2
Microglobulin, transient mild hypercalcemia suggest either an
MGUS, an early MM, or a low-grade lymphoma. Bone marrow biopsy
was non-diagnostic." However, there was question whether these
were due to the venous obstruction in her iliacs or an evolving
lymphoproliferative disorder. Her kidney function was
deteriorating as early as [**4-/2152**]; per Atrius records:
Cr [**11/2151**]: 0.83
[**12/2151**]: 0.95
[**4-/2152**]: 1.67
[**4-/2152**]: 1.44
[**6-/2152**]: 1.72
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
