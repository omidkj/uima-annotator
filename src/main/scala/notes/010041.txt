Service:  Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old
gentleman with a history of CAD, who, on [**2136-11-22**],
underwent microvascular decompression for trigeminal
neuralgia.  Preoperatively, he was found to be in atrial
flutter and underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed
clear coronaries.

On [**2136-11-28**], he was loaded on Heparin and admitted for
cardioversion.  He had a negative TEE and converted to normal
sinus rhythm.  He was placed on Amiodarone.  He was
discharged on Lovenox and Coumadin after cardioversion.

On [**2136-11-29**], in the morning, he complained of sudden onset
of severe headache, followed by nausea, vomiting, and
vertical diplopia.  In the emergency room, he developed sinus
bradycardia with ventricular escape beats, and he was given
Atropine.  He was brought into a normal sinus rhythm.  He
became disoriented with a severe headache.  Head CT showed
acute posterior fossa subarachnoid hemorrhage with fourth
ventricle obstruction.

On examination, the blood pressure as 240/120, heart rate was
down to 12.  He was sleep.  He only responded to vigorous
stimulation.  He would fall back to sleep easily, withdraw on
all four extremities.  Pupils were 5-mm and minimally
reactive bilaterally.  He had a positive gag.  Face was
symmetrical.  He was not moving any extremities, but to pain.
His eyes were closed.  He was hyperreflexic on the left.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History included CAD and status post
CABG.  He also had prosthetic valve placed and trigeminal
neuralgia decompression.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission revealed the following:
White count 7.5, hematocrit 40.7, platelet count 260,000, PT
14.4, PTT 35.1, INR 1.4.  The patient was admitted to the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit and a ventricular drain was
placed.  The patient was monitored closely.

The Department of Cariology saw the patient in the Intensive
Care Unit and recommended holding all beta blockers and
restarting the Amiodarone.  The patient remained intubated
and sedation for two days.  On [**2136-12-2**], all sedation was
discontinued and the patient was showing some signs of
improvement.  Pupils were 3-mm down to 2 -mm and briskly
reactive.  The patient was following simple commands, showing
two fingers.  The patient had repeat head CT on [**2136-12-2**],
which showed no change in the fourth ventricle.  The patient
had an episode of hypoxia on [**2136-12-3**].  The patient had a
CT angiogram, which was negative for PE.

The patient had spiked a temperature on [**2136-12-4**] and was
started on Levofloxacin for gram-negative rods, sputum
culture.  The patient continued to be followed by the
Cardiology Service.  The patient went back into atrial
fibrillation.  The Department of Cardiology recommended
electrocoagulation, which was done.  The patient converted to
normal sinus rhythm and has remained in normal sinus rhythm
to date.  The patient was extubated on [**2136-12-10**] and
tolerated that well.  He was awake, alert, oriented,
following commands, moving all extremities strongly.  He was
transferred to the regular floor on [**2136-12-12**].  He had a
swallow evaluation, which he failed.  He had a G tube placed.
Vital signs have remained stable.  He has been afebrile.  He
finished a 10-day course of Levofloxacin for Klebsiella
pneumonia.  He current is afebrile.  He was seen by physical
therapy and Occupational Therapy and found to require
rehabilitation prior to discharge home.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Prevacid 30 mg per NG tube q.12h.
2.  Levofloxacin discontinued.
3.  Captopril 25 mg per NG tube q.8h.
4.  Nystatin swish and swallow 5 cc q.6h.
5.  Celebrex 200 mg per NG tube q.day.
6.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o.b.i.d.
7.  Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. NG tube b.i.d.
8.  Tums 500 mg per NG tube b.i.d.
9.  Tylenol 650 q.4.h. p.r.n.
