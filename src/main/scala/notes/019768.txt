HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70-year-old male
who was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer in [**2135**], and at
that time was found to have disease in the lymph nodes which
was deemed to be inoperable.  He therefore underwent
chemotherapy and radiation therapy, with his last treatment
in [**2137**].  He had been doing well since then but was found to
have a pulmonary nodule in late [**2143-9-21**] on follow-up
imaging.  His repeat computer tomography at that time
suggested possible enlargement of the nodule.  He therefore
presented for resection of the nodule in order to determine
its etiology.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  He was afebrile at 97.8
degrees Fahrenheit, his pulse was 113, his blood pressure was
146/85, and he was otherwise saturating 97 percent on room
air.  He was in no acute distress.  He had no scleral
icterus.  He had no cervical adenopathy.  The carotids were 2
plus.  The lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion
bilaterally; although the breath sounds were distant.  He had
no crackles or wheezes.  Heart was otherwise regular and
without rubs.  The abdomen was soft.  There was no evidence
of hepatosplenomegaly or ascites.  He had no inguinal
adenopathy, and otherwise no peripheral edema.

PREOPERATIVE LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  His preoperative
hematocrit was 44.5.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2144-5-29**] and on that day underwent a right video-assisted
thoracic surgery with wedge resection without note of
intraoperative complications or excessive blood loss.  It was
noted that he was somewhat hypotensive intraoperatively, but
this was felt by the Anesthesia Department to be secondary to
his anesthesia.  He was not extubated in the Operating Room
secondary to a slow recovery time from anesthesia.  The
patient was taken to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit intubated.

While in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, the patient became
somewhat more alert and oriented, and it was felt at that
time that he was safe extubation.  Shortly after he was
extubated, the patient became acutely tachycardic and
somewhat hypotensive with a mean arterial pressure in the 50s
and with a decreasing oxygen saturation.  Therefore, he was
re-intubated and an echocardiogram was performed in the Post
Anesthesia Care Unit to rule out any sort of cardiac
dysfunction.  This showed an ejection fraction of greater
than 50 percent.  No significant valvular disease, and no
evidence of a hyperdynamic stated indicating that there was
poor filling.  His hematocrit was otherwise stable, and his
chest tube output was normal.  It was felt that the
hypotension was again secondary to anesthesia.  The patient
was started on a Neo-Synephrine drip for pressor support.

Later that night, he was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery
Recovery Unit for more intensive monitoring.  He was
extubated on postoperative day one and did fine weaning from
oxygen throughout the rest of his hospitalization.  Notably,
on postoperative day two he did have collapse of his right
lower lobe on chest x-ray; but with aggressive chest physical
therapy, coughing, and deep breathing exercises he was re-
expanded.  He did not need any sort of bronchoscopy.

Otherwise, in terms of his Intensive Care Unit stay, his
Intensive Care Unit stay was prolonged secondary for a need
for blood pressure support on Neo-Synephrine which was
weaned, and the Neo-Synephrine was discontinued on
postoperative day three.  He did remain slightly tachycardic,
but this was felt to be close to his baseline; as per his
preoperative numbers.  Otherwise, the patient was eating
well.  His chest tubes came out on postoperative day two, and
he had no evidence of a significant pneumothorax, and his
chest x-ray otherwise looked fine.

DISCHARGE CONDITION/DISPOSITION:  It was felt that by
postoperative day four - as the patient was up and
ambulating, had excellent pain control with oral pain
medications, and was taking adequate oral intake, and was
otherwise saturating well with a minimal oxygen requirement -
that he could be discharged home in good condition.  He was
discharged to home with his prior hematocrit prior to
discharge being 33.  Otherwise, his blood urea nitrogen and
creatinine were 25 and 1.  His pathology was still pending at
the time of discharge.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Percocet one to two tablets by mouth q.4-6h. as needed
   (for pain).
2. Tylenol 325 mg by mouth q.6h. as needed (when not taking
   Percocet).
3. Ibuprofen 600 mg by mouth q.6h. (for seven days).

Otherwise, he was told he could continue his aspirin per day,
a multivitamin, and Pepcid.  He was advised not to take
aspirin while taking ibuprofen.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was instructed to follow
up with his oncologist and his primary care physician within
the next 10 to 14 days.  He was to see Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 175**] in
one week.
