Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2123-4-14**] Aortic Valve Replacement (21 CE Magna Pericardial)

History of Present Illness:
72 year old man has a history of aortic stenosis,hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, diabetes. He initially felt exertional dyspnea
while walking fast started about 1 year ago. He attributed his
shortness of breath to being overweight. He lost some weight and
his shortness of breath improved, however he continued to feel
exertional dyspnea with activity. In addition, he presently
notes occasional lightheadedness as well as some mild chest
discomfort at rest. He denies palpitations,claudication, edema,
orthopnea, PND. Based on the the patient worsening aortic
stenosis seen on echo noted below, he is now referred for a
cardiac catheterization and possible surgical evaluation.

Pertinent Results:
[**2123-4-14**] Intraop TEE [**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
PRE-CPB: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic dissection is
seen. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

POST-CPB:
There is a bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. The valve
is well-seated, the leaflets are normally mobile, and there is
no paravalvular leak. The peak gradient across the aortic valve
is 24mmHg, the mean gradient is 11mmHg with a CO of 4.8.The LV
chamber size is small, consistent with hypovolemic state. The LV
systolic function appears normal, the estimated EF>55%. The RV
size and function appear normal. There is no evidence of aortic
dissection.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 90328**] was a same day admit and on [**2123-4-14**] he was brought to
the operating room where he underwent an aortic valve
replacement (Aortic Valve Replacement #21 CE Magna
Pericardial)with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery, he was transferred to the
CVICU intubated and sedated. Within 24 hours he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated without
incident. He was weaned off pressors and on post-op day one he
was resumed on beta-blockers/statins/aspirin. Chest tubes and
epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. He was
transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring. He
developed postop atrial fibrillation. Beta blockade was advanced
for rate control and he was started on Coumadin. INR was
monitored daily and Coumadin was dosed for a goal INR between
2.0 and 3.0. Amiodarone was initially loaded but discontinued
due to several pauses(all less than three seconds) as
recommended by the [**Location (un) 2274**] cardiology service. There was no
indication for pacemaker or any other antiarrhythmic at this
time. Due to volume overload, he required several days of
aggressive diuresis. Renal function remained stable. He
continued to make clinical improvements and was eventually
cleared for discharge to rehab([**Hospital 66**] Rehab and Nursing
Center) on postoperative day six. Following discharge, he will
followup with [**Location (un) 2274**] cardiology in approximately one month. If he
remains in atrial fibrillation at that time, he will be
evaluated for possible cardioversion. Following discharge from
rehab, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 32467**] has agreed to monitor Coumadin as an
outpatient. Prior to discharge, all appointments have been
confirmed.
