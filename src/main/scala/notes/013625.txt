Admission Date:  [**2198-9-26**]       Discharge Date:  [**2198-10-5**]

Date of Birth:   [**2122-4-3**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Urology
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
gentleman with a history of diabetes for 63 years,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, who on work-up for
hematuria had a suspicious cytology and was found  to have a
filling defect in the upper pole of the right kidney by
retrograde pyelogram.  The brush biopsy of the right renal lesion
was
suspicious for transitional cell carcinoma. After consideration
of conservative options, a decision was made by patient and
surgeon to proceed with a right nephrourterectomy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for insulin dependent
diabetes for more than 40 years, managed in the [**Last Name (un) **] Diabetes
Status post open reduction and internal fixation in [**2198**],
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q day, Cardia 120 mg
q day, Aspirin 81 mg q day, Pravachol and Insulin.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He denied any history of chest pain,
shortness of breath, or weakness.  Most recent stress test
was normal.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  During admission showed a well
appearing overweight white gentleman in no acute distress.
He is afebrile.  Blood pressure is 175/79 and heart rate is
73.  He weighs approximately 190 lbs.  His pupils are round,
equal, reactive to light and extraocular movements are
intact.  His neck is supple, no lymphadenopathy, no carotid
bruits.  His chest is clear bilaterally to auscultation.
Heart has a regular rate and rhythm, no extra heart sounds,
no murmurs.  The abdomen is distended and somewhat firm with
active bowel sounds.  There is no palpable mass, no
hepatosplenomegaly.  Rectal exam showed normal tone.  The
prostate feels smooth, there is no rectal mass, guaiac
negative.  Extremities are well perfused with no obvious
edema.  Pre-operative laboratory work showed a hematocrit of
39.7 and a stress test showed no reversible ischemia and
ejection fraction was 66%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2198-9-26**] the patient was brought to the
OR for a scheduled right sided nephroureterectomy.  The
operation was complicated by excessive bleeding with
estimated blood loss of 3,500 cc.  The patient received 10
liters of crystalloids during the operation.  Postoperatively
he was moved to Intensive Care Unit for better management of
the fluid status and his blood pressure.  The patient was
extubated on postoperative day #1 without complications.
While in the Intensive Care Unit he remained hypertensive.
That required nitro drip to obtain adequate control.  At the
same time he also suffered from low urine output.  He
required multiple doses of IV fluid bolus.  However, he
responded to IV doses of Lasix for diuresis.  His creatinine
stabilized at level of 2.1 to 2.4 from his baseline of 1.6.
Renal consult was obtained and the decreasing renal function
was felt to be due to the transient hypoperfusion during the
operation when his blood pressure was dropped to low 100's
for approximately an hour.  The patient's stay in the MICU
was otherwise uneventful.  He was then transferred back to
the floor on postoperative day #3.  On the evening when he
transferred to the floor, he experienced an episode of atrial
fibrillation with rapid rate of around 160 times per minute
and there were associated ischemic changes seen in the EKG.
He required several doses of IV Lopressor and IV Diltiazem to
slow down his heart rate and convert it back to sinus rhythm.
A cardiac enzyme was sent and chest x-ray was also obtained.
He was then transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit for
continuous IV infusion of Diltiazem to control his heart
rate.  His heart rhythm converted to sinus rhythm a few hours
after the IV Diltiazem instillation.  He remained to be
stable for the MICU stay.  The etiology of this episode of
atrial fibrillation without prior history remained unclear,
however, it was thought that his status of fluid overload may
contribute to the cause.  On postoperative day #6 the patient
was then transferred back to the floor in stable condition.
He started to pass gas and diet was slowly restarted.  On the
day of discharge he tolerated a full diet without any
problems.  His central line and Foley catheter was
discontinued on postoperative day #8.  He required a minimum
amount of pain medication and made good amount of urine.  His
laboratory studies including CBC and electrolytes remained
unchanged until the day of discharge.  His creatinine level
is 2.4 on the day of discharge.

During this hospital stay the patient had very limited amount
of physical activity.  He feels weak in general and could not
ambulate without significant help.  He has pre-existing diabetic
neuropathy.   Therefore, he is arranged
to be discharged to a rehab facility to help ambulating and
regain his capacity of maintaining daily home activity.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q day, NPH
insulin 10 units in the morning, 6 units in the evening,
insulin sliding scale with regular insulin, Lopressor 25 mg
[**Hospital1 **], Percocet [**2-14**] po q 4-6 hours as needed and Diltiazem long
release 240 mg every morning.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehab facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Transitional cell carcinoma of the right kidney

Complications:
1. Operative blood loss
2. Postoperative renal insufficiency
3. Postoperative Atrial fibrillation
