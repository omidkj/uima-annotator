No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium or left
atrial appendage. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial
septum is seen
at rest. A secundum type atrial septal defect is present. Left
ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately
dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with
severe septal, apical, and mid to lateral anterior and
anterolateral
hypokinesis/akinesis. The inferior, lateral and inferolateral
walls are
moserately hypokinetic in the basal to mid segement but are
severely depressed
apically. The ejection fraction is in the 15-20% range. An
apical left
ventricular thrombus is not seen but can not be completely ruled
out. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta
is moderately dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch.
The descending thoracic aorta is moderately dilated and sverely
tortuous.
Spontaneous echo contrast, indicative of decreased blood flow,
is seen in the
descending thoracic aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in
the descending
thoracic aorta. The wall of the descending aorta is quite thick
- this may be
complex atheroma but an intramural hematoma or an old dissection
can not be
completely ruled out. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is
seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

After completion of bypass grafting, the right ventricle
continues to display
normal function. The focal abnormalities in the left ventricle
persist. The
function of the lateral, inferior, and inferolateral walls is
slightly
improved. The ejection fraction is around 20%. No other change
from pre-CPB
findings.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted for recurrent angina on [**8-11**] and heparin started.
Further eval. revealed a calcified aorta on chest CT. Eight beat
run of NSVT on [**8-14**]. OPCABG x4 performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**8-15**].
Transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on phenylephrine and
propofol drips. Extubated on the morning of POD #2 and pacer
interrogated by EP service. Transferred to the floor on POD #3
to begin increasing his activity level. Went into A fib and oral
amiodarone started. Gentle diuresis continued. Pacing wires and
chest tubes removed without incident. He continued to refuse to
take any medication. He had an 8 beat run of VTach and was seen
by electrophysiology given his EF of 15%. He will follow up as
an outpatient. He was also seen by psychiatry, after which he
agreed to take some of his cardiac medication. He was ready for
discharge to rehab on [**8-23**].
