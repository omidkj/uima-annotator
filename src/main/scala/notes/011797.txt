Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
weight gain, dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 yoF with DMT1, atrial pacemaker, ischemic CM,
CKD and several admission over the last several months for CHF,
delirium and aspiration pneumonia. She has been at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab
since her discharge on [**2118-4-4**]. She is on spironlactone but has
had her lasix held in the setting of worsening renal function
over the last few weeks; her renal function has started to
improve though is very sensitive to lasix boluses received at
HR. Over the last few weeks, she has had increasing weight [**Last Name (un) **]
and her husband reports that she is nearly 50 pounds above her
baseline weight. Problems included [**Name2 (NI) 4171**] renal dysfunction and low
albumin as contributing to inability to diurese, and she has
actually accumulated an additional 10 pounds of fluid, even
after initiation of aldactone. She is a direct admission to the
floor from HR.

On ROS, she endorses dyspnea and SOB even at rest but especially
with rolling; she has had limited mobility due to the anasarca
and DOE; has a non-productive cough, PND; denies fever, sputum,
myalgias, HA, and anorexia.

In terms of her recent admissions, from [**2-22**] to [**2118-3-11**] she was
admitted with CHF exacerbation and delirium thought ot be
secondary to med effect (after being at an OSH for several weeks
prior to that). She has been off and on [**Month/Day/Year **], and she is
currently taking [**Month/Day/Year **] 2.5 mg QHS, which her husband feels she
absolutely needs. That admission was complicated by torsades
requiring shocks. She was delirious and combative for several
weeks before it was ultimately decided to make her CMO. However,
she was transferred here and treated by taking her off several
medications, and her mental status improved, requiring only
[**Month/Day/Year 7130**]. She was discharged to home ~40 pounds above her dry
weight, with a plan to manage her as an outpatient. She has
profound diastolic dysfunction and not much in the way of
systolic dysfunction (likely combination of ischemia, scar,
diabetes). For her delirium, she was also doing very well, and
her [**Month/Day/Year 7130**] was discontinued, and her mental status has
apparently also decompensated. On the admission from [**2118-3-28**] to
[**2118-4-4**], she was treated for pnuemonia.

Past Medical History:
Cardiac Risk Factors: Diabetes, CKD
Cardiac History:
- CAD s/p anterior MI, multiple PCIs and history of left main
thrombosis during last cath in [**3-/2112**]; with thrombotic event
developed 10 minute asystolic arrest. Since then she has had
positive stress test, not deemed to be intervened upon due to
high risk.
- Ischemic CHF with most recent known EF 20-25% in [**Month (only) 1096**]
[**2117**].
- VT s/p ICD (hx torsades) placed [**2-13**]
- PVD s/p fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass.
.
Other Past History:
- DM type I
- CKD - baseline creatinine 2.5-3
- Legally blind due to diabetic retinopathy
- Anoxic brain injury resulting from PEA arrest in cath as
above.
- Memory and word finding difficulties of unclear etiology; has

been evaluated by neurology and cognitive neurology.
- Diabetic neuropathy
- Hypothyroidism
- Anxiety
- Depression
- s/p carpal tunnel surgery
- ?severe pulmonary hypertension

Social History:
She has one son. She finished a bachelor's degree in college, is
married, and lives with her husband who is very involved in her
care. She is a nonsmoker and does not drink any alcohol. At
baseline uses a walker as a result of her diabetic neuropathy
and can get around the house on her own.

Family History:
Her mother died at 50 of heart-related illness

==============================
IMAGING:

CXR ([**2118-4-21**]) - IMPRESSION: Worsened pulmonary edema with left
lower lobe opacity may represent pneumonia.

CXR ([**2118-4-25**]) - FINDINGS: Widespread bilateral airspace
opacities have slightly progressed since the recent radiograph.
Appearance of the chest is otherwise similar to the recent study
except for repositioning of a Swan-Ganz catheter, now
terminating in the right ventricular outflow tract. Other
indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard
position.

Echo ([**2118-4-22**]) - The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with borderline normal free wall function. [Intrinsic
right ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mit
