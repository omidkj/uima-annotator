Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3561**]
Chief Complaint:
Cardiac Arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 65 yo female with a history of CAD s/p CABG, CHF (EF
of 55% with basal inferior hypokinesis), pulmonary HTN, Stage IV
CKD, DM and hypothyroidism who had a syncopal episode c/w
asystolic cardiac arrest. Apparently earlier today the patient
began to c/o dizziness and midscapular pain. She the fell to the
ground. The patient was found down after 8-10 minutes in
asystole and was administered epi/atropine x4 by EMS with return
of pulse and blood pressure. Initially the patient was
transferred to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1459**] Hospital and did not require
pressors until arrival there. She was started on dopamine there
at 4 and was intubated. The pt was then transferred to our ED.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her vitals were HR 50s-80s, BP 90s-160/50s-60she
was found to have pupils 5mm NR, unresponsive without sedation,
and EKG with lateral deep ST depressions. CT of the head
revealed no ICH or mass effect. The patient was found to have a
K of 6.2 and was treated with 1 amp of Na HCO3, 1 amp Ca
gluconate, 10 U of insulin with D50, kayexalate 30 gm x1.

Pertinent Results:
Echocardiogram on [**2177-2-5**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is [**3-27**]  mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity  size and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion  is normal.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with focal
hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly  thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral  regurgitation. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be quantified.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of  [**2175-6-30**], right ventricular cavity enlargement
and regional dysfunction is  now identified and left ventricular
systolic function now appears normal.  Is there a history to
suggest right ventricular ischemia or ARVC?  If clinically
indicated, a cardiac MRI ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 9559**]) may be able to clarify
RV pathology.

Head CT on [**2177-2-5**]:
HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is no comparison.  There is no
acute
intracranial hemorrhage.  There is no shift of normally midline
structures or ventricular dilatation.  There is poor
differentiation of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter which could be due to
technique or due to mild diffuse brain edema. There is small
amount of fluid in the nasopharynx. Mucosal thickening is seen
in the ethmoid sinus. Cerumen is noted in the left external
auditory canal.  The surrounding skeletal structure is
unremarkable. The evaluation of the skull base is limited.
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage.  ? diffuse brain
edema. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was informed.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 65 yo F with a history of CAD s/p CABG, CHF (EF of 55%
with basal inferior hypokinesis), pulmonary HTN, Stage IV CKD,
DM and hypothyroidism who had a syncopal episode c/w cardiac
arrest.
.
#Asystolic Cardiac Arrest: The precipitant of the cardiac arrest
is unclear, but likely related to an MI. Etiologies include
hyperkalemia, MI, drug O/D, PE, tamponade. Serum tox was
negative, and BP is stable off pressors so a massive PE or
tamponade is unlikely as well.  Intubated for unresponsiveness
.
# Neuro: Pt had lost meaningful neurologic function at this
time. She has no pupillary/oculocephalic/corneal reflexes,
indicating very poor prognosis. GCS is 3 at this time. She has
evidence of anoxic brain injury on imaging. She also appears to
have an ?epidural hematoma vs. artifact on CT of the C spine,
for which its contribution to her presentation is unclear.
Started dexamethasone 4.  EEG ordered to eval for brain
activity.  Neurology consulted:

"Recent AAN guidelines suggest that the most specific indicators
of prognosis are absent pupillary light response, absent corneal
reflexes, extensor or worse motor response to pain, myoclonus
status epilepticus, elevated serum neuron-specific enolase, and
absent somatosensory evoked potential studies (Wijdicks, et [**Doctor Last Name **],
Neurology [**2175**];67:203-210). Of the above, the pt demonstrates
absent pupillary light response, absent corneal reflexes absent
motor response to pain. NSE assay takes roughly 14 days to
return, and is not practical. Neuroimaging findings are also
useful adjuncts, however, and CT yesterday already demonstrated
loss of grey-white differentiation throughout. The neurologic
examination three days after the event has been demonstrated to
be a reliable indicator of prognosis, however the literature
supports the notion that patients with absent brainstem reflexes
at any time after the event have relatively poor prognosis with
low likelihood of returning to a high functional status. "
Organ bank notified.  Care was withdrawn and patient expired at
4:30PM.
.
#Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/Acidemia: Likely related to
altered mental status. PCO2 was 72 with pH of 7.11 and bicarb of
22 indicating a primary respiratory acidosis.  Hyperventilated
pt given brain anoxic injury
.
#Elevated cardiac enzymes: The patient likey has elevated
enzymes secondary to defibrillation as well as possible ACS. Her
troponin is also elevated in the setting of renal failure. EKG
on admission revealed lateral ST depressions. She likely has at
least an element of demand in the setting of known CAD and
hypotension.
.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's Cr is 3.1, with
BL of 2.2-2.8. The patient's renal insufficiency is unlikely to
account for the hyperkalemia as her creatinine is not far from
baseline.
.
#Hyperkalemia: Likely secondary to respiratory acidosis as well
as renal failure. Treated with bicarb, kayexalate, calcium
gluconate, insulin in ED, as well as one more amp of bicarb in
ICU.
.
# DM: The patient has known DM with glucose levels in the
300s-400s.

#Hypothyroidism:
