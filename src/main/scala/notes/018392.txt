Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59 year old man
with a history of stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung, who
originally presented with a neck mass in [**2102-8-8**] and was
found to have stage IV lung cancer with metastases to his
left neck and subcarinal lymph nodes, status post a right
upper lobe wedge resection in [**2102-10-8**].  He completed a
course of carboplatin and Taxol as well as radiation therapy.

A follow-up CT scan in [**2103-6-8**] and [**2103-9-8**] showed
interval worsening of the pulmonary nodules as well as
retroperitoneal lymph nodes.  He was started on taxotere
therapy in [**2103-8-8**].  In [**2103-10-8**], an isolated brain
metastases was discovered, status post suboccipital
craniotomy with resection of tumor and stereotactic
radiosurgery in [**2103-11-8**].

The patient presented to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital the Saturday
prior to admission with atypical right sided chest pain.
There, a CT angiogram showed small filling defects of
tertiary branches of his pulmonary vasculature and a
pericardial effusion.  He was started on heparin, with a drop
in his platelet count from 244,000 to 130,000 in three days.
He was believed to have HIT and was transferred to
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for Hirudin therapy.

In the Emergency Room, the patient was comfortable, with a
heart rate in the 120s and a blood pressure 110 to 120/70.
His oxygen saturation was 98% on two liters.  A repeat CT
angiogram showed tiny nonocclusive filling defects in the
lower lobes bilaterally, consistent with emboli, and a large
pericardial effusion with a pulsus of 30.  An emergent
echocardiogram was performed that was consistent with
tamponade.  The patient was taken to the catheterization
laboratory for pericardiocentesis under fluoroscopy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Stage IV adenocarcinoma with clear
cell features of lung, as described above.  2.  Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Accupril 10 mg p.o.q.d.,
Prednisone 10 mg p.o.q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smoked one pack per day for
forty years and occasionally uses alcohol.  He has no history
of drug abuse.  He is married and lives with his wife.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
was a pleasant male in no acute distress who was afebrile
with a heart rate of 115, respiratory rate 20s, blood
pressure 90s/60s with an oxygen saturation of 98% on two
liters.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Unremarkable.
Neck:  No jugular venous distention.  Lungs:  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Tachycardiac with
no murmurs but a rub in systolic and diastole loudest at the
apex.  Abdomen:  Benign.  Extremities:  Without edema, groin
sites looked good.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 11.6, hematocrit
29.7, platelet count 237,000 and normal differential.
Coagulation studies showed a prothrombin time of 14.6, INR
1.5 and partial thromboplastin time 34.1.  Chem-7 showed a
sodium of 135, chloride 101, bicarbonate 20, BUN 22 and
creatinine 1.4.  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia
with biphasic P waves but normal voltage criteria after
catheterization.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 26762**] was admitted to the Coronary Care
Unit after a pericardial drain was placed in the
catheterization laboratory.  He was observed to have a large
amount of serosanguinous drainage that tapered off over two
days.  The drain was successfully removed after a repeat
echocardiogram showed minimal reaccumulation and he had
drained less than 25 cc over 24 hours.

A repeat echocardiogram performed 24 hours after the drain
was pulled showed no further reaccumulation of fluid.  The
drainage fluid was positive for malignant cells and so was
likely secondary to lung metastases.

As anticoagulation for his pulmonary embolism was
contraindicated secondary to his bleeding pericardial
metastases, an inferior vena cava filter was placed to lower
the risk of future pulmonary embolism.

The patient's oncologists, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 26763**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], had a
discussion with him regarding his life expectancy, which is
about one month secondary to his underlying disease.  The
patient understood this and wished to remain a full code.

After the repeat echocardiogram after drain removal was
negative, the patient was discharged home to follow up with
an echocardiogram in three days to evaluate for recurrence of
the fluid.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Improved.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Tamponade secondary to pericardial metastases.
2.  Pulmonary embolism, status post inferior vena cava filter
    placement.
3.  Stage IV metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung.
4.  Hypertension.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Prednisone 10 mg p.o.q.d.
