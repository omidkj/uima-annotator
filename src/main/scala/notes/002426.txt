unstable angina. Cardiac catheterization revealed severe 3-
vessel coronary disease with preserved left ventricular
function. The patient was therefore referred for coronary artery
bypass grafting.

Pertinent Results:
  [**2106-6-16**] Intra-op TEE for CABG

PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or  color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left  ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%).
3. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right
ventricular systolic  function is normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in  the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis.  Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive  infusions including phenylephrine.
1. Regional and global left ventricular systolic function are
normal. Right  ventricular systolic function is normal.
2. MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1506**]

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 15848**],[**Known firstname 1112**]  was admitted on [**2105-6-16**] for an elective
surgery.

Pre-operatively, he was consented, prepped, and brought down to
the operating room for surgery.

He underwent the below procedure:

PROCEDURE:
1.  Coronary artery bypass grafting x4 left internal mammary
    artery to left anterior descending coronary; reverse
    saphenous vein single graft from aorta to the 1st
    diagonal coronary artery; reverse saphenous vein single
    graft from aorta to the 1st obtuse marginal coronary
    artery; as well as reverse saphenous vein single graft
    from aorta to the distal right coronary artery.
2.  Endoscopic left greater saphenous vein harvesting.

Intra-operatively, he was closely monitored and remained
hemodynamically stable. He tolerated the procedure well without
any difficulty or complication. Post-operatively, transferred to
the CSRU for further stabilization and invasive monitoring.
Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without any sequele. After extubation he was
transfered to the floor in stable condition. On the floor, he
remained hemodynamically stable with his pain controlled. He
remained in a normal sinus rhyth without atrial or ventricular
arrhythmias. He progressed with physical therapy to improve his
strength and mobility. He continues to make steady progress
without any incidents.  He was discharged home with services on
postoperative day five.
