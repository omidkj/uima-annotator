History of Present Illness:
This is a 61 year-old female with a history of diabetes who was
involved in a motor vehicle collision. She was transferred to
the [**Hospital1 190**] by Life Flight.  On initial evaluation, she was
hemodynamically stable with a GCS of 15. She had a clearly
identifiable right lower extremity injury. The right ankle had a
compound fracture with the tibia protruding out
over the skin and the whole right foot displaced anteromedially.
There was clear avulsion of nearly all of the posterior and
medial as well as lateral structures and the foot was tethered
to the leg anteriorly by skin and connective tissue bridge. She
also had a degloving injury to the right thigh as well as a
laceration to the left thigh. She had bilateral Charcot foot and
her vascular exam was significant for palpable femoral and
popliteal pulses
bilaterally. She had pulses to her left foot, however, there was
no appreciable pulse on the right foot although the right foot
did have capillary refill.  Given the degree of the
neurovascular injury in combination with the orthopedic
injury, it was felt that there would be no meaningful recovery
of function for this mangled extremity and the decision was made
to amputate the foot after discussion with the patient and her
son who agreed with the plan.
