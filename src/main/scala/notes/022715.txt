Service:  Purple Surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Patient was admitted for an operative
procedure to repair ventral hernia, radical excision of
squamous cell carcinoma, an excision of sinus tract.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 77-year-old
gentleman with a history of left squamous cell carcinoma on
his stomach and left flank, who underwent placement of tissue
expanders on [**2150-10-26**].  The patient is returning for
removal of the tissue expanders as well as excision of the
left flank squamous cell carcinoma.

PREVIOUS MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease.
2. Hypertension.
3. Melanoma of the stomach.
4. Necrotizing fasciitis.
5. Status post nephrectomy.
6. Myocardial infarction x2.
7. Angina.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Cartia 100 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3. Prazosin 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4. Percocet 1-2 tablets p.o. q.4-6h. prn pain.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
on [**2151-2-8**] and underwent the operative procedure
performed by the Purple Surgery service with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
and the Plastic Surgery service performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
Patient tolerated the procedure without any difficulty and
there were no complications.  For full description, please
see the operative notes dated [**2-8**].

Following the operation, the patient was transferred to the
Trauma SICU for initial recovery.  Patient was noted to have
an increase in O2 requirement and tachycardia, and a chest
x-ray at that time showed a right lower lobe collapse.
Following the patient's extubation, the patient's O2
saturation was 85% on 3 liters nasal cannula prompting his
transfer to the SICU.

On postoperative day #3, the patient underwent acute
pulmonary decompensation with severe hypoxia and patient had
to be reintubated.  Patient tolerated the reintubation
without any difficulty.  Following the patient's intubation,
the patient underwent a bronchoscopy and a bronchoalveolar
wash was done.  Returning was blood tinged fluid from the
left lobes.  The fluid returned from the wash was cultured
and grew out Serratia marcescens.  Due to these cultures, the
patient was placed on levofloxacin and Zosyn.

Also on [**2-11**], the patient developed atrial fibrillation
with his heart rate oscillating between the 90s to 160s.  The
patient was on a Cardizem drip, and was given Lopressor,
which did not manage either his heart rate nor his rhythm.
The patient was then started on amiodarone drip following 150
mg IV bolus.  The patient had to be electrically cardioverted
and then was able to maintain his rhythm on the amiodarone
drip.

Over the next couple days through [**2-16**], the patient
remained intubated and continued to produce large quantities
of thick sputum, which hampered his extubation.  Patient did
have one respiratory trial with decreased amount of PEEP, but
this was not tolerated and the patient was maintained on the
ventilator.  Patient had to be continually suctioned every
2-3 hours for a thick tan yellow sputum.

From a cardiovascular standpoint, the patient remained in
normal sinus rhythm and had no further episodes of atrial
fibrillation.  On [**2-17**], the patient was seen and
evaluated by Cardiology for an elevated troponin and a
borderline MB index.  Patient was complaining of slight
amount of chest pain corresponding to the increase in
troponin, which was worrisome for evolving myocardial
ischemia.

It was advised that the patient would be increased on his
beta-blocker, placed on aspirin, and to have an
echocardiogram performed.  The patient underwent
echocardiogram on the [**2-17**] and this showed the
following:  Severe global left ventricular systolic
dysfunction of multivessel coronary artery disease, and
moderate mitral valve regurgitation.

Following the echocardiogram, the patient was placed on
lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d. and increased up to 10 mg as he was
able to tolerate that.  It was also advised that the patient
undergo a stress test with the resolution of his current
acute illness either as an inpatient or following discharge.
Patient's Toprol XL was also increased to 100 mg p.o. q.d.
and the patient was continued on amiodarone 200 mg q.d.

On [**2-18**], postoperative day #10, the patient was weaned
down to pressure support, and was able to tolerate this well.
Patient continued to have vast quantities of thick white
secretions.  His lungs were clear overall.  Patient continued
to be diuresed.  Planned to get 1-2 liters off per day.

On [**2-19**], the patient was extubated and was able to
maintain his oxygen saturations on 50% FIO2 via face mask
tent.  Patient was started on clear liquids and his diet was
advanced as tolerated.

On [**2-21**], the patient was transferred out of the unit
onto the surgical floor.  While on the floor, the patient had
an uneventful recovery and was able to be discharged to acute
rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to
acute care facility.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was instructed to
followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**11-27**] weeks following discharge
and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] during the same time period.  Patient was
advised to please call to make these appointments.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was discharged in good
condition:  Afebrile, tolerating regular diet without
difficulty, ambulating with assistance.  Maintaining oxygen
saturations with supplemental oxygen.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Status post resection of squamous cell carcinoma of the
left flank.
2. Status post excision of sinus tract.
3. Status post removal of tissue expanders.
4. Status post ventral hernia repair.
5. Omental flap harvest.
6. Status post advancement of skin flaps.
7. Myocardial infarction x2.
8. Coronary artery disease.
9. Reintubation for hypoxia.
10. Prolonged intubation.
11. Atrial fibrillation.
12. Electrocardioversion.

1. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
