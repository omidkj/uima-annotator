Chief Complaint:
PNA

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy c stent removal

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5395**] is a 53 year-old female with a recent diagnosis of
non-small cell lung cancer who admitted to OSH on [**7-27**] for
dyspnea for 1-2 days PTA. In addition, she reported increased
respiratory secretions, fevers and chills. At OSH, she was found
to have PNA and there was concern about a possible stent
obstruction so she was transferred to BICMC on [**7-29**] for urgent
bronchscopy and stent evaluation. On [**7-29**] she underwent rigid
bronchoscopy and it was found that her y-stent migrated so it
was removed was removed. She was noted to have thrush in her
trachea. She was intubated for the procedure and it was decided
to keep the patient ventillated post-bronch given the severity
of her PNA.
.
Currently, she has been mildly hypotensive this morning, but is
currently off pressors thought to be secondary to a medication
effect. She is intubated and sedated and appears comfortable.
.
Review of systems: unable to obtain [**12-22**] sedation
.

Past Medical History:
# NSCLC - Received her first cycle of carboplatin and Taxol
chemotherapy [**2178-7-9**] & Silicone Y-stent placed [**2178-7-4**]
# tracheal stent placement
# SVC obstruction on CT scan
# GERD

CT chest [**7-29**]: Large right upper lung mass amputating the right
upper lobe bronchus causing post-obstructive right upper lobe
collapse. The mass also attenuates the right upper lobe
pulmonary artery and vein and ends into the mediastinum causing
atelectasis in the superior segment of the right lower lobe and
left lower lobe. Diffuse, scattered pulmonary nodules suggest
metastatic disease and interlobular septal thickening consistent
with lymphangitis carcinomatosa, Superimposed centilobular
nodules with a tree- in- [**Male First Name (un) 239**] configuration probably due to
recent infection The adrenal gland thickening is probably a
metastasis.

         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 53 yo with recent diagnosis of NSCLC who presented to
OSH with pneumonia she is s/p y-stent removal at [**Hospital1 18**] and is
being transferred to the ICU team for further management as
unable to extubate after stent removal.
.
# Respiratory failure - Per the pulmonary team, the patient was
intubated for airway protection in preparation for her
bronchoscopy and stent removal, new stent could not be placed
[**12-22**] anatomy. Given her substantial pnuemonia she was not able to
be extubated post-procedure. Pt was maintained on mechanical
ventilation in AC mode at ARDSnet settings. Pt required sedation
with midazolam and fentanyl in order to remain synchronous c the
vent. Pt's prognosis was felt to be very poor and family
ultimately felt that pt would not have wanted to remain
intubated and pt was transitioned to CMO on [**2178-8-8**]. Pt was
terminally extubated on [**2178-8-8**]. Her oxygen saturations dropped
precipitously and pt became bradycardic and then asystolic.
Family was at the bedside.
.
# Hypotension - Patient was hypotensive upon arrival to th
