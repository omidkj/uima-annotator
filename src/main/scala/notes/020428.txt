Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Dilantin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
[**Hospital **] transfer from rehab facility

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
triple lumen VIP hemodialysis catheter placed
HD on [**6-11**]
Multiple PICC line placements

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 61 y/o male w/ a paravertebral abscess, vertebral
osteomyelitis, T3-T4 epidural abscess, and a significant PMH of
CAD (s/p PIC in '[**11**]), HT, DM II, and morbid obesity who comes
into the ER w/ a 4d h/o lethargy/AMS/decreased urine output.  He
was dx w/ a paravertebral abscess and MRSA osteomyelitis 6wks
ago ([**4-30**]).  Surgery was deemed to be too high risk because of
his weight and the proximity of the abscess to the spine so he
was treated w/ IV vancomycin and transfered to rehab.  In rehab,
he lost IV access ([**6-2**]) and refused line placement.
Resultingly, he was started on gentamycin po tid (no levels
checked).
.
Since [**6-6**], the pt was noted to have lethargy, tea colored urine
w/ decreased urine output, altered mental status, N/V, and
diarrhea.  Labs were sent and his Cr was 5.3 (previous 1.1).  At
this time he noted decreased PO intake for [**12-14**] wks but denied
fever/HA/paresthesia.  Pt was admitted to the MICU.

Past Medical History:
1. MRSA Bacteremia
2. MRSA osteo of vertebrae and para-vertebral abscess,
not drained because too close to the spine, no [**Doctor First Name **] due to high
risk
3. HTN
4. Morbid Obesity (~500lbs per pt report -> bedbound X3y)
5. CAD s/p MI stents
6. DMII
7. Depression
8. Anxiety

Social History:
He reports that he quit smoking yrs ago. He denies alcohol/drug
use. He lives with wife and son and has been bedbound for 3yrs.
Until he got the MRSA infection, he was able to transfer from
bed to WC without assistance.  At this point, he is unable to
transfer without max assist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was seen in the ER w/ ARF, hyperkalemia, N/V/D, and AMS
changes.  He was intermittantly hypotensive and required NS
bolus but remained afebrile.  While awaiting nephrology
evaluation, he experienced an episode of shaking limbs and
unresponsiveness.  He had shaking movements of his arms for
several seconds and was then unarousable to sternal rub for [**4-21**]
minutes.  After being aroused, he remained lethargic and
confused for several minutes.  He was admitted to General
Medicine.
.
1.  ARF: Following the seizure-like episode, he had a R
subclavian VIP HD line placed and received 1g of vancomycin.  He
went to HD at 3:30pm and tolerated the process well.  He
maintained his BP in the 110/80 range w/ a HR of 70 and had 0.5L
removed during the procedure.  Neurology was consulted for the
seizure activity and the patient was loaded on dilantin, with no
side effects and no further episodes.  The patient was
transferred to the MICU with hypotension and bradycardia that
responded gradually to fluid rescusitation.  The patient was
stabilized and transferred to the general medicine floor.  His
creatinine continued to improve with fluids.  A repeat UA showed
muddy casts in the spun urine consistent with ATN.  His renal
function continued to improve up to discharge.  It is felt that
his ARF was due to a combination of prerenal azotemia and ATN,
possibly secondary to supratherapeutic levels of gentamycin.  At
time of discharge, his Cr had stabilized at about 1.1-1.2, and
his urine output was good.  He has chronic floey at this point
due to difficulty voiding.
.
2.  NSTEMI:  Following the HD, the patient had an episode of
hypotension and bradycardia, requiring transfer to the MICU for
further observation and care.  The patient was rescusitated with
fluid boluses, but he developed angina.  A troponin and EKG were
performed, revealing NSTEMI.  The patient was started on ASA,
Plavix, and a heparin gtt.  Unfortunately, the heparin had to be
discontinued as the patient developed bleeding complications
from a peri-scrotal tear that has been a chronic problem for
years.  The patient had no further anginal symptoms throughout
his stay, and was discharged on ASA and plavix (does not
tolerate B.block).
.
3.  MRSA osteomyelitis and MRSA epidural abscess:  Cultures were
negative on admission for MRSA bacteremia.  The patient was
started on IV Vancomycin on admission, renally dosed.  Levels
were closely followed by ID throughout the hospitalization.  The
patient had an Open MRI in [**Month (only) **], prior to his arrival.  His
vancomycin is to be continued for 8-10 weeks after starting.  He
was dosed Q48h, then based on a trough of 15-20, and now that
his renal function has improved and stabilized, he has been on
Vanco 1g IV q12 hours (want trough 15-20).  He remained afebrile
toward the later half of this admission, with normal WBC counts,
and markedly reduced back pain.  Repeat ESR and CRP were done
prior to discharge to be used as baseline for ID follow up.

4. Yeast UTI: Treated for seven days with fluconazole, with
resolution.

5. Sleep apnea: pt was complaining of shortness of breath and
difficulty sleeping.  Pulmonology saw the patient, and diagnosed
OSA. They recommended a trial of BiPAP, which the patient tried
several times, but was unable to tolerate the mask.  He feels as
though he wants to try it again in the future, maybe with a
different machine.  He was not complaining of difficulty
breathing upon discharge.  He was using

6. Mental status changes: Pt developed some confusion /
agitation during the hospitalization.  It was felt to be a
combination of toxic (oxycodone among others) or metabolic
deliurium.  EEG / Blood cultures were obtained and were
negative.  He had no new localizing signs.  Psychiatry was
consulted and decreased dose of oxycontin, recommended haldol,
and continuing anxiety meds.  Haldol was given [**Hospital1 **] for one week,
and he was at baseline, so decreased it to PRN.  He was
completely back to baseline mental status at time of discharge,
and stablized on medical regimen of SSRI / klonopin / Haldol
