Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
3rd degree heart block

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pacemaker placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4886**] is a 61 year old female with history of seizures,
hypothyroidism, CAD who presents from OSH with third degree
heart block. Patient is sedated and family not available to
provide history. Reportedly this AM patient was found down after
using the bathroom. She was taken to [**Hospital3 5365**] and found
to be minimally responsive with HR 30s, low BP. She was given
atropine x1 with reported improved perfusion. Right IJ placed
and patient started on levophed. BP improved after atropine so
levophed d/c'd. She was given 4L IVF and started on dopamine
gtt. It was determined at [**Hospital1 **] to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further managment. Medics began transcutaneous pacing, placed
Aline and intubated patient in transport. Of note, she
reportedly had CP in AM but refused to go to ER for evaluation.

.
The patient denies any chest pain or pressure, new exertional
dyspnea, orthopnea, PND or leg edema, palpitations or syncope,
claudication-type symptoms, melena, rectal bleeding, or
transient neurologic deficits.  No change in weight, bowel habit
or urinary symptoms. No cough, fever, night sweats, arthralgias,
myalgias, headache or rash.  All other review of systems
negative.

In the ED here, HR 70, BP 160/80, vented on AC 100% FiO2. Labs
notable for INR 2.1. She was seen by EP. RIJ was exchanged for
cordis and temporary wire was placed with good capture. She was
also sent for CT head which was negative for acute bleed but
showed evidence of subacute/chronic occipital and parietal
infarcts.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient was intubated and paced at a
rate of 70s. Dopamine was quickly weaned off and BPs have
remained stable. She was responsive to some commands.

Blood cx no growth [**2-23**], [**2-24**] x 3

CT head [**2-22**] IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial pathology. Please note MRI is more
sensitive for
evaluation of acute ischemia.
2. Extensive sequelae of chronic small vessel disease as well as
chronic
infarcts involving the occipital and parietal lobes bilaterally.


Echo [**2-23**] There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with anterior wall hypokinesis. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 40%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Limited study. Mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction. No pericardial effusion.

UE US IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT.

CTA IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2. Findings consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
3. Bibasilar atelectasis, small pleural effusions, bilateral
scattered tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearance indicative of an infectious or
inflammatory process.
4. Lipoma below the right scapula.

P MIBI [**2181-2-28**]
IMPRESSION: 1. Severe fixed perfusion defect in the proximal and
mid
antero-septal and infero-septal wall, and moderate fixed defects
in the inferior wall. 2. Septal akinesis and inferior wall
hypokinesis. 3. Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction.

[**2181-2-28**] Foot XR: IMPRESSION: Oblique non-displaced fracture of
the fifth metatarsal and likely transverse non-displaced
fracture along the base of the fifth metatarsal.

[**2181-2-25**] CXR
FINDINGS: No relevant changes compared to the previous
radiograph. Moderate cardiomegaly, and no relevant
overhydration. Minimal dorsal effusions could be present.
Unchanged position of pacemaker.

[**2181-2-22**] AP PORTABLE CHEST: Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes
are in good position. A right internal jugular temporary
pacemaker lead terminates in the right ventricle. No
pneumothorax. There are low inspiratory volumes. Apparent
widening of the mediastinum is accounted for by supine
positioning given this is within normal range on subsequent
upright radiographs which are available for review at the time
of dictation.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 year old female with history of seizures, hypothyroidism,
CAD, admitted with third degree heart block.

# Third degree heart block: Heart block likely secondary to
progression of prior disease vs ischemia related. Pt had
permanent pacemaker placed on arrival. The patient was ruled out
with 3 sets flat biomarkers. She was initially planned for
cardiac cath but refused. She had stress MIBI with only fixed
defects. No further arrhythmias or episodes of heart block. She
will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in device clinic.

# Fever: Patient spiked fever [**2100-2-22**]. Culures positive only for
urine culture with e-coli and HAFNIA ALVEI both sensitive to
cipro. ID was consulted regarding management and she will
complete 7 day course of ciprofloxacin. She also was empirically
started on vanco due to recent pacemaker placement but this was
disco
