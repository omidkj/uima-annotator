Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 81-year-old
male with past medical history significant for AFib on
Coumadin and coronary artery disease status post MI [**2122-1-6**], who was in his usual state of health when at 5 p.m. on
the day of admission, he felt lightheaded.  Had six bowel
movements each with increasing softness and increasing
intensity of the red color.  Following this episode, he
became diaphoretic, incoherent, but denied remembering any
chest pain or shortness of breath.  EMS was called at that
time.  He denies any history of a GI bleed.  He does take
aspirin, but denies any other NSAID use.  Per his wife, he
had underwent colonoscopy which was normal less than five
years ago.  He denies any fevers, chills, or weight loss.

In the Emergency Room, a nasogastric tube was placed and 200
cc of coffee ground substance, which was heme positive was
obtained before clearing.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

[**Hospital 1459**] Hospital.
2. Status post MI in [**2122-4-6**] treated at [**Hospital6 111530**] medical management only.  Treadmill stress
test three weeks ago revealed a normal echocardiogram.
3. AFib on anticoagulation status post pacemaker.
4. Hypertension.
5. Glaucoma.
6. Hypercholesterolemia.
7. Status post cataract surgery.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  History of tobacco use, quit 18 years ago,

respiratory rate 14, sating 97% on room air.  In general,
patient is pale, but appears to be in no apparent distress.
HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Moist
mucous membranes.  Nasogastric tube with occasional clots via
suction.  No scleral icterus.  Neck:  No lymphadenopathy, no
thyromegaly.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and rhythm with
a 2/6 systolic murmur at the base.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Increased bowel sounds,
soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Rectal:  Melena by
report.  Extremities:  Ecchymoses noted on the left lower
extremity.  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Neurologic:
Alert and oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through
XII are grossly intact.  Strength 5/5 throughout with normal
sensation.

LABORATORIES AND DIAGNOSTICS:  Admission hematocrit is 30.2.
Outside hospital records from [**6-23**] revealed a hematocrit of
37.  White blood cell count 7.5, hemoglobin 9.9, platelets of
277.  Sodium 140, potassium 5.5, chloride 106, bicarb 25, BUN
27, creatinine 1.2, glucose 168.  PTT 33, INR 3.3.

EKG revealed atrial fibrillation at a rate of 74 with a
normal axis, normal intervals.  ST depression in II, III, and
aVF, a biphasic P wave in V3 and T-wave inversion in V4 to
V6.

EGD from [**2125-7-5**] revealed a single 15 mm ulcer in the
anterior bulb of the duodenum with a visible vessel.  H.
pylori antibody by [**Doctor First Name **] was negative.

Troponin-T peaked at 0.10 during this admission, however, CK
MB remained negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient admitted with likely upper GI
bleed, kept NPO overnight for EGD in the morning following
multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells and FFP.  He
developed pulmonary edema, which complicated his ability to
undergo EGD.

His pulmonary edema was managed and he was able to undergo
EGD on [**2125-7-5**] revealing a single duodenal ulcer with
visible vessel, which was cauterized.  His hematocrit
subsequently stabilized, and he was discharged from the ICU
three days later.

1. GI bleed:  On admission, patient having melanotic stools
with positive gastric lavage.  Hemodynamically stable, thus
EGD was deferred until the morning.  The patient remained
NPO.  Underwent EGD in the morning, however, copious amounts
of blood prevented good visualization of the source of the
bleed.  Initial plan was for repeat EGD later in the
afternoon.  However, patient had received a total of 3 units
of packed red blood cells and 2 units of FFP, and
subsequently developed increased shortness of breath and
tachypnea.

He was treated for pulmonary edema and underwent EGD on
[**2125-7-5**], which revealed a single anterior duodenal anterior
bulb ulcer, which GI attempted to clip.  However, BICAP
electrocautery was ultimately required for hemostasis.
Postprocedure, patient's hematocrit slowly trended down from
37.2 to 31.3, however, his hematocrit stabilized over the
next two days, and he was discharged home from the ICU.

2. Coagulopathy:  Patient with admission INR of 3.3 secondary
to Coumadin.  Patient received 2 units of FFP and 10 mg of
vitamin K.  Subsequent INR was 2.0, thus he received an
additional 3 units of FFP with an ultimate INR of 1.4.
Decision was made for patient to remain off anticoagulation
for the next several weeks following discharge considering
this most recent GI bleed.

3. Pulmonary edema:  Patient developed acute dyspnea with
hypoxia one day following admission.  The patient was at that
point status post 2 units of FFP and 3 units of packed red
blood cells.  He was given IV Lasix x3 at a dose of 40, 40,
and 60 in addition to 10 mg of IV Lopressor.  He required
face mask and CPAP to maintain his sats, however, was able to
be converted back to nasal cannula within a few hours at
which time he received an additional 120 mg of IV Lasix.

4. Coronary artery disease:  Patient was switched from
atenolol to metoprolol.
