Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
angioedema


Discharge Condition:
stable, improved


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with throat swelling, which
was an exacerbation of your chronic angioedema. We treated you
with steroids and admitted you to our ICU for close airway
monitoring since you have needed intubation in the past to
protect your airway. You improved quickly and were never in any
respiratory compromise.

You were also found to be very iron deficient, a condition which
is causing you to be anemic. You are being prescribed iron
pills. You are also being given prescriptions for stool
softeners since iron can make you constipated.

Please note that you will be discharged with a prescription for
a steroid taper. It is very important that you take these, as
well as all of your previous medications, as prescribed. Please
keep all of your outpatient appointments. If you experience any
further shortness of breath, facial or mouth swelling, or any
symptoms which disturb you, please call your doctor, consider
using an epipen, or go to the ER.
