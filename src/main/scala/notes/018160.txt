HPI: The patient is a 80y/o M with a PMH of CAD, HTN, PVD, COPD
admitted to neurology service for new onset seizure now
transferred to MICU following bradycardic arrest. Per admission
note, the patient lives at a NH and was found to have leftward
eye deviation after eating breakfast this am, followed by
generalized tonic-clonic activity. Unclear duration of symptoms.
He was given 1mg Ativan, was noted to have incontinence of bowel

He was admitted to neurology service with preliminary workup
including Head CT negative. On the evening of transfer, Code
Blue was called at approx. 2am for asystole. Chest compressions
were briefly administered ~1min prior to code team arrival. Per
report the patient had bradycardia followed by asystole with
spontaneous return of circulation. The patient was intubated for
agonal breathing. 2PIV and L femoral line were placed. He
received ativan 2 mg without response. The patient was given 1mg
