Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
69 year old women with dyspnea on exertion and leg swelling x1
week. The pt has a history of COPD and is at home baseline at
2L.  The pt reports that for the past week she's been having
increasing shortness of breath particularly when walking, using
3 pillows at night to sleep and could not sleep laying flat, and
that her legs have been swelling up bilaterally.  The pt
reported the ED at [**Hospital1 **] where she was evaluated, and had
a CXR that showed "mild pulmonary edema", she had an elevated
BNP of 1400, and one negative troponin while there, with an ECG
NSR 95 NANI, no STTWc, but no comparison.  The pt was diuresed
1300ml there with IV Lasix 40, and was given SoluMedrol, and
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] due to full capacity there.  The
working diagnosis of her admission was COPD exacerbation versus
new onset CHF.  The pt endorsed headaches for the past week as
well.  The pt reportedly did not endorse fever or chills, nausea
or vomiting, productive cough, chest pain, rhinorrhea,
congestion, sore throat, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena,
dysuria or hematuria.

STUDIES:

CXR
SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST

REASON FOR EXAM: Assess ET tube.

CXXR [**2181-9-5**]
ET tube tip is in the right main bronchus, should be pulled back
4-5 cm to
standard position. NG tube tip is out of view below the
diaphragm. Cardiac
size is top normal. There is no evident pneumothorax or pleural
effusion.
The patient has known COPD. Mild right apical thickening is of
unknown
chronicity. Right lower lobe opacity is new could be due to
atelectasis, but aspiration cannot be excluded and attention in
followup study is recommended

CXR  9/29/1
FINDINGS: Removal of right internal jugular vascular catheter
with no visible pneumothorax. Standard position of endotracheal
tube, nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. Heart size
remains normal. No focal areas of consolidation are evident
within the lungs. Mild elevation of left
hemidiaphragm is unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 69 y/o woman with PMHx significant for COPD requiring 2L
oxygen at home and anxiety presenting with COPD exacerbation and
?mild CHF.

COPD/Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure: Pt found to have FEV1 of
19%, putting her in the very severe staging of Gold's criteria
and was gently diuresed.   Pt was started on azithromycin 500 mg
X1 and then 250 mg daily.  On hospital day #1 she became
increasingly somnolent and found to have a PCO2 of 179. She was
transferred to the ICU. Unclear etiology of patients respiratory
failure. Potential etiology included ativan use in the setting
of COPD, however this was an extremely small dose and the
patient had been taking it routinely in the evening at home.
Recent respiratory infection as a trigger could not be ruled
out.  Cardiac cause has also been entertained, but pt had
negative troponin X3 and no EKG changes suggestive of STEMI.
Additionally her TTE was normal.  Infectious workup has been
negative.  Pt was intubated upon transfer to MICU. Her
antiobiotcs and steroids were continued. Pt was successfully
extubated on 2nd day of MICU. She continued to maintain good O2
sats on floor.

Prednisone was started at 40 mg, with a plan to taper 10 mg
every 2 days.  Pt was also treated with albuterol and
ipratropium neb.  After return to the floor
salmeterol-fluticasone was initiated. Pt needs a pulmonologist,
has never previously seen one. We scheduled an appointment for
her in the [**Hospital 2182**] clinic here at [**Hospital1 18**]. She will be discharged and
go to outpatient pulmonary rehab.

#. Altered Mental Status: Initially on the floor pt was very
stable, with no trouble breathing or complaints otherwise.
Laughing and conversing with the team. That evening, there was
concerned for her behavior.  The team reported that she was
acting "normal" when she was admitted but became increasingly
more confused.  The floor team did not report that the pt was
aphasic or had clear neurological deficit with any laterality or
focality, but was somnolent appearing.  ABG done on the pt on
the floor showed pCO2 of 179, and in the setting of her
worsening mental status and increased work of breathing, a
trigger was called and the pt intubated on the floor then
transfered to the unit.  On arrival to the MICU the pt was
comfortably sedated, hemodynamically stable.  Hypercarbia or
hypoxia seem like a reasonable diagnoses.  Her mental status
resolved upon the resolution of hypercarbia and extubation. Pt
did not exhibit any signs or symptoms of worsening
hypoxia/hypercapnia when she returned to the floor.

##UTI- Patient had a urinalysis with trace leukocytes, 35 WBC
and few bacteria performed yesterday, UCx pending. Patient has
no complaints of urinary urgency/frequency or dysuria but had a
foley in place during MICU stay.Pt started on cipro for UA
showing whites and bacteri
