[**6-26**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant system
demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had
no angiographically apparent coronary artery disease. The LAD
had a calcific proximal 80% lesion.  There was mild disease in
the distal vessel.  The LCx had a proximal 80% lesion after a
severely retroflexed takeoff.  The distal vessel was widely
patent.  The RCA had diffuse disease with serial 50% lesions in
the proximal, mid and distal portion. 2. Limited resting
hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right sided filling
pressures with RVEDP 14 mmHg.  The left sided filling pressures
were moderately elevated with PCWP of 18 mmHg.  The cardiac
index was calculated using an assumed oxygen consumption and was
2.1 l/min/m2. The central aortic pressure was normal at 136/60
mmHg.
[**6-27**] Carotid U/S: There is less than 40% stenosis within the
internal carotid arteries bilaterally.
[**6-27**] Chest CT: 1. Minimal calcification dilated ascending aorta.
2. Possible right upper lobe bronchogenic carcinoma. 3. Severe
cardiomegaly, predominantly left atrial and left ventricular,
possible pulmonary arterial hypertension, severe coronary
atherosclerosis. 4. Severe left basal atelectasis due to a
combination of moderate left pleural effusion and lower lobe
bronchomalacia. 5. Cystic liver lesions, not clearly benign
biliary cysts. Further evaluation recommended. 6. Possible 4 mm
mid esophageal polyp (4:80).
[**6-29**] Head MRI: No evidence of acute infarcts or enhancing brain
lesion. No mass effect or hydrocephalus. Mild changes of small
vessel disease and a small right parietal cortical chronic
infarct.

Intra-op TEE
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30% %). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Moderate (2+)
eccentric aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation
jet is eccentric and therefore difficult to quantify; unable to
obtain a useable pressure half time or decleration time on the
aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**12-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There are
pericardial calcifications.

Post Bypass: Patient is AV paced on Epinepherine 0.03
mcg/kg/min. Biventricular function appears slightly improved
LVEF 40% on ionotropes. Ventricular septum appears diskinetic,
consistent with ventricular pacing. Mitral regurgitation and
Aortic Regurgitation are unchanged from baseline. Tricuspid
regurgitation is now mild to moderate. Aortic contours intact.
Remaining Exam is unchanged. All findings discussed with
surgeons at the time of the exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 year old female who was admitted on [**2109-6-25**] complaining of
shortness of breath with PAF s/p multiple cardioversions and
failed drug therapy with increasing CHF symptoms and recent drop
in EF to 30%. On [**6-26**] she underwent a cardiac cath which
revealed severe coronary artery disease and she was referred for
surgical intervention. She was appropriately medically managed
and underwent extensive pre-operative work-up. On [**7-2**] she was
brought to the operating room where she underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft x 3. Please see operative report for
surgical details. Within 24 hours she was weaned from sedation,
awoke neurologically intact and extubated. Chest tubes were
removed on post-op day one. Beta-blockers and diuretics were
initiated and she was diuresed towards her pre-op weight. On
post-op day two she was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further care.  She did develop post-operative a-fib and was
started on amio and dig.  She had an episode of bradycardia, and
amiodarone and digoxin were discontinued.  Electrophysiology was
consulted for assistance with medical management.  She was
anti-coagulated with coumadin.  She worked with physical therapy
for strength and mobility.  She was not started on an ACE
inhibitor, as her blood pressure would not tolerate it, and the
primary goal was to titrate her beta-blocker as tolerated.  This
