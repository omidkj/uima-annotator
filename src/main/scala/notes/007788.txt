Physical Exam:
Admission:
VSS Afebrile. BP 114/73.RR-16 RAsat-97%
Neuro:grossly intact
Lungs- clear
Cor- SR at 66 5/6 systolic nurmur Rt sternal border.
Abd: benign
ext: negative

Pertinent Results:
[**3-24**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: 1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 2.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. 4. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. The ascending
aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 5. The aortic
valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. Significant aortic stenosis is present (not
quantified due to lack of doppler data). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study,
the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions including
phenylephrine and is being AV paced. 1. A well-seated stentless
prosthetic valve in the aortic position with normal leaflet
motion. No gradients were obtained, since no transgastric views
were obtained. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 2. LV function
is normal. 3. RV was mildly depressed. 4. An ascending aortic
and partial arch graft noted

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**3-24**] Mr.[**Known lastname **] was taken to the Operating Room where a #29mm
aortic root tissue valve/ Bentall procedure, coronary artery
bypass graft times two (left internal mammary artery grafted to
the left anterior descending artery/saphenous vein grafted to
the diagnal) and hemi-arch replacement(# 26mm gelweave) were
performed. Cross clamp time =194 minutes, Cardiopulmonary bypass
time= 239 minutes. Circulatory arrest time= 24 minutes. Please
refer to Dr[**Last Name (STitle) 5305**] operative report for further details.  He
weaned from bypass on Propofol and Neo-Synephrine.  Following
surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. He required a therapeutic bronchoscopy to
clear tenacious RUL mucus which caused RUL collapse. The lobe
promptly re-expanded after this. Pressors were weaned off over
36 hours and he weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. All lines and drains were removed in a
timely fashion. Beta blockers and diuresis were started and he
was diuresed to his pre-op weight. On post-op day three EP was
consulted for complete heart block. On [**3-28**] a permanent pacemaker
was placed. Following this he was transferred to the step down
unit for further telemetry and monitoring. EP interrogated  the
PPM. Plan for follow up in device clinic 1 week following
discharge. On post-operative day five he had failure to void and
a Foley was reinserted. A repeat void trial was not
successful.He is to see his urologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] in 1 week. He
continued to progress and on POD #8 was discharged to home with
VNA. All follow up appointments were advised.
