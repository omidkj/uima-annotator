History of Present Illness:
66 yo male CAD, PVD, hypertension who took his BP meds this
morning and several hours later felt nauseated, he dropped
himself to the ground and felt dizzy, weak, couldn't get off the
floor for 30 minutes. He believes he took his medications as

Micro:
[**2119-2-25**] BCx: negative
[**2119-2-26**] MRSA: negative
[**2119-2-26**] H. pylori: negative

Imaging:
[**2119-2-25**] CXR: Probable underlying emphysema without superimposed
acute process.

[**2119-2-26**] CT Torso:
Small amount of perihepatic and abominal ascites. Trace right
pleural effusion. No metastatic disease. Mildly enlarged heart.
AAA (infrarenal) measures 2.8cm (TV) x 2.7 cm (AP) not
significantly changed compared with US from [**2115**]. Bilateral
common iliac artery aneurysms not significanlty changed. No
bowel obstruction.

[**2119-2-27**] Echo: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-7-6**],
regional left ventricular systolic function is now normal. The
severity of aortic regurgitation is increased (but remains
mild). The aortic arch is now mildly dilated.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 year old male with CAD, PVD, HTN, h/o prostate CA, gout who
presented with extreme weakness this morning, found to be
hypotensive.
.
Pt looked okay on admission to MICU. He never needed pressors
and BP remained stable. His hypotension was attributed to meds
and poor PO intake. BP improved with fluids so adrenal
insufficiency was felt less likely and cortisol not checked. CT
Torso done for 5 lb weight loss and intermittent nausea to
evaluate for metastatic disease but no lytic lesions noted. He
was started on PPI in ICU for possible ulcer for
nausea/vomiting, though H. pylori titers were negative. His
anti-hypertensives were held and highest SBP was 140.
.
He was called on to the floor on [**2119-2-26**].  There he had a CT
torso to evaluate a possible malignancy, which came back
negative.  His PSA was normal and his iron studies were
suggestive of anemia of chronic disease.  He was normotensive,
so none of his antihypertensives were restarted, except for
doxazosin to avoid urinary retention.  An echocardiogram showed
normal LV function.  His creatinine continued to improve back to
his baseline.  In terms of his anemia and weightloss, he had no
further drop in his hematocrit, and it was decided that he would
continue to have work-up as an outpatient with close follow-up
with his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 11616**].  He should have an outpatient EGD and
titration of his blood pressure medications.  He was discharged
off of omeprazole because there was no convincing evidence that
his symptoms were caused by peptic ulcer disease.
