History of Present Illness:
The pt. is a 64 year-old male with a history of CAD who
presented to the ED with shortness of breath.  Per EMS notes,
the pt. called EMS complaining of labored breathing.  During
transport, the pt. had an episode of unresponsiveness.  On
arrival to the ED, the pt. had another episode of aspiration

and cough prior to becoming unresponsive.

.
CXR: Patchy bibasilar opacities L>R with associated pleural

.
TTE:  1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. 2. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
mid and apical
septal and anterior along with apical akinesis. 3. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 5.The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-31**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. 6.There is no pericardial

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 64 M with history of CAD, CHF presented
with respiratory distress/failure complicated by an aspiration
event and loss of consciousness.  During hospitalization the
following problems were addressed:

1. Respiratory failure: Patient presented with hypercarbic
respiratory failure.  Etiology likely multifactorial and due to
aspiration pneumonitis and possible obstructive lung disease
and/or community-acquired pneumonia.  The patient was intially
intubated, then extubated on day two.  He was continued on
levofloxacin and flagyl for a possible aspiration pneumonia.
Although no distinct infiltrate was seen on CXR, we could not
rule out a retrocardiac infiltrate.  He was also started on
albuterol and atrovent MDI for a possible COPD component.  He
would likely benefit from PFTs as an outpatient evaluation.
Sputum culture and gram stain pending.

3. Loss of consciousness: Possible hypoxic insult secondary to
aspiration vs hypercapneic from respiratory acidosis. Tox screen
was positive for opiates only after patient received them in ED.
 Per outside reports, patient has routine parole drug screenings
and has been negative.  Once sedation was weaned, his mental
status returned to baseline.

4. CHF: Pt. with known h/o of CAD and ischemic cardiomyopathy.
He was ruled out for acute MI although ECG shows Q-waves,
presumed old, and nonspecific T-wave changes in inferolateral
leads.  Echo showed moderately depressed LV function and apical
and septal wall motion abnormalities.  He was started on
aspirin, lipitor, metoprolol and lisinopril for secondary
prophylaxis.  Monitor for tolerance to metoprolol given presumed
COPD.

The patient tolerated a po diet.  PPx by SQ heparin and
pneumoboots.  He is a full code.  Unclear if he has a PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
should likey be referred for PFTs and stress test on discharge.
He is a full code.  His sister is involved in his care and was
the source of information while he was sedated, no designated
HCP.
