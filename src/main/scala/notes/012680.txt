scene.  1 fatality and 2 other critically injured persons at
scene. En route to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was intubated and sedated

Pertinent Results:
Chest/Abdominal CT: Large right pneumothorax. Right apical chest
tube surrounded by collapsed lung. Right lower lobe collapse and
possibly also contusion. Small foci of atelectasis or contusions
in the left lower lobe.  Pneumomediastinum. No evidence of
tracheal injury.  No evidence of abdominal or pelvic injury.

CT Face: Left orbital floor fracture, multiple bilateral
maxillary sinus fractures,  Bilateral nasal bone fractures,
findings indicate mid face fractures of Le forte Type 2

L foot x-ray: Transverse fracture of second middle phalanx, with
extension into articular space.

MRI c-spine: : Abnormal signal posteriorly at C6-C7 consistent
with the presence of ligamentous injury. Degenerative disk
disease C5-C6 and C6-C7 as described.


Brief Hospital Course:
41 y/o male s/p high speed MVA who sustained multiple injuries
including a large right pneumothorax, left orbital floor
fracture, multiple bilateral maxillary sinus fractures,
bilateral nasal bone fractures, ligamentous injury at C6-7, and
a transverse fracture of the second middle phalanx.  Other
studies including a head ct, neck ct, TLS films, and L arm film
were negative for injury.  The patient was brought in by EMS
intubated.  In the ER bilateral chest tubes and a left
subclavian central line were placed.  The patient was
hemodynamically stable and transfered to the T/SICU. Once there
another right sided chest tube was placed given that the first
had not adequately decompressed the large right sided
pneumothorax.  The patient's facial fractures were evaluated by
plastic surgery which reduced his nasal fracture.  There was no
indication for treatment of the other facial fractures at the
time.   The patient remained in the intensive care unit for 12
days.  Over the course of his stay there, he was treated w/
oxacillin and levoquin for pneumonia and treatment for C-diff
was initiated. Tube feeds were initiated.  The patient was
extubated on HD 11 and on HD 12 transfered to the floor for
further management. On the floor the patient's mental status
continued to improve and he was alert and oriented x 3 although
per his family, he still had not returned to his baseline.  At
discharge the patient was tolerating po and was able to ambulate
w/o difficulty.  He will be discharged to his sister's home and
will follow up with neurosurgery regarding his cervical spine
ligamentous injury, plastic surgery regarding his facial
fractures, and trauma clinic. He will also complete a 14 day
course of flagyl, a clonidine wean, and percocets as needed for
pain.
