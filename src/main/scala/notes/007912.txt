MRI brain [**7-17**] - Large necrotic masses with enhancing wall and
solid components in the left temporal lobe and left cerebellum.
The left cerebellar lesion is causing significant mass effect on
the fourth ventricle. Lesions are consistent with metastases. No
evidence of transependymal signal change to suggest acute
hydrocephalus.

CT brain [**7-17**] -
1. Status post left occipital craniectomy for resection of left
cerebellar
mass. There is expected pneumocephalus and post-surgical change,
as well as a 1.5 x 2.6 cm post-operative hematoma in the
resection bed. Continued close imaging followup is warranted.

2. Stable appearance of necrotic mass in the left
temporoparietal region,
with local mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle and no
significant
shift of midline structures.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST [**2116-7-19**]
 The patient is status post left occipital tumor resection in
the left
cerebellar hemisphere, the expected surgical changes are
visualized consistent with blood products and air in the
surgical cavity, this lesion has been decreased in size since
the prior study and the surgical bed is filling with blood
products and CSF. Supratentorially the cystic necrotic mass
lesion is redemonstrated with internal nodularity and
enhancement, relatively unchanged since the prior study. No new
metastatic lesions are visualized since the most recent
examination.



Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the ICU for close neuromonitoring.  A brain
MRI obtained on [**7-17**] demonstrated enhaninc cystic lesion in the
left cerbellar region and left temporal region consistent with
metastasis.  Surgical itervention was recommend and on [**7-17**], he
was taken to the OR where under general anesthesia he underwent
posterior fossa craniectomy resection of tumor. He tolerated
this procedure well and was extubated without incident.  He
returned to ICU in stable condition.  A post-op CT demonstrated
post-operative changes with hyperintensity in the surgical bed
likely surgical material and mild hemorrhage.

His ICU course was uncomplicated. He was started on subcutaneous
heparin and MRI was done. Dilantin level was 9.8. MRI showed
reduced size of lesion with blood in surgical bed, no new
metastatic lesion were seen. Patient was transferred to the
floor.

On [**7-20**], patient was nonfocal on examination, PT cleared him for
home and he was discharged to follow up in brain tumor clinic on
the [**4-26**].

Discharge Diagnosis:
Left cerebellar mass
Left temporal mass


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
??????	Have a friend/family member check your incision daily for
signs of infection.
??????	Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
??????	Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining,
or excessive bending.
??????	You may wash your hair only after sutures and/or staples have
been removed. If your wound closure uses dissolvable sutures,
you must keep that area dry for 10 days.
??????	You may shower before this time using a shower cap to cover
your head.
??????	Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain
medicine can cause constipation. We generally recommend taking
an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace)
while taking narcotic pain medication.
??????	Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any
anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and
Ibuprofen etc.
??????	If you have been prescribed Dilantin (Phenytoin) for
anti-seizure medicine, take it as prescribed and follow up with
laboratory blood drawing in one week.  This can be drawn at your
PCP??????s office, but please have the results faxed to [**Telephone/Fax (1) 87**].
If you have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam), you will
not require blood work monitoring.
??????	Clearance to drive and return to work will be addressed at
your post-operative office visit.
??????	Make sure to continue to use your incentive spirometer while
at home, unless you have been instructed not to.
