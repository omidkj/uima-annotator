TTE Conclusions
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free wall
function. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
The transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen.

IMPRESSION: limited views. Normal global LV function. Mildly
dilated/hypokinetic RV. The aortic valve prosthesis is not well
seen but has normal gradients and only trace regurgitation.
