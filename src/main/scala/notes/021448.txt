History of Present Illness:
76 yo M with h/o LGIB, htn, h/o cardiomyopathy s/p AICD, atrial
fibrillation, transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with BRBPR.  He
had several days of maroon clolored bowel movements at home,
with associated generalized weakness and dizziness. He presented
to the [**Hospital1 1474**] ED on the evening of [**2-27**] with hypotension to
100s/70s and HR 100s. His hematocrit was found to be 24.  A
right IJ central line was placed and he was admitted to the ICU.
His CXR demonstrated [**Hospital1 **]-basilar consolidation. ECG demonstrated
sinus tachycardiaat 105 bpm, normal axis and intervals, 1-[**Street Address(2) 16128**] depressions in V2-V5, TWI V6/II/III/aVF. No documentation of
cardiac enzymes or repeat ECG was available. he was resucitated
with 8 U PRBC and 8L NS. He required neosynephrine overnight to
maintain his BP. His tagged RBC scan on [**2-28**] at 2:25 pm showed no
evidence of GI bleed. Hgb/HCT before transfer was 12.8/36.9. he
was started on cipro for a UTI with urine culture demonstrating
>100,000 GNRs. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for potential IR
guided embolization.
On admission he complained only of a mild headache. He denied
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness. He c/o
shortness of breath when laying down. He denied chest pain or
cough.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2189-3-3**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size. Mild
regional LV
systolic dysfunction. Mild global LV hypokinesis.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
basal inferior
- akinetic; mid inferior - hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity. Severe global RV
free wall
hypokinesis.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Focal calcifications in
aortic root.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Calcified
tips of
papillary muscles. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
to moderate
[[**12-30**]+] TR. Severe PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Resting
tachycardia (HR>100bpm). Echocardiographic results were reviewed
by telephone
with the houseofficer caring for the patient. Left pleural
effusion.

Conclusions:
The left and right atrium are moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall
thickness and cavity size are normal. There is mild global left
ventricular
hypokinesis with more sefere hypokinesis/akinesis of the basal
half of the
inferior wall. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a more
extensive focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricular cavity
is moderately dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic
root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly
thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.






Brief Hospital Course:
76 y.o. M with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy CHF EF = 40%, s/p ICD
placement and removal, prsents from OSH with BRBPR who received
agressive resucitation and then developed respiratory distress.
.
Respiratory Distress:
After having stabalized from his GIB the patient developed
hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory distress which was thought
to be secondary to underlying lung disease of unclear etiology
for which he took advair and spiriva at home, fluid overload and
right sided heart failure and a hypoalbuminemic state.  (He
ruled out for ACS with mildly elevated troponins and flat CKs.)
We attempted to improve his fluid balance with diuresis with a
lasix drip, albumin and zaroxyln but this resulted in a rising
creatinine and thus this was d/c'ed.  Afte
