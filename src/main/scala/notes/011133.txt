Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted the Trauma Service. Repeat CTA  showed type III
Dens fracture with extension to transverse process on the right
involving the vertebral foramen, and fracture fragments
impinging on the right vertebral artery causing ~30% luminal
narrowing without transection.  Head, chest, abdomen and pelvic
imaging were negative for other injury. Orthopedic Spine Surgery
was consulted; an MRI was done to assess the patency of his
right vertebral artery and it was found to be intact without
evidence of injury.  After review of the films, he was taken by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] to the operating room for halo fixation to stabilize
his spine. There were no intraoperative complications. He was
taken to the Trauma ICU postoperatively and was  weaned from the
ventilator then extubated. Following extubation he remained
stable and was eventually transferred to the regular nursing
unit. He later developed a pneumonia and was treated with
Augmentin.

Social work was consulted for coping and for issues related to
EtOH use. He was provided with information pertaining to alcohol
counseling.
