History of Present Illness:
68 yo with PMH of HTN who was in good health until 2 weeks prior
to admission when he started having "flu like symptoms"
consistent with sore throat, left shoulder pain and fevers up to
103, patient took ibuprofen with no control of the symptoms. Of
note patient has very poor peridental care and 17 days ago "Pull

CT Neck/Chest [**2131-1-13**]:
1. In this patient with known necrotizing fasciitis status post
debridement, locules of air seen tracking along the left strap
muscles (from hyoid-thyroid level), left acromioclavicular joint
are concerning for additional sites of necrotizing infection.
Please refer to the CT neck for further information.
2. Multifocal bilateral pulmonary consolidations, with the
largest areas of consolidation in the left lower lobe and
lingula. Some of the foci in the left lung demonstrate
cavitiation. Differential considerations for these findings are
multi-focal pneumonia, multifocal necrotizing pneumonia, or
possibly septic emboli.
3. Moderate-sized left pleural effusion.

RUQ US [**2131-1-13**]:
A small hypoechoic nodule adjacent to the gall bladder fossa.
Although this could represent an area of focal fat, the liver
does not appear to be
echogenic on the current exam. Therefore further
characterization of this
area is recommended with an MRI when clinically appropriate.
Normal gallbladder.

CT Head [**2131-1-19**]:
1. No evidence of intracranial process.
2. Fluid within the sphenoid sinuses, mastoid air cells, and
middle ear
cavities is consistent with history of recent intubation.

CT Chest [**2131-1-21**]:
1. Interval progression of the large left pleural effusion which
now appears loculated and is concerning for an empyema, although
assessment is difficult in the absence of intravenous contrast.
2. Extensive debridement of the left shoulder region with
resection of the
lateral clavicle in the interval since the prior procedure.
Swelling of the left latissimus dorsi and abnormal
low-attenuation material extending between the surgical bed and
this region.
3. Multifocal pulmonary nodules may reflect focal pneumonia;
however, followup CT when the patient's clinical condition
improves is recommended to ensure resolution.
4. A cluster of small cavitary lesions in the left lung are
difficult to
assess given the collapsed state of the lung. No convincing
evidence of an
abscess, although assessment is limited due to the lack of
intravenous contrast.
5. New small volume ascites.

CT Chest [**2131-1-26**]:
1. Significant decrease in multiloculated left pleural effusion
with chest
tube in place. Moderate pleural effusion has mildly increased in
size in
comparison to prior study.
2. Multiple bilateral multifocal pulmonary opacities
representative of
multifocal pneumonia have decreased in size.
3. Marked improvement in aeration of the left upper lobe.
4. Extensive debridement at the left shoulder region with
resection of the
left lateral clavicle is again noted along with swelling of the
left
latissimus dorsi. However, the extent of swelling has decreased
in comparison to prior study.

Pleural fluid from thoracentesis [**2131-1-27**]:
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Reactive mesothelial cells, histiocytes, neutrophils, and
lymphocytes

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7049**] was initially accepted by the [**Hospital 18**] Medical ICU in the
early hours of [**2131-1-13**] upon transfer from the OSH.  Recognizing
that the CT read indicated subcutaneous gas along with its
infectious etiology, surgery was consulted immediately and he
was taken to the operating room for operative debridement.  In
the OR, he was a difficult intubation and there was difficulty
in securing the airway, prompting an emergency
cricothyroidotomy.  He underwent extensive debridement of the
soft tissues of his left shoulder and was taken back to the
Trauma Surgical ICU post-operatively, no pressors and broad
spectrum antibiotics.

In the morning, the anesthesia/ICU/ACS team opted to convert his
perc cricothyrotomy to an endotracheal intubation with the use
of a pediatric bronchoscope and glide scope.  Orthopaedics and
ENT were consulted and he returned to the OR with orthopaedics,
ENT and ACS later that morning for further debridement of his
left shoulder extending distally to his forearm and proximally
up his left neck.  Please see the operative notes for additional
details.

Over the coming days, he returned to the OR on [**1-14**] and then
[**1-16**] with ENT, Ortho and ACS for further debridements.  His
wound appeared to be improving with less necrotic tissue and
overall improved vascularity and from [**1-16**] until [**1-23**], his wound
care was managed at bedside with once to twice daily dressing
changes along with debridement as necessary.  With the wound
healing well, on [**1-23**] he was taken to the OR with ENT for
conversion of his ETT to a tracheostomy and closure of his neck
wound.  On [**2131-1-25**] he returned to the OR for final debridement
and placement of a wound VAC over the shoulder.  Following this
debridement he was noted to have an empyema on the L side, he
was taken to the OR by thoracic surgery on [**2131-1-31**] for a washout
and decortication.  His final chest tube was removed on [**2131-2-3**].
