Brief Hospital Course:
Rhythm: After admission, the patient went into Afib with RVR
rates up to 150s, SBP as low as 50s, which could have
contributed to his worsening failure. The amiodarone that the
patient was maintained on as an outpatient was discontinued due
to side effect of ataxia.  Metoprolol was increased and he was
maintained on dopamine and natrecor for 6 days, diuresing well,
maintaining MAP's > 55, and HR's between 80-120.  When
stabilized, EP was [**Month/Day/Year 4221**] and inpatient AV junction ablation
with permanent biventricular pacing was performed on [**2161-9-21**].
Due to his persistent atrial fibrillation, and akinetic apex on
echo, heparin and warfarin 5 po qhs was started
prophylactically. His INR prior to discharge was 1.5, so he was
bridged with lovenox and will have close laboratory follow up.
*
Pump: The paitent has a history of failure with an EF of 25%.
The patient wwas admitted in decompensated CHF, with unclear
causes, possibly due to suboptimal filing due to his atrial
fibrillation and diet non-compliance, or worsening renal
function leading to failure of oupt diuresis.  Transiently, he
decompensated further, evidenced by increased pulm edema on CXR
and worsening MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on echo despite support with dopamine
and natrecor. As tolerated by his kidneys, he was aggressively
diuresed with lasix and chlorthiazide, responding well with
urine output and without further increase in his creatinine. It
is likely that the EP procedure improved renal perfusion, so he
was discharged home on torsemide 80 mg po qd and with specific
instructions on salt and fluid restriction.
*
Coronaries: The patient is s/p CABG, He was ruled out for an
ischemic event by EKG and serial enzymes.  Echo showed EF of
25%, 4+TR, 3+MR, akinetic apex. The patient was continued on asa
81mg, lipitor 20mg, toprol XL 12.5mg PO. Lisinopril was held
during the patient's stay in the hospital, due to elevated Cr
and labile BP's, but was restarted prior to discharge home.
*
Anemia: unclear etiology, probably mixed Fe deficiency and
anemica of chronic disease.  will have low threshold to
transfuse. Iron supplementation should be considered as an
outpatient when the patient is stable.
*
CRI: patient had a hx of CRI and came in with a Cr of of 2.2, up
from his baseline closer to 1.5. He was supported with dopamine
and natrecor which improved his creatinine.It also improved with
post-procedure. A chem 7 will be checked at close follow up.
*
GI: patient was constipated throughout his stay.  aggressive
bowel regiment was started and maintained at discharge.
Outpatient f/u for constipation is recommended.  patient was
discharged home on lactulose, dulcolax and colace.
*
GU: patient had significant penile and scrotal edema and BPH on
finasteride and tamsulosin. during the hospital stay, the
patient developed an Enterococci UTI, sensitive to levaquin and
was treated with a 10 day course of abx. during admission, foley
was placed, and patient developed hematuria due to traumatic
placement and clotted the foley off.  GU was called, and
recommended condom cath placement.  however patient's UOP
dropped, and foley was replaced wihtout incident. patient was
given pyridium to decrease bladder discomfort. After foley
removal, the patient was noted to have post-void residual volume
of 300 cc twice. The patient was observed to be continent and
able to urinate despite this. It was recommended to the family
that the patient be discharged with a foley catheter, but they
reported that they would prefer none since the patent has a
history of pulling the catheter, with copious bleeding because
of anticoagulation. They were instructed to look for specific
warning signs of retention, and will have follow up with Urology
in less than 1 week.
*
Dementia: The patient had significant sundowning in the
hospital. He was placed with a 1:1 sitter. It was felt that the
major reason was probably due to being in an unfamiliar
surroundings and the language barrier. He had one episode of
threatening the sitter with closed fists, for which haldol 2.5mg
IV was given which making the patient more confused. The family
got involved and threatened legal action if anti-psychotics are
used for this patient, and came in to spend nights with the
patient. Risk management, geriatrics and a social worker were
involved and recommended no haldol, close follow-up with family.
The family agreed to olanzipine for emergency situations.
*
Back pain: Pt has chronic back pain, and was maintained on home
pain regiment of oxycontin.
*
Skin: patient developed venous ulcer on his R leg and a pressure
ulcer on his sacrum, as well as a skin tear of his right arm.
Wound care nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4221**] and the ulcers improved prior to
discharge.  He will have visiting nurse assistance with wound
care.
*
Access: A PICC was placed during hospitalization and removed
prior to discharge.
*
Code: Full code during admission, confirmed with family.
