[**2101-10-27**] CT abdomen: In the upper abdomen, there is a large
heterogenous mass consistent with confluent adenopathy measuring
up to 9.4 x 7.8 cm. It surrounds the aorta and celiac axis with
tethering of the left gastric artery. A 3.1 x 1.9 cm periportal
node is also seen.
1. Large heterogenous splenic mass. Heterogenous bulky
retroperitoneal adenopathy surrounding the aorta and celiac
artery. Areas of necrosis are seen. These findings are
concerning for lymphoma.

2. Left renal exophytic cyst. Possible right renal cyst.

[**2101-10-27**] Pathology: Overall, the findings are of a high grade,
non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma.  Given the high proliferation
fraction, the differential diagnosis includes a high grade
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma versus an atypical Burkitt
lymphoma.
        Cytology: Overall, findings are of a high-grade
CD10-positive B-cell lymphoma. Differential includes atypical
Burkitt's vs large B-cell lymphoma.

[**2100-10-28**] CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:

1) Right hilar lymphadenopathy measuring 17 mm in diameter, as
well as slight prominence other bilateral hilar nodes. In the
clinical setting of lymphoma, involvement of lymphoma in the
right hilar nodes is suspected. Correlative FDG PET or gallium
imaging may be helpful.
2) Calcified subcarinal node, with multiple calcified
granulomas, representing prior granulomatous infection.
3) Non-calcified pulmonary nodule measuring less than 5 mm in
diameter, as described above, probably related to the prior
granulomatous infection, however, please follow up these lesions
on future CT scans.
4) Gynecomastia.
5) Interval development of small amount ascites, measuring 43
Hounsfielunits, which raises the possibility of hemoperitoneum
following recent biopsy.

[**2100-10-28**]: TTE:
Conclusions:
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal
(LVEF>55%).
3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is
no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mitral
regurgitation
is seen.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2100-10-29**]: bone marrow biopsy-
Normocellular marrow for age with multiple lymphoid aggregates

[**2100-11-4**]: CT abdomen: There has been interval decrease in the
size of the splenic lesion. Previously, it measured 11.5 x 11.1
cm and now measures 10.0 x 8.6 cm. It is now more heterogeneous
in appearance with low attenuation areas consistent with
necrosis. Small amount of higher attenuation fluid is noted at
the inferior margin of the spleen consistent with peri-splenic
hematoma. The retroperitoneal mass of bulky adenopathy involving
the proximal abdominal aorta and left diaphragm has also
decreased in size. Previously, it measured 9.4 x 7.8 cm and now
measures 7.6 x 6.6 cm. Areas of low attenuation are also seen
consistent with necrosis.

[**2100-11-16**]: Gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies, two:
A.  Esophagus:
1.  Active esophagitis, with ulceration.
2.  No viral inclusions or tumor seen.
3.  Methenamine silver stain of the esophagus (slide A) is
negative for fungi, with satisfactory control.
.

B.  Duodenum:
1.  Acute duodenitis, with multiple crypt abscesses and focal
loss
of villi.
2.  No viral inclusions or tumor seen.
3.  Immunostain of the duodenum (slide B) is negative for
cytomegalovirus, with satisfactory control. Some reagents are
not approved for diagnostic use.
Note:  Possible causes of the duodenal inflammation include
infection and drug injury.

[**2100-11-18**]:CT abdomen: Gallbladder is slightly prominent but
demonstrates no secondary signs of cholecystitis. There is a
stable appearing,predominantly hypodense lesion within the
spleen measuring 8.2 x 7.0 cm. This appears unchanged in size
and appearance in the interval. A large paraesophageal soft
tissue mass measures 6.5 x 5.5 cm and is grossly unchanged in
appearance as well. Pancreas and adrenal glands are normal in
appearance

[**2100-11-23**]: CT sinus: IMPRESSION: Minimal ethmoid sinus thickening.
Evidence of prior right maxillary surgery. Otherwise, negative
study.

[**2100-11-27**]: CT abdomen:IMPRESSION
1. No evidence for splenic, perisplenic, or intra-abdominal
hemorrhage.
2. Unchanged size and appearance of the splenic hypodense
lesion, and peri- splenic fluid collection.
3. Unchanged soft tissue mass in the lesser sac, which is
presumably a mass of matted lymph nodes.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 56 yo male with Burkitt's lymphoma.

#Burkitt's Lymphoma - The patient presented to the [**Location 1268**]
VA with 5-6 day history of LUQ pain and constipation. A CT scan
at WR was notable for lymphadenopathy concerning for neoplastic
disease. A repeat CT abdomen on admission was notable for
extensive LAD, splenomegaly with a splenic lesion. On [**2101-10-27**],
CT guided core biopsy of spleen was notable for B cell lymphoma
- DLBL vs Burkitts. CT chest was done for staging which was
notable for enlarged R hilum LN. He then had a baseline TTE
which suggested an LVEF of >55%. A bone marrow biopsy was done
which suggested T cell dominant lymphoid profile. There was a
small population of CD10 co-expressing B cells; given the known
history of a CD10
