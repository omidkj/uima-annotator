Brief Hospital Course:
     50yo M admitted initially to the medicine service for
work-up of his newly-dx'd BL renal masses, concerning for
malignancy.  His platelet count dropped during the time of his
transfer, presumably from HIT although the one assay performed
here was negative.  For this reason his anticoagulation was
switched to Argatroban and carefully titrated to effectively
anticoagulate for his mechanical valve; his platelet count
normalized.  He remained as an inpatient during this complicated
work-up period.
     The pathology report from [**Hospital6 **] revealed
Renal Cell Carcinoma.  A metastatic work-up with Head CT, Chest
CT, Abd-Pelvic CT, and Bone scan was negative except for an
adrenal mass whose density was not consistent with benign
adenoma.  (MRI could not be performed due to his AICD).  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] from Urology planned a two-stage resection; first a
right-partial and then a left-total.  Cardiac clearance was
obtained with a combination of studies from [**Hospital1 18**] and [**Hospital **]; an echo here showed EF 20-30% and he was maintained on
beta-blocker.  He did develop LUE swelling but U/S and CT were
negative for DVT.  He was maintained on therapeutic argatroban
and transitioned successfully to coumadin.  EP-Cardiology was
contact[**Name (NI) **] regarding deactivating his AICD.  He underwent a bowel
prep on the day prior to surgery.
     A right partial nephrectomy was performed on [**1-4**] while on
coumadin.  See operative report for details.  He was placed in
the ICU post-operatively for close hemodynamic monitoring in
light of his complicated cardiac history; he remained intubated
with a swan-ganz catheter, chest tube, JP drain, NG tube, and
Foley catheter.  He was extubated without complication on POD 1.
 On POD 2 the chest tube was removed, CXR showed minimal PTX.
The NG tube was removed on POD 3.  He was transfused 1 Unit
PRBCs for anemia (Hct 27).  He remained in the ICU for
observation related to mobilizing fluid and concern for volume
overload given his compromised cardiac output.  It was noted
that he developed a contact dermatitis, presumably from the tape
during surgical positioning; this resolved after several days
with topical cream for comfort.  He remained stable and was
transferred to the regular floor on POD 4 after the swan-ganz
was changed over a wire to a triple-lumen catheter.
     At this time he was passing regular flatus and given a
regular (cardiac) diet.  His pain control was transitioned to PO
dilaudid.  His HCT remained low and he received a 2nd Unit of
PRBCs.  The JP drain was removed on POD 5.  His INR was closely
checked throughout his post-operative course with dosage
decreased during immediate post-op period (Inr 2.8-3.2); it rose
to 3.8 and 3.9 with dosage decreased.  After beginning PO
intake, the INR dropped significantly to 3.4 then 2.1 over 12
hours and then 1.5.  His dose meanwhile had been increased to
7.5 qhs.  He was resumed on his usual home medications.  The
Foley was removed on POD 6 and the triple-lumen catheter on POD
7.  At the time of discharge he was urinating independently,
tolerating PO diet and pain moderately controlled on PO meds.
