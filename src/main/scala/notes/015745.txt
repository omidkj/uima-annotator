Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 371**]
Chief Complaint:
Syncopal episode with a fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**12-24**] Exploratory laparotomy, duodenotomy, oversewn duodenal
ulcer, pyloroplasty, placement of gastrostomy, and jejunostomy

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year old Vietnamese speaking female who presented
to [**Hospital1 18**]-ED via ambulance on [**12-23**] after sustaining a syncopal
episode with loss of consciousness and a fall with a head
trauma. She has a history of a known duodenal ulcer with a UGIB
[**9-8**] and CAD s/p NSTEMI; she was found to have melena by rectal
exam and NG lavage revealed coffee ground contents; she was
hypotensive with improvement after fluid resuscitation,
hematocrit was 28.4 which was down from her baseline of 35. A
central venous line was placed, CT scan of the head demonstrated
small subdural hematoma with subacrachnoid hemorrhage; CT
C-spine showed C5-C6 inferanterior avulsion fracture with disc
retropulsion. She was transferred to the surgical intensive care
unit for further treatment.

Pertinent Results:
Operative Note:
Exploratory laparotomy, duodenotomy
with oversewing of bleeding duodenal ulcer, Finney closure of
duodenotomy, gastrostomy, tube placement and jejunostomy tube
placement.

CT L-spine [**12-23**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture or dislocation

CT T-spine [**12-23**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of thoracic spine fracture.
2. Slight stranding in the right upper abdominal quadrant,
probably an artifactual appearance due to motion. However,
correlation with abdominal examination is recommended, in the
setting of recent trauma.

CT C-spine
IMPRESSION:
1. Possible minimally displaced anteroinferior fracture at C5,
with probable associated soft tissue swelling, v. unfused
osteophyte.
2. Probable C5/6 disc protrusion- if there are myelopathic
symptoms, a follow-up MR study is advised.
3. 4mm lytic lesion in the dens, of unclear significance.
Particularly if there is a history of prior malignancy,
radionuclide bone scan could be helpful in further evaluation of
this finding.

CT head [**12-23**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Small subdural hematoma along the falx cerebri with adjacent
foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
2. Soft tissue swelling and subgaleal hematoma overlying the
left parietal region.
3. Tiny hypodense foci near the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction in
the right frontal lobe- see above report. MRI could be helpful,
when clinically feasible to evaluate further.

CT head [**12-23**]:
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change in the appearance of
the brain since [**2169-12-23**] at 9:47 a.m. Stable parafalcine subdural
hematoma, and small right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage. No
mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.

MR Cervical spine:
IMPRESSION:
1. Minimal central disc protrusion at C5-6 level, without
significant neural foraminal or central canal stenosis at this
or other levels and without signal abnormality in the underlying
spinal cord.
2. No prevertebral soft tissue hematoma or evidence of
ligamentous injury.
3. Findings consistent with a hemangioma within the dens,
corresponding to lytic lesion seen on the CT of [**2169-12-23**].

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2169-12-23**]  8:30:24 AM
Sinus rhythm. Slight non-specific ST segment elevation in leads
V1-V4 with
biphasic and inverted T waves. Cannot exclude ischemia. Compared
to the
previous tracing of [**2169-9-20**] the ST-T wave changes are new.

Intervals Axes
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T
79 136 74 420/454.42 70 52 81

CT head [**12-25**]:
IMPRESSION: Unchanged subarachnoid and subdural blood.
No new intracranial hemorrhage.
Soft tissue edema within the scalp is new from the prior
examination and likely is secondary to the patient's volume
status after the recent surgery.

Echo [**12-25**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the
septum and
anterior walls. The apex is mildly dyskinetic. A left
ventricular
mass/thrombus cannot be excluded - vs. artifact vs.
trabeculation. The
remaining left ventricular segments contract normally. Right
ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-9-19**],
an apical
thrombus vs. trabeculation is now suggested. Left ventricular
systolic
dysfunction is more pronounced (anterior wall and apex).
If clinically indicated, a follow-up study with echo contrast
may be able to
better define the possible apical left ventricular thrombus.

Conclusions:
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with
focal hypokinesis of the distal septum and anterior wall, and
apex. No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.

Echo [**1-1**]:
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-12-25**], left
ventricular
dysfunction is improved and the apical abnormality is now better
defined as a
trabeculation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro: neurologically intact, cervical collar was placed and
will need to be worn for a total of 6 weeks, will need to
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] from neurosurgery in 6 weeks for a
C-spine CT scan.
Experienced hyponatremia secondary to cerebral salt wasting on
POD 7, sodium 120, treated with hypertonic solution with
correction in 24 hours to a serum sodium of 134.

CV: Cardiac enzymes positive for ischemia, cardiology consult
placed, echo done [**12-25**] with findings compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2169-9-19**], an apical  thrombus vs.
trabeculation is now suggested. Left ventricular systolic
dysfunction is more pronounced (anterior wall and apex);
beta-blockade was continued, diuresis with Lasix administered
secondary to fluid overload initially post-operatively, started
on an Ace inhibitor, Aspirin, and Lipitor on POD 4.
Repeat echo demonstrated improved and the apical abnormality is
now better defined as a trabeculation, no evidence of thrombus.

Pulm: Extubated post-operatively without difficulty, oxygenating
well on nasal cannula, at time of discharge was ambulating with
minimal assistance and oxygenating well on room air.

GI: EGD done [**12-24**] demonstrated pulsatile arterial bleeding in
second portion of duodenum, gastric ulcer along less curvature;
she was taken to the operating room and underwent an exploratory
laparotomy, duodenotomy, oversewn duodenal ulcer, pyloroplasty,
placement of gastric and jejunostomy tubes.
Proton pump inhibitors drip started upon admission, changed to
twice a day dosing post-operati
