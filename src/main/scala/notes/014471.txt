Date of Birth:  [**2068-2-6**]             Sex:   M

Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Ambien

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4748**]
Chief Complaint:
Bilateral foot ulcerations, he was admitted in anticipation of
angiography under general anesthesia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right lower extremity angiography


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 79 year old man with a history of CHF (EF
20-30%), s/p CABG w/ subsequent stent to LAD and RCA, COPD on
home O2, and history of L SFA-peroneal bypass with non-reversed
saphenous vein graft in [**2137**] who is seen in vascular surgery
consultation with bilateral foot ulceration.  He previously
underwent non-invasvive arterial studies demonstrating severe
bilateral tibial disease R>L with flat waveforms distal to his
calf.

He underwent diagnostic angio on [**2147-7-13**] with the following
conclusions: Extensive atherosclerotic changes of the right
femoral and popliteal segments.  There is a significant
common femoral stenosis.  Abrupt occlusion of the below-knee
popliteal artery with reconstitution of the proximal
peroneal.  This tibioperoneal trunk occlusion may be amenable
to endovascular recanalization but would require general
anesthetic to prevent the patient motion.

He is admitted today in anticipation of angio under general
anesthesia tomorrow.

Echo [**2147-7-27**]
The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely
dilated. There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with septal akinesis, and inferior and
anterior hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] There is considerable beat-to-beat
variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an
irregular rhythm/premature beats. The right ventricular cavity
is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The diameters
of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2147-6-13**], the
detected pulmonary artery hypertension is lower; the image
quality is better with better delineation of wall motion
abnormalities. The overall ejection fraction is similar.

Venous Duplex [**2147-7-28**]
Duplex and color Doppler demonstrate patency of the greater
saphenous veins bilaterally. Please note that the right greater
saphenous
vein is diminutive below the knee.

The basilic and cephalic veins are patent bilaterally. Note that
there is
thrombus within the left basilic vein in the antecubital fossa.


Angio [**2151-7-24**]
Patent right common femoral artery.
Patent right profunda. Patent SFA. Patent above-knee [**Doctor Last Name **].
Patent below-knee [**Doctor Last Name **].

With all the aforementioned, there were multiple heavy
calcifications throughout but this was not flow-limiting.

The AT was totally occluded.

The tibioperoneal trunk was occluded to the upper one third
of the peroneal artery. The peroneal artery was fed by
collaterals from above from the upper one third to the foot.
It was widely patent.

The proximal portion of the PT to about the level of the calf
was occluded. Again collaterals from blood filled the distal
PT.

Vessels into the foot:  The PT was patent. It did fill the
medial and lateral plantars.

The tibial peroneal trunk did reconstitute to fill the
dorsalis pedis. The dorsalis pedis did fill the medial and
lateral plantar tarsals.

The foot vessels were very small in caliber.


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**7-23**], v/c/f, mucomyst and bicarb

[**7-24**] angio cancelled

[**7-26**] went for angio, unable to pass tibioperoneal trunk on right
hypotensive to SBP 70s after angio, landed up in the ICU briefly
but no pressors required, only fluid boluses

[**7-28**] venous duplex (vein mapping) shows basilic and cephalic
veins are patent bilaterally, thrombus within the left basilic
vein in the antecubital fossa
