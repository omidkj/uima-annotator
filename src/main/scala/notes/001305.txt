Admission Date:  [**2167-12-29**]              Discharge Date:   [**2168-1-7**]

Date of Birth:  [**2105-6-4**]             Sex:   F

Service: [**Year (4 digits) 662**]

Allergies:
Haldol / Darvon / Keppra

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1674**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status, ? hematemesis
.
PCP: ?Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Hospital1 **] Community Health

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
central venous line attempt
arterial line

History of Present Illness:
62yoF with h/o EtOH/Hep C cirrhosis, psychotic, seizure d/o
(none x many years), multiple admission for GI bleeds (portal
gastropathy, grade 4 rectal varices) who now presents from rehab
with altered mental status and ?hematemesis. She has been at
acute rehab from [**12-26**] and was reportedly doing well until early
this morning when she was found to be somnolent/lethargic. There
is some verbal report of perhaps hematemesis although amount and
frequency is unknown (not documented on transfer paperwork). She
was, thus, taken directly to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation and
management. Per verbal rehab report, she had been receiving all
of her medications as prescribed upon discharge; it is unclear
if she had been having regular BMs. No report of increased
cough, BRBPR, but additional ROS unclear.
.
Of note, she was admitted [**Date range (1) 99376**] for GI bleed. An EGD on
[**2167-12-19**] showed portal gastropathy only without any evidence of
active bleeding. There was no evidence of varices.
.
Prior to her most recent hospitalization, she was admitted
[**Date range (1) 99375**] for a signficant LGIB s/p TIPS at which time she
presented with black stools, lethargy, and confusion. Hospital
course in [**11/2167**] was complicated by respiratory failure [**2-13**] to
nosocomial pneumonia and pulmonary edema transiently requiring
intubation.
.
In the ED, initial vitals revealed T 101.2 BP 178/113 HR 137 RR
24 O2 sat 100%. She was noted to have BRB in her mouth without
any obvious source of bleed within the oral cavity. She was
noted to have altered mental status and was intubated for airway
protection in this setting. A CT head was performed and read is
pending. She received octreotide 50mcg IV x1, protonix 40mg IV
x1, vitamin K 10mg SC x1, 2 units of FFP. Additionally, she
received ceftazidime 1g IV x1, flagyl 500mg IV x1, and
vancomycin 1g IV x 1. It appears that blood culture x1 was
collected, but not UA/culture.
.
Abdominal U/S in the ED demonstrated interval decrease in the
proximal, mid and distal TIPS velocity, but did show normal
wall-to-wall flow was noted within the TIPS and the main portal
vein and its branches. The TIPS device demonstrates abnormal
pulsatile flow suggesting the presence of possible right heart
failure.
.
Pt admitted to the ICU [**1-1**] for further management of her
altered mental status (s/p intubation for airway protection),
SIRS and probable sepsis and ? GIB.  After uneventful 1d course
with improved MS (alert, oriented x2) pt transferred back to
floor [**1-2**].
.
ROS: Unable to obtain from patient.
