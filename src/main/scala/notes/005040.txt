[**11-15**] head CT:Multiple areas of punctate high density scattered
throughout the brain likely representing contusion. There is
loss of sulci and basal cisterns likely representative of
diffuse cerebral edema as well as focal edema around contusions.

spine
[**11-15**] CT torso:Bilateral pneumothoraces, right greater than left
status post placement of right-sided chest tube. Pulmonary
contusion. Linear area of low attenuation within the posterior
dome of the liver which is concerning for a small laceration.
Linear low density within the inferior tip of the spleen with
surrounding perisplenic fluid concerning for splenic laceration.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was stabilized in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, and was subsequently
sent for pan-CT scans.  The pt was evaluated by the neurosurgery
team as well as the orthopedic team.

Neuro: An intercranial bolt was placed, and was constantly
monitored.
The patient had hourly neurologic checks.  As the patient had
elevated ICPs, 3%NS was started.  The patient was transitioned
to pentobarbital drip and also had mannitol during her stay.
Her urine and serum electrolytes were monitored during mannitol
administration.   The patient's bolt was removed when
appropriate.  She also had surveillance CT scans as well as
MRI/MRAs.

CV: Serial echos were performed  as the patient initially had
severe hypotension.  Blood pressure was maintained, and the
patient was put on levophed.  The patient was gradually weanted
and her blood pressure controlled with pressors/beta-blockers as
needed.

Pulm: The patient was intubated and sedated throughout her stay.
 She had routine x-rays to evaluate for pneumonia or other acute
changes.  The patient received a tracheostomy as she was
ventilator dependent.  She was weaned from the vent and was able
to be weaned to a trach collar.  The patient also required a
chest tube for an expanding right sided pneumothorax.  The chest
tube was managed in the standard fashion and removed when
appropriate.

GI/GU:  The patient received tube feeds when appropriate during
her stay.  A PEG was placed as the patient would not tolerate
other PO intake.  When volume overloaded, the patient received
lasix (drip).  Her urine output was constantly monitored.

ENdo:  The patient was put on insulin (drip and sliding scale)
which was adjusted as necessary

ID:  The patient was routinely monitored for signs of infection,
and had cultures sent when she spiked fevers.  The patient was
put on antibiotics for ventilator associated pneumonia on [**11-21**].


Heme:  The patient's coagulation profiles and hematocrit were
routinely monitored; she was transfused as necessary to maintain
an adequate hematocrit.

Proph:  The patient was put on DVT and GI prophylaxis and an IVC
filter was placed/

The patient was discharged to rehab in stable condition.  Her
neurologic status had improved slightly during her stay.  She
does not follow commands, but moves purposefully at times.  She
moves all extremities, but her left side is slightly stronger.
She has a disconjugate gaze, but pupils are equal and reactive
at 3-4mm briskly.  She has a right sided facial droop, + cough
and + gag.  On discharge, the patient was tolerating tube feeds,
she was afebrile with stable vital signs.
