Service:  Medicine, [**Doctor Last Name **] Firm
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old
woman who, in [**2136**], had an 81.14-mm thick melanoma found on
her right posterior thigh.  In [**2142-3-8**], the patient had
a right inguinal area lymph node resected with positive
margins.  Between [**2142-4-7**] and [**2142-6-7**], the patient
from [**2142-4-7**] to [**2143-4-8**].  In [**2142-8-8**], a CT
of the chest showed a right upper lobe nodule.  In [**2143-8-9**], two more right upper lobe nodules were found.  In
[**2143-12-9**] a CT of the chest revealed left lower lobe
nodule, and in [**2144-3-8**] a CT revealed pancreatic lesions
times two, as well as new lesions in the left lower lobe and
right upper lobe.  Also noted was a subcutaneous mass in the
patient underwent COG and a [**Numeric Identifier 65163**] trial beginning on [**2144-5-11**].  On [**2144-6-22**], the patient reported cough and fever
and was started on Zithromax but continued to have a dry
cough and dyspnea on exertion.

One day prior to admission, the patient had fever to 100.
Her oxygen saturation was apparently checked at home and
found to be 91% on room air.  The patient was sent to the
Emergency Department for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Melanoma metastatic to lungs, pleura,
pancreas, axilla.  In [**2136**], status post resection of melanoma
from right posterior thigh.  In [**2142-3-8**], status post
right inguinal lymph node resection with positive margins.
Radiation therapy from [**2142-4-7**] through [**2142-6-7**].  In
[**2142-4-7**] through [**2143-4-8**], the patient received
interferon.  In [**2142-8-8**], right upper lobe lung
nodules were found.  In [**2143-12-9**] new nodules were
found in the left lower lobe.  In [**2144-3-8**] pancreatic
lesions were found.  In [**2144-4-7**] subcutaneous axillary
nodules were found.  The patient experienced femoral
neuropathy secondary to radiation therapy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  MSIR 24 st q.d., MS Contin p.o.
b.i.d. (the patient did not know dose).  In the Emergency
Department the patient received Levaquin 500 mg intravenously
times one, as well as Flagyl 500 mg intravenously times one,
and morphine 2 mg intravenously times two, and 4 mg
intravenously times two.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and smoked one to two
packs of cigarettes per day times 30 years; she quit in
[**2143-12-9**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's father died at the age of 67
of leukemia.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Complete blood count was
notable for a white blood cell count of 14.8, hematocrit
of 34, and platelets 636.  The patient's Chem-7 revealed a
sodium of 133, potassium of 4, chloride of 96, bicarbonate
of 18, BUN of 15, creatinine of 0.5, glucose of 112.  Anion
gap of 19.  Creatine kinase was 34, and troponin was 0.3.
INR was 1.3, PTT was 27.8, PT was 13.9.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  In general, the patient
was a cachectic ill-appearing female with moderate
respiratory distress.  Vital signs were as follows:
Temperature 97.6, heart rate 113, blood pressure 98/66,
breathing 20 times per minute.  HEENT revealed pupils were
equal, round, and reactive to light.  Oropharynx with dry
mucous membranes.  Neck revealed no jugular venous
distention.  Chest examination revealed pulmonary crackles at
the right anterior upper field as well as decreased breath
sounds and tubular sounds in the left side.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed tachycardia with no murmurs heard.
Heart sounds were clear.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended, positive bowel sounds, positive subcutaneous
nodule in the right upper quadrant.  Extremities were without
edema.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Other studies on admission included chest
CT from [**7-8**] revealed extensive lymphadenopathy in the
right axilla, especially in the superior region.  There was a
right hilar, and pretracheal, and precarinal lymphadenopathy;
left-sided pleural effusion approximately halfway up the
field; slight right shift of the mediastinum; right upper
lobe pneumonia; right pleural based nodules; left lower lobe
complete collapse.

Chest x-ray on [**7-8**] revealed a new left-sided effusion as
noted above, right high-powered border with questionable
border.

Electrocardiogram of [**2144-7-8**], revealed sinus
tachycardia with a heart rate of 133, right bundle-branch
block pattern with loss of R waves anteriorly, low voltages.
Compared with [**2144-4-7**], the right bundle-branch block was
new, and the voltages were significantly lower.


HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the O-MED
Service on [**2144-7-8**], due to her dyspnea and elevated
temperatures at home.  As noted above, CT and chest x-ray
revealed multiple pulmonary nodules, as well as a large
left-sided pleural effusion, and right upper lobe pneumonia.
The patient was started on levofloxacin and Flagyl, and
underwent 2-liter thoracentesis.  Electrocardiogram showed
low voltage.  Echocardiogram revealed pericardial effusion
with sustained right atrium and diastolic right ventricular
collapse.

Thus, the patient underwent a 350-cc pericardiocentesis and
was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit with a pigtail
drain.  The drain was discontinued on [**2144-7-11**], without
any complications.  The patient's condition continued to wane
despite her antibiotics and pleurocentesis and
pericardiocentesis.

The patient's husband did not want the patient to have home
hospice secondary to concerns about the patient and her
husband's children being at home.  The husband, thus,
preferred inpatient hospice.  The patient and the patient's
family changed the patient's status to DNR/DNI on [**2144-7-10**], and she was made comfort measures only.  All
medications and monitoring were discontinued except for
morphine and Ativan.  The patient was transferred to the
medical floor on [**2144-7-13**].

On the morning of [**2144-7-14**], the cross-covering house
officer was called to evaluate the patient for lack of
spontaneous respirations.  The house officer found the
patient to be without spontaneous respirations, and without
spontaneous heart beats, as well as to have fixed and dilated
pupils bilaterally.  The patient was thus pronounced dead on
the morning of [**2144-7-14**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Widely metastatic melanoma.
2.  Status post radiation therapy.
3.  Status post chemotherapy.
4.  Pneumonia.












CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient, as noted above, was
pronounced dead on the morning of [**2144-7-14**].
