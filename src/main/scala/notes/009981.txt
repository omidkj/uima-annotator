Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute liver transplant rejection.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Internal jugular transvenous liver biopsy.

History of Present Illness:
60 year-old female status post liver transplant for Hepatitis C,
ESRD secondary to MPGN, and congestive heart failure who
presents directly after liver biopsy performed [**10-13**] for
elevated liver function tests was consistent with acute

chills, or night sweats. Denied abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, melena/BRBPR.

The patient's last liver biopsy [**1-/2151**] at OSH revealed grade 3
inflammation and stage 2 fibrosis. EGD done at that time showed
candidal esophagitis. Colonoscopy was normal.
.
ROS: As above. Denied headache, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denied
chest pain, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND. No

Brief Hospital Course:
60 year-old female with past medical history of HCV cirrhosis
status post liver transplant in [**2149**], congestive heart failure
with history of flash pulmonary edema requiring MICU transfer
x2, ESRD on HD who initially presented on [**10-13**] with a liver
biopsy consistent with acute rejection.
.
1. Liver transplant with acute rejection: The patient is status
post OLT [**2150-7-8**] in [**State 8449**] for Hepatitis C cirrhosis.
Biopsy on admission showed moderate acute cellular rejection
with central venulitis and increased portal fibrosis with early
septa formation, (Stage 2). The patient received solumedrol for
five days. The patient was restarted on cellcept. The patient's
tacrolimus was dosed for goal trough level [**5-6**]. Repeat liver
biopsy prior to discharge status post the above treatment showed
no features of acute cellular rejection and minimal portal
mononuclear inflammation, non-specific. The patient was
discharged home on cellcept [**Pager number **] mg twice daily and tacrolimus 3
mg twice daily. The patient will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] at the
transplant center.
.
2. Respiratory distress/flash pulmonary edema: Resolved prior to
discharge. The patient had two episodes of flash pulmonary edema
requiring transfer to the MICU. Per OSH records, the patient has
a history of flash pulmonary edema secondary to poor blood
pressure control and fluid overload. COPD likely contributed to
the patient's respiratory distress. Cardiology was consulted and
adjusted the patient's anti-hypertensive regimen as below. The
patient was started on advair and nebulizer treatments as
needed. The patient received hemodialysis per schedule for fluid
balance.
.
3. ESRD on HD: Secondary to MPGN. The patient was followed by
renal throughout admission. The patient was dialyzed per
schedule. The patient was continued on
calcium acetate and nephrocaps. The patient underwent vein
mapping for placement of an AV fistula and will be followed by
transplant surgery.
.
4. Hypertension: The patient was followed by cardiology during
admission. The patient was briefly on nitro gtt for blood
pressure control while in the MICU. The patient's
anti-hypertensive regimen was modified and the patient was
discharged on Metoprolol 100 mg q8h, Lisinopril 40 mg [**Hospital1 **],
Amlodipine 10 mg qd, Hydralazine 50 mg q6h and Imdur 30 mg qd.
The patient received hemodialysis per schedule for fluid
balance.
.
5. Thrombocytopenia and anemia: Likely secondary to end-stage
liver disease and end-stage renal disease, respectively. The
patient's hematocrit and platelet count remained stable
throughout hospitalization. The patient had no signs or symptoms
of active bleeding during admission.
.
6. Diabetes: The patient was followed by [**Last Name (un) **] during
admission. The patient's glipizide and metformin were held. The
patient was discharged on standing Glargine 14 units at bedtime
with a sliding scale provided.
.
7. Coronary artery disease/congestive heart failure: The patient
was followed by cardiology. The patient had no complaints of
chest pain during admission. The patient's troponins remained
flat around 0.06. The patient has a history of catheterization
showing mild disease performed in [**State 48158**] for flash pulmonary
edema. The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 **]
[**2152-9-15**] with flash pulmonary edema; work-up included
pharmacologic stress test which shows small, mild, reversible
anterior defect. Ejection fraction 60% on echocardiogram [**10-2**].
The patient was continued on aspirin, beta-blocker,
ACE-inhibitor, plavix, and Imdur. The patient is not on a statin
given her liver function.
.
8. Hepatitis C: Refractory to treatment. Stable.
