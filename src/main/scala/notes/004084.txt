Brief Hospital Course:
89 year old male with PMH significant for chronic lymphocytic
leukemia, IDDM, CAD s/p CABG ([**2141**]) who is transferred from
[**Hospital **] hospital for PPM for symptomatic bradycardia.

# Symptomatic Bradycardia: Patient's fall was suspected to be
secondary to symptomatic bradyarrhythmia.  His ECG from the OSH
showed Wenckebach and CHB. Per report, as an outpatient patient
had sinus pauses on Holter monitor.  Patient underwent placement
of PPM and tolerated this procedure well.  He was treated with
antibiotics for 48hours.  His pacemaker was interrogated and
working well.  Patient will follow up in device clinic next
week. Please see page 1 for pacer site care and activity
restrictions.
.
# Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction:  Patient has a history
of CABG (anatomy unknown).  His cardiac markers were elevated at
OSH and at [**Hospital1 18**].  While here he denied any chest pain.  Patient
was limited to receiving anti-aggregation therapy (see below).
He was started on lisinopril, metoprolol after PPM was placed,
ASA 325.  Lipitor was started at discharge. His lipid panel is
pending at this time. There was a discussion at discharge about
persuing stress testing but given his CLL, it was thought that
medical management was most appropriate at this time.
.
# Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease: Patient's Cr was 1.6 at OSH.
His urine was notable for large blood and there was a concern
for rhabdo.  On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] patient's Cr was 1.4, which
remained stable.  He also had protein in his urine which
suggested likely underlying renal insufficiency likely secondary
to diabetes.  His metformin and glipizide were held, but
restarted on discharge.
.
# CLL: With likely bone marrow involvement: thrombocytopenia and
anemia.  ANC 2150.  His counts were monitored and procrit was
held. Platelets decreased to 64 on day of discharge, Hct stable
at 30. No signs of overt bleeding. Given the patient will not be
able to f/u with his home Hematologist (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 12795**] in [**Location (un) **]
VT) an appt was made wth Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for further
monitoring. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will decide when to restart Procrit and
arrange for monitoring of labs. FeSo4 was continued. Please
check labs on Monday [**7-25**].
.
# IDDM: Held metformin and glipizide, but restarted on
discharge.  Patient continued on home lantus.
.
#  BPH: Continued terazosin
.
# Thyroid nodule: An incidental thyroid nodule was seen on CT
scan, which needs to be followed as an outpatient.
.
# S/P Mohs Surgery for Squamous Cell CA on scalp on [**7-14**]. His
daughter has been changing the dressing daily. Sutures can be
removed on [**7-26**], then a non-occlusive dressing to the site until
there is only pink skin visible.
