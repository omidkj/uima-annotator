Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5868**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsive.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-S/p angiogram with intraarterial tPA to basilar artery, left
vertebral artery angioplasty
-S/p angiogram with left vertebral artery stent
-S/p tracheostomy
-S/p PEG placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 39 year old male who was admitted on [**2155-11-10**]. He
has a past medical history of hypertension (since early 20's)
and [**3-13**] week history of headaches, blurry vision, followed by
one day history on [**2155-11-10**] of HA, blurry vision, slurred speech
and loss of consciousness with persistent unresponsiveness. He
was taken initially to [**Hospital **] Hospital. His initial vitals were
98.6 HR 94 BP 150/83 O2Sat 90% (on 100% oxygen). He was sedated,
paralyzed and intubated there. Non-contrast head CT showed high
density in
distal basilar artery suspicious for acute thrombosis. He was
medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. On arrival, his GCS
was 3.  T 99.6, HR 80 SBP 140-160.  On initial exam, he was
unresponsive, no corneals, no gag, no withdrawal to noxious
stimuli. Emergent angiogram was done and showed left vertebral
stenosis and basilar artery occlusion. He received intraarterial
tPA and angioplasty of left vertebral was done with
recannulization of basilar flow. Possible etiologies of basilar
occlusion included embolic event, dissection,
atherosclerotic disease or other vasculopathy. After angiogram,
his neuro exam remained unchanged. He was admitted to the
neurology stroke service for further management.

CT head without contrast [**2155-11-10**]: This study was performed
after an angiogram and there is intravascular contrast present.
There is also patchy hyperdensity within the body of the pons,
more on the right than the left, which may indicate enhancement
and infarction or hemorrhage. The pons appears somewhat
expanded. There is slightly decreased attenuation of the
cerebellar parenchyma, superiorly on the left. The fourth
ventricle is midline. The lateral and third ventricles are not
dilated. The cerebrum has a normal appearance. There is mucosal
thickening and some fluid in the paranasal sinuses. IMPRESSION:
History of basilar artery thrombosis. Enhancement or hemorrhage
in the pons indicates some degree of infarction. There is also
questionable left superior cerebellar attenuation
abnormality/infarction.
-----
MRA neck [**2155-11-11**]: FINDINGS: Within the proximal left vertebral
artery, there is an area of moderate, irregular stenosis. This
corresponds geographically with an abnormality seen on the prior
angiograms. No bright signal is seen in this region on the T1W
images to suggest the presence of methemoglobin. IMPRESSION:
Signal abnormality in the region of the proximal left vertebral
artery, which may relate to the presence of clot, rather than
dissection in this region. This area of obstruction was also
noted on the angiogram from [**2155-11-10**], though at that time
the vessel appeared largely occluded at this point.
-----
MRI head/MRA head [**2155-11-11**]: FINDINGS: There is increased T2
signal within the body of the pons. There is also a large area
of T2 signal hyperintensity involving the left cerebellum with a
small component in the inferior cerebellum and a larger
component in the mid and superior portions of the cerebellar
hemisphere. The medulla and midbrain have normal signal
intensity. The basal ganglia and thalami have normal signal
intensity, as does the cerebrum. Ventricular size is normal.
Gradient echo images demonstrate susceptibility artifact in the
midpons which probably indicates hemorrhage. MR [**First Name (Titles) 4058**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4579**]s a small right vertebral artery which appears to
terminate as the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. At this
time, there is continuous flow signal in the left intracranial
vertebral artery and basilar artery. There is also flow signal
in the proximal portions of the posterior cerebral and superior
cerebellar arteries. Flow signal is observed within both
intracranial internal carotid arteries and in the anterior and
middle cerebral arterial branches. The right posterior
communicating artery is visualized. The left posterior
communicating artery and A1 segments are not seen. There appears
to be flow to both anterior cerebral arteries through the right
A1. The anterior communicating artery has a normal appearance.
IMPRESSION: 1. MRI of the brain demonstrates infarction of the
pons and left cerebellum. There is also a suggestion of a small
amount of hemorrhage within the midpons. 2. MRA of the circle of
[**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates restoration of flow within the left
vertebral and basilar artery. There is also flow in the proximal
portions of the posterior circulation and in the major branches
of the anterior circulation.
-----
TEE [**2155-11-11**]: The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. Peak LAA blood velocity was
normal (>20).
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D,
color Doppler or saline contrast at rest x 2. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending,
transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter
and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: No definite
cardiac source of embolism indentified.
