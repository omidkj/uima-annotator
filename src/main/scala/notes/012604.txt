Chief Complaint:
Chest pain/Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2171-3-21**] - Coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels (Left
internal mammary->Left anterior descending artery, Saphenous
vein graft->Obtuse marginal artery, Saphenous vein
graft->Posterior descending artery). Bilateral pulmonary vein
isolation with MAZE procedure and ligation of left atrial
appendage.


History of Present Illness:
70 year old albanian speaking gentleman admitted to hospital
this past [**Month (only) 404**] with increasing dyspnea. He ruled out for a
myocardial infarction however, a cardiac catheterization
revealed significant two vessel disease. He was thus referred
for sugical revascularization.

Past Medical History:
1. CAD:
-Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient
-Stress test [**2-/2170**]: exercised 11 minutes on a modified [**Doctor First Name **]
protocol and achieved 9.2 mets; ECG showed 0.5-1mm upsloping ST
depressions inferolaterally and perfusion imaging showed a
medium sized severe partially reversible apical defect which was
consistent with and unchanged from prior tests.
-Cardiac catheterization [**9-/2169**]: two vessel disease: LAD with
40-50% proximal stenosis, totally occluded after the first
diagonal.  LCX with large OM1 with 80% proximal stenosis at the
bivercation.
2. HTN
4. Hyperlipidemia
5. GERD

Social History:
Lives with son.  Competent in IADLs.  No smoking, no EtOH.


Family History:
No h/o heart attack or sudden cardiac death.

Physical Exam:
VITALS: 133/90, 56, 16, 84.5 kg
GENERAL: generally well-appearing, in NAD
HEENT:  EOMI, PERRLA, clear oropharynx
NECK:  no JVD.
CARDIAC:  RRR.  Normal s1/s2.  Slightly bradycardic.  No m/r/g.

LUNGS:  CTA bilaterally.  No crackles.  No focal changes.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, non-tender.
EXTREMITIES:  No pitting edema.  2+ PT pulses bilaterally. No
varicosities.


Pertinent Results:
[**2171-3-21**] ECHO
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is normal in size. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. A-pacing. Preserved
biventricular sytolic function post-bypass. Trace MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
Aortic contours normal post-decannulation. Left atrial appendage
is not visible post-Maze procedure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 70330**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2171-3-21**] and taken directly
to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to three vessels as well as a full MAZE procedure.
Please see operative note for details. Postoperatively he was
taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for
monitoring. Over the next several hours, Mr. [**Known lastname 70330**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**]
neurologically intact and was extubated. Beta blockade, aspirin
and a statin were resumed. On postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname 70330**]
was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. He
was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. As his blood pressure
remained on the lower end of normal, resumption of his ace
inhibitor was deferred to his cardiologist as an outpatient. Mr.
[**Known lastname 70330**] continued to make steady progress and was discharged home
on postoperative day 4. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**], his
cardiologist and his primary care physician as an outpatient.
