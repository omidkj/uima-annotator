Brief Hospital Course:
1.  Ischemic Leg Ulcer:  Pt was admitted from OSH for
intervention for non-healing LLE ischemic-limb-threatening
ulcer.  LE angiogram which revealed distal above-knee 85%
stenosis of the popliteal artery, TO tibial artery an peroneal
artery with patent but diffusely diseased posterior tibial.
Initially the wound appeared frankly purulent and grew
Pseudomonas (treated with Zosyn and emperic vancomycin).  Given
the pt's comorbidities (see below) and his high-risk for
perioperative mortality, the decision was made to forgo
definitive surgery at this time.  The wound was debrided daily
at bedside and Mr.[**Known lastname 60132**] was taken to the OR [**1-18**] for
debridement under anesthesia and went into hypovolemic
shock/adrenal insufficiency/septic shock subsequently (see
below).  Taken to the MICU and treated with stress steroids and
fluid boluses.  Pt will have skin graft in future by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 60133**] in plastic surgery clinic, since Mr.[**Known lastname 60132**] has too
many medical comorbidities to undergo a vascular surgery safely.
 Pt will need VAC dressing changes every 3-4 days.  We will
continue vancomycin and zosyn as long as the pt has an open
wound.  He has PICC access for IV antibiotics.

2.  CAD:  Pt had stress MIBI during pre-op risk stratification.
Had a small reversible inferior defect.  He was continued on
asprin, beta blocker, statin and ACE.  No chest pain or EKG
changes during his hospitalization.

3.  CHF:  Pt with diastolic heart failure with preserved EF of
>65%.  Mr.[**Known lastname 60132**] went into acute volume overload with the dye
load from his lower extremity angiogram.  When he was
transferred to the medicine service he was diuresed with IV
lasix and his beta-blocker was titrated up to decrease
chronotropy.  Mr.[**Known lastname 60132**] is quite volume sensitive.  Currently
he is on PO lasix at a dose of 40mg per day, which should be
continued.  He is on maximal beta-blocker therapy of lopressor
100 mg [**Hospital1 **] for the above reasons.

4.  Shock:  Pt went into combined hypovolemic/septic shock with
adrenal insufficiency at the time of open debridement [**1-18**].  He
required numerous fluid boluses and neosynephrine gtt overnight.
 He was transferred to the MICU where he was started on
gentamycin for Pseudomonal coverage and stress dose steroids
(for 7 days, no longer on gentamycin).  He takes 5 mg po qD
prednsione for "COPD," and now likely has a primary adrenal
insufficiency due to this.  He will be discharged on prednisone
20mg po qD for life.  He should wear a adrenal insufficiency
med-alert bracelet.  Currently, the pt's blood pressure is
stable ~130's/70's.

5.  R-sided Pleural Effusion:  Pt had a R-sided pleural effusion
associated with his possible aspiration pneumonia.  Since the
effusion cleared with diuresis, it was attributed to CHF and not
empyema/parapneumonic.  No tap was done.

6.  Aspiration PNA:  Mr.[**Known lastname 60132**] was noted to have bibasilar
opacities worrisome for aspiration pneumonia.  He was already
being treated with vanc/zosyn so no new antibiotics were added.
Sputum culture only showed oropharyngeal flora.  The opacities
resolved by time of discharge.

7.  COPD:  Pt required nebulized albuterol and atrovent
throughout his hospitalization.  He had audible wheezing and
decreased air movement on physical.  He will require nebs and
continued steroids as an outpt. Diagnosis needs to be clarified;
recommend outpt PFTs if hasn't had recently. Pt will f/u with
PCP for this.

8.  Refeeding Syndrome:  Mr.[**Known lastname 60132**] developed refractory
hypokalemia, hypomagnesiumeima and hypophosphatemia when he
began to take PO after his ICU stay (where he was NPO).  These
electrolyte abnormalities were repleted vigilantly.  Other
potential contributors to Mr.[**Known lastname 60134**] electrolyte problems
include albuterol toxicity (cellular redistribution of
potassium) and zosyn (acting as a non-reabsorbable anion,
increasing distal delivery of sodium, and coupled with [**Male First Name (un) 2083**],
causing potassium wasting at principal cell).  At time of
discharge, his electrolytes will need to be checked 3 times per
week.
