CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
to the trauma surgery service. Cardiac surgery was consulted
for the presence of the peri-aortic hematoma. Upon
evaluation, they felt that this lesion could be watched
without further intervention.  Otherwise, the patient was in
the ICU for pulmonary toilette. Patient was advanced to
regular diet by hospital day number #[**Serial Number 57431**]. However, after transfer to the
VICU, the patient had an acute desat event where his sats
went down to 76%.  The patient was transferred back to the
trauma ICU where the patient underwent intubation for
presumed respiratory failure. The patient was started on
antibiotics. Sputum was sent that grew out hemophilus
influenza beta lactamase negative and gram negative rods.
The patient was treated for the pneumonia and was slowly
weaned from the vent settings; however, the patient did not
tolerate being off of the ventilator support. Thus, the
patient underwent a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy.  After the patient was intubated, the patient
also was noted to have a significant amount of effusion on
the left chest and the chest tube on the left side was placed
to remove the effusion.  The chest tube was subsequently
discontinued when there was a minimal amount of fluid coming
from the chest tube. The patient, of note, also was in atrial
fibrillation during this time which was controlled with both
Lopressor and Amiodarone. The patient was converted to sinus
rhythm.  After the patient was trached and PEG'd, the patient
was doing well with Neurontin and Roxicet and Tylenol for
pain management.  The patient was on Amiodarone and
Lopressor.  The patient tolerated periods of trache mask but
continues to require some ventilatory support.

Gastrointestinal: The patient was on tube feeds.

Genitourinary:  The patient's Foley was discontinued on
