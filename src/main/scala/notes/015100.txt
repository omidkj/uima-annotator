STAT ADDENDUM

NOTE:  Please refer to the previous discharge summary and
discharge summary addendum for the patient's initial history
of present illness and hospital course.

The patient was not discharged to rehabilitation on [**2153-6-24**]
secondary to developing a recurrence of his sigmoid volvulus
demonstrated clinically and as evidenced by a CT scan
performed on that day.  General surgery consult was obtained
which lead to the placement of a rectal tube.  There was
adequate decompression of the sigmoid volvulus as evidenced
by a KUB that was obtained thereafter.

After several discussions with the family and with the
patient's primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], it was decided
that a limited work up of the patient's large bowel would be
undertaken for the purpose of evaluating the suitability of a
surgical intervention to deal with the recurrent sigmoid
volvulus.  On [**6-28**] of [**2153**], the patient underwent a
colonoscopy which was negative for any cancerous lesions or
any strictures.  With these results, it was felt that a
sigmoid colectomy with an end colostomy would be in the
patient's best interest given the high likelihood of a
recurrent sigmoid volvulus and the associated morbidity and
mortality risks.

On [**6-29**] of [**2153**], the patient went to the Operating Room
and underwent uncomplicated sigmoid colectomy with an end
colostomy.  His postoperative course was relatively
uneventful.  He initially had some difficulties with
maintaining an adequate oral intake.  On [**7-1**], the
patient underwent a nutritional consult.  On [**7-2**], TPN
was initiated.

On postoperative day 3, the patient spiked a fever to 101.2??????
and his lung exam was concerning for developing pneumonia.
He is therefore initiated on a course of levofloxacin and
clindamycin.  On postoperative day 4, the patient's single
lumen right subclavian central line was removed and a new
triple lumen catheter was inserted into the right subclavian.

The patient received 1 units of blood for a symptomatic
anemia on [**7-4**], postoperative day 5.  His white count
had risen to 14.9 over the previous few days, but was back
down to normal by postoperative day 5.  On postoperative day
6, the patient was initiated on sips, but due to concerns
from the nursing staff that the patient might be aspirating,
he was made NPO and underwent a swallow study on the 13th
which failed to demonstrate any aspiration.  The patient was
maintained on his TPN as a supplement to his nutritional
intake as his diet was slowly advanced.  On the day prior to
discharge, the patient had taken 720 cc of a regular diet in
addition to his usual TPN.  His ostomy had opened up on
postoperative day 8 and was putting out stool and gas in
adequate amounts.  On postoperative day 9, the patient's
antibiotics were discontinued.  The patient's Foley catheter
came out on postoperative day 6 and he was incontinent of
urine for the remainder of his hospital course.  Cultures of
his central line tip as well as blood and urine were all
negative.

By postoperative day 10, the patient had remained afebrile,
was tolerating adequate amounts of a regular diet, was off
TPN and making good amounts of urine and stool.  It was
decided that the patient was stable to be discharged back to
[**Hospital3 672**] Hospital for further short term
rehabilitation with a plan for ultimate disposition to [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 104285**]Nursing Home per the family's wishes.  The patient's
PICC line will be left in place for provision of easy venous
access while in the rehabilitation facility.  He is
discharged to rehabilitation in stable condition.
