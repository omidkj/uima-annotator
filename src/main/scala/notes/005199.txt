[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   77 year old woman with s/p avr, septal myomectomy
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   f/u atx



Provisional Findings Impression: IPf MON [**2126-10-14**] 1:29 PM
Left lower lobe opacification with blunting of the left
costophrenic angle,
raising the possibility for a small pleural effusion on the left
with
associated consolidation in the lower lobe. Please evaluate and
correlate
clinically. This opacification might be also due to positioning
of the
patient and attenuation from the soft tissue of the breasts.


Final Report
HISTORY: 77-year-old woman with status post aortic valve
replacement, septal
myomectomy. Follow up for pneumothorax.

FINDINGS: On the left, there is increased opacification in the
lower lobes,
which might be related to soft tissue positioning of the
breasts, but
consolidation cannot be excluded. There is blunting of the left
costophrenic
angle, which likely represents small pleural effusion. The
post-surgical
changes are noted again. The right IJ has been removed. The
cardiac
silhouette is unchanged compared to the previous scan. The
visualized osseous
and soft tissue markings are unchanged compared to the previous
scan.

IMPRESSION: Opacification in the left lower lobe, which might
represent small
pleural effusion with associated consolidation. The
opacification might be
also due to adjacent soft tissue attenuation from the breast
tissue. Clinical
correlation is needed.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Echo
Prebypass

1.The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. A left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial septum is seen at rest. A small secundum atrial
septal defect is present.

2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%).

3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. with normal free wall contractility.

4.There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

5.The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.

6.The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**2-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

7.There is no pericardial effusion.

8. Septal hypertrophy seen. Very narrow LVOT( 1.1 cm in diamter)

8. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**2126-10-9**]
at 1030am.

Post Bypass

1. Patient is being AV paced and receiving an infusion of
phenylephrine.

2. Biventricular systolic function is preserved.

3. Bioprosthetic valve seen in the aortic position. Leaflets
move well and the valve apears well seated. Peak gradient is 12
mmHg.

4. Mild moderate mitral regurgitation present.

5. Aorta intact post decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**10-9**] and underwent surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Transferred
to the CVICU in stable condition on insulin, phenylephrine, and
propofol drips. Extubated the morning of POD #1.  She remained
hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the stepdown
floors on POD1. Once on the fllor the patients post-op course
was uneventful. Her cardiac medications were tapered to
hemodynamics, her activity was advanced with the assistance of
physical therapy however her progress was slow and on POD6 it
was decided she would require a short stay at rehabilitation.
She was transfereed to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on POD6.
