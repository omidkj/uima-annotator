Exercise myocardial perfusion scan [**3-28**]:
Rest and stress perfusion images show normal tracer uptake
throughout
the left ventricular myocardium. The left ventricular size is
mild- to-moderately dilated. The end diastolic volume is 160 ml.

Gated wall motion images show global left ventricular
hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 42%.

LABORATORY DATA:
Total cholesterol 220

Most recent labs. Na 133 K 6, Cr 2.2, BUN 27, Mag 1.3.


Brief Hospital Course:
46 yo M with PMH of borderlin HTN, hyperlipidemia transferred
from OSH with sepsis [**2-22**] LLL PNA c/b myocardial depression, EF
25%.
.
PNEUMONIA: Patient had a LLL PNA on CXR from OSH and sputum
culture with many polys.  He had received a variety of abx at
OSH and was continued with coverage for CAP with levofloxacin as
well as vancomycin for MRSA coverage.  He was weaned off
levophed.  He was discharged on levofloxacin.
.
PERICARDITIS: He had pleuritic CP with diffuse ST elevations on
EKG and normal CEs, suggestive of pericarditis.  He was started
on NSAIDS following recovery of his renal function.
.
ACUTE SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: He had evidence of biventricular
heart failure on ECHO at OSH with EF 25% and elevated PAP
pressure of 40.  A recent cardiac CT in [**12-28**] showed normal EF
and normal coronary arteries. His depressed contractility was
thought to be secondary to sepsis vs myocarditis.  He did not
appear volume overloaded on exam.
- A follow-up echo should be done to look for resolution of
heart falure.

ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: Patient appeared to have acute prerenal
failure, likely from sepsis and decreased cardiac output.  As he
recovered, his creatinine improved from 1.8 to 1.4

HYPERGLYCEMIA: Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] may have borderline diabetes at
home.  He was cover with ISS.
- outpatient fasting glucose.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary:
- Pneumonia
- Septicemia
- Myocardial Depression, likely related to septicemia, no
symptoms or diagnosis of congestive heart failure.


Discharge Condition:
Afebrile, VSS


Discharge Instructions:
You were hospitalized because you had pneumonia and were
septicemic.  Because of your condition, you had some transient
loss of heart efficiency, which we expect to improve with time.
Your blood pressure and heart rate are stable and well
controlled without medications.  We have scheduled a repeat
Echocardiogram in six weeks to evaluate your recovery.

For now, we would like you to take 4 more days of Levofloxacin
to treat your pneumonia.  Additionally, take Ibuprofen to help
with the pain/inflammation around your heart and lungs.


Followup Instructions:
Your appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 311**] is on [**12-23**] at 2:30pm

Cardiology:
Your appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is on [**12-25**] at 11:45am.  His

[**Telephone/Fax (1) 5068**].

You have a follow up Echocardiogram in six weeks on [**1-25**]
at 3pm at the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Center.  Their number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**].
