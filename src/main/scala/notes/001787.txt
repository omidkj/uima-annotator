Chief Complaint:
Epigastric pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Angiogram.


History of Present Illness:
81 M c CAD c hx remote MI, CABG in [**2130**] c SVG to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] and
SVG to RCA; recent cath in [**11-11**] demonstrating patent SVG to
[**Date Range **]/OM with OM supplying collaterals to RCA/LAD.  SVG to RCA
graft occluded proximally.  Severe native vessel disease: LMCA

prox.  Also has history of CHF c EF 20% 3/05 c 3+ MR, 3+TR,
moderate pulmonary HTN, and a history of atrial flutter s/p
cardioversion to NSR in [**2-11**] followed by [**Hospital1 **]-V ICD placement.
.
Presented to ED complaining of 1 day history of sharp, RUQ and
epigastric pain, nausea c 1 episode of vomiting.  He reported
missing his medications on [**8-28**] and taking them on [**8-29**] on an
empty stomach.  No other GI complaints; normal BM last on [**8-29**],
no BRBPR, melena, diarrhea.  CT abdomen done showing known
distal abdominal aneurysm 3.9*3.5 cm extending into both
proximal common iliac arteries, cholelithiasis, and no acute
abdominal pathology.  Labs notable for 2 negative cardiac
enzymes.  ETT-MIBI done; exercised 5.75 min on modified [**Doctor Last Name 4001**]
protocol; test stopped [**1-11**] hypotension and 2 six beat runs of
NSVT c exertion.  Imaging showed a new partially reversible
inferior wall defect, stable fixed defect in the distal anterior
wall/apex, and stable moderate partially reversible
antero/infero-septal defect.  After return to [**Name (NI) **], pt. had 2
episodes of sustained polymorphic VT for which he received 2 ICD
shocks.  Received amiodarone and started on heparin gtt and sent
to cath lab; since pt. stable in cath lab c native v-paced
rhythm and no complaints, decision made to defer cath to AM and
pt. transfered to CCU for monitoring.

ETT:  81 yo man (s/p CABG and h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy
with LVEF ~ 30%) was referred to evaluate his shortness of
breath and an
atypical chest discomfort. The patient completed 5.75 minutes of
a
[**Doctor Last Name 4001**] protocol representing a limited functional exercise
tolerance.
Although the patient was near fatigue secondary to shortness of
breath,
the exercise test was stopped secondary to a hypotensive blood
pressure
response accompanied by ventricular irritability. No chest,
back, neck
or arm discomforts were reported during the procedure. The ECG
changes
are uninterpretable in the presence of ventricular pacing.
Atrial and
ventricular pacing was noted at baseline. Sinus with rhythm with

occasional VPDs were noted in exercise and post-exercise. Toward
peak
exercise, two 6-beat runs of nonsustained VT were noted. As
noted, a
hypotensive blood pressusre response to exercise was noted.
MIBI:  1.  Transient cavitary dilitation.  2.  New, moderate,
partially reversible defect in the inferior wall.  Stable,
moderate, predominantly fixed defect in the distal anterior wall
and apex.  Stable , moderate, partially reversible antero- and
inferoseptal defect.  3.  Global hypokinesis, with best
preserved motion in the anterior and lateral walls.  LVEF 31%.

Cath: [**8-31**]: 1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant system
revealed severe native three vessel disease.  The LMCA is
heavily
calcfied and diffusely diseased.  The LAD is proximally occluded
after a
small diagnonal.  The LCx is proximally occluded.  The RCA is
known to
be proximally occluded and not engaged (compared to angiography
in
[**11-11**], the LAD is now completely occluded).
2.  Graft angiography showed that the SVG to D1 to OM graft is
patent
with 50% lesion at the anastamosis with D1 and distal 50%
discrete
stenosis.
3.  Hemodyanmic measurements shows elevated right and left sided
filling
pressure, severe pulmonary hypertension, as well as reduced
cardiac
output (see table above).
4.  Left ventriculogram was not performed due to concerns about
the
patient's renal insufficiency.  In addition, non-invasive
assessment of
the patient's left ventricular systolic function is available.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 81 yo male w/ CAD s/p CABG, CHF, [**Hospital1 **]-V ICD presents with
epigastric pain, developed V-fib post ETT-MIBI.
1.) Cardiovascular: a) Ischemia: Patient with known severe 3
vessel disease, s/p CABG with subsequent occlusion of RCA graft,
now presents with atypical chest pain and new reversible defect
on MIBI suggesting unstable angina.  The episode of Vfib after
ETT was likely [**1-11**] ischemia; however, we cannot anatomically
localize polymorphic VT, therefore must also consider
medications and electrolyte abnormalities are also on the
differential although much less likely.  The patient was treated
with 24 hours of heparin and underwent cardiac cath, and was
found to have severe disease however, no lesions were amenable
to cath.  He was continued on aspirin, plavix, statin,
betablocker and ace-inhibitor.  b) Pump- Mr [**Known lastname **] has severe
ischemic CHF, with an EF of ~30%. He will be discharged on a low
Na diet, and instructed to perform daily weights. c) Rhythm: BiV
ICD in place, paced rhythm currently.  S/p VF in ED with ICD
firing x2.  As above, this is likely secondary to ischemia,
however there were no treatable lesions found with cath.  His
metoprolol was increased and he was loaded with Amiodarone in an
attempt to maintain normal rhythm.  He will follow up with
cardiology.
.
2.) Leukocytosis- This is most likely secondary to his [**1-11**] ICD
firing, however, he did have a small area of erythema on his arm
due to phlebitis.   He was treated  with a 2
