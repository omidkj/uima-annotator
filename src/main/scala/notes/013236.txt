Service:ORTHO
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Failure of fixation, thoracic spine
2.  Superficial wound infection, thoracic spine

PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE:  Revision thoracic fusion
HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:  Ms. [**Known lastname 71353**] is an
82-year-old female status post T3 to T12 posterior spinal
fusion on [**2193-3-30**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**].  Her postoperative course
was remarkable for respiratory compromise, requiring
reintubation and extended stay in the Medical Intensive Care
Unit.  She was diagnosed with pneumonia and congestive heart
failure, as well as an effusion of unclear etiology.  The
returned shortly thereafter to [**Hospital6 1597**] after
reported respiratory arrest.  The details of this are
unclear.  She was also noted to have a pressure eschar on her
back, and was transferred to Dr.[**Name (NI) 12040**] service at [**Hospital1 1444**] for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Significant for congestive heart
failure, hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, restrictive
lung disease, severe osteoporosis, severe scoliosis and
kyphosis, gastroesophageal reflux disease with hiatal hernia,
question of dementia, history of falls, hard of hearing.

ALLERGIES:   Morphine, gastrointestinal upset.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:   Subcutaneous heparin, Captopril,
lasix, Peri-Colace, Risperdal, Zantac, Diamox, Lopressor,
vancomycin and Rifampin, both of which were started at [**Hospital3 **], and Colace.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, the patient was an
elderly female, in no apparent distress, but appearing drowsy
and difficult to arouse.  Her heart was regular rate and
rhythm.  The lungs had bibasilar crackles as well as
decreased breath sounds, left greater than right.
Examination of her back revealed approximately an 6 x 8 cm
eschar over the mid-portion of her wound on the left side.
There was no surrounding cellulitis.  She was neurologically
intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 12040**]
service.  X-rays were obtained.  These showed failure of
fixation of her thoracic hardware, presumably due to a fall
prior to admission at [**Hospital3 **].

A Medical consult was obtained, with the plan for revision
thoracic fusion, given the pull-out of her hardware as well
as the question of the depth of her wound infection.

The patient was taken to surgery on [**2193-5-28**].  For details of
the surgery, please see Dr.[**Name (NI) 12040**] operative dictation.
Intraoperatively, the patient did lose approximately 2500 cc
of blood, and was transfused with six units of packed red
cells, four units of fresh frozen plasma, as well as 5 liters
of Crystalloid.

Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit for ventilator support as well as close
hemodynamic monitoring.  The patient's Surgical Intensive
Care Unit course was complicated by several self-extubations,
requiring reintubation.  She ultimately underwent
tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
placement as her wean from the ventilator was quite slow, and
her nutrition poor.

Plastic Surgery was asked to consult for evaluation of her
wound.  Note that intraoperatively the eschar was seen to be
fairly superficial infection, with no involvement of the
underlying fascia.  Plastic Surgery felt that the wound may,
indeed, need a flap, but that the patient's nutrition was too
poor to heal any kind of extensive soft tissue procedure.
Their inclination was to begin Silvadene dressing changes
over the eschar, and to let the wound take its course and
attempt to improve nutrition prior to any procedure.

The patient was maintained on vancomycin throughout her
admission, as she had grown methicillin resistant
staphylococcus aureus from superficial wound cultures, both
at [**Hospital3 **] and at [**Hospital1 69**].

The patient's Surgical Intensive Care Unit course was
otherwise unremarkable.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE BY SYSTEM:
1.  Neurologic:  The patient is neurologically intact.  She
follows simple commands.
2.  Cardiovascular:  Her heart rate and blood pressure have
been well controlled.
3.  Respiratory:  She is on a pressure support ventilator
with pressure support of 12, PEEP of 7.5, at a pressure in
the 40s.  Her tidal volumes have been 300, with 24-30
respirations per minute.  She does have known bilateral
pleural effusions.
4.  Gastrointestinal:  She is tolerating tube feeds with
Impact with fiber.
5.  Renal:  Her BUN and creatinine have been stable.
6.  Endocrine:  No issues.
7.  Hematology:  No issues.
8.  Infectious Disease:  She is currently on vancomycin, day
number 25.  She should continue at least a six week course of
vancomycin, currently at 750 mg intravenously every 18 hours.
The wound appears clean, dry and intact, with the exception
of the area along the eschar.  This is open and draining
slightly serous/discolored material.  We will continue with
Silvadene dressings for the time being.  If this wound opens
up further, the patient should be placed on twice a day
wet-to-dry dressing changes.
9.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  She is tolerating
tube feeds with Impact with fiber at 50 cc/hour.
10. Prophylaxis:  Subcutaneous heparin.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  Continue dressing changes twice a day with Silvadene or
wet-to-dries as discussed above.
2.  Continue methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus
precautions.
3.  Continue vancomycin for at least six weeks total.
4.  Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 363**] when possible.
5.  Please follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13797**] from Plastic Surgery
or contact his office with any questions about flap coverage.
Please refer other questions to Dr.[**Name (NI) 12040**] office.

1.  Niferex 150 mg twice a day
2.  Fosamax 10 mg every morning
3.  Zinc sulfate 220 mg once daily
