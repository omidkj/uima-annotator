History of Present Illness:
This is a 72 year old man who is Portuguese speaking, on
Coumadin for DVT. He fell down [**2-28**] stairs on [**2183-1-26**], +head
trauma, unknown LOC. Per family, he felt well and refused to go
to hospital.He later developed severe HA

Chest XR [**2183-1-27**]
1. ET tube 5 mm distal to the right main bronchus. Recommend
retraction by
approximately 4-5 cm to achieve appropriate positioning.
2. Enteric tube in appropriate position.
3. Subtle irregularity along anterolateral left eighth and ninth
ribs, to be correlated with focal tenderness for possible
fracture.
4. Low lung volumes, accentuating bronchovascular markings

CT head [**2183-1-27**]
1. Large right subdural hematoma along the entire right cerebral
hemisphere  and along the right tentorium cerebelli.
2. Large, 2.5 cm wide right parietal epidural hematoma with
"swirl" sign,
suggesting hyperacute epidural hematoma.
3. Severe right, and moderate left cerebral edema with 1.5 cm
shift to the
 left.
4. Effacement of the suprasellar cisterns and right ambient
cistern,
concerning for impending herniation.  5. Small amount of SAH vs.
pseudo SAH (due to edema) in the Sylvian fissures.  prior OSH
exam is not available for comparison

CT head [**2183-1-28**]
FINDINGS: There has been interval right-sided craniotomy with
evacuation of the right subdural and epidural hematoma. There is
decreased leftward shift of normally midline structures, now
measuring 4 mm (previously 15 mm). The basal cisterns now appear
patent. There is decreased cerebral edema with improved
demonstration of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation. There is a small
residual subdural hematoma layering along the entire right
convexity and tentorium, measuring 5 mm in thickness. There is a
small residual right parietal epidural hematoma, measuring 6-mm
in thickness. No subarachnoid or intraventricular hemorrhage is
seen.

Craniotomy changes and associated hardware are present. A large
amount of
post-operative pneumocephalus is noted. The visualized portions
of the
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
Aerosolized fluid pooling in the posterior nasopharynx likely
represents retained secretions relAted to intubated status.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval right craniotomy and evacuation of right subdural
and epidural
hematoma with marked improvement in mass effect and cerebral
edema. Leftward midline shift now measures 4mm (previously 15
mm). Basal cisterns now appear patent.
2. Small residual right subdural hematoma and small residual
right parietal epidural hematoma.
3. Post-operative pneumocephalus.

[**2183-1-28**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. Small bore feeding tube is seen within the stomach in proper
position.
2. Endotracheal tube approximately 2.9 cm from the carina.
3. Left subclavian central line with tip terminating in the mid
SVC
.
[**2183-2-11**] CT Head:
The patient is status post right frontal temporoparietal
craniotomy
for right hemispheric subdural hematoma evacuation. Again seen
is a small
right subdural collection surrounding the right cerebral
convexity, maximally measuring 7 mm. In comparison to the prior
study, there is decreased attenuation of the subdural hematoma,
suggesting interval evolution. There is mild decrease in the
hyperdense hematoma layering the tentorium cerebelli. Mild
effacement of the right hemispheric sulci, predominantly in the
temporoparietal regions, is stable. Minimal leftward shift of
midline structures, is unchanged. Mild compression of the right
lateral ventricle is unchanged. No acute intraparenchymal
hemorrhage, edema, or mass is seen. There is interval resolution
of previously seen pneumocephalus. Calcification in both
cavernous carotid arteries are noted. The imaged paranasal
sinuses are clear. Minimal fluid is seen within both mastoid air
cells. No abnormal enhancement is seen in the post-contrast
images.

IMPRESSION:
1. Status post evacuation of right subdural hematoma, with
interval evolution of previously seen small residual right-sided
SDH. Mild interval decrease in the layering SDH in the tentorium
cerebelli, compared to [**2183-2-1**].

2. Stable minimal leftward shift of midline structures. No new
hemorrhage or acute infarction.
.
[**2183-2-12**] CXR:
Left PIC line ends in the right atrium, approximately 4 cm below
the level of the superior cavoatrial junction. Lungs are low in
volume, making it
difficult to exclude mild interstitial edema, particularly in
the left lung. Large pneumoperitoneum seen on [**2-10**] is less
recognizable today, and could be smaller, but is definitely
still present. Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Pleural
effusion is small, if any. No pneumothorax.
.
RUQ Ultrasound ([**2183-2-12**]):
Limited views of the liver obtained due to a small acoustic
window.
The liver parenchyma is grossly normal. There are echogenic
areas within the right and left lobe of liver which are
subcentimeter and most likely represent scarring.
