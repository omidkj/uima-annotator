Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
CC: dyspnea
PCP: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
Outpatient Cardiologist: none


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right sided PA catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
54 yo F with PMH sarcoidosis, tracheostomy [**3-14**] upper airway
obstruction, dCHF, DM1, pulmonary HTN, CAD, morbid obesity p/w
abdominal pain radiating to the back and shortness of breath.
Given nebs/lasix 80 IV/ and 2 nitro SL. Has history of CAD, CHF
and sarcoidosis. BIBEMS 95% on NRB. BP 210/100 with EMS. She has
had 3 admissions within the last 2 months for dyspnea (thought
related to CHF/COPD) and nausea/abdominal pain likely from
gastroparesis
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was sitting at home this afternoon when she began
experiencing gradual onset SOB. She says she first noticed
dyspnea with exertion (wheeling around apartment) about a day
ago; no orthopnea/pnd. sleeps on 3 pillows for comfort. She has
noticed progressive LE edema since last discharge. She took a
few nebs at home without relief so she called 911. EMS found her
ot have SaO2 in mid 80's on room air; put her on blow-by. 80 IV
lasix, 2 sL NTG. She also complains of nausea/vomiting and sharp
epigastric intermittent pain, similar to what last brought her
to the ED. She denies any chest pain or tightness, no syncope or
palpitations.
.
Initial VS in ED: T 97.3 HR 72 BP 164/74 RR 16 SaO2 89% on RA;
respiratory distress. She was given 80mg IV lasix & 2 NTG by EMS
and is negative 1.8L. She was placed on nitro drip in ED with
improvement in her symptoms. CXR showed CHF.

UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The patient is status post
tracheostomy, with the tube tip in satisfactory position
approximately 4.5 cm from the carina. Bilateral hazy opacities
are seen with increased vascular markings and vascular
indistinctness, compatible with pulmonary edema. Cardiac
silhouette is difficult to assess, but appears at least mildly
enlarged. The right costophrenic angle is excluded from view.
There is likely at least small bilateral pleural effusions. No
pneumothorax. Clips are seen projecting over
the left superior mediastinum. Elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm is seen.

IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with moderate pulmonary edema
and probable small bilateral pleural effusions. The right
costophrenic angle is excluded from the study.

[**5-17**] CT torso
1. Mild dilation of ileal small bowel loops with transition
point near an umbilical hernia represents at least partial
small-bowel obstruction. Early complete obstruction is a less
likely possibility.
2. Stable extensive coronary artery atherosclerotic
calcification and post CABG changes.
3. Pulmonary artery enlargement suggestive of pulmonary artery
hypertension is unchanged since [**2191-1-3**].
4. No evidence of pneumonia.

[**8-17**] Echo
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
EKG: NSR at 88.  borderline left axis.  normal intervals.  Q in
III.  poor RWP and low voltages.

CARDIAC CATH [**2191-6-13**]
COMMENTS:
1.  Resting hemodynamics demonstrated marked biventricular
diastolic
dysfunciton, with a mean PCWP of 45 mmHg and an RVEDP of 32
mmHg.  There
was severe elevation of the PA pressures, with a mean PAP of 80
mmHg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
2. Severe pulmonary hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 54 yo woman with morbid obesity, DM1 with
numerous complications, diastolic CHF, pulmonary hypertension,
sarcoid s/p trach for upper airway obstruction who presents from
home with dyspnea

# Dyspnea/diastolic heart failure: Ms. [**Known lastname **] had complicated
respiratory issues with many admissions for dyspnea felt to be
from multifactory causes: diastolic CHF, reactive airways,
pulmonary hypertension.  Her current presentation and CXR seem
consistent with CHF exacerbation likely related to hypertension
and underdiuresis given progressive LE edema. She was referred
for right heart cath with mean PCWP of 45, PA systolic of 110
with PA diastolic 50. A PA catheter was placed and aggressive
diuresis was initiated. Diuresis was limited by several episodes
of hypotension requiring pressors, she appeared to be very
sensitive to quick volume shifts without time for
intravascular/extravascu
