Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Focal calcifications in aortic arch. Complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). Severe
AS (area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. No TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the procedure. No TEE related complications. The
patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Resting bradycardia
for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are thickened. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8cm2). Trivial aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results before surgical
incision.

POST-BYPASS:
The patient is A paced on low dose phenylephrine infusion. There
is a well seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position.
Peak & mean gradients across the valve are 11mmHg & 4mmHg,
respectively. The mitral regurgitation is now moderate.
Biventricular function is maintained. The aorta remains intact.
[**Male First Name (un) **] appreciated postoperatively, rate reduced, preload &
afterload increased with improvement in [**Male First Name (un) **]. Surgeon informed.
Intact thoracic aorta.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 75-year-old patient with a history of aortic stenosis
presented with an episode of syncope, and further investigations
revealed critical aortic stenosis with mild mitral regurgitation
and mild mitral stenosis.  The coronary arteries had no
