Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension- ? Cholangitis with CBD stone- x-ferred from [**Hospital 7912**].


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP [**2117-3-26**]

History of Present Illness:
74 year old male with a history of PUD s/p Billroth 21 years ago
x-ferred from OSH with ? of cholangitis and concern for CBD
stone and hypotension on levophed.

The patient developed on [**2117-3-24**] sudden onset of midepigastric
abdominal pain.  He was sitting in his living room and developed
the pain, but denies fever/chills, diarrhea or emesis, no BRBPR,
melena or hematemesis.
.
The patient was found at the OSH to have WBC 33, T.bili 5.1, AST
523, temperature was 97.0 and an Abdominal U/S showed CBD
dilatation 1.0 cm, cholelithiasis.  GI recommended MRCP but the
pt refused b/c of claustrophobia.  Pt developed hypotension
refractory to several fluid boluses so was transferred to the
ICU.   Pt was found to have Cr increase to 2.3 from 0.9 and Bcx
[**12-23**] grew out E. coli sensitive to Zosyn (also sensitive to
cefazolin, levolfoxacin, gentamicin).  Pt was x-ferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for ERCP (INR 1.2/PTT 39.5/Plt 108).

Past Medical History:
1. COPD- admitted [**2117-3-20**] at OSH with exacerbation.
2. PUD- Billroth 21 years ago.
3. Glaucoma
4. Hypertension

Pertinent Results:
 ECG Study Date of [**2117-3-27**]  8:59:02 PM
Probable multifocal atrial tachycardia
No previous tracing for comparison

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2117-3-27**] 7:45 AM
IMPRESSION: Worsening air space consolidation at the left base
since [**2117-3-26**].

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2117-3-26**] 4:51 PM

IMPRESSION:

Bilateral alveolar air space opacities with small bilateral
pleural effusions suggest volume overload. An underlying
infectious process, particularly at the bases cannot be
excluded.

ERCP S&I ([**Numeric Identifier 39322**])  [**2117-3-26**] 2:41 PM

ERCP: Four ERCP images were obtained by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Multiple
abdominal surgical clips are noted. Cholangiogram demonstrates
multiple filling defects in the common duct. By report, sludge
And purulent material were extracted. Final image demonstrates
placement of a biliary stent.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  The patient is a 74 year old male with a history of PUD
s/p Billroth admitted with midepigastric pain, WBC, elevated
T.bili, AST and a dilated CBD all suggestive of Cholangitis and
found to have E.coli bacteremia.
.
1. Cholangitis- most likely from CBD stone obstruction- most
likely explanation of fever, WBC, and abnormal LFTs, less likely
causes would be tumor compression of duct, stricture,
infiltration with flukes. Interestingly Amylase and lipase were
normal at OSH. Pt refused MRCP which would have helped in
diagnosing.
-An ERCP was performed on [**2117-3-26**] which found purulent material
in the CBD with multiple filling defects and a stent was
subsequently placed.
- The patient was switched from Zosyn to Levo as his E.Coli was
pansensitive.
.
2. Hypotension- most likely from bacteremia (Biliary E.coli
source) that lead to mild sepsis. WBC trended down.

.
3. COPD- The patient was recently admitted on [**3-20**] with
emphysema exacerbation.  Pt does not use Oxygen at home.
-- We continued Albuterol/Atrovent Nebs, fluticasone.
--We started levofloxacin for Cholangitis and also to cover any
Bronchitis component there may be to his respiratory distress.
.
4. ARF- baseline Cr 0.9 on admission, currently has gone up to
3.0.  DDx includes prerenal, ATN- hypotension, and interstitial
nephritis.

.
5. DNR/DNI- D/W patient and he would not like to be placed on a
respirator unless necessary for a medical procedure that would
be quickly resolvable.
.
6. Access- Left A-line, Right PICC line.
.
7. Communication- with wife.
.
8. On [**2117-3-29**], the patient was found by the nursing staff to be
unresponsive. He had a pulse but was apneic on BIPAP. An ABG
showed 6.99/19/126 which was consistent with respiratory
failure. The family agreed to noninvasive positive pressure
ventilation but once that failed, the decision was to withdraw
all measures. The patient passed away on a morphine drip and
comfort measures only without further events.
