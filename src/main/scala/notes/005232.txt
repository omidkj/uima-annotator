Please note that this history is compiled from various
consults through the chart including Anesthesia consult as
there is no history or physical exam in this patient's chart
at this time.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 75-year-old gentleman had
known cardiomyopathy and severe mitral regurgitation.  Past
medical history also includes chronic atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin therapy.  Prior cardiac catheterization showed 4+
mitral regurgitation.

ADDITIONAL MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Atrial fibrillation.
2. Mitral regurgitation.
3. Chronic renal insufficiency.
4. Hyperlipidemia.

Cardiac catheterization prior to surgery showed some
diastolic dysfunction and no angiographic evidence of
significant coronary artery disease.  The LVEDP was 20 with a
mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 27.  No gradient
was present across the aortic valve.

Echocardiography performed in [**2130-11-8**] showed a
dilated left atrium, dilated right atrium, ejection fraction
of greater than 55% with trace AI and 3+ MR.

EKG preoperatively showed atrial fibrillation with
inferolateral nonspecific ST-T wave changes.

Preoperatively, the patient did have some mild pulmonary
edema and some cardiomegaly.  The patient had been diuresed
by the medical doctor caring for the patient prior to
surgery.

Preoperative laboratory work showed a hematocrit of 39.6, PT
13.9, PTT of 26.5, INR of 1.3.  Sodium 134, K 3.8, chloride
96, bicarb 27, BUN 36, creatinine 1.4 with a blood sugar of

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Preoperatively on exam by Anesthesia,
the heart was regular rate and rhythm with a positive murmur
and lungs were clear bilaterally.  The abdominal exam was
benign.

The patient had opted for a mitral mechanical valve and on
the day of admission, [**2131-1-12**], the patient underwent
mitral valve replacement with a [**Street Address(2) 7163**]. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical
valve.  Left atrial appendage was also stapled.  Operation
was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

On postoperative day one, the patient had been extubated
overnight.  Was on amiodarone drip at 0.5, dobutamine at 2.0,
insulin at 3.0, and Neo-Synephrine had been weaned off
overnight.  Patient had a first degree A-V block.  Was
saturating 95% on 4 liters nasal cannula with a blood
pressure of 97/60, heart rate of 95.  Lungs had coarse breath
sounds bilaterally.  The heart appeared to be in sinus rhythm
with the A-V block.  Sternal incision was clean, dry, and
intact.  The abdominal exam was benign.  Extremities were
warm and well perfused.  Patient remained on a dobutamine
drip at that time for output of 3.41 and an index of 1.69
with plans to monitor patient's index to see if dobutamine
can be weaned.  Patient also continued on Vancomycin.

Patient had arrived from the OR on Neo-Synephrine drip as
well as amiodarone and dobutamine drips, and was A-V paced at
the time.

On postoperative day two, patient remained in the CSRU, was
alert and oriented.  Heart was regular rate and rhythm.
Lungs were clear bilaterally.  Incision was benign as well as
the rest of the exam.  Chest tubes were pulled.  Out index
was 2.38.  Patient only remained on oral amiodarone in
addition to the aspirin.  Dobutamine had been weaned off.
Swan was pulled, and patient started on Lasix diuresis with
plans to start 2 mg of Coumadin in the evening pending the
patient's morning coags.

Patient was seen by Physical Therapy, and patient was
transferred out to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2 on postoperative day two later in
the day.  Patient was dosed with Coumadin to start
anticoagulation again for his atrial fibrillation and his
mechanical mitral valve.  Patient was also seen by case
management.

On postoperative day three, patient remained in AFib with
stable vital signs satting 96% on 2 liters.  Lungs were clear
bilaterally.  Wound was clean, dry, and intact.  Chest tubes
were pulled as well as a Foley and pacing wires.  Followup
chest x-ray was ordered for noted air leak around the chest
tube to rule out pneumothorax.  Patient continued to
ambulate, and was encouraged to be out of bed and use the
incentive spirometer.  White count dropped from 30 to 18.1
with a hematocrit of 27.1, platelet count of 146,000.  Sodium
137, K 4.7, chloride 105, bicarb 26, BUN 25, creatinine 1.3,
and a blood sugar of 114.

Patient was alert and oriented, and was ambulating in the
[**Doctor Last Name **] on level 3 on postoperative day two.  Patient was rate
controlled in atrial fibrillation.  Patient dipped once to a
bradycardia in the 50s, but appeared to be tolerating that
well.  At one point in the afternoon on [**1-15**], the
patient's bradycardia dropped to 37.  The team was called.
Patient rapidly rose back up into the 50s and 60s without any
other episodes of the severe bradycardia.  The patient was
dosed with 5 mg that evening, and continued to be in atrial
fibrillation.

On postoperative day four, the amiodarone was discontinued.
Patient continued on Heparin anticoagulation as the INR was
slowly rising.  On the 9th, postoperative day four, PT was
13.6 with an INR of 1.2.  The white blood count dropped to
11.0.  Hematocrit remained stable at 26.4 and a creatinine of
1.2.  Chest x-ray the day prior showed left atelectasis and a
small amount of mediastinal air.  It was noted that the
patient did have a variable ventricular response to the
atrial fibrillation mostly with a heart rate in the 60s and
occasional block down to the high 40s.  Patient remained
hemodynamically stable, and was awaiting anticoagulation with
a goal INR of 3.0-3.5 for the mitral mechanical valve.

The patient did have significant pitting edema in the lower
extremities, and Lasix was increased.  Patient did the stairs
on postoperative day four also and was slightly unsteady, but
appeared to be doing well, and making good progress and
ambulation.

On the morning of the 10th, the INR rose to 2.0, and seemed
to be rising appropriately.  The patient was sent home with
instructions to continue this 5 mg dose of Coumadin pending
blood work and a phone call from the patient's physician to
dose the Coumadin again since the patient already done the
level 5 and was hemodynamically stable with controlled rate
of the atrial fibrillation, which was baseline.

It was determined by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] that the patient could go
home, and the patient was discharged on [**1-17**] to go
home with services from the VNA of Greater [**Hospital1 3597**].

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient should have his blood drawn
the following day and have the results forward to Dr.[**Name (NI) 111438**] office, patient's primary care physician for daily
dosing of the Coumadin and instructed to followup also with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the office at one week, and to followup with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**], his cardiologist on [**1-30**].  Patient was
also instructed to followup with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], his
Cardiothoracic surgeon in one month in the office for his
postoperative visit.
