HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67 year-old male with
a history of degenerative joint disease who was admitted for
a left total knee replacement after three Synvisc injections
provided only temporary relief for a few months.  He noted no

hematuria on admission.

lipoma excision in [**2153**].

MEDICATIONS:  1.  Aspirin 325 mg po b.i.d. starting [**2190-3-6**]
preop.  2.  Indocin 50 mg po q day held preop.  3.  Mavic 4
mg po q day.  4.  Albuterol prn.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his wife and quit smoking ten
years ago after two packs a day for many years.  He has no
drug use.  He drinks 24 ounces of wine per day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a well developed obese man in
no acute distress with a blood pressure of 164/82, pulse 97.
He is 6' tall and 250 pounds.  He is normocephalic,
atraumatic with anicteric sclera.  His neck is supple with no
lymphadenopathy.  He has no thyromegaly.  His heart is
regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs.  He has an S4.  His
lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His abdomen is
benign.  His extremities are warm with trace left ankle
edema.  He has normal dorsiflexion and plantar flexion.  His
neurological examination shows he is awake and oriented times
three with normal sensation over bilateral feet.  He has
antalgic gait that is unassisted and favors his left.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 6.1, hematocrit 31.7,
platelet count of 190.  His chem 7 shows a sodium of 138,
potassium 4.5, chloride 102, bicarb 27, BUN of 19 and
creatinine of 1.0.  Glucose 139, magnesium of 1.7.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After an uncomplicated left total knee
replacement, Mr. [**Known lastname 12056**] was admitted to the Orthopedics Flor
and kept on aspirin b.i.d. prophylaxis.  On postoperative day
number one he was noted to have slight shortness of breath
with a question of an asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease flare.  He was started on nebulizers but had
persistent tachycardia and a mild shortness of breath.  A CT
angiogram on the [**12-11**] revealed a left lingular
pulmonary artery filling defect consistent with a small PE.
He was initially started on heparin and then switched to
Lovenox.  He was also beginning to show signs of alcohol
withdraw.  Shortly thereafter he suffered a hypercarbic
respiratory arrest with associated hypotension that required
intubation and briefly pressors.  He was quickly weaned off
of pressors.  He had a short episode of acute renal failure
associated with hypotension that resolved with a return of
his blood pressure to normal and with hydration.  After a few
days of steroids, he was able to be weaned and extubated on
[**2190-3-16**].  As his sedation (Ativan and Fentanyl) was
lightened, evidence of alcohol withdraw became apparent again
and he was started on Valium and a CIWA scale until he became
asymptomatic.

During his Intensive Care Unit stay he received a ten day
course of antibiotics for a question of pneumonia.  He
exhibited delirium immediately after extubation that slowly
improved with a return to his baseline mental status by the
time of discharge.  He did have an exaggeration of his
baseline dysmetria that was concerning to the patient and his
wife.  This continued to improve during his stay to the point
where he was able to do activities of daily living without
significant difficulty, but with more tremor then at
baseline.  Neurology follow up in two weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was arranged to follow up on his symptoms and see if further
testing such as an MRI would be necessary.  He was continued
on his aspirin once per day for cerebrovascular accident
prophylaxis.

An arm rash was noted after the CT angiogram as well as some
complaints of dyspnea, which raised some concern of an
anaphylactic reaction to the contrast dye.  However, there
were multiple other contributing factors that could have been
involved in his respiratory arrest namely his hydromorphone
epidural, his reactive airway disease flare and possibly his
obstructive sleep apnea given his body habitus.  He should be
carefully monitored and perhaps receive precontrast steroids
if he needs contrast during studies in the future.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.
