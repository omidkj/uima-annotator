Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2518**]
Chief Complaint:
R hemiplegia and aphasia, found by friend

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation

History of Present Illness:
59yo M with unknown PMH found on floor of his bathroom by a
friend and 11am unable to speak with R hemiplegia. Further
history is unavailable at present as there is no emergency
contact information listed and the patient is unaccompanied.

Per chart review of limited records the patient was evaluated at
[**Hospital3 7571**]and found to have above symptoms and noted to be
hypertensive 181/92. He was started on Heparin gtt for CK MB 15.
Also given ativan 1mg, Lopressor 5mg IV. Urine tox at [**Location (un) **]
positive for benzos and opiates. Cocaine and ETOH negative. He
was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

ROS: Pt is unable to provide a ROS.


Past Medical History:
Unavailable at time of presentation.
Per chart review collected later from [**Hospital1 65180**]:
-Hypertension
-Coronary artery disease
-Diabetes
-COPD
-"Past stroke" (unknown details)
-Hepatitis C+
-Elevated LFT's
-Recent "neck polypectomy"
-History of polysubstance abuse (including cocaine, tobacco)


Social History:
Unable to elicit at presentation; later discovered that patient
lives with roommate [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 77021**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 77022**]), who
reported to team that patient has no family with whom he is in
contact.  [**Name (NI) 116**] have two sons (not contact information available)

arrive with patient's discharge instructions and summary.

Unable to elicit, unknown to friend.

Physical Exam:
EXAM AT PRESENTATION:
Vitals: T 99.1, BP 167/80, HR 100, R 18, 99% RA
Gen- moderately obese male, eyes open in bed, tracks examiner,
obvious R hemiplegia, NAD
HEENT: NCAT, anicteric, OP clear, MMM
Neck- no carotid bruits bilaterally, no meningismus, able to
active flex chin to chest.
CV- tachycardic, distant sounds, no MRG
Pulm- CTA B
Abd- obese, soft, NT, ND, BS+
Extrem- no CCE, warm well perfused, 2+ DP, PT pulses

Neurological examination:
MS- eyes open and tracking examiner. Follows simple commands
such
as "show me your left thumb." He attempts to nod yes or no to
questions but does not do so reliably, (ie- is it [**2120**]?, are we
in [**Location (un) 7349**]?, nods yes to all). He attempts to mouth certain words
but
there is no phonation. When asked to write with his left hand he
takes the pen and puts it in his mouth and chooses to hold the
clipboard. On FNF testing he touches his mouth repeatedly rather
than his nose.

CN- PERRL 5-->3mm, blinks to threat bilaterally, eyes conjugate
and at midline in neutral position, EOM's full without
nystagmus,
face appears summetric, he does not follow commands closely
enough to assess for facial weakness, palate elevates
symmetrically, tongue at midline. rotates head in both
directions.

Motor- Dense right hemiplegia without any movement to noxious on
the right arm. He minimally withdraws his left foot with noxious
stimulation. No adventitious movements noted. Nl bulk and tone.

Sensory-
Intact light touch and pinprick on the left.
Right arm with now wincing to pain. Right foot with slight
withdrawal with nailbed pressure.

Coordination- intact FNF (F-mouth-F) as outlined above on L.

Reflexes-
  [**Hospital1 **]  tri  brachiorad   Patell  ankles
R 3   3       3           3+      0
L 2   2       2           3+      0

Gait- unable to test d/t hemiplegia.

EXAM AT DISCHARGE ([**1-6**] - pertinent details):
Heart regular and lungs clear
NGT in place
Penile ulcer and swelling, with no discharge.
Mental status: alert, awake - follows only commands to "open and
close eyes" and "wiggle fingers" (of L side only), no other
commands or questions (severely limited comprehension), no
verbal output including sounds - completely aphonic, with
minimal movement of mouth.
CN: Right field cut (no blink to threat on right), EOM's full, R
facial droop, other CN intact except pt does not stick tongue
out and cannot tell if sensation equal due to commands
Sensori-Motor: R arm densely plegic with low tone; R leg
triple-flexion to stimulation; excellent strength and resistance
of both L arm and L leg; no tremor or asterixis
DTRs: slightly depressed in the right arm compared with
elsewhere, absent ankle jerks; R toe upgoing, L mute
Coord/gait could not be tested.

Imaging:
NCHCT at [**Location (un) **]- negative for infarct or hemorrhage.
.
CT/CTA- 1.  Large acute left ACA territory infarct with abrupt
cutoff of the A2
segment of the left ACA.

2.  Smaller area of acute infarction along the territory of the
left MCA,
without definite occlusion of the left MCA vessels.

3.  Subcentimeter hypoattenuation in the left internal
capsule/putamen is
likely not an acute process and is most consitent with  an old
lacune.

4.  Right greater than left PCA stenosis is moderate.

5.  Occlusion of the left internal carotid at the bifurcation
with distal
reconstitution near the left carotid canal.

6.  Extensive right internal carotid artery atherosclerosis
causes 70%
stenosis of the cervical ICA.
.

CXR: Two views, limited by the patient's habitus and his arms
overlying
the thorax on the lateral view, with no comparisons on record.
The lung
volumes are low with left basilar subsegmental atelectasis, but
no other focal airspace process.  Allowing for the limitations
above, the heart is probably normal in size, with no evidence of
CHF.  The regional skeleton is grossly unremarkable.

.
MRI Head: Since the CTA from [**2150-12-22**], new complete occlusion of
the left MCA.

Acute infarcts involving the majority of the left MCA territory
and the left ACA territory.

.
NCHCT [**2150-12-24**]: 1. Increase in the extent of  infarction of the
left ACA and MCA territories, compared to initial CTA but with
no significant chnage compared to the recent MR .

2.Increase in cerebral edema with  sulcal effacement, minimal
midline shift and mass effect on  the left lateral ventricle,
compared to the recent MR.

3.  No intracranial hemorrhage.

.
NCHCT [**2150-12-26**]: 1.  Interval progression in the extent of
infarction of the left ACA and MCA territories with new areas of
hemorrhagic transformation and increase in the shift of midline
structure which now measures 15 mm.

2.  No evidence of uncal or transtentorial herniation is noted.

.
NCHCT [**2150-12-27**]: Large area of  hypodensity with high density
material within it consistent with a hemorrhagic in
