Service:  HEPATOBILIARY SURGERY SERVICE


ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Bile duct stricture.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 58-year-old male
past medical history for Hodgkin lymphoma treated in the late
[**2151**] that is in remission. Status post radiation therapy,
complicated by significant brachial plexus injury rendering
his right upper extremity, which is illicitly nonfunctional.

The patient complained of abdominal discomfort that was
consistent with biliary colic in [**2187-10-2**], underwent
an ultrasound, which demonstrated an intra and extrahepatic
biliary ductal diltation prompting an ERCP. ERCP was
performed in [**2187-12-2**] that demonstrated findings
consistent with a Klatskin type tumor and/or stricture
located at the junction of the right and left hepatic ducts.
CT of the abdomen was performed demonstrating a mass located
in the hilum abutting the cystic and the common and hepatic
duct with intrahepatic ductal diltation. Findings were
consistent with cholangiocarcinoma. Also noted was abdominal
lymphadenopathy with no evidence of hepatic disease, no
intrahepatic metastases. Patient underwent brushings at the
time of the ERCP and there was no evidence of malignancy
observed.

Complains of significant pruritus and back pain. Weight loss
of 16 pounds over several weeks. Complains of dark urine. No
chest pain. No shortness of breath. No nausea, vomiting,
fever, chills.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension,
hyperthyroidism, Hodgkin lymphoma status post radiation
treatments, history of questionable pancreatitis and duodenal
ulcer.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Splenectomy and appendectomy.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission HCTZ and Synthroid 150 every day.

ALLERGIES:  Bacitracin and penicillin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 98.4. Blood pressure
178/54. Pulse 84. Respirations 16. Height 5'[**91**]". Weight 142.
HEENT pupils equal, round and react to light. EOMs are full.
Tongue midline. No exudates. Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally. Abdomen positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
no hepatomegaly. Incisions are well healed. No hernias
appreciated. Extremities no CCE.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2188-1-18**] and patient was operated by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] for a
cholecystectomy, common bile duct excision, septoplasty, Roux-
en-Y hepaticojejunostomy, liver biopsy. Please see operative
note from [**2188-1-18**] for more details of the surgery.
Postoperatively, patient went to PACU and then eventually to
the CICU. Patient was intubated on Propofol. Patient received
fluid boluses for low blood pressure. Patient had 2 JP drains
in place. Patient was placed on meropenem, vancomycin and
fluconazole postoperatively. MRS [**Last Name (STitle) 15570**] was performed with a
rectal swab demonstrating staph aureus coag positive. On
[**2188-1-22**], patient had a bronchioloalveolar lavage.
It was noted on chest x-ray that patient had a right main
stem bronchus with narrowing correlated to secretions that
was demonstrated on recent CAT scan on [**1-16**]. On
[**2188-1-22**], the patient had bronchoalveolar lavage
demonstrating staph aureus coag positive. ID was consulted.
Urine culture, blood cultures were obtained on [**2188-1-22**]. Urine culture demonstrate no growth. Blood cultures
demonstrated no growth. On [**2188-1-24**] the patient had
a post pyloric feeding tube placed for nutrition. Patient
continued being ventilated. Levophed was being weaned off.
Nutritional services were consulted for tube feed
recommendations. Patient continued on Vancomycin and
meropenem. Patient was written for Lasix for diuresis.
Patient was eventually extubated. Physical therapy was
consulted. Patient still had JP drain in place and biliary
tube 1 and biliary tube 2.

The patient was continued on antibiotics for MSSA pneumonia
and polymicrobial cholangitis. On [**2188-1-28**], the
patient had a cholangiogram that demonstrated no evidence of
obstruction, extravasation or anastomotic stricture. Labs on
[**2188-1-29**] were 21.3, hematocrit 29.7, platelets 593,
sodium 138, 4.0, 97, 37, 20, 0.5, glucose 111, ALT is 28, AST
46, alkaline phosphatase 66, total bili is 0.3. [**2188-1-24**] bile fluid was sent for gram stain and culture
demonstrating staph aureus coag positive [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans. JP
drain was removed. Diet was advanced. Calorie counts were
obtained. The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2188-1-30**]. Physical therapy continued working with patient.
Patient received Boost t.i.d. On the floor patient received
aggressive chest PT, pulmonary toilet, calorie counts,
bedside swallow to evaluate if he had any problems
swallowing. His abdomen with 3 cm lateral wall defect,
getting wet to dry dressings. Speech had seen him on [**2188-2-1**] demonstrating that he has significant dysphagia at the
bedside. Speech pathologist suggested him to be NPO pending a
video swallow. Barium swallow was notable for a weak tongue,
dysarthria, right Horner and severe dysphagia. Etiology is
unclear, but is likely multifactorial and felt that he should
be NPO and continue tube feeds. It was strongly suggested by
the speech pathologist that neurology see the patient for
dysphagia and other findings including Horner syndrome. They
felt that patient should be NPO and time course of recovery
of swallow is unclear.

Physical therapy continued to work with patient. Calorie
counts from the [**2188-2-5**] demonstrated 370 calories and 9
grams of protein, but food was supplemented with tube feeds.
All drains have been removed. Continues to be afebrile. Vital
signs stable and the patient has been walking around with
physical therapy, done remarkably well. On [**2188-2-5**]
postop day 18, no significant overnight events. Afebrile.
Vital signs stable. Good Is and Os. Abdomen with bowel sounds
soft, nontender, nondistended. Repeat barium swallow is being
performed today. He is being screened by rehab and hopefully
will have a bed very soon. He will be going home on the
following medications, albuterol inhalers 6 puffs every 4
hours p.r.n., Clobetasol propionate 0.05% cream one
application b.i.d. to effected areas. Heparin subQ 5000
b.i.d., insulin sliding scale, levothyroxine 150 mg every
day, Protonix 40 mg every 24. Patient should call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 30335**] if any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, inability to
take medications, any abdominal pain, jaundice, incision
redness/bleeding or purulent discharge, patient to unable eat
or drink or any increased swelling in legs, please call
immediately. Patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], please
call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] for an appointment.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  A 58-year-old male status post Roux-en-Y
hepaticojejunostomy for benign stricture on [**2188-1-28**].

SECONDARY DIAGNOSES:  Dysphagia.

Path results came back on [**2188-1-18**] from the surgery
demonstrating the lymph node shows no malignancies. The
common bile duct distal margin shows acute and chronic
inflammation and fibrosis. Common bile cyst duct and common
bile duct demonstrate acute and chronic inflammation and
fibrosis. Gallbladder with chronic cholecystitis, 2 lymph
nodes that were not malignant. The septum of bifurcation
demonstrated fibrous and granulation tissue with chronic
inflammation and fibrosis and liver needle core biopsy
demonstrated mild portal inflammation with focal bile duct
proliferation, 2 minimal macrovesicular steatosis without
intracellular hyalin or neutrophils. Also trigone stain
increased portal fibrosis, no bridging and iron stain no
stainable iron.

Patient will go to rehab on tube feeds at this point. He will
be going to rehab on Impact with fiber at 3/4 strength, goal
rate is 110 milliliters per hour. Please check residuals
every 4 hours and hold for residuals of greater than 100
milliliters. Also flush with 30 cc of water ever 4 hours.
Patient should receive physical therapy, occupational therapy
in the rehab setting. Also make sure he has pulmonary toilet.
