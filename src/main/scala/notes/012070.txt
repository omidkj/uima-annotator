Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 53 yo female with HTN, ESRD on HD TThS, atrial
fibrillation s/p DCCV, CHF with preserved EF, PVD s/p R fem-[**Doctor Last Name **],
pulmunary HTN, and COPD who presented to the ED with increasing
facial swelling over the course of one month and dizziness,
particularly when lying down. Also, pt reports some difficulty
swallowing due to sensation of swelling in her throat. She
states it began after her last surgery to retrieve retained
graft in left arm late in [**Month (only) 958**]. She states her diet and fluid
status are unchanged. No major medication changes during the
past 1-2 months except decreases in the dose of hypertension
meds. Last dialysis was in the AM of [**2206-5-29**]. Pt also notes mild
increasing abdominal distention.

Of note pt had a infected graft which was removed [**2206-5-2**].

In the ED, concern for SBPs 70-90s. The pt was initially going
to be admitted to the floor but then became hypotensive and was
sent for further evaluation and monitoring in the MICU. Pt
arrived to the MICU hemodynamically stable with SBPs 120-140s so
was called-out to the floor.

ROS: + eye watering, + facial "tightness" with mild HA
especially upon changing positon.  Also feels light-headed upon
changing position.  No recent F/C. No N/V/D or abodminal pain.
No SOB or CP. No urinary symptoms.

[**5-29**] Left upper ext ultrasound:
FINDINGS:  [**Doctor Last Name **] scale, color and pulse Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] was
performed of the subclavian, axillary, brachial, cephalic and
basilic veins.  Normal flow, compression, augmentation and
waveforms were demonstrated.  Of note, the left internal jugular
vein was not well demonstrated on this study although an
adjacent venous structure is identified with normal flow and
compressibility.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of left upper extremity DVT.
Of note, the left internal jugular vein was not well
demonstrated although an adjacent venous structure was noted to
be patent without clots.  This may represent an anatomic
variant.

[**2206-5-30**] CXR
CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours
are stable. Pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.  There is
linear left lower lung atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise
clear.  There are no pleural effusions. Right IJ dialysis
catheter tip is in the distal SVC.  Osseous and soft tissue
structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:  Linear left lower lung atelectasis.  No evidence of
pulmonary edema.

[**2206-5-30**] CTA
IMPRESSION:
1.  Short segment occlusion of the SVC secondary to fibrin
sheath or thrombus around the dialysis catheter.  Numerous large
collateral veins in the upper chest and neck are observed and
the SVC reconstitutes inferiorly through the azygos vein.
2.  Discontinuity of flow through the right subclavian vein
could be secondary to thrombosis or could be related to arm
positioning.
3.  No evidence of PE.
.
SVC gram 4/30/07-1.  Venogram confirms occlusive thrombus from
the right brachiocephalic through mid SVC.
2.  Catheter placed for overnight TPA infusion, per rate
specified in post
procedure orders (0.5 mg/hour).
3.  Repeat venogram and potential balloon dilation planned for
the following day.
.
CTA [**2206-6-7**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2. New ground-glass opacities in the right upper lobe that could
represent a combination of asymmetric pulmonary edema and
infection.
3. New small bilateral pleural effusions.
4. Interval resolution of multiple collaterals in the right
upper chest and neck suggesting that the previous SVC
obstruction has resolved.
.
Head CT [**2206-6-9**]:
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, shift of
normally midline structures, or major vascular territorial
infarct. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved. There
is no hydrocephalus. The visualized paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells are clear. Osseous structures and soft tissues
are unremarkable.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 53 y/o female with ESRD on HD, HTN, and COPD who presents
with left facial swelling x 1 month along with intermittent
hypotension in the ED.

#SVC syndrome: The patient had facial swelling/edema likely [**3-7**]
SVC syndrome. She had a CTA revealing short segment occlusion of
the SVC [**3-7**] to fibrin sheath or thrombus around the HD catheter.
 Patient had an interventional [**Month/Day (2) **] evaluation by venogram.
It confirmed occlusive thrombus from the right brachiocephalic
through mid SVC. A catheter was placed in IR and TPA was
administered overnight in addition to heparin gtt. Laboratory
values including frequent platelet counts, coagulation, and
fibrogren were checked and remained within normal values. The
patient underwent thrombectomy and dilatation of the SVC the
next day, which was HD 5. It preserved flow through the SVC,
although some clot remains. The TPA was d/cd and heparin gtt was
continued until she was therapeutic x24 hours on coumadin.

# Intermittent hypotension- Initially a concern but then
resolved. SBPs 120-140s upon arrival to MICU. Her carvedilol,
amlodipine and lisinopril and were d/cd. Her BP normalized.
After her HD session on day of discharge SBP was ~130. She was
restarted on carvediolol at discharge. The rest may be added
back on as blood pressure
