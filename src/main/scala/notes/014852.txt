1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2) Right hydropneumothoraces with post-op changes.
3) Non-specific patchy opacities in both lungs.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2121-9-18**] 2:05 PM
Increased size of right pneumothorax and slight increased size
of right effusion

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2121-9-18**] 9:37 PM
right internal jugular central venous line tip in SVC. Stable
right pneumothorax cavity after VATS

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2121-9-25**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). Right ventricular
chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated.
The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not stenotic. Mild
(1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

No definite vegetations identified. The absence of a vegetation
by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis if clinically
suggested.

pneumothorax
2) Mild pulmonary edema

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1169**] was admitted to Thoracic Surgery at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2121-9-18**]
via the ED and was immediately intubated for respiratory
distress and hemoptysis.  She subsequently underwent a
fiberoptic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage that same day
which was well-tolerated.  For detaisl of the procedure, please
see operative note.  She was then sent to the SICU for her
respiratory status.  She furthermore had a central venous line,
an A-line, an NGT, foley and 2 pigtail catheters (into right
chest) placed.  Tube feeds were initiated to maintain nutrition.
 She was subsequently started on vancomycin and meropenem on
HD#2 for methicillin resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA) in her
blood, broncheoalveolar lavage secretions and pleural fluid.

On HD#5, she underwent a right thoracosccopic drainage of
empyema and bronchoscopy which was well tolerated.  For details
of the procedure, please see operative note.  Also on HD#5, she
achieved goal tube feeds and was hep-locked.  On HD#7,
Infectious Diseases recommended finishing a 7 days course of the
meropenem and continuing the vancomycin for 4-6 weeks.
Furthermore, they recommended a trans-thoracic echocardiogram
(TTE) to evaluate for possible infectious thrombi/vegetation.
On HD#8, patient underwent a TTE which showed no vegetations.
Please procedural note for more detail.  Also on HD#8, the
patient was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs for a Hct of 25.4 and the
meropenem was discontinued after it's full course.  On HD#9,
patient was extubated and did well.

Throughout her course, patient's intake/output and laboratories
were monitored.  On HD#12, patient was started on lasix gtt for
volume overload.  Also, patient's electrolytes were repleted as
necessary.

On HD#13, a swallowing study was obtained to evaluate for
possible aspiration.  Results were unremarkable and showed an
otherwise normal exam without evidence of aspiration.  On HD#14,
she was deemed stable enough to be sent to the floor where she
continued to improve.

Physical therapy had been consulted and followed the patient to
increase her mobilization, endurance and to work with her
chest/pulmonary status to mobilize secretions.  She tolerated
this well and continually improved throughout her course.  On
HD#18, her pulmonary status had improved significantly and was
deemed in satisfactory condition to be considered for
rehabiliation at an outside facility.  On HD#19, her vancomycin
was discontinued and she was started on levaquin 600mg PO BID
for further coverage of her MRSA.

On HD#22, she was sent to Rehab tolerating a soft diet, and
ambulating with assistance.  She is asked to follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 175**] in 1 week and to obtain a CXR the same day for evaluation
of her pneumothorax.
