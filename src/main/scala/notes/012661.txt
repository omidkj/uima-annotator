Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4318**] was taken to the operating room and underwent a
successful minimally invasive esophagectomy on [**2176-10-10**].  He was
taken to the ICU post-operatively for close monitoring.  His
hospital stay will be dictated by systems.
.
Neuro:  He was initially on a PCA for pain control.  When he was
tolerating tube feeds and given POs, he was switched to oral
pain medications with intermittent IV meds for breakthrough.  He
now has good pain control with PO dilaudid and roxicet.  Due to
his history of a seizure disorder, he was continued on his
seizure meds intravenously and then switch to PO seizure meds
when on tube feeds.  His medication levels were monitored and
were therapeutic.
.
Cardiovascular:  He remained hemodynamically stable throughout
the majority of his hospital stay.  He did develop atrial
fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response requiring IV
metoprolol and an IV amiodarone gtt.  A Cardiology consult was
placed and they assisted in management of his a-fib.  He was
switched to PO lopressor and PO diltiazem with good heart rate
control.  An ECHO showed normal cardiac function.
.
Pulmonary:  His pulmonary status remained stable throughout his
hospital stay.  His oxygen saturations remained stable.  He did
have complaints of right sided chest pain that initially
subsided with pain medication.  This pain persisted so a CTA of
his chest was obtained and it revealed a right middle lobe
subsegmental pulmonary embolus.  He was started on heparin and
then transitioned to coumadin for anticoagulation.
.
GI:  He underwent a successful minimally invasive esophagectomy.
 He was started on tube feeds continuously, which he tolerated,
and was then switched to cycled feeds overnight.  His diet was
advanced and initially he was doing quite well but then had this
persistent right sided chest pain.  This was worked up and he
was noted to have a PE but the pain persisted on
anticoagulation.  Plain films were done to evaluate his
neoesophagus and these were negative for dilatation.  An EGD was
obtained and this showed an ulcer at the anastomotic site.  He
was started on a PPI twice a day and sucralfate.  He does take
some of his meds with sips and ice cream as they cannot be
crushed.  He will have a follow up EGD in about 2 weeks.
.
GU:  He voided without difficulty.  No issues.
.
FEN:  He is on goal tube feeds cycled overnight.  He is to
remain NPO for the most part but he can take meds with sips and
ice cream.
.
ID:  He was started on a course of cefazolin for erythema that
developed around the cervical incision.  The erythema improved
and he was discharged on no antibiotics.  His cultures
throughout his hospital stay have all been negative.
.
Heme:  He was started on a heparin gtt for a RML subsegmental
PE.  He was transitioned to coumadin and on the day of discharge
his INR was 2.1 so he did not need Lovenox injections.  He will
follow up with his PCP's coumadin clinic for INR checks.

sip of water.  You should take nothing by mouth for the most
part, but you can take sips of water or juice for comfort.
.
