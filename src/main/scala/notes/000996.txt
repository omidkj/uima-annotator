Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
Cognitive decline

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bifrontal craniotomy
peg placement
tracheostomy


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 73-year-old female who recently
presented to my outpatient clinic. She had been followed for
decreasing cognitive decline. The patient was worked up
including imaging. A bifrontal large olfactory groove
meningioma measuring 7 x 6 cm was found. The patient was
extensively counseled. Given the family history and the large
extent of the lesion, the decision was made by the brain
tumor conference to resect the lesion for a better prognosis.
The patient was extensively counseled. The patient was
consented. The patient was taken electively to the OR.
Preoperative films had been obtained. The patient was taken
to the operating room on [**2136-8-16**].


Past Medical History:
1. macular degeneration
2. HTN
3. Hypercholesterolemia
4. meningioma


Social History:
Retired dental hygienist. She is married. She lives with her
spouse and her daughter. She does not smoke, She drinks wine
with
dinner. Denies any recreational drugs.


Family History:
Mother died at age [**Age over 90 **] of old age. Father died at age [**Age over 90 **] with
heart disease. Her sister is 71 in good health. She has two
children both in good health.


Physical Exam:
Exam [**2136-9-16**]:

Patient opens eyes to voice.
She does not speak but attempts to stick out her tongue to
command.
PERRL. 3-2 mm bilaterally. The left one is larger initially but
when rechecked is equal to the left.
Motor: Moves left arm spontaneously and squeezes to command.
Moves right arm with noxious stimuli. Withdraws both legs to
noxious stimuli.
Toes upgoing bilaterally.
Her incision has healed well.

Reason: angio w/embolization for bifrontal planum sphenoidale

Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
77 year old woman with bifrontal planum sphenoidale meningioma.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
angio w/embolization for bifrontal planum sphenoidale
meningioma.
TYPE OF STUDY: Cerebral angiogram.

CLINICAL HISTORY: A 77-year-old female with bifrontal planum
sphenoidale meningioma presents for evaluation with angiogram
with possible embolization.

Comparison is made with CT angiogram of the head performed
[**2136-7-3**] and MRI of the brain performed [**2136-7-2**].

TECHNIQUE: Informed consent was obtained from the patient and
the patient's family after explaining the risks, indications,
and alternative management. Risks explained included bleeding,
hemorrhage, stroke, loss of vision and/or speech, injury to
blood vessels and/or nerves, allergic reaction to contrast
material, renal failure, and death. Additionally possible use of
embolization coils if needed was discussed.

The patient was brought to the interventional neuroradiology
suite and placed on the biplane table in the supine position.
Prior to the start of the procedure, a timeout was performed to
verify the patient's identity using two patient identifiers and
the procedure to be performed. Both groins were prepped and
draped in the usual sterile fashion. General anesthesia was
provided by the anesthesiology service. Access to the right
common femoral artery was obtained using a 19-gauge single-wall
needle, under local anesthesia using 1% lidocaine mixed with
sodium bicarbonate with aseptic precautions. Through the needle,
a 0.35 [**Last Name (un) 7648**] wire was introduced and the needle was taken out.
Over the wire, a 5-French vascular sheath was placed and
connected to a saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units and
500 cc of saline) with a continuous drip. Through the sheath, a
4 French Berenstein catheter was introduced and connected to the
continuous saline infusion (with heparin mixture: 1000 units of
heparin and 1000 cc saline). The following vessels were
selectively catheterized and arteriograms were performed from
these locations. After review of the study, the catheter and the
sheath were withdrawn and pressure was applied on the groin
until hemostasis was achieved. The procedure was uneventful and
the patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate
post-procedure related complications. The patient was sent to
the floor with post-procedure orders.

The following blood vessels were selectively catheterized and
arteriograms were obtained in the AP and lateral projections:

1. Right external carotid artery.
2. Right internal carotid artery.
3. Right common carotid artery.
4. Left external carotid artery.
5. Left internal carotid artery.
6. Left common carotid artery.

FINDINGS: Evaluation of the above blood vessels demonstrates no
evidence of aneurysm or vascular malformation.

Upon injection of the right internal carotid artery there is a
large hypervascular mass with a large tumoral blush identified
in the bifrontal region which is largely supplied by the right
anterior ethmoidal and right ophthalmic arteries. Additionally,
upon injection of the left internal carotid artery, there is
identification of this large hypervascular mass to be supplied
by a branch arising from the left paricallosal branch on the
anterior cerebral artery. Additionally, upon injection of the
bilateral external carotid arteries there is minimal
tumor-related blush seen to supply from branches of the
bilateral middle meningeal arteries.

Also, additionally upon injection of the left external carotid
artery there is a hypervascular mass with a prominent
tumor-related blush seen overlying the left frontal lobe. This
hypervascular mass appears to be largely supplied by branches
from the left middle meningeal artery.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large bifrontal hypervascular mass is consistent with
meningioma as reported on prior cross-sectional images which is
larger beings supplied by the right anterior ethmoidal and
ophthalmic arteries and a left branch arising from the left
callosal artery.
2. Large hypervascular mass overlying the left frontal lobe
consistent with a meningioma as correlated with prior
cross-sectional images largely being supplied by branches from
the left middle meningeal artery.

These findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the time of the
examination.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], attending interventional neuroradiologist, was
present and performed the procedure.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
