Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
sulfa or amoxicillin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2291**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is an 87 year old male with PMH of ischemic cardiomyopathy
with an EF of 45% s/p PPM/AICD placement in [**2113**] for AV block,
HTN, recently diagnosed sarcoidosis after a [**Year (4 digits) **] biopsy, and
recent brief admission for bronchiectasis/UTI with discharge on
[**1-14**] now returning with shortness of breath. He was discharged
on a course of ciprofloxacin for UTI/bronchiectasis. He was
doing well at home until a few day ago when he developed
gradually worsening shortness of breath and [**Month/Year (2) **] productive of
clear sputum. His symptoms were exacerbated by activity. He
reports no fevers or chills, no headache, change in vision or
neck pain. He continues to have burning with urination since his
recent diagnosis of UTI, difficulty starting urinary stream.
Denies any abdominal pain, no focal numbness tingling or
weakness, no rash. This episode of shortness ofbreath was more
severe than his previous.

On admission from [**1-13**] to [**1-14**], patient presented with acute
onset shortness of breath with [**Month/Year (2) **] productive of whitish
sputum without fever or leukocytosis, felt to be consistent with
bronchiectasis flare. Sxs resolved overnight so pt was
discharged on ciprofloxacin to be completed on [**1-23**].

In the ED, initial VS were: 98.0, 86, 107/50, 22, 100% 4L Nasal
Cannula. He then became hypoxic to the 80s and tachypneic to the
30s, but was never hypotensive. Exam was notable for diffuse
rhonchi, no JVD, trace LE edema, and patient was placed on
non-rebreather to maintain sats in the low 90s. He was then
placed on BiPap and unable to be weaned. EKG was at baseline.
Labs notable for a lactate of 2. CXR was unremarkable. He
received Combivent, albuterol nebs x 2, 125mg of IV solumedrol,
40mg IV lasix, and 750mg IV levofloxacin.

On arrival to the MICU, patient was breathing comfortably on
bipap which was placed in the ED in the late afternoon. He
reports improvement since arrival on bipap. He soon became
tachypneic to 50s and uncomfortable. ABG was obtained at 1AM and
showed 7.46/45/57/bicarb=33 with no previous comparison. He was
transitioned to high flow oxygen shortly after arriving. He
continues to have burning with urination despite treatment for
his UTI with cipro.

Past Medical History:
bradycardia - with primary AV block s/p AICD and pacer placement
Recurrent urethral strictures [**12-29**] childhood infection
Mild systolic dysfunction - EF of 40-45% on Echo in [**2110**]
Chronic [**Year (4 digits) **], congestion and hoarseness with referral for
possible sarcoidosis.
Chronic sinusitis.
Osteoarthritis.
Right knee surgery.
Defibrillator/pacemaker.


Social History:
Denies smoking, alcohol use, recreational drug use. Lives at
home with wife.


Family History:
Father died of CVA; sister has [**Name (NI) 4278**].

IMAGING:

ECHO [**2119-1-23**]:
The left atrium is elongated. No right-to-left shunt is seen on
intravenous saline injection at rest. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35-40 %), but the
apical half of the ventricle is not well seen. The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the [**Month/Day/Year **] level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Mild
mitral regurgitation. No right-to-left intracardiac shunt
identified. Dilated ascending aorta.
Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review)
of [**2111-6-12**], the severeity of mitral regurgitation may be
somewhat reduced and global systolic function is slightly worse.


CXR [**2119-1-21**] MPRESSION: Increased retrocardiac density consistent
with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, worse
compared with [**2119-1-19**].

Bilateral LENIS [**2119-1-19**]:
IMPRESSION: Nonocclusive thrombus within the distal left common
femoral vein extending to the proximal superficial femoral vein.


CT Chest [**1-13**]: Bilateral bronchiectasis with bronchial wall
thickening consistent with a bronchial inflammatory process.
Again noted is right middle lobe loss of volume with a
peripheral consolidation which may represent atelectasis, but
malignancy cannot be excluded. Dedicated chest CT is again
recommended in 3 months. Stable lung nodules

Microbiology:
Blood cultures [**2119-1-19**]: pending
URINE CULTURE ([**2119-1-19**]):    <10,000 organisms/ml.
Urine culture [**2119-1-21**]: no growth

Speech and Swallow Eval [**2119-1-23**]:
This swallowing pattern correlates to a Functional Oral Intake
Scale (FOIS) rating of 5.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Ground consistency solids with thin liquids.
2. Meds whole with water.
3. TID oral care.
4. Recommended video swallow and barium swallow as outpatient
for
further evaluation of symptoms. To schedule, please call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 97885**].
