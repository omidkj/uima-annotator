Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
upper GI bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with cautery [**2167-2-7**]


History of Present Illness:
83M with AF on Coumadin, Ischemic CMP, EF 20%, recently admitted
[**Date range (1) 24729**] with cholecystitis and choledocholithiasis s/p ERCP
[**2-4**] with removal of CBD stone and sphincterotomy that
presented to the ED today with lightheadedness and one episode
of dark red blood per rectum night prior to admission, this was
later complicated by PEA arrest in the ERCP suite this
afternoon.
.
The pt originially presented to an OSH on [**2167-1-27**] for abdominal
discomfort, vomiting and SSCP. At the OSH the pt was febrile,
blood cultures revealed pansensitive E.coli. AST 343, ALT 269,
TB 5.4. A RUQ u/s was without evicence of gallstones, no intra
or extrahepatic dilation. HIDA ([**2167-1-30**]) and showed
non-opacification of the gallbladder, consitant with acute
cholecystitis. Pt then sent to [**Hospital1 18**] and on [**2167-2-4**] underwent
ERCP where they extracted CBD stone and performed a
sphincterotomy and sphincteroplasty  without complication. The
patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids and
antibiotics.
.
The pt was discharged on [**2-4**] and last night had three episodes
of large stools BRBPR and melanotic stools. The pt complained of
lightheadedness to his son who then this morning had his father
come to an OSH [**Name (NI) **] and then and sent over to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the emergency department, initials VS 95.8 97 85/47 20 96%RA.
His nitro patch was removed. INR was 1.4 and he was given
Vitamin K. Patient evaluated by ERCP who felt bleeding may be
related to ERCP and are planning repeat ERCP. He had NG lavage
with coffee grounds on return. SBP dropped to 80s and he
received 1400cc NS with improved SBP to 100. The patient was
seen briefly in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where his vitals were 96.9 76 155/110
18 on RA. The patients abdominal exam was benign at the time.
The patient was subsequently sent to ERCP for cauterization of
the patient sphincterotomy site
.
At 3:25 at Code Blue was called in for a PEA arrest during the
patients ERCP. During the code the pt underwent CPR for
approximately 5 minutes at which time a pulse was detected. The
pt was given a total of 4mg of Epinephrine boluses. The pt was
started on an Epinephrine gtt, Neosynephrine gtt and Dopamine
gtt while he received a total of 5 units of pRBCs. The patient
was brought to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where he was able to be weaned off the
pressors. The pts pH fell to 7.03/35/117 with a bicarb of 9. The
pt received at total of 7 units of pRBCs (1 in the ED and 6 post
code), 1 bag of platelets, 2 of FFP (INR of 1.9 -> 1.4), Calcium
Gluconate (total of 4mg) and 1 amp of Bicarb.
.
A meeting was held with the patients children that stated to
continue to treat aggresively, however they stated that they
would not wish their father to receive further chest
compressions or shocks.

IMAGING
CXR: The hardware is unchanged in position. The heart is again
enlarged. The lungs are clear. No effusions are seen. No
evidence of volume overload.
.
TTE:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis/akinesis (inferior/inferolateral
akinesis/hypokinesis, apical akinesis/dyskinesis and hypokinesis
elsewhere) (LVEF = 15-20 %). No thrombus is seen but a left
ventricular mass/thrombus cannot be definitively excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with probably mildly
depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root is moderately
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**2-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
.
ERCP:
Blood in the major papilla - this was successfully treated with
epinephrine and cautery. Partial cholangiogram showed normal
biliary tree. A biliary stent was placed.
Procedure was terminated due to hypotension.

(stent placement)(injection, hemostasis)
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum
.
Echo [**2167-2-10**]:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-30%) with regional
variation (there is extensive apical akinesis with focal
dyskinesis; the rest of the left ventricle is hypokinetic). An
apical mural thrombus is present. The clot is mural and not
mobile. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened; there is mild mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2167-2-7**], an apical thrombus is now identified (may
have been present before, but less well-visualized).
