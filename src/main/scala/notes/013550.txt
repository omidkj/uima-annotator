Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9554**]
Chief Complaint:
fatigue, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
25 year old woman with history of anemia, GERD (H. pylori),
Bell's palsy, BRBPR, and several episodes of malaria who was
recently admitted [**Date range (1) 25340**] for newly diagnosed dilated
cardiomyopathy presents today as a direct admit for worsening
chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion for close
monitoring via placement of a swan ganz catheter.

The patient was relatively healthy until about four years ago
(after she had had her most recent miscarriage) when she began
to notice some fatigue.  Her exercise tolerance began to slowly
decrease from that point - when she was able to walk >4 miles,
to about 2 years ago when she was able to walk up a couple of
flights of stairs to the past few months when she isn't very
active so is unsure about how far she can walk before fatiguing.
 She began to notice a real decline in [**Month (only) 205**] of this year, and
also began to notice chest pain/tightness and shortness of
breath.  Over the next months this chest pain has been present
all the time, but increases in intensity nearly every day,
usually at night.  Over the past several days she has been
unable to sleep secondary to the pain.  It is substernal, sharp
and radiates to her back via her left side; it is associated
with palpitations, and has a pleuritic component.
She also notes lightheadedness and dizzyness especially with
standing.  She denies diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting.  She has
some abdominal cramping and has a history of GERD and gastritis
to which she atrributes these symptoms.  She denies fever,
weight loss, travel to places other [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Country 6607**] in the past
year, recent viral syndromes, alcohol use, drug use.  Other
positive ROS include: recent [**3-15**] week 2 pillow orthopnea, air
hunger at night - she will wake up gasping for air and has taken
to keeping her window open at night, increased urination in the
mornings. She denies recent episodes of inactivity (long plane
or car trips), and denies recent OCP use.

Past Medical History:
1. Anemia - what type of work up?  Has been on Fe in the past
(since fatigue began) without much improvement of symptoms.
2. GERD - patient relates that she was H. pylori positive and
was treated with a [**1-24**] day course of antibiotics with good
resolution of sx sub subsequently.  She still notes epigastric
pain about once a week.
3. Bell's Palsy - occurred earlier this year in the context of
an ear and sinus infection.  She had paralysis of the left side
of her face from [**Month (only) 956**] to [**Month (only) 116**] with spontaneous resolution.
4.  Blood in stool - she relates BRBPR in the past, and was
scheduled for a colonoscopy to work this up on [**10-21**].
5. History of several episodes of malaria.

Social History:
The patient used to smoke casually (she estimates 1 pack per
year) but quit in [**Month (only) **] when her chest pain began.  She very
occasionally drinks but has not had any recent binges.  She
denies IVDU.  She took a weight loss medication, "hydrocut" (?)
with ephedra last year for a two week period, but has not tried
any other herbal or non prescription medications.

From previous OMR notes, the patient has had a difficult time
over the past few years with episodes of homelessness.
Currently she is living in an apartment with roommates, and
working.  She is going to take some courses at a community
college this fall.

Family History:
Her brother has recently been told he has an irregular heart
rhythm but has not had it worked up as of yet.

CXR ([**10-19**])
unchanged from prior (prior had ?vascular abnormality in right
hilum but otherwise unremarkable)

Chest CT ([**10-20**])
IMPRESSION:
1) No evidence of hilar lymphadenopathy or vascular anomaly. No
evidence of sarcoidosis.
2) Left renal cyst.
3) Collection of air in the right upper quadrant, most likely
representing duodenum, however, please correlate with physical
examination.

ECHO ([**10-14**])
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction
30-40 percent). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No objective evidence of myocardial ischemia by EKG
in the
setting of atpyical anginal symptoms and shortness of breat at a
moderate absolute workload.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: 25 year old woman with a 4 year history of
progressive fatigue and recent chest pain, palpitations, and
signs of volume overload (orthopnea, PND, increased AM
urination, air hunger) who has been recently diagnosed with
cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology and partially worked up.  She
was admitted for further workup and possible invasive monitoring
via swan ganz catheter.

Cardiovascular
1. Rate/rhythm - During her hospitalization, the patient was in
sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs and ventricular bigeminies.  She
was seen by EP.  She was discharged with a plan to get a "[**Doctor Last Name **]
of hearts" 24 hour monitor next week and she will call to
arrange a convenient day for this.  Apparantly when seen in
clinic prior to admission her heart rate was in the 30s, but she
remained in the 60-90s while admitted.  Given this history,
however, her Toprol was held and she was continued on just
Lisinopril.  She was discharged home on her outpatient regimen,
with plans to follow up with her primary care physician on the
21st after she has undergone the monitoring as well as the
cardiac MRI (see below).
2. Pump - On an ECHO done on [**2140-10-14**], the patient's EF was
30-40%; however, the patient was in ventricular bigeminy during
the procedure making the EF results questionable.  She also
presented with s/s CHF, and was initially admitted for possible
swan placement to determine filling pressures.  However, her
clinical presentation on admission was relatively stable, and
invasive monitoring was decided against.  She was instead gently
diuresed with IV lasix, and monitored closely.  She had a
negative fluid balance duri
