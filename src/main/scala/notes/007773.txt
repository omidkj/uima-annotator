Five days PTA, the pt flew to St. [**Doctor First Name **] and was in his USOH. His

On the day prior to admission, he returned to [**Location 86**]. He first
noticed "not feeling well" on the plane trip from St. [**Doctor First Name **] to
[**Male First Name (un) 1056**]. By the time he had to get on the plane in [**Country **]
[**Country **], he reports that he could hardly stand. When he arrived
home on the evening PTA, he could not stay awake and went to
sleep.

He awoke at 4 a.m. on the day of admission and vomited once,
clear liquid. He then began to have loose stool, and his wife
called their primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] brought him to the
[**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] ED. There, he rapidly deteriorated. A groin line
was placed, and he received aggressive fluid resuscitation,

He reports only a mild cough and some diarrhea as noted above.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course
-----------

Mr. [**Known lastname **] was weaned off pressors (levophed + vasopressin) by
morning of [**7-26**]; BP's stable with SBP in the 80-90's and fluid
responsive, satting in the mid 90's on 2 L NC. A chest CTA was
ordered to further evaluate the pneumonia and to rule out PE.
His symptoms had improved such that he was denying pleuritic
chest pain or SOB.  He was continued on empiric vanco 1 g IV
Q12, azithromycin 500 mg IV Q24 and levofloxacin 750 mg IV QD
while cultures were pending.  Dexamethasone was discontinued on
[**7-26**] because Mr. [**Known lastname **] passes the [**Last Name (un) **] Stim test.

Pt continued to have dropping O2 sats and respiratory distress,
so he was intubated on HD#3.  He was continued on
vanco+levo+azithro pending cultures, and flagyl was added on
HD#3 for possible aspiration pna.  [**Location (un) 620**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] for the
results of blood cx drawn there, which showed NGTD.  Pt
self-extubated, then re-intubated, and increased on sedation
while on mechanical ventilation.  Mini-BAL and bronchoscopy with
lavage showed many PMNs but no microorganisms, and Cx show NGTD.
 Pt continued to spike through antibiotics, so ID was consulted,
who recommended changing the antibiotic regimen:  azithro and
flagyl were discontinued, and clindamycin was started on HD#5.
Pt again self-extubated and re-intubated, finally extubated on
HD#6.  Pt also noted to be anemic, with retic lower than
expected, but iron studies, folate, and vitamin b12 near-normal.
 Pt complained of headache once extubated, usually takes
excedrin [**10-30**]/day at home, allowed to continue treatment with
his own excedrin.  Had 1 episode of CP on morning of [**7-29**]
chest tightness, responded to SL NTGx3 and 1mg of Morphine,
never any changes on ECG.

Floor course
-----------
Pt was transferred to the floor, CP never resurfaced again and
serial troponins were negative.  ABx were initially continued
but [**8-1**] we swtiched to oral clindamycin and levofolaxcin.  Pt
recovered quickly on the floor; on [**8-1**] pt went from using 5.5L
of oxygen to no oxygen requirement, foley was pulled, and plans
to place peripheral IV were made in order to d/c central line;
however since pt refused peripheral IV placement, then central
line had to be continued until discharge.  At the time of
discharge pt was afebrile, satting well off oxygen, eating,
doing well with PT (walking stairs etc), and voiding on his own.
