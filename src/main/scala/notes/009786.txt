Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9569**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
The pt. is a 85 year-old male with multiple medical problems who
was found unresponsive at his [**Hospital3 **] facility.  Per
notes, the pt. was found lying on the floor by his neighbor the
morning of admission.  He was noted to be cyanotic and his blood
pressure was noted to be 80/40.

He was originally treated at an OSH ED where he was determined
to be in rapid atrial fibrillation and found to be hypotensive
(systolic BP in the 60's).  A chest X-ray was performed which
was suggestive of CHF and a urinalysis was sent which was
consistent with a urinary tract infection.  He was also found to
be hyperkalemic and was treated with insulin, D50, and
bicarbonate.  He was given 500cc of normal saline and was
started on levofloxacin and gentamicin.  A head CT was performed
and was negative for any acute intracranial process. A CK and
troponin were noted to be "negative."

He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.  In
the ED, his blood pressure was 70/40 on arrival.  His
temperature was 100.4 rectally.  He was initiated on the sepsis
protocol and he underwent placement of a central venous catheter
and received 250cc of IV fluid.  A lactate was found to be 2.2.
He was given one unit of PRBCs for a hematocrit of 28.  He was
also started on a levophed drip.  He was admitted to the ICU for
treatment of a CHF exacerbation, atrial fibrillation and
possible urosepsis.

On presentation to the MICU, the pt. offered no specific
complaints other than fatigue.  He was unable to recall the
events surrounding the fall which led to his admission.  He
stated that he has not felt well over the last week,
specifically that he has been experiencing increasing dyspnea
and PND.  He denied orthopnea.  He also c/o dysuria over the
past week.  He denied chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
BRBPR, melena.  He denied dietary indiscretion.  He has been
taking all of his medications as prescribed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is an 85 year-old man with a history of CAD s/p
CABG, left ventricular systolic dysfunction with EF of 25%,
history of atrial fibrillation admitted from an OSH after being
found unresponsive at [**Hospital3 **] facility. On transfer he
was hypotensive with low grade fever.  He was initially admitted
to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU.  The following issues were addressed on this
admission.

Concerning his cardiovascular disease: Concerning ischemic
disease.  He has a history of CAD s/p CABG and was ruled out
here. Troponins and CK's remained flat.  OSH reported no
elevation in enzymes.  His troponins were from 0.04-0.06
attributed to demand from heart failure and rapid atrial
fibrillation. He was maintained on aspirin, statin.  ACE
inhibition was added once patient's pressures stabilized.
Unable to add beta-blockade given low pressures.

Concerning his pump function: Patient with depressed EF
estimated 25%.  Echo here demonstrated echo less than 20% but
this was in setting of decompensation.  Also has 3+MR/ moderate
to severe AS.  Patient admitted with low pressures and RVR to
afib.  In ICU low pressures felt likely due to urosepsis vs.
heart failure.  Patient first treated for urosepsis with sepsis
protocol with pressors.  He was not diuresed and other load
medications could not be initiated with continued low pressors.
Never with swan placed.  Once he was stabilized in ICU and felt
not to be septic, weaned from pressors, patient transferred to
floor afebrile, but still with low pressures.  Felt to be
decompensated heart failure.  Patient initially placed on lasix
and dopamine but patient had lots of increased ectopy and
continued low pressures so both were stopped.  As pressures came
up with no intervention, lasix iv and ace were added.   Patient
then diuresed and drastically improved.  Patient's oxygen
requirement resolved and now satting 99% room air.  Also with no
orthopnea, creatinine rising slightly (in normal range), and
exam greatly improved with decreaed edema and only minimal
basilar crackles.  Patient transitioned to current ACE/lasix
levels.  His pressures continue to run low (high 80's-low 90's
systolic) and these pressures should be tolerated.  The patient
needs afterload reduction with ACE inhibition and daily lasix to
remain euvolemic, esp. given 3+MR and AS.  His actual EF is very
low given MR/AS.
Should continue lasix, ace and add beta-blocker as blood
pressures/heart rates can tolerate.  Also titrate ace as
possible, down-titrate lasix as needed if patient becoming dry,
especially if creatinine rising and add beta-blocker (was at
12.5 metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] on admit and lisinopril 15 on admit.)
Patient also should be maintained on spirinolactone.

Concerning his rhythm: The patient admitted in afib with RVR.
No attempts made to cardiovert given large atrium and long
history of afib, veyr unlikely that he could be cardioverted.
Beta-blockade and calcium channel inhibition could not be
utilized due to low pressures.  Digixon was maintained with good
rate control.
OF NOTE: The patient had runs of SVT with aberrancy vs. Vtach on
telemetry.  EP was consulted numerous times to evaluate these
rhythms.  All were felt to due to SVT with aberrancy.  We will
attach copies of tele strips for comparison.
Continue to monitor dig levels, they have been around 0.8 to low
1.0's here. Goal is right around 1.0.  Normal TSH and free T4.
Concerning anticoag: holding coumadin for afib given guiaic
positive stools.  Patient was not on coumadin previously, with
known afib because of h
