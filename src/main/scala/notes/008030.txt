Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma service. Neurosurgery, Plastics
and Orthopedics were consulted given her multiple injuries. Her
subdural hemorrhage was managed non operatively; serial head CT
scans were done and remained stable. Her Coumadin was placed on
hold and should be withheld 2 weeks from injury date ([**2147-5-29**])
per neurosurgery recommendations. It was cleared by neurosurgery
to initiate Heparin subcutaneously for DVT prophylaxis. Follow
up in 4 weeks with a repeat head CT scan.

Her facial fractures were evaluated by Plastics and were also
non operative. A soft diet was recommended so as to not further
displace the zygomatic fracture. She will follow up in [**Hospital 3595**]
clinic in 1 month.

On [**6-2**] she was taken to the operating room for external fixation
of her distal right radius fracture. Her left comminuted humerus
fracture was managed non operatively, she was placed in a
[**Last Name (un) 8688**] brace. She is non weight bearing on both upper
extremities. Follow up next week in [**Hospital 5498**] clinic.

She was evaluated by Speech and Swallow and because of
dysphagia; a bedside swallow was done where she did show signs
of aspiration. It was recommended that she have 1:1 supervision
at all meals and that an oral diet of nectar thick liquids and
pureed solids be given and pills crushed. Her home medications
were restarted.

Physical and Occupational therapy consults were also placed and
