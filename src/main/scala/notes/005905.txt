ADDENDUM:  Please refer to the previously dictated Discharge
Summary covering the period from [**2151-1-5**] until
[**2151-1-22**].  That Discharge Summary has been
incorrectly dated [**2123-4-12**] on the on-line record system.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 27-year-old
gentleman injured on [**2150-12-28**] when his left arm was
caught in a power shaft in a blue [**Doctor Last Name **] picking machine.  At
that time, his left arm was fully amputated to the shoulder.
He was taken by medical flight to an outside hospital in
[**State 1727**].  He was intubated on arrival.

The patient was diagnosed with the following orthopaedic
injuries:  (1)  a left hip dislocation and fracture,
intertrochanteric, comminuted; (2) a comminuted fracture of
the left proximal tibia, tibial plateau; (3)  a fracture of
the right humerus; (4)  dislocation of the right elbow; (5)
right radial nerve palsy; (6)  bilateral pneumothoraces; (7)
bilateral foot drop; (8)  right sternoclavicular dislocation;
and, (9)  right leg cellulitis.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM
(CONTINUED):  The following covers the hospital course from
[**2151-1-22**] through [**2151-1-27**].

The patient had an uneventful hospital course from [**2151-1-22**] until [**2151-1-25**] when he had his open
reduction/internal fixation of his right humerus fracture.
He was seen by Physical Therapy as well as Occupational
Therapy.  He was continued on Lovenox for anticoagulation.

On [**2151-1-25**] the patient was taken to the operating
room for intramedullary rod procedure of his right humerus.
This was done without complications, and the patient was
thereafter transferred to the floor for continued care.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient had the
appropriate increase in pain from his right upper extremity
for which he was medicated.  Discharge planning was
initiated.

He was seen in followup by the Neurology team regarding his
right radial nerve palsy as well as his bilateral foot drop.
Neurology noted that there was some improvement in the
patient's right radial nerve palsy, but no significant change
in his right foot drop.  The Neurology team recommended
outpatient electromyogram and nerve conduction studies one to
two months following discharge if no significant improvement
was noted.  The patient was to call telephone number
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 558**] to make an appointment for these studies if
needed.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  It was expected that the patient will
be transferred to a rehabilitation facility close to his home
in [**State 1727**] on [**2151-1-27**].

retained mucous and secretions in the right lower lobe (on
[**2151-1-11**]).
3.  Left tibial plateau fracture repair (on [**2151-1-18**]).
4.  Open reduction/internal fixation of right humerus
fracture (on [**2151-1-25**]).

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was instructed to follow up with a plastic
surgeon near his home area in [**State 1727**] for monitoring of his

following discharge.
2.  The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4304**]
[**Name (STitle) 284**] for further management of his tibial fracture.
3.  The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
further management of his right humerus fracture.
4.  The patient was instructed to follow up with a
neurologist for possible electromyogram or nerve conduction
study if his bilateral foot drops do not improve.
5.  The patient was instructed to follow up with his primary
care physician.
