CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2174-12-6**] 12:16 AM

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT 150CC NONIONIC CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1) No pulmonary embolus detected.

2) Consolidative and ground-glass opacities in the lingula and
right upper lobe may represent pneumonia. Irregular right lower
lobe consolidative opacity is also noted. Follow-up examination
after treatment should be considered within three months to
assess for change or resolution.

3) Emphysema.

4) Calcified pleural plaques suggesting prior asbestos exposure.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2174-12-6**] 2:57 AM

IMPRESSION:
1) Internal jugular line in right atrium.
2) Probable mild failure. Patchy opacities in both lungs may
represent pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
68M with hx COPD (>100 pack-years), HTN, prostate CA s/p
bilateral orchectomy p/w  cough and pleuritic CP. The patient
noted that he developed the cough on [**11-25**], and that it
initially improved over the weekend, but then yesterday got
dramatically worse.  The MUST protocol was initiated after his
SBP 74 did not increase significantly with 3L NS.  Levophed GTT
was started.  He was given combivent/albuterol nebs, azithro/CTX
for CAP, solumedrol 125mg IV, toradol 30mg IV.  His exam in the
ED was notable for diffuse expiratory wheezes. CXR was normal
initially, repeat for RIJ confirmation also showed RLL
infiltrate.  He was placed on droplet precautions for flu. CTA
was negative for PE/dissection, notable for emphysema, calcified
pleural plaques suggesting asbestos exposure, and ground-glass
opacities in the lingula possibly c/w infection, and irregular
RLL consolidative opacity. EKG was notable for sinus tachy at
114, no changes.  Admitted to MICU on [**12-6**] for sepsis/pneumonia.
Ceftriaxone and azithromycin continued.  Stress dose steroids
with hydrocortisone 50mg IV q6h started.  After 1 day in MICU,
dramatically improved with no oxygen or pressor requirement.
Tolerating POs.  No wheezes on exam.  Transferred to medicine
[**Company 191**].  Prednisone and azithromycin continued.  Started on
atrovent, fluticasone, and serovent MDI.  Received nursing
