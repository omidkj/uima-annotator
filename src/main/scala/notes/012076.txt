CXR: IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis

1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic pathology.
2. Mild bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
3. Hepatic steatosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 47 yo with obesity hypoventilation and severe OSA
presenting with subjective fevers, headache, and found to have
hypoxemia and hypercarbia (baseline) on admission.
.
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's PaO2 was 53 on admission. He had
some brief desaturations, but he was very easy to oxygenate on
nasal canula. The patient had a CXR that only showed bibasilar
atelectasis. Due to his A-a gradient and a positive D dimer, the
patient had a CTA that did not show a PE. The patient was weaned
to his home O2 requirement and he was not hypoxic. He remained
hypercarbic, secondary to his obesity and sleep apnea, but this
was not significantly different than his baseline and his
mentation remained stable. The patient had an elevated bicarb,
c/w his chronic resp acidosis. The patient was fitted with a
BiPap mask overnight, which he tolerated okay. He says that he
is more comfortable with his mask that he has at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 42905**].
The patient was kept on his home dose lasix and metolazone and
had good urine output and normal electrolytes. He was placed on
a low salt diet. The patient was maintained on his inhalers.
.
2. Fever - tmax 99.2 at rehab. Afebrile here. All culture data
is negative and chest xray was not concerning for infection
.
3. Headache: Has chronic migraines. No signs or symptoms of
menigitis. The patient had a normal Tegretol level and his
headache did not recur. The patient is continued on
Carbamazepine.
.
4 Schozaffective disorder: Continued home meds of Doxepin,
Risperidone, Benxtropine.
.
5. HTN: The patient was continued on Metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] and
Lisinopril 2.5mg Qday. The patient is also on Lasix and
Metolazone.
.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient remains on Aspirin 325mg, colace.
.
The patient has chronic hypercarbia.  He was sent back to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 42905**] with the BiPap mast he used during this hospitalization.
 He will need to be extremely compliant with his CPAP. The
patient was also wondering about a portable O2 tank for when he
leaves the facility. All culture data will be reported if
positive.
