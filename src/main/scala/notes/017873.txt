CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a chief
complaint of headache since noon time, acute onset during
lunch.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old white
female who presented to the emergency room earlier on the
evening of admission with a history of having been found down
by her laundry at approximately 6:00 p.m. this evening with
confusion and question of mental status changes.  The family
had found her down.  Upon EMS transport and arrival at [**Hospital1 1444**], she was able to relate the
story of the relatively acute onset of a headache which
developed while having lunch on the day of admission.  She
complained of persistent headache with mild associated
nausea, but no vomiting.  She was last seen in early to
mid-afternoon and then was found down at 6:00 p.m.  CT scan
in the emergency room showed a large amount of subarachnoid
hemorrhage.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  CVA in [**2094**].  History of long standing
left bundle branch block.  She denied history of seizure
disorder.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

MEDICATIONS:  Included vitamin E, vitamin C, aspirin one per
day.

ALLERGIES:  She had no known allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Included the fact that she lived alone.  Was
an elderly patient in [**Hospital3 **] and supportive
environment with supportive family.  She was a nonsmoker with
a negative alcohol history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs were 95.2, 181/93, 95, 18,
96% saturation.  Neuro exam showed her to be awake, alert and
oriented times one, she knew her name.  She did not recognize
the place or the day or date.  Head was normocephalic,
atraumatic.  Neck was supple with full range of motion.  No
meningismus was present.  Left pupil was 2.5 mm and
nonreactive post surgical.  Right was 1.25 mm and nonreactive
post surgical.  Extraocular movements intact.  Visual fields
were full to confrontation grossly.  Smile was equal.  Tongue
was midline.  She had dry mucous membranes.  Face was
symmetric with V1 through 3 intact.  Cranial nerves II-XII
were also grossly intact.  On mental status she was slightly
confused, thought she was at [**Hospital3 43992**] in [**Location (un) 3146**] and
that it was, indeed, [**2104-8-21**].  She offered a mildly
inconsistent history regarding the onset of her symptoms, but
she repeated test phrases well and followed all simple one
and two step commands.  She faltered on three step commands
two out of three times.  She was moving all extremities
throughout a full range of motion.  Strength was [**5-25**] in all
major muscle groups of bilateral upper and lower extremities
equally.  Sensory exam was intact to light touch.  Plantar
responses were mute bilaterally or mildly downgoing
bilaterally.  There was no ankle clonus.  Deep tendon
reflexes were 1+ throughout.  Gait and Romberg were not
tested.  Finger to nose was slow, but without any dysmetric
movements.  General physical exam including chest, heart,
abdomen, extremities and skin was essentially unremarkable.

LABORATORY DATA:  At the time of admission white count was
16.7, hematocrit 41.4, platelets 287.  Chem-7 was within
normal limits.  Coags were within normal limits.  CPK was
123, troponin less than 0.3, CKMB 6.  Head CT at that time
showed diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage.  A CT angiogram was
done at that time urgently and found a large, bilobular, 15
mm tall by 11 mm wide, right, anterior, communicating artery
aneurysm with a narrow neck.  The above findings were
discussed by phone with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the attending
neurovascular neurosurgeon.  He came to the emergency room
and patient was quickly taken to the angiogram suite that
evening for possible coil embolization in the next few hours
following admission.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was, indeed, taken to
angiography and underwent angiogram and coiling of the
aneurysm.  Patient tolerated the procedure well.  Initial
post-angiogram and post-coiling course was unremarkable.  She
was noted to be moving all extremities spontaneously.  Pupils
were 3.5 on the left surgical, right 1.5 trace reactive, but
surgical.  However, there was no other movement to painful
stimulus in the lower extremities.  She was, therefore, taken
for an urgent noncontrast CT scan which showed good position
of the coils.  On the following day she was noted to be more
awake and moving all extremities.  Pupils were unchanged.
She was following all commands.

At 6:00 p.m. on [**9-11**] patient was awake and alert in the
ICU and an extra-ventricular drain was placed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 35957**], chief neurosurgery resident, under sterile
conditions.  Patient tolerated the procedure well.  Opening
pressure transduced at 19 and the ventricular drain was set
at 10 cm above the tragus.  On the 23rd she was noted to be
moving extremities, but not following commands.  Therefore,
she was taken to the angiogram suite for urgent diagnostic
angiogram to rule out spasm.  Angiogram showed a small amount
of spasm and papaverine was injected at that time.  On the
24th she was noted to be more awake and again moving all
extremities and following some simple commands.  On the 25th
she was awake and attentive to the examiner, was trying to
mouth words, moved all extremities purposefully, but did not
follow commands.  Patient remained stable in this condition.
On the 27th she became hypertensive and sedation was
increased and patient was subsequently placed back on full
ventilatory support.  She became nonresponsive at that time
and after discussion with the family, patient was changed to
DNR status.

On the 29th patient remained on ventilatory support, but was
noted to be attentive to examiner mildly, grimacing to pain
and localizing right arm to pain and withdrawing legs
briskly.  Patient remained DNR at that time.  For the
remainder of the patient's postoperative hospitalization, her
neurologic examination essentially remained unchanged.  After
several days of this, the family made a decision to withdraw
care due to the gravity of patient's serious neurologic
condition.  Patient was subsequently changed to comfort
measures only on the afternoon of [**9-27**] and she died
peacefully on the morning of [**9-28**] and was pronounced
at 4:07 a.m. on the 8th.
