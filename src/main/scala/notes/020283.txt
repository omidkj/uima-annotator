Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2126-5-1**] - Coronary artery bypass graft x 3, with left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery,
reversed single vein graft from the aorta to the first obtuse
marginal coronary artery, and reversed single vein graft from
the aorta to the posterior descending coronary artery.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 73-year-old male with significant peripheral vascular
disease, who had been complaining of some new onset of angina.
Upon further workup, he underwent a catheterization which
revealed left main disease as well as an occluded right coronary
artery. Based on these findings, it was recommended that the
patient undergo coronary artery bypass grafting.

Pertinent Results:
[**2126-5-1**] ECHO: Prebypass: 1. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. 2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesia of the mid and apical portions of the anterior wall
and anterior septum.. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 to 45% %). 3.Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 4.There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 5.The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 6.The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 7.Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**2126-5-1**] at
1000am. Post bypass: 1. Patient is being A paced and receving an
infusion of phenylephrine. 2. LV systolic function 45%. 3. Aorta
intact post decannulation. 4. Mild mitral regurgitation
persists.

[**2126-5-6**] Abd. X-RAY: An OG tube and side hole is seen to project
below the diaphragm essentially unchanged position. Again seen
are multiple distended loops of small and large bowel, including
gas seen in the rectum. Multiple cerclage wires are again seen
in the midline. Lung bases are essentially clear. No gross
osseous abnormality.

[**2126-5-5**] CXR: An OG tube and side hole is seen to project below
the diaphragm essentially unchanged position. Again seen are
multiple distended loops of small and large bowel, including gas
seen in the rectum. Multiple cerclage wires are again seen in
the midline. Lung bases are essentially clear. No gross osseous
abnormality.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2126-5-1**] for surgical
management of his coronary artery disease. He was taken directly
to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to three vessels. Please see operative note for
details. Within 24 hours, he had awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated. Beta blockade, aspirin, Lipitor and Plavix were
resumed. Later on postoperative day one, he was transferred to
the step down unit for further recovery. He was gently diuresed
towards his preoperative weight. The physical therapy service
was consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and
mobility. He developed atrial fibrillation which was treated
with amiodarone and an increase in his beta blockade. He was
transfused with packed red blood cells for postoperative anemia.
Coumadin was started for anticoagulation for atrial
fibrillation. Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed abdominal distention with
some nausea and vomiting. An NG tube was placed for bowel rest.
An abdominal x-ray showed an adynamic ileus. Laxatives were used
in addition to a suppository. Ileus improved and NGT was
removed. He tolerated a regular diet, and he was ready for
discharge to rehab on POD #8.
