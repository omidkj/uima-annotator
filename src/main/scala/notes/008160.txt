History of Present Illness:
67 year old man with CAD s/p MI, systolic CHF LVEF 25% with
AICD, DM2, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p femoral endarterectomy, afib of
warfarin, hypothyroidism, s/p ileostomy for cecal volvulus, who
presented to OSH after developing afib with RVR during a
hemodialysis session. He received amiodarone followed by
synchronized cardioversion but subsequently became hypotensive
(SBP 60s) and was transferred to [**Hospital6 17183**] on [**2129-6-8**].

At [**Hospital3 **] he was in sinus rhythm but persistently
hypotensive not responsive to IVF and thus norepinephrine was
started. His AICD was interrogated and was functioning
appropriately. He developed abdominal distention and vomitting
on [**2129-6-9**]. KUB suggested bladder pneumotosis. CT abd/pelvis
showed pneumotosis in and around the bladder wall with question
of a small bowel to bladder fistula. Foley was placed with
return of blood and pus. No UA or culture available. Blood
cultures grew GNR, not yet speciated. He was started on
Vancomycin and Zosyn. Vancomycin was switched to linezolid given
history of VRE urospesis in 2/[**2129**]. Labs notable for WBC 12.8
and INR 7.0 (reversed to 1.5 with vitamin K and FFP), BUN/Cr
39/3.2. He has 2 PIV 20G and an HD tunneled line that did not
appear infected per report.
Prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2129-6-10**], he was started on HD and
developed afib with RVR. He was given an amiodarone bolus and
switched to phenylephrine. He then was cardioverted with return
of HR to V-paced rhythm to HR 55.
Vitals prior to transfer: Afebrile, rapid afib 160s, BP 114/70
on norepinephrine, 94-95% 2L NC. Exam notable for a stage IV
coccyx ulcer. He has 2 PIV 20G.

On arrival to the MICU, he is lethargic but arousable to voice
and follows commands. He denies pain currently. He is too
lethargic to give a ROS.

Social History:

Cdiff NEgative

Blood cultures NGTD or negative

Imaging:
TTE:
IMPRESSION: Akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral segments
and severe hypokinesis of the septum (EF 15-20%). Dilated and
hypokinetic reight ventricle. Moderate to severe, posteriorly
directed mitral regurgitation.

R Foot Xray [**6-14**]:
IMPRESSION:
New lytic lesion in posterior calcaneus. If there is no
intervening
debridement to account for this, then this is consistent with
osteomyelitis of the posterior calcaneus.

CT Cystogram [**2129-6-17**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Extensive emphysematous cystitis as well as likely clot
within the bladder wall but no evidence of fistula connections
to the small bowel or bladder rupture.
2.  Resolution of the previously extensive bowel wall
pneumatosis.
3.  Small amount of pelvic and abdominal free fluid.


Brief Hospital Course:
ID: 67 year old man with CAD s/p MI, systolic CHF LVEF 25% with
AICD, DM2, ESRD on HD, PVD s/p femoral endarterectomy, afib of
warfarin, hypothyroidism, s/p ileostomy for cecal volvulus, who
presented to OSH after developing afib with RVR during a
hemodialysis session, found to have septic shock with GNR
bacteremia and bladder wall pyocystis with emphysematous
cystitis.
