Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
Progressive signs of dizziness, visual difficulties, unsteady
gait

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right-sided high frontal stereotactic biopsy, CT-guided target
point, definition and MRI-guided intraoperative imaging.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of colon
cancer, as well as testicular cancer, who presents with
progressive signs of dizziness, visual difficulties, unsteady
gait for approximately 12 months. He was worked up including an
MRI scan that showed a brainstem lesion. He was referred to the
brain tumor clinic for consideration of a biopsy.

The patient has been followed at the [**Hospital6 **] at [**Location 10050**]. He had been treated for a number of medical issues. He
was examined by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 66170**] whose physical exam reportedly
showed bilateral facial numbness and swaying, and a MRI of the
head was preformed. This demonstrated expansion of the
brainstem without significant contrast enhancement. The patient
was thus considered to have a brainstem glioma and started on
Decadron. The patient now presents for a surgical opinion. In
the office, the patient complains about dizziness, blurred
vision, double vision, occasional headaches, and unsteady gait.
He feels better with medications. He takes at baseline 2 Tylenol
a day. Has a history of arthritis in the lower back, otherwise,
he reports that the numbness in his hands has disappeared since
starting the Decadron. The patient has tapered his Decadron to a
dose of 2 mg p.o. b.i.d. The patient is otherwise feeling
himself stable. He was told that he had a left lazy eye at
baseline, but the patient is not quite sure about the symptoms.
He denies otherwise any extreme fatigue, weight loss or other
symptoms.

Pathology [**2132-12-31**]:
MIDDLE CEREBELLAR PEDUNCLE/PONS STEREOTACTIC BRAIN BIOPSY
(including intraoperative smear):
DIFFUSELY INFILTRATING FIBRILLARY ASTROCYTOMA. WHO ([**2126**]) grade
II out of IV.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
56 M with PMH sigmoid and testicular ca in [**2125**], HTN, COPD,
admitted for new diagnosis pontine glioma s/p posterior fossa
decompression and necrotizing pna.
.
# Pontine glioma:
56 year-old man initially seen and discussed in brain tumor
clinic. Patient taken to OR on [**12-31**] for brainstem lesion biopsy
under general anesthesia. Postoperatively stayed in the PACU 6
hours then transferred to floor. On postop day one patient
demonstrated difficulty of swallowing which he failed his speech
and swallow evaluation. Patient kept NPO, started IV fluids. On
[**2133-1-2**] patient taken back to OR for a suboccipital chiari
decompression. Patient tranferred to neuro ICU for hemodymanic
and neurologic monitoring. Due to postoperaive respiratory
secretion extubated on [**2133-1-4**] after bronchcospy.
.
Brain stem biopsy pathology result is significant for
infiltrative astrocytoma. Radiation oncology decided not to
perform radiation mapping and to hold off for another several
weeks before planning to start XRT, since patient has a slow
growing glioma, and XRT could exacerbate pna.  Patient known by
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**] will follow up with him as scheduled.  Patient was
transferred to Step-down unit on [**2132-1-7**].  His speech continued
to become more articulate and clear, and his mental status
continued to become more clear.  The patient stated that his
dizziness has improved.
.
# Necrotizing pneumonia:
Patient has a known pulmonary process that been followed in
[**Hospital 669**] [**Hospital **] hospital in MA. In house repeat CT of the chest
significant for left lower lobe, consolidative opacity, with
central area of necrosis, an air-fluid level, and
low-attenuation material. Additionally, there are several areas
within the right and left lungs peripherally, with patchy
opacity and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, concerning for multifocal
opacity. There is also a wedge-shaped opacity in the right lower
lung zone, some of which may represent atelectasis.There is a
3.3 x 2.6 cm nodule with multiple foci of calcification within
the left lower lobe. Attempt to obtain images from [**Hospital **] hospital
regarding pulmonary lesions for comparison, [**Name (NI) 653**] with
MEdical records to sent ua CD images. Medicine and
interventional pulmonary services recommended continue
antibiotics, and follow up with chest CT with and with out
contrast in 4 weeks in pulmonary clinic. In the mean time
[**Name (NI) 653**] with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] at the [**Hospital **] hospital regarding
tranfering him over to VA regarding his known pulmonary process,
and colon carcinoma for further work up which he was agreed with
the transfer.
