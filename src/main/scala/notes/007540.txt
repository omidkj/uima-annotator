Imaging:

CXR [**2126-11-1**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Prominent hila suggestive of pulmonary hypertension or
pulmonary
embolism.
2. No evidence for CHF. No other acute cardiopulmonary process.

CTA [**2126-11-1**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive bilateral pulmonary embolism. No definite evidence
for right
heart strain.
2. Trace pericardial effusion.
3. Mild prominence of the ascending aorta measuring 3.4 cm.

BL LENIs [**2126-11-1**]
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT of bilateral lower extremities.

TTE [**2126-11-2**]
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. There is mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40 %). The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. Apical function is preserved ([**Last Name (un) 13367**] sign).
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is borderline
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity dilation with free wall
hypokinesis. Mild global left ventricular hypokinesis c/w
diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.).

CXR [**2126-11-2**]
FINDINGS:

Compared to the prior study the right hilum remains prominent
and the study is
in a more lordotic position. While positioning differences could
contribute
to loss of visualization of some lower lobe branch pulmonary
vessels,
propagation of PE must be strongly considered. There are no new
focal
consolidations and the CP angles remain sharp.

CXR [**2126-11-4**]

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
unchanged right
mediastinal widening and increased diameter of the pulmonary
arteries.
Moderate cardiomegaly, no signs of overhydration, no pleural
effusion, no
parenchymal opacities.

ECG [**2126-11-3**]  11:27:52 AM

Sinus tachycardia
Low amplitude inferior T wave chnages are nonspecific and may be
within normal limits Since previous tracing of [**2126-11-2**], sinus
tachycardia rate faster, and T wave changes decreased

Brief Hospital Course:
60F with bilateral extensive pulmonary emboli.  Patient brought
to MICU for observation while on heparin gtt.  She remained
hemodynamically stable, although had evidence of heart strain on
EKG.  Her ACE was held.  She had LENIs that were negative and
ECHO suggestive of RV dilatation with positive [**Last Name (un) 13367**] sign.
 She remained in the ICU for 2 days for monitoring and her
tachycardia resolved. She was tranferred to the floor in stable
condition.

#) Pulmonary Emboli: Her PE was diagnosed in the emergency room,
and she was started on a heparin drip and transferred to the
MICU. Most likley from left leg, pt reported it had been swollen
and tender for weeks prior to presentation, also had taken 6 hr
bus ride a few weeks ago.   Clot may have propogated from
superficial veins into femoral. Her symptoms have improved
considerably since admission, though still has minimal activity.
 On the floor, she was continued on the heparin drip, and
started on Warfarin 5 mg po [**11-4**].  She was monitored on
telemetry and noted to have brief episodes of tachycardia.  She
did not required supplemental oxygen after transfer out of the
MICU.  On [**11-6**], her heparin drip was discontinued, and her son
had lovenox teaching.  She had an ambulatory O2 sat of 94-94% on
room air.  She was discharged home the next morning after her
second injection of lovenox with VNA services at home for blood
draws and daily injections.  Her PCP agreed to follow her INR.
.
#) Hypertension:  She was restarted home on her home lisinopril
2.5 on [**11-4**]
.
#) Hypothyroidism:  She was continued on home levothyroxine
throughout her stay.
.
#) Neck radiculopathy:  She was continued on home neurontin 300
mg qhs
