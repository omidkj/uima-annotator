Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain and shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placed on [**6-22**]. S/p intubation and extubation.

History of Present Illness:
72 M with CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on HD, HTN, DM. Pt awoke on the
morning of admission with CP, SOB, called EMS who found pt to be
in VT. Pt subsequently lost pulse, was given lidocaine 100mg
bolus, and was transferred to [**Location (un) 620**] ED. There he persisted in
VT, received amiodarone 300mg bolus, was started on amio drip,
intubated for airway protection, had 2 cardioversions, had
subsequent PEA, received epi, atropine, also received CaCl,
bicarb, D50, insulin, kayexalate for empiric tx of hyperkalemia.
Started on levophed for hypotension, and was transferred to CCU
for further care.
Notably pt recently hospitalized at [**Location (un) 620**] from [**5-16**] to [**5-19**]
with CP/SOB, ruled out for MI and discharged home. Notably no
dialysis during that hospitalization, planned for outpt
dialysis.
EKG showed baseline LBBB, s/p arrest EKG showing deep ST
depressions in V2-3 post code.
.
Access: Hickman right chest. [**Location (un) 620**] ED attempted a subclavian
on left but couldn't threat wire, L femoral line placed instead
(has hx right fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] graft).

Old EKG from [**2169-3-29**] similar with same T wave inversions,
slightly less pronounced ST depressions V4-V5.
TELEMETRY demonstrated: VT on rhythm strips from outside

.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**4-30**]: EF 55%. mildly dilated LA, moderate
symmetric LVH, mod. dilated LV. mild LV systolic dysfunction
with basal infero-lateral thinning and akinesis. mildly
thickened AV. no AS. 1+AR. MV mildly thickened. 1+MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 33904**]l effusion. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2167-2-24**], no definite change (prior study was of
poor quality to exclude above findings).
.
CARDIAC CATH [**3-1**]:
1. patent LIMA to LAD with no significant disease distal to the
[**Female First Name (un) 899**]. The SVG to PDA and SVG to OM were also widely patent. The
stent in the OM was widely patent and the 80% lesion in the
lower pole was unchanged.
2. The native coronary arteries were not injected due to known
severe
disease.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed an opening aortic
pressure of 114/61mmHg.

1. Severe native three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA and vein grafts, widely patent OM stent.

IMAGING:
CXR [**2169-6-22**]: Increased right lower lobe opacity, probably due to
pulmonary edema or infection. (Initially read as wedge-shaped
opacity).
TTE [**6-22**]: Severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
- EF = 20-25%. Mild AR. Moderate-to-severe MR. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-5-2**], LV systolic function
has markedly deteriorated and severity of MR has increased.
inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis was present on the prior
study.
CXR [**2169-6-23**]: More extensive left lower lobe opacity, probably
due to atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Bilateral effusions and persistent right lower lobe process,
suggesting edema versus infection.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 33905**] is a 72 yo M with history of CAD s/p CABG, ESRD on
HD who presented with VT/ PEA/ cardiac arrest with prolonged
resuscitation (CPR > 45min), intubated for airway protection,
whose course was complicated by anoxic brain injury. Hospital
course by problem:

1)Arrhythmia: The original rhythm (VT/ PEA/ cardiac arrest) was
unclear as EMS found pt down and shocked him right away. The
patient was treated with cardioversion, initially started on
lidocaine, then started on amiodarone to prevent further
episodes of VT. The patient briefly went into atrial
fibrillation (although he had no documented history of this in
the past), but remained in NSR throughout the remainder of his
hospital course, with only occasional APBs and PVCs on
telemetry. The etiology of original arrhythmia was most likely
scar-induced. Electrolyte abnormality was unlikely given stable
electrolytes at OSH. Ischemic etiology was unlikely given
cardiac enzymes not commensurate with that of MI.

2)Hemodynamics: Upon admission the pt was initially hypotensive.
BP was maintained with a levophed drip, which was slowly weaned
as tolerated. Follow-up echo on [**2169-6-22**] showed EF of 20-25% with
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, which had
markedly deteriorated. Volume management was maintained via
hemodialysis.

3) CAD w/3 vessel disease:The patient was maintained on ASA and
statin given his history of CAD.

4)Poor oxygenation: CXR findings on [**6-22**] (above) were initally
read as concerning for PE. But because PE could not be ruled out
(as contrast could not be administered through the pt's IV site
and the patient??????s family did not want to place a central line
with a larger lumen for this purpose), patient was started on a
heparin drip.  The patient remained intubated for airway
protection throughout his hospital stay. Ventilator settings
were weaned as tolerated to FiO2 of 50%.
