Asthma on Symbicort (not used in [**6-22**] months)and albuterol QID
(no ICU or intubation history)and significant smoking history
who presents to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with shortness of breath for past

.
She reports five day history of productive cough, 3-day history

CXR ([**2163-1-26**]):Complete right upper lobe collapse, with
perihilar convexity that may represent lymphadenopathy. However,
central obstructing mass cannot be excluded. Please correlate
clinically, and followup with serial radiographs or CT to rule
out underlying mass lesion.
.
CT Chest ([**2163-1-26**]): Right upper lobe collapse. No definite
obstructing mass seen, but short-term follow-up radiographs are
recommended to document resolution, and correlation with
bronchoscopy should be considered if clinically indicated,
particularly if the abnormality does not resolve.
.
MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2163-1-28**]):    No MRSA isolated.
Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final [**2163-1-26**]): Negative for
Respiratory Viral Antigen. Specimen screened for: Adeno,
Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, Influenza A, B, and RSV by
immunofluorescence.
.
IgE, glactomannan pending. Pt to follow-up with pulmonology.


Brief Hospital Course:
33 year old female with past medical history significant for
Asthma on Symbicort (not used in [**6-22**] months)and albuterol QID
(no ICU or intubation history) and significant smoking history
who presents to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with shortness of breath due to
viral infection induced asthma exacerbation. Her brief hospital
course is as follows:
.
#Asthma exacerbation: With history of cough and rhinorrhea for
few days with sick contact (mom) and no fever or pleuritic chest
pain, this episode likel represented a d viral bronchitis
leading to asthma exacerbation in setting of not using her
Symbicort for several months (6-8 weeks) and becoming toleratent
to her short acting albuterol. She was given solumedrol, stacked
nebs, magnesium and azithromycin in the ED. She was admitted to
the MICU where she had a peak flow of only 98 cc with FEV of
0.71 with decreased breath sound on LUL (RUL on CXR/CT).  An ABG
showed good pO2 on 2LNC and respiratory alkalosis. She was
continued on duo-nebs and started on 60mg of PO prednisone.
Viral studies were obtained which were negative. The patient
improved over night with the above treatments, such that a
bronchoscopy was not performed (was considered for possible
mucus plugging). She was transferred to the floor on the
following afternoon and her prednisone was stepped down to 40mg
PO. The following morning, she was significantly improved. She
had an ambulatory 02 sat of 98% on RA and she had a peak flow of
250cc. She was discharged on a 14 day steroid taper and her home
symbicort plus albuterol. She was also placed on calcium,
vitamin D and omeprazole to protect her from the side-effects of
the steroids. She will follow-up with pulmonology on [**2-9**], who
also ordered some labs for fungal testing, please see below. Her
vital signs and respiratory status was closely monitored during
this admission.
.
#RUL collapse and bronchial inflammation on CT Chest concerning
for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillusis: She was seen by
pulmonology in the ICU. It was determined that she would be
discharged on a two week steroid taper and follow-up with
pulmonology as the confirmatory labs are all send-outs. A
discussion was held with the patient and she states that she
understands the importance of following up with pulmonology and
of taking her controller medications. It is likely that she will
need inhaled steroids. She will follow-up with pulmonology.
.
#PCOS/Prediabetes: Her metformin was held in the context of her
CTA chest and a contrast load. She was covered with an insulin
sliding scale, particularly since she was on prednisone. Her
metformin was restarted upon discharge. She will follow-up with
her primary care doctor, with the recommendation for a fasting
blood sugar check as well.
.
#Prophylaxis: She received subcutanous heparin for DVT
prophylaxis, omeprazole for GI prophylaxis, and senna and
docusate for her bowels.
.
At the time of discharge she was tolerating a regular diet, her
pain was controlled, her respiratory status was stable and vital
signs were within normal limits. She will follow-up with her
primary care doctor and pulmonology.
