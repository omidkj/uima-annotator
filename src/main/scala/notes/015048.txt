CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Cannot breathe.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 48-year old female with a
history of unclear neurological syndrome and diabetes
presented to at an outside hospital in [**State 792**]with
blood sugars of over 500 and was transferred over to the [**Hospital3 **] Medical Center for further management.

However, during the transfer in the ambulance she had an episode
of difficulty breathing.  The patient reported that this was her
"laryngospasm".  According to the notes by the EMT, she was
squeaking when inspiring but not expiring.  Also complained
of epigastric pain and lower back pain.  Her oxygen
saturation during this time was 99-100% on room air and
throughout the hospitalization as well.  She was given
methylprednisolone, Benadryl, Ativan with minimal resolution
of the difficulty breathing.  Thereafter, she was given
racemic epinephrine and lidocaine.  She was admitted to the
intensive care unit for further management.

The patient reports she has such symptoms in association with her
stiff- man syndrome; and 1 to 2 times a week for the last year
has had extensive workup with her ENT specialist at the
[**State 51252**],  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], as well as
with a neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 557**] here at the [**Hospital1 346**] over the past year and more.  She
had a recent admission at an outside hospital for GI bleeding
a month back, and reports a normal endoscopy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Type 2 diabetes, stiff-man syndrome
for 3 years, questionable history of vocal cord spasm (refer
to the brief hospital summary for details), GERD, DVT (on
Coumadin), asthma, trigeminal neuralgia, mitral valve
prolapse, thoracic outlet syndrome, status post carpal tunnel
surgery bilaterally, migraines, with a history of status
migrainosus, status post appendectomy, history of cesarean
section, history of a lumpectomy of the breast.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Neurontin 400 mg b.i.d., Valium 2.5 mg
t.i.d., Lantus 20 units at bedtime, Lipitor 10 mg daily,
Prilosec 40 mg daily, baclofen 10 mg t.i.d., atenolol 25 mg
daily, metformin 500 mg b.i.d., Diovan 80 mg daily, Cymbalta
50 mg daily, Coumadin 2.5 mg daily, Asacol 800 mg t.i.d..

ALLERGIES:  IODINE, COMPAZINE and BACTRIM.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with her husband in [**Name (NI) **].
Denies smoking, alcohol or illicit drug use.  Formerly worked
as an EMT.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No known family history of stroke,
neuromuscular disease.  Has a family history of epilepsy
among her paternal grandmother and a paternal cousin.  [**Name (NI) **]
mother has a thyroid problem, and has an uncle with [**Name (NI) **]
disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.2, blood pressure 144/72, pulse
58, respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 96% on room air.
When in laryngospasm, the patient has a flat affect, closes
her eyes tight, and appears disinterested, and not responding
to verbal commands.  HEAD AND NECK EXAM:  Oral examination;
no erythema, thrush or exudates.  Moist mucous membranes.
JVD not elevated.  No cervical or supraclavicular
lymphadenopathy.  No stridor.  LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Good air entry.  HEART EXAMINATION:  Normal.
ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, no palpable organs, but is obese.
EXTREMITIES: No edema.  Good pulses throughout.  SKIN:  No
rashes or lesions.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA, X-RAY, ELECTROCARDIOGRAMS AND
OTHER TESTS:  On admission, had a white count of 16,
hematocrit 34; which remained stable throughout the
hospitalization.  White count at discharge was 14.7.  INR
3.0; at discharge was 1.2.  Blood sugar on admission was 408.
Cardiac enzymes normal.  LFTs and lipase normal.  Normal
calcium, phosphate and magnesium levels.  Ferritin of 10,
normal B12 and folic acid levels.  Cortisol stimulation test
revealed a baseline cortisol before the cosyntropin panel
1.7, and after cosyntropin level of 8.1.  ABG during one of
the episodes of shortness of breath showed pH 7.4, pCO2 47,
pO2 131 on room air.  During one episode the pCO2 was up to
57, however, soon thereafter another ABG repeated showed a
pCO2 of 44 with a pO2 over 100.  Chest x-ray was
unremarkable.

BRIEF HOSPITAL SUMMARY:
1.  HYPERGLYCEMIA, DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2 POORLY CONTROLLED
    WITHOUT COMPLICATIONS:  The patient has reportedly gotten
    steroids on multiple occasions when she was at different
    emergency rooms at hospitals for episodes of difficulty
    breathing.  This could possibly be the reason why her
    sugars were so high during the initial admission.  During
    the hospitalization, after initial management with an
    insulin drip, she was transitioned over to subcutaneous
    insulin.  The dose of Glargine was increased to 25 units
    prior to dinner with a sliding scale.  The patient has
    regular followup with her [**Last Name (un) **] provider, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 14116**].  She
is advised to follow up with her [**Last Name (un) **] provider within the week
of discharge for further management of her blood sugars.  By the
time of her discharge, her sugars were well controlled with most
of them being less than 150.
2.  DIFFICULTY BREATHING:  The patient has a long history of
    an unclear neurological illness that has occasionally
    been labeled as stiff-man syndrome or stiff-person
    syndrome.  On discussing with her neurologist, Dr.
    [**Last Name (STitle) 557**] at the [**Hospital1 69**] who
    has done an extensive workup for her as well as has known
    her for a long period time, reported that a large
    component of her symptoms is possibly functional.  The
    patient has had an extensive workup including an MRI of
    the head, EMGs, EEGs; all of which have been normal.  She
    is also followed up very closely by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the
    [**State 51252**], who treats her for
    voice therapy.  Upon discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who is
    a fellow with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] over the telephone, he stated
    that during one of the episodes of laryngospasm in the
    past a laryngoscopy was done that showed appropriate
    motion of the vocal cords without any paralysis or tumor.
    She also had a laryngoscopy done recently at the [**Hospital1 35990**] by the ENT physicians in
    clinic that was unremarkable except for some evidence of
    reflux.  During this hospitalization in the intensive
    care unit as well as on the floor, the patient had
    multiple episodes where she stated she had trouble
    swallowing.  It was noted during these episodes that she
    was squeaking and making a noise that was unlike stridor
    in the true sense.  Despite these episodes lasting for
    over half an hour, there was no cyanosis or hypoxia
    noted.  Oxygen saturation throughout the entire episode
    was over 95% on room air.  The patient did not respond to
    albuterol or steroids during any of these episodes.  A
    large component of anxiety and panic were noted during
    these episodes for her.  No seizure activity was noted.
    Upon reassurance, the patient would slowly wake up and
    get back to normal.  Upon discussion with the husband as
    well, the patient has had multiple episodes like these in
    the past year; and he is aware of the need for close
    followup with her primary care as well as specialist
    providers.  Given the possible functional component with
    these episodes, psychiatry was consulted.  However, after
    initial evaluation the patient refused to follow up with
    the psychiatrist inpatient despite an extensive
    discussion with her about the need for such consultation.
    It is recommended to her at discharge as well as to her
    husband that she would benefit from outpatient
    psychiatric care.  Psychiatry did not think that the
    patient was at harm to herself or to others and did not
    expose any dangerousness to self or others to warrant
    involuntary inpatient management. The psychiatry was of
    th
