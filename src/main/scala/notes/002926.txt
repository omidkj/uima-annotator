Attending:[**Male First Name (un) 5282**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute renal failure and liver transplant evaluation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Paracentesis
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
Hysteroscopy and polypectomy


History of Present Illness:
 Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 51 year old lady with history of ESLD
secondary to HCV/EtOH (?) cirrhosis (c/b ascites,
encephelopathy, and jaundice, variceal status unknown), HIV
(recent VL undectectable per pt, off of HAART), diabetes
mellitus, and hypertension who presents for liver transplant
evaluation.

Ms. [**Known lastname **] is seen by a hepatologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Location (un) 6691**],
MA who referred her to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] for transplant evaluation.
Patient was seen in clinic and admitted for blood work and
therapeutic paracentesis. She reports that she was diagnosed
with HCV in [**2165**] and her course has become more complicated in
the past year, with ascites, yellowed eyes, and episodes of
"memory loss" that improve with lactulose. She has had multiple
paracenteses in the past year- her last one was about two weeks
ago, when she reports they removed about 6 liters. She denies a
history of varices, but reports she has never had an EGD or
colonoscopy.

Patient reports she is currently with some abdominal and lower
back discomfort secondary to her ascites, but denies focal
abdominal pain. Reports she feels cold, but denies objective
fevers. Denies nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, black tarry
stools, and BRBPR, but reports occasional hemorrhoidal bleeds.

On ROS, she does report some SOB associated with her increasing
abdominal girth, which has also limited her ability to walk
around. Also notes loose stools with her lactulose. Some itchy
bumps on arms and chest in the past week, which she has been
scratching. + vaginal bleeding attributed to recent d/c of
tamoxifen; + hemorrhoids. Denies CP, palpitations, productive
cough, headaches, visual changes, myalgias, arthralgias, and
dysuria.

HCV- diagnosed in [**2165**]
HIV- diagnosed in [**2152**]; off of HAART; VL undectable 2 months ago
per patient
Diabetes mellitus on insulin
Hypertension
Breast cancer s/p lumpectomy, radiation and tamoxifen in [**2167**]
Hyperlipidemia

Social History:
Lives in [**Location 6691**], MA with her daughter and daughter's
boyfriend and three grandchildren. Has two sons, one in North
[**Name (NI) **], and the other one "locked up." Currently on
disability, but was previously employed in maintenance and food
services at [**Last Name (un) 6058**]. Quit smoking in [**2167**], smoked 2-2.5 packs
for 30+ years. History of heavy alcohol use in past- 6 pack +
bottle of wine in past, but has been sober since [**2164**]. Remote

Studies:
[**9-10**] TTEcho: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**9-10**] Abd U/S w/ Doppler: 1. Nodular hepatic architecture with no
focal liver lesion identified. 2. Patent portal vein, however, a
small nonocclusive thrombus is seen within the left portal vein.
3. Large amount of ascites. A mark was made at the right lower
quadrant for a paracentesis to be performed by the clinical
staff.
.
[**9-14**] EGD: Grade I varices.
.
[**9-17**] CXR: In comparison with the study of [**9-15**], there is no
evidence of focal pneumonia. There are continued low lung
volumes. Dobbhoff tube extends at least to the second portion of
the duodenum. There is, however, an area of opacification in the
right upper zone medially that appears to be contiguous with the
medial aspect of the clavicle and could well represent an
expansile lesion. For further evaluation, views of the
clavicle and sternoclavicular joints are recommended. If this
proves to be a skeletal finding, cross-sectional imaging would
be helpful.
.
[**9-17**] Rt Clavicle XR: No expansile lesion identified. There are
mild degenerative changes of the sternoclavicular joint. If
there is pain r
