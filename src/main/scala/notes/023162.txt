History of Present Illness:
This 81 year old woman has a history of hypertension and a prior

CVA that was diagnosed in [**2109**] when she presented to an outside

hospital with symptoms of dysarthria and confusion. She was
subsequently started on Coumadin and around the same time
diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and a PFO on echo imaging.
Since that time she has not had any additional neurologic
symptoms.
.
Over the years she has had serial echocardiograms, the most
recent in [**2113-10-2**]. Further review of this testing has

been notable for a progressive increase in pulmonary artery
pressures from 30mm HG to about 60 mmHG on her most recent echo,

with significant mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.
.
Because of these findings, she was referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 122**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] regarding evaluation and further treatment of the PFO.

Notes from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] mention that upon review of her echo, it

appeared that her ??????PFO?????? was more likely an ASD. Plans are for
diagnostic cardiac catheterization to assess the significance of

the ASD as relates to her pulmonary hypertension. Based upon
these results, the patient will be given recommendations
regarding best treatment options.

[**2113-12-11**] - Cardiac Catheterization
1.  Selective angiography of this right dominant system single
vessel
coronary artery disease.  The left main demonstrated no
angiographically
apparent flow limiting lesions.  The left anterior descending
artery
demonstrated a mid-distal focal 60% lesion with excellent flow
distal to
the lesion.  The left circumflex demonstrated only mild luminal
irregularities.  The right coronary artery demonstrated a 30%
proximal
lesion.
2.  Lv ventriculography demonstrated a preserved left
ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 50%. The
anterolateral
wall demonstrated mild hypokinesis.  The LV gram demonstrated a
calcified mitral valve with 3+ regurgitation.
3.  Hemodynamic evaluation demonstrated elevated right (RVEDP =
18 mm
Hg) and left heart (LVEDP = 23mm Hg) filling pressures.  There
was no
significant pressure gradient across the aortic valve upon
pullback from
the left ventricle to the aorta.  There was moderate pulmonary
artery
hypertension (48/30 mm Hg; mean 38 mm Hg). There was moderate
central
hypertension (148/97 mm Hg).
4.  Following a bolus of IV heparin, the PFO was engaged and
crossed
into the left atrium.  A sizing balloon was inflated and
occluded the
PFO with continuous monitoring of the pulmonary artery pressure.
 No
significant change in the pulmonary artery pressure was noted
Resting
oximetry was 92% and improved to 100% with the administration of
oxygen
ruling out a significant right to left shunt.

[**2113-12-18**] ECHO
PREBYPASS
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. A patent foramen ovale is present with a
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are three aortic valve leaflets. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.
8. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results on [**2113-12-18**]
at 1250.

POSTBYPASS
1. Pt is on epinephrine infusion
2. A well seated, well functioning bioprostetic valve is seen in
the mitral position. No leaks are seen
3. A well seated, well functioning annuloplasty ring is seen
around the tricuspid valve.
4. No color flow is seen across the intraatrial septum
5. The left atrial appendage has been ligated.
6. LV wall motion is similar.

[**2113-12-12**] - Carotid Ultrasound
Bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 80375**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2113-12-11**] for a cardiac
catheterization. This revealed severe mitral regurgitation, a
patent foramen ovale and single vessel cornary artery disease.
An echo was obtained which again showed severe mitral
regurgitation but also showed severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Given the severity of her disease, the cardiac surgical service
was consulted for surgical management.Ms. [**Known lastname 80375**] was worked-up
in the usual preoperative manner including a carootid duplex
ultrasound which showed [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 40% bilateral internal carotid
artery stenosis. The oral surgery service was consulted for oral
clearance for valve surgery. It was found that she needed a
tooth extracted prior to having her valve surgery which was
performed on [**2113-12-15**]. Please see separate dictated operative
note for details. She was then cleared for surgery. On [**2113-12-18**],
Ms. [**Known lastname 80375**] was taken to the operating room where she underwent
a mitral valve replacement, a tricuspind valve repair, a patent
foramen ovale closure and ligation of a left atrial appendage.
