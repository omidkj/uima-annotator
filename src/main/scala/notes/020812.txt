Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**]
Chief Complaint:
confusion and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right internal jugular line placement and removal


History of Present Illness:
57 M with Hepatitis C cirrhosis, polysubstance abuse, history of
noncompliance with appointments, presented today with confusion
concerning for encephalopathy, with development of hypotension
in ED this evening.  Patient unable to give accurate history due
to encephalopathy.  Wife reports recent admission to OSH for
which he was discharged around [**10-8**].  Recent hospitalization
for encephalopathy and worsening edema; diuretics were
uptitrated; also treated for apparent pneumonia with
levofloxacin - reportedly negative tap for SBP (also done for
therapeutic purposes).  Wife notes that abdominal and leg
swelling have worsened since discharge.  Also complained of
chills without documented fever, mild cough, and no bowel
movements x 3 days despite regular lactulose.
.
IN the ED, noted to have leukocytosis to 12.4K with 80%
neutrophils; also creatinine 1.6 (unknown baseline),
hyponatremia to 126.  Sent for ultrasound and chest Xray; upon
return from studies was found to have BP 74/39 with pulse 59,
dropped as low as 67/43.  RIJ placed and levophed gtt initiated
(received 1L+ NS).  Vanco and eventually aztreonam given (PCN
allergy).  NGT placed and ?lactulose given.  Upon arrival to
floor, NGT out.


Past Medical History:

decompensation in the past with ascites requiring therapeutic

TTE ([**10-13**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. No discrete vegetation seen (does not
exclude). There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with
hyperdynamic systolic function. Minimal aortic valve stenosis.

Liver ultrasound ([**10-12**]): Small amount of ascites in the right
upper quadrant. The main portal vein is patent with antegrade
flow.


Brief Hospital Course:
57 yo male with pmh of Hep C cirrhosis admitted for hepatic
encephalopathy and hypotension now with resolved encephalopathy
and stable pressures.

# Previous episode of hypotension: Patient initally had a
leukocytosis, hypothermia, and hypotension which was concerning
for spesis, however none of his blood cultures have been
positive.  He had no evidence of GIB initially. His hematocrit
followed as detailed below.  He may also have been dry from
overdiuresis given recent increase in his diuretic dosing. He
was unable to have a diagnostic para due to the small amount of
ascites present. He was empirically treated for SBP with
ceftriaxone. His urine, blood, c.diff, CXR were negative.  He
was ultrasounded on multiple occasions but repeatedly with not
enough fluid to safely tap for SBP evaluation.  He required
vasopresssors for a little over 24 hours and was then able to be
weaned.  Regarding antibiotics, he was initially placed on
vancomycin, aztreonam, and flagyl.  With above negative workup,
he was changed to ceftriaxone for SBP.  Also received 2 large
doses (1.5 mg/kg on day 1 and 1 mg/kg on day 3) of albumin given
presumed SBP.  Stress dose steroids for 2 days given recent
prednisone course.  He completed a 7 day course of ceftriaxone
and was discharged on 250 mg of ciprofloxacin daily for SBP ppx.


# Anemia: The patient's Hct dropped on hospital day 2 by 10
points in setting of aggressive hydration (his baseline is in
the 30s). His stools were trace guaiac positive. His Hct drop
was likely dilutional in addition to small amounts of bleeding
in the setting of hepatic coaglatopathy (trace guiaic positive
stools, epistaxis, phlebotomy).  He had a low haptoglobin and
rising T. bili concerning for hemolysis; however these tests are
difficult to interpret in liver patients and his Hct remained
stable after the inital drop.  On discharge his Hct was 27.2.

# Positive UA/UCx: The patient had a positive UA on [**10-15**] (when
he was on ceftriaxone).  No antibiotics were adde
