Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 495**]
Chief Complaint:
Asystolic arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IJ CVL placement


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **]yo M s/p asystolic arrest who presents from OSH
fro therapeutic hypothermia post cardiac arrest.

[**Name (NI) **] son reports that in the days prior to admission, he
was having more 'cold' (a productive cough). [**Name (NI) **] son also
reports vomiting and difficulty maintaining PO intake. Patient
was on Levaquinn for treatment of UTI; he completed a coure
approximately 2 days ago.

Per report the patient was last noted to have received a cup of
something to drink from a home health-aid and then went to bed.
Reportedly, 30 minutes later, the patient was found in his bed
unresponsive. His family began chest compressions and EMS was
called. He received epinephrine times 3 in the field and was
intubated. He was then transferred to [**Hospital3 **]. At [**Hospital1 **], he was started on Levophed. Upon starting Levophed,
the patient's SBP at OSH was noted to be in the 140s. He was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for therapeutic hypothermia post
cardiac arrest.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the patient was noted to be breathing over the
vent. He was given Fentanyl and midazolam boluses. A bedside
ECHO in the ED showed an EF of approximately 10%. Exam was
notable for a lack of corneal reflexes as well as a gag.  Pupils
were noted to be fixed and dialted.  Post-arrest team was
consulted in the ED. CXR in the ED was notable for right LL
opacity concerning for aspiration PNA. An A-line was placed in
the ED. For access: PIV in EJ, R femoral line, and Left IO.
Patient had a head CT that showed no evidence of acute bleed.
Levophed was able to be weaned to 0.03mcg/mg/min and dopamine
was started. The patient maintained MAPs in the 60s on the
combination of dopamine and Levophed.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient is intubated. He is on
Levophed 0.1mcg/kg/min.

   Blood Culture, Routine (Preliminary):
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.
         Consultations with ID are recommended for all blood
cultures

TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. The interatrial septum
is bowed towards the left atrium c/w increased RA pressure.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis. Quantitative (biplane) LVEF = 18 %. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular volume overload. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. The study is inadequate to
exclude significant aortic valve stenosis, but severe stenosis
is not suggested. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy and right ventricular cavity enlargement with global
biventricular hypokinesis. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.

NCHCT: 1.  No acute hemorrhage or mass effect. White matter
hypodense areas.
Subtle/equivocal loss of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation
is compatible
with known history of prolonged cardiac arrest. Consider MRI if
not CI if
clinically indicated for better assessment of infarction.
2.  Moderate paranasal sinus disease.

EEG: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study because
of
burst suppression pattern. The bursts consist of [**12-16**].5 Hz high
amplitude
delta with superimposed [**4-20**] Hz theta activity lasting one to two
seconds and
the interburst interval varies from 10 seconds to several
minutes. In the
last few hours of the study, the bursts becom
