Chief Complaint:
transfer from [**Hospital1 **] for cardiac cath with intervention of
Left Cx

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with stent placement [**2141-3-29**]

History of Present Illness:
73 yo M with significant CAD s/p CABG [**2104**] with redo in [**2134**],
DM, high grade AV block s/p DDD pacer, and HTN presented
initially to [**Hospital1 **] with increasing SOB and angina with
minimal activity worsening x3 weeks requiring increasing amounts
of SL NGT. Initial cardiac enzymes negative. Pt underwent cath
on [**2141-3-28**] through left femoral artery which revealed 95%
ungrafted OM1 lesion, occluded left sided vein grafts, patent
LIMA->LAD, and patent left radial to RCA. LV function severely
depressed.
.
Post cath he developed acute shortness of breath thought to be
secondary to pulmonary edema. He was positive ~700 cc since
admission on [**3-28**]. His BP was elevated at 170/110 with a HR of
130. He received several doses of IV lasix with minimal urine
output. ABG revealed 7.09/77/108 on 100% NRB. He was intubated
emergently around 4AM. His creat increased from 1.0 to 1.4 post
cath. He noted chills with an elevated WBC count of 17.9 with 5%
bandemia. CXR revealed b/l pleural effusions, pulm edema, and
probably LUL infiltrate. He was given a dose of levofloxacin and
Vanco. Blood cultures were drawn. He received ativan 5 mg IV x1
and then started on a ativan gtt at 1 mg/hr prior to transfer.
He received IV morphine and 8 Units of Regular insulin for a FS
328.
.
Upon arrival to the CCU he was intubated and sedated. He was
moving all extremities. He was minimally responsive to verbal
stimuli.

.
CXR [**2141-3-29**]: An endotracheal tube is positioned 2.5 cm above the
carina. A nasogastric tube descends below the diaphragm and is
coiled, and possibly kinked in the stomach fundus. The cardiac
silhouette is diffusely enlarged. There is severe bilateral
pulmonary edema, with moderately large pleural effusions, right
greater than left. Retrocardiac opacification is likely related
to volume loss.
.
ECG at [**Hospital1 **]: V-paced, rate 64, left axis
.
Cardiac cath [**2141-3-29**]: Patient intubated on arrival to cathlab.
Unable to access Right groin (occluded SFA). Initial angiography
revealed 90% lesion in OM branch. We planned to directly stent
this lesion.Heparin and Integrilin was commenced
prophylactically. A 6F XB 3.0 guide engaged the LCA and provided
adequate support. The lesion was crossed with a Prowater wire
resulting in no flow down vessel (indicating severe stenotic
lesion). The lesion was then stented the a Driver 3.0x12mm bare
metal stent deployed to 14atm. Good result with normal flow down
vessel. Patient's blood pressure dropped to 60 systolic at end
of procedure but rose to 150 systolic with easing of propofol
sedation.
.

ECHO [**2141-4-1**]: LVEF <20%, 1+ MR, severe pulmonary artery systolic
HTN


Brief Hospital Course:
This 73 year old man was admitted with acute pulmonary edema and
rising cardiac enzymes. He was taken urgently to the cardiac
cath lab where he was found to have 95% stenosis of OM1 and had
a bare metal stent placed with good effect. He was able to be
easily extubated. He was maintained on aspirin, plavix, statin,
metoprolol and lisinopril. He had a TTE to assess valves and
global systolic function which showed only global systolic
depression with estimated EF >20%, consistent with previous
ECHOs and 1+ MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was discharged to follow-up with his
cardiologist in [**Location (un) 47**] to futher consider difibrilator
placement or anticoagulation for his low EF.
