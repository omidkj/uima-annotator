Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4223**] is a 46 year old man with alchohol abuse and
anxiety originally admitted to MICU for alcohol withdrawal and
subsequently transferred back to the floor.
.
# ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL: On original admission to the floor, the
patient was requiring large doses of valium and was admitted to
the ICU management of alcohol withdrawal. In the ICU, the
patient was noted to be very anxious, but with few objective
signs of withdrawal. There, he initially required large doses of
valium and then was placed on the following taper outlined by
Psychiatry:
- Valium 20mg po q3h standing [**6-1**]
- Valium 15mg po q3h standing [**6-2**]
- Valium 10mg po q3h standing [**6-3**]
- Valium 5mg po q3h standing [**6-4**]
- The patient was monitored closely and did not require any PRN
benzodiazepines while on the valium taper. He was discharged to
home for follow up with a sobriety program. While hospitalized,
he spent a significant portion of time talking with our social
worker, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 636**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 12471**], to help arrange appropriate follow up for
alcohol abuse treatment.
- We continued the patient's thiamine, folate, and multivitamin.

- He was NOT discharged with any benzodiazepines.
.
# Anxiety: There appeared to be a large component of anxiety
prompting treatment of positive CIWA scale values while in the
ICU. This did not occur on the floor. At the recommendation of
Psychiatry, the patient was treated with zyprexa [**Hospital1 **] prn; he was
discharged home with a two-week supply of zyprexa with
instructions to follow up with his primary care doctor for
further management of anxiety.
.
# HTN: The patient has hypertension at baseline, and prior to
admission, he was being treated with clonidine, lisinopril, and
carvedilol. He was initially hypertensive due to withdrawal. We
placed the patient on his home lisinopril as well as HCTZ. We
discontinued his carvedilol given his cocaine use.
- BPs were well controlled at discharge.
- He was restarted on digoxin at discharge.
- Of note, the patient had bottles of pills with him which were
last filled in [**2102-2-2**]. These pill bottles (digoxin,
clonidine, carvedilol) were [**2-4**] full.
.
# H/O Etoh dilated CHF: Currently stable and euvolemic.
Continued digoxin as above. Discontinued carvedilol due to
cocaine use.
.
# Hypothyroidism: We continued his levothyroxine.
.
# FEN: He tolerated a low sodium cardiac diet. Repleted lytes as
necessary.
.
# PPX: The patient was ambulatory, tolerating a regular diet on
the floor. He used nicotine patches for tobacco abuse.
.
# CODE: full
.
# Patient was instructed to follow up with sobriety program.
