Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
paroxysmal Afib presenting for elective PVI;
pericardial effusion following PVI complicated by [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 11368**]


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
attempted PVI
pericardiocentesis w/ drain placement

History of Present Illness:
71YOM with history of severe COPD, HTN, 4 years of paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia and right-sided cardiac
hypertrophy presented for elective PVI that was performed under
TEE guidance and intracardiac echo. The procedure was
complicated by a perforation of his left atrium and a subsequent
pericardial tamponade resulting in an episode of hypotension in
his 40ies/50ies. Emergency pericardiocentesis yielded 500cc of
blood, also causing injury to his right ventricle. A drainage
was placed, the patient was intubated, heparin was stopped and
protamine was given. Two repeat ECHOs showed no signs of
reaccumulation of effusion, INR was 3.4, Hct had fallen from 46
on admission to 35. Patient was subsequently transfered to CCU
with pressure in his 110s.
.
Here patient arrived still intubated and presented with another
episode of hypotension in his 70ies. BP responded to a bolus of
fluids and a follow-up ECHO confirmed that no fluids had
reaccumulated. Next, muscle relaxants were antagonized and the
patient was extubated. He was kept anticoagulated with coumadin.
.
With regard to history of pAF (as per chart) the patient is
intolerant of or has failed all antiarrhythmics per Dr.[**Name (NI) 33490**]
note of [**2171-2-18**]. Patient denies ever having a cardioversion.
Patient was in sinus rhythm during his last office visit with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and felt well. An echo on [**2081-2-7**] showed a LVEF of
60-65%. The patient reports worsening symptoms during his
episodes of atrial fibrillation over the past one and a half
years.  His symptoms include feeling tired, non-radiating left
chest tightness, pounding in chest, and intermittent episodes of
shortness of breath sometimes occurring at rest. He sleeps on 3
pillows and occasionally wakes at night gasping and "looking for
air".  He does not use oxygen at home.  His
shortness of breath variably limits his activity. Some days he
is
able to walk his dog 1 mile.  Patient reports he is occasionally
aware of his atrial fibrillation.  He also describes episodes of
postural lightheadedness.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS (as per chart):
He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, claudication, deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for intermittend chest
pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and
palpitations.

[**5-1**] TTE:
FOCUSED STUDY: The right atrium is dilated. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is a large pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. No right ventricular diastolic collapse is
seen. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the
presence of elevated right sided pressures.

Post-pericardiocentesis: There is resolution of the pericardial
effusion.
.
[**5-2**] TTE:
The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. The
effusion appears circumferential. The effusion is echo dense,
consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-5-1**], the
current study is more complete. The findings are similar. A
small amount of pericardial fluid persists, particularly near
the right atrium. There is fluid seen also near the
inferolateral wall - this area was not visualized on the two
post-tap studies yesterday.

Brief Hospital Course:
71YOM with history of severe COPD, HTN and paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation presented for elective PVI that was complicated by
a perforation of his left atrium and a hemodynamically
significant pericardial tamponade s/p emergency
pericardiocentesis and drain placement.

# Pericardial tamponade: Following perforation of LA during PVI;
pericardiocentesis removed 500 cc of blood. Tamponade resolved
after pericardiocentesis in the cath lab. Pericardial drain was
left in overnight and was removed on [**5-2**] after drained only 100
cc's. Repeat Echo on [**2171-5-2**] confirmed there was no
reaccumulation of fluid and no tamponade physiology. BP was
stable ~ 90s-100s/40s. He received intermittent fentanyl for
pericarditis. He was called out to the cardiology floor on [**5-3**].


# Hallucinations: He was noted to have hallucinations on [**5-2**]
which he reports having had in the past.  He was restarted on
his home benzodiazepine and received intermittent Zyprexa for
agitation.

# Hypotension: Acute drop in blood pressure to 70's after
transfer to the floor.  Resolved with 1L IVF bolus and reduction
in propofol dose.  BP's were then measured in the 100's.  Likely
secondary to hypovolemia / dehydration and medication effect.

# COPD: History of severe COPD on Albuterol / Ipratropium
bromide nebs QID and Theophylline 200 mg 1 tbl [**Hospital1 **]. Bilater
