[**2110-1-11**] CT scan
1. Large hematoma in the left upper quadrant. Findings are
consistent with a large perisplenic hematoma, with extension
into the intraperitoneal cavity, with blood in the paracolic
gutters and around the liver. Additionally, there is a smaller
component within the left nephrectomy bed. Post-surgical changes
from recent surgery are again seen in the abdominal wall.
2. Cholelithiasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was stabilized hemodynamically and transferred to
the ICU.  The patient had an a-line and a central line placed
for hemodynamic monitoring.  However, after a few hours of
observation he was noted to become progressively more
hypotensive and requiring more blood. The decision was made to
take him to the operating room for an exploration.  The patient
underwent an exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy which he
tolerated well and was transferred to the ICU intubated and in
stable condition.  Because the patient had a splenectomy, he
received a Haemophilus, pneumococcal, and a meningococcal
vaccine.  The patient was able to be extubated on post-op day 1.
 The patient was started on a low dose furosemide drip to assist
with his diuresis and was transitioned over to intermittent
doses of furosemide.  He will continue to receive furosemide for
4 days after discharge.  Due to his foley catheter which had
been in place since his previous surgery, the patient developed
an E. coli urinary tract infection and was treated with Cipro
for this.  A CT cystogram was obtained on [**2110-1-16**] which showed
no bladder leak.
The patient's Hct remained stable for the duration of his
hospital stay and had a Hct of 26.7 on discharge.
During his admission, the patient had complaints of some mild
shortness of breath with rhonchorous breath sounds and
tachypnea.  He was give Albuterol/Ipratropium duonebs to which
he responded well to.  He had a CT angiogram to rule out PE.  On
discharge, the patient was oxygenating well on room air and was
not complaining of shortness of breath.  The patient's previous
symptoms were likely due to his COPD, atelectasis, and fluid
overload for which he was receiving Lasix.  Because he only has
one kidney, his Cr was monitored daily and was 1.1 on discharge.
The patient was able to tolerate a regular diet and was able to
ambulate with some assistance at discharge.
