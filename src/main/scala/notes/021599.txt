Chief Complaint:
hypoxia, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Placement of central lines
Thoracentesis
Tracheotomy

History of Present Illness:
65 yo male with DM, ESRD on HD 4x per week (T,TH,SAT,Sun), CHF
EF 35%, tachy/brady s/p PPM placement, Afib on coumadin, CVA w/
left-sided weakness, recent hospitalization with right shoulder
fx, norovirus infection, and pneumonia, who is admitted from an
outside hospital with hypoxia and hypotension

Pt was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] in mid [**Month (only) 1096**] after right humerus
fracture fx and went into rehabilitation facility. He was then
admitted to the ICU for hypotension and was treated empirically
for HCAP with cefepime and vancomycin for a total of 8 days
ending on [**2148-12-15**]. He was doing well by the time of discharge
and was sent to a [**Hospital1 1501**] in [**Location (un) 3844**]. As per wife he developed
[**Name (NI) 20198**] 3 weeks ago and then developed a pneumonia for which
he was treated with levofloxacin x 2 weeks. She states that he
had a cough with increased amounts of secreation and was not
improving on antibiotics. Yesterday his sats were down in the
80s% and he was transferred from his [**Hospital1 1501**] to an outside hospital.
He was also found to be hypotensive w/ SBP in 80s. His recent
sputum culture obtained at the [**Hospital1 1501**] grew MRSA. He was a given
Levofloxain and Moxifloxacin in the OHS and then transferred
here for further care.
.
In the ED his vitals were: 98.6, 92/59 on 2mcg of norepi, 70,
20, 96% on 5L. Pt had increase resp distress with increase in
RR, increase in lethargy. He was then intubated in the ED. His
CXR showed a left effusion and bilateral pulmonary air space
opacities. His troponin is elevated from his baseline at 0.18
and his EKG showed new RBBB while paced. As per ED report the
EKGs were sent to the Cardiology for opinion. He was also given
vanco and cefepime 2gm IV x I. He had L IJ placed and placement
confirmed. His labs are notable for WBC of 22.5, no bands.
Electrolyte abnormalities with elevated K of 5.2, however is due
to be dialyzed tomorrow. He also received 2 L of fluids.
.
On arrival to the MICU, pt is intubated and non-responsive. Exam
significant for cold extremities. Vitals: T 101, HR in 90s, BP
90s/40s, Sat 98% on vent- AC with VT 400, RR 20, PEEP 10. Foley
with dark urine. L IJ in place and pt receving levophed.

IMAGING:
[**2-21**] CXR: Bilateral pulmonary air space opacities concerning for
pneumonia.
Moderate left pleural effusion.
.
[**2-24**] CT Chest w/o con:
1. Bibasilar consolidations and multifocal ground-glass
opacities and
tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities concerning for multifocal pneumonia. The
density of the lung parenchyma at the lung bases alternatively
could be explained by
amiodarone toxicity. Upon resolution of the patient's presumed
pneumonia, a repeat chest CT should be performed to assess for
possible pulmonary effects of amiodarone.
2. Bilateral effusions.
3. Large main pulmonary artery, suggestive of pulmonary
hypertension.
.
[**2-24**] ECHO: The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dila
