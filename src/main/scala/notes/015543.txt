HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65 year old African
American woman with a history of diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and asthma who was
recently admitted to the [**Hospital6 256**]
from [**2189-12-25**] to [**2189-12-26**] with presyncope felt to be
posturally related.  She was ruled out for a myocardial
infarction on that admission, however, she had new T wave
inversions in L4 and L5.

She did well until [**2190-1-6**] when she was seen by her
Primary Care Physician who reported another episode of
lightheadedness that also seemed to be postural.  Her
Nifedipine was discontinued at the time and her
electrocardiogram was noted to be changed from one year prior
to being at the Primary Care Physician's office.

Her lightheadedness resolved but subsequently had asthma
exacerbations status post steroid course.  She also had an
episode of dyspepsia.

Elective echocardiogram today.  On the echocardiogram she was
shown to have a dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 40
percent.  Posterior/inferior/apical akinesis, lateral
hypokinesis and large thrombus in the left ventricle.  She
was transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**]
for further evaluation.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She has positive flushes deep in the
forehead.  Intermittent self limited episodes.  No focal
weakness.  No tingling.  No changes in vision.  No recent
headache.  No lightheadedness over the past several days.
However, she does remark that because she had been having
these lightheadedness, she had become noncompliant with her
medications since each thing she thought was making her
lightheaded, which may account for why she is having more
breathing difficulties since she stopped her puffers.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  She has diabetes mellitus which is
relatively well controlled off medications, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia and asthma.  Also, cholelithiasis and
lower back pain.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lipitor 10 mg q day.
2.  Nifedipine 60 mg q day which was discontinued on
[**2190-1-6**].
3.  Albuterol.
4.  Flovent 220 mcg two puffs b.i.d.
5.  Motrin.
6.  Zantac.
7.  Aspirin.
8.  Calcium.
9.  Multi-vitamin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a smoker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In terms of her physical exam, her
temperature is 96; pulse, 75; blood pressure, 126/72;
respiratory rate, 20; satting at 98 percent on room air;
weight is in 160s.  General, no apparent distress.  Speaking
in full sentences.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, pupils
are equal and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Dry mucous membranes.  Neck, carotids, 2+ pulses
bilaterally.  No appreciable bruits.  No elevations in
jugular venous distention.  Cardiovascular, regular rate and
rhythm.  S1, S2.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary,
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No wheezing.  Abdomen,
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Normal bowel sounds.  No
organomegaly.  Extremities, no edema.  No femoral bruits.
Palpable pedal pulses.  Neurological examination, she is
alert and oriented x 3.

LABORATORY EXAMINATION:  Laboratory examination on admission,
her chem 7 was generally unremarkable.  Her BUN, 15;
creatinine, 0.6.  Glucose, 211.  Her white count was 7.8.
Hematocrit, 39.9.  Platelets, 208.  Her CKs initially were 90
and a troponin of less than .3.  Her second set was 77 with a
troponin of less than .3.  Her INR was 1.0.

Her chest x-ray showed no evidence of focal consolidation,
flattened diaphragms and hyperinflation of the lungs
bilaterally.  Her head CT showed no definite evidence of
acute intracranial bleed.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 71 with normal axis
T waves inversions in V4 through V6.  ST flattening in the
limb leads.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**].  She is a 65 year
old woman with diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia and asthma with recent admission for
presyncope found to have a depressed systolic ejection
fraction on echocardiogram as well as a large left
ventricular thrombus.  In the setting of her recent
electrocardiogram changes and echocardiogram, the patient was
ruled out for an myocardial infarction with cardiac enzymes.

She was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory to
assess her reason for a fall in her left ventricular function
since she has never had chest pain and to risk stratify her
for coronary artery disease.

Her cardiac catheterization showed three vessel coronary
artery disease with an angiographically normal LMCA.  The
left anterior descending had 60 percent mid vessel stenosis,
mid to distal 90 percent diffuse stenosis involving the
origin of the major diag branch which also has a difficult 90
percent stenosis.  The left circumflex had a 70 percent mid
vessel lesion and a 90 percent distal lesion in the setting
of diffuse disease and the inferior branches a large OM1 had
diffuse 90 percent lesion.  The right coronary artery had
mild diffuse disease with a 60 percent mid vessel stenosis.
No other intervention was performed at the time since the
patient was thought to be more suitable for coronary artery
bypass graft.

The patient was evaluated by CT Surgery for a coronary artery
bypass graft.  Work up was performed to rule out any carotid
disease, however, during the process of the work up the
patient was found to have a severe right internal carotid
artery stenosis estimated to be 80 to 90 percent reduction in
luminal diameter.  On the left internal carotid, the luminal
narrowing was not exceeding 40 percent.

A follow up MRI/MRA of the head and neck were completed which
confirmed the right high grade stenosis of the right internal
carotid artery.  Also, there was an area of elevated T2
signal within the right occipital lobe.  The hyperintensity
also involved the cortex and subcortical white matter.  There
was also a 5 mm focus of elevated T2 signal within the right
periatrial white matter.  The findings were most consistent
with subacute or chronic infarcts.

The patient was taken to the Catheterization Laboratory again
to perform a right internal carotid artery stent by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **].  The patient subsequently went to the CCU
postoperatively but did not have any complication.

She was started on:
1.  Baby Aspirin.
2.  [**Name2 (NI) **].
3.  Coumadin.

Her goal INR should be between 2.5 and 3 as per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
for her left ventricular clot.  She is to continue [**First Name (STitle) **] for
a total of 30 days.  She is to continue her Baby Aspirin as
well.

CT Surgery wanted to wait four to six weeks before performing
coronary artery bypass graft on Mrs. [**Known lastname 100110**].  The patient will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**].

In terms of her next issue which is her hypertension, she was
started on a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor.

Next issue was Pulmonary.  She has asthma.  She was continued
on her inhalers and felt symptomatically better.

Endocrine.  Her diabetes mellitus and glucose was well
controlled, not needing much Insulin at all during her course
of hospitalization.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  She has large left ventricular clot.  She has three
vessel coronary artery disease.  She is status post cardiac
catheterization.  She had a right internal carotid artery
stenosis, status post right internal carotid artery stent.
2.  Type II diabetes mellitus, diet controlled.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Asthma.
6.  Cholelithiasis.
7.  Lower back pain.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  The patient's discharge medications
include:
1.  Aspirin 81 mg q day.
2.  Albuterol.
3.  Flovent.
4.  Zantac.
5.  Calcium.
6.  Multi-vitamin.
7.  Lipitor 10 mg q day.
8.  Atenolol 25 mg q day.
9.  Lisinopril 10 mg q day.
10. Zantac as perviously directed.
11. Coumadin 5 mg q day.

FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS:
1.  She is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2-12**] and to
have her INR checked in his office on [**2190-2-11**].
2.  She will have follow up with Dr.[**Name (NI) 3101**] office in one
month's time.
