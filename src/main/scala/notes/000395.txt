Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
left sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IV tPA before arrival at this hospital


History of Present Illness:
87 yo RHF with past medical history of AFib off coumadin for
past
week for colonoscopy, HTN,HL,AR, CHF p/w acute onset left sided
weakness at 3:15 p.m. She was in USOH till 3:00 p.m. today and
was seen by her son at 3:15 p.m. while eating to have acute
onset
weakness on the left side, noticed due to her food dribbling
down
on the left side of her face. EMS was called and she was taken
to
[**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] at 3:26 p.m. and was found to have dense left
hemiplegia, hemineglect and left visual field cut. Head CT
showed
a dense RMCA M1 thrombus extending up to M2. She received IV tPA
starting at 4:29 p.m. and received the full dose. She then
started complaining of mild right sided headcahe ([**12-2**]) which
persisted. She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for
possible neurointerventional procedure.

On neuro ROS, the pt denies headache, loss of vision, blurred
vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness,
vertigo, tinnitus or hearing difficulty. Denies difficulties
producing or comprehending speech.  Denies focal weakness,

11. Extinction and Neglect: 2

-Mental Status: Alert, oriented to name, month, and [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].
Drowsy, and dozes off when not being questioned. Speech is
fluent
in conversation. There were no paraphasias. Only able to report
"chair" and read the word "room" on stroke card, which are the
farmost right items, demonstrating dense neglect vs hemianopia.
Speech was not dysarthric. Able to follow both midline and
appendicular one-step commands. Dense visual, sensory, and
auditory neglect.

-Cranial Nerves:
I: Olfaction not tested.
II: PERRL 4 to 2mm and brisk. Does not BTT in left visual field
in either eye. Funduscopic exam deferred.
III, IV, VI: Forced gaze deviation to R that does not cross
midline. No nystagmus noted.
V: Facial sensation intact to light touch.
VII: Left facial paresis w NLF and inability to close L eye.
VIII: Hearing intact to finger-rub bilaterally.
IX, X: Palate elevates symmetrically.
[**Doctor First Name 81**]: 5/5 strength in trapezii and SCM bilaterally.
XII: Tongue protrudes in midline.

-Motor: Normal bulk, decreased tone on left. Moves LLE in plane
of bed but is unable to lift antigravity. Withdrawal response to
pain in LUE. Right sided extremities are antigravity.

-Sensory: Senses light touch reliably on right; sometimes when
left side is touched, she states she feels it on the right,
othertimes she does not feel it at all. Again sensory neglect is
profound.

-Coordination: No gross dysmetria when reaching out w right
hand.


-Gait: deferred.

CT/CTA/CTP
No acute intracranial hemorrhage.

2.  CT perfusion study suggests acute infarctions in the
superior right middle
cerebral artery territory and in the right posterior cerebral
artery
territory.  These are not yet detectible on the conventional CT
images, with
only a small focus of mild cytotoxic edema noted in the right
anterior insula.

3.  Large thrombus extending from the distal right common
carotid artery into
the proximal right internal carotid artery with 99% stenosis.
This thrombus
also extends into and completely occludes the proximal right
external carotid
artery, which demonstrates distal reconstitution, most likely
via retrograde
filling through its branches.

4.  Occlusion of the superior division of the right middle
cerebral artery.

5.  Bilateral fetal configuration of posterior cerebral
arteries.  The
posterior communicating arteries appear patent bilaterally.

6.  Enlarged and multinodular thyroid.  This may be further
evaluated by
[**Name (NI) 13416**], if not previously performed elsewhere.

MRI/MRA head and NEck
1.  Large acute infarctions involving the right frontal lobe,
insula, and
temporal lobe in the middle cerebral artery territory and the
right occipital lobe in the posterior cerebral artery territory.

2.  Focal hemorrhagic transformation in the posterior right
temporal lobe.

3.  Motion-limited MRAs of the head and neck demonstrate no
appreciable change
from the preceding CTAs of the head and neck.  There is a large
thrombus
extending from the distal right common carotid into the proximal
right
internal carotid and external carotid arteries, with 99%
stenosis of the right
internal carotid artery, better demonstrated on the CTA, and
complete
occlusion of the proximal external carotid artery (with
reconstitution via
retrograde filling).  Persistent occlusion of the superior
division of the
right middle cerebral artery.  Bilateral fetal posterior
cerebral arteries
with bilateral patent posterior communicating arteries.

Echocardiogram:
Patent ductus arteriosus. Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Pulmonary artery hypertension. Mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild
aortic regurgitation. Dilated ascending aorta.

CTA neck [**6-18**]:Interval decrease in size of the thrombus in the
right common carotid artery extending into both the internal and
external branches. A small amount of thrombus is still present.
2. The previously seen occlusion of the superior division of the
right MCA is not completely included in the field of view of
today's study give
