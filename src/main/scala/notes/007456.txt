History of Present Illness:
   79 y.o. male patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with a h/o CLL/AML
diagnosed in [**8-19**] and treated w/palliative allopurinol and
hydroxyurea w/ transfusion dependent pancytopenia (wbcc 3.4, 0
neutrophils on differential) who presents with a fever to 100.5.
For the past several days the patient has been feeling weak, w/
[**Month (only) **] appetite. He was seen in oncology clinic one day prior to
admission and received transfusion of one unit of platelets and
one unit of pRBC. Yesterday evening the pt noted that he had a
temperature to 100.5 at which point he contact[**Name (NI) **] the on call
oncologist who told him to go to the ED. States he has not had
prior f/c/n/v/abd pain/changes in bowel or bladder habits. No
new rashes. States he has had dry non-productive cough.
   In the ED, his bp was 92/39. He was given cefepime and 1L NS
with subsequent bp 78/32, hr 60, 96% 2L. After 2L NS bolus
89/33, hr 59 t98.4. Started on MUST protocol. RIJ placed, blood
(after abx?)and urine cultures obtained. Received total of 4L
NS. He was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. A CXR revealed a new RUL
infiltrate, and he was treated with vancomycin and cefipime, and
blood and urine cultures were done. He was stabilized for 1 day
and was transferred to the BMT floor.
.
Currently he is without complaints of pain, shortness of breath,
fevers, chills, nausea, diarrhea, urinary problems, cough, mouth
sores, or other problems. His last bowel movement was two days
ago.

CXR: RUL infiltrate

Echo [**2174-10-19**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of
[**2173-11-22**], tricuspid regurgitation is now more prominent and
estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is now higher.

CXR [**2174-11-2**]:
IMPRESSION:
Resolution of left lower lobe consolidation. Partial resolution
of right lower lobe consolidation. Persistent small bilateral
pleural effusions. Possible focal ill-defined density in the
right apical region.

CXR [**2174-10-20**]
FINDINGS: Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged. The
lung volumes remain low. Compared to the prior study, the region
of consolidation in the right mid-lung zone, which appears to
cross both the major and minor fissures, appears more confluent.
There are also bibasilar regions of consolidation, particularly
on the left, with small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no
pneumothorax. The prominence of the pulmonary vessels in the
upper zones is less pronounced on this study.
IMPRESSION: Persistent multilobar pneumonic consolidations, with
a more confluent and intense appearance in the right mid-lung
zone.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Pneumonia - The patient was hypotensive and febrile at
admission and therefore admitted to the ICU and put on the MUST
protocol but was never placed on pressors.  Although no initial
response. He soon had a stable blood pressure s/p 4L NS.  He had
no evidence of end organ hypoperfusion with a normal creatinine,
cv02, and normal cvp. He had a RML infiltrate and basal
infiltrates consistent with bacterial pneumonia. Blood cultures
were positive once for lactobacillus and sputum gram stain
showed 4+ gram negative rods, but no clear pathogen was
identified. He was put on vancomycin and cefepime, then agents
were added and subtracted over time to a maximal coverage of
vancomycin, cepepime, voriconazole for empiric fungal coverage
and flagyl for empiric anaerobe coverage. He continued to have
temperatures over 100.4 degrees and was functionally
neutropenic, but stopped being febrile on [**10-27**]. His coverage
was gradually reduced to levofloxacin alone and he was afebrile
during the remainder of the hospital course. A CXR showed
interval resolution in the pneumonia on [**2174-11-1**]. He was
discharged on levofloxacin x 14 days.

2) CLL/AML/Heme - The patient's peripheral blood had a mixed
appearance consistent with approximately half CLL and half AML
blasts. His overall WBC stayed under 4 during admission despite
holding his hydrea and allopurinol. He was neutropenic during
admission. He was known to be transfusion dependent and required
approximately 6 blood transfusions during admission and was
maintained on epogen. He required approximately 10 units of
platelets to keep his platelets above 20-30.

3) Petechial rash/LE edema - The patient had very low platelet
counts and was maintained above platalet count of 10. However,
he developed a petechial rash over his lower extermities, on the
anterior aspects of his tibias. This was thought to be due to
thrombocytopenia in the setting of severe edema. The edema was
thought secondary to low albumin of 2.1 as his echo was normal.
His tranfusion threshold was increased to 20-30 and he was given
some lasix to help diurese the extra fluid, which helped
somewhat but increased his creatinine slightly so was
discontinued at discharge. He was given aquaphor ointment for
his legs to prevent dryness and bleeding.

4) SIADH - The patient had a sodium level of 129 at admission
and a low of 126. This did not respond to fluids and the patient
was euvolemic with a decreased uric acid level, so he likely has
SIADH of unclear etiology. He was fluid restricted and given
some lasix with improvement in his sodium level to 135 at
discharge.

5) The patient was DNR/DNI during admission per previous
outpatient status.
