Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Exertional CP, multivessel disease, respiratory arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2126-2-7**] Coronary artery bypass graft x 3 with the left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and
reverse saphenous vein graft to the left posterior descending
artery and the first diagonal artery.

History of Present Illness:
(Patient intubated and sedated all information obtained from
medical records) 66 year old male who presented to OSH with 6
months of exertional angina. Pain increased and persisted on
[**1-30**] therefore he went to his PCP for further evaluation, he
also complained of Shortness of braeth and arm pain on arrival
at his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] showed ST depressions in the lateral leads,
therefore EMS was called and he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 **]
ED for further evaluation. 3 SLNTG were given by EMS with some
improvement in his symptoms. In the [**Hospital1 **] ED, he was
hypertensive and tachycardic, continued to complain of arm pain.
Trops elevated to 0.24. He was taken emergently to cath lab,
where he was found to have multivessel disease. After the case,
patient began coughing and was dyspnic, began coughing
blood-tinged sputum. He was treated for pulmonary edema with 40
IV lasix however he then went into respiratory arrest and
required intubation. He recieved 1 mg Atropine for bradycardia
and a swan and IAPB were placed on cath lab table. PCWP was
15mmHg following initial diuresis, getting IVF at 50cc/hr.
Cardiac output 4.0 with index of 1.8. He was given 1g Ancef for
perclose coverage. On arrival to the CCU, the pt is intubated,
sedated, non-responsive to voice. Unable to obtain ROS due to
sedation. Referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization.

Pertinent Results:
[**2126-2-7**] Echo: Prebypass: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesia of the apical and mid portions of
the inferior walls. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45-50% %). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma
in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results on [**2126-2-7**] at 1100am.
Post bypass: Patient is A paced. Biventricular systolic function
is unchanged. Aorta is intact post decannulation. Moderate
mitral regurgitation persists.
.
[**2126-1-31**] Carotid U/S: There is 60-69% stenosis within the
internal carotid arteries bilaterally.

[**2126-2-10**]
CXR PA and Lat:
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable with unremarkable
appearance of
post-sternotomy wires and surgical clips. There is no change in
the left
lower lobe consolidation most likely representing atelectasis
accompanied by small amount of pleural effusion. Right pleural
effusion is small, unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with 6 months of
crescendo angina s/p NSTEMI in the setting of 3 vessel coronary
artery disease, complicated by cardiogenic shock, hypoxemic
respiratory failure and acute kidney injury, consistent with
AKIN stage II.  He developed metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia
with worsening
oliguria.  His hyperkalemia was as high as 7.4 and was
accompanied with peaked T-waves. Nephrology was consulted and he
underwent one cycle of intermittent hemodialysis.  His
creatinine began to decrease to his baseline of 1.7 and his
cultures were all negative.  He was brought to the operating
room on [**2126-2-7**] where the patient underwent coronary artery
bypass graft x 3 with the left internal mammary artery to the
left anterior descending artery and reverse saphenous vein graft
to the left posterior descending artery and the first diagonal
artery.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.   POD 1 found
the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing
comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed
toward the preoperative weight.

The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  Creatinine remained around his baseline
of 1.7 with good response to diuresis.  The patient was
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with
strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 5 the
patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain
was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged
home with visiting nurse services on post operative day 5 in
good condition with appropriate follow up instructions. Statins
were not restarted because of elevated LFTs. These should be
rechecked with his PCP before restarting.
