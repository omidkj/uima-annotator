History of Present Illness:
This is an 83yo male with chronic systolic congestive heart

Pertinent Results:
[**2169-5-20**] Transthoracic Echo:
The right atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 25 %) with global hypokinesis and regional
septal and apical akinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

[**2169-5-20**] Renal Ultrasound:
1. Normal kidneys, without hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or
mass lesion. 2. Large ascites.

[**2169-5-23**] Abdominal Ultrasound:
1. Contracted gallbladder with gallstone identified within it.
        2. Moderate amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
3. Bidirectional flow with reflux noted in the hepatic veins
with associated pulsatile flow in the portal vein - findings are
consistent with sequelae of right heart failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent epicardial lead placement
via left mini-thoracotomy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. For surgical details,
please see operative note. Following the operation, he was
brought to the CVICU in stable condition. Within 24 hours, he
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without incident.
Device check on postoperative day one showed a normal
functioning biventricular ICD. He otherwise maintained stable
hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on postoperative day
one. On postoperative day two, he became oliguric and
hypotensive with little response to fluid resuscitation.
Creatinine was rising, and patient became hyperkalemic. Renal
ultrasound showed normal appearing kidneys while echocardiogram
revealed no evidence of tamponade. Renal ultrasound was however
notable for large amount of ascites. He returned to the CVICU
for invasive monitoring. He was started on inotropes and CVVH
was initiated. Given findings of ascites, Warfarin was held for
the possibility of paracentesis. Renal service was consulted and
continued to manage CVVH.  It appeared much of his acute on
chronic renal failure was attributed to contrast nephropathy
dating back to [**2169-4-11**] during failed attempt for percutaneous
left ventricular lead placement. Over several days, urine output
improved as did his creatinine. He gradually weaned from
inotropic support. He was transitioned from CVVH to intermittent
hemodialysis via tunnelled right internal jugular catheter. He
did have a 80 mg IV Lasix trial and made minimal urine in
response. His foley was removed and he is to be straight cathed
Q 24 hrs - last hemodialysis run was [**5-31**]. He is on a Mon Wed
Friday schedule for HD. He continued to make good progress and
was cleared for discharge to [**Hospital1 **] at [**Doctor Last Name 1263**] in
[**Location (un) 686**] on POD # 13 in stable condition Target INR 2.0- 2.5
for chronic A Fib. All follow up appointments were advised.
