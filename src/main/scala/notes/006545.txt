Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2109-6-30**] Successful POBA of LCX and OM2.



History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 69 year old male with history of coronary artery
disease (stsatus post CABG [**2100**] with LIMA to LAD, RIMA to RPDA,
SVG to LCx), s/p PCI in [**2105**] (Cypher stent to LCx) and COPD who
developed acute shortness of breath around midnight the night of
presentation. He took his nebulizers without improvement in his
symptoms, so he called EMS. Enroute to hospital, he began to
have 8/10 chest pain radiating to left and right arm, along with
some nausea, but no diaphoresis. He noted that these symptoms
were similar to his prior myocardial infarction. He was given
nitroglycerin spray without significant improvement. He was
initially taken to [**Hospital3 **] where an EKG was noted to
have lateral STE (V5-V6) ST depressions in V1. He then developed
further chest pain and had diffuse STE II, III, F. He was given
80 mg lipitor, clopidogrel 600 mg, heparin bolus and trasnferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] catherization lab. He was also given Solumedrol at
[**Hospital3 **] for possible COPD exacerbation. In the [**Hospital1 18**]
catherizaiton lab, he was found to have an in-stent thrombosis
in the LCx. He had an atherectomy and had kissing ballon
dilation of the LCx lesion. Some residual clot was noted. He was
continued on heparin and integrillin double bolus, as well as
300 plavix in the catherization lab.
.
Patient was transferred to ICU. He denies any chest pain now. He
states he has had progressive worsening in exercise tolerance
and shortness of breath over the past year. He denies
PND/Orthopnea, syncope. Denies leg claudication. ROS denies any
fevers, chills recently.

CARDIAC CATH performed on [**6-30**] demonstrated:
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed 3
vessel
coronary artery and late-instent thrombosis. The LMCA had no
significant
disease. The LAD had a 60% proximal stenosis with a 95% mid
stenosis.
The LCX had a 40% proximal stenosis with a 100% mid instent
thrombosis
at the bifurcation of OM2. The RCA had a 60% proximal stenosis
with an
80% distal stenosis.
2. Arterial conduit arteriography revealed a patent
free LIMA (off the aorta) to the LAD and D1. There was also a
patent
free RIMA to the right PDA. The SVG to OM1 and OM2 was occluded
proximally which appeared chronic.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed moderately elevated right sided
filling
pressures with normal left sided filling pressures. The RA mean
pressure
was 10 mm Hg, RVEDP 15 mm Hg with a RVSP of 51 mm Hg. The PASP
was 51 mm
Hg. The PCWP was 12 mm Hg. The estimated cardiac output was 8
and the
index 4 l/min/m2.
4. Left ventriculography was deferred.
5. Successful PTCA of LCX with 2.5mm balloon and the OM2 with a
2.0mm
balloon. Normal flow down vessel with some residual thrombus at
end of
procedure. Patient left cathlab in stable condition.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Successful POBA of LCX and OM2.

[**2109-6-30**]:
Chest X-Ray
Cardiac size is within normal limits. No evidence of failure is
present. The
costophrenic angles are sharp. The lung fields are clear.
Flattening of the
diaphragms and general distortion of the lung markings indicate
the presence
of COPD, probably worse on the right than the left.

IMPRESSION: COPD, no failure
.
[**2109-7-1**]
Transthoracic Echo:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal
hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral wall. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 50 %). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root
and ascending aorta are mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is high normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrpohy with
mild regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Dilated ascending
aorta.

 IMPRESSION:

Interval opacification of both lung bases compatible with
aspiration. The
remainder of the study is relatively unchanged.



Brief Hospital Course:
# Coronary artery disease, ischemia: Patient presented with ST
elevations on EKG and was immediately taken to cardiac
catherizaiton. It was found that he had had a ST elevation
myocardial infarction secondary to acute stent thrombosis of his
left circumflex stent. This was a rather late stent thrombosis
as his PCI was 3 yearrs ago and he had been off plavix for about
2 years. He underwent atherectomy to the left circumflex artery,
however has some clot remained after balloon dilation.  The
patient was managed with aspirin 325 mg, and Plavix 75 mg was
re-started. He should continue on this regimen indefinitely.
Patient was also treated with a high dose statin (atorvastatin
80 daily). He had no further symptoms.  He was kept on heparin
and intergillin drips for 48 hours given the residual thrombus
noted during catherization.
.
# Heart function: Patient did not have an echocardiogram in our
system. A transthoracic echo was completed and demonstrated an
ejection fraction of 50%. Patient had some evidence of mild
fluid overload, and was given some lasix with good diuresis and
improvement in his respiratory status.
.
# Rhythm: Patient was noted to initially have a significant
amount of ectopy with short runs of non-sustained ventricular
tachycardia. The amount of ectopy significantly decreased and
was minimal after 24-48 hours. Patient's beta-blocker was
increased as tolerated by his heart rate and blood pressure.
.
# Hypertension: Patient's regimen included metoprolol and an
ace-inhibitor, both of which were aggressively adjusted until
his blood pressure and heart rate were at goal.
.
# Respiratory/COPD: Patient was initially given a dose of
solumedrol at the outside hospital. He is on [**2-17**] L of nasal
cannula oxygen at home, and was quickly weaned back to his home
oxygen requirement. He was diuresed as well, and had significant
subjective improvement in his brea
