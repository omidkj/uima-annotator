[**2169-4-24**] CXR - Slight improvement in right lower lobe opacity
which may reflect resolving atelectasis or improving pneumonia.
Small bilateral pleural effusions.

[**2169-4-24**] Carotid Ultrasound - 1. Occlusion of the left internal
carotid artery. 2. Close to 70% stenosis of the right internal
carotid artery. The plaque begins in the distal common carotid
artery and extends into the internal carotid artery on the
right.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 67379**] arrived to [**Hospital1 18**] in stable condition. He was pain free
on intravenous Heparin and Nitroglycerin. Later that day, he was
taken to the operating room where Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed three
vessel coronary artery bypass grafting. The operation was
uneventful. For surgical details, please see seperate dictated
operative note. After the operation, he was brought to the CSRU
for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. He experienced bouts of
paroxsymal atrial fibrillation for which Amiodarone therapy was
initiated. He otherwise maintained stable hemodynamics and
weaned from inotropic support without difficulty. On
postoperative day two, he transferred to the SDU. He eventually
converted back to a normal sinus rhythm on postoperative day
three. No further bouts of atrial fibrillation were noted for
the rest of his hospital stay. He tolerated and was maintained
on low dose beta blockade and Amiodarone. He otherwise continued
to maintain good hemodynamics and continued to make steady
improvements with diuresis. He worked daily with physical
therapy to improve strength and mobility. Medical therapy was
optimized and he was medically cleared for discharge to rehab on
postoperative day five. Prior to discharge, a carotid ultrasound
was obtained to further evaluate his carotid disease and
findings of bilateral carotid bruits. Ultrasound revealed an
occlusion of the left internal carotid artery, and close to a
70% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. Based on
these findings, Mr. [**Known lastname 67379**] should follow up with a vascular
surgeon at the [**Hospital1 18**] or in [**State 792**]for surgical evaluation.
