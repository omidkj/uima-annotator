Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right IJ placement ([**2121-1-12**])
Arterial line placement ([**2121-1-12**])
Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
60M history of IVDU, alcoholism (4 years ago), cirrhosis
secondary to Hepatitis C complicated by metabolic and hepatic
encephalopathy, CKD, seizure disorder, asthma, hypertension,
anxiety that was found down apneic and taken to [**Hospital3 12594**].

Per his girlfriend, the patient lives alone. His girlfriend of
six years went to check on him on 2:30 AM. Patient with very
tired appearing. He has was having difficulty with breathing in
a manner where he had to take "deep breaths in and out." He also
had "rattling in his chest." Girlfriend called the ambulance
given breathing and he was also difficult to arouse. Patient has
visiting [**Hospital3 269**] that distributes medications, so girlfriend feels
like he has not overdosed and has not abused drugs for quite
sometime. He also does have a tendency for pneumonia. He was
last hospitalized two weeks for bronchitis with a four day
course. He was in his otherwise normal state of health
yesterday.

He was transported to [**Hospital6 19155**] at 2:43 AM on
[**2121-1-12**]. He was found unresponsive by EMS with a RR of [**1-11**]
breaths/minute. Initial GCS was 10 (E3-V2-V5). He was found to
have pinpoint pupils and was administered Narcan 2 mg IV x 2
without effect. He was fluid resuscitated (unknown amount) and
started on neosynephrine with BP nadir of 61/43 (MAP 56) and
high of 237/118 (MAP 140). Neosynephrine was discontinued, and
levophed was initiated. Stress dose steroids were also started
(solu-cortef 100 mg IV). A CXR showed vancomycin 1 gram IV,
flagyl, ? and rocephin for ? pneumonia. Head CT scan showed
hypoattenuation in basal ganglia bilaterally suggesting
ischemia. NIH was score 11. ECG showed sub-millimeter ST
elevations in II,III,aVF with troponin 0.14 and lactate 3.3. He
was started on heparin IV infusion @ 1380 units/hr. ABG was pH
7.26 pCO2 56, pO2 63, HCO3 251 with BE -2.7.

Labs were significant for Na 140, K 4, CL 88, HCO3 24, BUN 18,
Cr 1.9 (unknown baseline), Glc 163. WBC 15.6 Hgb 13.5, Hct 40.9,
Plt 156. CK 93 CK-MB 5.2, AST 29, ALT 22. Tox screen was
positive for benzodiazepine and opiates. Coags were PT 12.3, INR
1.1, PTT 28, Troponin 0.14.

He was intubated by [**Location (un) **] for poor mental status/airway
protection in order to transport him to [**Hospital1 18**]. He was given
succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg IVP, etomidate 20 mg IVP. Intubated
was uncomplicated. He was given fentanyl 100 mg IV x 2,
midazolam 1 mg IV x 1. He was on levophed 12 mcg/min.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED inital vitals were not given in signout and
charting is not available for review in documents from ER.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ER, multiple interventions were performed. ECG
showed ST-elevations not meeting criteria (< 1mm) in the
inferior (II,aVF) and lateral leads. Cardiology was consulted,
and performed a bedside ECHO showing normal EF, no hypokinesis,
no effusion. There was no evidence of endocarditis or overt
valvular pathology. Heparin infusion was stopped given STEMI
thought to be unlikely.

Levophed was discontinued with resultant BP of 60/40. CVC was
placed with no CVP performed. Urine output not commented.

Patient was also placed in a C-collar given C-spine was never
cleared given patient unconscious.

Exam was significant for petechiae on RLE.

He was given zosyn for broader coverage.

It is overall uncertain how much fluid he received in [**Hospital1 18**] ER
and OSH ER as these are not documented clearly in chart or
documents not available.

Labs were performed. Coags were PT 14.8, PTT 49.5, INR 1.4.

Chemistry panel was within normal limits except K 5.4 (H), BUN
16, Cr 1.2 (unknown baseline, eGFR 62), glucose 180 and normal
anion gap.

Lactate was 2.5.

CBC showed WBC 12, Hgb 12.5 (unknown baseline), Plt 138 (unknown
baseline) with neutrophilia.

Initial TropnT was 0.02.

LFTS including lipase within normal limits except albumin 3.

VBG was significant for pH 7.25, pCO2 56, pO2 102, HCO3 26.

Serum tox was negative.

Blood cultures were drawn.

ECG showed SR with PR prolongation (230 ms), NA/NI, early repol
in I, II and lateral leads. No acute STEMI or ST/T changes
concerning for ischemia.

VS on transfer:
HR 69, 135/79, pOx 100 % on 500x18, PEEP 5, FiO2 100.
Levophed @ 0.2

On arrival to the ICU, patient was comfortably intubated,
non-responsive.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. Left femoral deformity, displacement and hardware of
indeterminate
chronicity, with intermediate density in the joint space.
Correlation with
clinical history and prior imaging, if available, would be
helpful. Acute
trauma and infection cannot be excluded.
2. Evidence for portal hypertension, including splenomegaly and
recanalized
paraumbilical veins, likely secondary to cirrhosis.
3. Bilateral pulmonary opacities, concerning for aspiration.
4. Trace perihepatic ascites.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]:
1. Bright DWI and FLAIR signal in the bilateral globus pallidus
with no
evidence of corresponding bright signal on ADC may represent a
sub-acute
hypoxic injury or other metabolic/toxic process.
2. Ethmoid and left mastoid air cells fluid. Correlate
clinically.
3. Unremarkable MRA of the head.
