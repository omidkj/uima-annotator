Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
VT and ICD shocks

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Electrophysiology study and VT ablation


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 83 year old man with CAD s/p CABG (23yrs ago),
ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 20-25%), hx of afib and SSS, and VT
s/p ICD implantation presenting with syncope. The patient
initially presented to [**Hospital6 33**] on [**2121-7-10**] after 2
episodes of syncope. He has had pre-syncopal events that have
been associated with a wave of dizziness often lasting [**3-4**]
seconds while standing. On the day of admission he was out to
breakfast with a friend and while riding in the care he started
to feel lightheaded and lost consciousness. Per report of the
friend, the patient was unconscious for ~3-5 seconds. About [**5-10**]
minutes later he had a second event.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital6 33**] he was afebrile with stable
vital signs. His EKG was v-paced. His initial CK was 86, Tn
<0.02, and serum potassium was 3.2. He was admitted to the
telemetry floor. His ICD was interrogated and per report
multiple episodes of Vt usually cycle lenghth of 2 different
rates, multiple episodses at 150-160 bpm with termination by ATP
and muliple episodes at 190 bpm terminted by ATP. VT episodes on
the day of admission were sustained with rates of 197 bpm which
failed to terminate with 3 cycles of ATP and required 26 j
shock.
On the morning of [**2121-7-11**] he was found by the nurses nauseated,
diaphoretic and telemetry reported showed VT that was treated by
his ICD. He was started on an amiodarone bolus then gtt (~930am)
and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. En route to [**Hospital1 18**] he had 3 more events
with subsequent ICD discharges and restoration of sinus rhythm.

.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies dysuria but has 1/night
nocturia. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest
pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema.

CXR - There is substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
in a patient with multiple clips and midline sternal sutures
from CABG. The defibrillator leads are seen extending to the
general region of the right atrium and apex of the right
ventricle. No definite pleural effusion, vascular congestion, or
acute pneumonia, though the area behind the heart cannot be
properly evaluated for possible atelectasis or consolidation.


Brief Hospital Course:
83 year old man with history of CAD s/p CABG, ischemic
cardiomyopathy (EF 20%), paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (on
amiodarone and coumadin), s/p ICD implantation  and pacemaker,
presenting with syncope, found to have multiple episodes of
prolonged VT.  Now s/p VT ablation on [**7-14**] showing inducible
ventricular tachycardia on right side.
.
# Rhythm:
The patient has a known history of PAF and VT. He presented to
an outside hospital with episodes of VT with syncope and ICD
discharges. Interrogation of ICD showed multiple episodes of
ventricular tachycardia CL 310 msec (all of which had a warm up
phase - automatic or triggered), some requiring ATP and
requiring ICD discharge.  Home dose of digoxin was discontinued
on admission as it likely contributed to NSVT.  Amiodarone was
discontinued as the patient's ICD continued to discharde despite
amiodarone bolus and drip.  He was instead started on a
lidocaine drip.  As his telemetry remained without any further
events other than occasional short runs of NSVT, his lidocaine
drip was discontinued.  An EP study on [**2121-7-14**] showed VT most
inducible on R side near pacer wire; likely due to wires or old
scar. Ventricular ablation was stopped prematurely secondary to
fluoroscopy failure. Following the ventricular ablation the
patient had occasional PVCs, and afib and was restarted on
amiodarone for rhythm control. Following the EP study,
amiodarone was increased to 200mg daily to maintain NSR and
prevent atrial fibrillation. The patient was transitioned to
warfarin on a heparin bridge with a goal INR [**2-2**], currently 1.9.

.
# Hematoma: The patient developed a large ecchymosis after
sheath was pulled on right groin site, with extension to right
scrotum and laterally to right hip.  Following sheath removal
pressure was held for 30 minutes.  Pt continues to have good
pulses with no bruit; hematoma has spread superficially but is
not indurated. Hematocrit remained stable.
.
# Hypotension: Pt developed hypotension with SBPs in 70s
following the VT ablation.  This was presumed to be due to
dehydration and not a bleed from the right groin catheter site
as hematocrit was stable and the groin ecchymosis was
superficial.  It was not determined to be due to tamponade as no
clinical signs or symptoms (no JVD, crisp heart sounds, pulsus
6, not tachycardic, good UO) were present.  Pt's blood pressure
improved with fluids and oral intake.
.
# CAD/Ischemia: The pt has known disease and risk factors but
there was no evidence of active ischemia on this admission.  The
patient was not on aspirin due to a history of PUD but he was
continued on atorvastatin, carvedilol and losartan.
.
# CHF: Pt was clinically euvolemic and sans evidence of
decompensation on physical exam throughout this admission.  He
was continued on his home doses of carvedilol 6.25 [**Hospital1 **] and
losartan 25mg QD. His lasix was continued at 20 mg QAM and the
evening lasix was discontinued. His home spironolactone 25mg
daily was continued.
.
# Sleep apnea: Patient did well on home CPAP machine.
.
# Hypothyroidism: TSH was checked and was within normal limits.
