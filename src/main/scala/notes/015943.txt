History of Present Illness:
21 year old woman with a history of ESRD, SLE, lupus nephritis,
BOOP, h/o pericarditis, who was admitted for exertional
dyspnea/orthopnea. SHe is now transferred for acute desat on the
floor.
.
Her symptoms began yesterday after HD. SHe complains of DOE  and
orthopnea. She had to sleep sitting up in a chair last night.
Dry weight after HD yesterday was 54kg. She was seen in clinic
yesterday for scheduled appointment and was sent from clinic.
Her weight was 56 kg. Of note, she was recently admitted in

with dialysis.
.
In the ED, initial VS T97 P88 BP164/124 R18 95% on RA she was
given her home doses of celexa and metoprolol as well as a dose
of ambien. On the floor, patient trigerred for desat to 88% on
RA and increased to 100% on NRB. Other VS were R50 T99.4 P102
BP172/102. EKG was unchanged. Hydralazine 10mg and ethacrynic

EKG: sinus tachycardia, nl axis, nl intervals, old T wave
inversions anterolaterally, good voltage, no QRS alterations

Echo [**11-5**]- The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular  hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (EF
30-35%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good  leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears  structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral  valve prolapse. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive  filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. The end-diastolic
pulmonic  regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting
pulmonary artery diastolic  hypertension. There is a small (0.7
cm behind LA, 1.0 cm lateral to RV) pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course:  21 yof with ESRD, SLE admitted with SOB on the
floor to the MICU.  Patient's hypoxia most likely [**1-2**] pulmonary
edema, given similar prior hx, some weight gain, and appearance
on CXR.  No evidence of pneumonia.  Echo showed slightly lower
EF compared to previous and small pericardial effusion.  Patient
was dialysed for ~4L negative in the ICU and her symptoms
improved.  PE was lower on the differential for her hypoxia, and
CTA was deferred given her marked improvement after dialysis.
Patient was also hypertensive on admission to the ICU and also
during hemodialysis.  She was given one dose of nifedipine 10mg
along with resuming her medications.  Her lisinopril was
increased to 40 mg daily from 20mg.  Norvasc was continued at
outpatient dose.  Echocargiogram was obtained which showed small
pericardial effusion as well as a depressed EF.  Cardiology was
consulted and recommended a cardiac MRI to evaluate the observed
pattern of diastolic dysfunction to see if there may be
myocardial enhacement or edema related to SLE.  In addition,
toprol was increased and changed to toprol XL at 200mg daily.
She was discharged home with plans to have regularly scheduled
dialysis tomorrow, have outpatient MRI and f/u with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**] from cardiology.  Prescription for toprol xl was provided.
