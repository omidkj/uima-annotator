mechanical valve

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 53 year old female with a history of mitral
valve disease and heart failure 2 years and 3 months after
resection of a large left atrial myxoma and mitral valve repair
with annuloplasty ring. Since the time of her surgery, she has
continued to have very limited exercise tolerance and gets short
of breath with routine activities such as climbing stairs,
grocery shopping etc. She has not had orthopnea or PND and has
not had any acute episodes of severe dyspnea since beginning
medical therapy with furosemide and lisinopril. Her last echo in
[**Month (only) 596**] showed moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. She is very
dissatisfied with her current quality of life and is depressed.
She has thus been referred for evaluation for a redo mitral
valve replacement.

Pertinent Results:
[**2131-2-8**] Intraop Echo: Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in
the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. A
mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.The jet is
transvalvular,etiology from a coaptation defect bettween the
anterior and residual remnant of the posterior mitral valve
replacement.
Post Bypass: Patient is now s/p 27 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical Mitral
valve replacement on a Norepinephrine drip at 0.06 mcg/kg/min.
The cardiac output is 5.2lpm. The mechanical mitral valve is
well seated with appropriate washing jets observed.There are no
paravalvular leaks observed. The mean gradient across the Mitral
valve is 4mmHg. The ventricular function is preserved with an
EF>55%. There are no visible aortic dissection flaps observed.
.
[**2131-2-14**] Discharge Chest x-ray: The tiny right apical
pneumothorax is decreased and the miniscule left apical
pneumothorax is unchanged. Small bilateral pleural effusions are
unchanged. Opacification of the right middle lobe has increased.
Linear left basilar atelectasis is unchanged. Moderate
cardiomegaly is unchanged and has  a normal post-operative
appearance. A prosthetic mitral valve is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit and on [**2131-2-8**] was brought
directly to the operating room where she [**Date Range 1834**] a
redo-sternotomy, and mitral valve replacement. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Following surgery she was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and was extubated without incident. On post-op day one,
beta-blockers and diuretics were started. On post-op day two she
was transferred to the step-down floor for further care and
recovery. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed
without complication. Coumadin was started with a Heparin bridge
until patient's INR was therapeutic. Given the mechanical mitral
valve, Coumadin was dosed daily and titrated for a goal INR
between 3.0 - 3.5. She experienced a postoperative delirium
which improved with several days of Haldol. By discharge, her
mental status improved significantly. Over several days, she
otherwise continued to make clinical improvements with diuresis.
She remained in a normal sinus rhythm as beta blockade was
advanced as tolerated.  She was cleared for discharge to home on
postoperative day seven. Prior to discharge, outpatient Coumadin
followup was arranged with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Hospital6 733**].
