History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 35984**] is a 50-year-old gentleman with a PMH significant for
IVDU, chronic pain on suboxone, and hepatitis C now admitted for
somnolence and concern for clonidine overdose. The patient was
at CVS today waiting for his suboxone prescription. At that
time, he was noted to be increasingly somnolent, and EMS was
called. Per report, patient received 2 doses of intranasal
narcan without improvement in mental status.
.

screen and labs and ECG were unremarkable. The patient was
somnolent, and had minimal improvement in mental status with an
additional dose of 0.8 mg naloxone. Toxicology was consulted,
with concern for clonidine overdose. He was noted to have a SBP
in the 90-100s with a HR in the 60s, he received 4L IVF, and was
admitted to the MICU for further management.
.
Currently, the patient is somnolent but arousable. He is
complaining of chronic lower leg pain and right hand pain.  He
is unable to state why he is here, if he has fallen or had any
recent trauma. Denies any CP/SOB, f/c/s, n/v/d, abd pain.

CXR [**2152-2-29**]: Overdose and O2 requirement.  Comparison is made to
prior study dating back [**2149-3-4**].  Cardiac size is top normal.
There is mild vascular congestion. There is no pneumothorax or
pleural effusion.

HEAD CT W/OUT CONTRAST [**2152-2-29**]: IMPRESSION:
No acute interval change.

R HAND X-RAY [**2152-2-29**]: HISTORY: Right hand pain and swelling.
There is soft tissue swelling overlying the dorsum of the hand.
Old healed
boxer fracture deformity of the fifth metacarpal. There is a
tiny soft tissue calcification adjacent to the distal first
metacarpal of doubtful
significance. No overt acute fracture and no bone destruction or
joint space narrowing. Localizing history might be helpful.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 35984**] is a 50 year old gentleman with a PMH significant for
IVDU, chronic pain on suboxone, and hepatitis C now admitted for
somnolence and concern for clonidine overdose.
.
# OVERDOSE/AMS: Given transient hypotension and lack of
compensatory tachcyardia, concern for clonidine overdose given
that this is a known medication for the patient.  Somnolence and
small pupils would also be consistent with this toxidrome. ECG
without evidence of AV nodal block, and nothing to suggest that
patient had concomitent AV nodal blockade with a beta blocker or
CCB. Urine tox screen positive for barbiturate with negative
serum barbiturate level, which per lab is c/w barbituate use in
the last 2 weeks but not more recently. Suboxone overdose also
less likely as pt given naloxone with no effect.  Patient was
treated with IVF and airway was monitored.  He was ordered for
social work and addiction consults.  Toxicology signed off,
having no further recommendtions.  Serial EKGs did not show
evidence of QT prolongation beyond his baseline (obtained as QTc
of 479 from [**Hospital1 2177**] EKG in [**2149**]).  Outside records from pain clinic
and PCP were obtained, which showed that patient has been on the
same medications for months and despite occasional substance
abuse (cocaine, barbituates), has been off heroin for 14 months.

.
# HYPOXEMIA: Patient with new supplemental oxygen requirement.
ABG on room air 7.37/48/64, with A-a gradient of 25. Likely due
to alveolar hypoventilation in the setting of CNS depression.
Oxygenation improved as patient's mental status cleared.
