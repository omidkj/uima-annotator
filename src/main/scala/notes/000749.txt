Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3276**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Please see admission note for full details of history. Ms.
[**Name14 (STitle) 102143**] is a 69 year old female with past medical history of
right lower lobe squamous cell carcinoma, status-post resection
in [**2141**], treated with chemotherapy and thoracentesis in [**11/2142**],
who brain radiation in [**12/2141**], and recent admission for
pneumonia in [**12/2142**] treated with levofloxacin. Likely
leptomeningeal spread.
.
She presented to the ED [**2-16**] with dyspnea and increasing home O2
requirement. Her home nurse had also recently noted low BP,
causing her to miss her daily amiodarone and metoprolol. Her
dyspnea progressed from exertional to at rest over days. She
also had a chest discomfort, nonpleuritic. No fevers, chills, or
change in chronic productive cough. ROS otherwise negative.
.
Her initial vital signs were a temperature of 97.0, [**Month/Year (2) **]
pressure of 110/59, heart rate of 132, respiratory rate of 20,
and 91% on room air. She was given 2 mg of morphine, 4 mg of
zofran, 150 mg bolus of amiodarone IV, 200 mg of PO amiodarone,
5 mg of roxicet, 325 mg of tylenol, amiodarone drip, fentanyl 50
mcg, and 750 mg of levofloxacin. In the ED, she was initially
tachycardic with a heart rate as high as 140, but this converted
to sinus at a rate of 70 after administration of amiodarone.
There was concern for worsening metastatic disease or PE, so she
underwent a chest CT. It was negative for a pulmonary embolism,
however it did demonstrate a worsening multifocal pneumonia and
worsening metastatic disease as compared to PET/CT from
[**2143-1-21**]. During the time in the ED, her systolic [**Year (4 digits) **] pressure
ranged from 70-90's. She was given one liter of IVF. She was
transfered to the ICU for further management given her
hypotension and high oxygen requirement.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], there was concern for amiodarone pulmonary
toxicity, so this medication was stopped. Cardiology followed
her and recommended continuation of low-dose beta blocker.
Antibiotics were broadened to Bactrim (for possible PCP given
chronic steroid use) and levofloxacin. There was consideration
of broncoscopy for the purpose of BAL for culture, but the
patient declined. Currently she is on a non-rebreather with good
O2 Sats. She is also on stress-dose steroids given chronic
prednisone. She was given 2 units of pRBC.
.
Goals of care were addressed and revised to include DNR and no
invasive measures. Palliative care is following. She will be
transferred to the OMED team given no desire for ICU-level
aggressive measures.
. HR 60 110/53 16 97% NRB. Got levoflox already today. 1L
positive. Also given 2u pRBC's.
.
Main goal at this time is for hospice, palliative care on board.
Not bronched per patient request. Will accept abx, but nothing
invasive.

Past Medical History:
Oncology History:
T2 N1 squamous cell lung cancer in the right lower lobe s/p
resection [**2142-6-11**]. Pathology notable for a positive margin,
lymphatic, and venous invasion. She is s/p chemo radiation and
resection of the right-sided lesion. She is s/p four cycles of
carboplatin and paclitaxel with the fourth cycle of chemotherapy
on [**2142-10-16**]. [**2142-11-27**] [**Year (4 digits) 4338**] of head with concern for
metastatic disease with a 5-mm enhancing lesion in the left
frontal lobe and a new 6 x 6 x 5 mm enhancing lesion in the
right parietal lobe with mild associated edema concerning for
cortical or leptomeningeal metastatic disease.
.
[**2142-12-7**] thoracentesis to drain left pleural effusion given
symptomatic cough. No evidence of malignancy with resolution of
cough but continued shortness of breath with exertion. CXR on
[**2142-12-11**] showed a persistent small left pleural effusion.
.
[**2142-12-18**] whole brain radiation therapy and radiation therapy to
her sacral metastasis with intermittent pain requiring dilaudid,
nausea and dry heaves requring compazine. She continued to have
chronic lower extremity weakness which has not changed in
severity.
.
[**2142-12-31**] Patient completed course of radiation to C2 Whole Brain
and Sacrum. She received a total dose of 3000 cGy to each site.
Of note she has had increased sacral pain and worsening nausea
and dry heaves. She was attempting Zofran, and dilaudid 2 mg Q6
as needed for pain. She also reported slight worsening of her
shortness of breath. No pleuritic chest pain. At that time o2
sat 94%RA.

Social History:
Married. Smoked in the past but quit 25 years ago, denies
alcohol or illicit drug use.


Family History:
The patient's father died of CAD as did her mother.  Two
brothers have CAD.  A sister has had multiple TIAs.


Physical Exam:
Vital Signs BP 110/53, HR 76, O2 Sat 96% on NRB
GENERAL: pleasant woman, appears comfortable
HEENT: slopecia, pupils small but reactive, no scleral icterus
NECK: supple, JVP not appreciated
LUNGS: decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion over
left base, diffuse bronchial breath sounds over b/l lung fields
CARDIAC: regular, no murmurs
ABDOMEN: soft, nontender, nondistended
EXTR: warm, no edema, ecchymoses over right tibia.
NEURO: alert and oriented
PSYCH: pleasant, appropriate
.

Pertinent Results:
[**2143-2-16**] CTPA

1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

2. Persistent diffuse ground-glass opacity in the right upper
lobe and
worsened ground-glass within the lingula are concerning for
worsening
multifocal infection.

3. Increased size of pulmonary nodules concerning for worsening
metastatic
disease.

[**2143-2-18**] Echo
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypo/akinesis
of the basal half of the inferiorseptum, inferior, and
inferolateral walls. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 50 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. At least moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity size with regional systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. At least
moderate mitral regurgitation suggestive of papillary muscle
dysfunction.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-6-13**], the
severity of mitral regurgitation has increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 94074**] is a 69 year old female with past medical history
of squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation who presented
with dyspnea and was found to have multifocal pneumonia.
.
#) Multifocal pneumonia: Likely related to underlying cancer,
possibly post-obstructive. O2 Sats were mostly in the upper 90s
on nonrebreather. Patient initially wanted like to continue
antibiotics, but has declined elective intubation for BAL
cultures after sputum cx contaminated. Thus she was transferred
to OMED given no desire for aggressive measures. There goals of
care were further revised ot include comfort measures only.
Antibiotics were stopped.  Stress dose steroids were quickly
tapered.  She was given nebulizer treatments as needed for
comfort.  Because there was a question of mild volume overload,
she was also given lasix 20 mg IV as needed, which seemed to
help.  A foley was placed to improve comfort of urination given
that she was becoming short of breath with any transfer.
.
#) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR
in the setting of missing amiodarone. Con
