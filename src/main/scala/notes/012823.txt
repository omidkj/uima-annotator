Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Pleural effusion/Pericardial effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2195-4-7**] - Mediastinal exploration and mediastinal
hematoma evacuation.


History of Present Illness:
This 82-year-old gentleman with known atrial fibrillation and an
atrial myxoma who underwent serial echocardiograms that have
revealed worsening aortic
insufficiency and mitral regurgitation. Based on these findings,
he underwent an aortic valve replacement as well as mitral valve
replacement and atrial myxoma excision. This was performed on
[**2195-3-23**].  He was discharged home and while he was in a hotel
where he was staying, several days after he was discharged, he
had a syncopal episode. During the syncopal episode, the family
dialed 911 , the patient was hypotensive w/respiratory distress
and was intubated. A large left pleural effusion was drained for
1400 cc serosanguinous
fluid. After the patient was hemodynamically stabilized, he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. he underwent an echocardiogram which
revealed a large mediastinal hematoma with some signs of early
tamponade. Based on these findings, it was decided to take the
patient back to the operating room .

[**2195-4-5**] ECHO
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed with mid to distal
anteroseptal and apical hypokinesis/akinesis and mild/moderate
hypokinesis elsewhere. Anterior wall may be hypokinetic but is
not fully visualized. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present and appears well-seated (gradients not assessed). No
aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve
prosthesis is present and appears well-seated with probably
normal gradients. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a moderate to
large sized pericardial effusion (most prominent inferolateral
to the left ventricle and adjacent to the right ventricle in the
subcostal view). The effusion is partially echodense consistent
with the presence of blood and/or partial organization. No
mitral respirophasic variation seen (limited views). The right
ventricle may be compressed - clinical correlation recommended.


[**2195-4-14**] CXR
Compared with [**2195-4-12**], the left pleural effusion may be somewhat
decreased. There has been partial re-expansion of the
atelectasis at the left base medially. There is minor
atelectasis at the right lung base.

[**2195-4-8**] CT Chest
1. Left-sided opacity on recent portable chest x-ray is shown to
be predominantly due to atelectasis of the lingula and left
lower lobe, although moderate left pericardial effusion
accumulating preferentially on the left side also contributes to
this appearance. There is only a small left pleural effusion.
2. Peristernal, retrosternal and pericardial fluid and gas,
probably postoperative in etiology, although infection is not
excluded considering the time interval since surgery; clinical
correlation suggested.
3. Small dependent right pleural effusion with adjacent
atelectasis.
4. Diffuse severe tracheobronchomalacia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 5784**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2195-4-4**] via transfer from
the [**Hospital3 2576**] [**Hospital3 **] for further management of his pleural
and pericardial effusions. Diuresis was initiated. An
echocardiogram was performed which showed  normal functioning
aortic and mitral bioprosthetic valves and a large pericardial
effusion. On [**2195-4-6**], Mr. [**Known lastname 5784**] was taken to the operating room
where he underwent a re-exploration with mediastinal washout and
clot evacuation. Postoperatively he was returned to the cardiac
surgical intensive care unit. He was slowly weaned form the vent
and extubated on [**2195-4-7**]. Anticoagulation was resumed for his
chronic atrial fibrillation. As his rate was somewhat rapid at
times, amiodarone was started for rate control with good effect.
Given his left pleural effusion continued to drain, the thoracic
surgery service was consulted for assistance in his care. A
chest CT scan was obtained which showed small bilateral pleural
effusions and normal postoperative changes. He remained in the
CSRU given his slowly improving  respiratory status. On [**2195-4-13**],
Mr. [**Known lastname 5784**] was well enough to transfer to the step down unit for
further recovery. He continued to be diuresed and
anticoagulated. The physical therapy service worked with him
daily. His foley was removed and he developed hematuria and a
3way foley was reinserted and a [**Doctor Last Name **] drip was started.
On [**4-15**] the foley irrigant was stoppped, urine remained clear
and on [**4-15**] @MN the foley was removed. He voided appropriately.
On [**2195-4-16**] it was decided he was stable and ready for discharge
to rehabilitation at [**Hospital1 **] Rehabilitaion Center.
