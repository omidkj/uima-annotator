Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3624**]
Chief Complaint:
Abnormal labs


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
64y.o. male with Hx of sCHF (EF 50%), ESRD [**3-5**]
glomerulonephritis s/p cadaveric renal transplant ([**2102**]),
complicated by acute humoral rejection in [**12/2121**](s/p IVIg and
plasmapharesis, rituximab x 1), DM, HTN, h/o MI presenting to
the ED at the request of his PCP due to abnormal laboratory
data.  Patient has been in his usual state of health when he
went for a follow up visit with his PCP.  [**Name Initial (NameIs) 2094**] 2-3 weeks prior
to presentation, he mentioned having some increased fatigue,
which prompted his PCP to check [**Name Initial (PRE) **] CBC and basic
electrolyte/liver tests.  He had his lab draws today which
showed an electrolyte abnormalities including
hyperkalemia/hyperphosphatemia and elevated creatinine.  He was
contact[**Name (NI) **] by his PCP to report to the emergency room for further
evaluation. Of note, patient mentions he took us usual long
acting insulin the night prior to presentation, but the morning
of presentation did not take his usual sliding scale insulin as
his glucometer was broken.  He did take his usual oral
hypoglycemics.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 100.0 HR 70 BP 138/54 RR 18
satting 98% on RA.  On presentation, fingersticks were
critically high.  ABG was performed which showed pH of 7.36/pCO2
34/pO2 78/ HCO3 20.  UA showed glucosuria, some protein, but
otherwise no signs of infection.  Lactate was low at 1.4.  CMP
was abnormal with glucose of 652, sodium of 128 (corrected to
135), potassium of 5.9 (baseline [**5-7**]), phosphorus of 4.9,
creatinine of 2.8 (has fluctuated 2.1 - 2.6 in last several
months) Lipase of  of 78 (fluctuates 60's to 150's), HCT of 27.5
(around baseline), WBC of 5.4 (baseline) and AST/ALT of 51 and
41 respectively (baseline in the teens to 20's).  CXR was
noncontributory, and renal ultrasound showed increase RI with
compromised diastolic flow, most notable in the lower pole
region, but stable compared to [**Month (only) 404**]. EKG was consistent with
prior, with sinus rhythm of 67, first degree AV block, TWI in
III/V1, and q waves in inferior leads c/w prior MI.  He received
10 units of IV insulin and was started on an insulin gtt at
8u/hour.  Vitals prior to transfer were afebrile/stable.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient is AOX3, feels well without
complaint.

IMAGING:

PA AND LATERAL VIES OF THE CHEST: Lungs are clear.
Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is unremarkable. No pleural effusions or
pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of cardiopulmonary process.

# RENAL TRANSPLANT U.S. Study Date of [**2122-6-3**]
FINDINGS: The right lower quadrant transplant kidney measures
14.1 cm. There is preserved corticomedullary differentiation
with no hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection. A small
echogenic focus is again seen in the upper pole.

COLOR DOPPLER SPECTRAL ANALYSIS: The main renal artery and main
renal vein are patent with normal waveforms. Resistive indices
are mildly increased at 0.87 to 0.89 in the upper, mid and lower
pole of the interlobar arteries.  There again appears to be a
lack of diastolic flow in the mid to lower pole, unchanged from
the prior examination.

IMPRESSION: Increased resistive index is with compromised
diastolic flow most notably in the lower pole region but stable
exam compared to the [**2122-2-1**].


Brief Hospital Course:
