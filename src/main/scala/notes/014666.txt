Chief Complaint:
seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD

Intubation


History of Present Illness:
58 yo f w/ h/o DM1, htn, hyperlipidemia, who was found down at
home by her son at approximately 3am. The patient was noted to
be convulsing at that time. It is unclear how long the patient
had been seizing for but was last seen 1d PTA at approximately
1pm. By report the patient had previously been well, but was
feeling somewhat lethargic yesterday. Patients son reports that
she has otherwise been well. Also states that he believes that
she has been stretching her insulin doses since she lost her
Mass Health. Reports that she developed DKA on multiple
occasions in this setting.
.
In the ED, the patient was found to be in sustained convulsion
w/ R eye deviation, broke w/ ativan 2mg x2. Noted to be febrile
to 102.6 and hypertensive to 226/12. Given labetolol x1. Further
assessment revealed bs to 700s and anion gap of 29. Started on
an insulin drip with improvement in AG.
.
LP was performed, positive for leukocytosis and patient was
given ceftriaxone, vancomycin, dexamethasone, and acyclovir to
cover empirically for meningitis. Gram stain neg.
.
Upon arrival in the MICU, the patient is intubated and sedated
with propofol, with EEG leads attached

[**12-20**] CXR: Endotracheal tube terminating in the right main
bronchus 2 cm below the carina. No consolidation or effusion in
the lung.
.
[**12-20**] head CT:
HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Comparison was made with a prior head
CT dated
[**2154-4-11**].  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage.  There
is no mass effect.  No shift of normally midline structure is
noted.  The appearance of the brain is unchanged since the prior
study, and there are multiple hypodensities in the basal ganglia
representing chronic lacunar infarct. There is mucosal
thickening in ethmoid sinus and right maxillary sinus, with
densely calcified cystic lesion as noted previously, now filled
with secretions, not significantly changed from [**2148-2-28**]. This
likely relates to chronic sinusitis.  The osseous structures are
otherwise unremarkable. Unchanged appearance of the brain
without acute intracranial hemorrhage. Densely calcified cystic
lesion in the right maxillary sinus, now opacified with mucus.
.
Carotid US: Bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis
.
EEG [**12-22**]:
ROUTINE TIME SAMPLING: Showed a very low voltage background with

occasional bursts of generalized slowing and some faster
frequencies,
also generalized. Much of the background was very supressed and
slow.
There were no prominent focal features, and there were no
epileptiform
abnormalities.
SLEEP: No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: Showed some artifact and occasional
sharp
features but no definite epileptiform abnormality.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There are 2 entries in these files.
They
showed some minimally rhythmic slowing but no epileptiform
activity.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were none.
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
The
background rhythm remained supressed throughout, often
correlated with
use of substantially sedating medications. There were still some

cortical rhythms. There were no prominent focal features
although
encephalopathies and medication effect can obscure focal
findings.
There were no epileptiform features or electrographic features.
.
MRI Head [**12-21**]:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Several areas of slow diffusion could be due to small
subacute infarcts in the left cerebral hemisphere.
2.  Increased signal along the sulci predominantly in the
parieto- occipital region indicates increased protein content of
the CSF and could be related to meningitis.  Clinical
correlation recommended.
.
MRV OF THE HEAD:
Head MRV demonstrates normal flow signal in the superior
sagittal and
transverse sinuses as well as in the deep venous system.
IMPRESSION:  Normal MRV of the head.
.
MRI/MRA Head [**12-24**]:
FINDINGS:
There is much more extensive restricted diffusion involving the
cortex of the left cerebral hemisphere than on the study of
three days previously.  There is extensive involvement of the
frontal and parietal cortex with some involvement of the insula
as well.  The abnormalities extend to involve the posterior
surface of the occipital lobe, which can be occasionally
supplied by the MCA. There is probably some medial occipital
involvement as well suggesting PCA territory involvement.  There
is also involvement of the deep left frontal white matter near
the caudate nucleus, as seen previously.
.
There are several small areas of relatively increased signal in
the right
cerebral hemisphere, on the diffusion-weighted images, which
might be
artifactual.  Currently the FLAIR images show FLAIR
hyperintensity in the
involved cortex and white matter but no increased signal and
subarachnoid
hemorrhage to suggest increased protein.
.
As seen previously, there is an old left putaminal hemorrhage
with associated hemosiderin.  There is old infarct in the left
corona radiata.  There is no mass effect on the ventricular
system or midline structures.
.
IMPRESSION:  There is extensive primarily cortical infarct
within the left MCA territory.  As discussed above, there is
involvement of least portions of the occipital lobe, perhaps
also supplied by the MCA in this patient as opposed to
representing a PCA territory infarct.  There are questionable
right cerebral abnormalities.
.
MRA OF THE HEAD.
The distal left internal carotid artery is widely patent.  The
proximal left MCA remains normal and unchanged from [**2151-9-15**].
Currently there is more extensive visualization of distal left
MCA branches than right, suggesting luxury perfusion.  The left
PCA originates from the basilar artery and is symmetric with the
right and normal in appearance.  The ACAs remain normal. There
is some irregularity of the right MCA proximally and distally,
which could be artifactual or perhaps related to mild
atherosclerosis.  This questionable finding was not present
previously.  The opacification of the paranasal sinuses has
improved slightly compared to the prior study.
.
IMPRESSION:  There is no evidence of intracranial left internal
carotid artery or left MCA stenosis.  The left MCA is unusually
well seen distally, and quite asymmetric
