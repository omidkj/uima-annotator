Service:  SURGERY/PURPLE

PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86-year-old male who was
admitted on [**2169-10-18**] with a chief complaint of abdominal
pain resulting from cholangitis.  The patient was transferred
from an outside hospital for ERCP.  The patient has a history
of peptic ulcer disease, status post a Billroth II,
gallstones, hypertension, dementia, CVA and asthma, and
presents as a transfer for ERCP to treat cholangitis.

The patient developed abdominal pain a few days prior to
admission and had a presyncopal event soon after eating
lunch.  He was brought to the Emergency Department and found
to have a temperature of 103, as well as elevated LFTs,
including total and direct bilirubin.  Ultrasound of his
gallbladder and liver showed a dilated intra and extrahepatic
biliary tree with choledocholithiasis.  The common bile duct
was 12 mm.  Apparently, he was admitted to the ICU and
treated with IV fluids and antibiotics.  He was transferred
here for ERCP, but they were unable to reach the major
papilla.  The plan was to do a percutaneous transhepatic
cholangiogram the day after his admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hypertension.
2. Dementia.
3. CVA.
4. Left carotid endarterectomy.
5. Peptic ulcer disease, status post Billroth II.
6. Asthma.
7. Status post TURP.
8. Possible congestive heart failure.

ALLERGIES:  NKDA.

MEDS:
1. Altace:  [**10-1**].
2. Aricept:  5 q hs.
3. Aspirin:  325 qd.
4. Lopressor:  25 [**Hospital1 **].
5. Hydrochlorothiazide:  25 qd.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature 98.5, pulse 84, blood pressure
146/78, respirations 20, 94% on room air.
GENERAL:  NAD.
LUNGS:  Markedly decreased breath sounds throughout with mild
hyperresonance.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs,
rubs or gallops.
ABDOMEN:  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, no right
upper quadrant pain.

RELEVANT LABS:  White blood cells 11.1, hematocrit 34.7,
platelets 122, sodium 138, potassium 3.4, chloride 104,
bicarbonate 24, BUN 25, creatinine 1.7, glucose 142, AST 156,
ALT 155, alk phos 340, total bili 9.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  An ERCP was attempted on [**2169-10-18**], but
was unsuccessful secondary to an inability to cannulate the
major papilla, which was thought to be because of a prior
Billroth II operation.  On [**2169-10-19**], the patient underwent
a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram and several stones
were removed from the common bile duct, and a PTC drain was
placed.  The patient clinically improved with a decrease in
his total bili from 9.1 down to 3.4.  Repeat PTC showed some
retained stones, but without adequate anesthesia they were
not removed.

During this time, the patient was also noted to have some
wheezing which required inhalers, and the patient's
creatinine remained elevated, and it was determined that the
patient had chronic renal insufficiency based upon
discussions with his primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 21067**] of an
ongoing elevation of the patient's white blood cells and
total bilirubin, and the continued finding of stones in the
common bile duct, a surgery consult was requested for a
possible cholecystectomy and common bile duct exploration.
At that time, the patient's white blood cell count was 12.1,
and the total bili remained elevated at 2.8.

The patient was then evaluated for cardiac risk and found to
have a 70% stenosis of his left anterior descending artery.
The echo showed some left ventricular wall thickening, but
systolic function was normal.  There was also mild aortic
regurgitation seen and pulmonary artery hypertension.  It was
decided that the patient would be a reasonable risk for
surgery without the repair of the left anterior descending
stenosis, since repair would necessarily involve
postoperative anticoagulation that would be inconsistent with
the cholecystectomy and common bile duct exploration.  The
patient was, therefore, scheduled for the next available OR
slot.

However, while the patient was still in the hospital, his
condition worsened with increasing right upper quadrant pain.
The patient was, therefore, taken to the OR on [**2169-10-30**] for
a common bile duct exploration, rigid choledochoscopy,
cholangiography and cholecystectomy.  Intraop, three common
duct stones were found ranging in size from 0.5-1 cm.  The
common bile duct was dilated to 2.5 cm.  There was a small
less than 1 cc pus pocket noticed intraop.  A T-tube was
placed in the common bile duct.  Please see dictated op note
for further details.

Postoperatively, the patient remained intubated for 12 hours
and was admitted to the ICU for close cardiac monitoring.
The patient's subsequent course was uneventful except for
continuing hypertension with systolic blood pressure ranging
in the 160s-180s.  A cardiology consult was obtained, and
they recommended increasing his dose of metoprolol and his
dose of Altace.  The patient's right upper quadrant pain also
resolved postop.  By postop day #3, the patient was walking,
eating, urinating on his own, and his pain was
well-controlled.  However, the patient continued to be
dependent on nursing care and was, therefore, deemed a
suitable candidate for a rehab facility.
