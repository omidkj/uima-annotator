Chief Complaint:
mid sternal chest pressure associated with SOB at rest, relieved
with NTG

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2122-11-3**] - CABGx3 (LIMA-->LAD, SVG-->OM, SVG-->RCA), AVR (21mm
CE pericardial model 2800)
[**2122-11-2**] - Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
70 year old white female with extensive cardiac history, EF
<20%, past MI's, several RCA PCI's, including rotational
atherectomy/PTCA/stenting of proximal and mid RCA in [**2-21**], HTN,
hyperlipidemia, PVD, Type II DM, presented to osh ER on [**2122-10-30**]
with c/o recurrent angina.  States had mid-sternal chest "heavy
pressure" associated with SOB at rest.  Took NTG SL and pain
resloved however recurred and she went to ER.  Denies
diaphoresis, N/V, palpitations, lightheadedness, PND, orthopnea.
 Patient ruled out for MI by enzymes.  ECG showed anterolateral
ST depression.  She was placed on NTG gtt primarily for BP
control.  She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
cath(results below).Referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for AVR/CABG.

Past Medical History:
1. CAD. Cardiac cath in [**2117**] with 80% proximal RCA lesion,
50-60% distal RCA lesion, 50% OM and a 40% distal LM/PLAD
lesion. S/p PTCA and stent placement to the proximal RCA.
Cardiac cath [**2118**]: RCA had an ostial 30-40% stenosis and mild
30-40% diffuse in-stent restenosis. EF of 60%. Cardiac cath
[**2121-12-26**], with 30% instent restenosis in the previously placed
RCA stent, and 95% mid vessel stenosis. PTCA with Cypher stent
placement performed, with 10% residual stenosis.
2. CHF, last EF 60% in [**2118**]. Recent ECHO showed her EF to be
40%.
3. Hypothyroidism
4. Diabetes mellitus type 2
5. COPD

7. elev. chol
8. prior GI bleed on ASA/plavix

[**2122-11-2**] Cardiac Catheterization
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant
system demonstrated severe two (2) vessel coronary artery
disease.
Specifically the left main was heavily calcified and
demonstrated
diffuse disease with a 80% ostial lesion that extended into the
Aorta.
The Left circumflex demonstrated mild illuminal irregularites
throughout
the vessel with no flow limiting lesions.  The LAD also
demonstrated
only minor illuminal irregularities.  The RCA was diffusely
diseased
throughout the vessel with extensive in-stent restenosis with an
80%
ostial lesion and a 90% mid vessel lesion.
2.  LV ventriculography was deferred.
3.  Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated an elevated
central aortic
pressure.

[**2122-11-10**] CXR
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are increasing in size. In
addition, there is moderate-to-severe bilateral atelectasis.
Pneumonia as an explanation for increasing left lower lobe
opacity cannot be excluded. The heart is normal size, the
mediastinal caliber is within normal limits, and there is no
evidence for pulmonary edema. Right IJ catheter tip projects
over the SVC and pacemaker leads course their anticipated paths.
Median sternotomy wires identified. No pneumothoraces.

[**2122-11-3**] Carotid Series
Moderate plaque with bilateral 40%-59% carotid stenosis. Of
note, on the left vertebral artery, there is increase in
velocity, which is consistent with some intrinsic disease.

[**2122-11-2**] ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. LV systolic function appears mildly to
moderately depressed. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities
include inferior and inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be
excluded.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2122-2-27**], the
left ventricle now appears less dilated and left vnetricualr
systolic function appears less depressed. Mitral regurgitation
is now less prominent.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2122-11-2**] for further
management of her chest pain. She was taken to the
catheterization lab where she was found to have an 80% stenosed
left main coronary artery and a 90% in-stent stenosed right
coronary artery. Given the severity of her disease, the cardiac
surgical service was consulted for surgical revascularization.
She was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a
carotid duplex ultrasound which revealed moderate plaque with
bilateral 40%-59% carotid stenosis. An echocardiogram was
performed which revealed 1+ aortic regurgitation, 1+ mitral
regurgitation and an ejection fraction of 40-45%.

On [**2122-11-3**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room. An
intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram revealed severe
aortic stenosis and EF 30-35% thus she underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting to three vessels and an aortic valve replacement
using a 21mm [**Last Name (un) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial model 2800
bioprosthesis. Postoperatively she was taken to the cardiac
surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. On  postoperative
day one, she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. The
electrophysiology service was consulted for interrogation of her
internal cardiac defibrillator and some changes were made to the
atrial and ventricular output. Beta blockade and aspirin were
resumed. She was gently diuresed towards his preoperative
weight. As she was anemic postoperatively, she was transfused
with packed red blood cells. Her oxygen requirements remained
high given her COPD however slowly improved over time. On
postoperative day seven, she was transferred to the step down
unit for further recovery. The physical therapy service was
consulted to assist with her postoperative strength and
mobility. Her oxygen saturations improved to 93% on a nasal
canula. Her creatinine rose to 2.0 on POD #10 and her lasix was
decreased to 20 mg qd. She continued to be monitored on the
floor and awaits tranfer to rehab. (stopped [**11-13**]).
