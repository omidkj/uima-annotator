This discharge summary dictation will cover the portion of
the patient's hospitalization from his admission on
[**4-1**], [**2153**], up until [**2154-4-19**].  As I am going off
service as of [**2154-4-19**], a subsequent discharge summary
dictation will cover the remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
course including discharge diagnoses, discharge condition,
and discharge medications, and followup.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  (per admitting senior
resident, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]):  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79-year-old
man with a history of alcohol abuse, who was brought to the
emergency department by his son, who found the patient on the
floor of his apartment on the morning of presentation.  The
patient's son reported that the patient's mental status was
not at baseline.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] generally consumes a large
quantity of alcohol (greater than ?????? of a pint per day) per
his son, but stopped drinking approximately four days prior
to presentation due to a death in the family.  According to
the patient's son, Mr. [**Known lastname **] has never had any withdrawal
seizures or hallucinations nor any delirium tremens; however,
he has not stopped alcohol frequently.

Mr. [**Known lastname 35443**] son stated that on the evening prior to admission,
the patient was not "completely making sense," as the patient
was making references to people who were not present.
Mr.  [**Known lastname **], upon presentation, does not recall falling, but
was found down next to his bed by his son on the morning of
presentation, still exhibiting some mental status changes.

The patient's only recent medical problem prior to
presentation was gout times several weeks. (The patient was
taking an herbal medicine from [**State 3908**].  The patient and the
son do not know the name).  Otherwise, the patient denied
chest pain, chest pressure, and shortness of breath.  He
admitted occasional dry cough, but denied fevers, chills,
dysuria, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and lower
extremity edema.  The patient had been taking less p.o. fluid
since discontinuing alcohol.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  The patient has a sporadic and infrequent history of
followup with the primary care physicians.  He recently
changed primary care physicians to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3510**].  The patient
has poor recall regarding his medical history.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Gout.
4.  Alcohol abuse, as described above.
5.  History of several inpatient hospitalizations related to
alcohol abuse, according to his son.
6.  History of "renal impairment," per the patient and his
son.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Famotidine b.i.d.
2.  Herbal medication noted in the history of the present
illness, type unknown.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a longstanding history of
alcohol abuse as noted above.  The patient's son reported
that it may have been possible that the patient drank
moonshine in his youth, when he was growing up in [**State 9512**].
The patient quit cigarettes 30 years ago.  The patient lives
alone.  His son lives in an apartment above him.  The
patient's son is very involved in the patient's care.  The
patient had worked in managing a fence-building business.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on presentation revealed
the following:  (per admitting senior resident, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]:
Temperature 98.7, heart rate 122, blood pressure 111/72,
respirations 18, saturating 98% on room air.  GENERAL:   The
patient is a pleasant thin man in no acute distress.  HEENT:
PERRLA, no jaundice or icterus.  Oropharynx moist.  NECK:
Supple, without lymphadenopathy.  Neck veins flat.  CARDIAC:
Regular rhythm, tachycardia; no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  ABDOMEN:  Soft,
nontender, positive bowel sounds.  Liver edge palpable
approximately 4 cm below the costal margin.  EXTREMITIES:
1+  pitting edema at the right pretibial level; no edema on
left, positive warmth on the right, especially at the right
first metatarsophalangeal joint with some erythema and
minimal tenderness in this area.  NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient
was alert and oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II
through XII intact with some decreased hearing in the left
ear, which is chronic according to the patient.  Normal
sensation to light touch in all four extremities.  Strength:
[**3-24**] bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on presentation:  CBC
revealed the white count of 7.4, hematocrit 31.6, MCV 103,
platelet count 109,000.  Chem 7:  Sodium 137, potassium 3.7,
chloride 95, bicarbonate 22, BUN 40, creatinine 4.0, glucose
108.  Coagulation studies revealed PT of 13.0, PTT 26.5, INR
1.2.  Urinalysis revealed moderate blood, low protein, one
red blood cell, three white blood cells, moderate bacteria,
two epithelial cells.  LFTs revealed ALT of 8, AST 35,
alkaline phosphatase of 111, total bilirubin 1.1, lipase 21,
CK 147 with troponin of less than 0.3, CKMB 3.

Head CT performed in the emergency department revealed
generalized atrophy; there was no evidence of bleed, shift,
or cerebral edema.  Renal ultrasound performed in the
emergency department revealed bilateral small echogenic
kidneys consistent with chronic medical renal disease.
Specifically, the right kidney measured 8.7 in the long axis
while the left kidney measured 8.2 cm long in the long axis.
There was no hydronephrosis, evidence of stones, or masses in
the kidneys bilaterally.  Chest x-ray revealed the heart to
be normal in size with the lungs demonstrating no focal
opacifications, CHF, or pleural abnormalities.  There was
slight prominence of the mediastinum with contours
bilaterally.  The osseous structures were normal.

EKG revealed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 110; axis was
normal as were intervals.  There was early R-wave
progression, without ST or T abnormalities.  No prior study
was available for comparison.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As the patient has been hospitalized for
nearly three weeks now, the following summary will address
the patient's major medical issues by system and problem:
However, given the patient's extensive hospitalization, as
well as his numerous medical problems, it is suggested that
the reader peruse the patient's CCC records as well for any
further details that may be desired.

ISSUES:

MENTAL STATUS:  As noted above, the patient has a
longstanding history of alcohol abuse; approximately four
days prior to presentation, the patient reportedly stopped
drinking.  The patient was fairly alert and oriented on
initial presentation, although the patient's son had noted
that the patient had been acting strangely and somewhat
disoriented on the evening prior to and the morning of
presentation.  On the morning following admission, the
patient exhibited significant agitation and disorientation.
Additionally, he exhibited tremulousness.  The patient had
been started on IV fluids, thiamine, and vitamins following
admission.  Given his above noted agitation, disorientation,
and tremulousness, the patient was started on Ativan p.r.n.
by CIWA scale.  The patient was felt to have exhibited these
withdrawal-like symptoms for the following three to four days
after admission.  The psychiatric service was consulted
regarding the patient's presentation and condition with
regard to his alcohol withdrawal and mental status changes.
Ultimately, the patient's Ativan was discontinued, and he was
later put on p.r.n. Haldol for agitation.  The Haldol, as
well, was discontinued, subsequent to this and currently the
patient is not on any Haldol or Ativan.

Currently, the patient remains disoriented and perhaps
delirious.  The exact etiology of his mental status changes
remains unclear.  His mental status has waxed and waned
intermittently throughout his hospitalization and it is felt
by the primary consulting teams to be multifactorial in
etiology.

In terms of working up the etiology of the patient's mental
status changes, he has had an exhaustive workup for
infectious
