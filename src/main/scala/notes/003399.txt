the asc aorta. There is a segmental dissection falp in the
posterior aorta. A
bicuspid valve was also noted. Cardiac surgery was consulted for
surgical correction.

Pertinent Results:
[**2105-1-19**] Cardiac Cath
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated no angiographically apparent flow-limiting coronary
disease.  The LMCA, LAD, and LCx had no obstructive disease.
The RCA was not selectively engaged, however aortogram
demonstrated no angiographically apparent flow-limiting disease.

2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a wide pulse pressure
with an
SBP of 125mmHg and a DBP of 51mmHg.
3.  Aortogram demonstrated a dilated aortic root and significant
aortic
regurgitation.

[**2105-1-20**] ECHO
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
A tiny patent foramen ovale is present.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 40 - 45 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is severely dilated. A mobile density is
seen in the ascending aorta consistent with an intimal
flap/aortic dissection. Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is
seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is a small pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
The patient is AV-Paced, on an infusion of epinephrine.
There is a prosthetic aortic valve in place with no leak and no
AI.
Residual mean gradient = 5 mmHg.
Trace MR, no TR.
RV systolic fxn is preserved.
The inferior wall of the LV is akinetic. Overall systolic fxn is
reduced mildly further from pre-bypass.
There is a tube graft replacing the ascending aorta. The
descending aorta is intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 91790**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2105-1-18**] for further
management of his bicuspid aortic valve insufficiency and aortic
aneurysm. He was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. A
cardiac catheterization was performed which revealed no
significant coronary artery disease. A dental consult was
obtained and he was cleared for surgery after having panorex
films of his teeth. On [**2105-1-20**], Mr. [**Known lastname 91790**] was taken to the
operating room where he underwent a bentall procedure using a
27mm On-X mechanical valve. CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS TIME:165
minutes.CROSS-CLAMP TIME:  133 minutes.CIRCULATORY ARREST TIME:
17 minutes. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. Over the next several hours he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. On postoperative day one, he was
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. Coumadin
and heparin were started for anticoagulation for his mechanical
on-x valve. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative
weight. The physical therapy service was consulted for
assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. The
remainder of his hospital course was essentially uneventful. By
post-operative day #6 his INR was therapeutic and he was ready
for discharge to home.  All follow-up appointments were advised.
