Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer for radiation oncology evaluation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation
PICC placement
[**2112-11-21**] tracheostomy, PEG, thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
55 yo female with history of tobacco abuse and chronic back pain
transferred from [**Hospital6 33**] for Oncology and Radiation
Oncology evaluation.  The patient initially presented to [**Hospital 7912**] on [**2112-11-5**] following an evaluation by ENT for
sinus congestion.  Per the patient's family, she had been
complaining of upper respiratory symptoms including nasal
congestion, drainage, cough for approximately 2 months.  She had
been evaluated in [**State 108**] by her PCP and ENT.  She was treated
with antibiotics and antihistamines without relief.  She came to
[**Location (un) 86**] to visit her family for [**Holiday 1451**].  Her daughter was
concerned with facial and neck swelling.  She noticed that her
neck veins were engorged.  Her daughter referred her to her own
ENT who ordered a CT chest to evaluate for SVC syndrome.  The CT
showed RUL and RML collapse due to a central obstructing lesion
as well as bulky lymphadenopathy.

The patient was referred to the [**Hospital3 **] ED, and admitted for
malignancy evaluation.  On admission she had a thoracentesis
which did not show evidence of malignancy.  She was transferred
to the ICU on [**2112-11-6**] for respiratory decompensation.  On
[**2112-11-8**], thoracic surgery performed a rigid bronchoscopy with
biopsy which showed non-small cell lung cancer.  The patient was
intubated initially for this procedure, extubated, but then
developed respiratory failure 20 min later requiring
reintubation.  She self extubated on [**2112-11-9**], was in respiratory
extremis and required reintubation.  The patient was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  Her sedation medications have
included propofol, precedex, fentanyl and ativan.

On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient is intubated and sedated.
The patient's husband, daughter and son are present.  They are
concerned for her comfort.  They feel she has been very
uncomfortable on the ventilator, without adequate sedation.
They report she has chronic severe back pain from scoliosis
which is likely contributing to her discomfort.

Unable to obtain review of systems secondary to intubation.

Past Medical History:
Non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed [**10-17**], SVC syndrome
Scoliosis, chronic back pain
s/p cholecystectomy
s/p hysterectomy


Social History:
The patient lives in [**State 108**] with her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] daughter and
son are very supportive and live here in Mass.  She has smoked a
pack of cigarettes per day since she was 18 years old (37 pack
year history).  Denies alcohol or illicit drug use.

Pertinent Results:
From [**Hospital6 33**]
CT Chest [**2112-11-2**]:  RUL and RML collapse, central obstructing
mass, large right pleural effusion, bulky right paratracheal,
subcarinal, precarinal and lateral vascular adenopathy.

MRI head [**2112-11-6**]:  Nonspecific small foci of increased T2 and
Flair signal in the subcortical white matter likely represent
small vessel ischemic change.  No mass or metastatic disease.

CT Abd/pelvis [**2112-11-6**]:  Large right pleural effusion,
compressive atelecatsis, no liver lesions, no abdominal mass or
adenopathy, 3mm right renal calculus, edema in the subcutaneous
fat of the anterior chest wall as well as the right and left
breast.  no pelvic mass


Brief Hospital Course:
#.  Respiratory Failure:  She was intubated at an OSH for
respiratory distress.  She had a high a-A gradient throughout
admission that was felt to be secondary to shunt physiology with
collapse of her right upper and right middle lobe.  She had an
initial bronchoscopy the day after admission which showed a
large tumor burden obstructing the airways.  She had a stent
placed by IP on [**11-13**] to the right main stem bronchus to prevent
further collapse.  She then had a tracheostomy/PEG placed on
[**11-21**] as well as a thoracentesis of 1.2 L of pleural fluid.  The
fluid was negative for malignant cells.  On [**2112-11-22**], she was
liberated from the ventilator but required further ventilatory
support overnight on several instances.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] continued to
do well, spending most of her time on trache-mask.  Repeat CXR
showed slow reaccumulation of pleural effusion, but her
respiratory function remained stable with attempts to diurese
her further.  If her respiratory function acutely worsens, would
consider CXR to assess fluid status, diuresis with prn lasix
and/or thoracentesis to drain pleural fluid.  She also likely
may require ventilatory support to rest overnight occasionally.
She was on this at discharge at night.  Her settings were Volume
Control TV 450, RR 16, PEEP 5, Fi02 50%.

#.  Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer:  This was a new diagnosis
immediately prior to admission.  Radiation oncology was
consulted.  She completed 4 doses of palliative XRT (400 cGy x 5
fractions) which was completed [**11-16**].  Medical oncology was
consulted as well and offered chemotherapy as a possible option
for the future.  Initial metastatic workup has been negative
with negative abdominal and brain imaging.  She was followed by
palliative care.

#.  SVC Syndrome:  She initiallly presented to the OSH with
facial swelling secondary to SVC sydrome due to her lung mass
and bulky lymphadenopathy.  She was started on IV steroids which
were tapered gradually.  She was also started on a Heparin gtt
due to an SVC and IVC clot which was transitioned to Lovenox on
[**11-22**].  Her neck and facial swelling worsened from [**Date range (1) 84136**],
and she was restarted on dexamethasone 4 mg [**Hospital1 **] with a plan to
slowly taper down to a low dose (4 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 2 days then decrease
to 2 mg [**Hospital1 **] (on [**12-1**]) and assess response.  If pt continues to
have better controlled edema and no vomiting, it can eventually
be decreased to 2 mg qd.  If she has more symptoms may need to
go up on dose to 2 mg tid or 4 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Goal is smallest dose
possible to keep symptoms under control and to allow of increase
in dose if symptoms reoccur.

#.  Bleeding: On [**11-23**], she had an episode of bleeding from her
PEG tube, increasing abdominal pain, and a hematocrit drop.  She
was given a total of 2 units of blood and her bleeding stopped.
Her anticoagulation was initially held.  GI did an endoscopy on
[**11-25**] and found an ulcer which was injected with epinephrine and
her hematocrit remained stable, although dropped slightly (2
points of the day of discharge).  Her hematocrit should be
checked daily for 2-3 days to ensure stability after discharge.

#.  Chronic Back pain:  She has chronic pain secondary to
scoliosis.  She was continued on fentanyl initially and was
transitioned to Dilaudid IV as needed however this caused
delerium so she was changed back to oxycodone on [**11-26**].  She was
also started on Methadone, but felt that this precipitated
nausea and made her somnolent.  Consequently, she was changed to
oxycodone 30mg PGT q4 standing, with oxycodone 30-60 mg PGT q2
prn.  The patient was o
