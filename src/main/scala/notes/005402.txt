History of Present Illness:
72-year-old morbidly obese woman with a history of thyroid
cancer and atrial fibrillation who recently underwent a
colonoscopy by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1940**] here at [**Hospital1 827**].  The patient notes that on [**5-9**] she had a
colonoscopy and a few days after that she developed severe
right-sided pelvic and abdominal pain.  This basically passed
over the course of two days, but she saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1940**] in followup
for this.  It was not associated with fever, vomiting, change in
bowel habits.  A CT scan was obtained on [**5-23**].  This
revealed a 15 cm right adnexal lesion, which appeared to have
"increased in size in comparison to a [**Hospital1 18**] MRI dated [**2099-11-26**]
and findings most consistent with ? fibroid versus ovarian
fibroma.  The mass is inseparable on imaging studies from the
sigmoid colon and cecum.  Also noted was a calcified thrombosed
aneurysm of the GDA and likely second aneurysm within the left
upper abdomen.  She is here for discussion of treatment options.
[**Known firstname **] has had additional imaging studies and brings with her
today a MRI from [**Location (un) 1121**] Imaging.  She has been followed by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for this problem in the past and has basically been
observed during this time period.  [**Known firstname **] has been reluctant
to undergo surgery for this mass in the past.

The patient was seen for follow up visit on [**2107-6-15**]. She
returned after having had a MRI to evaluate her pelvic mass at
an outside institution.  She had a repeat of her MRI performed
once again at [**Location (un) 1121**] Imaging and this revealed, as
expected, a slight enlargement of the large 15-17 cm right
adnexal mass.  It is unclear once again whether this is a
fibroid or a tumor of the ovary.  She also had noted on her CT
scan an abnormality to the blood supply within the celiac axis.
She has undergone an MRA and this reveals significant
stenosis of the proximal celiac artery.  There are also dilated
anterior and posterior pancreaticoduodenal arteries with
aneurysmal dilations and collaterals in the root of the
mesentery adjacent the SMA.  A renal lesion was also identified
and was advised for evaluation in six months for a pre and post
contrast renal MRI.  Also noted was a 3-mm cystic lesion in the
pancreatic
body.  This could also be followed in six months. The patient
was recommended to have a preoperative evaluation.

The patient had several follow up visits between [**5-/2108**] and
03/[**2107**]. She returned on [**2108-2-8**] for a followup evaluation.
In the interim time period, the patient had elected to proceed
with surgery but unfortunately fell and had a urinary tract
infection as well as pneumonia.  She was admitted here to the
hospital.  We had to delay her surgery. Post-hospitalization
followup chest x-rays have been done.  Her most recent was on
[**2-6**] and this reveals little change from her prior chest x-ray,
which shows "improved but not complete resolution of a right
middle lobe pneumonia," followup is recommended.

Past Medical History:
The patient has a history of fib, morbid obesity, and thyroid
cancer, which appears to be under control and without evidence
of recurrence.  She denies history of hypertension, mitral valve
prolapse, asthma, or thromboembolic disorder.  She is up-to-date
with respect to mammography and colonoscopy.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She had an appendectomy in [**2080**], ovarian
cystectomy and fibroidectomy also in [**2080**].  This was evidently a
partial thyroidectomy.

OB/GYN HISTORY:  Her last menstrual cycle was 30 years ago.  She
denies postmenopausal bleeding.  She denies any history of
fibroids, cysts, pelvic infections or abnormal Pap smears.  On
further review, we discussed the fact that the pelvic masses may
in fact be a fibroid.  She has had this for "for a number of
years."  She reports she has never been pregnant.

Social History:
She denies tobacco or drug use.  She is an association
executive.


Family History:
She reports a cousin both had breast cancer. She denies any
family history of thromboembolic disorder.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies fever, weight change, or
weakness. HEENT:  Denies headache, visual or hearing changes,
epistaxis, dysphasia. Cardiovascular:  Denies chest pain,
palpitations, or orthopnea.  Respirations:  Denies cough,
dyspnea, or hemoptysis.  GI:  Denies abdominal pain, anorexia,
nausea, vomiting.  She denies constipation, diarrhea or melena.
GU: Denies dysuria or frequency.  She denies hematuria or
abnormal vaginal bleeding.
Neuro:  Denies syncope, paresthesia, or muscle weakness.
Hematologic:  Denies fatigue, petechia, or spontaneous bleeding.

Physical Exam:
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  The patient appears in no apparent distress.  She
appears her stated age.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Oral mucosa without evidence
of thrush or mucositis.  Eyes, sclerae are anicteric.
NECK:  Supple.  No masses, no palpable thyromegaly identified:
Lymph node survey, negative cervical, supraclavicular, axillary,
or inguinal adenopathy, however, her exam is limited due to
adiposity.
CHEST:  Lungs clear bilaterally.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  I do not appreciate a murmur
today.
BACK:  No spinal or CVAT tenderness.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, no apparent distention.  A large
vertical midline incision is noted to extend from the umbilicus
down.  The pannus is without any evidence of edema or
irregularity.
EXTREMITIES:  There is no clubbing or cyanosis.  There is edema
of bilaterally, 1+ to 2+ of the lower extremities.  The inner
thigh show evidence of a previous operation, which the patient
relates was resection of fatty tissue.
PELVIC:  Normal external genitalia.  The inner labia minora is
normal.  Urethral meatus is normal.  The speculum is placed and
a normal cervix is identified.  Bimanual exam reveals a fairly
mobile uterus.  The pelvic mass on the right side is very
difficult to palpate due to the patient's morbid obesity.  I do
not palpate any mass on the the left side.  There is a fullness
appreciated on the right side only.  A rectal exam reveals good
sphincter tone without mass or lesion.
