Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
ventricular fibrillation arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
arterial line placement
intubation

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is an 85M with a history of a-fib (on home Coumadin) and
idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, who presented to [**Hospital3 **]
[**Hospital 6136**] Hospital s/p ventricular fibrillation arrest. He
collapsed in his house and had been down for 2 minutes when EMS
arrived. He was received 120J Biphasic and amiodarone 150mg IV
followed by continuous infusion by EMS for presumed V fib/VT and
subsequently arrived at [**Hospital 15405**]. Cooling protocol was initiated
sometime between presentation at [**Hospital3 15402**] ~ 7:30 AM, then was
MedFlighted to [**Hospital1 18**]. He had reached 89F by presentation to
[**Hospital1 18**] at 10:30 AM on [**2191-12-12**].

[**Name (NI) **] wife reports that patient came from bathroom this AM
at 7AM and lied down. His wife tried to talk to him, but he was
unresponsive. She contact[**Name (NI) **] EMS ~ 5 minutes afterwards, and EMS
arrived in 2 minutes. They felt rhythm was ventricular
fibrillation, and he received 1 shock and revereted to a narrow
complex rhythm. On presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, patient had been
intubated and cooled to 89 degrees Fahrenheit. He received
Vecuronium IV and was started on fentanyl and midazolam for
sedation. On arrival to CCU, vital signs were 52, 218/109, T:33
Celsius, O2 Sat 100% on 100% FiO2. He was transiently on a
nitroglycerin gtt which was turned off once patient became
hypotensive to 70s systolic, and pressure returned to 130s
systolic. He was experiencing several runs of wide-complex
tachycardia, appearing monomorphic on telemetry, and received
another 150mg IV amiodarone.

Unable to perform review of systems, as patient is sedated.

MICROBIOLOGY

RADIOLOGY:
CT Head ([**12-14**]):
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema or mass.
.
CT Head ([**12-15**]):
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, or
herniation.

.
MRI Head ([**12-15**]): IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality. Evaluation of
the
posterior right parietal lobe is obscured by metallic artifact.

2. Small vessel ischemic disease.

Echo [**2191-12-13**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal akinesis of the
inferior and inferolateral walls and hypokinesis of the distal
inferior septum. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. Triival pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. Elevated left
ventricular filling pressures. Mild aortic regurgitation.   EF
30-35%

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Mr [**Known lastname **] is an 85M with HTN, HL, non-obstructive CAD,
a-fib (on home Coumadin), dilated cardiomyopathy (ischemic vs
idiopathic, LVEF 25%), COPD, who presented s/p VF arrest at
home.

# V fib arrest: Unclear etiology, though likely [**12-19**] idiopathic
dilated cardiomyopathy. No evidence for acute ischemic process,
cardiac enzymes elevated in setting of recent defibrillation.
Patient underwent arctic Sun cooling protocol for
neuroprotection, then was rewarmed. He was intubated on transfer
to [**Hospital1 18**] and was admitted to the CCU. TTE showed EF 30-35% with
regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD. He was
place on aspirin. His Coumadin was held initially for elevated
INR then restarted. He was monitored on tele and was in afib.

# Seizure: Patient developed seizures after rewarming, neurology
was consulted. 24-hour EEG monitoring was initiated. Placed on
Ativan gtt and valproic acid initially, but added propofol for
frequent seizures. Likely in setting of anoxic brain injury s/p
cardiac arrest (unclear time before pt was resuscitated),
however, MRI head [**12-15**] was not confirmatory. In the morning of
[**12-15**] was noted to have unequal pupils and given manitol and sent
for emergent head CT to r/o herniation, which was negative.  Pt
continued to have seizure activity while on propofol- valporic
acid was started then Keppra. Patient was unresponsive and
continued to have abnormal pupils. Extensive discussion was had
with patient??????s wife expressing pt's likely poor outcome, pt was
made DNR/DNI.

# Rhythm - slow AFib w PVCs. Pt started on BB for rate control,
but stopped due to bradycardia likely CNS origin. Bradycardia
worsened after starting propofol and valproic acid, HR in
40s-50s.

# Elevated INR ??????  No known liver disease/nutritional deficiency.
LFTs downtrending.
Complete DIC labs neg. Concerned regarding gut function, got 1mg
IV vitamin K [**12-14**]

# HTN  - BP was very labile, initially hypertensive. Transiently
used nitro gtt, then labetalol gtt. Then on [**12-16**] became
hypotensive and required levo gtt to maintain pressure. Once pt
was [**Month/Year (2) 3225**] levo was stopped and p
