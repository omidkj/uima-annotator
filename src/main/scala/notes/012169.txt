Service:  [**Location (un) 259**] GENERAL MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 80-year-old man
with a past medical history of coronary artery disease,
polymyalgia rheumatica who presents from outside hospital
with episode of chest discomfort and shortness of breath.  He
was in his usual state of health until one week prior to
admission when he began having worsening shortness of breath
and dyspnea on exertion while on vacation at [**State 8842**].  He had
worsening shortness of breath on the day prior to admission,
an episode of chest pain and went to the Emergency Department
at an outside hospital in [**Hospital3 **].

He had electrocardiogram changes which were nonspecific,
possible ST elevation on lead 1 and L, T-wave inversion in 3
and was ruled out for myocardial infarction with CKs and
troponin.  Originally started on Aggrastat and heparin which
was discontinued on [**3-24**].  He was continued on beta blocker
and aspirin, started on an ACE inhibitor and Plavix and
received diuresis with intravenous Lasix.  He was transferred
to [**Hospital6 256**] and at presentation
he was with shortness of breath which was improved.  No chest
pain, no fevers, chills, nausea or vomiting, however he did
have a cough productive of brown sputum.

1.  Coronary artery disease, status post cardiac
catheterization many years prior notable for 80% right
coronary artery stenosis treated medically.
2.  Prostate cancer three years prior to admission treated
with radiation.
3.  Polymyalgia rheumatica, treated with prednisone from
[**July 2172**] and [**2173-3-27**]
4.  HCS
5.  Status post appendectomy
6.  Diverticulosis, status post resection
7.  Spinal stenosis

FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works as a banker.  He has a 15
pack year smoking history, but quit 40 years ago.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature was 97.9??????, blood pressure 108/58,
pulse 90, respirations 20.  O2 saturation is 95% on 4 liters.
GENERAL:  He is a pleasant man in no acute distress.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Anicteric.  Oropharynx is
clear.  Jugular venous pressure is 3 cm.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2.  The patient also
has an S3.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.
CHEST:  Bibasilar wet crackles at the bases bilaterally one
half up.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, active bowel sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  No edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Warm extremities.
NEUROLOGIC:  Alert and oriented x3, mentating well.

ADMISSION LABS:  Notable for CKs 45, 29 and 27, troponin less
than 0.10 x2 and less than 0.15.  White blood count was 13.1,
hematocrit 35, platelets 378.  Chem-7 146, 4.3, 109, 20, 27,
1.1 and 168.  His coagulation studies were normal.  Chest
x-ray showed multiple patchy bilateral opacities in the mid
and lower lobes, partially obscuring the mediastinal and
hilar contours.  No preliminary vascular engorgements.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1.  PULMONARY:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was aggressively diuresed with
Lasix, as it was felt that he had pulmonary edema.  His
oxygen saturation did not improve with his diuresis, in fact
it gradually worsened prompting a chest CT scan on [**3-30**]
which revealed diffuse air space disease predominantly of the
mid and lower lung zones consistent with infectious or
inflammatory process that were groundless opacities
bilaterally.  He therefore had multiple serologies checked
and a biopsy done through a VATS procedure on [**2176-3-31**].  The
serologies were notable for positive P-ANCA confirmed by
myeloperoxidase and positive rheumatoid factor and an
elevated ESR, otherwise negative.

He had had the biopsy which revealed acute and organizing
pneumonitis with interalveolar fibrin deposition and type II
pneumocyte hyperplasia, fresh and organizing vascular
thrombi, but no evidence of active vasculitis.  Stains were
negative for evidence of infection.  Around this time on [**3-30**], he had been transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit because of worsening respiratory status and intubated.
He was started on Cytoxan and Solu-Medrol and improved
respiratory wise over the next few weeks.  He was extubated
on [**2176-4-12**] and his sedation was gradually titrated.
Pulmonary wise, he remained stable, but still had an oxygen
requirement on the date of discharge at approximately 2 to 3
liters nasal cannula.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient presented and was ruled out
for myocardial infarction.  The initial feeling was that he
had pulmonary edema from congestive heart failure, however
his echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricular
ejection fraction.  No significant valvular disease and no
evidence of pericardial effusion or tamponade.  Therefore,
the aggressive Lasix diuresis was stopped and he was simply
continued on aspirin, Lasix 40 mg intravenous qd, amlodipine,
metoprolol and Isordil.  His Lipitor had been stopped because
of elevated CKs and his ACE inhibitor had been stopped
because of his renal function.  He did not have any chest
pain or new electrocardiogram changes during his hospital
course and telemetry was discontinued when he left the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.

3.  RENAL:  The patient developed renal insufficiency which
was believed to be secondary to the aggressive diuresis he
received upon admission and his BUN increased into the 100s
and his creatinine increased to a maximum of 3.7 on [**4-12**].  It
had improved back to 2.2.  His urinalysis was noted for muddy
brown casts.  His FENA was 5% and SPAP and UPAP were
negative.  His GBM was also negative.  It was felt that he
probably did not have vasculitis infecting his kidneys and
that it was probably simply acute tubular necrosis.  His
renal function had improved by the time of discharge to a
creatinine of 1.4.

4.  MUSCULOSKELETAL:  When the patient had reversal of his
sedation, it was noted that he was diffusely weak.  This
delayed his extubation for a few days.  When he was finally
extubated, he had difficulty talking.  He had difficulty
moving his head and difficulty moving his extremities.  The
neurology and rheumatology services were consulted for this
weakness and after thorough investigation including EMG nerve
conduction studies and a muscle biopsy, the belief was that
this was secondary to a steroid myelopathy or a critical
illness myopathy believed to improve with time and weaning of
his steroids.  His strength gradually improved since transfer
to the floor and currently he has 3+ strength in his fingers
and hands, 3+ strength in his toes and feet and 1+ to 2+
strength in the rest of his extremities.  He has 3+ strength
in his neck muscles.  His extraocular movements are intact.
His LDH and CK had been followed for evidence of muscle
injury and they had been increasing and now are decreasing.
His LDH is currently 363 and his CK is 291 on the date of
discharge.

5.  HEME:  His hematocrit has remained relatively stable
during this admission.  He has no current active bleeding.

6.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  He is currently not on any
antibiotics and has not shown any recent evidence of
infection.

7.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient was
having issues with hypernatremia and received D5 water
various times during his admission and free water boluses
through his tube.  Because of this and his sodium had
improved to 148 on the day of admission, his feeding was done
through his nasogastric tube initially and he had a G-tube
placed through interventional radiology and the nasogastric
tube was removed.  His G-tube has been functioning well with
low residuals and he has been getting Ultracal tube feeds.

DISCHARGE PLAN:  The plan is to discharge on the following
medications.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Cyclophosphamide 120 mg per G-tube qd
2.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous [**Hospital1 **]
3.  Furosemide 40 mg intravenous qd
4.  Prednisone 80 mg per G-tube q od x2 weeks, then 70 mg po
q
