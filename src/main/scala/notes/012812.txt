Brief Hospital Course:
A: 78 yoF admitted with fever, hypotension, hydronephrosis, and
UTI
.
P:
1) Septic shock: The pt was admitted with physiology c/w septic
shock. At the time, the most likely source was felt to be
urinary, given admit U/A demonstrating a high number of WBCs,
RBCs and few bacteria. The differntial of possible sources
included bacteremia (potential seeded sites include back from
recent lumbar surgery) vs pneumonia (?LLL infiltrate on CXR).
The patient did not have meningismus to suggest meningitis.
Although patient had gauiac positive stool and RLQ pain, no
evidence on OSH CT scan to suggest acute intra-abdominal process
other than hydronephrosis. The pt was initially covered
empirically with ceftriaxone and azithromycin to cover UTI and
possible pneumonia. Sputum cultures demonstrated no growth and
CXR did not show any infiltrate c/w pna. Though subsequent urine
cxs showed no growth, given admit u/a pt was covered for
urosepsis on 14 day course of levofloxacin.
.
The pt was bolused as needed for goal CVP 8-10; goal UOP 30
cc/hr, goal MAP >65. and was eventually weaned off levophed.
.
The pt's septic picture resolved for several days but the pt was
having difficulty being weaned off the vent. It was unclear why
the pt was having difficulty beign weaned off the vent. CXRs
demonstrated effusions but no focal opacities that may have
contributed to. The pt began spiking temps and again became
hypotensive with low CVPs suggestive of septic shop. She was
treated with fluids and levophed with goals as above. Despite
continued, negative films, a CT chest on [**7-27**] demonstrated new
multi-focal upper lobe opacities.
.
The pt was intially treated with a course of vanc and zosyn, but
was transitioned to meropenem. The pt was again weaned off
pressors and her septic picture resolved.
.
2) Respiratory failure--Pt initially intubated due to mental
status changes/inability to protect airway. The pt's oxygenation
and ventilatory status were well-controlled on the ventilator.
After treating pt's initial sepsis, weaning from the vent was
difficult [**2-4**] to the pt's evolving PNA. Tracheostomy was
postponed as the pt began spiking fevers as described above.
Since she was unable to be weaned from the ventilator, she
underwent successful tracheostomy on hosipital day 18.  A
brochoscopy was performed and lavage fluid grew out HSV.  She
was started on acyclovir for a 10 day course.
.
3) ARF: The pt's renal failure was felt to be [**2-4**] to
hypovolemia/septic shock. Throughout the admission the pt's
creatinine trended down. There was a brief period, during her
second septic picture (related to pna) when her creatinine again
rose slightly, but following treatment it again trended down.
.
4) Anemia: The pt initially presented with a low Hct. DIC and Fe
studies did not demonstrate underlying pethology/deficiency. Her
Hct drop was felt to be [**2-4**] to large volume resuscitation. The
pt's Hct rose and then sstabilized at >30.  During her hospital
course, her hematocrit ranged between 25-30.  She received 4
pRBC transfusions.
.
5) HTN: Her outpatient Toprol XL, Ramipril, and Maxzide were
initially held given the pt's presenting hypotension.
Metoprolol was started once she was no longer hypotensive and
this was titrated to 50 mg po tid.
.
6) Hypothyroidism: Her home levothyroxine had not been continued
through the admission.  It was restarted on the day of
discharge.
.
7) Type II DM: She intially required an insulin drip to maintain
blood glucose control and was transition to a sliding scale.
Her NPH dose was titrated up to achieve adequate glycemic
control.
.
8) F/E/N: Following extended intubation pt placed on TFs via OG
tube. A PEG was placed on [**7-31**] and the pt's TFs were continued.
Her electrolytes were repleted.  Her sodium increases toward the
end of her admission.  She was given free water via her PEG tube
to correct her hypernatremia.
.
9) Ppx: She had pneumoboots, subcutaneous heparin, and a PPI
throughout the admission.
