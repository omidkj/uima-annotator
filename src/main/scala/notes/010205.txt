Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 76-year-old gentleman had
known aortic stenosis and was referred for cardiac
catheterization because of progressive symptoms.  He had been
diagnosed with aortic stenosis in the early [**2107**] and
severity had been followed over the years with
echocardiograms.  He had a cardiac catheterization at [**Location (un) **] [**Hospital **] Hospital in [**2125-3-11**] which also
revealed clean coronaries, with an ejection fraction of 65%,
and moderate aortic stenosis.  He had been very active in the
past, but he has recently had decreased exercise tolerance
and progressive shortness of breath. He was referred in for
cardiac catheterization at the medical center.

Prior to his admission on [**3-8**], he had an
echocardiogram done which showed an normal ejection fraction,
mild-to-moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy,
left ventricular diastolic reduced, and aortic sclerosis,
severe aortic stenosis, and mild mitral regurgitation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Past medical history includes)
1.  Aortic stenosis.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Gout.
5.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
6.  Polio.
7.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  (Past surgical history includes)
1.  Hernia repair times two.
2.  Transurethral resection of prostate.
3.  Right carotid endarterectomy in [**2128-6-8**].

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Prior to admission he was on
aspirin, Accupril, Sectral, Pravachol, Prilosec, Klor-con,
and Procardia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On examination by the
cardiothoracic resident, his lungs were clear.  His heart was
regular in rate and rhythm with a normal first heart sound
and second heart sound.  His abdomen was soft and nontender
with bowel sounds.  He had reasonable veins in his
extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  His preoperative
laboratories showed a white blood cell count of 8.7,
hematocrit of 40, platelet count of 321,000.  Sodium 142,
potassium 4.7, chloride 106, bicarbonate 27, blood urea
nitrogen 24, and creatinine of 1.2.  His INR was also 1.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  He came in for cardiac catheterization
which was performed on [**3-8**] in preparation for his
valve surgery which showed an ejection fraction of 67%,
aortic stenosis, and normal coronary arteries.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   He was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] of
Cardiothoracic Surgery who noted his history, and his very
tight aortic stenosis, and preserved left ventricular
function and was consented for aortic valve replacement.

On [**3-10**], he underwent aortic valve replacement with a
21-mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] bioprosthetic valve through
minimally invasive approach. The patient had some
difficulties in the operating room prior to leaving, had an
intra-aortic balloon pump placed, and was started on an
epinephrine drip, and went to the unit on an epinephrine drip
and a propofol drip, in stable condition despite some
critical time in the operating room.

On postoperative day one, the patient remained A-paced at
80s, balloon was on 1:1 and was weaned to 1:2 over the course
of the day.  He remained intubated and sedated.  His heart
was regular in rate and rhythm.  His abdomen was benign, and
he had increased breath sounds on the right.  His white blood
cell count was 14.2, with a hematocrit of 25.7
postoperatively.  His postoperative blood urea nitrogen
was 22, with a creatinine of 1.

The plan was to try and wean his epinephrine down as his
balloon was being weaned, and he was started on captopril for
afterload reduction and continued on his perioperative
antibiotics.  He was seen by Case Management and was
initially consulted by Physical Therapy.

The patient also got a bronchoscopy by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14968**] which showed
minimal-to-moderate thickened white secretions on the right
side greater than the left.

On postoperative day two, he was transfused 1 unit of packed
red blood cells and his cardiac index dropped, and the
patient was started on dobutamine.  At this point, he was on
a levofloxacin drip, Flagyl, albuterol, Zantac, captopril,
hydralazine, as well as some of his oral medications.
Temperature maximum was 102.6.  He was also started on some
amiodarone.  His dobutamine was at 5, his insulin drip was
at 2.  By the time of examination, his Neo-Synephrine had
been off two hours.  The balloon was at 1:1 initially.  His
hematocrit dropped to 21.1, for which he did receive a
transfusion.  He remained intubated and sedated.  Balloon
remained in.  He was switched over to synchronized
intermittent mandatory ventilation.  He continued on his
dobutamine and was transfused.

Cultures were sent, and he remained on his levofloxacin and
Flagyl antibiotics.

On postoperative day three, he required increased MA on his
pacer and [**Hospital1 1516**] pads were placed.  He remained on his
levofloxacin and Flagyl as well as amiodarone, nitroglycerin
at 0.5, dobutamine at 5, propofol at 50, and his balloon
remained at 1:1.  He remained arteriovenous paced at
approximately 77 with a temperature maximum of 101.1.  His
blood pressure was 114/52, with a central venous pressure
of 13.  He had an output of 3.8, with an index of 1.9.  His
mixed venous was 60%.  His hematocrit came back up to 24.9,
and his white blood cell count decreased to 11.1.  Blood urea
nitrogen and creatinine remained stable.  He remained
intubated and sedated and continued on his perioperative
antibiotics while cultures were pending.

On [**3-13**], he was also seen by Electrophysiology fellow
who was called emergently to place a temporary pacing wire.
He had an episode of complete heart block with no escape.  He
was paced with [**Hospital1 1516**] pads that had been placed and now had an
escape junctional rhythm.  Consultation was done by
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 8797**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 41703**].  Please refer to her note in the
chart.  The patient did remain intubated and sedated and was
somewhat rhonchorous, maintaining a good blood pressure of
107/58 on dobutamine at 5, amiodarone at 0.5, and
nitroglycerin drip.  It was commented on by Electrophysiology
that the patient had probably suffered a myocardial
infarction on the prior day (on the same day that he had the
episode of complete heart block).  They recommended
re-bolusing the patient with amiodarone and changing his
drip, and getting thyroid and liver studies, and they made
recommendations for his pacemaker, and discussed his care
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] who was the attending.

His first creatine phosphokinase was 4614, the second was
3308, and the third was 2461.  Attending cardiologist also
recommended getting a transthoracic echocardiogram.  A
transthoracic echocardiogram was not obtained as the patient
had a transesophageal echocardiogram over the weekend which
showed a depressed inferior wall and a valve that was
functioning well and seeded well.

On postoperative day four, the patient remained on an
amiodarone drip at 1, dobutamine at 5, propofol at 30,
continued on levofloxacin and Flagyl, continued on
hydralazine and captopril for afterload reduction.  His wires
were not capturing which had resulted in him getting a
transvenous pacemaker.  On postoperative day four, his white
blood cell count was 14.8, with a temperature of 100.4.  His
hematocrit was 28.9, with a platelet count of 128,000, a
potassium of 4.3.  His lactate was 1.4.  He was
hemodynamically stable at that point with a blood pressure
of 123/54, and remained V-paced at 80.  He removed all four
extremities to pain stimuli and remained intubated and
somewhat sedated.  His lungs were clear bilaterally, and the
rest of his examination was benign.  He was started on tube
feeds as tolerated and continued on his perioperative
antibiotics.  He was seen again by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who recommended
continuing the amiodarone and considering another
transesophageal echocardiogram.  He was also followed that
day
