Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2610**]
Chief Complaint:
cough, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
86F with h/o CHF and recent admission [**Date range (1) 7039**] for PNA, who
presents from her [**Hospital3 **] facility with worsening cough
for a few days. The cough was non-productive and she had no
associated fevers, but she did reports some chills and runny
nose. She also endorses dysuria. Two days ago, her daughter and
HCP [**Known firstname **] had a conversation with pt's VNA, who reported that
the patient had more difficulty breathing. [**Doctor First Name **] visited
yesterday and was concerned about her mother's labored breathing
and cough. This morning a separate daughter [**Name (NI) 17804**] went to see
[**Name (NI) **] and brought her into the ED.
.
In the ED, VS were: T 100.3 (rectal) SBP: 120s, HR: 80-120
(afib), noted to be tachypneic and hypoxic to 92%RA. On exam she
had diffuse rales and rhonchi. A CXR was obtained that showed
PNA as well as likely CHF. Blood cultures were drawn and she
received vanc and cefepime (H/O MRSA). An EKG showed afib with
no ischemia and CE's were negative, but she was also given ASA.
While in the ED she complained of back pain and received
morphine and zofran. She then developed respiratory distress and
her sats then dropped into 80s on nasal cannula. In the setting
of respiratory distress, she became agitated and hypertensive.
She was tried on BIPAP but did not tolerate this, and so was
placed on a NRB. She became hypertensive to the 200s, and a
nitro gtt was started. She then became hypotensive to SBP 70s,
and this persisted even while off the nitro gtt, so peripheral
neosynephrine was started. A discussion occurred between the ED
staff and daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **] (HCP) and son who is back-up HCP,
and pt was confirmed as DNR/DNI, no central lines. Family
understood that pressors could only be continued for max of 24
hours via peripheral route, and understood. Last set of VS prior
to transfer to MICU were: 99.5 80 112/45 18 100% NRB.
.
Currently she appears comfortable and is not in any acute
respiratory distress.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2183-9-21**]  12:03:06 PM

Sinus tachycardia. The P-R interval is prolonged at 220
milliseconds. Atrial ectopy. Left axis deviation. There is a
late transition which is probably normal. Compared to the
previous tracing the rate is faster and ectopic beats are new.
.
[**2183-9-21**] CXR
CHEST, SINGLE VIEW: There is persistent cardiomegaly.
Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. There is
multifocal airspace opacification involving the right lower
lobe, left upper lobe, and to a lesser extent the right upper
lobe. There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no
pneumothorax. Osseous structures are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Multifocal airspace opacification could represent
asymmetric
pulmonary edema from heart failure, multifocal pneumonia, or
aspiration.
.
[**2183-9-26**] PA&lat
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
pre-existing
parenchymal opacities have clearly decreased in extent. There
are remnant
opacities at the bases of the right upper lobe, the retrocardiac
lung areas, and the right lung base. Bilaterally, there might
also be a minimal pleural effusion. No newly occurred focal
parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia. Multiple healed rib
fractures. Moderate cardiac enlargement
without signs of overhydration. Extensive degenerative changes
in the right shoulder.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Healthcare-associated pneumonia: The patient was begun on
vancomycin and cefepime for HCAP coverage. The patient had a
fever on hospital day 4 and cefepime was changed to meropenem.
Urinary legionella antigen was negative. Blood cultures have not
grown to date. She subsequently improved subjectively, with
resolution of fever and improvement in oxygen requirement. She
will complete a 14-day course of antibiotics (vancomycin through
[**10-4**] and meropenem through [**10-7**]).
.
#Acute on Chronic Diastolic CHF: The patient was treated with
diuretics with improvement in her symptoms and oxygenation.
Lisinopril and metoprolol were given for afterload reduction.
She will be discharged on lasix 10 mg daily, with instructions
to check daily weights and up
