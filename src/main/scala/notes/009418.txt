This Discharge Summary covers time in Cardiac Care Unit.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72 year old
male with multiple medical problems including coronary artery
disease, congestive heart failure, status post coronary
artery bypass graft, pacer placement, status post myocardial
infarction, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and Alzheimer's
Disease, who is admitted to the hospital on [**1-19**], for
cardiac catheterization to evaluate for revascularization.

According to the patient's wife, the patient's functional
status has been declining since [**2189-3-31**].  He has had
multiple hospitalizations since [**Month (only) 116**] for increasing shortness
of breath, renal failure, hyponatremia, and complications
secondary to transurethral resection of the prostate.  His
most recent hospitalization for congestive heart failure was
two weeks ago after he was found on the floor by his wife.
[**Name (NI) 3003**] to that, he had been admitted with confusion and
agitation on [**12-15**].  Mr. [**Known lastname 31317**] requires complete
assistance with his activities of daily living.  His
shortness of breath has been progressively worsening over the
last few months.  He now becomes dyspneic when walking 20
feet and can hardly walk one to two steps.  He has orthopnea
and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and nocturia at baseline.

Additionally, he has had generalized weakness and lower
extremity edema as well as poor wound healing in his lower
extremities.  The patient has also complained of anorexia
that has progressively worsened over the last month.

The patient has had episodes of urinary retention and
incontinence since his transurethral resection of the
prostate.  Mr. [**Known lastname 31317**] has baseline Alzheimer's Disease and
per his wife, has had progressive worsening in his memory of
late.

1.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2176**]; status post myocardial infarction in

anterior descending, SVG to right coronary artery and SVG to
left circumflex.  The patient is also status post myocardial
infarction in [**2183**].  Most recent echocardiogram in [**5-/2189**],

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 72 year old male with
congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease,
Alzheimer's Disease, who was admitted with worsening
shortness of breath and planned cardiac catheterization.

1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was continued on Bumex and
Aldactone in order to decrease preload and his
catheterization was put on hold until his INR had decreased.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**1-21**] which
demonstrated severely elevated right and left sided filling
pressures, moderate pulmonary hypertension, as well as severe
three-vessel coronary artery disease with vein grafts
revealing a patent left internal mammary artery to diagonal,
and patent SVG to obtuse marginal but a diseased SVG to the
left anterior descending and diseased SVG to the right
coronary artery.  The patient's pressures included a wedge of
29, RA-pressure mean 25, PA-pressure 52/27; RV pressure
50/14.  Cardiac output 5.5 with a cardiac index of 2.49, that
improved to a cardiac output of 8.13 and a cardiac index of
3.65 status post Dobutamine infusion during the
catheterization.

The patient was subsequently admitted to the Cardiac Care
Unit for hemodynamic monitoring and diuresis.

On admission to the Cardiac Care Unit, the patient had a
systolic blood pressure in the 100's, rate in the 70's, with
PA pressures 51 to 54 over 22 to 24 on a Dobutamine drip of 5
micrograms per kilogram per minute.  The initial plan on
admission to the Cardiac Care Unit was to avoid aggressive
diuresis immediately given that the patient had just
undergone a significant dye load during the catheterization.
Therefore, an effort was made to maintain the patient's fluid
status at even over the first night, to follow his creatinine
and then to begin aggressive diuresis as guided by Swan
catheterization measurements.

Ischemia:  The patient was found to have two out of four
bypass grafts which were diseased on catheterization.  The
patient was continued on aspirin therapy and there was a
suggestion of returning to catheterization for possible
intervention on these grafts should the patient's overall
cardiac status improve.

Pump:  The patient's blood pressure was maintained on the
Dobutamine drip, which was titrated as tolerated.  The
patient was also provided with Lasix p.r.n. in an effort to
bring down his elevated wedge pressures.  However, over the
first couple of hospital days, the patient was found to not
tolerate Dobutamine secondary to multiple premature
ventricular contractions on Telemetry.  Therefore, it was
decided to switch the patient to Milrinone with vasopressin
in addition as needed to maintain the patient's blood
pressure.  The initial goal PA diastolic was a pressure of 21
to 22.  However, over the first few hospital days, the
patient had extremely poor urinary output despite adequate
cardiac output by PA catheter measurements.  Once the patient
was found to not tolerate Dobutamine secondary to premature
ventricular contractions, he was switched to Milrinone and
Vasopressin which also could not be tolerated secondary to
extremely low blood pressures.

Therefore, on hospital day number four, the patient was
switched to Dopamine in an effort to maintain appropriate
cardiac output.

However, the patient's course was complicated by the
development of a Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and
subsequent sepsis, which played a significant role in the
patient's development of hypotension.  Therefore, the patient
had to be started on Vasopressin in an effort to maintain
adequate vasoconstriction in the setting of vaso-dilat
