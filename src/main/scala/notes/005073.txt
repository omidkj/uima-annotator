History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10840**] is a 72year old male, with multiple medical
problems, including duodenal resection for adenoidCA in the 4th
portion of his duodenum, in [**3-14**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He was noted
to have recurrence to mediastinal nodes [**2-14**]. He has two recent
admissions for signs of small bowel and billiary obstruction.
Which were treated and patient was most recently discharged on
[**2177-4-19**] to home as he had refused rehab. He was scheduled to
return to clinic for further chemotherapy, however developed
nausea, vomiting and lightheadedness the day after his
discharge. He had an episode of fall and presented to ED with
hypotension. Given his concerningly low blood pressure he was
admitted to the surgical ICU.  His surgical course prior to this
admission is as follows:
[**4-4**]: biliary cannulation not possible as D2 was infiltrated
with tumor. His ERCP was otherwise normal to D3.
[**4-7**] PTC report: External compression of the common hepatic duct
and distal CBD obstruction by duodenal mass. 8 Fr internal and
external drainage tube with its distal tip were positioned at
duodenal third portion.
[**4-8**]: UGI: irregular narrowing of 2nd part duodenum c/w recurrent
tumor
[**4-10**]: Biliary stent: internalized successfully with pigtail
passed and remaining through duodenal obstruction into the
jejunum
[**4-15**]: Cholangiogram: dilated hepatic ducts and patent biliary
drain with terminal pigtail distal to the area of obstruction
[**4-17**] IR metallic stents unsuccessful, still has PTC to gravity
drain

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, Mr. [**Known lastname 10840**] was readmitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] SICU for signs
of sepsis with increased WBC and hypotension.  He is a 72M who
is s/p (4th portion) for adenocarcinoid tumor (duodenal primary
w Lung Mets) and CCY [**3-14**].  He was previously admitted for tumor
recurrence in mediastinal nodes [**2-14**], and biliary obstruction.
During this last admission, to treat this obstruction, he
received a PTC, EGD with failed duodenal stent placement [**4-9**],
PTC internalization [**4-10**], 2 duodenal stents by GI [**4-14**], and failed
metallic stents by GI [**4-17**]. He was discharged after his diet was
advanced and he tolerated PO without any difficulty. However on
the day following his discharge he felt lightheaded and had an
experienced a fall due to weakness, without loosing
consciousness. He was brought to ED, and was found to be
hypotensive. He was transferred to SICU, where he temporally
required pressors ( no intubation) and was treated with multiple
antibiotics for sepsis, presuming his biliary system as the
source of infection. After patient was weaned off pressors, with
stable VS, he was transferred to OMED service for further
management. On the floor patient was intermittently hypotensive
with poor renal and liver function. BP as well as renal function
responded well to volume resuscitation, and during the course pt
was also found to have UTI. Given he already was on Cipro for
his presumed biliary infection, Zosyn was added, which led to a
decrease in pt's WBC and an overall clinical improvement.
Patient was started on chemotherapy on [**2177-5-3**]. Cisplatin was
given. On [**2177-5-4**] Patient presented with worsening cough and
abdominal pain, and later increasingly hypoxic with O2 sats low
80s, 92% on NRB. He subsequently developed worsening mental
status. CXR revealed total white out of left lung likely from
fluid and collapse. Pt was intubated and transferred to ICU. He
was started on three pressors with no improvement in his
hypotension as well as broad spectrum antibiotics. The patient
became increasingly more acidotic. Family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and
informed of his morbid state.  After discussion with his family,
the goals of care were transferred to focus on comfort measures.
 The patient passed away comfortably.

His hospital course is broken down by systems:

Neuro
His pain has been well controlled, however he developed new
abdominal tenderness prior to transfer to the ICU which was
treated with IV Dilaudid.

Cards
He transiently required the use of neosynephrine and levophed to
maintain his BP in the ICU, was completely weaned off pressors
as of [**4-25**], however was trans
