HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old
female with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with an
ejection fraction of 30% presenting with short of breath and
fatigue for two days.  She was noted to be in atrial flutter
with a heart rate in the 140s and blood pressure 69/42.  Her
baseline blood pressure is 80 systolic.  She is on a home
dopamine drip for the last 2.5 years.  Her dose has recently
been decreased because of her decreasing weight.  She reports
about a [**1-20**] pound weight loss over the past three weeks.  She
was also noted at [**Hospital3 628**] to have grossly
Guaiac-positive black stool, an INR of 13, and a hematocrit
of 21.  The patient denied any chest pain.  She reports
feeling some palpitations yesterday and also reports some
bilateral leg pains after walking around her house.  She has
also felt lightheaded for the past few days.  She denied any
falls or loss of consciousness.  She has had a recent
admission from [**2129-3-4**] to [**2129-3-5**] for PICC line replacement
and hypotension.  She denied any blood in her stool, although
has noted it to be black.  She denied nausea, vomiting, or
hematemesis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature afebrile,
heart rate 140s, blood pressure 80/palpable, respirations 15,
saturating 100% on 4 liters.  General:  The patient was in no
acute distress, alert and oriented times three.  HEENT:  The
mucous membranes were moist.  JVP at 10 cm.  [**Doctor Last Name **] A waves
present.  Cardiovascular;  Tachycardiac.  Mechanical S1.  No
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended,
normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Without edema.
Cool, trace dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  There were 2+
posterior tibial pulses bilaterally.  Lower extremity
hyperpigmentation consistent with venostasis.  Rectal:  Black
stool, Guaiac-positive.

LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 7.2, hematocrit
26.0, platelets 65,000.  INR 9.0.  Sodium 136, potassium 4.9,
chloride 103, bicarbonate 18, BUN 70, creatinine 1.8, glucose
67.  AST 29, ALT 34, alkaline phosphatase 82, total bilirubin
0.2, albumin 3.3, total protein 6.7.

EKG showed atrial tachycardia at a rate of 145, left bundle
branch block, T wave inversion in II, III, and aVF, V4
through V6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was in atrial tachycardia at a
rate of 146.  The patient was attempted to be overdrive paced
in the Emergency Department but unsuccessfully.  Her pacer
was interrogated and she was found to have one-to-one atrial
and ventricular conduction which was felt to be most
consistent with atrial tachycardia.  She was loaded on
Amiodarone during her first hospital stay and DC cardioverted
into a completely AV paced rhythm at a rate of 60.  She was
transfused 3 units of packed red blood cells on her first day
of admission for a hematocrit of 21 which bumped her
appropriately.  She continued to have black Guaiac-positive
stools during most of her hospital stay.

The Gastroenterology Service saw her in the hospital and will
either do an upper endoscopy here while she is an inpatient
and on heparin or she may have it done at a later time.

2.  GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED:  She has a history of upper GI
arteriovenous malformations.  She was transfused 3 units of
packed red blood cells on her first day and a total of 5
units overall.  Likely her GI bleed is in the setting of a
supratherapeutic INR and thrombocytopenia, both of which were
corrected during her hospital stay and her hematocrit
remained stable, although she will likely need follow-up
EGD/push enteroscopy if she does not have it during this
hospitalization.  She was continued on PPI b.i.d.  Her LFTs
were within normal limits.

3.  THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  The patient's course of
thrombocytopenia coincided with initiation of linezolid to
treat her Nocardia bacteremia.  Her linezolid was
subsequently discontinued and her Infectious Disease doctor,
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who follows her as an outpatient, was
consulted and involved in her care and changed this
medication to sulfadiazine.  After about three to four days,
her platelet count recovered from a nadir of about 43, most
consistent with bone marrow toxicity from linezolid.

4.  ISCHEMIC CARDIOMYOPATHY:  Her ejection fraction is
25-30%.  She is on a home dopamine drip at 8 at baseline.
She initially required a larger dose of dopamine at 10 and
has been titrated down to her home dose of 8 with good blood
pressure control with a systolic from 80-100s.  The patient
will continue on a 2 gram sodium diet, have daily weights.
Her carvedilol was held.  She continued Enalapril,
spironolactone, and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**], her outpatient cardiologist,
will see her in the morning.

5.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  Likely secondary to profound
hypotension when she was admitted Her ACE inhibitor was
initially held when she came in and her creatinine
subsequently improved.

6.  HISTORY OF SEPTIC PULMONARY EMBOLI SECONDARY TO LINE
INFECTION:  The patient has had this from a prior admission
from [**Month (only) 956**] of this year when blood cultures grew both
Nocardia and a gram-negative rod nonfermenter not further
identified.  She was initially on Bactrim high dose but did
not tolerate this and was changed to minocycline and
Ciprofloxacin but the sensitivities subsequently returned and
the organism was intermittently sensitive to minocycline so
she was changed to linezolid and Cipro for the last three
weeks but her linezolid was discontinued during this
admission as it has likely caused her thrombocytopenia.  She
was subsequently changed to sulfadiazine per her outpatient
Infectious Disease doctor, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

7.  DIABETES:  Diet-controlled at home.  She was continued on
sliding scale insulin while she was here.

8.  PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE:  The patient was with warm,
well-perfused lower extremities during her hospital stay.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient will likely be discharged to
home.

The patient's discharge follow-up plans and discharge
medications will be included in a further discharge summary
dictating the remainder of her hospital course.
