RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2161-4-1**] 1:44 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: evaluate mediastinum

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
79 year old man with s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate mediastinum
INDICATION: Status post CABG.

COMPARISON: [**2161-3-31**].

PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Median sternotomy wires, mediastinal
drain, left-sided chest tube, drain overlying the right
mediastinum, and left-sided central venous line appear in
unchanged position. There is interval removal of the Swan-Ganz
catheter. Patient has been extubated, and nasogastric tube has
been removed. Otherwise, no significant change when compared to
prior study. Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear stable.
Persistent retrocardiac opacity likely representing a
combination of atelectasis and effusion identified.

IMPRESSION: Postoperative changes as described. No significant
change aside from removal of supporting lines and tubes as
described, no significant change from prior.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Approved: [**Doctor First Name **] [**2161-4-2**] 8:29 AM

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is markedly dilated. Moderate to
severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left
atrial appendage. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial
septum is seen at rest. A small secundum atrial septal defect is
present. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. There are simple atheroma in the
ascending aorta. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

POST BYPASS
Left ventricular systolic function remains unchanged, with
persistent regional wall motion abnormalities visualized
prebypass. RV systolic function remains moderately impaired.
There is a well seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the
aortic position. No AI is visualized. Mitral regurgitation is
moderate (2+). Shunt across ASD remains left to right.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to cardiac surgery. He was started on IV
heparin. Dental consult recommended 1 tooth extraction. He was
seen by hematology for his CLL diagnosis and plan for follow up
with outpatient hematologist after discharge. Carotid u/s showed
right ICA 60-69%, left ICA 40-59%. On [**3-30**] he underwent tooth
extraction. On [**3-31**] he underwent an AVR, CABG x 3, and aortic
endarterectomy. He was extubated later that same day. He
initially had complete heart block which recovered to sinus
rhythm with 1 AVB and nonconducted PAC.  Chest tubes removed on
POD #1. He was transferred to the floor on POD #2. He was seen
by electrophysiology for continued AV block with non conducted
PAC. His beta blockers were discontinued with plan to follow up
as outpatient in [**12-10**] weeks with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] for rhythm evaluation.
Spoke with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**4-6**] at 1655.  He continued to progress
except for persistent left pleural effusion that was tapped [**4-7**]
with no complications.  He was ready for discharge home with
services post op day 7 with plan for follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
1 week.
