History of Present Illness:
48 M with a h/o HTN, hyperlipidemia, bicuspid aortic valve, and
tobacco abuse who was transferred from an OSH for further
management of CHF and severe aortic stenosis. Pt has a known h/o
bicuspid aortic valve. Did not seek medical care for the past
three years for his cardiac history. He presented to his
cardiologist on [**2148-10-1**] with progressive SOB and LE edema. He
was tried on BB but he did not tolerate [**12-30**] to weakness and SOB.
TTE in [**2144**] revealed a bicuspid aortic valve with moderate
aortic stenosis. He also had mild-to-moderate aortic root
dilatation and mild-to-moderate concentric LVH with normal EF.
Cardiac catheterization on [**2144-10-2**] which revealed mild AS, valve
area 2.1, normal coronaries, and normal LV function. He was then
lost to f/u, re-presented on [**2148-10-1**]. Most recent TTE revealed
severe aortic stenosis with worsening LV function. EF was 25%.
RV pressure was 41 and had biatrial enlargement. Noted to have
2+ aortic insufficiency with mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. He was sent home
from cardiology clinic with Lasix and BB (which he did not
tolerate), continued to have worsening SOB and LE edema, and
finally presented to the OSH for evaluation.

OSH course: He was admitted to the OSH on [**2148-10-10**] with CHF and
LE edema. CEs negative. D. dimer positive. Treated for ethanol
withdrawal with CIWA scale. TTE revealed severe aortic stenosis
with an EF of 25% with LV dilitation. The AM of transfer, he
developed acute respiratory distress with chest pain. He was
given Lasix 80 mg IV x 1, SL nitro x 2, and morphine. He was
transferred to the CCU on a 100%NRB. ABG was 7.55/20/172. He was
then intubated. Right IJ was placed. CXR confirmed placement per
OSH notes. I/O 120/360.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU, he was hemodynamically stable. He
then vomited (had no OG tube in place). He arrived with a R IJ
and on the ventilator. Family accompanied the pt who confirmed
the history.

Pertinent Results:
All urine, blood and sputum cultures without growth.

ECHO [**10-13**]: There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated with severe global free
wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. Significant
aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: severe global biventricular contractile dysfunction
with significant (possibly severe) aortic stenosis

ECHO [**10-14**]: Left ventricular hypertrophy with cavity dilation
and severe global hypokinesis. Severe aortic valve stenosis with
underlying bicuspid aortic valve. Dilated ascending aorta. Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

ABDOMINAL US [**10-13**]: 1. Gallbladder sludge. Mild gallbladder
distention without evidence of wall edema or pericholecystic
fluid. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. 2. Mildly
heterogeneous liver echotexture. This may be related to the
patient's underlying cardiac disease. 3. Right pleural effusion,
incompletely imaged.

HEAD CT [**10-20**]: No acute intracranial process.

CHEST CT [**10-24**]: Bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
atelectasis,
superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Left lower lobe
nodular opacity
versus infiltrate. Follow up is suggested. Cardiomegaly. Ectatic
ascending aorta measuring 4.4 cm. Ascites.

right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The

severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
