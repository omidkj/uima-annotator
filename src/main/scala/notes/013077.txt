History of Present Illness:
59M h/o coronary artery vasospasm, minimal CAD (Cath [**2176**]) S/P
ICD placement for VF arrest ([**2173**]) presented to [**Hospital 5871**] hospital
with SSCP.  His chest pain woke him from sleep at 2am, he walked
around and it did not resolve.  It was accompanied by sweating
and some SOB.  He went to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5871**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and was given NTG, his pain
did not resolve and he was transferred here for possible cardiac
catheterization.

A CXR at [**Location (un) 5871**] indicated a widened mediastinum, a CT to
evaluate for aortic disection was planned, but held due to a
Creatinine of 2.6.

Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**2180-11-25**]): Compared to prior study dated [**2180-11-20**], there
has been clearing at the left base. The retrocardiac area is
clearer and the left hemidiaphragm is now visualized. No acute
cardiopulmonary disease.

CXR ([**2180-11-8**]): Mild cardiomegaly with mild failure versus volume
overload. Left
lower lobe atelectasis.

CXR ([**2180-11-6**]): 1. Slight LV enlargement with minimal upper zone
redistribution. This could be due to slight residual left heart
failure. No significant infiltrates or
effusions are demonstrated.

CXR ([**2180-11-5**]): Apparent interval increase in size of cardiac
silhouette, but no
definite congestive heart failure. Dedicated PA and lateral
chest radiograph
would be helpful to more accurately assess the heart size, and
to determine
stability of tortuosity of the thoracic aorta, as well as to
better evaluate
a patchy opacity in the left infrahilar and retrocardiac
regions.

TTE ([**2180-11-13**]): IMPRESSION: Very mild regional left ventricular
hypokinesis.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2180-11-7**], the
findings are
similar.

TTE ([**2180-11-7**]): 1. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 2. The
aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. 3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. 4. Compared with the
findings of the prior report (tape unavailable for review) of
[**2180-11-6**], LV function appears normal.

TEE ([**2180-11-6**]): Overall left ventricular systolic function
appears depressed. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. No evidence of aortic dissection in the
ascending aorta, transverse arch or descending aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION
1. No evidence of aortic dissection in the ascending aorta,
transverse arch or descending aorta. 2. Left ventricular
systolic function appears depressed -suggest TTE to better
assess left ventricular function and wall motion 3. Mild Mitral
regurgitation. 4. Mild Aortic regurgitation.

REST MIBI ([**2180-11-6**]): No myocardial perfusion defects are
identified on the resting phase of a myocardial perfusion study.


Renal U/S ([**2180-11-14**]): Limited study. The kidneys are normal in
size and appearance, with normal arterial flow to both kidneys.
No definite evidence of renal artery stenosis. Ultrasound is not
a sensitive technique for evaluating renal artery stenosis.

EEG ([**2180-11-10**]) This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the
presence of both
independent [**2-11**] Hz delta frequency slowing over each hemisphere,

bitemporally, and bifrontally. The background rhythm was low
voltage and
generally slowed and there were also generalized bursts of delta

frequency slowing. These findings suggest deep, midline,
subcortical
dysfunction suggestive of an encephalopathy with propofol as a
possible
cause. After the propofol was discontinued, the delta and theta
frequency slowing occurred more frequently. No epilepitform
abnormalities were seen in the record. Note was made of sinus
tachycardia with ectopy on the cardiac monitor.

CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST ([**2180-11-14**]): The endotracheal tube ends
midway between the clavicles and carina. A nasogastric tube
descends into the stomach. A pacemaker is present in the left
anterior chest. A right subclavian central venous catheter ends
at the cavoatrial junction. Within the limits of a noncontrast
exam, the heart and great vessels are unremarkable. Several
small mediastinal lymph nodes are present, some of which have
fatty hila. None are large enough to meet the criteria for
pathologic enlargement. Calcified nodes are present at the left
hilum. There is no pericardial or pleural effusion. There is no
pneumothorax. Mild bilateral dependent atelectasis is present.
Consolidation with air bronchograms is present in the superior
segments of both lower lobes.  CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:
Within the limits of a noncontrast exam, the liver, gallbladder,
spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach and
intestines are unremarkable. There is no abnormal bowel wall
thickening or bowel loop dilatation. There is no free air or
ascites. There is no significant mesenteric or retroperitoneal
adenopathy.  CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: A Foley catheter is
present in the urinary bladder. A small amount of air within the
bladder is likely iatrogenic. The pelvic viscera are otherwise
unremarkable. No pelvic mass, lymphadenopathy or free fluid is
detected. Penile prosthetics are partially imaged.

SWALLOW TEST ([**2180-11-29**]): Mildly impaired oral phase and minimal
penetration of thin liquids without aspiration

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the floor team for medical management of SSCP
as he was not a candidate for cardiac cath [**3-13**] to elevated Cr.
He developed worsening mental status on the floor, with
increased combativeness, agitation, and disorientation.  Pt was
admitted to the MICU with suspicion of EtOH/Benzo withdrawal.

1) AMS: Upon transfer to the MICU, the pt was combative,
thrashing, confused, tachycardic (130s), hypertensive (200s).
He initially received large doses of Ativan and Valium with the
suspicion of EtOH/Benzo withdrawal.  His agitation did not
resolve.  He was intubated shortly thereafter [**3-13**] to inability
to swallow his own secretions and concern for aspiration.  He
was kept intubated for 8 days with high doses of propofol for
sedation.
