Chief Complaint:
Hyperkalemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
64 y/o F w/ ESRD [**2-21**] IgA nephropathy s/[**Name Initial (MD) **] failed CRT [**2173**] on HD
(MWF) through LUE AVF since [**2193**] and recent MVR surgery in [**Month (only) **]
[**2198**] presents to ED from rehab with diarrhea, nausea, and chills
x2 days. Patient states she has been feeling unwell for 2 days.
She has had approximately 14 episodes of diarrhea per day and
these have become less frequent today. Also had nausea but no
vomiting. Pt states she has been feeling more fatigued since
these symptoms started and has had a nonproductive cough for 2
days. Also endorses chills and decreased appetite. She missed HD
yesterday because she felt unwell. Denies lightheadednes, bloody
stool, abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath,
palpitations, vomiting.  She has been in rehab since her MVR
surgery.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  T 98.6 P 73 BP 131/63 RR18 SaO2 91%
2L NC. Pt was initially satting in the 80s but improved with O2.
 K was 7.4 and EKG showed QRS 180 (prior 104). CXR was
consistent with volume overload and suggestive of RML pna.
Patient was given albuterol, 2g CaGluc, 10 U Insulin, 1 amp D50.
 After treatment, QRS decreased to 172. She was also given
levoloxacin 750mg IV for pneumonia. Renal was consulted and
recommended emergent HD for hyperkalemia with associated EKG
changes.
 .
On arrival to the MICU, patient states she felt better and her
last BM was more formed. She was started on HD upon arrival to
the unit.
.
On the floor, the patient has a slight headache, but otherwise
is asymptomatic. Her nausea has resolved and her diarrhea is
improved.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 F w/ ESRD [**2-21**] IgA nephropathy s/p failed cadaveric transplant
in [**2173**] on HD (TRS) through LUE AVF since [**2193**] who presented
with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea admitted to ICU for emergent
dialysis for volume overload and hyperkalemia. The patient had
resolution of her hyperkalemia and volume overload after HD and
was transferred to the floor.
.
# Hyperkalemia: Patient was found to have K 7.4 with prolonged
QRS and LBBB. Hyperkalemia felt most likely due to missing HD on
day prior to admission.  Underwent emergent dialysis with
normalization of her potassium level and QRS narrowing back to
baseline.  She was hemodialysed on [**1-16**], and [**3-9**]. Plan
for next HD session on [**2199-3-12**] to return to her normal T,Th,Sa
HD schedule.
.
# Volume overload: Likely related to missing HD due to acute
illness.  On admission, weight was ~ 3kg higher than dry weight
~ 39.7 Kg.  Patient underwent HD with 1.2 and 2.0 L in
ultrafiltrate removed during first 2 inpatient sessions.  Oxygen
requirement of 2L was no longer needed after removal of excess
fluid.  Due to patient's anuria, she is dependent on HD and
importance of maintening dry weight can not be emphasized more
clearly. At discharge, she was at her dry weight of 39KG.
.
# Hypoxia: Oxygen requirement of 2L on admission.  Due to chest
x-ray suggestive of questionable right middle lobe pneumonia,
was started on vancomycin, cefepime and levaquin in setting of
report of chills and cough for 2 days prior to admission.  RML
opacity improved with fluid removal during HD on review of
repeat films. Similar opacity on prior films has fluctuated with
volume status.  Given lack of leukocytosis and fever as well as
resolution of oxygen demand after HD, antibiotics were
discontinued upon transfer to the floor.  She remained afebrile
with minimal intermittant cough, felt to be non-infectious in
nature.
.
# Diarrhea: Symptoms improved over hospital course. Given
residence in rehab facility and transient course, likely viral
in nature. Lack of fever or leukocytosis, and benign abdominal
exam, made C. diff unlikely, so this was not checked.

# s/p mitral valve replacement: Pt is on coumadin with goal INR
3-3.5. INR was subtherapeutic at 1.8. She was started on a
heparin gtt to bridge and her coumadin was increased to 2mg with
increase to supratherapeutic levels and subsequently held.  She
is being discharged on heparin gtt until she reaches therapeutic
INR on Warfarin.
.
#Troponinemia: Likely related to renal failure in the setting of
HD. Patient denies chest pain. EKG changes likely related to
hyperkalemia. Baseline trop is 0.4. She was continued on her
home baby aspirin.
.
# HLD: Continued statin.
