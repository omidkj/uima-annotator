Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 281**]
Chief Complaint:
C/O increasing SOB -returns for bronchoscopic evaluation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
flexible and rigid bronchoscopy for debridement of granulation
tissue above and below T-Tube with interum trach then
replacement of T-Tube.


History of Present Illness:
65yo Portuguese speaking woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG with
chronic trach c/b tracheal stenosis s/p tracheal resconstruction
[**6-/2192**], transferred now from [**Hospital6 302**] with pneumonia.
She underwent 3v CABG in 10/[**2190**]. Hospital course was
complicated by recurrent pneumonias and 5week intubation. She
eventually underwent tracheostomy, which has been in place since
late [**2190**]. In [**6-/2192**] she underwent tracheal revision at [**Hospital1 18**].
She has been evaluated by interventional pulmonary multiple
times by bronchoscopy for subglottic stenosis and T-tube mucus
plugging, last on [**2193-5-10**].
.
She presented to [**Hospital6 302**] ED [**2193-7-11**] with a few days
of productive cough and nausea, and was diagnosed with
right-sided pneumonia. Initial vitals T 98.9 HR 78 BP 125/32 RR
22 100%6L/min. She was treated with levofloxacin and vancomycin.
She was evaluated by cardiology, who felt she was in slight
congestive heart failure, and ENT, who performed fiberoptic
laryngoscopy and tracheoscopy. Laryngoscopy reveals complete
subglottic obstruction, ?laryngeal web or subglottic mass.
Tracheoscopy revealed collapsing distal trachea with inspiration
and granulation around the tracheostomy tube.

On presentation now she c/o pain along her right lateral chest
wall. She denies shortness of breath. She complains of some
nausea, but denies abdominal pain.



Past Medical History:
tracheal stenosis
prolonged intubation (5-6 weeks) after
CABG X 3 performed at OSH in 12/[**2190**].
Balloon dilitation of the proximal trachea with excision of
granulation tissue on anterior tracheal wall,
IDDM, CAD, MI, PNA [**2189**]

Social History:
son and daughter live in [**Name (NI) 5503**] area. Very supportive
family


Family History:
non-contributory

Physical Exam:
GEN: comfortable, no accessory muscle use, coughing, NAD
HEENT: PERRL, anicteric, MMM, OP clear
Neck: trach, stridor, supple, no LAD, JVP nondistended
CV: tachy, regular, no mrg
Resp: diffuse inspiratory and expiratory wheeze, milding
decreased BS at right base
Abd: +BS, soft, NT, ND, no masses
Ext: no edema, 2+ DPs
Neuro: alert, answers yes/no questions appropriately, MAEW


Pertinent Results:
[**2193-7-22**]
EXAMINATION: AP chest.
A single AP view of the chest is obtained on [**2193-7-22**] at 1145
hours. It is very limited technically. It does, however, appears
to show cardiomegaly. Tracheostomy is in place. Right-sided PICC
line has its tip projected over the expected location of the
proximal SVC. There is increased density in both lower lung
zones, particularly on the right side, likely representing
airspace disease.
IMPRESSION:
Very limited image technically showing likely airspace disease
both lower lungs, more marked on the right side.

Bedside swallow eval:
SUMMARY / IMPRESSION:
Functional oral and pharyngeal swallowing ability with no signs
of aspiration at the bedside.  "Silent" aspiration, or
aspiration
without coughing can not be ruled out on the basis of a bedside
swallowing evaluation alone.  However, she seems safe to eat
regular consistency solids and to drink thin liquids.  Nursing
reports that she can swallow pills whole w/water without
difficulty.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.  Diet of regular consistency solids and thin liquids

2.  Pills whole with water

3.  We would be happy to perform a videoswallow if there are
    further concerns about aspiration while eating or drinking


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt admitted to MICU for resp monitoring and frequent sxn'ing.
Sputum cultures obtained  and started on levo, vanco while
awating culture results- history of MRSA PNA. Pt was transferred
from MICU to general floor on HD#3.  Flex bronch was performed
on HD#4 which showed granulation tissue above and below the
T-Tube; T-Tube itself patent and supra and subglottic edema
noted. Moderate secretions cleared. Started on mucinex to break
up secretions, decadron and [**Hospital1 **] protonix as well as ongoing
genttle Iv hydration. picc Line was placed for IVAB.
HD#6 Pt scheduled for rigid bronch in the OR for laser
debridement of granulation tissue with ENT. D/t edema after
clearing of granultion tissue, T-tube was unable to be
re-inserted and temp trach was placed through stoma.
Swallow eval was done d/t daughter's report of pt coughing w/
po's as outpt. Bedside swallow eval was done w/o evidence of
aspiration. Tolerated reg diet.
HD#10 T-Tube was replaced in the OR w/o incident. Persistant
edema was noted which does not appear to be improving on oral
steriods therefore, they are being rapidly tapered. Edema will
improve gradually.
During this hospital course pt's glucose was difficult to
control on standing insulin and sliding scale dosing. [**Last Name (un) **]
team was consulted re: glucose management w/ some improvement
-further improvement will be noted when steriod taper completed.
She will remain on IVAB Vancomycin for 2 week total course.
She will have follow up w/ interventional pulmonology for a
bronchoscopy in 4 weeks.
