CT TORSO04/05/11
1. New right-sided opacity in the right upper lobe most likely
pneumonia;
other etiologies such as hemorrhage could cause a similar
appearance;
neoplastic infiltrate less likely given rapid development of
findings.
2. Interval increase in size of mediastinal and right hilar
lymph nodes,
nonspecific, could be reactive; however, cannot exclude
neoplastic
involvement.
3. New small right pleural effusion.
4. Stable calcified right adnexal mass most likely calcified
fibroid, less
likely calcified ovarian mass or pedunculated broad ligament
fibroid.
5. Stable liver hypodensities, some appear as liver cysts, some
are too small
to be characterized.
6. Stable asymmetric enlargement of the thyroid gland.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 71yo F with PMH acute myelogenous leukemia, neutropenic fever,
throid goiter, admitted to OMED service for neutropenic fever
found to have right upper lobe infiltrate, she was treated with
broad spectrum antibiotics, her course was complicated by acute
renal failure after discussion with patient and family dialysis
was declined and the decision was made to provide comfort care
was made. She developed uremia and expired with her family at
the bedside.
.
# Goals of care: The patient developed acute renal failure and
uremia. Her oncologist identified her AML course as severely
progressive with an expceted life expectancy of days to weeks.
Given her poor prognosis, a family meeting was held and it was
decided that dialysis was not in her goals of care. She
developed uremia, hyprekalemia, hyponatraimia and expired on the
morning of hospital day 13 with her family at the bedside.
.
# Neutropenic fever: patient was admitted with neutorpenic fever
and no clear source of infection she was initially continued on
aztreonam/vanc with continuation of home acyclovir and
fluconazole. Fevers persisted; Flagyl was added for anaerobic
coverage. Given persistant fevers and lack of source, CT Torso
was performed [**2157-4-19**] and showed a right upper lobe pneumonia
that was new from her last scan in [**Month (only) 404**]. Her fluconazole was
changed to voriconazole, and gentamycin was added to her abx
regimen. Bronchoscopy was attempted, but could not be done in
the procedure suite as there was significant narrowing of the
trachea from compression by her goiter. Fever curve trended
downwards, but serial chest xray showed interval increase in the
size of the PNA. Voriconazole was changed to ambisome, and
levofloxacin was added for atypical coverage. She was taken to
the ICU for repeated bronchoscopy attempt. Bronchoscopy
performed which showed [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 34122**] drainage. It was difficult
to advance the scope suggesting post-obstructive pneumonia. Gram
stain showed gram positive rods which were likely [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13607**],
negative for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] culture was added on and results were
pending at the time of death. She completed a course of
levofloxacin for atypical pneumonia and antibiotics were
narrowed to vanco/meropenem.
.
# Hyponatremia: Na began to trend downward on [**2157-4-19**]. Initially
thought to be hypovolemia given diaphoresis and poor po intake,
but after hydration Na continued to fall. Renal was consulted
who identifed SIADH. She was put on a fluid restriction, salt
tabs, and furosemide. Her sodium improved mildly however she
became anuric and free water could not be mobilized.
.
# Acute renal insufficiency: Creatinine trended up on [**2157-4-23**]
believed to be related to a combination of AML and ATN from
nephrotoxic antibiotics. Renal ultrasound was negative.
Medications were renally dosed and nephrotoxins were avoided.
Creatinine continued to rise and the patient became anuric.
Hyponatremia worsened as she became increasingly  hypervolemic,
she developed uremia and hyperkalemia. Dialysis was not in her
goals of care. Cause of death is attributed to acute renal
failure.
.
# Pancytopenia: Patient was transfusion dependent related to AML
and bone marrow failure. She was ransfused intermittently for
platelets < 10 and Hct < 25.
