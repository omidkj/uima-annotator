History of Present Illness:
47y/o white female with history of falls. She was transferred in
from [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital for TSAH.  Pts daughter reports that pt has a history
of falls /
approx 1/week since "hysterectomy resulted in some sort of nerve
damage".  Pt uses cane to walk.  Daughter states she fell
1 1/2 weeks ago while [**Holiday 944**] shopping.  Then this past friday
(4 days ago)- the pt had diarrhea and when she was getting up
from the toilet - she suddenly got dizzy and started to vomit.
Daughter states she has not been herself since that time/unable
to have conversation over the phone.  Has had a headache and
intemittent emesis since associated with lethargy and inability
to "interact appropriately".  Daughter is [**Name8 (MD) **] RN and came from CT
after work this pm to sort things out.  Pt was seen at another
hospital for the same complaints(other [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital1 1474**]) and was
treated for
dehydration and released.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2162-12-13**] 8:34 PM
This very limited study appears to show no definite sign for an
intracranial mass or hydrocephalus, nor is there shift of
normally midline structures. The FLAIR images disclose high
signal within a few cerebral sulci of the posterior aspect of
the right frontal lobe, the anterior aspect of the right
parietal lobe, as well as the central sulcus. These findings
presumably correspond to the subarachnoid hemorrhage noted on
the prior CT scan. There is no definite evidence for a source of
the hemorrhage. There were no other visible intracranial
abnormalities on this admittedly limited study. There is
moderate mucosal thickening in the ethmoid sinuses, and to a
mild degree within the maxillary sinuses. The sinus
abnormalities could represent an allergic or some other type of
inflammatory process.

CONCLUSION: Technically limited study, with apparent
redemonstration of localized right cerebral hemispheric
subarachnoid hemorrhage, as noted above. As was stressed in the
dictation of the CT scan and CT angiogram, standard catheter
angiography is the optimum technique to exclude a vascular
malformation and provide the most detailed assessment for
potential aneurysms.

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2162-12-13**] 1:20 AM

Non-contrast axial scanning was performed through the brain. A
CTA was performed of the head during rapid infusion of
intravenous contrast. No prior studies are available for
comparison.

FINDINGS: The non-contrast head CT scan demonstrates
subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right sylvian fissure. There is
no evidence of infarction and there is no hydrocephalus.

The CT arteriogram demonstrates patency of the internal carotid
arteries, vertebral and basilar arteries, and their major
intracranial branches. No stenoses or occlusions are noted.
There is a tiny outpouching at the left middle cerebral artery
bifurcation. This measures approximately 2 mm in diameter. It
appears focally enough that it likely represents a tiny
aneurysm. However, an infundibulum cannot be excluded.

There is a prominent vein coursing through the right sylvian
fissure on the preliminary report, this raised a concern of an
arteriovenous malformation. However, I do not detect a nidus of
an AVM. This may represent a simply anomalously enlarged venous
drainage pattern without a high flow lesion. A dural
arteriovenous malformation could give rise to an enlarged
cerebral vein without demonstration of the nidus on a CTA. If an
arteriovenous malformation or a dural fistual remain clinical
concerns, a catheter arteriogram would be the most reliable test
to confirm or exclude this diagnosis. The remainder of the
vessels appear normal.

CONCLUSION: 2-mm infundibulum or aneurysm at the left middle
cerebral artery bifurcation.

Prominent right sylvian vein. No nidus is identified. This may
represent an anomalously enlarged vein without an arteriovenous
shunt. However, a dural arteriovenous malformation is an
alternative cause of this prominent vein. If clinically
significant, this distinction would best be made with a catheter
arteriogram.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2162-12-14**] 10:42 PM

FINDINGS: There is no significant change compared to the prior
examination. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is again seen within sulci
of the right frontal lobe and the sylvian fissure. There is no
mass effect, shift of the normally midline structures, or major
vascular territorial infarct. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. There is no hydrocephalus. The
osseous structures are unremarkable. The paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells are well aerated.

IMPRESSION: No significant change compared to the prior
examination and extent of subarachnoid hemorrhage involving the
right frontal lobe and sylvian fissure.

OPERATORS: Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Name5 (PTitle) **], [**Name5 (PTitle) **].

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to MR of the head from [**2162-12-13**] as
well as a CTA of the head from the same date.

The right internal carotid artery injection shows no aneurysms,
vascular malformations, or stenoses. Note is made of a prominent
vein of [**Last Name (un) 70890**].
