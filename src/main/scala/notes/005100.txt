Echocardiogram in [**2175-12-17**] with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**] dilated.
RA mildly dilated.  Symmetric LVH.  Left ventricular ejection
fraction greater than 55%.  RV free wall is hypertrophied,

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was an 83-year-old gentleman with
severe aortic stenosis and three vessel coronary artery
disease status post catheterization with elevated wedge
pressure in the CCU and anticipation of AVR and CABG.

1. CAD:  Patient with three-vessel disease.  Was continued on
his aspirin, started on low dose beta-blocker, continued on
his Imdur.  Patient was planned for CABG with his AVR.
Surgery is planned for [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**2-19**].  Otherwise, patient
remained chest pain free throughout the course of his stay.

2. Fluid overload:  Patient had elevated wedge pressures and
left sided heart pressures.  Patient initially euvolemic was
diuresed with 40 mg IV Lasix and put out total was 5 liters
negative throughout the course of his CCU admission.
Eventually, Swan was pulled with stable numbers and otherwise
euvolemic.

3. Atrial fibrillation:  Patient was continued on his digoxin
and his home regimen.  Continued on a calcium-channel blocker
and also started on low dose beta-blocker and titrated down
on his calcium-channel blocker, which can eventually be
discontinued as his beta-blockers titrated up.  Patient's
Coumadin was on hold initially and was started on Lovenox at
therapeutic b.i.d. dosing and in anticipation of surgery.
This can be held the morning of surgery and the patient can
be anticoagulated until that time.

4. Hypothyroidism:  The patient was stable on his home
regimen of Armour Thyroid at 180 mcg q.d.

5. Peptic ulcer disease:  Patient was stable.  Continued on
his Zantac.

6. Asthma:  Patient was stable and continued on his Singulair
and was transitioned to salmeterol and fluticasone for dosing
here.  Can continue Advair at time of discharge.

7.[**Last Name (STitle) 53610**]c stenosis:  Patient was stable.  Valve area of 0.88,
gradient of 46.  The patient will return on [**Last Name (LF) 766**], [**2-19**]
for surgery by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **].  Patient had preoperative
workup done during this admission and was started on
perioperative beta-blocker during this admission.  Patient
was given some vitamin K to help decrease his INR.  His INR
had still not reached goal of 1.2, so the patient was
discharged home on Lovenox and off Coumadin to come back for
surgery once his INR is below 1.2 anticipated [**Last Name (Prefixes) 766**].

Patient had carotid Dopplers at [**Hospital1 1474**] which were negative
on [**1-24**].

8. Hypertension:  The patient was stable on low dose
beta-blocker and lower dose of calcium-channel blocker and
otherwise stable after diuresis.
