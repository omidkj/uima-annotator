Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2724**]
Chief Complaint:
new back pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Transpedicular decompression, T10, of epidural metastatic
disease with instrumented fusion from T8-T12.


History of Present Illness:
This 83 yo male who is a pt of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with known history of
prostate cancer and lytic lesion in T10 diagnosed in [**2112**] s/p
radiation presents with complaint of severe lower thoracic back
pain thought to be T11-12 radicular in nature. Of note patient
came off his second line hormonal therapy in [**Month (only) 205**] after
progression of disease was noted. He was taken off ketonconazole
and had his hydrocortisone tapered. DES was started
concurrently. At that time he began to notice a dull aching
right side lower back pain. He underwent MRI of the lumbar
spine, incomplete due to intolerance to pain as well as
claustrophobia. At the beginning of [**Month (only) 216**], there was concern
for possible progression of disease in the thoracic spine that
may need XRT. Patient now presents with severe bilateral lower
back pain that's different to the prior symptoms. His new pain
is sharper and feels like a band around the back. He denies any
parathesia or weakness of the lower extremities. He denies any
bowel or bladder issues. He has no fever, chill or rigorm
dysuria, or change in urinary frequency.
.
In the ED neuro exam was essentially intact and rectal tone was
normal. He was noted to have severe hypertension which improved
on pain meds as well as metoprolol. He was admitted for MRI of
the thoracic spine to rule out cord compression, BP control, as
well as pain management.

[**2114-9-10**] MR T spine -
1. Multiple lesions noted from the T8-T11 vertebral bodies, with
extensive
involvement of the T10 and T11 vertebral bodies, and a prominent
epidural
component, seen along the right side of the spinal canal from
anterior to
posterior aspects, causing displacement and compression of the
cord, at T10 and T11 levels. Perineural/foraminal and right
paravertebral components as well, as described above.
2. Involvement of the ribs along with soft tissue mass, related
to metastatic involvement, from T8-T12 levels, inadequately
assessed on the present study as not targeted.
3. Mild enhancement of the meninges/anterior surface of the
thecal sac from T6-T12 levels.

[**2114-9-11**] - CT Head
No hemorrhage, edema or mass effect.

[**2114-9-14**] Tspine xray
FINDINGS: Metallic fixation is identified in the lower thoracic
spine, of
the T8, T9, T11 and T12 vertebral bodies. Satisfactory alignment
on AP and
lateral views. Prominent mural calcification of the aorta in
keeping with
atherosclerosis. Bowel gas pattern is unremarkable. A small
right basal
pleural effusion is seen.

[**2114-9-15**] CXR
FINDINGS:

Compared to the most recent prior film the right CP angle is
better
visualized, now not cut off from view. There is an opacity in
this region
- more remote prior film showed a nodule in this area. I would
suggest follow up of this region to see if this is evolving.
Otherwise, there is no
significant interval change. Orthopedic hardware stable in
appearance.

[**2114-9-16**] Shoulder right xray
Four total radiographs are submitted. There is moderate
osteoarthritis of the acromioclavicular joint. There is also
moderate osteoarthritis of the
glenohumeral joint with osteophyte formation and joint space
narrowing. No
fracture or malalignment identified. Visualized right Upper
lungs are clear.




Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo with metastatic prostate ca s/p xrt in [**2112**] for thoracic
mets now progressing through second line hormonal therapy and
was recently started on [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] presents with band like
lower back pain without radiation or neurological deficit. He
was being followed by oncology. He had a PSA near 60, this was
increasing despite treatment with DES. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his outpt
oncologist, decided to stop [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 97322**].  Coumadin which had
been initiated with DES as prophylaxis was d/c'd also

Lower back pain:  Pt had no focal neurologic exams, but given
new pain there was concern for cord compression.  He received an
MRI in ED which showed T10-12 compression.  IV steroids were
initiated.  Neurosurgery and Radiation Oncology were consulted.
Pain controlled with MS Contin and prn dilaudid.  Surgery was
decided to be the best option as pt has history of radiation in
this area in the past. He was brought to the OR [**2114-9-13**] where
under general anesthesia he underwent transpedicular
decompression, T10, of epidural metastatic disease with
instrumented fusion from T8-T12. He tolerated this procedure
well, did require intra-op transfusions.  He remained intubated
and brought to the ICU overnight.  Post op he had full strength.
 He was extubated on the first post op morning.  His diet and
activity were advanced. He had JP drain in that was monitored
and removed [**2114-9-15**].  He was transferred to the floor [**9-15**].  He
did have episode of hypertension [**9-16**] enzymes were flat and EKG
unchanged. He was monitored on telemetry.  He had shoulder pain
on right and xrays showed no fracture or dislocation but
osteophyte and osteoarthritis. he was tapered off his decadron.
Wound was clean and dry. He was evaluated by PT/OT and felt safe
for discharge to home. On [**9-17**], patient has been intermittently
hypertensive, his lopressor was increased to 37.5mg [**Hospital1 **] and prn
hydralazine 10mg IV was administered. Patient's BP was reduce to
the 130s. He remained stable and was discharged to home on [**9-18**].
