HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 76 year old
female who became short of breath and had dyspnea on
exertion.  She was taken to the cardiac catheterization
laboratory where severe two vessel disease was found as well
as a 3+ mitral regurgitation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Congestive heart failure.
2.  Diabetes mellitus with chronic renal insufficiency with
baseline creatinine of 2.1.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Anemia.
5.  Mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
6.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
7.  Depression.

The patient was taken to the catheterization laboratory and
found to have the severe two vessel disease as well as the
mitral regurgitation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, she was
afebrile and her vital signs were stable.  The pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Extraocular movements are intact.  Her neck was supple with
no jugular venous distention and no bruits.  The lungs had
crackles bilaterally.  She had normal expansion.  Her heart
was regular rate and rhythm.  She had a loud III/VI systolic
murmur best heard in the left upper sternal border.  her
abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds were
present and extremities were warm and well perfused with no
cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count was 9.3, hematocrit
36.1, platelet count 243,000.  Sodium 140, potassium 4.7,
chloride 105, bicarbonate 21, blood urea nitrogen 36,
creatinine 2.1 and blood sugar 100.  Prothrombin time was
12.8, partial thromboplastin time 28.0 and INR was 1.1.

Chest x-ray was within normal limits.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room
on [**2179-9-7**], where a coronary artery bypass graft times two,
mitral valve replacement and right coronary endarterectomy
were performed. The patient was transferred postoperatively
to the CSRU for care.  She was slowly weaned off her
ventilator and due to a metabolic acidosis, it was decided
not to extubate the patient immediately postoperatively.  She
was started on Plavix for the RCA endoarterectomy and coumadin
for the mitral valve replacement. The anterior cords were too
attenuated for a mitral repair. The patient was weaned down to
CPAP on postoperative day number one.  She continued to do
well.  Her chest tubes were removed and that is when Coumadin
was started for prophylaxis for her Mitral valve replacement.
The patient was extubated on [**2179-9-9**], and she continued to
improve. The plavix was discontinued when she was therapeutic
on coumadin.  The pain was controlled on p.o.  pain medicines
and she was tolerating a regular diet.  She continued to be
coumadinized at that time.  The patient continued to do well
in the CSRU and was transferred to the floor on [**2179-9-10**].
She continued on her Coumadin and INR was 2.1 and slowly
rising at that time.  She was given another 3 mg Coumadin on
[**9-12**].  Her
chest tubes had been removed.  Her Foley was
removed at that time as well.  Her wires were cut due to the
fact that her INR was elevated and did not want to risk the
chance of bleeding.  Physical therapy saw her and she
ambulated and had excellent mobility and good exercise
tolerance.  It was felt that she was safe for discharge to
home when medically stable. She continued to do well and on
[**2179-9-11**].  she cleared Stage V with physical therapy,
continued aggressive pulmonary toilet and continued to
anticoagulate her.  She was discharged home in stable
condition with goal INR of 2.0 to 3.5.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lipitor 40 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q4hours p.r.n.
3.  Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q.h.s. for a goal INR of 2.0 to 3.5.
4.  Protonix 40 mg p.o. once daily.
5.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
6.  Zaroxylin.
7.  Potassium Chloride 20 meq p.o. twice a day.
8.  Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. twice a day.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

FOLLOW-UP:  She was instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
in four weeks and with vascular surgery in two to four weeks
and her primary care physician in [**Name Initial (PRE) **] couple days to have her
INR followed.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease and mitral regurgitation, status
post coronary artery bypass graft and mitral valve
replacement.
2.  Carotid stenosis, status post right carotid
endarterectomy.
3.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Status post myocardial infarction.
6.  Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline creatinine 2.1.
7.  Congestive heart failure.
8.  Depression.
9.  Spinal stenosis.

The patient is discharged home in stable condition.
