SOCIAL HISTORY:  Former smoker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.6, blood
pressure 102/64, heart rate 86, respiratory rate 16, oxygen
saturation 100% on room air.  The patient appeared to be a
rather thin woman in no apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose and throat examination within normal limits.
Cardiovascular examination regular rate and rhythm, II/VI
systolic ejection murmur, soft heart sounds.  Chest:  Good
inspiratory effort, clear to auscultation bilaterally,
occasional crackles bibasilarly.  Abdominal examination:
Bowel sounds present, abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities:  Bilateral pitting edema, extremities otherwise
warm and well perfused, no pulses palpable secondary to
edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 29.9, white blood cell count
9.2.  PT 13.9, PTT 150.  Glucose 90, BUN 56, creatinine 1.8,
potassium 4.4.  An electrocardiogram obtained on [**2165-9-10**]
showed a probable accelerated junctional rhythm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was originally admitted to the
Medicine service.  She was placed on intravenous heparin.
She was continued on amiodarone.  The patient was also
started on amoxicillin for endocarditis prophylaxis.  The
patient was transfused with two units of packed red blood
cells.  The patient was diuresed.  At the time, Cardiac
Surgery was consulted about a possible surgical intervention,
given valvular disease.

On [**2165-9-12**], the patient underwent tricuspid valve repair (#32
[**Doctor Last Name **] annuloplasty ring) and mitral valve repair (#29 St.
[**Male First Name (un) 1525**] mechanical valve).  The procedure was without any
complications.  Please see the full operative note for
details.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in
stable condition.  The patient continued to be in accelerated
junctional rhythm.  No ectopy was noted.  Electrophysiology
service was consulted.  Their opinion was that both the A and
the V leads were malfunctioning.  The patient was extubated
on postoperative day one.  The patient tolerated extubation
well.  Physical Therapy was consulted to follow the patient
throughout the hospitalization.  The chest tubes and the
urine catheter were removed.  The patient was continued on
intravenous heparin and she was also given a dose of Coumadin
on postoperative day three.

Electrophysiology service was following the patient
throughout the hospitalization.  The patient's pacemaker was
re-interrogated on postoperative day four.  Their opinion was
that the pacing leads are not functioning well, but overall
system is adequate with VVI pacing.  They thought that lead
revision would very likely be a long procedure without
guarantee of improving quality of right atrial or right
ventricular leads.  Given the fact that the patient is not
pacemaker dependent, the decision was made to not proceed
with lead revision but to follow the patient clinically.

The patient was also seen in-house by the congestive heart
failure attending, who recommended changes to the diuresis
regimen.  The patient continued to do well.  She continued to
be in junctional rhythm with some ectopy.  On [**2165-9-18**], the
patient had one run of ventricular tachycardia (four beats),
which was not repeated.  In addition, the patient's potassium
level was measured at 2.1.  It was adequately replenished
with oral and intravenous potassium at the time.  The
patient's repeat potassium was stable at 4.2.

The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility on
[**2165-9-19**] in stable condition.
