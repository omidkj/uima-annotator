Service:  Neurosurgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 77-year-old
gentleman status post a right frontal VP shunt placement on
[**2150-10-13**], who has been doing well until mid [**Month (only) **] when
he began complaining of headache.  He was admitted to the
[**Hospital3 **] at that time with a subdural hematoma.  The VP
shunt was ligated, and the patient was discharged to rehab
again.  Head CT at that time of D/C showed increased
hydrocephalus, but stable.

Patient was sent to rehab and became increasingly confused
and not able to follow coherent streams of thought or
commands.  Family called Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and felt that repeat head CT
needed to be done which showed an increase in the subdural
hematoma especially on the left to 3-4 cm in width, and the
patient was admitted for bedside drainage.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Diabetes.
2. Hypertension.
3. Hypercholesterolemia.
4. Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
5. Incontinence.
6. NPH.
7. Peptic ulcer disease.
8. Chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 2.
9. Dementia.
10. Clostridium difficile.
11. Ataxia.
12. Cellulitis.

The patient was admitted to the ICU.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His temperature was 98.3.  Blood
pressure was 136/62.  Heart rate 69.  Respiratory rate 17.
Sats 97%.  HEENT:  Neck was supple, no meningismus.  Mental
status:  Awake and alert, but not oriented.  Language is
fluent.  Attention is slow, but intact.  Recall is 0/4.
Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Motor exam:  Strength
in the upper extremities:  His right deltoid, wrist
extension, and triceps are [**5-3**].  Does not follow commands to
the left.  Sensory is really unable to test.  Does not follow
commands.  Reflexes were 0 in the upper extremities, 2+ at
the knees, 0 at the ankles.  His toes withdraw.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to the ICU setting.  Had a
bedside drainage of a subdural hematoma without
interprocedural complication.  The patient had the drain left
in place overnight.

CT on [**1-11**] after bedside drainage shows unchanged right
subdural hematoma, left subdural fluid collection was
slightly increased.  Repeat scan that the drainage procedure
was unsuccessful, and ........... the left subdural hematoma.
Therefore, the patient was taken to the OR on [**2151-1-12**] to
undergo a craniotomy and drainage of the left subdural
hematoma.

The surgery of the drainage of the subdural was on
[**2151-1-13**].  On [**2151-1-14**], the patient opened his eyes to
voice.  His speech was dysarthric.  He was following
commands, squeezing hands, flexing his legs, showing two
fingers.  Drain put out 30 cc.  Patient had a head CT, which
showed a decrease in the size of the left subdural fluid
collection and decrease in the left to right midline shift.
No change in ventricle size.  Patient's drain was removed.

On [**1-16**], he was arousable by voice, drowsy, tended to keep
his eyes closed.  Not really following commands.  Speech was
fluent, but mumbled.  He was spontaneously moving his upper
and lower extremities and purposeful.

On [**1-16**], the patient dropped his sats and had a blood gas
with a pO2 of 52.  The patient was urgently intubated.  There
were no complications with intubation.  Chest x-ray showed
decrease in the volume on the left side.  CTA showed no
evidence of pulmonary embolus.

Ultimately when patient was opening his eyes, biceps were [**5-3**]
on the right, [**6-2**] on the left.  He moves his feet to
commands.  Follows commands inconsistently.

He had a head CT on [**1-17**] which showed a left frontal
collection with no change and no change in the ventricle
size.  Tap of the VP shunt on [**1-18**] showed an opening
pressure of 25, and patient remained neurologically stable,
arousable, following commands, opening eyes.

Repeat head CT was done which showed worsening subdural
hematoma.  Patient had externalization of his VP shunt.  Was
extubated on [**2151-1-17**] successfully without any problems.

On [**1-21**], neurologically opening his eyes to voice.
Withdraws briskly to stimulation.  He is purposeful on the
left greater than right.  His drain was at 15 cm above the
tragus, now raised to 20.  The vent drain was changed to 5-10
cc an hour titrating to get 5-10 cc/hour of CSF drainage.

CT on [**2151-1-22**] showed decrease in subdural fluid and no
change in ventricular size.

On the 26th, the patient was awake and following commands,
attentive, and face was symmetric.  He had antigravity
strength in his bilateral upper extremities left greater than
right.  Grasps were [**6-2**] on the left, [**5-3**] on the right.  IPs
is [**6-2**] bilaterally.  Patient was out of bed sitting in a
chair.  Drain was raised to 25 cm above the tragus and
titrated to keep drainage 10 cc every four hours.

On [**2151-1-26**], the patient went to the operating room to have
revision of his VP shunt.  He tolerated the procedure well.
There were no intraoperative complications.  Postoperatively,
he was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit.  He was awake,
attentive, localizing briskly in the upper extremities,
withdrawing bilateral lower extremities.  His incision was
clean, dry, and intact.

On [**2151-1-28**], patient status post VP shunt revision was
awake, dysarthric, no drift, and impersistently following
commands.  His vital signs were stable.  He was transferred
to the regular floor on [**2151-1-27**].  On [**2151-1-29**], he was
awake.....
