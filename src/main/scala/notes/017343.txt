Brief Hospital Course:
1. Resp distress:  Pt presented with reports of apnea.  This
respiratory distress has many factors.  The first is an
unresolved pna.  This was treated with levo/flagyl.  The patient
was afebrile for his entire stay and did not produce much
secretions.  He will leave finishing a 10day total course of
levofloxacin.  The second aspect of his respiratory distress
involves an apnea, likely central.  The pt at many times during
admission had demonstrated Cheynes [**Doctor Last Name 6056**] respirations.  He
presented with an ABG 7.36/74/240 demonstrating severe CO2
retention.  The patient's oxygenation and CO2 status responded
well to BiPap.   We weaned him down on the BIPap and switched
him to face mask the day after admission.  By discharge the
patient was satting well on 10L NC.  Furthermore, the pt has
COPD and responded well to standing albuterol/atrovent nebs
which should be continued.  Finally the pt has CHF.  He was not
initially diuresed due to his initial low blood pressure.  By
the day of admission the pt was back on his home lasix dose of
20mg po qday.

2. DM: Continued on home NPH w/ISS which was tolerated well.

3. CAD: ASA, lipitor were continued throughout the admission.
-Mild troponin leak (but decr c/w prior admit) likely resp
distress + demand ischemia

4. CHF: Captopril and lasix were held initially due to low blood
pressure.  As the pt stabalized, captopril and lasix were
restarted to good effect.  He has a great deal of edema and thus
is total body water overload.  However, the pt presented
intravascularly dry and required fluid to maintain his BP.  Upon
discharge the pt is euvolemic so lasix administration should not
be aggressive.

5. FEN: Tubefeeds were continued
6. Proph: PPI, heparin sub cutaneous
7. Code: FULL
8. Communication: Daughter [**Name (NI) 3608**] [**Name (NI) **] (HCP) was unable to be
contact[**Name (NI) **] although many attempts were made through out the
hospitalization.  Other family members (sister/nephew) did visit
and they did not know the location of the health care proxy.
Speaking to the HCP would be helpful in determining code status
especially given the bleak prognosis and poor functional status
of the patient.
