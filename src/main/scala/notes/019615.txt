Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 106390**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old Bulgarian man with a history
significant for tachy--brady syndrome, s/p PCM (recently
replaced), atrial fibrillation on warfarin, CVA in [**2161**] and
dementia who presented with a spetic right shoulder.  He was
evaluated on [**2172-2-2**] with right wrist pain, a tap was performed
in the ED and was interpreted as benign; it does not appear that
it was cultured.  He presented again on [**2172-2-4**] and was admitted
to Medicine.  At that time, Plastic Surgery did not feel he had
septic arthritis.  He was treated for cellulitis and an E. coli
UTI.  His course was complicated by fecal impaction.  He was
discharged on [**2172-2-9**] on a 10 day course of vancomycin and
ceftriaxone.  He returned on [**2172-2-13**] with right shoulder pain.
He was febrile in the ED and a joint aspiration was attempted
but was unsuccessful.  He was observed to be mildly hypotensive,
so he was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU.  He ultimately underwent
joint arthrocentesis with 20 cc of purulent drainage.  Culture
thus far is unremarkable.  Family wishes to pursue conservative
treatment and avoid surgery/washout if possible.  ID consult was
obtained to ensure appropriate antibiotic therapy.  Uric acid
level was not elevated and there were no crystals reported in
the joint aspirate, making crystal-arthritis less likely to be
contributing.  ID recommended a TTE which was unchanged from
previous.  They recommended continuing the vancomycin,
increasing the Ceftriaxone to 2 g IV q24 hours and continuing
this until he sees Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in the [**Hospital **] Clinic at the
[**Hospital1 18**].  This plan was discussed at length with the patient's
daughter [**Name (NI) **] who was in agreement and will accompany the
patient to this appointment.  A PICC line was placed for him to
receive ongoing antibiotics.
.
Mr> [**Known lastname 106390**] should have weekly vanc trough levels, CBC with
differential, BUN/Cr and LFTs.  Please fax the results of these
to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1419**].
.
Given the inability to exonerate pacer-lead endocarditis, he may
require levofloxacin suppression after initial 4 week IV course.
