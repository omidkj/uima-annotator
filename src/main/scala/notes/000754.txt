from [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital.  Ms. [**Known lastname 92834**] has a past medical
history significant for coronary artery disease status post
stent, congestive heart failure, hypertension.  She was
evaluated at [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital for fatigue, heme positive stool.
Her hematocrit was found to be 17 and an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was negative.  She then underwent
a bowel prep and then colonoscopy at [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital.  They
found a right arterial venous malformation.  That
malformation was fulgurated on [**12-27**], which was two days
prior to presentation to [**Hospital1 188**].  The patient then developed increased temperatures,
abdominal distention.  This prompted the physicians taking
care of her to order a KUB.  This KUB showed free air.  She
then received a CT, which showed free air, pelvic fluid and
stranding.  This CT accompanied her to [**Hospital1 190**] and was seen by us.  The patient had been
started on antibiotics and transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further evaluation and
treatment.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 92834**] was admitted to the hospital
the night of [**12-29**] with an apparent cecal perforation
from her colonoscopy.  She was made NPO, given intravenous
fluids and antibiotics and laboratories were checked.  It was
soon apparent after she was admitted that she would need a
repair of her cecal perforation.  Therefore she went to the
Operating Room.  In the Operating Room she underwent an
exploratory laparotomy, a colorrhaphy, and an abdominal
irrigation.  In the Operating Room there was seen gross fecal
soilage of her abdominal cavity.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well.  Please refer to the official operative note
for all the details.

Immediately postoperatively the patient was admitted to the
PACU and was followed by the Intensive Care Unit team mostly
due to the patient's critical aortic stenosis.  The patient
received a Swan-Ganz catheter for monitoring and adequate
fluid resuscitation.  Her postoperative antibiotics included
Ampicillin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  There were some
difficulties in correctly placing her Swan secondary to her
anatomy, but after multiple manipulations the Swan was placed
correctly.  Of note the patient also had some postoperative
psychosis, which from past medical records the patient was
found to have a history of.  Therefore she was put on
scheduled Haldol intravenous.  This was soon discontinued
after a couple of days when the patient slowly returned to
baseline in mental status.  Also immediately postoperatively,
the patient was started on total parenteral nutrition
secondary to the patient's deconditioned state.

The patient did well in the Intensive Care Unit.  The only
issue being her high blood pressure and heart rate and the
patient was switched to intravenous hypertension medications
as the patient was not tolerating po.  By postoperative day
four the patient was able to be transferred to the floor.  At
this point she was also having return of her bowel function
and was started on clears, however, the total parenteral
nutrition was continued.  By postoperative day five the
patient was continued to have high blood pressures and heart
rate.  The patient was able to be switched to po hypertension
medications to which she had much better blood pressure
control.  She was also being diuresed with intravenous Lasix
with good response and over the next few days the patient was
slowly weaned off of her total parenteral nutrition,
restarted on a po diet and restarted on all of her home
medications.

The patient was discharged of all of her antibiotics, which
were Ampicillin, Levofloxacin and Flagyl on postoperative day
seven after a seven day course.  She had been afebrile and
her white count had returned to [**Location 213**].  Physical therapy and
occupational therapy consults had been obtained during the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital stay.  They felt due to her deconditioned
status that the patient would need an acute rehab stay
immediately upon discharge from the hospital.  This was also
reinforced as the patient did have a fall the day before
discharge in the bathroom while nursing was waiting outside.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is stable tolerating a
po diet and po medications, ambulating well with assistance,
however, unstable without assistance.  The patient was
somewhat incontinent of urine.
