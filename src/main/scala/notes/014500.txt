History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 89862**] is a 67 man  s/p radical prostatectomy, whose
post op course was complicated by PEA arrested on floor on POD
1. He was transferred to MICU for further management, started on
IV heparin and TPA for presumptive pulmonary embolism. Upon
arrival to MICU, he arrested again and was resusciatated in the
MICU. He was hypotensive and received multiple liters of IVF for
resuscitation. The then developed abdominal distension, oliguira
and reduced pedal pulses, elevated peak pressures and elevated
bladder pressures. Surgery was called for an acute abdominal
compartment syndrome.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 year old male with diagnosis of prostate cancer, s/p
prostatectomy, post-op course c/b by PEA arrest [**1-13**] presumed
pulmonary embolus, profound hypotension, multi-system failure,
post-operative hematoma, increasing abdominal distension
requiring emergent laparatomy

Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from the Urology service in
the setting of s/p radical retropubic prostatectomy c/b POD#1
PEA arrest, thought to be [**1-13**] to PE, for which the patient was
given tPA and started on a heparin drip. Patient's course was
complicated by hypotension (MAPs 50s), requiring frequent fluid
boluses (26L over 2d course) as well as levophed and
neosynephrine. Concurrent with this, patient became increasingly
difficult to ventilate, with concern for ACS.  He became acutely
anemic (10pt drop in 12hrs) and was found to have 16cm hematoma
at his operative drain site without signs of intra-abdominal or
retroperitoneal bleeds.  ICU stay also c/b ARF (thought to be
[**1-13**] to ACS), w rising creatinine and worsening acidosis,
requiring bicarbonate drip.  LFTs also were also noted to be
rising, thought to be [**1-13**] to shock liver in the setting
hypotension.  On POD#3, patient was noted to have worsening
abdominal distenion.  Bladder pressure was found to have risen
from 20 to 40.  In conjunction with general surgery and urology,
the patient was taken to the OR for urgent laparatomy on [**4-7**].
The following day, the patient was weaning down from his pressor
requirement, the PEEP was decreased from 20 to 10, he went back
to the OR for a washout and placement of an HD line. Femoral
venous line was obtained. CVVHD was initiated.  On [**4-9**], bedside
cystogram showed disruption of the bladder anastamosis. On [**4-10**]
his vent was weaned to pressure support, he was restarted on a
heparin gtt and tube feeds were started. He was transfused 1u
PRBC for Hct 23.1.  On [**4-11**] the patient went back to the OR for
washout and placement of [**State **] patch by ACS, IVC filter
placement, and urethrovesicular anastamosis by urology. On [**4-12**],
the white count was elevated and there was concern for possible
VAP so a Bronch/BAL was performed and showed no purulent
secretions. On [**4-13**] the HD line was replaced as it was no longer
working. On [**4-14**] the patient went back to the OR for abdominal
closure with mesh. Given concern for HIT (decreased plts),
Argatroban was started. On [**4-15**] the patient was extubated. . On
[**4-17**], he was tolerating a regular diet and TF were held for
copious diarrhea. Cdiff was sent. On [**4-18**] the patient remained
stable and was transfered to the floor after HD. He was then
transferred back to the Urology service.

Once back on the urology floor, he continued to do well,
argatroban was stopped once INR in therapeutic range, and pt
maintained on Coumadin.  He was noted to have LLE weakness and
proprioceptive deficit for which neurology was reconsulted.
Pt's renal function continued to improve and finished
hemodialysis on [**2196-4-22**].  He was maintained on telemetry in
sinus tachycardia throughout his stay on the floor.

Due to length of hospital stay and complexity of his hospital
course, a summary is also provided by systems.
