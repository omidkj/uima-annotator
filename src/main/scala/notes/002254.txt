The patient was admitted for a evaluation of a right lower
extremity free flap by the plastic CV service.  The lower
extremity warranted a vascular evaluation.  A right anterior
tibial artery angiogram was obtained for evaluation.  There
was noted necrosis at the site of a prior saphenous vein
harvest for a coronary artery bypass graft.  Vascular surgery
was consulted with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who determined
that a right below the knee amputation was needed and the
right below the knee amputation was performed on [**2150-12-7**].
The postoperative course was complicated by respiratory
failure requiring reintubation and transfer to Intensive Care
Unit and also some renal failure for which both the
cardiology service and the renal service were consulted.  The
patient's renal failure continued to improve.  The
electrophysiology service was consulted regarding an episode
of arrhythmia, the patient with a known automatic implantable
cardiac defibrillator.  The patient was evaluated and was
noted to have right ventricle sensing abnormality and
outpatient follow-up was deemed appropriate.  The patient
also had a large pleural effusion while he was intubated.
This effusion was drained on [**2150-12-14**], and the patient then
proceeded to self extubate which he was able to tolerate.  He
was begun on Coumadin on [**2150-12-16**], and continued on such.
The patient was doing well off the ventilator, had an episode
of  emesis on [**2150-12-17**].  The chest x-ray done repeated
showed a new right apical patchy alveolar opacity that was
likely consistent with aspiration.  The patient continued to
do relatively well with no need for frequent suctioning for
increased secretions.  The patient was transferred to the
Vascular Intensive Care Unit on [**2150-12-17**], and was doing
well.  A rehabilitation facility screen was instituted and
the patient continued to do well.  On the morning of
[**2150-12-22**], the patient was seen and evaluated and was verbal
about his desire to go to rehabilitation facility.  At around
0700 in the a.m. of [**2150-12-22**], the patient was noted to have
no respiratory rate on telemetry and was then evaluated and
found to be unresponsive at the bedside.  A code was called
and the patient was noted to have a systolic blood pressure
[**Location (un) 1131**] in the 70s on telemetry but no pulse was noted on
examination.  PEA progressing to ventricular fibrillation was
noted, and intermittent direct cardioversion per the
patient's own automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator was
noted.  The patient was intubated, no compressions or shocks
were performed as per the patient and family's wishes.  ACLS
protocol was instituted and the team was unable to obtain a
pulse throughout despite all the efforts.  The patient
expired at 0730 in the morning [**2150-12-22**].  Series of events
were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who then proceeded to
contact the family.  The medical examiner declined the
postmortem examination.  The family agreed to a voluntary
postmortem examination which was to take place as soon as
possible.
