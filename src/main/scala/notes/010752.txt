Brief Hospital Course:
[**10-25**] - Pt admitted s/p MVC, intubated prior to transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**].  Pt underwent exploratory laparotomy with discovery of a
small bowel perforation which was repaired by a small bowel
resection with a sid-by-side anastamosis.  She also underwent an
open reduction & internal fixation of a left open tibial plateau
fx.  Transferred to T/SICU post-operatively.  Pt placed in
cervical collar for C7 fracture. Forehead laceration repaired.
Facial fractures are non-operative.
[**10-28**] - Pt developing ARDS, requiring high PEEP & increasing
sedation
[**10-30**] - Pt paralyzed with cis-atracuronium & placed on ARDS

[**11-4**] - C.diff positive stools
[**11-8**] - MRSA & E.coli isolated from sputum.
[**11-10**] - Pt extubated but failed secondary to tachypnea & fatigue
with breathing, re-intubated.  Neurology consulted for
generalized weakness - preliminarily thought to be ICU myopathy.
[**11-13**] - Tracheostomy performed.
[**11-14**] - MRSA isolated from sputum.
[**11-15**] - EMG performed: no evidence of a generalized myopathy or
neuropathy.
[**11-16**] - EEG performed: findings consistent with widespread
encephalopathy.
[**11-20**] - Pt passed a bedside speech & swallow evaluation.
Plastics consulted on LLE wound: most likely will heal well, but
will perform flap closure if fails to heal.
[**11-21**] - Pt had successful video swallow study & started on PO
diet. PICC line placed for extended IV antibiotics to treat
MRSA.
[**11-22**] - Pt doing well with PO diet, increasing strength with
PT/OT, dispo planning for rehab facility.
