Date of Birth:  [**2130-4-12**]             Sex:   F

Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Imodium A-D / Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5880**]
Chief Complaint:
Pseudomembranous colitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Subtotal colectomy and ileostomy


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 62 year-old female, transferred from [**Hospital1 5109**] after a four day bout of progressive colitis which did
not respond to antibiotic therapy. She was initially transferred
to the medicine service and we were consulted. She had a high
white count, lactate level and a very tender, distended abdomen.
The decision was made to proceed with a subtotal abdominal
colectomy.

Past Medical History:
PMH: COPD, GERD, Barrett's esophagus, diverticulitis, IBD, colon
polyp, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hidradenitis, s/p anterior
cervical fusion C5-C7, TMJ, Raynaud's, depression, anxiety.

Pertinent Results:
Pathology:
1. Pseudomembranous colitis, due to C. difficile infection.
2.  There is diffuse disease of the cecum and colon, extending
to the distal margin.
3.  Ileal segment, within normal limits.

Echocardiogram [**12-31**]:
Limited views. The LV is not seen well enough to make a
reasonable assessment of either LV function or size. There is a
large pleural effusion present.

CTA chest [**1-10**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No PE.
2. Small left pneumothorax.
3. Diffuse emphysematous changes.
4. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and associated basilar
atelectasis.





Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 20825**] is a 62-year-old woman s/p rx with Augmentin for URI
2-3 weeks ago who was admitted to [**Hospital1 2436**]([**2192-12-24**]) with c.
diff pancolitis. On [**2192-12-26**] she was transferred to the  ICU with
hypotension (MAP 60)/sepsis and intubated on [**2192-12-27**] with
metabolic acidosis (HCO3 10). On [**2192-12-28**] she had thoracentesis
to remove bilateral pleural effusions (600 mL left, 800 mL
right). She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ?toxic megacolon and
?ischemic colitis. She received a subtotal colectomy with
ileostomy on [**2192-12-30**], with no immediate complications and 100 cc
blood loss. The morning after the operation sedation was held
and she remained unresponsive without spontaneous movement or
withdrawal of her extremities to pain. Neurology was consulted.
[**12-31**] CT head: No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage. [**12-31**] CT
C-spine w/o contrast: Significant spinal stenosis with cervical
spinal cord compression is present at the C6-C7 level secondary
to a large left-sided posterior spondylytic ridge. MRI head No
evidence of an acute hemorrhage. No acute infarct identified.
Findings consistent with chronic small vessel ischemia or
infarct in the pons
and cerebral deep white matter. Patient's responsiveness
improved over the next several days and lumbar puncture was
held. She eventually made a full neurological recovery, delerium
cleared, and it is ultimately unclear what the pons pathology
seen on MRI is attributed to. Ortho spine was also consulted and
did not see any need for surgical intervention given the c-spine
findings. Patient was started on TPN. Imaging revealed a
right-sided pneumothorax as well as rather large pleural
effusion, and a right-sided chest tube was placed that drained
several liters of fluid over the first several days. This
enabled vent weaning and eventual extubation. She was
transferred out of the ICU on [**2193-1-7**]. Once bowel function
returned she was gradually started on a diet and her TPN was
discontinued. Her chest tube was removed and she continued to
improve clinically. Several days prior to discharge she lost IV
access and a picc line was placed in IR. Later that day the
patient became increasingly dyspneic and her hypoxic. CTA was
performed that did not reveal a PE, and she ruled out for an MI.
Her picc line was eventually pulled back 4 cm to good effect. CT
did however show that her pleural effusions remained and she
continues to have an oxygen requirement now at baseline. She is
being discharged to rehab on POD11 afebrile, with stable
cardiopulmonary, tolerating a full diet, delerium nearly 100%
gone. She has completed 12 days of flagyl for cdifficile and is
no longer cdiff positive. She will continue for 2 additional
days to complete a 2 week course. Follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is
outlined below.
