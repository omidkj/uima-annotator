STUDIES:

ECG [**2151-4-1**]  3:54:48 AM Sinus rhythm with prolonged QTc
interval and prominent U waves. Low QRS voltage in the limb
leads. Consider electrolyte abnormality versus drug effect. No
previous tracing available for comparison.

TTE [**2151-4-1**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior
hypokinesia. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

ECG [**2151-4-1**]  3:23:02 PM Sinus bradycardia. Left axis deviation.
Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay. Marked
repolarization abnormalities with prominent U waves. Consider
electrolyte abnormality or drug effect. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2151-4-1**] multiple abnormalities as noted persist
without major change.

CXR PA/LAT [**2151-4-1**]: IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest reviewed in
the absence of prior chest radiographs: Patient has had median
sternotomy and coronary bypass grafting. Heart is not enlarged.
Mild interstitial abnormality could be edema or chronic
interstitial lung disease. Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.
Small bilateral pleural effusions. Left lower lobe is largely
collapsed. No pneumothorax. A dual-channel left supraclavicular
central venous catheters end in the low SVC and upper right
atrium respectively. No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
70 yo M w ESRD on HD who presented from rehab with hypertension
and hypoxia consistent with a decompensated diastolic CHF and
PNA improved back to baseline.

#. Hypoxia: Patient has baseline history COPD, unclear baseline
sats.  His CXR was c/w hypervolemia with possibly underlying
PNA. Labs were notable for a leukocytosis and increased BNP. He
was treated for HCAP with a course of Vanc/CTX/Levo and HD was
done with UF for fluid removal with improvement in sats and
decreased oxygen requirement to 3L.  Over the course of his
hospitalization, the patient's symptoms improved significantly
to the point of saturating >95% on room air on discharge.

#. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient has a history of
significant hypertension.  He was on a nitro gtt on admission.
This was quickly weaned, with SBP 140s but then rising.  Home
doses of Clonidine, Amlodip
