Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Throat and arm pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with thrombectomy of stent and promus
drug eluting stent to the mid right coronary artery


History of Present Illness:
78 year old female with history of NIDDM, MI x 3, and COPD who
presents who presents with chest pain found to have EKG changes
concerning for STEMI.
.
The patient was in her usual state of health until about two
weeks ago when she developed intermittent throat and arm pain.
This happened a few times but has increased in frequency over
the last three days, which is when she noted the developed of
chest pain as well. At around 1300 today, the pain became
constant, rated at an [**2170-9-11**], which was very concerning to the
patient so she called EMS at 1800 and was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
for further evaluation. Of note, the patient reports poor
compliance with her home medications of late, which include PO
antihyperglycemics, aspirin, and plavix.
.
She received ASA 325mg in the ambulance and rated her pain at
[**2170-3-7**] on arrival to the ED. She denied any SOB and reports the
pain was different than the pain she experienced with her prior
MI. In the ED, EKG was concerning for STEMI and cardiology was
notified. She received heparin gtt, plavix 600mg, and
integrillin and was sent for urgent cardiac catheterization.
During the cath, she was found to have a in-stent thrombosis in
the RCA, which was suctioned and angioplastied. Per report,
"successful primary angioplasty for inferior STEMI with 80%
thrombotic stenosis in the mid portion of previously placed
stent; this was treated with PCI and stenting utilizing 3.5x23mm
Promus DES, post-dilated to 3.75mm with excellent result." The
patient tolerated the procedure well and is being admitted to
the CCU for further monitoring.
.
On arrival to the CCU, vital signs were T- 97.6, HR- 90, BP-
103/77, RR- 19, SaO2- 88% on RA. The patient denies chest pain,
shortness of breath or headache. She remains hemodynamically
stable.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems, at this time, is notable for absence
of chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

Cardiac catheterization: [**12-29**]
1. Selected coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated 2 vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent disease.  The LAD had a 30-40% mid
vessel
stenosis slightly worsened from [**2164**].  The LCX in known to have
a
total flush occlusion. The mid RCA is diffulsely disease with an
80% in
stent restenosis and possible thrombus suggestive of very late
ISRS.
There is a focal 50% lesion at the distal RCA bifurcation
worsened from
[**2164**].  THE RPLV (very substantive vessel) stent placed in [**2164**]
is widely
patient.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a normotensive central
systemic
arterial pressure of 124/71 mm Hg.
3. Successful thrombectomy and PCI to the mRCA using 3.5x23mm
Promus
DES.
4. No complications.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. 2 vessel coronary artery disease with in stent restenosis of
RCA.
2. Successful PCI to the mRCA with Promus DES.
3. No complications.

ECHO [**12-30**]: preliminary only


Brief Hospital Course:
# Right coronary artery ST elevation myocardial infarction: S/P
RCA STEMI with succesful DES to site of in-stent thrombosis and
early resolution of EKG abnormalities. NO further chest pain,
CK's have downtrended. On BB, ACEi, statin, plavix and ASA. ECHO
with poor windows and no WMA, preserved EF on first read,
reviewed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who felt there was an inferior wall motion
abnormality with EF 45%. Appears euvolemic. Plan to continue
clopidogrel for 1 year/month for DES and likely forever. NP and
SW saw pt for her history of medicaton non-complience. She is
able to afford her medicines, just stated she was "stubborn" and
didn't feel that she needed the medicine anymore. Her diabetes
regimen is also onerous to her and she wishes it could be
simplified. She states she now realizes that she needs to take
her medications daily.

# RHYTHM: SR, no VEA
.
# Hyperlipidemia- high dose atorvastatin for now, change back to
rosuvastatin at discharge because of her history of myalgias on
high dose statin. She has [**Last Name (un) **] tolerati
