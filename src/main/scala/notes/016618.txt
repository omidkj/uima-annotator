Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2193-10-28**]: Cardiac catheterization with IABP placement then
Emergent coronary artery bypass grafting x4 with left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and reverse
saphenous vein and vein graft to the posterior descending
artery, the obtuse marginal artery, the ramus intermedius
artery.


History of Present Illness:
69 year old female presents with chest pain found to have non ST
elevation myocardial infarction. She was admitted on [**10-25**] after
having presented to an outside hospital with chest pain for
twelve hours, found to have elevated troponin and ECG changes.
She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.  Of note, over the last 3 weeks, she's also had
Shortness of breath and lower extremity edema. On presentation,
she was found to have hypoxia (80% RA) and she was thought to
have pulmonary edema.  Over the next few days, she was given
furosemide IV for diuresis with improvement of her hypoxia.
Referred to cardiac surgery for revascularization. She underwent
a cardiac catheterization [**10-28**] and the right coronary artery was
dissected in the process.  She went into respiratory distress
requiring intubation.  She had an intra-aortic balloon pump
inserted. Cardiac surgery was consulted for an emergent coronary
artery bypass grafting.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred into emergency department from [**Hospital3 **]
for chest pain management, was admitted to medicine.  She
underwent cardiac catheterization which she had coronary
dissection, resulting in IABP placement and transfer to the
operating room emergently for coronary artery bypass graft
surgery.  See operative and catheterization reports for further
details.  She received vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics
and was transfered to the intensive care unit for post operative
management. She had prolonged intubation due to volume overload
and pneumonia.  Her pneumonia was treated with intravenous
medications and was transitioned to oral.  She underwent
dialysis due to renal impairment, she had known chronic kidney
disease prior to surgery underwent cardiac catheterization and
surgery all in same day, however her kidney function improve and
last hemodialysis was [**11-3**], then quintin catheter was removed
[**11-6**].  She was able to be weaned and extubated after fluid
removal with dialysis and remains on nasal cannula after being
extubated on [**11-2**].  She continued to progress with no other
complications post operatively and was ready for discharge to
[**Hospital6 **] in [**Location (un) 246**] on [**11-6**] with continued treatment
for pneumonia, and plan for biweekly labs to monitor renal
function at rehab.
