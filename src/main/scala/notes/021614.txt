Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
CC: Mental status change, hypercarbic respiratory failure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiPAP

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68M h/o COPD, OSA and diabetic nephropathy found
on floor at home covered in urine and vomit. Unknown how long
down. According to daughter has been not taking any of his
medications recently (patient denies), and had turned up his
home O2 from his baseline 4L NC on [**2-12**] because he felt weak. He
has also been smoking (1 ppd) and using EtOH (reports 3 beers
per day; family found empty six-pack of beer in apartment).
Reports rhinorrhea but no sore throat, cough, myalgias, fevers,
chills, or sweats. Reports he was eating and drinking regularly.
No nausea or vomiting. Denies ankle edema, PND, or orthopnea.
.
In the ED, was afebrile and hemodynamically stable with BP
134/60, HR 80. He was minimally oriented but denying any
complaints. Blood gas showed severe acute respiratory acidosis
(7.10/112/146), and he was started on BIPAP. He was also given
SoluMedrol 125mg IV and albuterol/atrivent nebs. Subsequent
ABGs: 7.14/96/63, then 7.20/76/66. Also found to be in ARF with
BUN/Cr 68/4.2 (baseline Cr 2.0 in [**1-13**]) with hyperkalemia at K
6.2. He was started on fluids, given calcium gluconate, insulin
with glucose, and Kayexylate. F/u K 6 hours later was 6.5, and
these interventions were repeated. Head CT was unremarkable, and
CXR confirmed findings of COPD, but no acute cardiopulmonary
process.

Past Medical History:
1) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, no pulmonary function
test on record, on 3L NC at home (only with exertion).
2) Obstructive sleep apnea on BIPAP (settings = 12&6 on 8 L
oxygen.)
3) Type 2 diabetes (last A1C 6.4 on [**2179-1-26**]) c/b
biopsy-proven diabetic nephrosclerosis.
4) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on aspirin
5) Chronic renal insufficiency from diabetic nephropathy,
baseline Cr 2-2.5. Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
6) Gout
7) Anemia
8) Hypertension
9) Anxiety

Family History:
Non-contributory

Extr: No LE edema, 1+ DPs bilaterally
Neuro: sleepy, CN II-XII intact, moves all extremities


Pertinent Results:
CT head, non-contrast ([**2-15**]): This study is severely limited
secondary to patient motion artifact. There is no evidence of
mass, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, or
infarction. The density values of the brain parenchyma are
within normal limits. Once again there is prominent exophthalmos
which is unchanged significantly compared to [**2174-7-10**]. There is
bulging of the orbital septum bilaterally and also prominence of
the superior rectus muscle. The surrounding osseous, soft
tissues and paranasal sinuses are otherwise unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial pathology, including no
sign of
intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Again, prominent exophthalmos as described above but
unchanged compared to [**2174-7-10**]. Imaging findings consistent with
[**Doctor Last Name 933**] disease. Clinical correlation is recommended.
.
CXR ([**2-15**]):
FINDINGS: Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours are stable in
appearance from previous study. The aorta is calcified and
tortuous. The pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable.
Hyperexpanded lungs and flattened diaphragms are again noted,
consistent with history of COPD. There is no evidence of pleural
effusion. Allowing for technical limitations and patient motion,
as well as a metallic object overlying the extreme lung bases,
there is no evidence of pulmonary infiltrate.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pneumonia.
2. COPD.
.
KUB and upright ([**2-15**]):
ABDOMEN, SUPINE AND SEMIUPRIGHT. The right lateral abdomen is
excluded in the radiograph. Air mixed with stool is seen
throughout the colon to the level of the rectum. There are no
dilated loops of large or small bowel. No free air is seen
beneath the hemidiaphragms on the upright view. The lung bases
are grossly clear. Mild degenerative change is noted in the
lower lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION: Limited study. No definite obstruction or free
intraperitoneal air.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 69M h/o COPD, OSA, CRI presented with hypercarbic
respiratory failure, mental status changes, and acute on chronic
renal failure with hyperkalemia in the setting of likely poor
med compliance, tobacco and EtOH use, and self-increase home O2.

.
1) Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Per old records, baseline
ABG is 7.30/80/60. Initial ABG in ED (7.10/112/146) indicates
essentially pure acute respiratory acidosis overlying his
chronic respiratory acidosis. Differential diagnosis for his
acute illness includes COPD exacerbation [**3-12**] missing inhalers
(though no wheezing on exam), decreased respiratory drive from
turning up home O2, altered mental status [**3-12**] uremia from ARF.
Infection was not entirely ruled out, though no clear source,
and CXR clear.  He was initially managed on the general medicine
service, but was later transferred to the medical ICU service
after he was found to have paridoxical breathing, decreased air
movement and agitation.  Immediately prior to transfer, ativan
0.5 mg IV x 2 was given for an anxiety/withdrawl component of
his respiratory distress, and he subsequently became hypoxic to
high 80's with a pulse of 90, and BP 190/100. ABG on transfer to
the MICU was 7.12/93/71.  In MICU, he was bridged through acute
exacerbation with constant Bipap with treatment for acute COPD
exacerbation (e.g., nebulizer treatments, antibiotics, and
steroids).  He remained somnolent for initial MICU course
possibly secondary to benzodiazepines vs. hypercarbia. On
transfer to the floor his respiratory status was stable and he
was maintained on BIPAP at night and O2 NC with goal 02 sat of
88-92%. We continued his prednisone taper. He was discharged to
rehabilitation on a 7 day course of levofloxacin for presumed
pneumonia. He was continued on his advair and spiriva with prn
nebs.
.
2) Tachycardia:  Late in the MICU course, Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed
bouts of tachycardia to 140-150 that resolve quickly without
intervention.  EKG reviewed with cardiology fellow, who believes
this represents AVNRT vs. atrial flutter.  Also considered
albuterol side-effects; however, bouts of tachycardia persisted
long after albuterol held.  Of note, on [**2-19**], his metoprolol was
discontinued due to underlying bronchospastic lung disease, and
he was started on diltiazem, so beta-blocker withdrawl was also
considered. He was started on diltiazem ER and his dose was
increased to 360mg qday with good rate control.
.
3) Acute on chronic renal failure: FEUrea suggests prerenal
etiology, and Cr has been improving with hydration now
approaching baseline range (baseline 2-2.5). Probably [**3-12**]
dehydration stemming from decreased PO intake over last few days
(although patient denies). With hyperkalemia to 6.9 in ED,
(rec'd Ca/Gluc/HCO3) now down to 4.6. No ECG changes. His
creatinine returned to baseline on the floor and at discharge
his crt. was 2.7.
.
4) Altered mental status: Resolved with treatment of respiratory
failure. Etiology of his somnolence was hypercarbia vs.
iatrogenic [**3-12**] valium he received overnight per CIWA scale
implemented on admission. His mental status was much improved on
the floors.
.
5) EtOH: Last drink believed to be day PTA. Briefly used
conservative CIWA for some symptoms of withdrawal. Now no longer
evident. There was evidence of withdrawal during his stay.
.
6) DM2: pt. is diet controlled at home.  He was started on a
RISS during his stay as he was given predinisone for h
