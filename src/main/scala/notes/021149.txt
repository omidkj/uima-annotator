History of Present Illness:
82yo F with CAD s/p MI developed R foot weakness and pain
last evening, called her daughter at 2am.  She noted the foot to
appear pale, feel cool, and absent pulses.  Brought to [**Hospital3 9683**] where noted pulmonary infiltrate c/w PNA, rx'd
Levaquin,
and obtained Head CT (reportedly negative).  Upon transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**], CTA obtained and vascular surgery subsequently consulted.

Pt currently reports constant pain in R foot.  No prior
episodes.

ROS: recent cough/URI symptoms, with mild dyspnea currently. no
CP or palpitations.  no HA or dizziness.  no dysuria.  no
history
of CVA, remote h/o gastric ulcer

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 9201**] was seen by our vascular surgical service in the ER
on [**2141-5-28**], and was diagnosed with occlusion of both of her
superficial femoral arteries resulting in RLE ischemia.  She was
started on a heparin drip and bolus, and taken to the operating
room emergently, where an angiojet thrombectomy of the right SFA
and popliteal thrombus and R SFA stent was placed and
angioplasty performed on the R BK poplitial arteria and AT
artery and a lysis catheter was placed in the bk [**Doctor Last Name **] / AT.  She
was continued on her TPA and low dose
heparin drip, and transferred to the CVICU.  She was found to
have a pulseless L foot, so her sheath was downgraded to a 5Fr
sheath, the lysis catheter was removed and the TPA was stopped
and full dose heparin was started with immediate return of
doppler signals to her foot after the sheath change.  Her
troponin also increased dramatically, and the cardiology service
was consulted.

She was found to have a L common iliac artery rupture on [**5-29**] and
taken back to the operating room emergently on [**2141-5-29**] for
treatment of a retroperitoneal bleed, b/l iliac stent grafts,
b/l CFA repairs, left SFA embolectomy, and an aortic stent.
Given her recent esophageal dilatation for CREST syndrome she
was not a candidate for TEE and underwent a TTE which showed no
apical thrombus.  She was presumed to have either left atrial
thrombus (as she had evidence of likely bilateral lower
extremity embolization and had a history of palpitations with
multiple prior holter monitors) or a severe prothrombotic state
with hypoperfusion/dehydration related to MI and CHF as the
etiologic event.  However, given her severe hemorrhage we
elected to proceed without heparin at this time.

 She remained anemic, requiring multiple units of PRBC, and
developed evidence of shock liver.  On [**2141-6-1**] she developed
rapid AFib, and was started on an amiodarone drip. Her L hand
was noted to be acutely ischemic, and she was taken back to the
OR, where brachial artery exploration revealed no evidence of
thrombus or embolus.

Renal was consulted for her gradually rising creatinine, and
determined that she likely had contrast and
hypoperfusion-related ATN, and would likely need dialysis.  The
family, who remained quite involved throughout her hospital
stay, decided that she would not have wanted to undergo a
prolonged hospital stay or dialysis, with likely chronic nursing
home care to follow, and as her renal failure and liver failure
continued to worsen, decided to withdraw care on [**2141-6-3**].
