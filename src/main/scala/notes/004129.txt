HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 6993**] is an 81-year-old
right-handed male with bilateral total knee replacement, hip
fractures, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin, congestive heart failure.  His family brought
patient in for mental status changes of three or four day-
duration, mainly "he was slow when speaking, answering their
questions".  They brought him to an outside hospital where a
CT scan revealed bilateral subdural collections,
subfalcial herniation, and a parasagittal hemangioma. Patient
also had high INR.  Coumadin was discontinued and he was given 6
units of fresh-frozen plasma to reverse INR.  He was sent here
for Neurosurgical evaluation, but they felt these collections
were old and did not require intervention. Therefore, Neurology
was consulted.  The patient had an episode of desreased LOC on
the floor.  The patient was then admitted to Intensive Care Unit,
and given mannitol x1 to decrease edema.  He had a
repeat CT which showed no significant change.  Neurosurgery
discussed options with family, and he was deemed not to be a
surgical candidate.

On examination when seen on the general floor, the patient
had a blood pressure of 140/60, heart rate of 60, temperature
of 100.8, and respiratory rate of 18.  On physical exam,
pertinent positives:  The patient had an irregular rhythm
with a positive S1, S2.  There are no carotid bruits.  Lungs
were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Patient had no
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema with 2+ dorsalis pedis.

On neurologic examination, the patient had an appropriate
affect.  Was oriented to name, but did not know the hospital.
Thought the date was [**6-22**].  Was unable to identify year
and he was mildly inattentive.  The patient did have slow
fluent speech.  Repetition and naming were intact.  The
patient was able to read and write.  Memory was [**3-8**]
registration, 0/3 consolidation.  The patient had no apraxia,
neglect to frontal signs.  On cranial nerve examination,
visual fields were intact to confrontation.  Pupils are round
from 2 mm to 1.5 mm bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are
intact without nystagmus.  Patient had normal facial
sensation and musculature.  Hearing intact to finger rub.
Patient had normal tone and bulk.  Patient had 4+ iliopsoas
and quadriceps, otherwise 5+.  Patient had 2+ reflexes aside
from triceps 1.  On sensory examination, the patient had a
negative Romberg with decreased proprioception, vibration,
and temperature below shins bilaterally, otherwise intact
sensation.  The patient had no dysmetria on finger-to-nose.

LABORATORIES AND TESTS:  The patient had white blood cells
[**11-19**] over the past five days with 75% neutrophils.
Patient's INR was controlled.  Patient had a BUN and
creatinine of 37/2.1, which was rechecked daily.  Patient
also had a repeat head CT and MRI which showed redemonstration of
bilateral subdural hematoma with left frontal parasagittal
meningioma.  He also had an EEG, which did not show seizure
activity.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL STAY:  Coumadin was discontinued
with only aspirin for atrial fibrillation and beta blocker
for hypertension with digoxin.  Beta blockers were later
discontinued because of asymptomatic bradycardia (~ 30s). Patient
also had positive MRSA in heel which was treated during
admission.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1- Subdural hematomas
2- Left frontal meningioma.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Glipizide 10 mg q am/5 mg q hs.
2. Aspirin 325 mg q day.
3. Digoxin 0.25 mg po q day.
