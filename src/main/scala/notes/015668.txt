Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Elective heart catheterization.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old man with a
past medical history of coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft in [**2163-3-30**], end-stage
renal disease (on hemodialysis since [**2164-5-29**]), renal cell
carcinoma with positive metastases, type 2 diabetes, who
presented to the Coronary Care Unit after an elective cardiac
catheterization for preoperative evaluation for possible
future nephrectomy after a Persantine MIBI in [**2164-4-29**]
showed moderate partially reversible inferior and apical
perfusion defects, mild partially reversible later wall
defect, global hypokinesis, with an ejection fraction of 37%.
The patient had original cardiac catheterization in [**2163-3-1**] with subsequent coronary artery bypass graft in [**2163-3-30**] with saphenous vein grafts to left anterior
descending artery, posterior descending artery, and diagonal
with pericardiectomy.  The patient did well.  Never
complained of any chest pain, and was doing well until
Persantine MIBI in [**2164-4-29**] when preoperative revealed
the aforementioned defects.

The patient was preopped for possible future nephrectomy
after a CT scan showed possible abdominal metastases.  He had
a cardiac catheterization on [**8-17**] showing left main
coronary artery disease diffusely at 30%, left anterior
descending artery of 70% proximally, 50% mid, 80% large
diagonal, 90% mid diagonal occlusions, and left circumflex
90% proximal, right coronary artery occluded proximally.  The
patient had rotablation into the diagonal, stent to the mid
diagonal and original diagonal, stent to the original left
anterior descending artery.  Left circumflex stenting was
postponed until Monday.  The patient had some increased
shortness of breath during the procedure.  He was given Lasix
and sent to the floor.  At this time he had gone into 2:1
heart block.

On presentation to the Coronary Care Unit the patient
appeared in no apparent distress.  He states he has some
shortness of breath at baseline.  He is able to walk one to
two flights and walk half a mile.  No chest pain.  He is
limited by shortness of breath.  The patient states shortness
of breath is better after dialysis.  The patient also noticed
to have intermittent 2:1 heart block after this cardiac
catheterization, ectopic atrial fossae, and occasional wide
complex response.  He was given 1 amp of calcium gluconate
and went to a short course of hemodialysis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2163-3-30**], triple bypass with saphenous
vein graft to left anterior descending artery, posterior
descending artery and diagonal with pericardiectomy.
2.  End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis since [**2164-5-29**].
3.  Renal cell carcinoma with positive metastases, status
post nephrectomy diagnosed in [**2153**].
4.  Increased cholesterol.
5.  Type 2 diabetes.
6.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications on admission included
aspirin, Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d., Nephrocaps 1 p.o. q.d.,
glyburide 2.5 mg p.o. q.d., Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.,
Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d., Ativan p.r.n., and Coreg 12.5 mg
p.o. b.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  Allergies include CT SCAN CONTRAST and MORPHINE.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father with coronary artery disease, died at
age 82.  Mother with ovarian cancer.  Sister with liver
cancer.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco.  No alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Generally, this was a
pleasant male in no apparent distress.  Vital signs were
pulse 70, blood pressure 118/57, pulse oximetry 99,
respiratory rate 22.  HEENT revealed pupils were equal, round
and reactive to light and accommodation.  Moist mucous
membranes.  Neck with right Quinton catheter in place.  No
jugular venous pressure appreciated.  Cardiovascular had a
regular rate and rhythm, S1/S2.  There was a 3/6 systolic
murmur at the left lower sternal border which radiated to the
axilla.  Lungs were clear bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities had trace edema bilaterally.  No calf tenderness.
Neurologic examination revealed cranial nerves II through XII
were grossly intact.  The patient was alert and oriented
times three, mentated well.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  He had a white blood cell count
of 5, hematocrit of 28.5, platelets of 158.  Chem-7 revealed
sodium of 131, potassium of 5, chloride 93, bicarbonate 20,
BUN of 34, creatinine of 5.4, glucose of 186.


RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm
with intermittent 2:1 heart block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   This is a 73-year-old man with a past
medical history of coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft, type 2 diabetes, renal cell
carcinoma with metastases, now status post cardiac
catheterization, status post intermittent heart block.  The
patient was dialyzed for a short course on [**8-17**].  The
patient was restarted on his beta blocker and an ACE
inhibitor was added.  Per report, all of his saphenous vein
grafts from his prior coronary artery bypass graft were now
down.

On [**8-18**], the patient was started on a low dose of
captopril 6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d.  His Coreg was titrated down
to 6.25 mg p.o. b.i.d. in the setting of possible heart
failure, and the patient was set to go for stent of his left
circumflex on Monday.

The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm throughout his
stay.  The patient ruled in for a non-Q-wave myocardial
infarction status post catheterization on [**8-17**], with a
creatine kinase of 407, and a MB of 76, with an index of 19.
On [**8-19**], the patient's captopril was increased to 12.5 mg
p.o. t.i.d.  He was kept on aspirin, Plavix, and Lipitor.

On [**8-21**], the patient went for a follow-up cardiac
catheterization where the proximal left anterior descending
artery was stented, first obtuse marginal was stented, and
rescue angioplasty was performed on the left circumflex.
Other impressions at this cardiac catheterization were
2-vessel coronary artery disease and severe pulmonary
hypertension.  The patient also had an electrophysiology
study for the 2:1 heart block which ended up being negative,
and no pacemaker was installed.

Renal revealed the patient underwent regular scheduled
hemodialysis through a right Quinton catheter throughout his
stay without complications.

Hematology revealed the patient continued to be anemic with
hematocrits in the 28 to 30 range.  Iron studies were sent.
The patient had an iron of 25, a TIBC of 172, a ferritin
of 323.  This was possibly consistent with anemia of chronic
disease.  Per renal, the patient is on high doses of Epogen,
and they recommended he start iron 325 mg p.o. t.i.d. which
the patient went on.

Endocrinology revealed the patient had a diagnosis of type 2
diabetes.  As an inpatient the patient had his glyburide held
and was started on a insulin sliding-scale.  As soon as the
patient's appetite increased, he was started on his
glyburide 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. to good affect, and blood sugars
remained in the 90 to 130 range.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was transferred from the
Coronary Care Unit to Far Three on [**8-19**] where he remained
until discharge.

CODE STATUS:  Full code.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  No change in code status.  The patient is
full code.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post stent.
2.  Type 2 diabetes.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Iron deficiency anemia.
5.  End-stage renal disease.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
