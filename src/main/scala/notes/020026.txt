Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Increased shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right heart catheterization on [**2194-12-4**].

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 66 year old woman with a history of CAD (status
post MI in [**2186**] and [**2191**]), dilated cardiomyopathy, and CHF (EF
20-25% in [**2186**], 50% in [**2191**], 35% in setting of moderate to
severe MR), who presented for a scheduled ECHO appointment today
with two weeks of increasing shortness of breath.  Patient had
been hospitalized in [**2194-10-1**] for a CHF exacerbation, but
the symptoms, currently, are not nearly as severe.  She endorses
8 pillow orthopnea, PND, and decreased ability to sleep over the
past several weeks.  She denies any chest pain, palpitations, or
abdominal pain.  She endorses an infrequent cough, productive of
green sputum.  She denies any recent weight gain or pedal edema.
 She also denies altering her diet over the holidays, as her
daughter prepares her meals and is "careful not to use too much
salt."  She states that her exercise tolerance has not changed
markedly since [**Month (only) **].  She can climb one flight of stairs,
but only does so once a night.  She can go to the supermarket
and push a cart through the aisles.
Patient is a direct transfer from outpatient clinic and is
scheduled to be evaluated for an AICD or mitral valve
replacement, after patient diuresed.
On review, patient denies any previous sick contacts,
hemoptysis, fevers, chills, or rigors.

Pertinent Results:
Right cardiac cath ([**2194-12-4**]):  Patient noted to have wedge of 36,
RA 15, PA 55, RVED 22, CI 3.25.
.
EKG([**2194-12-3**]):  Sinus rhythm of 85.  Left axis.  Left bundle
branch noted.  Could not appreciate any ST segment elevations.
.
EF ([**2194-12-3**]):  EF 35%.  The left atrium is mildly dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior
akinesis. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
[Intrinsic left  ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Tissue
synchronization imaging demonstrates no significant left
ventricular dyssynchrony. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate to severe ([**1-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction
(regional) without significant left ventricular dyssynchrony.
Mild aortic stenosis. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
.
[**2194-12-5**] Renal U/S:  IMPRESSION:
1. No hydronephrosis.
2. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
.
[**2194-12-9**] Vein mapping: IMPRESSION: Patent bilateral subclavian
veins and bilateral brachial arteries. Although both cephalic
and basilic veins are patent, they are all less than 0.20 cm.
.
[**2194-12-9**] ECHO: Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D  or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal to mid inferior
wall. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely
more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally
increased
gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a small
circumferential (0.6 cm) pericardial effusion.
.
[**2194-12-9**] Right heart cath: COMMENTS:     1. Resting hemodynamics
revealed mildly elevated mean PCPW
of 15mmHg. Cardiac index was normal at 3.8 l/min/m2.
.
[**2194-12-12**] Carotid artery u/s: IMPRESSION: Minimal plaque with
bilateral less than 40% carotid stenosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
66 year old woman with CAD, status post MI in [**2186**] and [**2191**],
moderate MR, EF 35%, and CHF who was hospitalized in [**Month (only) **]
[**2193**] for CHF exacerbation, who presented for a scheduled
appointment today and was noted to have increased shortness of
breath over the past two weeks.  Admitted for fluid management
of CHF and potential MVR and/or ICD.
.
#) CHF:
The patient was noted to have an EF of 35% on [**2194-12-3**], in setting
of moderate MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] has had increasing shortness of breath
in the past several weeks.  She denies any chest pain or
palpitations.  She denies any noncompliance with her diet as an
outpatient and denies any recent weight gain or increased lower
extremity swelling. Right heart cath on [**2194-12-4**] revealted a wedge
pressure of 36, RA 15, PA 55, and a CI 3.25.  She was
aggressively diuresed with lasix despite her acute on chronic
renal failure.  A repeat right heart cath on [**2194-12-9**] revealed
much improved hemodynamics with a wedge pressure of 15 with a CI
of 3.8.  She was continued on hydralazine, isosorbide and
amlodipine.  An ECHO on [**2194-12-9**] showed 3+MR and mild AS with an
LVEF of 30-40%.  She was consulted by CT surgery for possible
MVR.  She had preop labs drawn and carotid U/S which showed
bilateral less than 40% stenosis.  She will also need a left
heart cath prior to surgery.  This will be scheduled for next
week and she will return the night before for pre-cath
hydration.  Dr.[**Name (NI) 1565**] office will contact her when the
exact date is established.  She may also need a BiV ICD in the
future as a preventative measure.
.
#) CAD:  known CAD s/p MI in [**2186**] and [**2191**].
She had no active ischemia during this admission.  She was
continued on aspiri
