History of Present Illness:
PC: Mark Denoyers, [**Location (un) 5503**]

This is an 80 yo man with recent discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] ([**11-19**])
after stay on surgery service for splenic abcess/splenectomy c/b
colonic enterocutaneous fistula with recent abdominal fluid
collection drained by IR who re-presents from rehab ([**Hospital1 **])
with worsening abdominal distension. During his last admit grew
bacteroides from abdomen and pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas
from sputum (treated with 2 weeks of [**Last Name (un) 2830**], tobra, bactrim, and
fluc). Currently he has no complaints. He feels well. He notes
foley has been indwelling for a long time. He notes no dizziness
or lightheadedness on standing and does not feel thirsty. He
denies abdominal pain, distension, nausea, vomitting, fevers,
chills, constipation (had 3 days, resolved 3 days ago with
diarrhea), last bm [**12-3**] normal without blood or melena. He has
stable/baseline (per him) cough productive of white sputum (no
blood) and intermittent sob not related to exertion (has not
been out of bed much at rehab). He denies pain at sacral decub,
ventral abdominal wound, or tube sites. He has not eaten by
mouth since discharge.

In the ED: VS: T 98.5 HR 110->107 112/78 18 97% on RA. He was
seen by surgery and felt to have stable abdominal CT, but there
was a read of ? enhancing fluid collection in thorax, IP
consulted and plan to place drain. Still with abdominal drain in
place until follow up with [**Doctor Last Name **] on [**12-8**]. He was given 1.5L
Ns.

ROS: 10 point review of systems negative except as noted above.

(Select studies, as patient has numerous images from this
hospitalization)
CT [**2132-9-18**]:
1. Heterogeneous predominantly enhancing expansile lesion in the

posteromedial spleen consistent with either an intrasplenic
lesion, such as hemangioma, with extra- splenic hemorrhage or
intrasplenic contusion and extra-splenic hemorrhage.

CT [**2132-10-25**]
1. Patient is status post splenectomy. A small rim-enhancing
fluid
collection is noted in the post-splenectomy bed measuring 3.9 x
2.5 cm.
2. Small amount of free air noted along the left lateral
anterior aspect of the abdomen, likely due to recent JP drain
removal upon discussion with the surgical resident.
3. Focal area of small bowel wall thickening within the mid
lower abdomen,
which may represent a focal segment of enteritis.
4. Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to 4.7 cm.
5. Bilateral small pleural effusions.
6. Cholelithiasis.

CT [**2132-12-9**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged left-sided pneumothorax and left thoracic wall
subcutaneous
emphysema.
2. Bilateral pneumonia and consolidations.
3. Pneumatosis within the descending colon without bowel
thickening or other features of ischemic colitis. Other
considerations include air tracking from adjacent drains or
subcutaneous emphysema.
4. Foley catheter ending within the prostate.
5. Resolution of anterior abdominal wall collection.
6. Slight increase in size of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
