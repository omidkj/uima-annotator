new-onset symptoms of dysphagia while trying to swallow pills.
Given patient's new-onset dysphagia, smoking history, and CT

endoscopy with biopsy and dilatation of distal esophagus, which
demonstrated a normal-appearing esophagus. Upon returning home
s/p endoscopy, patient noted severe left lower sternal pain and
was then admitted to the hospital. On first day of admission,
patient had hematochezia and Hct dropped from ?? to 25. A second
endoscopy was performed which demonstrated a esophageal mucosal
tear and treated with epinephrine. Patient reports having had
third endoscopy on day of admission, which demonstrated no
further bleeding.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 82 yo female with pmhx significant for atrial
fibrillation, bladder cancer s/p BCG rx, CAD, HTN who presented
for further follow-up and treatment of esophageal bleed s/p
endoscopy and resulting esophageal tear on [**2108-8-2**].
.
1. Esophageal Bleed - Patient developed esophageal bleed s/p
upper GI endoscopy on [**2108-8-2**], although endoscopy on [**2108-8-5**] did
not demonstrate continued bleeding. On second day of admission,
patient continued to report maroon stools and had several
episodes of hemoptysis. Patient was transferred to MICU for
urgent upper GI endoscopy, which demonstrated an adherent clot
in the distal esophagus at 38cm without any active bleeding. A
repeat EGD on [**8-8**] demonstrated a large 2cm x 1cm esophageal
mucosal tear on the posterior wall with adherent clot at 38 cm
at the proximal end of the tear. The clot was removed and some
blood was seen at the base. [**Hospital1 **]-CAP Electrocautery was applied
for hemostasis successfully. She was maintained on IV PPI with
stable Hct checked q6 for the next 30 hours. Her Hct was stable
upon discharge, she was tolerating a regular diet and po pain
meds.
.
2. Mediastinal LAD - Patient's initial presentation of dysphagia
was most likely secondary to mediastinal LAD with unclear
etiology. Differential diagnosis includes lymphoma, primary lung
cancer, or recurrence of prior cancer. CT of the chest at [**Hospital1 18**]
demonstrated large LAD in the mediastinum and chest. It is not
clear to us if this a new process or an old process that has
been stable. We attempted to contact her PCP regarding this, but
were unsuccessful. In any case, she needs a follow-up CT of the
chest in [**3-2**] months. If there is any change in the
lymphadenopathy, she may need further work-up by biopsy or
bronchopscopy.
.
3. Atrial Fibrillation - Patient has a history of atrial
fibrillation. She was previously on coumadin but was
discontinued in [**2095**] after bladder cancer for unclear reasons.
Patient was maintained on telemetry, without any events. She was
not maintained on digoxin here as her rate was well controlled
with low-dose BB.
.
4. MDS w/ thrombocypenia: baseline plts in the 80s and has
remained stable, receives procrit as outpatient to maintain Hct.
She was given Procrit here prior to discharge and is to
follow-up with her PCP for outpatient dosing.
.
5. CAD s/p MI - Not on ASA at home given MDS as above. Continue
low-dose BB. Restart ACE-I as outpatient.
.
6. HTN - on low-dose BB. Holding Hyzaar, given recent acute
events. Plan to restart as outpatient.
.
7. COPD - continue nebs, no active issues
.
