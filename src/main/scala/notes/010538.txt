Pertinent Results:
[**2114-3-1**] Cardiac Cath: 1.  Selective coronary angiography in this
right dominant system demonstrated no angiographically apparent
CAD.  The LMCA, LAD, LCx and RCA were normal. 2.  Left
ventriculography was deferred. 3.  Resting hemodynamics
demonstrated elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
RVEDP was 25 mmHg and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 40
mmHg.  There was severe pulmonary arterial hypertension with a
PA pressure of 82/40 mmHg.  Central aortic pressure was
low-normal at 102/75 mmHg.  Cardiac index was low at 1.4
l/min/m2.
[**2114-3-4**] LE U/S: No evidence of right lower extremity DVT.
[**2114-3-5**] Echo: The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%) although intrinsic
function is more depressed given severity of mitral
regurgitation. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue
synchronization maging demonstrates no significant left
ventricular dyssynchrony; however cannot exclude since images
were technically suboptimal. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
[**2114-3-12**] Echo: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. There is
no mitral stenosis. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2114-3-5**], a mitral valve ring is now identified with marked
decrease in the severity of mitral regurgitation. The left
atrial and left ventricular cavity sizes are now smaller. The
severity of pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is also
reduced. Global left ventricular systolic function is now
depressed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted under medicine/cardiology service for
evaluation of her ICD. She underwent a cardiac cath on [**3-1**]
which revealed clean coronaries with severe pulmonary
hypertension. An LV gram was deferred d/t her increased
Creatinine. She was started on heparin for anticoagulation for
her atrial fibrillation (Coumadin was stopped). She was seen be
EP service for ICD management, as was well as cardiac surgery
for mitral valve repair. She was medically managed over the next
several days and her creatine trended down. During this time she
underwent another echocardiogram which revealed a normal EF with
3+ MR. On [**3-6**] she was taken to the operating room and underwent
a mitral valve repair with LV lead placement (for biventricular
pacing). Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Later on op day she was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. She
initially required some inotropes which were slowly weaned off.
EP service continued to follow patient and interrogate her ICD,
post-operatively she was in atrial fibrillation. Chest tubes
were removed on post-op day two. Beta blockers and diuretics
were started per protocol. She was gently diuresed towards her
pre-op weight and Lopressor was titrated for maximal
hemodynamics. On post-op day four chest tubes were removed and
Coumadin was started (already started on Heparin). An ACE
inhibitor was added and she was transferred to the telemetry
floor on post-op day seven. She continued to work with the
physical therapy service daily. She was gently diuresed towards
her preoperative weight. Ms. [**Known lastname **] continued to make steady
progress and was discharged home on [**2114-3-16**]. She will follow-up
with the electrophysiology service, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her cardiologist
and her primary care physician as an outpatient.
