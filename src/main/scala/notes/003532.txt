Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PREBYPASS
A mass consistent with a myxoma or tumor is seen in the body of
the left atrium along the lower anteroseptal area of the
interatrialo septum. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen
ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with
maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen
(within normal limits).

POSTBYPASS
There is preserved biventricular systolic function. The LA mass
is no longer visualized. The interatrial septum is intact by 2d,
Color Doppler and by agitated saline at rest and with Valsalva
manuever. The study is otherwise unchanged compared to
prebypass.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

to the CVICU in stable condition on phenylephrine and propofol
drips. Extubated that evening.
Given first dose of lopressor 12.5mg and developed bradycardia
w/ HR 30's. Paced until recovered -in junctional rhythm
60's-70's. Chest tubes d/c'd w/ stable CXR.
transferred from the ICU to the floor.  Rhythm converted to
sinus.  The patient made excellent progress on the floor,
showing good strength and balance with physical therapy.  Pacing
wires were discontinued without incident.  She was discharged in
good condition to home on POD 4 with appropriate follow up
instructions.
