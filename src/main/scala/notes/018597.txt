Brief Hospital Course:
1. CV: Pt was admitted with stable hemodynamics on [**2188-10-15**].  She
has been in atrial fibrillation since that time. Exam has shown
a stable III/VI SEM. Lungs have been clear to auscultation and
she has had no lower extremity edema or increased JVP. Pt was
taken off of Coumadin and started on heparin gtt upon admission
and was taken to CT surgery on [**2188-10-22**] to replace her prosthetic
aortic valve.
2. ID: Pt had originally had her surgery delayed due to molar
abscess and a elevated WBC which remained high for weeks as she
was treated with antibiotics. Upon admission, she had no signs
of molar abscess and between admission and surgery she was
afebrile without focal signs of infection. Her WBC was elevated
on [**10-21**] to 11.7 and then 14.8, but was WNL at 10.8 on the day of
surgery.
3. Renal: Patient's creatinine was consistently in the 1.0-1.3
range from admission until day of surgery.
4. Pulm: Patient has a hx of COPD but experienced no SOB from
admission until day of surgery.
5. DM: Patient's blood glucose on CMP ranged from 121 to 227
from admission until day of surgery. Her Metformin was
discontinued on [**2188-10-20**] and she was started on ISS in
preparation for her surgery.

Taken to the operating room on [**2188-10-22**] for an aortic valve
replacement and mitral valve replacement.  After the valves were
placed, she suffered a catastrophic separation of her LA from
her LV after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass.  Please see
the operative note for detail of surgical events.  She went back
on bypass, and had an LVAD placed.  She was admitted to the CSRU
from the OR late that evening in critical condition.  She had
significant bleeding problems, and was re-explored at the
bedside a number of times during her course.  She remained on
inotropes and pressors,  received multiple units of blood
products, and her condition ultimately began to stabilize.  On
[**10-30**], she was noted to have increasing acidosis, and became
aneuric.  CVVH was initiated, and her abdomen was explored at
the bedside by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].  Her bowel was ischemic, and her
abdomen was left open.  The following day, her acidosis remained
profound, and she was taken for angiography of her SMA.  This
showed no acute clot, but rather diffuse spasm.  Papaverine
intra-arterial infusion was begun.  By the following morning,
[**11-1**], she'd continued to deteriorate.  Her acidosis had
worsened.  Her LVAD flows began to decrease. She ultimately
became bradycardic, which progressed to asystole.  She was
pronounced dead at 1115 on [**2188-11-1**].
