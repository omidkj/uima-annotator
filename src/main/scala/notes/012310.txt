Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**]
Chief Complaint:
Fvers, admitted from rehab


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67 yoM trached, h/o
Pseudomonas/Acineterbacter MDR PNA who is admitted from [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab with T 102.4 and altered MS.  Of note, he was recently
admitted at [**Hospital1 18**] MICU green from [**Date range (1) 95399**]/09 for similar system
of complaints; he was followed closely by ID and has been on a
course of amikacin/inhaled colistin for MDR PNA.  His course was
complicated by ARF thought to be [**2-6**] colistin side effect and
persistent fevers, for which no cause other than the PNA was
ever identified (numerous BCx were negative).
.
His wife reports that he was doing well this week at rehab with
improving MS.  It is unclear whether he was still having
intermittent fevers throughout the week, but this morning he
spiked and became less arousable.  He was noted to have thick
secretions.  ABG from 3:45 this afternoon showed 7.41/53/101 on
50% trach collar.  He had a set of BCx from [**1-26**] that are NGTD.

In the ED on arrival, VS were T, HR 108, BP 120/60, RR 24, RA
100%.  Head CT was negative for acute hemorrhage/edema, though
there is some question of mastoiditis b/l on the prelim read.
The ED staff touched base with ID who said to leave him on
amikacin/colistin.  He got a dose of amikacin 750 mg IV x 1.

CXR [**2169-1-28**]:
IMPRESSION: 1. Retrocardiac opacity may reflect atelectasis.
2. Extensive pleural and parenchymal scarring with pleural
calcifications,
unchanged.

CT Head w/o contrast [**2169-1-28**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
2. Bilateral opacification of mastoid air cells without osseous
destruction.
3. Small amount of fluid in the sphenoid and right maxillary
sinus

ECG [**2169-1-28**]:
Sinus tachycardia. Possible left ventricular hypertrophy (lead
aVL).
Non-specific inferolateral T wave flattening. Non-specific
intraventricular conduction delay. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2169-1-11**] the ventricular premature beat is absent and
there is increased QRS voltage. Sinus tachycardia and T wave
flattening are new.

ECHO [**2168-2-1**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis
of the mid to distal septum. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is a probable vegetation on
the aortic valve. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area
1.0cm2). Significant aortic regurgitation is present, but cannot
be quantified. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral valve,
but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-1-4**],
the severity of aortic stenosis is similar. There seems to be a
calcified leaflet that is more mobile than seen in the prior
echo, possible vegetation. A transesophageal echocardiographic
examination is recommended to further evaluate the aortic valve.


CT Chest/ABD/Pelvis [**2169-2-3**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No definite cause for persistent fevers is noted aside from
atelectasis/pleural plaques/scarring within the lungs,
particularly at the
dependent bases. These may in part be secondary to changes
related to prior asbestos exposure. Overall, the appearance of
the lungs is actually improved when compared to prior imaging
from [**2168-11-5**].
  2. No evidence of abscess or infection within the abdomen or
pelvis, although assessment is somewhat limited without IV
contrast and due to streak artifact from patient's arm
positioning.
