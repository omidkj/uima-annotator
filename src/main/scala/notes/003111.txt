Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Cephalosporins / Theophylline / Prevacid

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1481**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain with BRBPR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Total abdominal colectomy and ileostomy ([**2117-9-15**])
Tracheostomy ([**2117-9-22**])


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 75F with oxygen depended COPD and T2DM on insulin,
who was treated at OSH with levaquin from [**Date range (1) 25729**] for [**Date range (1) 25730**]
pneumonia. She was discharged home and was doing well until
yesterday afternoon when she began experiencing sudden left
sided
abdominal pain with nausea/vomiting and bloody diarrhea.

She was evaluated at OSH ED, where on presentation she was
afebrile, with SBPs 170s and HR 71. WBC was elevated at 24.4,
with 78% PMNs, 8% Bands. LFTs were normal, lactate 2.8. KUB
showed no evidence of free air, CT ab/pelvis showed fluid loops
in the small bowel and colon with wall thickening transverse and
descending colon, and atherosclerotic calcifications throughout
the abdominal aorta with apparent decreased flow throughout the
celiac axis. The surgery and ID services were consulted, and
were
concerned for ischemic vs. infectious colitis (given her recent
levaquin use for pna). Prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she received
100 mg stress dose steroids, IV levaquin and flagyl x 1 this
morning, and zosyn IV x1 this afternoon.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2117-9-22**] 3:10 AM
FINDINGS: Single AP view of the chest shows an ET tube to be 4.8
cm above the carina. An OG tube courses over the esophagus and
off the screen past the GE junction. A right IJ catheter tip
terminates in the low SVC. Unchanged small bilateral pleural
effusions and left basilar atelectasis. Increasing opacity at
the right lung base likely represents gravitational edema
recurrence of aspiration in the right clinical setting should be
considered. Cardiac silhouette remains large. No pneumothorax.
Aortic calcifications noted.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2117-9-29**] 4:32 AM
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-28**], the monitoring
and support
devices remain in good position. Continued opacification at the
left base is consistent with atelectasis and effusion. Little
overall change in the degree of pulmonary vascular congestion.
The patient has taken a somewhat better inspiration.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2117-9-16**] at 12:40:22 PM
Small, hyperdynamic left ventricle with mid-cavitary pressure
gradient. Dilated right ventricle. No clinically significant
valvular regurgitation or stenosis. Mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Very small pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2114-1-5**],
the left ventricle is now small and hyperdynamic with a
mid-cavity pressure gradient identified. Right ventricular
dilitation is now seen. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension is present on the current study and was not
previously assessed.

Pathology Examination ([**2117-9-15**])

I. Right and transverse colon, open colectomy, A-M:

1. Patchy mucosal and focal transmural necrosis.

2. Ileal and colonic resection margins free of necrosis.

3. Status post appendectomy.

4. See note.

II. Splenic flexure, ascending and descending colon, open
colectomy, N-Y and AB:

1. Patchy mucosal and focal submucosal necrosis with focal
transmural acute inflammation.

2. Mucosal necrosis present at one resection margin.

3. The other resection margin free of necrosis.

III. Terminal ileum, open colectomy, Z-AA: Patchy mucosal
necrosis at stapled end; see note.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs [**Known lastname 25731**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2117-9-15**] with severe
abdominal pain and bright red blood per rectum concerning for
ischemic vs infectious colitis and was taken emergently to the
operating room for an exploratory laparotomy, total abdominal
colectomy and end-ileostomy. The patient was trensferred to the
surgical ICU post-op for close monitoring, where she remained
throughout her hospital stay.

Neuro: the patient was sedated on propofol and intermittent
fentanyl and midazolam while intubated.  After tracheostomy was
placed, the patient's sedation was weaned to intermittent
fentanyl and ativan only.

CVS: the patient required pressors post-op and was successfully
weaned off within 24 hrs from her operation, and given albumin
and pRBCs for fluid status and blood pressure support.

Resp: the patient remained intubated until POD2, when she was
extubated but subsequently became tachypneic with desaturation,
and required re-intubation.  A second attempt at extubation was
made on POD5, but she again experienced desaturations with RLL
mucous plugging suggestive of possible aspiration event.  She
was again re-intubated at this time.  Sputum cultures grew ESBL
E.Coli organisms, and she was started on meropenem for a 14 day
course.  A decision was made to proceed with tracheostomy, and
she received a bedside trach on [**2117-9-22**].  She tolerated this
well, and was weaned to pressure support and eventually to
intermittent trach collar, with rest periods on the ventilator.

GI/FEN: the patient was NPO on IVF with an NGT in place post-op.
 She was started on tube feeds on POD4 with a concentrated
formula, which was eventually switched to Replete (currently at
goal rate of 55 cc/hr).

GU: urine output was closely monitored post-op. Her creatinine
initially increased to 1.3 from a baseline of 1 and went back to
baseline on POD1.  Her Cr remained stable throughout her stay,
and her BUN rose in the postoperative period but then returned
to baseline.  She was started on Lasix 20 [**Hospital1 **] on POD2 due to
fluid third-spacing, and was eventually transitioned to her home
dose of 80mg daily via her NGT.  This dose was decreased to
lasix 40 daily on [**2117-9-29**] and she was started on diamox due to a
rising CO2 level.

Heme: the patient received 1U of PRBC o
