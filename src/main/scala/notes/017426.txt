History of Present Illness:
74 yr old woman with hx of afib/flutter, tachy-brady syndrome
s/p [**First Name3 (LF) 4448**] in [**10/2168**], CHF (EF 20%), COPD s/p trach in [**8-/2168**]
who was recently hospitalized in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] from [**Date range (1) 13695**] with
Pseudomonas pneumonia and was discharged on Aztreonam to [**Hospital1 13696**] Rehab after developing rash with Zosyn. The patient is
unable to provide history. Per family, she was doing well the
day after the discharge, but about 48 hours prior to admission
she became agitated, developed low grade fevers and had
increased WBC from 20 to 60. She was noted to have increased
rash that spread to her arms and legs. Per family, the patient
also developed diarrhea a few days prior to admission.
.
On presentation to the ED, the patient's vital signs temp 101.6,
BP 84/49, HR 96, RR 19, O2 sat 98% on vent. WBC 60.3 and lactate
initially 5.8. Her CXR showed no CHF or infiltrate. In the ED
MUST protocol initiated. Left femoral line was placed and she
received Vancomycin 1 gm IV once, Flagyl 500 mg IV, Protonix 40
mg IV, Tylenol 650 mg once, hurricane spray, urojet, Anzemet,
Haldol 0.5 mg IV x1. Levophed started. Patient received total of
3L NS. SBP 80's -> 154. Lactate came down to 3.8.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient afebrile, SBP 100/51, she was on
Levophed at 0.03 initially that was quickly weaned off. The
patient denies any complaints. No CP, no SOB, no pain. She does
endorse itching due to rash.

Pertinent Labs/Studies:
.
CXR [**2168-11-6**]:
Comparison with [**2168-10-31**]. The tracheostomy tube is
unchanged. An NG tube extends below the level of the
hemidiaphragm. The pacer electrodes are unchanged in position.
The patient is rotated, but the cardiac and mediastinal contours
appear stable. There are no definite consolidations. No definite
pleural effusions, pulmonary vascular congestion, or
pneumothorax.
.
Chest CT [**2168-10-31**]: 1. No evidence of central upper extremity
vascular stenosis. 2. Multifocal air space opacities within the
right and left upper lobes, consistent with pneumonia.
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is likely reactive. 3. Six
millimeter nodular density within the right upper lobe. 3-month
followup CT of the chest is recommended. 4. Enlarged central
pulmonary arteries, consistent with underlying pulmonary
arterial hypertension.
.
Abd CT [**2168-11-6**]:
1. Interval development of ill-defined areas of low attenuation
in segment VII and VI of the liver. These could represent
developing abscesses. Due to the peripheral location of these
areas, ischemic etiology is also a consideration. 2. Vague areas
of wedge shaped low attenuation in both kidneys. These could be
secondary to infectious or ischemic etiology. Clinical
correlation is recommended. 3. Persistent bilateral pleural
effusions.
.
RUQ US ([**11-7**]): 1. No ultrasound correlate for the renal or
hepatic abnormality is detected on previous CT is seen. 2.
Gallbladder polyp.
.
TTE ([**11-7**]) Technically difficult study: 1.The left atrium is
normal in size. The left atrium is markedly dilated. 2. While
difficult to assess it appears that the left ventricular wall
thicknesses are severely thickened. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). 3.Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. Right ventricular systolic function is normal. 4.The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 5. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
6.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. IMPRESSION: Limited
study but no clear evidence of endocarditis. Compared to the
previous study of [**2168-8-18**], there is a maked improvement in
biventricular function. Compared to the previous study, the LVH
is much greater, which is probably a result of previous
underestimation of the LV septum and posterior wall.
