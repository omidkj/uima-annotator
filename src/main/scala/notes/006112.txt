Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
back and chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with Drug eluting stent to the left
circumflex artery and obtuse marginal artery


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 104372**] is an 88 yo F with HTN and HLD who presented to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED with chest and back pain
.
As per the pt's family, the episode started as left scapular
back pain that radiated to the chest and was [**9-16**] in intensity.
It was associated with N/V, SOB, but not diaphoresis. This has
never happened before. This occurred at 11 pm, and the pt was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED by ambulance around 1:30 am. She was
given an Aspirin 325 mg en route.
.
Initial vitals in the ED were: HR: 56, BP: 122/57, RR 14, 100%
on 2L by NC. In the ED, cardiac enzymes were drawn, and an EKG
was done. The pt's pain in the ED was treated with SLNTG x 2,
and 2 mg of morphine IV. When cardiac enzymes were +, the pt was
started on a heparin drip, was bolused with 600 mg of plavix,
was started on a NTG drip, and was sent to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3.
.
The pt arrived on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 pain free, however soon developed back
pain [**Last Name (un) 7162**]. The team on [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 sent her to CT urgently out of
concern for aortic dissection, however after this was ruled out,
the pt was sent to the cath lab.
.
In the cath lab, the pt was found to have thrombus in the
proximal LCx as well as in OM1. There was diffuse coronary
artery disease, and high grade stenosis in the LAD. DES were
placed in the LCx as well as in OM1. The patient's BP were
slightly low in the cath lab, and had a low O2 sat with an
increasing O2 requirement, so she was transferred to the CCU for
continuation of her care.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, syncope or presyncope

Cardiology Report Cardiac Cath Study Date of [**2181-6-16**]

BRIEF HISTORY:   88 year old female with HTN admitted with chest

discomfort radiating to her back. CTA was negative for aortic
dissection.  She ruled in for MI and EKG showed evolving
anterior ST
depressions and t wave inversions. She is referred for cardiac
catheterization.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
posterior STEMI, ongoing chest pain

PROCEDURE:
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 5 French right [**Last Name (un) 2699**] catheter,
advanced
to the left ventricle through a 5 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 5
French JL4 and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Percutaneous coronary revascularization was performed using
placement of
drug-eluting stent(s).
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.

PTCA COMMENTS:
Initial angiography revealed a total occlusion of the Lcx just
after
take off of a high OM1 which had an ostial 90% stenosis as well.
We
planned to treat these lesions with PTCA and stenting. Heparin
gtt had
already been started prior to the procedure and a therapeutic
ACT was
confirmed. A 6F XB3.5 guide provided adequate support for the
procedure.
We first passed a Prowater wire across the OM stenosis with
minimal
difficulty. Another Prowater wire crossed the Lcx stenosis with
minimal
di
