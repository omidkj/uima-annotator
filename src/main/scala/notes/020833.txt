structure and
transparency of the lung parenchyma is unremarkable. There is no
evidence of focal parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia.

cardiac silhouette, normal hilar and mediastinal contours. No
pleural
effusions, no pneumothorax.

[**8-15**]: CT head negative

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 20  yo M with a recent diagnosis of psychotic
disorder, presenting with tachycardia and low grade fevers, felt
to be due to NMS vs. malignant catatonia. Eventually it was felt
the pt has acute psychosis and malignant catatonia.

# Fever, rigitidy: Patient with presentation concerning for NMS-
fever, rigidity, tachycardia, elevated BP, and mental status
changes, namely catatonia/mutism and paranoia.  Malignant
catatonia, a psychiatric diagnosis, also presents in this
manner. Psychiatry felt that the seroquel at 100 mg daily was
unlikely to induce NMS. His TSH was normal. Utox and serum  tox
negative. Patient remained afebrile. Culture data was negative
(urine and blood cultures negative at time of discharge). White
count trended down. He was started on ativan 4 mg every 6 hours
standing, and this was tapered down to 1.5 mg every 6 hours
standing. His rigidity resolved as did his fever.
.
# Paranoia/malignant catatonia:  This could have been triggered
by family predisposition and marijuana use. His seroquel was
discontinued given initial concern for NMS. He was started on
standing ativan and abilify was titrated to 5 mg at night. He
was followed by psychiatry, and due to acute psychosis with the
pt claiming he was hearing voices tell him to go home, he was
kept under section 12 with 1:1 sitter.
.
# Sinus tachycardia: The patients heart rate would rise up to
170 with anxiety, and at times the pt claimed he was hearing
voices. His heart rate would quickly come down to the 100s-110s
with reassurance. He also had improvement of his heart rate with
his ativan. Again, his sinus tachycardia is felt to be due to
anxiety and psychosis. He has no evidence of infection. His
orthostatic vital signs were negative.
.
# Dizziness/ataxia: The patient had complaints of dizziness and
ataxia. This is felt to be likely due to his ativan. Attempt was
made to decrease his ativan to 1 mg every 6 hours from 3 mg
every 6 hours, but this caused increased anxiety and more
tachycardia. Due to apathy and sleepiness on the ativan, it was
difficult to have the patient comply with neurologic testing.
Head CT on admission was negative for any acute process. His
ataxia was resolved by [**8-19**] after his ativan had been tapered to
1.5 mg every 6 hours. He was able to ambulate without difficulty
back and forth down the hallway, and he was not orthostatic by
vital signs. It is felt the ativan is likely causing his
dizziness, and titrating this down as much as possible would
help his symptoms.
.
# Asthma: He was written for albuterol inhaler
.
#Eczema: Pt was written for betamethasone.
