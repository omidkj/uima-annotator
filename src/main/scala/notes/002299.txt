Imaging:
[**2192-10-14**]: CT Head: IMPRESSION:  Temporal intracerebral
hemorrhage and subcutaneous hematoma in the left frontal region.

.
[**2192-10-15**]: CT Head: IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of right
temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
.
[**2192-10-19**]: Portable Chest: IMPRESSION:  Congestive heart failure
with slight improvement in degree of pulmonary edema.
.
[**2192-11-1**]: Portable Chest: Portable supine AP radiograph of the
chest is reviewed, and compared with the previous study of
[**2192-10-29**]. There is marked increase in severe pulmonary
edema probably due to congestive heart failure associated with
cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusion. There is increased
atelectasis in both lower lobes.  The possibility of
superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. Pacemaker leads and
nasogastric tube remain in place.  No pneumothorax is
identified. The radiograph is suboptimal in technique.

Brief Hospital Course:
A [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of dementia, CHF, DVT and PE
([**5-20**]), Afib, previously on anticoagulation therapy admitted
s/p fall with intraparenchymal hemorrhage on admission.
.
#. Right Temporal Lobe Cerebral Hemorrhage: The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] s/p fall at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab. Patient was found
to have a 2x2 intraparenchymal bleed on CT with noted decline in
mental status while in the ED. This bleed occurred in the
setting of a supertherapautic INR from coumadin. The patient had
immediate reversal of her anticoagulation with 4 units of FFP
and received 6 units of platelets for thrombocytopenia with
platelet count of 93 and was loaded on dilantin for seizure
prophylaxis and started on Keppra as well. The patient was
evaluated by neurosurgery who did not feel there was an
indication for surgery, but did recommend reversal of
anticoagulation with goal of INR < 1.3 and platelets > 1000. The
patient was transferred to the ICU and intubated for airway
protection. The patient had a sodium of 158 on admission and was
given NS for hypovolemia followed by free water repletion to a
normal sodium which was discontinued after normalization and
also upon recommendation from neurosurg given concern for
increasing edema in setting of intracranial bleed. With regards
to her bleed, the patient had two repeat Head CTs which
demonstrated stable bleed without expansion or midline shift.
Given that the hematoma was stable, neurosurgery signed off
recommending repeat Head CT in approximately 4 weeks time. Upon
further discussion, they reported to the treating team that the
