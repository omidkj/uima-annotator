History of Present Illness:
82F with history of UC, PSC s/p biliary stenting, COPD and
recent SBO s/p exlap/adhesion lysis, recently discharged on [**8-3**]
after hospitalization for presumed cholangitis, (ERCP deferred,
pt improved on antbx) re-presents with shaking chills and fever.
At home since discharge on [**8-3**] she has been experiencing
persistent nausea & LE edema (up 10 lbs at last discharge) which
improved on home lasix. Taking a course of 12d flagyl 6weeks
cipro per ID recommendations. Until this morning she was
recuperating at home without new or worsening symptoms when she
suddenly developed shaking chills. Son took temp (102.5), gave 1
g tylenol, temp came down. Since she was otherwise asymptomatic
they went to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**]. Has been taking cipro/flagyl as
prescribed. No abdominal pain, no shortness of breath. Last BM
yesterday was non-bloody non-melanotic. She has been
intermittently nauseated at home recently and takes home zofran;
denies vomiting, one episode of choking while drinking in past
few days. No symptoms of dysuria or hematuria. Regarding her UC,
she has no recent history of mucousy or bloody stools or
abdominal cramping. Last colonoscopy in [**2198-12-19**] was
without evidence of hyperplasia. See PMH below for details of
recent admissions for cholangitis and SBO.

no concerning abd findings. [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] labs: WBC 14 (97%
neutrophils no bands), INR 2.1, LFTs largely normal (ALT/AST
28/29 tbili 0.75 AlkPhos 156. UA clean, lactate 1.4. CXR with
effusion but no infiltrate. Blood cx sent (no growth), CT
abdomen done. Became hypotensive to 80/40, responsive to 5L IVF.
Also received 1 dose vanc/cefepime/flagyl, and 650 mg tylenol
for RUQ tenderness after exam. 2 mg IV magnesium and 1x zofran
for nausea (no vomiting).

Imaging:
================
CT Abd [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**]:
No abscess/obstruction. Diverticulosis without Diverticulitis.
S/p cholecystectomy s/p R hemicolectomy, colon decompressed.
Some biliary dilatation and ?hepatic parenchymal changes in
lower lobe of liver, no sign of surgical abdomen.
.
CXR [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**]: possible retrocardiac opacity also seen on
CT, concerning for aspiration PNA
.
ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to hypokinesis of the septum,
anterior free wall, and apex. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
normal free wall contractility. There are focal calcifications
in the aortic arch. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: no definite vegetations seen; focal wall motion
abnormalities in the LAD distribution. If clinically suggested,
the absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not
exclude endocarditis.
.
CXR [**2199-8-13**]: Bilateral lung volumes remain low. Bibasilar
atelectases are persisting and unchanged. No relevant change on
comparison to the recent radiograph dated [**2199-7-31**].
