CT scan: There is a small amount of retroperitoneal hemorrhage
present, as well as bleeding into the left psoas and right
iliacus muscle. There is no dominant retroperitoneal hemorrhage
collection.

TTE [**2167-1-28**]: Conclusions:  The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction. LV systolic function appears depressed.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be
absent in the presence of elevated right sided pressures.
Compared with the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2167-1-27**], left
ventricular systolic function appears similar to slightly
improved except that the heart rate is now higher.

TTE [**2167-1-27**]: Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed. Marked lateral
hypokinesis and
inferior/posteror akinesis are present.
3. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Right
ventricular systolic
function appears depressed.
4. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
5. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a left dominant
system. The
LCX had a 99% proximal stenosis with thrombus. The LMCA had an
ulcerated
plaque with a 40% stenosis. The LAD had an 80% mid-vessel
lesion. The
RCA was small and nondominant.
2. Hemodynamics on entry showed elevated filling pressures
(RVEDP 26 mm
Hg, PCWP mean 29 mm Hg), moderate pulmonary hypertension (PASP
47 mm
Hg), and a normal cardiac index (2.8 l/mn/m2) while on dopamine,

levophed, and with the IABP in place on 1:1. Additionally, there
were
large V waves to 42 mm Hg in the PCWP tracing, suggestive of
ischemic
mitral regurgitation.
3. Hemodynamics after intervention showed decreased filling
pressures
(RVEDP 16 mm Hg, PCWP mean 22 mm Hg) without the large V waves
on the
PCWP tracing. Post intervention the pulmonary hypertension was
less
severe (PASP 36 mm Hg).
4. Diagnostic procedure was complicated by one episode of
ventricular
tachycardia, which resolved with 200 J defibrillation and
lidocaine 100
mg IV bolus.
5. Successful primary PCI of the LCX with a 3.0 x 18 mm Cypher
DES,
complicated by likely stent thrombosis, treated with a 3.5 mm
balloon
and export cathter.
6. Successful PCI of the proximal-mid LAD with a 3.0 x 18 mm
Cypher DES.
7. Successful kissing stent deployment in the LMCA into the LAD
(3.0 x
23 mm) and LCX (3.5 x 23 mm) with two Cypher DES.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Ischemic MR.
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Elevated filling pressures.
4. Acute lateral myocardial infarction, managed by acute PCI of
the
LCX, LAD, and LMCA.
5. Cardiogenic shock, managed with IABP insertion.



Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD:  Mr. [**Known lastname 5448**] was taken emergently to the cath lab, and
had stents to his LCx, LAD, and kissing stents placed in his
LMCA.  An IABP was placed in the lab, and he was transferred to
the CCU on levophed.  One day after admission, his BP acutely
dropped and a stat echo was obtained.  This was essentially
unchanged from one day prior.  His balloon pump and levophed
were eventually weaned off.  He was kept on aspirin, plavix, and
a statin.  He was placed on an ACE inhibitor and a beta blocker,
which were titrated up for pulse and blood pressure control.  He
will need to have a relook cath in 3 months given his L main
stents.

2. Pump:  His EF was 30%, and he received a great deal of IVF
resuscitation.  Once his bp stabilized, he was aggressively
diuresed with Lasix.  He had a repeat echo the day after
admission which demonstrated an improved EF, of 40-45%.  He was
placed on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] for afterload reduction, and a beta blocker was
added later.

3. Rhythm:  He had a pacemaker already in place, and initially
he was intermittently A-sensing and V-pacing, as well as AV
pacing.  This was changed by the attending so that he was
a-sensing and a-pacing.  He also had a very short (minutes) run
of afib, which self-terminated.  He was bolused with amio and
placed on an amio drip, and then changed to po loading doses.
This was tapered down to 400 mg po daily.  Per the attending,
because he had peri-MI afib, he may only need 1 month of
amiodarone and then this can stop altogether.  He had no further
arrhythmias.  He was not anticoagulated [**1-14**] GI bleed.

4. Pulm: He was initially intubated because he was hypotensive
and unstable.  He remained intubated in the setting of his
volume overload, and he wasn't extubated until his pulmonary
status was maximized with diuresis.  He also had thick
secretions from his ET tube, which twice grew out serratia.  He
had an infiltrate on CXR.  He was treated initially with Zosyn,
which was changed to levofloxacin per sensitivities, for a total
10 day course.

5. Endocrine:  Because of his history of pan-hypo pit and his
hypotension, he was placed on stress-dose steroids.  These were
tapered down once his bp was stable, and need to be tap
