Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, lower extremity swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7072**] is a 68 year old woman with history of CAD (s/p
stent of mid-LAD in [**2177**]) who presents with weeks of gradually
worsening dyspnea on exertion and lower extremity edema to the
thighs. Approximately two weeks ago, she started noticing that
she felt "worse". Her legs started to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she went to see
her PCP (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1789**]. He examined her and felt that she needed
emergent evaluation, so he sent her to the ED. She denies
current chest pain, shortness of breath ("much better"), and
palpitations. She complains of intermittent chest pain with
walking, especially when she takes a deep breath. She has a
non-productive cough which is worse with exercise. She reports
3-pillow orthopnea but denies PND.

In the ED, she was initially satting 80% on room air and was
tachypneic. EKG showed no acute changes. Her first set of
cardiac biomarkers was negative. Her chest x-ray showed severe
pulmonary edema. She was initially placed on a nitro drip, which
was subsequently discontinued to enable furosemide diuresis.

On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.


Past Medical History:
- Stage II breast cancer. Diagnosed [**2172**] with 5cm infiltrating
ductal carcinoma of left breast, histologic grade III with LVI.
15 positive axillary lymph nodes. ER neg. Treated with radical
mastectomy, post-mastectomy wall XRT, four cycles of AC.
- CAD(s/p PTCA to mLAD)
- Breast CA (s/p R. mastectomy and chemo and XRT c/b ILD)
- Asthma
- Chronic bilateral arm pain/cyanosis
- Hypertension, although not on any heart meds


Social History:
Social history is significant for current tobacco use (1 pack
per week, with > 50 pack-year history). There is no history of
alcohol abuse.  She lives alone in [**Location (un) 669**] and works as a hotel
desk coordinator at the [**Location (un) 7073**] [**Last Name (un) 28893**].

Family History:
There is family history of premature coronary artery disease
(brother), but no history of sudden death.

EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm at 99bpm with Q in II, II,
aVF, TWI in I, aVL, isolated ST elevation in V2, poor R wave
progression (which is new from previous, dated [**2181-10-30**]).

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2185-5-5**] 9:09 PM
There is significant engorgement of the vascular pedicle,
pulmonary vascular indistinctness and interlobular septal lines
consistent with severe pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette
remains markedly enlarged. There are bilateral pleural
effusions. The left effusion is loculated over the lung apex. A
markedly tortuous aorta is again noted. The bones are diffusely
osteopenic.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2185-5-6**] 2:31 AM
The heart is abnormally enlarged. Persistent pulmonary edema
that has not changed since the last examination along with
persistent small bilateral pleural effusion. The azygos vein is
abnormally distended. The unilateral opacity seen projecting
over the left mid lung region hasn't progressed.

Echocardiogram [**2185-5-6**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. The coronary sinus is dilated (diameter >15mm). There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild to moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis
of the anterior, anteroseptal, distal inferior and apical severe
hypokinesis/akinesis. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There are filamentous strands
on the aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences
(normal variant). There is also a focal echodensity associated
with the left coronary cusp, for which the differential
diagnosis includes calcification, healed vegetation, or a valve
tumor. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no
aortic stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is at least mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension (may be underestimated
given severity of tricuspid regurgitation). There is no
pericardial effusion.

Echocardiogram [**2185-5-20**]
Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2185-5-6**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size. Mild
regional LV systolic dysfunction. No resting LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Moderate global RV
free wall hypokinesis. [Intrinsic RV systolic function likely
more depressed given the severity of TR].
AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels. Focal calcifications in aortic root.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral annular calcification. Mild to moderate ([**12-15**]+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate [2+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Frequent atrial premature beats. Left pleural
effusion.
.
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis
of the distal anterior wall and apex. The remaining segments
contract normally (LVEF = 50 %). Right ventricular chamber size
is moderately increased with mild free wall hypokinesis.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. T
