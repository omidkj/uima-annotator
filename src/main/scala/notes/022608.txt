Brief Hospital Course:
In the emergency department on [**2109-9-1**], the patient was found to
be hypotensive with BP 87/59 with an elevated lactate.  He met
criteria for sepsis and was given levofed and admitted to the
ICU.  By problem, his course was as follows:

Hypotension: Hypotensive 80s/50s on admission.  BP improved to
100/50 with IVF, levofed, and Solumedrol.  He remained in the
ICU, hemodynamically stable, until [**2109-9-4**].  At that point, he
was transfered to the medical floor.  There, he remained
hemodynamically stable without need for pressure support.
Central access was d/c'd on [**2109-9-7**].

Afib: His chronic atrial fibrillation continued with rate
controlled by diltiazem.

CHF: He required diuresis for SOB on an almost daily basis.

SOB:  The patient initially required supplementary O2 via
non-rebreather mask to maintain O2 saturation in the low 90%'s.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was persistently tachypniec in the ICU and on the floor,
and uncomfortably short of breath with movement.  On the floor,
he maintained O2 saturation 90-94% on 4L O2 via nasal cannula,
however.  He underwent therapeutic tap of his right pleural
effusions on [**2109-9-6**] and of his left pleural effusion on
[**2109-9-9**].  On [**2109-9-10**], the patient became increasingly short of
breath.  No pneumothorax was present on CXR and PE was
suspected.  The patient was started on argatroban and transfered
to the MICU.

Pulm mass: Patient was afebrile with WBC 5.8 on admission.  His
WBC count rose rapidly despite antibiotic therapy (initially
ceftriaxone/azithromycin/vancomycin, then
ceftriaxone/azithromycin, then levofloxacin). The infectious
disease service was consulted.  On admission, the patient was
found to have a RUL lesion on CXR and chest CT suspicious for
TB.  The patient has a history of positive PPD test.  The
patient underwent bronchoscopy on [**2109-9-3**] that visualized a
lesion in the right main bronchus.  The lesion was not biopsied
due to the patient's high INR.
   Culture data:
       Induced sputum stains were negative x3 for acid-fast
bacteria.
       Gram stain showed only respiratory tract flora and yeast.

       Sputum cultures
       Urine cultures
       Perinephric mass fluid cultures

Abdominal mass: An infiltrated perinephric mass, retroperiotneal
lymphadenopathy, and multiple hepatic lesions were initially
identified on chest CT.  Their presence was confirmed on
abdominal/pelvic CT.  On [**2109-9-6**], the patient underwent
CT-guided biopsy of the perinephric mass.  Lymph node FNA and
pleural fluid cytology demonstrated a high grade B cell
lymphoma.

Coagulation: The patient is on coumadin at home for afib.  On
admission, his INR was 3.7.  INR rose with administration of
antibiotics and peaked at 4.9 on [**9-2**].  The patient was reversed
with vitamin K and 4 units of FFP.  On the floor, he was
anticoagulated with a heparin drip, stopped for procedures.  His
platelet count fell from 200 on admission. Heparin was stopped
on [**2109-9-9**].  Argatroban was started for suspected PE on [**2109-9-10**].

Renal:  The patient's creatinine rose from 0.7 on admission.
Close attention was paid to fluid status.  The patient had
hematuria on UA on [**2109-9-4**].  Foley catheter was d/c'd on
[**2109-9-6**].

Urologic: The patient was discovered to have a paraphimosis on
[**2109-9-9**].  This was manually reduced by the urology service on
that day.  On [**2109-9-9**], the paraphimosis recurred, was again
reduced by urology, and a Foley catheter was inserted.

Nutrition:  The nutrition service was asked to evaluate the
patient.  The patient received a low-salt, diabetic diet with
Glycerna supplementation.

Disposition: The patient and his family decided to persue
comfort measures only as his prognosis with chemotherapy was
very poor and he had multiple comorbidities. The patient died
[**2109-9-12**] at 1:47 am.
