TTE [**11-20**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum and
anterior wall and basal inferior wall. The apex is not well
seen. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35-40 %).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with regional systolic dysfunction suggestive of
multivessel CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-7-18**],
inferior wall hypokinesis is now suggested c/w ischemia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted electively on [**2141-11-16**] for DCD renal tranplant.
The operation was notable for a donor kidney cold ischemia time
of ~22 hours.  The patient tolerated the procedure well with no
complications.  He was admitted to the SICU because he required
BIPAP overnight for hypoxemia, but was weaned off by the
morning.  Of note, the patient's SBP remained in the mid 90's on
POD1, and this prompted troponin analysis.  His initial troponin
was found to be elevated to 1.97.  The patient's EKG showed
evidence of ST segment depression, similar to his previous
episode of demand ischemia seen in [**7-10**].  This picture was
confounded, however, by the patient's continued renal failure in
the immediate post operative period.  He required hemodialysis
on POD 0 for fluid overload, and he tolerated temoval of 1.5 L.
Early in the am of POD2, the patient was found to be recovering
well, with no need for hemodynamic or respiratory support.  He
was transferred to F10 in good condition.

Over the weekend, his hospital course was notable for difficult
to control FBG's in the setting of post operative
methylprednisolone.  He was placed on an insulin drip, which was
weaned off the next day with the aid of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult and the
administration of a strict fixed and sliding scale insulin
regimen.  On POD 3, the patient's troponin was found to be
persistently elevated to 2.3, after briefly decreasing to 1.8
from 1.97.  Based on this information and his past medical
history of CABG and NSTEMI, a cardiology consult was obtained.
A TTE showed a new area of hypokinesis consistent with a new
ischemic event.  The cardiology staff recommended medical
management considering his recent renal transplant; a
contraindication to cardiac catherization.  He was discharged on
aspirin/plavix, carvedilol, imdur, and hydralazine.

By POD 4, the patient's graft function appeared to be picking
up, with a doubling in urine output from the day prior.  The
transplant nephrology staff was impressed with this finding, and
suggested that the patient may not need outpatient dialysis.  In
fact, they suggested that his residual volume overload could be
treated with lasix instead of hemodialysis.  Because he was set
to leave on Thursday before a holiday weekend, the patient was
dialyzed prior to discharge and given a laboratory appointment
on Sunday.  He was instructed to take Lasix 100mg PO BID on days
he was not going to have dialysis.

He was deemed safe to discharge home on post operative day 7.
By this time he had received medication and insulin teaching,
and had received treatment and follow up recommendations from
the cardiology staff.  He is fully ambulatory, and is eating and
voiding without difficulty.  His post operative pain is well
controlled on oral medications.
