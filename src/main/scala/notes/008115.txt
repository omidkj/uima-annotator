RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2184-2-25**] 1:15 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: s/p biVAD w/worsening flows-r/o efufsion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
42 year old man who is s/p BiVAD
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p biVAD w/worsening flows-r/o efufsion
SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST

REASON FOR EXAM: Worsening flows. Rule out effusion. Patient
post BIVAD.

Comparison is made with prior study dated [**2184-2-23**].

FINDINGS:
Single AP portable view of the chest shows worsening in mild
pulmonary edema and increase in moderate enlarged
cardiomediastinal silhouette. The right lateral chest was not
included on the film. Bilateral pleural effusions, greater on
the right side, have increased.

ET tube tip is in standard position. Right internal jugular vein
catheter is in the right brachiocephalic vein. Right subclavian
vein catheter tip is in the SVC. Unchanged position of the
BiVAD. NG tube tip is not well visualized and cannot be followed
distally to the distal esophagus.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: s/p BIVAD, s/p  tamponade and  evacuation of
hematoma. Tamponade.
BP (mm Hg): 86/53
HR (bpm): 105
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2184-2-25**] at 16:00

REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] R. [**Doctor Last Name **]

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2184-2-25**].


RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.


LEFT VENTRICLE: Severely depressed LVEF.

AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no
atherosclerotic plaque.

AORTIC VALVE: Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient
was monitored
by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**] throughout the procedure. The patient
was sedated for
the TEE. Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test
Information
section). No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears to be
atrial
fibrillation.

Conclusions:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed. The left
ventricular
cannula is well seen and appears to be patent without
significant flow
turbulance. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve
leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The
pulmonary vein flow into the left atrium appears turbulant with
increased flow
velocities (also present in prior study). There is extrinsic
compression of
the right heart and left atrium with echodense material (likely
hematoma).

Impression: Probable hematoma compression of the left atrium,
right atrium,
and right ventricle.
Compared to the prior study, (prior to hematoma evacuation)
overall
compression may be less marked.

*** Not Signed Out ***

BRIEF HISTORY:   42 year old male with no significant medical
history
who presented to an outside hospital in atrial fibrillation with
rapid
ventricular response. An echocardiogram revealed an LVEF of 10%.
 He
become hypotensive requiring intubation and vasopressor support
and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. He is now referred to the cardiac cath lab
for
evaluation of his coronary arteries and placement of an
intra-aortic
balloon pump.

INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Coronary artery disease, cardiogenic shock

PROCEDURE:
Left Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right femoral artery, using a 5 French left [**Last Name (un) 2699**] catheter,
advanced
to the ascending aorta through a 5 French introducing sheath.
Coronary Angiography: was performed in multiple projections
using a 5
French JL4 and a 5 French JR4 catheter, with manual contrast
injections.
Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation: was initiated with an
introducer
sheath using a Cardiac Assist 9 French 40cc wire guided
catheter,
inserted via the right femoral artery.
Conscious Sedation:  was provided with appropriate monitoring
performed by
a member of the nursing staff.
