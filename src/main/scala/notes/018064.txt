Admission Date:  [**2165-2-7**]       Discharge Date:  [**2165-3-29**]

Date of Birth:   [**2120-9-25**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Transplant Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 44 year old
female with end stage renal disease secondary to diabetes
Type 1 since the age of 10 who had undergone living related
renal transplantation in [**2151-2-18**].  Subsequently the
patient suffered a chronic rejection and required a
retransplantation on [**2164-10-24**].  This was a living,
unrelated male transplantation.  Postoperative course was
complicated by Klebsiella urinary tract infection and
ureteral necrosis requiring ureteropyeloplasty with stent on
[**2164-11-21**], and required a percutaneous nephrostomy
tube.  Since then the patient has had several admissions due
to abdominal pain.  In [**2164-12-20**], the patient was
admitted and was found to have urine leaking from her wound.
Nephrogram at the time showed extravasation of urine from the
anastomosis between the transplanted kidney and the ureter.
An internal/external stent was placed and the patient
continued on her antibiotics.  The patient was discharged to
a rehabilitation hospital on [**2165-1-29**], only to
return to [**Hospital6 256**] on [**2165-2-7**], again complaining of abdominal pain, nausea and
vomiting.  Staff at the rehabilitation hospital noted that
the patient's p.o. intake was poor due to nausea and vomiting
and the patient also had several regular bowel movements,
mostly soft up to four times a day.  On arrival to [**Hospital6 1760**], the patient was her usual
state, uncooperative with the medical staff and complaining
that she was nauseous.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End stage renal disease, secondary to
diabetes Type 1, Stage 10, status post living related renal
transplantation in [**2150**], complicated by chronic rejection
status post a living unrelated renal transplantation on
[**2164-10-24**], history of postoperative complication noted
as above.  Initially, the patient suffered recurrent urinary
tract infection with Enterobacter cloacae.  In addition, the
patient has a history of hypothyroidism, osteopenia, diabetic
myonecrosis, a long history of depression, personality
disorder, myocardiac and benzodiazepine dependence, eating
disorder, diabetes-related neuropathy, nephropathy and
retinopathy, neopathic bladder, gastroparesis,
hypercholesterolemia, history of vaginal cancer in situ and
otitis media.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, Ativan/Haldol.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Tacrolimus 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
CellCept [**Pager number **] mg b.i.d., Ambien, Protonix, Lopressor 25 mg
b.i.d., Meropenem 5 mg b.i.d., Synthroid, insulin sliding
scale with Glargine, Reglan 10 mg q. 6 hours.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory studies on admission revealed
white count 7.9, hematocrit 40.6, platelets 351.
Chemistries, sodium 140, potassium 4.3, chloride 104, carbon
dioxide of 24, BUN 21, creatinine 1.2, glucose 172, calcium
was 9.7, magnesium 1.4, phosphorus 1.9, PT 14.1, PTT 29.8
with an INR of 1.3.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission
revealed the patient is afebrile at 97.0, heart rate 68,
blood pressure 165/80, respiratory rate 18, sating 99% on
room air, fingerstick was 177.  The patient was alert and
oriented times three, noncooperative, thin-appearing woman.
No jugulovenous distension, supple neck.  Cardiovascular
examination, rate and rhythm regular, S1 and S2 without
murmurs.  Respiratory clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen, soft, nondistended and nontender with nephrostomy
tube in place.  There is discomfort over the bladder noted.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the patient's complicated history of
transplanted kidney and bladder problems, Neurology was
consulted before Foley catheter was placed, and nephrostomy
study was planned to investigate the patient's persistent
nausea and vomiting the patient underwent a barium
esophagogram on [**2165-2-11**].  The esophagus was normal
in caliber and although this was a very limited study the
majority of the barium passed out of the esophagus into the
stomach and proximal small bowel in ten minutes.  The patient
reported to the floor after this study and was given lunch,
and soon thereafter the patient was found by the nursing
staff to be lying on the right side in a pool of vomit and
blood.  The patient was unresponsive, cyanotic, "gasping for
air," and incontinent of stool.  Vital signs at the time
revealed the patient had a heart rate of 80 with blood
pressure 160/90, breathing with her mouth with some
difficulty, 99% on room air with a blood sugar of 443.
Because the patient was unresponsive, the patient was
emergently transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where the
patient was intubated for airway production and underwent
workup of her acute mental status change.

The patient's Intensive Care Unit stay from [**2165-2-11**]
went to [**2165-3-4**] will be summarized by systems.

Central nervous system - The patient was found to be
unresponsive on transfer to Intensive Care Unit.  She was
flaccid and her neck was stiff.  Her eyes were deviated to
the right side and she had upgoing toes bilaterally.  The
patient underwent emergent computerized tomography scan of
the head without contrast which showed no evidence of acute
infarct or hemorrhage, the only findings were microvascular
angiopathy consistent with a history of hypertension.  The
patient also underwent an emergent magnetic resonance of the
head and magnetic resonance angiography of the head which
showed no infarct or hemorrhages.  There was no evidence of
mass effect, and the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] and the major
tributaries in the head showed no evidence of aneurysmal flow
abnormality.  The patient was suspected to have had a seizure
and was empirically started on Dilantin.  The patient also
underwent an electroencephalogram which did not show any
epileptiforms.  When the patient was intubated for airway
production the patient needed to be placed on Propofol for
sedation.  The patient underwent an lumbar puncture to rule
out encephalitis and there was no evidence consistent with
infectious causes of encephalitis.  The patient underwent a
repeat magnetic resonance imaging scan of the head on [**2165-2-21**] which showed profound changes in the appearance of
the brain with large areas of elevated P2 signal and
diffusion restrictions symmetrically within the posterior
temporal and occipital lobes.  There were also abnormal signs
of the left ischial cortex and the subtemporal white matter
on the left, all demonstrating extensive enhancement.  The
distribution of these abnormalities all raise the possibility
of Tacrolimus toxicity in this leukoencephalopathy.  It
should be noted that on retrospect the patient had Tacrolimus
level of 14.2 the morning of [**2165-2-11**].  The patient
was weaned off Propofol and extubated on [**2-25**] and her
neurological status was carefully observed.

The patient enjoyed initial improvements, however, it was
clear that the patient remained below baseline in terms of
her mental status, showing impairment in higher cortical
functions.  The patient came out of the unit on [**2165-3-4**] and continued to be monitored carefully on the floor
with respect to her mental status.  The patient underwent a
repeat magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain on [**2165-3-11**] which showed a resolution of the diffusion
abnormality seen on the scan from [**2-21**] with the remaining
flares.  This was interpreted by Radiology to be
nonsuggestive of a leukoencephalopathy but more suggestive of
encephalitis or infarction.  However, Tacrolimus associated
toxicity does not always result in irreversible changes on
the scans and it is the opinion of the transplant team that
the patient suffered Tacrolimus toxicity-related
leukoencephalopathy.  The patient underwent repeat
electroencephalogram on [**3-14**] which showed diffuse
swelling consistent with encephalopathy with cortical and
subcortical involvement and there were no epileptiforms.

Neurology Team had been consulted since the event on [**2165-2-11**], and suggested that since there was no evidence of
epilepsy, electroencephalogram as well as the clinical
observation, t
