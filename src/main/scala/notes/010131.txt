Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is an 82-year-old
male with a history of coronary artery disease and a history
of CLL diagnosed in [**2141**].  He had been on medications off and
on for several weeks prior to admission.  In addition, the
patient had a platelet count of 121 in [**5-14**] when admitted
from the Emergency Department for angina and was transfused
for further management of unstable angina.  He was given the
diagnosis of drug-related ITP.  The patient also has a
history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary
artery disease, with a catheterization in [**2152**] with 100% main
right coronary artery, high-grade LAD stented.  He was
readmitted in [**8-13**] with chest pain.  The patient presented
to the Emergency Department prior to admission with
exertional angina and chest pain.  EKG showed lateral
changes.  The patient had a positive troponin, flat CK,
positive MBI, and was admitted for decreased platelets and
NST EMI.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was an elderly man in no apparent
distress, alert and oriented, afebrile with a blood pressure
of 117/44, heart rate 20, saturating at 98% on four liters
nasal cannula.  HEENT:  Examination significant for two small

Lungs:  Clear with a few crackles at the bilateral bases.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  Few scattered petechiae, no ecchymoses
or erythema, warm and nontender.  Examination was significant
for a 1-2 cm axillary node on the right which was mobile and
nontender.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission laboratory studies showed white
count of 7.4, hematocrit 28.8, platelet count 26 from 31, 7%
bands, 45% lymphocytes, 41% polys, and 7% monocytes.  CPK was
102 to 122, troponin I 0.32 to 0.44.

Chest x-ray showed interstitial edema and curly B lines.
Urinalysis showed large blood, trace protein, 0-2 white blood
cells.  Chemistries were within normal limits.  Potassium was
4.1 and creatinine 0.9.  Smear showed decreased platelet
spherocytes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was started on prednisone for a
presumed diagnosis of drug-induced ITP, 60 mg p.o. q.d.  All
home cardiac and diabetic medications were continued.  The
patient was continued on prednisone, being followed by
hematology-oncology, and angina was being treated by medical
management and monitoring.  The patient was stable on the
floor with severe thrombocytopenia being followed by
hematology until [**2154-7-4**], when he developed the acute onset
of anginal symptoms and flash pulmonary edema with
hypotension.  The patient was transferred to the unit.
Diabetes was being managed by glipizide, cardiac diabetic
diet, and q.i.d. fingersticks.  Hematologically the patient
was continued on prednisone and had platelets and packed red
blood cells on call for transfusion for possible
catheterization.  Hematocrit was to be greater than 30.

The patient was clinically improving throughout the course in
the intensive care unit with platelets up to 39, stable white
count, stable laboratory studies otherwise.  Cardiac and
antidiabetic medications were continued and the patient was
doing well.

The patient continued his course in the coronary care unit,
was afebrile with stable vital signs on metoprolol, Isordil,
Captopril, amlodipine, Lipitor, levofloxacin, prednisone,
glipizide and insulin sliding scale.  White blood cell count
was 13.3 from 14.8, hematocrit of 32.5 and platelet count 49
up from 37.  Electrolytes were stable.

From a cardiac standpoint the patient was clinically
improving with no further chest pain, normal sinus rhythm,
and an out of sinus bradycardia.

From a respiratory standpoint the patient was having a
productive cough with improved oxygen saturations and
responding to diuretics with decreased crackles on
examination.  The patient was on Levaquin day three for
possible right lower lobe pneumonia, and fingersticks,
Regular Insulin sliding scale, and glipizide were being
administered for diabetes.

Hematologically, the patient had an increase in platelets.
Prednisone dose was increased to 120.  The patient had a
stable hematocrit and heparin was being held due to decreased
platelets.

On [**2154-7-10**] the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.
Laboratory studies were significant for a platelet count of
83 from 77 and glucose of 271.  Coagulation studies included
a PT of 12.5, PTT of 30.4, INR 1.  Cultures showed
coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus sensitive to
Levaquin.  The patient was status post coronary artery bypass
grafting x 1 off pump, left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending coronary artery.  Please refer to
operative note.  The pericardium was left open.  Lines
included an A line and a Swan-Ganz catheter.  Wires included
two ventricular and zero atrial wires.  Tubes included a
right and left chest tube and one mediastinal tube.  On
transfer to the recovery unit the patient was in normal sinus
rhythm with a mean arterial pressure of 69, central venous
pressure of 8, PAD of 13, [**Doctor First Name 1052**] of 20.  Drips included
Levophed, nitroglycerin and propofol.  The patient had a
temperature of 101.5 overnight in normal sinus rhythm with a
blood pressure of 98/34, 96% on 12 liters nebulizers.  The
patient was transfused three units of packed red blood cells,
fresh frozen plasma and cryo.

On postoperative day two in the unit the prior required six
units of red blood cells overnight, in sinus rhythm at 69,
with a blood pressure of 130/41.

On [**2154-7-12**] the patient underwent a cardiac catheterization
and had the left main coronary artery stented.  Please see
the catheterization note for details.  The patient was
transferred back to the cardiac surgery recovery unit in
stable condition on nitroglycerin drip being weaned, with an
hematocrit of 29.5 on Plavix and aspirin.  Prednisone 60 was
continued.  The Swan-Ganz catheter and A line were being
discontinued.

On [**2154-7-15**] the patient was in stable condition, afebrile
with stable vital signs.  CBC showed a white count of 12.6,
hematocrit of 29.1, and platelet count of 192.  The patient
was transferred to the floor on Lopressor 12.5 and Imdur 60
with hematocrit stable, being seen by physical therapy and
occupational therapy.

The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course on the floor was unremarkable.
Prednisone was being tapered as per hematology-oncology.  The
patient's vital signs were stable.  Physical examination was
unremarkable.  Wires were discontinued on [**2154-7-17**].
Medications were being continued and followed and laboratory
values were unremarkable.

On [**2154-7-19**] the patient's vital signs and physical
examination were unremarkable.  Laboratory values were
significant for a white count increase from 11 to 22,
hematocrit of 34.6 and platelet count stable at 202.  Current
management was continued.  The patient was not discharged for
observation.  The patient was pancultured.  Chest x-ray was
unremarkable and urinalysis was negative.

On [**2154-7-20**], postoperative day nine, the patient's white
count came down from 22 to 10.3.  Blood cultures were
pending.  The patient was observed overnight; addendum to
follow.
