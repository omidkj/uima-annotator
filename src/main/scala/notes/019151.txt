Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9853**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
extubation
PICC line placement and removal


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F with recent admisison for PNA who presents from rehab
with respiratory distress.  Patient has a PMH of HTN,
Alzheimer's, and chronic anemia who presents from her rehab
facility after intubation for respiratory distress.  Of note,
the patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 39348**] during
which she was diagnosed with multifocal HAP for which she was
treated with Vanc/Zosyn x 2 weeks.  She completed Zosyn on [**3-16**].
 Patient required intubation at that time due to hypoxia.  Per
the patient's daughter her mother had been very sleepy at the
rehab facility after her recent discharge.  However,
approximately 3 days ago her energy level improved and she was
more awake and responsive.  The patient was able to recognize
her and interact with her.  In fact, the patient's daughter
visited her mother this morning and noted her to be very
responsive and was without complaints.  The patient's daughter
also reports that her mother was being treated for some "GI"
infection which appears to have been possible c. diff.  The
patient was started on flagyl [**3-13**], to complete course on [**3-27**].
.
At approximately 1350 today, the patient was found to be in
respiratory distress with accessory muscle use and retracting.
Room air sat was noted to be 74%.  She was placed on NRB and her
sats improved to 90-97%.  ABG noted to be 7.17/82/177 on unknown
amount of oxygen.  Other VS were T 97.5 BP 170/70  HR 103-122,
EKG showed sinus tach. She was given [**1-5**]" nitropaste and
intubated at rehab.  BP fell to 88/62 and nitropaste was wiped
off and she was given IVF.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were T 97.6 BP 137/65  HR 93 O2 sat
100% on vent.  She was given versed 2mg, vanco 1gm and zosyn
4.5gm IV x1. EKG showed no changes, Trop was 0.1.  Repeat ABG
7.45/36/72.  CXR showed worsening pleural effusions with pulm.
edema.  She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 39350**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old Russian female with PMH of
HTN, alzheimer's, recent CVA and PNA who was admitted from rehab
with respiratory distress, requiring intubation and admitted to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management.

# Respiratory failure: On ABG at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab the pt had a mixed
hypoxemic and hypercarbic picture. The patient was intubated at
rehab. On admission the pt didn't have any evidence of pneumonia
(she had recently completed a course of antibiotics for
nosocomial pneumonia), and PE seemed unlikely as the pt had been
on subcutaneous heparin at rehab and her oxygenation improved
with intubation. The pt's chest xray did show mild pulmonary
edema and effusions, so the pt was diuresed with IV lasix, which
she tolerated well. On day 3 of admission the pt was
successfully intubated, and soon was weaned to room air. On the
day of extubation the pt was noted to have a leukocytosis and
new infiltrate on chest xray, so a new course of antibiotics was
initiated for a 7 day course for ventilator/hospital-acquired
pneumonia (of Vancomycin and Cefepime) which she completed. The
pt's sputum culture grew out gram + cocci in pairs and clusters.


# Leukocytosis: See above, now improving.

# Anemia: Baseline Hct low 30s, however was 24 on recent
discharge, currently stable at 28.  No evidence of bleeding.
Attributed to chronic disease in past.

# Hyponatremia: Resolved spontaneously during this admission.

# History of CVA: During this admission ASA and statin were
continued. ASA was stopped when she placed on the heparin gtt
(see below). Statin was discontinued given her prognosis.

# Cardiovascular:  No documented h/o CAD, however has known PVD
and also with q-waves on EKG which indicates a prior event.  EKG
is unchanged here. As seen in "results" section cardiac enzymes
were cycled and trended down, elevation was likely demand in the
setting of hypoxia. Beta blocker and ACEi were continued, ASA
and statin were stopped as above.

# afib with RVR: the patient had an episode of atrial
fibrillation with RVR to the 140s. This resolved with IV
metoprolol and there were no further episodes. Her metoprolol
was increased.

# HTN: On admission the pt's BP was elevated, further supporting
evidence of pulmonary edema. Continued BB, ACE at home dose with
holding parameters.

FEN: Pt was restarted on tube feeds following extubation. Tube
feeds are administered via NG tube. The NGT should

ACCESS: L-PICC. During this admission the pt's left hand became
edematous and ecchymotic. Left upper extremity ultrasound was
ordered to evaluate for upper extremity thrombus. The ultrasound
showed a non-occlusive thrombus in the left axillary vein. She
was started on a heparin gtt after consulting with neurology who
felt that she was far enough out from her stroke to make
antic
