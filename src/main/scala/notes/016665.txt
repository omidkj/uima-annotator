Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Headache, difficulty speaking

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation

History of Present Illness:
HPI: The patient is a 74 year old man with a history of
well-controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia presenting with
a
severe sudden onset headache with speech difficulty. This
history
is obtained from the patient's wife who accompanied him and was
present for the onset of symptoms. The headache started at
approximately [**2132**] with an onset over seconds. It predominantly
left frontal and reportedly did not affect his neck. He did not
complain of much besides the headache and did not have any
apparent nausea or vomiting, but he did seem to have difficulty
forming his words and constructing sentences, resulting in
fragmentation of his speech. He maintained consciousness
throughout this episode and did not have any apparent deficits
to
his wife besides the speech problem. His wife brought him to an
outside hospital where the patient received an NCHCT which
revealed a large left lobar hemorrhage; a physician there
explained this to the patient, but the patient wanted to leave,
and per his wife "did not seem to understand what the doctor was
saying." He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management with
Neurology and Neurosurgery being consulted emergently to assist
with management. He notably arrived very agitated, yelling, and
trying to leave his stretcher.

His wife reports that he has had two weeks of increasing
difficulty with formulating words and sentences without
enunciation difficulty. She also notes that over the past 6
months he has had progressive difficulty with short term memory,
often forgeting simple items and tasks. He previously was very
sharp and functional. She thinks that he has also become much
more repetitive.

The review of systems could not be obtained by the patient, but
the wife endorsed his prior headache, speech difficulty, and
memory changes without any other accompanying symptoms noted by
the patient to his wife.

Past Medical History:
HTN
HL
Hypothyroidism

Social History:
Retired, previously a police officer. Married, lives with his
wife. [**Name (NI) **] tobacco use. Occasional ETOH (one glass of wine per
week, if that). No illicit drug use.

Family History:
No siblings. Mother had a hip fracture and died of pneumonia.
Father died of an aneurysm rupture located behind his stomach.

General: Agitated, held down by EMS and staff, trying to get out
of the stretcher. / Head: NC/AT, no conjunctival icterus, no
injection, no oropharyngeal lesions / Neck: Supple, no nuchal
rigidity or meningismus / Cardiovascular: Mildly tachycardic, no

Neurologic Examination:

- Mental Status - Awake, alert, did not answer orientation
questions but responded to his name "[**Known firstname **]." Initially kept
saying to EMS "Doctor, release me, let go of me, [**Doctor First Name **] let me
go." He initially answered my orientation questions with "I
don't
know," and then fragments of words. He followed the simple
command of looking to the left and right, but would not look up
or down. Could not assess further as he was intubated. After
sedation and intubation, he would resist examination of the
face/eyes by turning his head and straining against his
restraints.

oriented x 3. Recalls a coherent history. Registration [**2-20**] and
recall [**2-20**]. Concentration maintained when recalling months
backwards. Follows two step commands, midline and appendicular.
Language fluent with intact repetition and verbal comprehension.
Normal prosody. No paraphasic errors. High and low frequency
naming intact. No dysarthria. No apraxia or neglect.

- Cranial Nerves - [II] PERRL 3->2.5. Resists examination for
fundoscopy. [III, IV, VI] Moves eyes laterally in both
directions
to command, but does not move eyes up or down. [V] Corneal
reflexes present when brushing eyelids bilaterally. [VII] No
facial asymmetry noted at rest or when speaking.

- Motor - Normal bulk. Normal tone in the upper extremities but
increased tone (rigidity) in the bilateral lower extremities.
Unable to test with confontrational methods prior to intubation,
but he provided full strength resistance with his proximal
muscles (shoulder, elbow, hip flexors) per report of the six
EMS/ED staff members who were restraining him.

- Sensory - Withdraws to noxious stimuli equally in both arms
and
legs.

- Reflexes

CXR [**1-5**]: Persistent left basilar opacity may represent
atelectasis, aspiration or pneumonia. Feeding tube port ends
higher than the gastroesophageal junction.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**]: 1. Large left temporoparietal intraparenchymal hematoma
with intraventricular extension is redemonstrated. No abnormal
enhancement is identified on the present scan to suggest an
underlying mass lesion or vascular malformation. However, a
repeat MRI with contrast may be obtained once hemorrhage
resolves to assess for underlying lesion. Multiple foci of
abnormal susceptibility are seen in bilateral cerebral
hemispheres which likely represent microhemorrhages associated
with hypertension.

CT/CTA head [**1-1**]: : Stable predominantly intraaxial
temporoparietal hemorrhage with intraventricular, subdural, and
subarachnoid extension and significant mass effect. Normal CTA
of the head, specifically without evidence of vascular
malformation or aneurysm.

EEG [**1-1**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG, because of the
presence of bifrontally predominant intermittent rhythmic delta
activity (FIRDA). This finding can be seen in hydrocephalus, and
also in encepha
