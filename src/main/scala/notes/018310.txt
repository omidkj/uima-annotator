This is a 62 year old female with PMH significant for multiple

 Describes having constant epigastric pain that is burning in
nature and worsened with eating; however somewhat better with
milk. The pain is non-positional in nature and is not
exacerbated by recumbency. States that spicy food exacerbates
her pain.  Reports some associated nausea but no vomiting and
also reports constipation.  In addition, the patient has had
increasing dysphagia for both solids and liquids the last few
months, a video swallow study in [**6-7**] was largely unremarkable.
Denies recent weight loss and reports a good appetite.

Pt also reports feeling increasingly shortness of breath over
the past 3-4 months.  As she is wheelchair bound, she can't say
for sure that this is exertional. Denies PND, orthopnea, h/o LE

chronic in nature but has increased in frequency in the past few
weeks.

Given GI cocktail with improvement in abdominal pain. CXR
significant for RUL mass, sent for chest CT that revealed a 3.7
x 2.4 cm non-cavitating, enhancing mass in the RUL of the lung
abutting the R side of the mediastinum. Pt admitted to medicine
for further work-up of lung mass.

.
CXR - 1.  No free intraperitoneal air.
2.  4-cm mass within the right upper lung zone.  Further
evaluation of this with a CT scan should be obtained.
.
Chest CT - 1.  Approximately 3.7 x 2.4 cm noncalcified,
noncavitating enhancing mass in right upper lobe abutting the
right side of the mediastinum, with possible area of assocaited
post- obstructive subsegmental atelectasis. There is no
pathologically enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
These findings are concerning for a primary bronchogenic
carcinoma that may be accessible to
tiisue diagnosis by transbronchial biopsy. 2.  4-mm nonspecific
noncalcified subpleural nodule within the right lower lobe.
Second possible smaller nodule in the right lower lobe. 3.  Tiny
hypodensity in the right lobe of the liver is too small to
characterize.


Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo F c multiple sclerosis, chronic LBP, initially presents
with hypercarbic respiratory distress, then intubated, trached
and found to have NSCLC.
.
# Lung cancer - Biopsy of the right upper lobe mass result came
back as nonsmall cell lung cancer and it is Stage III by mass
size. Oncology saw patient while in house. No treatment will be
offered given her prognosis and co-morbidity. Her husband had
refused to talk to oncology as inpatient. No staging had been
done due to husband's refusal to talk about her cancer. She will
be followed by oncology as outpatient as necessary for possible
palliative treamtment in the future.
.
# Respiratory failure-Patient initiailly presents with
hypercarbic respiratory failure and aspiration due to multiple
sclerosis. SHe was eventually intubated. Weaning had been
unsuccessful due mostly to muscles weakness from multiple
sclerosis. She had tracheostomy while in ICU. SHe will require
long term ventilatory support since her multiple sclerosis is
progressive. She is on pressure support on discharge. Her trach
had been downsized to size 7 prior to discharge to faciliate
ventilator assisted speech. She does have a lot of anxiety,
needs ativan prn and needs reassurance and training with speech
and swallow.
.
# Dysphagia/aspiration - Patient has significant aspiration per
studies by speech and swallow. However, patient is very eager to
eat. GIven her bad prognosis from her lung cancer and multiple
sclerosis, she needs to be evaluated by speech and swallow
again. If she insists on eating, she needs to understand the
aspiration riskk and the potential mortality from that.
.
# Multiple Sclerosis - Per most recent [**Month/Day (1) **] note, pt with
progressive cognitive decline requiring assitance with most
ADLs. [**Month/Day (1) 878**] recommended to discontinue Avonex treatment
given no clear benefit. Continue supportive management.
.
# urinary tract infection
She was found to have enterobacter UTI and was started on
bactrim to complete 7 days course(d1= [**11-17**])
.
# Chronic LBP - Currently stable. Continue lidoderm patch.
.
# Code - Full, confirmed with pt and husband.
