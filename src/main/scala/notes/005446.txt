IMAGING:
MRI [**2-1**]
1. Large mass centered in the inferior lateral aspect of the
right posterior fossa, which may be intra- or extra-axial. If
the lesion is intra-axial, metastatic disease is the main
consideration, especially given the second focus in the
posterior aspect of the right temporal lobe. Metastatic disease
could be a differential consideration if this lesion is
extra-axial as well, though meningioma would also be a
consideration. This however is considered less likely given that
the sigmoid sinus is completely intact and uncompromised by the
mass.

2. There is mass effect on the fourth ventricle as well as mild
tonsillar
herniation and mass effect on the brainstem related to the large
mass and
associated edema from the mass in the right aspect of the
posterior fossa.

Post op Head CT [**2-4**]:
1. Status post right occipital craniectomy and resection of
hyperdense right cerebellar mass, with expected postoperative
pneumocephalus. Small amount of high-density within and
overlying the surgical bed likely represent small amount of
blood products, however, residual tissue from previously
demonstrated hyperdense mass cannot be excluded on the current
study.

2. Mass effect from right cerebellar vasogenic edema is
unchanged, with
partial effacement of the fourth ventricle and right-sided
cerebellar
tonsillar descent.

MRI [**2-5**]:
IMPRESSION: Status post resection of right cerebellar mass
without residual nodular areas of enhancement. Right temporal
tiny enhancing lesion remains as before. No new lesions or acute
infarcts seen. There is mass effect on the fourth ventricle
which has not increased from previous study and there remains
mild dilatation of the ventricles.




Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the ICU for Q2 neuro checks, and was
immediately placed on Dexamethasone and Mannitol, 25g Q6 hours.
The work up of this posterior fossa mass continued on HD #1, as
the patient had an MRI and a CT Torso to rule out any further
metastases. She was found to have a cecal mass, and GI was
consulted. They desired doing a perioperative biopsy during her
OR case, however, the patient deferred at that time, desiring
"one procedure first".  Neuro and Radiation oncology were also
consulted. On [**2-4**] she went to the OR for right posterior fossa
for tumor resection. This procedure was tolerated well.  An EVD
was placed prophylactically in the event of significant
post-operative vascogenic edema.

Post operatively, she did well; specifically, her neurologic
exam reamined intact and her diplopia improved.  Her post op
Head CT did not demonstrate any acute hemorrhage.  She was
transferred out of the ICU to the stepdown until on [**2-5**].

She continued to have an improving neurologic exam, as her CN IV
palsey improved slightly. She remained afebrile.  She was
evaluated by Physical Therapy, who determined she was suitable
for discharge to home with PT services. She left for home on
