Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Thoracic Surgical Service for
evaluation and treatment. On [**2201-3-4**] the patient underwent a
cervical tracheal resection for ideopathic cervical tracheal
stenosis. This went well without complication (reader referred
to the Operative Note for details). After a brief, uneventful
stay in the PACU, the patient was transferred to the ICU on IFV,
NPO and with a Dilaudid PCA for pain. The patient was
hemodynamically stable. A guardian stitch was placed from his
chin to his chest to protect against neck extension, this
remained in place for 7 days.

Neuro: The patient received dilaudid PCA with good effect and
adequate pain control. When tolerating oral intake, the patient
was transitioned to oral pain medications.

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. He was
monitored on telemetry throughout his stay and did not have any
cardiac problems.

Pulmonary: Following his procedure the patient was put on a
strict regimen of around the clock chest PT and nebulizers,
including mucomist and albuterol. He was able to expectorate his
secretions without difficulty and did not have any significant
respiratory issues. Chest-x-rays were unremarkable and he was
ambulatory by POD 2. He underwent a bronchoscopy on POD 7 which
revealed reveals no necrosis or dehiscence at the site of
anastomosis and no tracheal lesions. Following this procedure
the guardian stitch was cut, with appropriate movement of his
neck.
He was discharged with oxygen saturations of 97% room air.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV
fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, and he was monitored
by nursing staff when initiating liquids. He did not have any
difficulty swallowing or any signs/symptoms of aspiration and
his voice was quite strong. He tolerated a soft diet without
problem. His JP drain which was located next to the anastomosis
was removed on POD 3 after taking a soft solid diet. The output
was minimal and serosanguinous - nonconcerning for any cyle
leak. The patient's intake and output were closely monitored,
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary. Electrolytes were
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection. He did not manifest any
concerning signs of infection during his stay.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; no transfusions were required.

Renal: he developed right flank pain on [**2201-3-11**].  Given his
history of right hydronephrosis a pelvic CT which was negative.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled. The patient received discharge teaching and
follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and
agreement with the discharge plan.
