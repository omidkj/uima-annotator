EKG ([**9-5**]): Atrial flutter, ventricular rate 141. Compared to
previous tracing of [**2157-8-31**] cardiac rhythm is now more
suggestive of atrial flutter, although co-existent atrial

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 81yo male with PMH significant for COPD
and PE who presented with 2d history of SOB found to have
increased respiratory effort consistent with COPD flare.  Has
shown improvement in respiratory status. Patient presented with
significant COPD flair, given nebs, and started on IV
solumedrol.  Pt then changed to PO Prednisone.  Pt also started
on Levoquin given a question of consolidation on CXR. Patient
needed ventilatory support with CPAP at times.

On the second day of admission, the patient was noted to have
tachycardia to 120s/130s.  The rhythm was noted to likely be
aflutter with variable block.  His rate was controlled with IV
diltiazem and he was transitioned to PO meds.
.
Pt has history of PE, and he was therapeutic on his coumadin
when he was admitted to the hospital.  His coumadin was held
intermittently while he was in house because his INR was high as
he was started on levofloxacin.
.
He was transferred to the floor and continued to maintain O2
sats >94% on room air.  He, however, continued to be tachypneic
throughout his hospitalization especially while awake.  He was
restarted on tiotropium and salmetrol and continued on nebulizer
treatments.  He was reevaluated by the speech/swallow team and
ground foods and nectar thickened liquids were recommended.  He
regained alertness and was able to interact and answer questions
appropriately. A course of levofloxacin was completed. He
remained for the most part in normal sinus rhythm with several
short periods of tachycardia.  Upon discharge it was decided to
continue metoprolol XL and discontinue Diltiazem and Coumadin.
