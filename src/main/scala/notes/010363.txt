Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
bilateral SDH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p bilateral burr holes for SDH evacuation

History of Present Illness:
85yo RHM on coumadin for A-fib, sustained fall on [**2-/2066**] where
he hit his head.  He was taken to [**Location (un) **] ED where head CT
revealed bilat cystic hygromas. He was scheduled for an MRI
which
was performed two weeks ago and referred to Neurologist (Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]/?[**Hospital3 68**]) who is scheduled to see him this
Friday.  However, Pt fell again ~[**4-11**] and hit the side of his
head and has had increasingly hesitant speech and some
difficulty
ambulating, therefore was referred for an outpatient NCHCT this
afternoon.   Pt was called back to the ED once the films were
read and subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further eval.

CT HEAD IMPRESSION:
1. Acute on chronic bilateral subdural hematomas, no priors
available for comparison to assess for change. Considerable mass
effect with evidence of early downward transtentorial
herniation.
.
CT C-SPINE
IMPRESSION:
1. No fracture or malalignment. Degenerative chages described
above.
2. Calcified right thyroid nodule. Recommend clinical
correlation.
.
[**4-23**]
CT HEAD
IMPRESSION: Status post evacuation of bilateral subdural
hematomas which are now slightly smaller in size. No new areas
of hemorrhage identified. Slight improvement in effacement of
the suprasellar cistern. Slight shift of the septum pellucidum
to the left and partial effacement of the left lateral ventricle
unchanged.
.
[**4-24**] CXR
Increasing left basilar opacification is present adjacent to a
markedly elevated left hemidiaphragm. This may be related to
worsening atelectasis or an area of developing pneumonia.
Asymmetric density at left costophrenic junction is probably due
to degenerative changes accentuated by patient rotation, but
attention to this area on a repeat non-rotated radiograph would
be helpful. Cardiomediastinal contours appear stable allowing
for rotation. Right lung remains clear. Questionable small left
pleural effusion is noted.
.
[**4-25**]
CT HEAD
IMPRESSION:
Slight increase in size of the left-sided subdural hematoma, and
stable appearance of the right-sided subdural hematoma, both of
which appear heterogeneous. Decrease in the amount of
pneumocephalus compared to the most recent prior study. More
effacement involving the suprasellar cistern compared to the
[**4-23**] study, although relatively stable compared to the [**4-22**] study.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-24**], there is again a
striking elevation of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour with
some atelectatic changes above this. The remainder of the lungs
is essentially clear. Little change in the appearance of the
cardiomediastinal silhouette.
IMPRESSION: Little change.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the neurosurgery service with
bilateral SDHs on [**2145-4-22**]. He had been on coumadin for A-Fib
prior to being admitted. The coumadin was stopped and he was
given FFP and vitamin K to reverse his INR. He went to the OR
for bilateral burr holes on [**2145-4-23**]. The surgery went well with
no complications. A cardiology consult was obtained prior to
taking the patient to surgery. He was deemed a low-moderate risk
for surgery. They recommended holding his lasix for 2 days. It
was restarted on [**2145-4-25**]. The patient also had negative cardiac
enzymes.
.
On [**2145-4-24**] the patient was febrile and a CXR revealed pneumonia.
The patient may have aspirated while eating. He was started on
cipro and flagyl. Neurologically the patient was stable. He had
a repeat head CT on [**2145-4-25**] which was stable with no new
hemmorhage. Medicine was consulted for help managing the
pneumonia and CHF. The patient was ultimately transferred to the
medical service later that day.
.
While on the medicine service the patient was continued on a 10
day course of cipro/flagyl and remained afebrile throughout.
Urine and blood cultures were negative. He was kept NPO and on
aspiration precautions while his mental status improved. During
this time of understandable poor po intake his sodium rose to
150 and he was treated with D5W. Lasix was held. His
electrolytes abnormalities were aggressively corrected and his
mental status improved. On [**4-28**] speech and swallow evaluated the
patient and deemed him safe to eat a pureed diet. On [**4-29**] he was
eating well with acceptable po intake. Electrolytes were much
improved and lasix was restarted in [**Hospital1 **] dosing instead of his
previous daily dosing due to the diuretic braking effect
experienced with daily lasix dosing.
.
His atrial fibrillation was difficult to control and required
progressive increase of his beta blocker. His blood pressure
tolerated this uptitration well. He remained off of warfarin for
7 days per post-op neurosurgical protocol.  Warfarin was
restarted on [**2145-4-30**] at his previous dose of 2.5 mg qPM.
.
His foley catheter was d/c'ed on [**4-27**] and the patient voided
without problem (although he was incontinent) until [**4-29**], when he
was noted not have voided during the overnight shift. He was
bladder scanned which reveal 1 liter of retained urine. He was
straight cathed with good effect and was subsequently able to
urinate. On [**2145-4-30**] he developed abdominal pain, a foley catheter
was inserted with >1.5 L. He will be discharged with a foley
catheter.
.
On [**4-29**] he developed diarrhea and a new WBC count. A C Diff assay
was sent and was negative x3. He has abdominal pain on [**5-1**]. KUB
was consistent with ileus, and once foley was inserted and >1.5L
removed, patient had 5 sponteneous bowel movements, formed.
Abdominal pain improved. KUB also improved.
.
During his stay on the medicine service he received DVT ppx with
sQ heparin and havd GI ppx with a bowel regimen and a crushable
PPI.

He developed a-fib with RVR, hypotension and hct drop and was
transferred to the MICU, Rate control with nodal blockade had
been difficult given hypotension. CHADS2 score is 4 (CHF, HTN,
Age, DM), suggesting a high risk of thromboembolic disease and
pt had been anti-coagulated as outpt. This had been discontinued
