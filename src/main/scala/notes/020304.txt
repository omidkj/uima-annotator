Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8850**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic with seizure and borderline
blood pressures.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 35970**] is a 56-year-old woman with anaplastic
astrocytoma who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for whole brain radiation on
[**2122-1-4**]. She had and episode of fainting on day prior to
admission, and was found to be orthostatic (90's systolic to
70's systolic) in Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic. Recently, she was seen on
Friday for shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain, found
to have pan-sensitive Klebsiella in urine, also with small
segemental pulmonary embolism in RLL, for which she was given
Lovenox. She was also recently diagnosed with pneumomia on
[**2122-1-1**] and was started on levofloxacin as an outpatient. She
also had a recent MRI of her brain/spine that was concerning for
leptomeningeal spread of her cancer, therefore the plan was to
do brain and spine irradiation.

She had had several episodes of "fainting" previously, usually
preceded by feeling of lightheadedness. According to the
husband, has rigidity for approximately 10-30 seconds after she
passes out, and then is completely at baseline (no confusion, no
loss of bowel/bladder).

Since being admitted, OMED team was treating her for her
klebsiella UTI with cefepime. She also had an elevated lactate
to 5 and so there was concern of sepsis and antibiotics were
broadened to cefepime + Vancomycin. She was also started on
heparin IV for treatment of her PE. On [**2123-1-6**] she was
unresponsive. She was slow to respond but no focal neuro
findings. CT head was obtained to rule out bleed given she was
on heparin. She had another episode of unresponsiveness and  was
stood up and had urinary incontinence and kept falling to the
right. Team was then for a third episode of unresponsiveness,
and attending was already in room. Nystagmus and twiching of R
arm was noted. Dilantin load 1g given, and ativan IV 0.5 x2 for
presumed seizure. BP dropped to 86/50 during this episode. She
stopped seizing and was sent to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for monitoring.

Past Medical History:
Anaplastic astrocytoma:  Diagnosed in [**11-1**], s/p VP shunt [**11-1**],
thought initially to be CNS lymphoma and was treated for that.
Brain biopsy in [**11-2**] confirmed diagnosis of anaplastic
astrocytoma. MRI showed leptomenigeal enhancement. Started on
whole brain cranial irradiation and temozolomide on [**2122-12-23**].

Social History:
The patient was a nurse at an [**Hospital3 **] facility.  She is
married.  She is not currently a smoker, previously smoked 1
pack of cigarettes per day for 4 years; she quit smoking 25
years ago.  There is no ETOH or IVDA history.

Family History:
Her brother died from astrocytoma 10 years after diagnosis.  Her
mother has hypertension while her father died of congestive
heart failure.

Physical Exam:
Vital Signs:  Temperature is 97.4 F, blood pressure 124/61,
heart rate 103, respiratory rate 17, and oxygen saturation 98%
on 2L via nasal cannula.
General: unresponsive to painful stimulus
HEENT: pupils equal 5mm and reactive. OP clear.
Neck: No JVD appreciated.
Heart: Tachycardic, regular rhythm. No murmurs/rubs/gallops
Lungs: CTA bilaterally, no wheezes, no rales
Abdomen: + BS. Soft, non-tender, non-distended. No HSM.
Extremities: 2+ DP pulses bilaterally, no edema in extremities

Neurological Examination: She is not awake or alert. There is no
verbal output. Cranial Nerve Examination:  Her pupils are
unequal, with left pupil at 4 mm and it is poorly reactive to
light, while it is 3 mm on right and reactive to light briskly.
She does not have doll's eyes. Her face is symmetric.  Corneal
reflexes are positive bilaterally. Motor Examination:  She can
move the right upper and right lower extremities but there is
almost no movement on the left.  There is paratonia in both
upper and lower extremities.  Her reflexes are 2+ at biceps,
brachioradialis bilaterally.  Her tricep jerks are 2-.  her knee
jerks are 3+ while ankle jerks are 4+.  Her toes are equivocal
on the right and up on the left. Sensory examination is unclear
as she is minimally responsive to painful stimuli. She cannot
walk.

Pertinent Results:
Urine Cx [**2123-1-1**]: KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE. >100,000 ORGANISMS/ML.
Pan-sensitive.

CSF [**2122-12-15**]: WBC 45, RBC 485, Polys 6, Lymphs 34, Monos 60
BETA-2-MICROGLOBULIN = 3.8 MG/L
TOTAL PROTEIN 2690

CTA [**2123-1-1**]: 1. Small segmental pulmonary embolism in the right
lower lobe. No evidence of infarction. 2. New hiatal hernia. 3.
Stable liver hemangiomas, left adrenal adenoma, pulmonary
nodules, and ventriculoperitoneal shunt. 4. Gas in bilateral
renal collecting systems, please correlate with recent
instrumentation.
5. Circumferential enhancement around the spinal cord which may
relate to patient's leptomeningeal enhancement concerning for
metastatases seen on recent MR [**1-3**].

MRI [**2122-12-30**] Spine: 1) New diffuse thick leptomeningeal
enhancement involving the entirety of the cervical, thoracic,
and lumbar spine with a dorsal extramedullary intradural lesion
at the T2/3 level which is indenting the dorsal cord. 2) 2-cm
enhancing lesion involving the cord at the T3/4 level and a
smaller 0.9- cm enhancing lesion at the T5 level. 3) Edema and
expansion of the cord extending from the C7 to the T6 level. 4)
Above findings are concerning for metastasis.

MRI Head [**2122-12-15**]: Worsening diffuse enhancing leptomeningeal
disease which involves the brainstem, the cerebellar vermis, the
corpus callosum and nearly all the midline structures in
addition to the leptomeninges surrounding the brainstem and the
upper cervical cord. The central lesion superior to the mid
brain has slightly enlarged in size since the previous exam.
Worsening diffuse leptomeningeal neoplastic process.

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, Ms. [**Known lastname 35970**] is a 56-year-old woman, well-known to the
OMED team with anaplastic astrocytoma, who was initially
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for orthostasis discovered during a whole
brain radiation treatment. Three days prior to admission, she
was found to have a Klebsiella UTI and segmental pulmonary
embolism on Lovenox. The night of admission, she was found to
have an elevated lactate, and she continued to be orthostatic,
so she was started on cefepime/vancomycin for concern for
sepsis. The morning of [**2123-1-6**], she was found to have seizures.
A stat head CT showed no change. She received 1 gram of
Dilantin, 10 mg IV dexamethasone, and 1 mg lorazepam and
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for observation. EEG was performed and
showed no seizure activity.

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], Dilantin was held given a slightly high level
corrected for albumin, Lamictal was discontinued, and she was
loaded with Keppra. Anticoagulation was held given concern for
bleed, non-symptomatic. Benzos were held given risk of
respiratory depression (DNR/DNI). Antibiotics were d/c'd after
one full week course of treatment. She was transferred back to
7-[**Hospital Ward Name 1950**] for further treatment.

Her mental status continued to improve, but on [**2123-1-13**] she had
more seizure-like activity. EEG was negative. She was loaded
with Dilantin, and levels were followed throughout the
admission. An MRI showed minor improvement in the enhancing
masses, but this was attributed to steroid treatment. The
decision was made to forego further treatment, and she was
accepted at an inpatient hospice facility.
