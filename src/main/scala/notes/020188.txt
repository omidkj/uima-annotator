Pertinent Results:
[**2160-8-5**] Intraop TEE:
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated. A left-to-right
shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest. A secundum
type atrial septal defect is present. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending, transverse
and descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Post Bypass: Patient is in sinus rhythm on no pressors.
Preserved biventricular function, LVEF >55%. The atrial septum
appears thickened post repair. There is turbulent flow around
the seputm without flow visible across by color doppler. Aortic
contours intact. Remaining exam is unchanged. All findings
discussed with surgeon at the time of the exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent minimally invasive
closure of her patent foramen ovale.Cardiopulmonary Bypass
time=74 minutes.Please refer to DR[**Doctor Last Name 14333**] operative
report for further surgical details.She tolerated the procedure
well and was extubated in the operating room prior to transfer
to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Preoperative medications
were resumed. She maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred
to the SDU on postoperative day one. She remained in a normal
sinus rhythm. She had adequate pain control with Ultram and
Toradol. On post-op day four she complained of dizziness and her
lasix was discontinued since her weight was only slightly about
her pre-operative weight and her blood pressure was systolically
running from the high 90s to low 100s.  She felt better by the
end of the day and was discharged to home.
