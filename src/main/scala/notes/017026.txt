History of Present Illness:
HPI: Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 78  year-old right-handed woman on coumadin
and asa for history of CVA, 4 years ago
who presents from an OSH s/p fall last night with a new IPH.
History obtained from Son and [**Name2 (NI) 90692**]. Patient has
expressive aphasia and R hemiplegia from a stroke in [**2096**].
Last
night around 1:30 pm she got up to use the bathroom.  Son found
her propped between wall and comode.  He helped her back to bed
and she seemed only to complain of her right elbow.  This
morning
when the health aides arrived they noted her listing to the left
which was her former strong side.   With this concern they took
her to an OSH.
Head CTwas done at OSH which showed a 3cm IPH. She was given 2
units of FFP and 5mg vitamin K and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further managment.

Otherwise she has had no other complaints.  She did fall,
injuring her back 3-4 months ago.  She also had a significant
pneumonia over the winter, but otherwise has been recently
healthy.   She denies headache, visual changes.  Denies focal
numbness, parasthesiae. No bowel or bladder incontinence or
retention. Uses a hemiplegic walker for ambulation.  She also
eats normal foods, without aspiration.

On general review of systems, the pt denies recent fever or
chills.  No night sweats or recent weight loss or gain. Denies
cough, shortness of breath.  Denies chest pain or tightness,
palpitations.  Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation
or
abdominal pain.  No recent change in bowel or bladder habits.
No
dysuria.  Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Denies rash.

Pertinent Results:
NCHCT [**2100-9-1**] IMPRESSION:
1. Interval mild increase in the size of a right parenchymal
hemorrhage as
described above. A few small hypodense foci within may relate to
ongoing
hemorrahage. Causes may include trauma, coagulopathy, amyloid
angiopathy,
underlying lesion, etc.
2. Changes in the left frontal lobe can be subacute-chronic.
These can be better assessed with MR, MRA if not
contra-indicated after
clinical correlation.
3. Diffuse sclerosis of the bones- correlate with metabolic
parameters.

CXR [**2100-9-1**] FINDINGS: The lung volumes are normal. There are no
pleural effusions.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.
The slightly increased vascular diameter and the multiple
interstitial bilateral markings suggest mild-to-moderate
pulmonary edema. No focal parenchymal opacity suggesting
pneumonia. Valvular ring calcifications. Right pectoral
pacemaker in situ.

NCHCT [**2100-9-2**] 1. No significant interval change from prior study.
Foci of parenchymal hemorrhage in the right temporoparietal
region and right inferior insular cortex, unchanged from prior
study with no areas of new hemorrhage.
2. Area of hypodensity in the left frontal lobe likely
representing prior
infarcts.
3. Correlate clinically for need of further workup for
underlying cause of
hemorrhage, that is possibly best evaluated via MRI.

TTE [**2100-9-3**] - The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated given small body size.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. There is mild
global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40-45%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. Severe
(4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe mitral regurgitation. Mildly dilated left
ventricle with at least mild global systolic dysfunction.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate to severe pulmonary
hypertension.

NCHCT [**2100-9-4**] IMPRESSION: No interval change in known right
temporoparietal and inferior insular cortex intraparenchymal
hemorrhages. No new hemorrhage.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo W h/o prior L MCA stroke (residual Rhemiplegia, aphasia),
DM2, past tobacco use, s/p PPM p/w L-sided weakness s/p fall on
[**8-31**], resulting in a R IPH and small SAH.

[] Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage - She was noted the next morning
to be leaning primarily to her left (her strong side) and was
subsequently brought to the hospital where the hemorrhage was
found on imaging. She was awake and oriented (could nod yes or
no) and had new mild left sided weakness ([**5-4**]) with her prior
residual productive aphasia and R face, arm, and leg weakness.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care after receiving
FFPs and Vitamin K. Her INR was 2.7 prior to 2 units of FFPs and
1.9 after, so she was given an additional 2 units of FFPs. While
in the ED, she experienced a brief 2 minute convulsive seizure
and was subsequently started on Levetiracetam 500 q12h. Her
repeat NCHCT at that time showed a very small amount of
expansion from her prior outside hospital NCHCT. Her repeat
NCHCTs on [**9-2**] and [**9-4**] showed no further expansion of the
IPH/hematoma or SAH. Her INR has remained stable in the 1.2-1.3
range. Her neurologic exam had been challenging as she was
originally very hyperactive and agitated off sedation and
subsequently has been more lethargic (possibly due to quetiapine
