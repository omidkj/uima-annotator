HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 70-year-old female with a
known history of coronary artery disease status post
myocardial infarction in [**2135**] had a normal ejection fraction
at that time of 60 percent.  She had shortness of breath and
a hematocrit of 20 in the recent past with a resulting chest
pain.  This drop in hematocrit required six units of blood
products transfusion.  Echocardiogram revealed at that time
severe pulmonary hypertension and worsening mitral valve
regurgitation.  The patient had an apparent history of
gastrointestinal arteriovenous malformation which could be
problem[**Name (NI) 115**] for any operative anticoagulation long-term with
the potential need for mechanical valve.  The patient also
was status post thoracentesis on [**2142-10-4**], three days prior
to admission, with 500 cc removed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Arteriovenous malformation of
gastrointestinal tract ascending colon.

Diverticulitis with internal hemorrhoids.

Coronary artery disease with myocardial infarction in [**2135**].

Pseudogout.

Osteoporosis.

Anemia.

Fibromyalgia.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Chronic renal insufficiency.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Three total hip arthroplasties.

Back surgery.

Total abdominal hysterectomy.

Colonoscopy with endoscopy last week for polyp removal.

ALLERGIES:  The patient was allergic to penicillin for which
she had anaphylaxis and morphine which gave her an itch.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She had no smoking or alcohol history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination at admission,
temperature was 97.8, heart rate 67, respiratory rate 18,
blood pressure 122/57, sating 95 percent on room air.  She
was alert and oriented in no apparent distress.  Her lungs
were clear bilaterally.  She had S1, S2 with a holosystolic
murmur.  Abdomen was soft, nontender and nondistended with
positive bowel sounds.  Her extremities were warm and well
perfused without any swelling or cellulitis.  She was guaiac
negative on a rectal examination.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was admitted to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2546**] service for
preoperative evaluation for her known coronary artery disease
for potential mitral valve repair versus replacement and
coronary artery bypass graft.  Gastrointestinal consultation
was requested to evaluate the patient's six unit
gastrointestinal bleed with known arteriovenous malformation
of her colon in light of the need for heparinization
systemically for cardiopulmonary bypass.  The patient was
seen by general surgery team, which also recommended the SB
capsule endoscopy and whether or not it was reasonable to re-
scope the patient or just do a capsular camera study to
evaluate her intestinal tract.  This was discussed with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  He recommended a gastrointestinal evaluation
with repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy and
then a capsule study as planned.  On house day two, the
patient had some mild mid chest pain with radiation to her
left back.  She was in sinus rhythm with a stable
hemodynamically sating 98 percent on room air.  She continued
on Lopressor, Zocor, gabapentin, [**Doctor First Name **], Protonix and her
nitroglycerin paste.  She was awaiting a chest x-ray,
echocardiogram and labs as well as cardiology consultation
and final recommendations from the gastrointestinal service.
The patient was seen by cardiology.  In preparation for her
workup, a cardiac catheterization showed 90 percent osteal
ramus branch stenosis.  Echocardiogram was ordered to
evaluate her mitral valve and rule out any endocarditis.  The
patient continued on her beta blocker.  Recommendations from
cardiology were appreciated.  The patient was also seen by
gastrointestinal medical fellow, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**].  Results of the
gastrointestinal consultation was that it would be necessary
to have the patient have a capsule camera study of her
intestinal tract.  The patient was also seen in consultation
by case management and the hepatobiliary surgery team and
actually waited on the service for approximately a week
awaiting the SB capsule study.  The patient remained stable
on the service.  She had an echocardiogram which showed
moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with preserved
ejection fraction which was improved from her echocardiogram
at the outside hospital at [**Hospital3 1280**].  Cardiology
recommendations were also appreciated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and
this was also discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1295**]
from cardiology.  The decision was made to bring the patient
to the operating room for mitral valve replacement, coronary
artery bypass graft, as ramus stenosis predated the MR and
was not felt to be contributory.  The patient remained on the
floor without any gastrointestinal bleeding over the next
several days awaiting the arrival of the capsule.  The
patient also had some complaints of right shoulder pain, but
this was evaluated as well as her anemia.  Her capsule study
continued to be delayed due to no availability of a
cardiology capsule.  The creatinine remained stable at 1.3.
The hematocrit was 36.9.  On house day four, the patient was
also consulted by the dental service as we waited for the
arrival of the small bowel capsule.  The patient was also
seen by case management.  The patient also said that her
shoulder pain predated this admission, and it was treated
with Tylenol number 3 in the hospital.  A dental consultation
was scheduled for [**10-12**] as well as a Panorex film of
the mouth to rule out any occult dental disease.  The patient
was cleared by dental on [**2142-10-12**] for her valve
replacement.  The capsule arrived on [**2142-10-15**], and the
patient was scheduled to have the small bowel capsule study
on the following morning.  Preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] of the results
of the capsule study on [**2142-10-17**] were two cecal colonic
arteriovenous malformations which were not actively bleeding
and a foreign body in the small bowel with a question of
fibrous material versus the coffee stirring straw.

Pr[**Last Name (STitle) **]tive labs are as follows:  Sodium 140, potassium 0.0,
chloride 106, bicarb 27, BUN 12, creatinine 1.2 with a blood
sugar of 91, white count 3.9, hematocrit 34.8, platelet count
262, magnesium 2.1.  Urinalysis was negative.  The patient's
hematocrit remained stable.  Electrocardiogram showed sinus
bradycardia.  Chest x-ray showed bilateral small effusions
with some apical scarring.  On [**2142-10-19**], the patient went
to the operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting times one and mitral valve
replacement with a vein graft to the ramus and a 25 mm
[**Company 1543**] Mosaic porcine valve.  The patient was transferred
to cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on
Neo-Synephrine drop at 0.3 mcg/kg/minute, propofol drip at 20
mcg/kg/minute and an epinephrine drip at 0.02 mcg/kg/minute.
On postoperative day one, the patient was hemodynamically
stable with blood pressure of 137/89 in sinus rhythm at 87.
She had been extubated overnight and remained on
nitroglycerin drip at 2.5 mcg/kg/minute and an epinephrine
drip at 0.01 mcg/kg/minute.  Postoperative labs as follows:
White count 15.1, hematocrit 37.1, platelet count 167,000,
potassium 4.6, BUN 11, creatinine 1.0.  The patient had a
neurologically nonfocal examination.  She had decreased
breath sounds at both bases.  Incisions were clea
