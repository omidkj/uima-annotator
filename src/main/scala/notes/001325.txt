Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, difficulty sleeping

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
47 yo M hx CAD s/p MI, DM II, who presented to OSH c/o
difficulty sleeping for the last 2-3 weeks, associated with some
difficulty breathing. The pt notes he has been having difficulty
staying asleep, wakes up at night and has to sit at the side of
the bed. He notes difficulty with lying flat, but denies actual
SOB. In addition, he has been getting SOB with minimal activity,
and recently has PFTs done by his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] notes increased cough
and some increased sputum production over the last few days, no
fever or chills. He denies any episodes of chest pain, although
did have some L jaw pain 3days ago, relieved with NTG x1, lasted
several minutes. His MI in '[**83**] was associated with severe CP, L
arm pain and L jaw pain.
The pt initially presented to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital where an ABG was
7.19/96/83. He was also noted to be hypoxemic to 80's on RA. He
was placed on BiPAP. In addition, cardiac enzymes were drawn and
troponin T noted to be 0.7. He was given ASA, lovenox SC,
solumedrol, lasix 40mg IV and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. No ECG
changes were noted.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED, repeat ABG was 7.24/78/64 with HCO3 of
32. He was continued on BiPAP, CXR was felt to show CHF, given
additional lasix 20mg IV with total response of 700cc urine out,
and transferred to MICU

.
ECG: NSR, right axis, nl intervals, small Q in III, aVF, no ST
or T wave changes
.
CXR: mild CHF, elevated L diaphragm.
.
Echo [**5-/2183**]: Preserved left ventricular systolic function. Normal
valvular function.
.
Exercise MIBI [**5-/2184**]:
IMPRESSION: Exercise myocardial perfusion scan is performed and
read without comparison and demonstrates an ejection fraction of
57% with normal wall motion. There is normal perfusion during
rest and stress imaging.
.
Cath [**5-/2183**]:
1. Coronary arteriography of this right dominant system reveals
two vessel disease. The left main is normal. The LAD has mild
luminal irregularities. The left circumflex has a long 90%
stenosis in its mid portion, with thrombus and appearance of
plaque rupture. The flow was TIMI 2. The OM1 is tiny and
diffusely diseased. The OM2 has a distal 60% stenosis. The OM3
has a proximal 30% stenosis. The RCA is dominant and diffusely
diseased up to 60% in its mid portion.
2. Hemodynamic measurements reveal elevated filling pressures,
with mean RA of 15 mmHg, mean PCWP of 26 mmHg, PA 42/26 mmHg.
The cardiac index, SVR, and PVR are within normal limits.
3. The right iliac was subtottally occluded just proximal to the
bifurcation of the femoral artery and could not be crossed with
[**Last Name (un) 25836**]
wire. Therefore, the left femoral artery approach was used.
4. Successful acute PTCA and Stenting of Mid Circumflex.
.
CXR [**2191-1-10**]: Mild congestive heart failure, elevated L
diaphragm.
.
CXR [**2191-1-11**]: Left hemidiaphragm is elevated and could be
paralyzed or eventrated. Mild pulmonary edema and small left
pleural effusion are present. Heart size is top normal. Fullness
in the right lower paratracheal region is probably due to
distended mediastinal veins.
.
Echo [**2191-1-10**]: The left atrium is mildly elongated. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Free wall motion is
depressed (?mild). The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve is grossly normal. No
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall
hypokineiss. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Preserved
global left ventricular systolic function. Is there a history to
suggest a primary pulmonary process (e.g., pulmonary embolism,
COPD, bronchospasm, etc.)
.
CTA [**2191-1-10**]: 1. Study limited by motion and bolus timing with no
definite evidence of segmental or main pulmonary artery
embolism.
2. Opacity in the left lower lobe with shift in the major
fissure posteriorly consistent with near total
collapse/atelectasis.
3. Opacities in the inferior lingula and right lower lobe also
suggestive of atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
  A&P: 47 yo M hx CAD, DM p/w mild dyspnea, orthopnea x [**3-12**]
weeks, with hypercarbia, hypoxia and new Aa gradient and right
heart failure.
.
1 Hypercarbia - appears to be acute on chronic based on his ABG
and bicarbonate. Likely his pCO2 baseline elevated (mid 60's).
This may be [**3-11**] chronic COPD with concominant OSA/obesity
hypoventialaion that may have been acutely exacerbated by left
hemidiaphragm paresis or acute bronchitis. He was seen by sleep
medicine and set up for outpatient sleep study. Additionally he
was started on BIPAP in house with settings of 9/5cm H2O, that
he was minimally compliant with while here. He was set up to
have home BIPAP on discharge. He was also started on albuterol
and iprtropium. He was started on azi
