Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
PEA arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

placement of left PICC
tracheostomy

History of Present Illness:
68 y/o m with htn, dm2, hyperlipidemia, osa presented to the ed
with three months of increasing abominal swelling and one week
of nausea. He had recently returned from a trip, and his
daughter felt he didn't look right, appearing ill and fatigued,
so he was brought into the ED. Here he primarily complained of
pain relating to his le and scrotal swelling. He was taken to
ultrasound where he became increasingly confused, was brought
back to the ED, where he became bradycardic to the 20's. He got
atropine and then went first into asystole, then pea, was
intubated/coded and recovered, with an initial gas showing a
profound respiratory acidosis (7.16/86/332). His wife states
that over the past week he has been nauseated but has had no
other complaints, f/c, chest pain, sob, diarrhea. He has had a
dry cough for the past few months.

1.)Hypertension
2.)DM2
3.)Hyperlipidemia

MICU admission and NIMV

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2192-8-22**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Severe symmetric LVH. Small LV cavity.
Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Low
normal LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV function depressed.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. No AS. No
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Trivial
MR. LV inflow
pattern c/w impaired relaxation.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Moderate PA
systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is severe symmetric
left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Due
to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. The ascending
aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is moderate
pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: Assess interval change.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old man with CHF, VAP, s/p trach placement, trach cuff
previously hyperinflated. Assess interval change.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Assess interval change.
AP CHEST, [**9-1**] AT 04:29 HOURS

HISTORY: CHF. Trach placement. Cuff previously hyperinflated.

IMPRESSION: AP chest read with chest radiographs since
[**2192-8-29**], most recently [**8-31**] at 16:36 hours:

Pulmonary edema has largely cleared and moderate cardiomegaly
has improved. Bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right is
unchanged. Tracheostomy tube is in standard placement. Right
PICC catheter projects over the SVC and a feeding tube passes
into the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
