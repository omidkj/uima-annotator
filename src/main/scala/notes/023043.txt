History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 916**] is a 73 year old female with a PMH of MI, HTN, CHF
Ischemic CM (EF 15%), VT/VF s/p AICD in '[**94**], AFib (on Coumadin)
who has been more fluid overloaded for 2 weeks and was recently
started on Zaroxolyn in addition to her standind Lasix. Last
Thurs, [**5-21**] she was on the toilet and fell to the floor. She does
not recall falling, but awoke in a pool of blood. She was
brought to [**Hospital3 628**] where she was evaluated by the EP
service who interrogated her pacer and was found to have been
shocked at the time of her fall. On [**5-22**], she had 3 further
shocks at the OSH. Her interrogation showed VT at a rate of
210ms. An ECHO revealed EF 15-20% with severe global HK with 2+
MR and 3+ TR and moderate [**Last Name (un) 6879**]. She was aggressively diuresed
throughout her admission and started on Aldactone. One day prior
to transfer, she awoke nauseated and vomited. She later fell
again from a chair and was found unresponsive with agonal
breathing and no pulse. She was externally shocked x 1 with
360J, given Epi and Mg and returned to narrow complex tachy and
she was subsequently intubated and transferred to the ICU. She
was extubated a few hours later without event and has remained
stable since. She is now transferred for EP evaluation and
possible VT ablation with planned generator change.

[**5-30**] Abd X ray
FINDINGS: The bowel gas pattern is nonobstructed and nonspecific
with no evidence of free air or pneumatosis. Copious stool
visualized in the right colon and now extending into the
transverse colon. There are some calcific densities projecting
over the right iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**], which could be renal stones or
calcified mesenteric lymph nodes.
.
[**6-3**] Renal U/S FINDINGS: The kidneys are normal in size,
echogenicity, and contour. Right kidney measures 10.1 cm and
left kidney 9.1 cm in greatest craniocaudal dimension. Within
the right kidney, there is a 1.8 cm upper pole simple cyst and a
slightly exophytic 1.9 cm upper pole simple renal cyst. There is
a focal round hyperechoic lesion within the mid-upper pole, just
adjacent to the renal sinus fat that likely represents
calcification in the calyceal system possibly a diverticulum;
this seems more likely than a cortical calcification. No
concerning mass lesions or hydronephrosis within the right
kidney. Within the left kidney, there is a 2.3 cm simple cyst
within the interpolar region and a 2 cm cyst within the upper
pole that is also simple in appearance. Within the upper and the
lower poles, there are similar round hyperechoic foci just
peripheral to the renal sinus, that again likely represent small
calcifications within the collecting system more likely than
cortical calcifications. No hydronephrosis. The urinary bladder
is clutched around a Foley catheter.
IMPRESSION: Normal sized kidneys without hydronephrosis. A
single right and two left calcifications, more likely within
caliceal system than cortical calcifications.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 73 year old female with a PMH of
MI, HTN, CHF Ischemic CM (EF 15%), VT/VF s/p AICD in '[**94**], AFib
(on Coumadin) transferred from OSH for EP evaluation of VT and
generator change to AICD who subsequently developed ARF which
resolved prior to discharge.
.
#Cardiac:
1. Rhythm -
# VT:  Pt had several episodes of VT with subsequent AICD firing
prior to admission.  We diuresed her aggressively upon admission
and she subsequently went to the EP lab on HD #3.  She had her
AICD generator changed at that time without event.  Amiodarone
was started at 400mg PO QD.  She was placed on Keflex for 5 days
s/p EP procedure as prophylaxis against infection.  She remained
in sinus rhythm with no CP until she had another shock due to VT
on [**6-1**] for which she was treated with 150IV Amio x 1 and PO
Amiodarone was increased to 400mg [**Hospital1 **] for planned 7 days total
and then should be switched to 400mg PO daily dosing (in 4
days).  Her AICD was adjusted based on this last shock.  ATP was
increased to 10 beats @ 85% CL.
.
# AFib: This is longstanding.  She remained in sinus rhythm with
no CP.  She was admitted on her home dose of Coumadin but this
was held in anticipation of EP study.  She remained well rate
controlled.  Coumadin was continued but in setting of ARF (see
below), this was held for a three days and restarted prior to
discharge.  She was bridged with a heparin drip in the meantime.
.
2. Ischemia
# CAD: Pt s/p MI in distant past.  S/P Cath at [**Hospital1 112**] in [**2194**].  We
continued her Statin, ACE, BB, ASA continued (but ACE was held
in setting of ARF and restarted prior to discharge when her
renal function improved.)
.
3. Pump
# CHF: Long history of CHF with marked fluid overload.  EF 15%
on ECHO prior to admission at [**Location (un) 620**].  She was diuresed in
anticipation of EP lab for AICD generator change. ACE-I was held
in setting of ARF but ACE was restarted prior to discharge.
Beta blocker was continued throughout admission.
.
4. HTN.  This was well controlled throughout admission with beta
blocker, ace I (except when held- see below). She is being
discharged on 12.5mg PO BID Metoprolol, 2.5mg PO Daily
Lisinopril, Lasix 10mg PO Daily.
.
5. Hypercholesterolemia: Statin was continued throughout
admission as Atorvastatin 20 mg PO DAILY.
.
# ARF: In setting of aggressive diuresis, Ms. [**Known lastname 916**] developed ARF
with a BUN of 44 (peak) and Creatinine of 2.0.  Her urine output
decreased for 3 days and she was gently hydrated with resolution
of urine output as her creatinine trended down.  She was found
to have a UTI by U/A on [**6-3**] for which she was treated with
Ciprofloxacin HCl 250 mg PO Q24H for a planned 7 day total
course.  At time of discharge, she is trending down in terms of
creatinine.  Her urine output is greatly improved.  She needs
BUN/Creatinine checked daily and a repeat U/A to be sent in 3
days along with surveillance cultures.

# Constipation: Pt had slight diste
