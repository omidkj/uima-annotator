Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Zosyn

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Peripherally insterted central catheter
Nasogastric tube


History of Present Illness:
85 M with h/o CVA s/p recent CEA, DM2, CKD and HTN who presents
from [**Hospital1 1501**] with respiratory distress. Although it is not clear
from discharge summary, recent hospitalization complicated by
SICU stay for PNA vs CHF. Unclear if patient was reintubated but
was started on levofloxacin and diamox. Discharged ([**11-28**]) to
complete 2 week course of ciprofloxacin.
.
ROS: denies shortness of breath, fevers, chest pain. reports
only feeling worn and not well. + achy, tired, malaise. Denies
DOE (walks >1 block prior to previous admission with cane), PND.
Stable 2 pillow orthopnea. No ankle edema.
.
ED Course:
In ED, afebrile but briefly hypotension and responded to small
fluid bolus. CXR showed likely PNA and the patient was given a
dose of vanc/CTx. Requiring non-rebreather to maintain
oxygenation. Prior to coming up to the ICU, the patient went
into a fib with RVR (HR to 140s). Started on dilt drip.
.
MICU Course:
Treated for HAP with vanc/levo/flagyl. Respiratory status
improved with decreasing O2 requirement and afebrile. Weaned off
dilt gtt, AFib remained well-controlled on PO beta blocker and
spontaneously converted to sinus. One episode OB+ 'black' stool
but stable Hct and hemodynamics stable.
.
[**Hospital1 **] Course:
He was called out to the floor on [**12-4**]. On the floor he appeared
dyspneic and was diuresed for pulmonary edema, but dyspnea not
completely resolved. He had negative LENIs and V/Q scan with
intermediate probability PE. He also continued to tell the team
that "I want to die". SW was consulted and ritalin was started.
Pt was not taking in POs and creatinine also started trending up
again.  [**2131-12-12**] pt was found to have BP 72/40 and decreased UOP.
He was given a 500 cc bouls and Bps initially trended up to
82/50 and then down to 70/40. He then received an additonal 1 L
fluid bolus and was transferred to the ICU.
.
MICU Course:
He received 7 liters of IVF with improvement of his blood
pressure and subsequent improvement in his mental status.
Psychiatry and neurology were consulted; his perseveration on "I
want to die. Hurry up." did not seem consistent with a diagnosis
of depression, but his behavior did raise concern of frontal
release . Neurology Celexa was stopped as it has been reported
to cause hypotension and is without immediate benefit to the
patient, and at the recommendation of psychiatry, ritalin was
stopped as well.

EKG: sinus, 100bpm, LAD, freq PACs, IVCD similar to prior
.
CXR, portable ([**12-1**])- Large hiatal hernia. Increasing air space
opacities within the left lung and right lower lung zone. There
is no pneumothorax. There are no pleural effusions.
.
TTE ([**12-4**])- The left atrium is normal in size. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and
tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV
diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
CXR ([**12-6**])- The right PICC line tip terminates in the SVC.  The
large hiatal hernia is again demonstrated.  There is worsening
of bilateral infiltrates, suggesting increased degree of
pulmonary edema and also of the underlying pneumonia cannot be
excluded, especially in the right lower lobe and left upper
lobe. Bilateral pleural effusion is small-to-moderate.
.
Bilateral LE U/S ([**12-7**]): No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in
either lower extremity.
.
V/Q scan ([**12-7**]):
INTERPRETATION:  Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol
in 8 views demonstrate central  deposition of the
radiopharmaceutical, due to the turbulent flow. There are
widespread ventilatory abnormalities in RML, RLL, LUL, LLL,
predominantly at lung bases. Perfusion images in the same 8
views show similar pattern of perfusion abnormaliies, also most
pronounced at the bases. Chest x-ray shows diffuse bilateral
infiltrates with similar distribution pattern.
IMPRESSION: Matched perfusion and chest X-ray findings.
Intermediate likelihood ratio for pulmonary embolism.
.
Chest CT, non-contrast ([**12-10**]):
1.  Intrathoracic stomach.
2.  Multifocal pneumonia, most likely aspiration.  Small
bilateral pleural
effusions and subcarinal mediastinal adenopathy, presumably
reactive.
3.  Calcific cholelithiasis.  No evidence of cholecystitis.
.
Head CT, non-contrast ([**12-12**]):
FINDINGS:  The posterior fossa is not well seen on today's
examination
secondary to patient motion artifact.  There is no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage. Old areas of hypodensity seen within
the left external capsule are unchanged compared to [**2131-11-24**],
consistent with chronic lacunar infarction.  A lacunar infarct
within the right caudate nucleus is also unchanged in
appearance. There is no evidence of intracranial mass lesion,
hydrocephalus or shift of normally midline structures.  The
density values of the brain parenchyma are within normal limits.
 The surrounding soft tissues and osseous structures are
unremarkable. The paranasal sinuses appear clear.
IMPRESSION:    No new areas of acute infarction identified.  The
previously reported tiny left parafalcine subdural hematoma seen
on MRI is not seen on today's examination, likely secondary to
interval resorption.
.
Brain, Head, Neck MRI/MRA ([**12-15**]):
FINDINGS:  BRAIN MRI:
Comparison was made with the previous MRI examination of
[**2131-11-23**].  The
previously seen subtle increased signal in the right parafalcine
region in the frontal lobe on diffusion images is again
visualized and appears to be due to T2 shine through.  Mild
periventricular changes of small vessel disease are seen.  There
is no evidence of midline shift, mass effect
