52 y/o male who presented with acute back pain to OSH. CTA
showed an ascending and descending aortic dissection. Pt was
med-flighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical care.
Chest CTA at OSH: Type A dissection involving the entire
thoracic and abdominal aorta. Dissection extends into the right
innominate, both common carotid arteries, and the left
subclavian. The dissection extends to involve the superior
mesenteric artery. The right renal is supplied by the true
lumen. The left renal is supplied by the false lumen. The
aneurysm extends to involve both common iliac arteries. The
right common iliac artery is supplied by the true lumen. The
left common iliac artery is supplied by a nonfilling false lumen
which is severly compressing the true lumen of the left common
iliac artery.

Pertinent Results:
[**2135-3-1**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: 1. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). 2.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. 3.The aortic root is moderately dilated at
the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The
aortic arch is moderately dilated. The descending thoracic aorta
is mildly dilated. Dissection flap noted in the ascending aorta
extending into the arch , into the left subclavian and the
descending aorta. Flow detected in the true and false lumens. 4.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Moderate(2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic
regurgitation jet is eccentric. 5.The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. 6.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
POST-BYPASS: 1. The anterior wall, septum and anterior septum
are mildy hypokinetic (mid esophageal views). RV function is
unchanged. 2. Graft material seen in the ascending aorta. The
distal arch has a dissection flap that extends into the left
subclavian artery. Descending aortic dissection persists with
flow seen in true and false lumens. 3. Trace aortic
insufficiency present. 4. There is mild mitral regurgitation.
[**2135-3-3**] UE U/S: No evidence of any DVT in either upper extremity.

[**2135-3-8**] CXR: The left basilar pleural effusion is stable and the
smaller right-sided basilar pleural effusion has slightly
decreased as compared to two days ago. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette, mediastinal clips and sternotomy wires are
unchanged. The lungs remain otherwise clear. There are clips in
the right axillary region, unchanged as well.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 71211**] was transferred from OSH
to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent surgery. He was brought to the operating
room shortly after admission and underwent a replacement of his
ascending and arch aorta. And with re-anastomosis of the
innominate and left common carotid utilizing a aortobifem graft.
Please see operative report for surgical details. Following
surgery he was transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. He did have some post-operative bleeding
that required multiple blood products. Later following the
operation, he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically
intact and extubated. On post-op day two beta-blockers and
diuretics were initiated. He was gently diuresed towards his
pre-op weight. Beta-blockers were titrated throughout hospital
course for maximum BP control. An upper extremity ultrasound was
performed which ruled out a DVT. He was later transferred to the
telemetry floor. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were
removed per protocol. Over the next several days he continued to
improve and worked with physical therapy for strength and
mobility. He also required aggressive pulmonary toilet. He had a
relatively uneventful post-op course and was discharged on
post-op days seven with VNA services and appropriate follow-up
appointments.
