Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
 Respiratory Failure, worsened systolic HF

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pulmonary Intubation


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 84831**] is a 78-year-old female with a history of atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, CHF with an
EF of 30%, COPD, known AAA who was with her friend she developed
slurred speech on [**10-28**]. Upon presentation to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]
emergency department, her speech was fluent. She had no
neurologic deficits; however, she was found to be hypoxic with
an O2 saturation of 60%. She was intially started on BiPAP then
soon after required intubation for respiratory failure.
.
OSH Echo showed severely reduced left ventricular systolic
function with akinesis of the inferior and inferior lateral
wall, with EF of 15% to 20%. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
greater than 18 mmHg. Given her hypotension, she was not
diuresed initially and
was actually positive 2.4 liters on [**10-29**].  She was initially
started on Levophed; however, this had to be changed to
Neo-Synephrine
as she became tachycardic with a heart rate in the 150s. She was
started on IV amiodarone.  On transfer, all pressors were
weaned.
.
Patient was never diuresed because of hypotension.  She was
ruled out for MI with 3 negative sets of CEs.
.
Patient was thought to have a COPD exacerbation and was treated
with solumedrol, ceftriaxone and azithro for potential
infection.  She has not been producing sputum.

Review of systems could not be obtained on admission as the
patient was intubated.

Brief Hospital Course:
78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, CHF with an EF of 30%, COPD,
known AAA who presented to OSH with hypoxia and reduced EF,
thought to be COPD exacerbation.
.
# Respiratory Failure:
Thought to be COPD exacerbation. Treated with ATC nebulizers,
Azithromycin and Prednisone. Pt was extubated and improved
quickly. On day of discharge, she had finished her antibiotics,
had no wheezes or O2 requirement, able to ambulate in halls
without SOB and had no cough. Sputum culture was positive for
yeast only.
.
# CAD:  Patient has known CAD s/p multiple MIs. We do not have
these records in our system. Outpatient cardiologist at [**Hospital1 **]. Pt was continued on Metoprolol, Aspirin (decreased to 81
mg), Lisinopril. Pt R/O for MI with no evidence of ischemia.
.
# Acute on chronic Systolic congestive Heart Failure:  Patient
has known systolic heart failure with baseline EF of 30%. Most
recent echo showed EF of 15-20%.  Unclear why she has worsening
systolic function. Ruled out for ischemia at OSH. Patient
currently appears euvolemic on exam. Pt had increased LE edema
on day of discharge, thought to be [**3-8**] prednisone therapy.
furosemide was increased to 40 mg daily and pt will f/u with her
cardiologist next week. Daily weights and low Na diet reviewed
with pt.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation:  Rate well controlled. Afib with RVR
induced by levophed at OSH. As a result, patient was loaded with
IV amiodarone but this was not continued after levophed off.
Coumadin restarted at home dose, noted that INR climbed quickely
to high of 3.2 on day of discharge, likely [**3-8**] antibiotic.
Instructed pt to hold coumadin for 2 days, resume on Sunday and
check INR on Monday.
.
#  COPD: Likely COPD exacerbation. Given IV solumedrol 80mg [**Hospital1 **]
at OSH and transitioned to PO taper at time of discharge.
.
# Hyperglycemia: No history per pt.  However with steroids,
sugars have been elevated. Has been getting Lantus 40 units
daily at OSH. Lantus was d/c'ed here and BS improving daily.
Will not send home on meds because of rapid Prednisone taper but
would recheck fast BS and/or glucose challenge after steroids
finished.
.
# Hyponatremia: Na 130 prior to transfer. Resolved
spontaneously.  Appears euvolemic. Patient has new lung nodule,
concerning for malignancy.
.
# Transaminitis with elevated AST, ALT:  resolving with nl AST
at discharge. Crestor restarted.  She underwent an abdominal
ultrasound which revealed dilated hepatic veins and IVC likely
representing increased right heart pressure. AAA was noted at
4.8 x 4.7 cm. Her crestor was held.
-recheck LFT's as outpt.
-follow AAA regularly
.
#.Spiculated 1.8 cm lung mass in the right apical segment
concerning
for malignancy:  This will need a biopsy and further workup once
acute issues have resolved. PCP and pt made aware.

CODE: DNR, confirmed with HCP at OSH. Patient
