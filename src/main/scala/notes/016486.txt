History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 104543**] is a 55 year old female with history of multiple
prior hospitalizations/intubations for asthma exacerbation in
addition to COPD and restrictive lung disease was admitted
yesterday with complaint of shortness of breath for two days
with chills, rhinorrhea, and cough productive of green sputum.
She did not take her temperature but felt warm.  The patient
states that she was in her normal state of health until 1 week
ago.  While returning from a family reunion in [**Location (un) 3844**],
she felt increasingly fatigued, short of breath, and had an
episode of chills.  Her husband had URI symptoms the week
before.  The past 3-4 days, her symptoms have worsened as she
has experienced increased shortness of breath and cough with
green sputum.  She called Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1726**] [**8-7**] and was advised to
come to the ED.  In the ED she was started on her home
medications and was placed on a 100% NRB for oxygen saturation
of 84% on room air.  She had a CXR that showed a left lower lobe
infiltrate and was started on levofloxacin.  She was also given
albuterol nebs and solumedrol. She was admitted to the MICU for
monitoring of her tenuous respiratory status.  She was treated
for exacerbation of asthma in the setting of new community
acquired pneumonia.  This included IV solumedrol,levofloxacin,
and albuterol/ipatropium nebs.

The etiology of her restrictive lung disease is unclear. She had
a negative open lung biopsy in [**2112**] and has a history of over 50
pack years tobacco abuse. She quit smoking in [**2109**]. Currently,
she is dependant on nocturnal BiPAP at home set at 15/5 with
rate of 18 on spontaneous timed mode.  PFTs in [**8-18**] showed FeV1
1.6 (72%), FVC 2.71 (91%), with a ration of 79%.  The total lung
capacity was 108%, RV 145%, and OSB (VA) 57% that was suggestive
of emphysema. The patient also has a history of chest nodules in
right upper and left lower lobes seen in [**11-17**].

CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2124-8-10**]): FECES
NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.

[**2124-8-7**] CXR IMPRESSION: There is an ill-defined opacity seen at
the left lower lung zone. Heart size and pulmonary vasculature
are normal. No pneumothorax or pleural effusions. PEG tube is
noted.

[**2124-8-8**] CXR IMPRESSION: Worsening left retrocardiac opacity and
new right basilar opacity. These findings may be due to
aspiration or developing aspiration pneumonia.

ECG Study Date of [**2124-8-7**]  3:49:44 PM Sinus rhythm. Peaked P
waves with rightward P wave axis suggest right atrial
enlargement. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2124-5-23**] no
diagnostic interim change.



Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 55 year old female with a history of reactive
airway disease and asthma that has required multiple past
hospitalizations/intubations who was  now  admitted for asthma
exacerbation in the setting of new pneumonia that was resolving
upon transfer from the ICU to the medicine floor.

She had community acquired pneumonia/bronchitis possibly exposed
since her husband had a recent upper respiratory infection. Her
chest xray at transfer showed a left lower lobe infiltrate. She
was afebrile during her stay on the medicine floor with  a
mildly elevated white cell count. She received a ten day course
of levoquin.  The pneumonia triggered an asthma exacerbation for
which she received a steroid taper and frequent
albuterol/ipatropium nebulizer respiratory therapy. At discharge
she was breathing comfortably at her baseline respiratory status
and planned to continue home nebulizer therapy, a steroid taper,
and to finish the course of levoquin.

She has a demyelinating syndrome of unknown etiology and was
continued on her regular regiment of baclofen and klonopin. She
had two episodes of muscle stiffness that was relieved by
ativan.

The patient was continued on her home IV steroid supplementation
for adrenal insufficiency, continue levothyroxine for
hypothyroidism, and her statin for hypercholesterolemia.

At discharge, the patient was comfortably eating a regular diet
and speaking easily without oxygen supplementation. She was
afebrile with baseline labs and has follow up arranged as an
outpatient and will continue respiratory therapy at home.
