History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 63 yo female with history of severe COPD and asthma
on chronic prednisone therapy and home O2 with a poor basline
exercise tolerance with DOE walking across the room.  She has
been hospitalized several times in the past ten years but has
had no prior intubations.  On [**2122-1-5**] she complained of
increasing shortness of breath and went to see her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] her
PCP's office her sat's were in the 80's and she was in moderate
respiratory distress.  She improved slightly with nebs and
refused hospitalization at that time. She went home and was
started on 40 mg Prednisone.  She did not have a significant
improvement over the next week. On [**2122-1-12**] she became acutetly
SOB while walking to the car to go to her follow up appointment
with her PCP and instead went to the local ED in [**Location (un) 45887**] VT.
At the ED her ABG was 7.24/ CO2 79/ O2 91.  She was admitted and
initially maintained on NC then bipap (which she did not
tolerate).  At 1 am on [**1-14**] her blood gas was 7.11/ 113/ 85 and
she was inubated. She was placed on SIMV at 10x500 16PSV FIO2
)0.4. Her blood gas on these sttings was 7.29/64/74.  She was
started on solumedrol 125mg q6 and IV aminophylline 20 mg/hr.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for managment of high peak
airway pressures up to the high 40's.

Echocardiogram ([**2122-2-5**])- Limited/poor study secondary to patient
being tachycardic.  LV systolic function appears depressed with
probable
mid to distal anteroseptal hypokinesis and possible apical
hypokinesis but views are technically suboptimal for assessment
of regional wall motion.
Estimated ejection fraction ?45-50%.


Brief Hospital Course:
When the patient arrived on [**1-15**] she was awake and anxious, and
with respiratory disynchrony on SIMV mode.  She was started on
Versed 4mg/hr and Fentanyl 100mcg/hr with good effect on
comfortable on the ventilator.  We discontinued the Theophylline
and continued the Levoquin and Ceftriaxone that were initiated
at the OSH.

On [**1-16**] her chest exam deteriorated with very poor air movement
and wheezes. She also had very high "auto"-PEEP, as high as 25.
She was restarted on IV aminophylline and her sedation was
increased and paralysis was considered. With increased sedation
her "autt"-PEEP decreased as well as her PIPs. Auto-PEEP was an
issue daily and she required periodic removal from the
ventilator to exsuflate the auto-PEEP.

On [**1-21**] the patient became tachycardic to the 130's and
hypertensive to the 150's SBP in the setting of decreasing
sedation and vent disynchrony.  She started on propofol and her
HR and BP normalized. An EKG taken at the time showed ST
depressions in leads v4-6 and t wave changes in II and III.
Cardiac enzymes were negative.  Auto-PEEP continued to be an
issue in times of sedation weaning so the patient was kept fully
sedated on propofol while versed and fentanyl were slowly
weaned.  In light of the fact that the main obstacle to
extubation was aggitation during weaning of sedation a
tracheostomy was thought to be of benefit because it would be
less uncomfortable. She was evaluated by IP but her anatomy was
too difficult for a percutaneous trach.  Thoracic surgery was
consulted, however on the day of her procedure her PTT became
elevated into the 60's in isolation of any other coagulation
abnormality.  She was given FFP and her PTT trended down
appropriately. It was therefore decided that the SC Heparin was
responsible for the elevated PTT.  She received a Trach and PEG
on [**1-26**].

Weaning attempts were again initiated however the patient had
several episodes of hypertension to the 170's and tachycardia to
the 120's.  She was treated with IV lopressor PRN that
transiently normalized her HR and BP. Her EKGs showed no
evidence of ischemia.   On [**1-28**] she was started on an esmolol
drip for HR control.  Hypotension then became an issue and the
esmolol was discontinued. Her blood pressure continued to
fluctuate and she recieved several NS boluses during hypotensive
episodes and lopressor PRN for tachy/hypertension.

She became more awake and interactive for the first time on [**1-30**]
and was following commands appropriately. Patient continued to
improve but had limited range of motion.  An EMG was done which
was consistent with diffuse myopathy suggestive of ICU myopathy.
 Neurology was consulted who recommended tapering steroids and
occupational and physical therapy.  Steroids were tapered down
to standing dose of prednisone 5mg qd.

Patient spiked a temperature on [**2-2**] while on vancomycin.
Vancomycin was switched to linezolid and patient breifly started
on levofloxacin and aztreonam for empiric treatment of
ventilator associated pnuemonia.  Patient wound swab from trach
site came back positive for VRE and MRSA.  Levofloxacin and
aztreonam were discontinued after blood cultures showed no
growth and sputum clture came back positive for only MRSA.
Patient to complete 14 day course of linezolid (Day#1 was [**2-2**]).

An EKG was done on [**2122-2-4**] for concern for prolonged QT interval.
 Patient's QT interval was normal however patient now had
diffuse TWI in precordial leads which were not seen on EKG on
admission.  Patient had an echocardiogram done which was a
limited study but showed a LVEF of 40-50% and septal and apical
hypokinesis.  However cardiac enzymes were flat.  Patient was
started on beta-blocker which was titrated up as patient blood
pressure tolerated.  Once patient more stable will need further
evaluation of heart function outpatient.  Patient with elevated
blood sugars during admission, which was felt to be secondary to
steroids.  Patient initially on insulin drip and then swtiched
to NPH and insulin sliding scale.  She continued to do well on
the vent and was slowly weaned down on the vent on pressure
support.
