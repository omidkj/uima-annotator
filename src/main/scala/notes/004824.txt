History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 y/o Cantonese-speaking male with PMH significant
for ESRD on HD, DM II, atrial fibrillation, CAD, who presented
from hemodialysis on [**2183-11-18**] with a reported fever of 105.7. The
patient only complained of fatigue and weakness, starting
yesterday morning. At around 2pm [**2183-11-18**], he began feeling very
tired at HD and was having chills so EMS was called. Per EMS,
the patient was hypotensive during transport but upon arrival to
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, was hypertensive to the 170's systolic.
.
In the ED, initial VS were T 102.3, BP 174/60, HR 102, RR 16,
SaO2 88%/RA. Due to the temperature, sepsis protocol was
initiated. R IJ was placed because he has poor access. CXR and
head CT were unremarkable. UA showed many bacteria but was
otherwise unremarkable. The patient reported symptoms of a
headache and neck stiffness during his ED course, however LP was
negative. Prior to the LP, he received Vancomycin 1 gm, CTX 2 gm
IV, Ampicillin 2gm IV. He also received 10 mg Dexamethasone and
a random cortisol level was sent which was normal (=8). His SBP
trended down from the 160's to 90's-100's while in the ED and he
received a total of 3 L IVF. His O2 requirement increased from 2
L NC -> 4 L NC and his SvO2 ranged from 91-97. His CVP was
documented from [**6-24**] (after approximately 2 L NS). He also
received 325 mg ASA and 2 mg IV morphine for his headache. He
was admitted to the MICU for further management. Of note, the
patient has had prior admissions for fever (101-102) in [**6-21**] and
[**7-22**] which after a thorough work-up, was attributed to gouty
flares and improved with a steroid taper. He recently saw his
rheumatologist 1 week ago, who increased his allopurinol from
200 to 300 mg daily due to acute flares through the prior dose
and increased the patient's steroid taper.
.
In the MICU, he was continued on vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
Ampicillin was discontinued given low likelihood of meningitis.
He remained hemodynamically stable and did not require fluids.
His steroid dose was increased to 32mg methylprednisolone daily,
per discussion with his outpatient rheumatologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
During the afternoon of [**2183-11-19**], he became dyspneic and wheezy
with elevated JVP and mild increase in CHF on CXR. He was felt
to be volume overloaded [**1-17**] volume resuscitation and was sent to
HD for ultrafiltraion, 2.3 L was taken off. He was transferred
to the floor in stable condition and continued on the
antibiotics. His urine cx grew out likely >100,000 Enterococcus.

.
This morning on the floor at 6:30 am, the patient triggered for
a HR in the 160's and mild respiratory distress. He received 5
mg IV metoprolol and neb treatments with improvement in his HR
to the 110's and resolution of his respiratory distress. Around
7:30 am, he was noted to be tachypneic in the 40's, extremely
wheezy, tachycardic to the 160's (a fib with RVR), and
hypertensive to the 190's systolic. He was hypoxic and placed on
a NRB, with improvement of his SaO2 to the 90's. ABG on the NRB
was 7.33/51/73. He was felt to have gone into flash pulmonary
edema and he received a total of 200 mg IV lasix with 225 cc
UOP, 1.5 mg IV morphine, 10 mg IV hydral, 5 mg IV dilt, 10 mg IV
metoprolol, and 1" nitropaste. He was initiated on BiPAP on the
floor and ABG [**4-19**] was 7.44/38/305. He received 25 mg metoprolol
po x 1 upon arrival to the MICU for persistent tachycardia in
the 140's.
