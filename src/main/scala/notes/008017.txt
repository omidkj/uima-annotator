Admission Date:  [**2144-7-3**]       Discharge Date: [**2144-7-6**]

Date of Birth:   [**2079-11-25**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Intensive Care Unit


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64 year old
female who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for
potential lytic therapy for her multiple pulmonary emboli.
The patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] on the
[**7-2**] for several days of shortness of breath and a
non productive cough. Chest x-ray showed a left upper lobe
pneumonia.

The patient was started on p.o. Levaquin and intravenous
Solu-Medrol; however, over the next 24 hours, she developed
increasing shortness of breath.  Lower extremity Dopplers
revealed a left lower leg deep vein thrombosis and CT
angiography showed multiple pulmonary emboli.

An echocardiogram was performed at [**Hospital3 **] and
despite poor cardiac windows, it was felt that she may have
had a right ventricular or right atrial thrombus.  At that
time, she was bolused with heparin and started on a heparin
drip and transferred to [**Hospital1 69**]
for potential lytic therapy for her pulmonary emboli.

Upon arrival, the patient was hemodynamically stable and was
alert.  She was on her heparin drip and she was on 100%
oxygen with a non rebreather mask.  The patient was directly
admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is
significant for obesity.  Status post cholecystectomy in [**2133**]
with complication of pancreatitis. Psoriasis.  Hypertension.
Diabetes mellitus.  Hypercholesterolemia.  Status post
hysterectomy.

ALLERGIES:
Duricef.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at the time of
admission to [**Hospital1 69**] included
the following:
Diltiazem SR 300 mg q. day.
Diaphen 160 mg q. day.
Lasix 20 mg q. day.
Glyburide 5 mg twice a day.
Lipitor 10 mg daily.

ADDITIONAL MEDICATIONS STARTED AT [**Hospital3 **]:
Levaquin 500 mg daily.
Solu-Medrol 60 mg intravenous q. eight hours.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient's social history reveals the
following:  The patient is married.  She lives with her
husband. She does not smoke, does not drink.  No intravenous
drugs.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's family history is significant
for the following:  Mother has diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination at the time of
admission to [**Hospital1 69**] revealed
the following:  Temperature 98; heart rate 87; blood pressure
122/55; respiratory rate 22; oxygen saturation 92 to 94% on
100% FI02 with a non rebreather mask.  General:  Alert and
oriented, obese female on a non rebreather, talking, in no
acute distress.  HEAD, EYES, EARS, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils
are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Moist mucous membranes.  Extraocular movements intact.
Supple neck.  No lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular
examination:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  No right ventricular heave appreciated.
Respiratory examination:  Positive crackles at the left base,
otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen obese,
positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities:  Mild legs, trace to 1+ bilateral lower
extremity edema. Faint dorsalis pedis pulses.  Neurologic:
Cranial nerves 2 through 12 grossly intact and symmetric.
Strength 5/5 bilaterally in upper and lower extremities,
distally and proximally throughout.  Sensation grossly
intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count of 12.5; hematocrit
of 40.7; platelets 211; white blood cell count differential
92% polys, 0 bands, 5 lymphocytes.  PT 18.5; PTT 150; INR of
2.3.  Sodium of 140; potassium of 5.4; chloride 104;
bicarbonate 21; BUN 45; creatinine 1.1; glucose 456.  Calcium
9.1; magnesium 2.1; phosphorus 3.1; AST 12; ALT 21; total
bilirubin of 0.3.  Troponin T less than 0.01.

Chest x-ray showed a left upper lobe infiltrate.

CAT scan from the outside hospital showed bilateral pulmonary
emboli with a right main pulmonary artery clot; left sided
pleural effusion and a left sided infiltrate.

Electrocardiogram was sinus with T wave inversions throughout
and also signs of atrial enlargement.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.) Pulmonary emboli: The patient was
admitted, already having received a heparin bolus and on a
heparin intravenous drip.  The patient was continued on her
heparin drip.  The patient remained hemodynamically stable
with blood pressures going down to the upper 80's systolic.
An arterial line was placed for better blood pressure
monitoring and the patient's blood pressures were actually
found to be slightly higher, 90's to 130's systolic.  An
echocardiogram was performed the night of admission to assess
for right atrial or right ventricular thrombus.  Again, the
cardiac windows were very poor, secondary to the patient's
body habitus, offered no obvious right atrial or right
ventricular thrombus noted.  The patient did have a slightly
dilated right ventricle but was hemodynamically stable.  At
that time, it was decided that lytic therapy would not be
appropriate, considering the great risks and the patient's
current hemodynamic stability.  She was monitored overnight
and continued on the heparin drip.  The patient continued to
remain hemodynamically stable.  She required less oxygen and
was changed over from the non rebreather mask to a face mask.
She maintained oxygen saturations in the mid to upper 90's
and remained comfortable throughout her Intensive Care Unit
stay.

2.) Deep vein thrombosis:  The patient's lower extremity non
invasive Doppler studies were repeated.  The patient was
found to have a left lower leg popliteal deep vein
thrombosis.  The patient was already on heparin therapy.  ON
the day of transfer out of the Intensive Care Unit, the
patient was to be started on Wolfram.  The patient will need
further outpatient work-up of her potential hypercoagulable
state and will need to become therapeutic on her Coumadin and
will need close follow-up with INR checks.

3.) Increased troponin.  The patient had a slightly elevated
troponin I at the outside hospital.  However, upon arrival,
the patient's troponin T at [**Hospital1 188**] was normal.  This was likely secondary to some cardiac
strain that the patient underwent at [**Hospital3 **].

4.) Pneumonia:  The patient's chest x-ray was consistent with
a left upper lobe pneumonia; however, the patient's clinical
history of non productive cough, without fever or chills was
not extremely convincing; however, the patient had been
started on Levaquin and was continued on Levaquin for a total
of a seven day course.  The patient should be followed up as
an outpatient and have a repeat chest x-ray to follow the
resolution of this radiographic finding.

5.) Diabetes mellitus:  The patient was placed on sliding
scale insulin and finger stick blood sugars were checked four
times daily.

6.) Hypertension:  The patient's Diltiazem and Diaphen and
Lasix were held during her medical Intensive Care Unit stay
as her blood pressure was in the normal range.  As an
outpatient, her blood pressure should be monitored as some of
these medications may need to be restarted.

On [**2144-7-6**], the patient was transferred out of the
Intensive Care Unit to the medical [**Hospital1 **].  The remaining
discharge summary will be dictated by the house officer
taking care of her on the [**Hospital1 **].
