History of Present Illness:
84-year-old male in the emergency department with upper GI
bleed small bowel obstruction transferred from outside
hospital. Patient has had 3 days of vomiting and decreased

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MS.
Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. No
TS. Physiologic TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.




Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2130-11-29**] he was taken urgently to the operating room due to
gastric necrosis where he underwent total gastrectomy, Roux en Y
reconstruction, Enterolysis and placement of tube jejunostomy
for feeding. He was taken to the ICU postoperatively where he
remained for some time. Because of his COPD history there were
issues with oxygenation; he was extubated during the evening of
[**11-29**]. He was treated with nebulizers, steroids and intermittent
IV Lasix.  He was weaned off pressors and started on diltiazem
for atrial fibrillation.  Tube feeds were started through the
J-tube but held when he developed abdominal distention. He
eventually was stabilized for transfer out of the ICU.

On [**2130-12-4**], he was transferred to the floor; on the following
morning after transfer he was noted with a trigger event for
rapid atrial fibrillation and tachypnea. He was given IV
Lopressor and transferred back to the ICU where he remained for
another several days. During his re-admission to the ICU he was
placed back on Diltiazem drip. During this time his NG was
removed and he underwent a esophageal study which showed
moderately dilated esophagus with narrowing of esophagojejunal
anastomosis, likely due to postoperative edema but no evidence
of leak or obstruction.

Once transferred back to the floor he continued to progress; his
rate was controlled on oral Diltiazem and his oxygenation
requirements had improved  so that he requires 2-3 liters with
saturations in mid 90's range. He was seen by Pulmonology during
his ICU stay who felt that his early hypoxemia was likely a
result of a combination of post-op atelectasis, aspiration,
volume overload (15L for LOS), and COPD though unclear to what
extent his underlying lung disease may be playing a role as we
do not know his baseline.

A swallow evaluation was ordered but deferred given the results
of the esophagus study. Currently he is allowed to have sips
with his oral meds with his entire nutrition being provided via
enteral feedings.

He was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy and is
being recommended for rehab after his acute hospital stay.
