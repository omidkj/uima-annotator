Chief Complaint:
RUQ pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation; Cholecystostomy x 2; paracentesis x 3

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 16495**] is a 70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI,
CAD, prostate cancer, and DM who presented to [**Hospital3 17031**]
today with increasing RUQ abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and
change in mental status. At the OSH his family gave a history of
questionable bloody emesis so he underwent an NG lavage which
was negative. He was felt to be dry on exam and given 2 L of
IVF. He was started on a PPI and given levofloxacin, zosyn, and
morphine for pain. LFTS WNL except for a Tbili of 2.9 which was
within his baseline. A CT abd/pelvis showed ascites and a
dilated gallbladder with a thickened wall which was changed from
previous studies.
.
In the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], vs were: afebrile P 99 BP 111/61 RR 23 O2
sat 94% on 2L. Patient was given 1.8 L NS. Surgery was consulted
and recommended an abdominal ultrasound which preliminarily
showed gallbladder wall thickening with nonmobile sludge at the
neck. The read stated that the thickening could be related to
liver disease, but was concerning for acute cholecystitis.
Surgery did not feel he was a surgical candidiate. HIDA scan was
recommended for further workup and a cholecystostomy tube could
be placed if he is confirmed to have cholecystitis. In the ED he
also had a diagnostic paracentesis which showed 24k WBC and 21k
RBC with 88% polys.
.
Of note the family has been discussing hospice. His daughter is
his health care proxy.
.
He was hospitalized last week for unclear reasons and is
frequently hospitalized. Had a recent UTI and is still taking
nitrofurantoin for another 4 days. Last bowel movement was
yesterday afternoon. Has been having urinary retension for the
last few days. His abdominal pain started on Sunday suddenly. He
states the pain is crampy and throughout his abdomen. It is [**7-21**]
and doesn't radiate. Is constant. Had associated nausea and
vomiting x 5. Denies vomiting of blood.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 70 yo male with pmh of dCHF, cirrhosis, CRI, CAD,
prostate cancer, and DM who presented to an OSH ED today with
increasing RUQ abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and change in
mental status concerning for acute cholecystitis.
.
# Sepsis secondary to cholecystitis: The patient presented with
RUQ pain and imaging which was  consistent with cholecystitis.
Per surgery he was not a surgical candidiate. A HIDA scan was
performed which was consistent with cholecystitis. IR placed a
cholecystostomy tube to allow drainage of his infected
gallbladder. He was placed on vanc and zosyn initially.
Intially, culture data grew GNR's; he intially started on cipro
and zosyn. Initally, the cultures grew E. coli and cipro and
vanc were d/c'd. He was continued on zosyn. As more culture data
came back, he also grew E. coli that was intermediately
sensitive to zosyn. He was switched to meropenem after this.
Unfortunately, the patient continued to spike temps and his
hepatic enzymes continued to rise. Through the course of his
dressing changes around his cholecystostomy tube, his tube fell
out. IR replaced the tube and adequate billous drainage appeared
again. Even after this intervention, the patient continued to
have increased hepatic enzymes and worsening sepsis.  Patient
was also found to have an anion gap acidosis, likely related to
elevated lactate in the setting of hypotension and sepsis.

On [**9-14**], the patient was intubated due to significantly
increased work of breathing. It was felt intubation would
improve patient's respiratory status it would help relieve the
tremendous pressures on his chest and abdomen from his
significant ascites. He abdomen was tapped three times during
his course to help improve his respiratory status but little
effect. He was unable to be weaned off of the vent, due to high
pleural pressures in the setting of the high abdominal pressures
pressing on the chest wall.

After a prolonged course in the ICU that ended in multisystem
organ failure, during a family meeting on [**9-23**], he was made DNR
by his family.  Shortly there after he was found to be in DIC,
and on [**9-24**], the patient was made CMO due to the unlikelihood
of recovering from the multi-organ failure and DIC.  He was made
comfortable, extubated and expired with his family present.

# Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Initially thought to be
due to ATN, also with a component of abdominal compartment
syndrome, due the extremely large volume of ascites and high
bladder pressures.  His creatinine would transiently improve
post paracentesis, but as the fluid would rapidly reaccumu
