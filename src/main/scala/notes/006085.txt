Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status, tachypnea, anemia

RIJ Central Line Placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 75404**] is an 88 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, MVR, CHF, COPD,
afib, with recent admission for chronic L pleural
effusion/hemothorax, s/p VATS with decortication complicated by
HAP, who presents from rehab with altered mental status.
.
He was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 110979**] for evaluation and
management of L pleural effusion/hemothorax. He underwent
partial decortication and parietal pleurectomy on [**4-16**]. His
course was complicated by repeat mucous plugging requiring
bronchosocopy. He was also treated for CAP with levofloxacin and
HAP with vanco/zosyn through [**4-30**]. Furthermore, he failed
multiple swallow evaluations, undergoing a G tube for tube
feeds. Hematology evaluated the patient for persistent
thrombocytopenia, which was felt to be due to MDS. His INR was
also persistently high, despite having his coumadin held for his
procedures. After a prolonged hospitalization, he was discharged
to rehab.
.
At rehab, his mental status had been below baseline but was
slowly improving. However, Over the last 24 hr his mental status
became worse, with more somnolence. At baseline he is awake and
conversant according to his son. The staff also noted an
increasing fluid collection in his LLE. Blood work was sent
which showed a Hct of 22 and new leukocytosis. ALso there was a
question of bloody stool. He was therefore sent to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
evaluation.
.
In the ED, T96, BP 97/41, HR 68, RR 16, 96% 2L. LLE fluid
collection aspirated. Given 1g vanco, zosyn for ? infection.
Appeared to calm slightly during the course of the ED stay. CXR,
CT head, LLE LENIs performed. He was noted to be tachypneic but
with stable 02 sats.
.
On arrival to the floor, he is moaning and tachypneic. He is
able to nod yes-no to simple questions, but is non-conversant.
.
ROS: As per above, otherwise unable to obtain

Social History:
Lived with his wife on [**Location (un) **] prior to last hospitalization
but admitted from rehab. Has hired live-in help. They also have
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] in [**Location (un) 86**]. He is a semi-retired owner of a manufacturing
plant in aerospace materials and offshore oil. He is a former

alcoholic beverages (mostly mixed drinks) per day. Denies
illicit drug use.

.
[**2117-5-4**] Portable CXR - Continued left mid and lower lung
opacification, unchanged. Resolving right lower lobe opacities.
No new consolidations seen.
.
[**2117-5-4**] CT Head - No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage
or large masses.
.
[**2117-5-4**] Left LENI -
1. No DVT seen though evaluation incompletee due to patient
discomfort.
2. Large heterogeneous mass in the popliteal/ calf region, most
compatible
with large hematoma.
.
[**2117-5-5**] Echo
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with lateral
hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. At least
moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**5-6**] CT Torso w/o contrast:
CHEST: There is consolidation within the right lower lobe. There
is
consolidation/collapse of the left lower lobe, with a small
amount of pleural
effusion on the left. There is no axillary, mediastinal, or
hilar
lymphadenopathy by size criteria. Coronary calcifications are
noted. Post-CABG
changes are noted.

ABDOMEN: A nasogastric tube is in place. The evaluation of the
solid organs
is limited by non-contrast technique. Allowing for this
limitation, there is
no gross contour abnormality associated with the liver, spleen,
pancreas, or
adrenals. The kidneys are atrophic bilaterally, and contain
punctate non-
obstructing calculi. There are bilateral exophytic renal lesions
which cannot
be characterized as simple cysts. There is no hydronephrosis.
Abdominal
aortic aneurysm is again identified, unchanged, measuring
approximately 3.9 cm
in maximal diameter. There is no retroperitoneal hematoma. There
is no
abdominal lymphadenopathy.

PELVIS: Evaluation of the pelvis is limited due to extensive
streak artifact
from patient's bilateral hip arthroplasties. Allowing for this
limitation,
there is no gross fluid collection or abnormality within the
pelvis.

LOWER EXTREMITIES: There is a large hematoma within the left
calf, starting
at the level of the popliteal fossa, extending for approximately
20 cm
craniocaudad. There is extensive soft tissue edema and
thickening of the
facial planes superior to the hematoma.

Extensive arterial calcifications are noted in the lower
extremities
bilaterally.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is diffuse osteopenia. There is
extensive
degenerative change. Bilateral hip arthroplasties are noted.
There are no
destructive osseous lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large left calf hematoma. No retroperitoneal bleed.
2. Bilateral lower lobe consolidation/atelectasis as described
above.
.
[**5-9**] CT Chest
FINDINGS:

Compared to the recent study, there is interval increase in the
secretions
within the trachea as well as within the left main bronchus, and
left upper
and left lower lobe bronchi with subsequent development of an
atelectasis
which involves almost entire left lower lobe with and a
significant part of
left upper lobe with sparing of the apex. These findings may
contribute to
the fluid-like appearance of the chest radiograph but actually
no interval
worsening of pleural effusion has been demonstrated. The right
pleural
effusion has increased in the interim but still small. At the
right base,
there is interval development of consolidation that is
disproportional to the
amount of pleural fluid and might represent an area of
infection/aspiration.
The rest of the right lower lobe and the right upper lobe is
grossly
unremarkable but note is made that the quality of the study is
not optimal due
to the presence of motion artifact. In the superior portion of
the left upper
lobe, there are areas of consolidation as well as pleural
thickening that have
progressed since
