Discussed findings with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who is caring for the

Pathology:
Right main bronchus tumor, endobronchial biopsy:   Squamous cell
carcinoma.
Note:
The biopsy specimen shows invasive moderately-differentiated
keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma.

Brief Hospital Course:
56 yo male with PMH CLL/SLL found to have enlarging right upper
lobe mass who is transferred for possible tumor debridement.
.
MICU course: IP bronched patient and noted large amount of
probable diffuse lung cancer. Stent was not placed due to tumor
extension almost to RLL and no tumor-free area to stent.
Heme/Onc will plan for tissue targeted chemo-regimen.
Outpatient oncologist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11636**] at [**Hospital3 **].
Pathology from OSH showed squamous cell carcinoma.  He was
extubated on the second day.  He underwent MRI of brain which
showed a left frontal lobe lesion.  Other imaging finding noted
for femur and spine and diffused [**Hospital3 500**] mets.  Also was noted
there was a positive rare yeast in tissue culture from [**1-27**].
He was weaned down O2 and is in process to eval by Onc to get
radiation and chemo.
.
He had pain due to the [**Month/Year (2) 500**] mets which was initially not
controlled by a combination of IV morphine.  This was converted
to oxycodon for breakthrough, standing Oxycontin and Lidoderm
for maintenance.  With this new regimen he had better control.
The pain manangement is a large part of his palliative care.  He
is aware of this diagnosis and will discuss the further plan of
care with his outpatient oncologist.  He elected to follow up
with his prior oncologist and PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 20282**] were [**Name (NI) 653**] by the
inpatient team and are aware of the plans for follow up.
