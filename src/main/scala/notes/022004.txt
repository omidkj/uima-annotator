Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
leg swelling

History of Present Illness:
47 year old female PMH breast cancer who presents with bilateral
lower extremity edema of 1 day duration. One month ago patient
began wheezing and coughing which was treated with 3 weeks of
prednisone and nebs for presumed asthma by her pcp, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] symptoms
did not improve with treatment. Patient also describes
progressive shortness of breath with exertion (currently can
only walk 6 feet) and significant orthopnea (sleeps in a chair
sitting up) of 1 month duration. 1 week ago patient began
experiencing pleuritic chest pain. She denies PND or syncope.
Patient reports chills, mild sore throat and ear infection which
was treated with 5 days of antibiotics (unknown) by her pcp one
month ago. Patient denies fever. Patient additionally reports 1
month history of decreased po intake, weight loss and
intermittent vomiting.
.
Patient has had poor follow-up with her medical care. She has
not seen an Oncologist in over a year (no shows to
appointments). She recently went to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6924**] of [**Hospital3 4262**] in
an attempt to re-unite with medical care.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.4, HR 115, BP 117/95, RR 16.
O2 98%. EKG demonstrated electrical alternans and consequently a
bedside ECHO was done which demonstrated large effusion with
suggestion of tamponade. Patient was admitted to the CCU for
further monitoring.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative otherwise than noted in
HPI.

pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. No xanthalesma.

NECK: JVP elevated to mandible.
CARDIAC: Distant heart sounds. No murmers or rubs, but difficult
to examine due to frequent coughing. No thrills, lifts.
LUNGS: Wheezes b/l, again difficult to examine due to frequent
coughing.

enlarged by palpation. No abdominial bruits.

Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+
Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+

Pertinent Results:
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2116-9-12**]: Difficult study due to patient
frequent coughing. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size,
and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. There is abnormal diastolic
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is a large pericardial effusion. The
effusion appears circumferential. There is right ventricular
diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade
physiology.
.
CXR [**2116-9-12**]:
1. Bilateral effusions.
2. Atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right middle lobe.
3. Cephalization of the pulmonary vessels consistent with mild
congestive failure.

.
Pericardial fluid biopsy 10/10/9:
Positive for malignant cells.
Consistent with breast carcinoma.
.
10/10/9 Echo:
IMPRESSIOn: Large circumfirential pericardial effusion without
overt echocardiographic tamponade.
.
10/10/9 Cath:
COMMENTS:
1. Resting hemodynamics revealed hemodynamic evidence of
pericardial tamponade, with equalization of the end-diastolic
pressure
contours.
2. Pericardial pressure recordings demonstrated equalization of
right
atrial and pericardial pressures.
3. After removal of 500 mL of dark sanguinous fluid, pericardial

pressures decreased to < 5 mmHg, although right heart pressures
remained
elevated with PCWP of 18mmHg, RVEDP of 14mmHg, and RA pressure
of
16mmHg, with a prominant 'Y' descent and square root sign,
consistent
with residual effusive-constrictive picture.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Pericardial effusive constrictive disease.
.
10/10/9 Echo:
Post-cardiocentesis echocardiogram performed in the cath lab.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is a
residual pericardial effusion. There is no echocardiographic
evidence of tamponade.
Compared with prior from today, effusion size has significantly
decreased.
.
10/10/9 CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral effusions.
2. Atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right middle lobe.
3. Cephalization of the pulmonary vessels consistent with mild
congestive
failure.
.
10/11/9 echo:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-9-12**]
(post pericardiocentesis), no change.
.
10/10/9 EKG:
Sinus tachycardia. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2116-7-20**]
the rate has increased.
10/11/9 EKG:
Sinus rhythm. Non-specific diffuse ST-T wave changes are
suggestive
of pericarditis. Compared to previous tracing ST-T wave changes
are new.
.
[**9-16**] Pleural fluid analysis:
POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Consistent with adenocarcinoma.
.
[**9-16**] CT torso:
1. Large nonhemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusion with adjacent
compressive
atelectasis. No pulmonary lesion, however evaluation limited by
atelectasis.
2. Pericardial drain in place.
3. Multiple new scatter
