Pertinent Results:
[**2134-4-16**] MRI Lspine:
1. Findings indicative of bony metastatic disease with
predominant involvement of the sacrum.
2. Sacral involvement is in the midline and on the left side
with involvement of the left S2 and S3 foramina which could
result in irritation of left S2 and S3 nerve roots.
3. Severe left foraminal stenosis at L4-5 level due to disc
protrusion which could result in irritation of left L4 nerve
root.
4. Multilevel degenerative changes with mild-to-moderate spinal
stenosis at L2-3 and mild spinal stenosis at L3-4 and L4-5
levels.
5. Retroperitoneal and pelvic lymphadenopathy.
.
[**2134-4-16**] Hip Xray: Unchanged appearance of subtle lucent lesion
in left proximal femoral diaphysis consistent with metastasis.
No evidence of pathologic fracture. No other foci suspicious for
metastasis identified in the pelvis or imaged portion of left
femur and knee.
.
[**2134-4-16**] Head CT: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or
fracture
.
[**2134-4-16**] Chest Xray: No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
.
[**2134-4-17**] MRI HEAD:  Moderate changes of small vessel disease. No
enhancing brain lesions are identified. No acute infarct is
noted. Chronic lacune left thalamus.
.
[**2134-4-19**] Right foot xray:  No fracture or osteolysis involving
the second digit.
.
[**2134-4-20**] Echocardiogram: The left atrium is elongated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild to
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-20**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2133-8-24**], LVH is now present. The overall LVEF is
probably similar. The degree of mitral regurgitation is slightly
less.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 108116**] is an 81 y/o M with h/o CAD, CHF (EF 35%), HTN,
CRI, metastatic prostate cancer who was recently initiated on
chemotherapy Taxotere/pamindronate [**2134-4-8**] who presents with 2
syncopal episodes and bright blood per rectum.
.
1)BRBPR- He was initially admitted to the ICU due to concern for
brisk GI bleed given syncope.  His HCT on admission was 31 and
he was transfused 1 unit PRBC.  He was evaluated by GI service
who felt that bleeding was most likely due to irritation and
proctitis in the setting of recent chemotherapy in combination
with ASA/PLAVIX/NSAID use making him more susceptible to
bleeding.  His hematocrit remained stable throughout the
remainder of his admission and he did not require any furhter
transfusions.  He did not have colonoscopy or endoscopy during
admission given that he had a troponin leak vs old NSTEMI and
was felt to be at high risk for the procedure and his HCT was
stable with no significant bleeding during his admission.  He
was advised to avoid NSAIDS, but continue aspirin and plavix
given his cardiac risk.

2)Syncope: most likely related to orthostasis/hypovolemia in the
setting of recent chemotherapy and poor oral intake.  Cardiac
arrhythmia/infarction also possible but less likel
