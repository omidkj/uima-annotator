Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1974**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall, lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
71 yo Farsi speaking female with history of CAD s/p CABG x 4,
COPD on home bipap + oxygen, DM2, CHF, VT s/p AICD [**1-2**],
schizophrenia, multiple falls in the past (most recent in [**4-5**]),
presents after an unwitnessed fall on [**6-25**] AM on way to
bathroom. Her had initially noticed that she seemed more sleepy
than normal. When the daughter returned to check on her that
evening, she found her mother down in the bathroom. She has been
more sleepy since yesterday afternoon. The patient (with
assistance from the daughter for translation) says that she felt
dizzy before she fell. She hit her head on the door at the time
of the fall, she denies other trauma. She did complain of LLQ
abdominal pain which has resolved. She was unconscious briefly
but awoke on the bathroom floor. She was incontinent of bowel
and bladder on her way to the bathroom. Denies chest pain,
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, fever, or chills,
dysuria, diarrhea, or changes in her bowel movements. No recent
changes in meds or diet. No sick contacts. She uses the bipap
regularly although the daughter states that sometimes the
medications she is taking make her sleepy so she misses it.
.
Vitals in the ED were temp 99.1, HR 95, BP 125/43, sats
initially 70s% on RA-> 98% on NRB. In the ED she was noted to be
somnolent and in moderate respiratory distress distress. An ABG
in the ED was 7.30/75/199, her baseline CO2 is usually in the
60s. Lab notable for Na 152, nl BUN/creat 0.8, stable hct 32.
U/A was negative, bld cx sent and remained negative. She was
complaining of LLQ abdominal tenderness so an abdominal CT was
performed which was unremarkable. She also had some right wrist
tenderness, an x-ray showed no fracture. She was treated with
BIPAP in the ED and transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
Of note she was admitted [**Date range (3) 65254**] for a similar episode.
On that admission she had fallen on her way to the bathroom
after removing her BIPAP and Oxygen. On that admission she was
felt to have worsening of her COPD due to CHF and a URI.

CT ABD/PELVIS:
1. No evidence of acute traumatic injury.

2. Unchanged nonspecific liver and renal lesions and right
infrahilar lymphadenopathy.
.
.
CXR:
Single AP radiograph of the chest performed on [**2130-6-25**] at 19:30
hours is compared with the prior radiograph of [**2129-4-19**]. No
significant adverse interval change is noted. There is
cardiomegaly. There is a transvenous pacemaker unchanged in
position. There is minimal subsegmental atelectasis at the left
base. There is no evidence of acute consolidation or frank
failure on the current examination.
.
.
TTE:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis
(area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior
space which
most likely represents a fat pad.


Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-1-10**],
overall left
ventricular systolic function now appears improved. Previously
described
anteroseptal and apical wall motion abnormalities are probably
still present,
but current study is technically suboptimal for full evaluation
of regional
wall motion. The severity of aortic stenosis has increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Hypercarbic respiratory failure:
Pt was admitted with elevated CO2 and her hypercarbia was likely
the cause of her lethargy and fall.  The etiology of her
hypercarbic respiratory failure was likely due oversedation from
multiple psychiatric medications on top of overlying COPD and
lack of use of BiPAP.  She was restarted on Bipap and her
medication regimen was cut down.  Her topamax and restoril were
stopped and depakote dose was reduced.  She was continued on
abilify, risperdal, and zoloft.  Her resp status was improved
with this.  She was continued on frequent nebulizers.  There was
no evidence of pneumonia or other acute pulmonary process.  She
should continue on BiPAP at nite and for about 2 hours in the
afternoon or any time she naps.
.
2) UTI:
Pt had a Foley catheter in since admission and on day of
discharge she c/o dysuria and urine appeared cloudy.  She was
started on cefpodoxime empirically for UTI pending U/A and
culture.  Should get 2 week course for complicated UTI.
Catheter removed.  After discharge, urine culture grew < 100K
enterococcus [**Last Name (un) 36**] to ampicillin.
.
3) Schizophrenia:
Medications adjusted as above.
.
4) HA:
Pt c/o HA throughout admission.  She had 2 head CT's given fall
(one on admission and one on discharge) without evidence of ICH.
 She states she gets HA at home too and this felt similar.
Respond to tylenol.
.
5) CAD/CHF:
No active issues.  Continued on ASA, beta blocker, atorvastatin,
digoxin, lasix.  Appeared euvolemic throughout.
.
6) DM2:
Initially, on SSI, then restarted home dose of glyburide.
