Service:

This will cover [**Hospital 228**] hospital course after the SICU stay
from [**2187-1-2**] to [**2187-1-9**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient was initially admitted
with a chief complaint of dyspnea and CHF exacerbation.  She
is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old white female with history of severe AR, CHF,
who was admitted to the VICU for dyspnea, and is now being
called out to the floor.  She was initially admitted on [**12-31**]
after initially presenting to an outside hospital having
chest pain and shortness of breath.  She was intubated after
an ABG at the outside hospital was 7.23, 57, and 227.  She
was given Lasix, Morphine, nitrates, and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**].  She had a troponin of 0.12.  Her hematocrit also was
low at 26.2.  She was started on Lasix, hydralazine,
nitrates, and aspirin.  She was extubated on [**2187-1-1**], and an
echocardiogram was done as well as metoprolol was started.

Currently, she denies any chest pain, shortness of breath,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.  Denies cough, fevers, or
chills.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Recent pneumonia on admission from [**Date range (1) 8287**].
2. Coronary artery disease status post MI in [**10-30**] as well as
in [**10-31**].
3. CHF with an EF of 15-20% on an echocardiogram obtained
[**2187-1-1**].  This also showed severe [**3-1**]+ AR.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency.
5. History of MRSA UTI in [**10-31**].
6. Gout.
7. Chronic pericardial effusion.  Patient has refused
pericardiocentesis numerous times, although there was no
evidence of tamponade on the recent echocardiogram.
8. Left bundle branch block.
9. Total abdominal hysterectomy.
10. Thoracic aortic aneurysm.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is married for 72 years.  No smoking or
ethanol use.  She has a history of medical noncompliance.

ALLERGIES:
1. Penicillin.
2. Questionable of a beta blocker allergy.
3. Questionable history of ACE inhibitor allergy.

PERTINENT FINDINGS ON EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure was
131/46.  She was satting 98% on 4 liters.  She was in for 950
and out for 1389.  Length of stay she was 2 liters negative.
She had dry mucous membranes.  Her JVP was at 10 cm.  She has
bibasilar crackles without wheezing.  She had a grade 3/6
systolic ejection murmur heard best at the right upper
sternal border as well as a grade [**2-2**] blowing diastolic
murmur heard best at the mid left sternal border.  She had no
peripheral edema.  A peak troponin was 0.21 with a CK of 43
and a MB of 4.

On [**2187-1-1**], she had a chest x-ray which showed a dense
focal opacification behind the left side of the heart, either
atelectasis or infiltrate.  The left costophrenic angle was
blunted, mild-to-moderate CHF.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. CHF:  As noted previously, the patient has a severely
depressed ejection fraction along with 3-4+ AR.  She was
initially continued on her beta blocker, hydralazine, and
Isordil.  She was also kept on 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. of Lasix.
Per the attending's recommendations, it was decided to start
the patient on Natrecor for diuresis.  She received two days
of Natrecor diuresis and then was continued on 40 mg p.o.
b.i.d. of Lasix.

Also a CHF consult was obtained, and they recommended
starting the patient on Toprol XL 12.5 mg q.d.  She is also
started on captopril 6.25 mg b.i.d, which she tolerated.
Also on the day of discharge, the patient was discharged on
lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.

2. In terms of ischemia, the patient was continued on aspirin
and also the patient was started on Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
The treatment team discussed the patient's therapeutic
options for coronary disease, and the patient repeatedly
refused invasive interventions such as cardiac
catheterization.

3. In terms of her rhythm, she continued in left bundle
branch block with no evidence of other dysrhythmia.  A lipid
panel was checked, and the patient was noted to have an
appropriate LDL goal.

On the evening of [**2187-1-7**], the patient had two episodes of
chest pain, one at approximately 10:30 p.m. and one at
approximately 12 a.m. associated with some anterolateral
T-wave changes.  The patient was given sublingual
nitroglycerin during each of these episodes with relief.  The
patient had a peak troponin during this episode of chest pain
at 0.11.

Per extensive discussion with the attending, it was agreed
not to start a Heparin drip on this patient as A. The patient
has a history of hematuria and GI bleed while on Heparin, and
B. Heparin is usually a bridge of treatment to definitive
interventions such as cardiac catheterization or bypass, and
therefore was agreed that the patient would not be started on
a Heparin drip.

4. Patient was noted to have cloudy urine, and a urinalysis
was sent which did reveal a urinary tract infection.  She was
started on levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q.48h. (renally dosed for
a total of 10 day course).

5. Chronic renal insufficiency:  The patient's creatinine
remained at her baseline during her admission.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Congestive heart failure.
2. Coronary artery disease.
3. Severe aortic regurgitation.
4. Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction x2.
5. Respiratory failure.
6. Chronic renal insufficiency.
7. Left bundle branch block.
8. Chronic pericardial effusion without evidence of
tamponade.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient was instructed to call her
primary care doctor or 911 if she began having chest pain,
shortness of breath, severe difficulty laying down flat, leg
swelling, fevers, chills, or any other complaints.  Patient
was also told to begin a Lasix sliding scale as directed.
This will be accomplished through home VNA, who will help
with her this.  She was also told to followup with her
cardiologist within two weeks, and she will be receiving home
VNA through her niece.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Protonix 40 q.d.
2. Aspirin 325 q.d.
3. Metoprolol XL 12.5 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Sublingual nitrate prn.
7. Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. q.d.
8. Levofloxacin 250 mg one tablet p.o. q.48h. to finish
[**2187-1-16**].
9. She is also to receive potassium chloride prn through her
VNA.  The patient should have Chem-7s drawn approximately
twice a week to follow her kidney function and her potassium
levels as she is on both an ACE inhibitor and Lasix.
