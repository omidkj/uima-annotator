Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, abdominal discomfort

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
66 yo M with h/o CAD s/p CABG x2 , a-fib/a-flutter on coumadin
s/p recent PVI ([**2157-6-8**]), DM, HLD, CKD, presented with SOB and
abdominal discomfort and admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service on [**2157-6-11**].
 In brief, pt started feeling abdominal bloating on his way home
from his PVI appt in the AM. He then noticed worsening SOB and
called and some angina and called the heart line on [**2157-6-11**] and
they told him to come in.  In the ED his labs were singificant
for a Troponin N of 1.8 and INR of 4.2 and cxr showed no
pulmonary edema, but a small pleural effusion.  He was given
40mg IV lasix and transferred to the floor.
On the floor, the patient recieved another 40mg IV lasix and
metoprolol tartrate 50mg po x1.  Starting around 7am this AM, he
developed asytolic pauses of [**6-18**] seconds where the patient was
symptomatic with lightheadedness and LOC.  He had transcutaneous
pacer pads placed and had witnessed episodes of asystole x
9seconds.  He was not transcutaneous paced as he regained rhythm
back.  Pt reports that these episodes feel very scary and he is
concerned about them.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,syncope or
presyncope.

IMAGING:
[**2157-6-11**] TTE:
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size. Mild
regional LV systolic dysfunction. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen. Dilated RV cavity. Mild
global RV free wall hypokinesis. Abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with RV pressure/volume overload.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate [[**1-10**]+] TR. Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Significant PR. The
end-diastolic PR velocity is increased c/w PA diastolic
hypertension.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal
views. Emergency study performed by the cardiology fellow on
call.

Conclusions
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with probable hypokinesis of the basal inferior
segment. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with probable mild hypokinesis of
the basal inferior segment. The other segments have normal
function. Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle with evidence
of pressure/volume overload and likely pulmonary hypertension
(could not estimate PA systolic pressure but PA diastolic
pressure likely high). No significant pericardial effusion.

or edema.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions, seen
only on the lateral view.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
