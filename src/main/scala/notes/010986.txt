History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 13998**] is a 85 year old woman has a history of coronary
artery disease s/p drug-eluting stents in ostium as well as
proximal and mid segments of the RCA in [**6-/2173**], CHF ([**5-/2171**] EF
20%) who presented to the CCU for continued management of
stuttering chest pain and respiratory distress.
.
The patient presented to the cardiology clinic with symptoms
concerning for a decline in her functional capacity (DOE,
orthopnea) and the patient was referred to cardiac
catheterization on [**2173-6-1**].
.
Angiography revealed a 60% eccentric LAD lesion after the D1
bifurcation.  There was a small circumflex with diffuse proximal
60-70% stenosis.  There was also right coronary artery, which
was a large and dominant vessel having an 80-90% ostial lesion
and diffuse proximal mid 50% and mid 70% lesions with
left-to-right collaterals present.  Drug-eluting stents were
placed in the ostium as well as the proximal and mid segments of
the RCA with good results.
.
Post-PCI, the patient reported improvement in her symptoms so
much so she was able to discontinue use of home oxygen.
.
The patient had been in USOH when developed gradual onset
malaise 4days days prior to admission. Per report since Friday
of last week patient has felt unwell. She reports episodes of
intermittent chest pressure, which is not new for her. However,
for the last couple of days she has been concerned that her SL
NTG is 'expired' because it doesn't have the same effect as
usual. On day prior to admission she had persistent chest
pressure that lasted a couple of hours and did not respond to
her SL NTG. Patient reports associated DOE, dizziness,
?orthopnea and ?PND.
.
On review of systems, she complains of a mild dysuria and
continues to take all medications as prescribed. She does not
have fever, chills, cough, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
.
The constellation of symptoms prompted presentation to
cardiology clinic. In clinic patient found to be diaphretic,
dyspneic and tachypneic with SBPs in 80s, HR in 100s with weight
129.8lb. A decision was made to refer patient to the ED for
further evaluation.
.
In the ED, 98.2 85 100/65 18 97% 2L NC, ABG: pH 7.37 pCO2 41 pO2
63 HCO3 25. Labs notable for flat biomarkers (trop <0.01, MB:
3), proBNP: 4557, + UA. CXR with florid pulmonary edema. In ED
patient appeared very uncomfortable with O2 Sats in the 80s on
RA. She was started on BiPAP and received Lasix 10 mg IV with a
total 600cc diuresis in the ED. Patient also given [**Year (4 digits) **]
suppository and started on heparin bolus + gtt for potential
ischemic trigger in setting of known LAD lesion. She was also
given SL nitro x 2 followed by nitro gtt with complete relief of
chest pain.  UA was markedly positive, and she was given 400 mg
IV ciprofloxacin x 1.  Prior to transfer, patient remained on
Bipap at 10/5, 50% O2, reportedly looked more comfortable.  VS
prior to transfer: HR 80, BP 100/60, RR 18, 100% on facemask
.
On arrival in the CCU, VSS with O2 saturations >95% on 5-6L
facemask. Patient without complaint denying active chest pain
and reports improved SOB.
.
Current cardiac review of systems is notable improved, yet still
present SOB; resolved chest pain; lack of paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.
