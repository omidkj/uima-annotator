Chief Complaint:
jaundice, transferred to MICU for hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. right IJ placed in ED [**8-29**]
2. cholecystostomy tube placement [**8-29**] by Interventional

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 81 year old male with PMH Diabetes, unknown
other PMH as no previous medical records here, with reported

his
medical history was obtained from ED chart, GI fellow's note and
conversation with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3459**], gastroenterologist at [**Location 1268**]
VA. Per records from ACS discussion with Dr. [**Name (NI) 3459**], pt
presented to WVA about 2-3 weeks ago with painless jaundice. His
Tbili was reported to be in the low 20s and AP ~2200 His work up
including a CT pancreas protocol which showed a large pancreatic
mass at the head involving that involving the SMA, SMV and
possible portal vein. Surgery was consulted but recs were
unknown. Patient underwent EUS with biopsies which didn't yield
carcinoma. However, brush biopsy (sent out) was highly
suspicious for malignancy. Patient
underwent ERCP with covered stent placement and his LFTs
improved. Patient was either d/c home or left AMA on [**8-28**] and

91% PMN's, Tbili 9.7. Exam notable for pt mildly confused,
non-focal neuro exam otherwise. Appeared comfortable, making

STUDIES:
CXR [**2139-8-29**]:
FINDINGS: No consolidation or edema is evident. The mediastinum
is
unremarkable. Dual-chamber pacemaker is in standard course and
position from a left subclavian approach. Calcified plaque is
seen at the aortic arch. The cardiac silhouette is within normal
limits for size. No effusion or pneumothorax is noted. The
osseous structures reveal degenerative change throughout the
thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.

CT TORSO [**2139-8-29**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No discrete pancreatic mass. However, given given pancreatic
dustal
dilatation and abnormal morphology of pancreatic head, an
infiltrative process cannot be excluded. Correlate with ERCP
findings and pathology from OSH.
2. G
