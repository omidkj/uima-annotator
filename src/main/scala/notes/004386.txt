Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mitral valve replacement with a 31-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
mechanical valve


History of Present Illness:
43 year old male that presented in [**Month (only) 216**] with S. salivarius
mitral valve endocarditis with multiple septic embolic on
imaging including both kidneys, the spleen and a left parietal
hemorrhage with additional acute infarcts in the
right temporal and parietal region. He underwent a cerebral
angiogram on [**9-20**] and was found to have a mycotyic aneurysm as
cause of L parietal lesion and underwent embolization. The
patient completed 14 days of gentamicin on [**9-22**]. He will have
completed 6 weeks of ceftriaxone [**10-23**].
He presented in [**Month (only) **] with wrist pain and was treated for
arteritis and thrombus of a branch of his left radial artery.
Currently presents for valve replacement due to mitral
regurgitation with symptoms of shortness of breath with minimal
activity and chest pain that comes and goes occuring at rest and
activity resolves quickly.  He denies fever or chills.

Conclusions
PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No thrombus is seen in the
left atrial appendage. The right atrium is moderately dilated. A
patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt across
the interatrial septum is seen at rest throughout the cardiac
cycle.

There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%).

The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global
free wall hypokinesis.

No thoracic aortic dissection is seen. The descending thoracic
aorta has mild intimal thickening.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.

There is an echodense mass measuring 1 cm, likely old
vegetation, attached to the A2 portion of the mitral leaflet.
There appears to be a defect in the A2 portion of the anterior
mitral leaflet leading to non-coaptation of the anterior and
posterior leaflets. There is a posteriorly directed jet of
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation with Coanda effect. There is
blunting and reversal of systolic flow in the pulmonary veins,
consistent with increased LA pressure.

Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

POST-CPB:
There is a bileaflet mechanical prosthetic valve in the mitral
position. The valve is well-seated and the leaflets show normal
motion. There are the expected washing jets. No paravalvular
leaks are seen. The peak gradient across the mitral valve is
8mmHg, the mean gradient is 4mmHg. The pulmonary venous flow
pattern has normalized.
The RV systolic function appears mildly improved compared to
pre-op. The TR has improved to mild.
There is no residual shunt through the interatrial septum,
consistent with PFO repair. (A repair stitch was placed.)
The LV systolic function remains unchanged, estimated EF 50%.
There is no evidence of aortic dissection.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 75772**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2112-2-3**] for surgical
management of his mitral valve disease. He was worked-up in the
usual preoperative manner. On [**2112-2-4**], he was taken to the
operating room where he underwent a mitral valve replacement
using a mechanical valve. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. He later awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. Coumadin was started for anticoagulation. On
postoperative day two, Mr. [**Known lastname 75772**] developed ectopic atrial
rhythm with Wenckebach AV nodal conduction and subsequently had
atrial flutter with slow ventricular response in the 40s. AV
nodla agents were avoided and his rhythm was followed over
several days. Heparin was started and coumadin was held in
anticipation of placement of a permenant pacemaker. On
postoperative day 4, he was transferred to the step down unit
for further recovery. On [**2112-2-11**] he was taken to the EP lab and
had a permanent pacemaker placed.  This was interrogated by EP
and follow up appointment in the [**Hospital **] clinic was arranged.  He was
placed on Vanco for 48 hours after PPM was placed.  Infectious
disease was consulted as patient had a past medical history of
IVDU with S. salivarius mitral valve endocarditis complicated by
mycotic aneurysm s/p embolization and completion of 14 days of
gentamicin on [**9-22**] and >6 weeks of ceftriaxone on [**10-29**].  There
were no findings concerning for infection noted
intra-operatively and all cultures were negative.  No additional
antibiotics were recommended at this time. Mr. [**Known lastname 75772**] continued
to make steady progress and was discharged home on postoperative
day 11. His incisions were healing well, he was ambulating in
the halls without difficulty and he was tolerating a full oral
diet.  His INR was 2.1 and Heparin drip was stopped per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
He is to receive 7.5 mg Coumadin on [**2-15**] with INR to be drawn on
[**2-16**] - goal INR 3-3.5 for mechanical MVR.  He will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist and his primary care physician.
