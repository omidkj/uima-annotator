Operative Report:

PROCEDURE:  Exploratory laparotomy, washout, duodenal ulcer
[**Location (un) **]-patching and gastrojejunostomy tube.

ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal anesthesia.

IV FLUID:  500 cc.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  100 cc.

URINE OUTPUT:  300 cc.

INDICATIONS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 17327**] is a 60-year-old woman, with severe
COPD on high-dose steroids for exacerbation, who came in with
increasing abdominal pain over a 24-hour period. She had an
upright chest film that showed free air. She is on high-dose
steroids. She was tachycardiac and had peritonitis on
physical exam. Risks and benefits of surgery were offered
after surgical consult was obtained. The patient was taken
emergently into the operating room for an exploratory
laparotomy after consent was obtained.

PREPARATION:  The patient was taken to operating room after
intravenous antibiotics were administered. She was placed in
the supine position. Venodyne boots were placed and
activated. The patient was then endotracheally intubated in
the normal fashion. A timeout was performed. The patient was
sterilely prepped.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  An upper midline incision was made with
a #10 blade scalpel. Dissection of the anterior abdominal
fascia performed with electrocautery. The fascia was opened
with electrocautery. The abdomen was entered sharply around
the umbilicus. There were no adhesions from a previous
cesarean section. The fascial incision was extended with
electrocautery. There was purulent material in the upper
quadrants as well as the lower quadrants. The abdomen was
explored.

There was a hole in the anterior wall of the duodenum. This
was oversewn with 3-0 silk sutures. The abdomen was then
copiously washed out with sterile saline, and the effluent
was carefully removed. Omentum was then oversewn over the
defect with interrupted 3-0 silk sutures. The proximal
stomach was then aligned with a pursestring suture of 3-0
chromic. A gastrotomy was made, and a gastrojejunostomy tube
was passed through this opening with the tip in the proximal
jejunum. The balloon of the gastric portion was inflated, the
pursestring suture was closed, and the stomach was sutured to
the anterior abdominal wall at the entry site of the
gastrojejunostomy tube with 3-0 silk sutures. This was placed
to gravity. The abdomen was then further explored, and there
was no further bleeding, or fluid to remove.

The fascia was then closed with a running 0-PDS suture, one
begun superiorly, one inferiorly and tied in the middle. The
skin was irrigated. Bleeding was controlled with
electrocautery. The skin was reapproximated with skin
staples. The tube was then secured to the skin with 2-0 nylon
suture. The the patient was then transferred to the ICU,
intubated, given her poor pulmonary status preoperatively.
Specimens to pathology were anterior abdominal free-floating
fatty mass. Sponge, sharp and instrument counts correct x2
prior to closure. Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2819**] was present for the
entire procedure per HCFA regulations.

Swallow Study:

BEDSIDE SWALLOWING EVALUATION:

HISTORY:
Thank you for consulting on this 60 y/o female with CAD (s/p MI
x2 and stent '[**93**] and '[**01**]) and COPD on home O2 who woke up with
severe abdominal pain causing SOB and left shoulder pain
resolved
who was found with perforated duodenal ulcer and peritonitis.
She
went to the OR on [**2203-7-28**] for prmimary repair with G-J tube
placement. She was admitted to the SICU intubated, extubated
[**7-29**].
She was transferred to the floor and advanced to clear liquids
which she appeared to be tolerating well, but went into
respiratory distress and a code was called on [**8-3**]. Pt was
reintubated and transferred back to the unit. CXR showed "new
bilateral effusions present. There are increased interstitial
markings in the left lung and at the right base with sparing of
the right upper lung field, suggesting asymmetrical CHF."
Repeat
on [**8-6**] showed "Slight interval increase in atelectasis and
overlying effusion at the left lung base." while pt was NPO. The
pt was extubated [**8-6**] and has been tolerating extubation well.
She
has been taking ice chips without difficulty, but we were asked
to perform a bedside swallow evaluation prior to advancing the
pt
to a diet.

The pt today reported she can have difficulty swallowing when
she
tries to take several sips in a row, likely due to her COPD/SOB.
She reports she is sensate to aspiration, and sometimes has to
take breaks during meals [**12-30**] SOB, but denies any history of PNA.
She denied any difficulty swallowing while on the floor.

EVALUATION:
The examination was performed while the patient was seated
upright in the bed.
