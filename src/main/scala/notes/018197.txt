Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2179-9-14**] - PRE CPB The left atrium is moderately dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate to severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis with thinning and akinesis of the lateral wall.
Overall left ventricular EF is about 30%. At one point during
the pre bypass period, worsening global function was noted with
an EF of about 20%. This improved with nitroglycerine infusion.
The right ventricle displays normal free wall contractility.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results in the
operating room at the time of the procedure.
POST CPB The patient is receiving epinephrine by infusion. The
patient is being AV paced. There is normal right ventricular
systolic function. The left ventricle displays continued
akinesis of the lateral wall with improved function of the
remaining segments. The EF is around 40%. The mitral
regurgitation may be slightly worse. The thoracic aorta appears
intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 80153**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2179-9-10**] via transfer
from [**Hospital6 3105**] for surgical management of his
coronary artery disease. He was worked-up by the cardiac
surgical service in the usual preoperative manner. Heparin and
nitroglycerin were continued. Troponins were cycled which peaked
at 0.58 and began trending downward. On [**2179-9-14**], Mr. [**Known lastname 80153**] was
taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting to three vessels. Postoperatively he was taken
to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring.
Within 24 hours, Mr. [**Known lastname 80153**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact and was
extubated. Beta blockade, aspirin and a Statin were resumed. He
was then transferred to the step down unit for further recovery.
He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. The patient did have two
episodes of NSVT.  EP service was consulted and recommendations
to increase beta-blocker were implemented.  His hospital stay
was otherwise uneventful. On POD 5 he was discharged home with
visiting nurses.
