who fell down at home and was found at the bottom of an 11
foot staircase unresponsive at the scene.  When EMS arrived,
she was not moving.  She was intubated at the scene and had a
collar placed on and was transported to [**Hospital1 190**] on a board, unresponsive, with a cervical
collar placed on [**2105-6-22**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Multiple cerebrovascular accidents.
2.  Left hemiparesis.
3.  Diabetes mellitus.
4.  Hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Unknown.

1.  Aggrenox.
2.  Aspirin.
3.  Glucotrol.
4.  Prevacid.
5.  Zestril.
6.  Acebutolol.
7.  Celexa.

ALLERGIES:   She has allergies to intravenous dye.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her physical examination upon
presentation was temperature of 94.7 F.; pulse of 88 with a
blood pressure of 203/64.  She was [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2611**] Coma Score of
[**8-7**], non-responsive, opened her eyes at times.  Moved her
arms non-purposely.  HEENT:  Pupils were 3 mm and reactive.
The tympanic membranes were intact.  Her trachea was midline.
 Her heart was a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1,
S2. Her chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally without
crepitations, without obvious deformities.  Her abdomen was
soft and flat with decreased bowel sounds.  Extremities had
four plus distal pulses without deformity.  Her back had no
stepoff, no crepitations.  Rectal tone was normal.  She was
guaiac negative.

LABORATORY:  On presentation, white blood cell count of 20.1,
hematocrit of 30.0, platelets of 241.  Sodium of 133,
potassium 3.9, chloride 98, BUN of 26, creatinine of 0.9,
calcium of 1.1, lactate 1.5.  Her initial arterial blood gas
upon presentation was pH of 7.3 with a pCO2 of 42, pO2 of
259, bicarbonate of 30 and a base deficit of 3.

She had a head CT scan which revealed a right sided subdural
hematoma as well as a right frontotemporal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage.

Her chest CT scan showed a right small pneumothorax.
Abdominal and pelvic CT scan was negative.  Her neck CT scan
was consistent with degenerative changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit.  Neurosurgery was consulted for the
intraparenchymal hemorrhage as well as the subdural hematoma.
Neurosurgery came and evaluated the patient and decided that
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] bolt was necessary to monitor the patient's cranial
pressure.  The [**Last Name (un) **] bolt was placed without difficulty.

The patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit with
aggressive monitoring for her increased intracranial pressure
as well as her hemodynamic status.  She was intubated and
sedated in the Intensive Care Unit for several days while
responding to therapy.  The patient was extubated on [**6-28**],
without difficulty.  Early in the morning on [**6-29**], the
patient produced copious amounts of secretions and it was
necessary to be re-intubated for protection of her airway.

Subsequently, the lateral cervical spine films revealed a C2
fracture.  The patient had remained in the cervical collar
during her hospital duration due to the fact of being unable
to clinically clear her cervical spine.  Neurosurgery
commented on the fact that the patient has a C2 fracture and
that she should remain in a hard cervical collar for eight
weeks.  Following that re-intubation, the patient was again
stabilized in the Intensive Care Unit and was sedated while
intubated.

She was then extubated subsequently and was found to be
stable for transfer to the floor.  Prior to transfer to the
floor, she had an IVC filter placed for pulmonary embolism
prophylaxis.  While on the Floor, the patient had a modified
barium swallow which revealed a total swallow failure.

Interventional Radiology was asked to place percutaneous GJ
tube.  The patient had the GJ tube placed on Monday, the 8th.
She has been tolerating her tube feeds without difficulty.
She has been seen and evaluated by Physical Therapy who
recommended her for inpatient rehabilitation.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:   The patient's status at discharge
is stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Bilateral subdural hematomas with a frontotemporal
intraparenchymal bleed.
2.  C2 fracture.  She is to remain in a Cervical Collar for a
total duration of eight weeks.
3.  Status post IVC filter placed.
4.  Status post GJ feeding tube placement.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   Upon discharge, her physical examination
revealed the patient who was afebrile; her vital signs were
stable.  She had no complaints today.  Her tube feeds were at
goal.  Her chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  She
was soft, nontender, nondistended.  Her neurologic status
remained unchanged.

She was deemed stable for transfer to the rehabilitation
center as soon as a bed could be obtained.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient is to follow-up with the Trauma Surgery
Clinic in two to three weeks.
2.  She is to follow-up with Neurosurgery, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**], in
four weeks.
3.  She is to remain in her cervical collar for a combined
total of eight weeks; she has been hospitalized for 22 days
at this time.  She is to remain in her collar for another
five weeks upon discharge.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Acebutolol 400 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q. day.
3.  Amiodarone 200 mg q. day which is to be started on
[**2105-7-16**].
4.  Insulin sliding scale, see attached sheet.
5.  Lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q. day.
6.  Albuterol nebulized q. two hours p.r.n.
7.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously for deep venous
thrombosis prophylaxis.
