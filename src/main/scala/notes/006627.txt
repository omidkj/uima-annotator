Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
85 year old female with CAD s/p NSTEMI, PVD s/p left BKA, ESRD
on HD presenting from a [**Hospital1 1501**] with hypotension.  This is her third
hospitalization this month. From [**Date range (1) 94282**] she was
hospitalized for lower GI bleed, complicated by hypoxemia. The
hypoxemia was attributed to volume overload/CHF and was found to
have bilateral pleural effusions--she responded to
ultrafiltration/hemodialysis.  In regards to the GIB, she was
transfused 1 u prbc for HCT of 25.  She prepped for colonoscopy
multiple times, but was unsuccessful.  She was discharged to
rehab with a plan for outpatient colonoscopy.

She was hospitalized again on [**1-12**] for lower GI bleed/guaiac
positive stool at [**Hospital1 1501**]. Her HCT was stable. She refused
preparation for colonoscopy and refused further work up of her
effusions. She was discharged home with plan for outpatient
colonoscopy.

The day prior to admission, she went to HD and reports being
fatigued out of proportion to her baseline. She was in bed all
day, with decreased po intake.  She was told her stool was
guaiac positive--but she did not see it. On routine vitals, the
day of admission, she was found to be hypotensive--per report
from the ED, was 74/42. No [**Hospital1 1501**] documentation accompanies
patient.  She denied any symptoms at the time, but when she sat
up in bed to eat breakfast, she reports dizziness.  This symptom
accompanied movement during the course of the day, but was not
constant.  She denied vertigo, blurry vision, chest pain,
shortness of breath, abdominal pain or any other specific
symptoms.  She also reports a large stool this morning--but did
not see it and cannot tell if it was bloody/black/loose.

At arrival to the ED, her vitals were 97.8 95/50 82 18 100% 2L.
She had a single decrease in her BP to 89/34, but responded to
500 cc bolus. Her BP ranged 94-106/34-48.  She was given 1 gram
of Ceftriaxone for presumed pneumonia given her leukocytosis and
left shift.  CXR demonstrated bilateral effusions and CT abdomen
demonstrated bilateral effusions without an acute process.

Currently, she reports discomfort on her left hip from the bed.
She is hungry. She denies chest pain, lightheadedness, shortness
of breath, abdominal pain, ongoing loose stool, ongoing
dizziness or any other complaints.


Past Medical History:
1.CAD s/p NSTEMI in [**4-27**]. Medically managed, felt not to be
candidate for catheterization. Plavix had to be stopped due to
rectus sheath hematoma.  Post-MI echocardiogram demonstrated
regional LV systolic dysfunction with inferolateral/basal
inferior wall hypokinesis with EF of 50-55%, elevated LV filling
pressure and 1+ MR.
2. PVD s/p left BKA with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
3. Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus
4. Hypertension
5. Hyperlipidemia
6. ESRD on HD M/W/F
7. Positive PPD -- hospitalized at [**Hospital1 2025**], had 3 negative sputum
8. Lower GI Bleed--unable to tolerate colonoscopy prep as
inpatient, plan for outpatient procedure
9. Stage IV Decubitus ulcer, 2 ischial ulcers and heel ulcer.
10. Depression
11. Colon cancer s/p resection

Social History:
currently at rehab, lives alone with son in apartment below, no
tobacco, alcohol or drugs. Widowed

Family History:
Parents lived until 95. Cause of death is unknown, but patient
denies a family history of CAD/MI or early cardiac death.

CT abdomen: 1. Significant bibasilar pleural effusions with mass
effect on the adjacent lung parenchyma as described above. 2. No
evidence of free air or fluid in the intra-abdominal cavity. 3.
Interval decrease of the right rectus sheath hematoma. 4. Rectal
wall thickening. Recommend clinical correlation of possible
prolapse. 5. Diffuse diverticular disease without evidence of
acute diverticulitis. 6. Unchanged moderate-to-severe
degenerative diseases.
.
CXR: There is a large left pleural effusion and moderate right
pleural effusion with obscuration of bilateral hemidiaphragms.
No pneumothorax is detected. The heart is not well delineated
given effusions. A repeat chest radiograph may be helpful after
left thoracentesis.
.
Echo:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 0-10mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with hypokinesis of the basal 2/3rds of the inferior and
inferolatreal walls. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 45 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
prominent anterior fat pad..

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2145-5-1**],
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is now
identified. Regional and global left ventricular systolic
function are similar.
.
Urine cultures: preliminary staphylococcus and streptococcus.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypotension: Patient had an associated leukocytosis with left
shift concerning for infectious source. The patient remained
normotensive during her hospital stay. She received 1 bolus of
500cc NS, and did not require any pressors. She was noted to
have stage III ulcerations on admission, and wound care was
consulted. Blood cultures were drawn and were negative at time
of [**Year (4 digits) **]. She was found on urine culture to grow
staphyloccocus and streptococcus, speciation pending at time of
[**Year (4 digits) **], and is being treated empirically with vancomycin for
a total 10 day course, to be completed at dialysis. She was also
transfused 1 u prbc for HCT of 23, and hematocrit remained
stable thereafter.
.
2. Bilateral effusions: noted over the last several admissions.
Likely related to volume overload/diastolic CHF. Patient has
refused work up/thoracentesis in the past, and continues to
refuse on this admission. She was weaned to 2L of oxygen at time
of [**Year (4 digits) **]. She will need continued fluid removed at dialysis.

.
3. LGIB: recent admissions for lower GI bleed. Unable to
tolerate colonoscopy prep as inpatient, procedure scheduled for
early [**Month (only) 404**]. No stool in vault in ED for guaiac.  HCT was 23
on [**1-17**] and patient given 1 u prbc given hypotension, positive
troponin and history of bleeding. She remained stable througho
