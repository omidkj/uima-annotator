Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is an 84 year old male
with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia,
positive family history of coronary artery disease and a
positive history of tobacco use with about ten days of
intermittent chest pain.

The patient had one severe episode about five to six days ago
while gardening and "tried to work through it" but the pain
became about 7 out of 10 without any associated shortness of
breath.  The patient continued to develop intermittent
substernal chest pressure and eventually presented to [**Hospital3 6454**] the morning of admission to [**Hospital1 190**].

He was found to have diffuse ST segment depressions and Q
waves that were new since EKG in [**2112**].  The patient was
treated with heparin, 2 B3A inhibitor, and Nitroglycerin, all
of which was unsuccessful in eliminating the pain.  The
patient soon became hypotensive and required normal saline
bolus.  The patient had a short run of non-sustained
ventricular tachycardia.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 69**], the
patient was hypotensive with systolic in the 80s to 90s which
initially responded to normal saline bolus.  The patient
continued to have unrelieved chest pain and was then taken to
the catheterization laboratory.  The patient soon became
hypotensive with systolic to the 60s requiring initiation of
Dopamine drip.

In the catheterization laboratory the patient became confused
and then suffered an asystolic cardiac arrest.  CPR was
immediately initiated and the patient was intubated.  The
patient regained spontaneous pulse after about three to five
minutes of CPR and an intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted.
a diagnostic catheterization showed a heavily calcified
critical ostial left main stenosis and mild mid right
coronary artery disease.

Given the patient's high risk of mortality if he were to
undergo emergent coronary artery bypass graft, the decision
was made to proceed with left main stenting which was
successful.  The patient was then transferred to the Coronary
Care Unit, intubated, on maximum dopamine and Levaquin drips,
and with his intra-aortic balloon pump.  The patient's family
was made aware of the critical situation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes mellitus.
2.  Peripheral vascular disease status post lower extremity
stenting about three to four years ago; the patient has
chronic claudication.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Hydrochlorothiazide.
2.  Minipress.
3.  Labetalol.
4.  Accupril.
5.  Glucotrol.

MEDICATIONS ON CORONARY CARE UNIT ARRIVAL:
1.  Dopamine 20 micrograms per kilo per minute.
2.  Levophed 40 mics per minute.
3.  Integrilin drip.
4.  Propofol drip.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient lives with his wife and is very
active, gardens and volunteers at [**Hospital3 1280**] Hospital.  Quit
tobacco use 20 years ago.  Denies alcohol use.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

LABORATORY:  Pertinent data on admission:  EKG shows sinus
tachycardia at 123 beats per minute, left axis deviation, Q
waves in III and AVF.  ST depressions in V4 through V6.  Q
waves also in AVL and V1 through V3.

White blood cell count 8.2, hematocrit 33.6, platelets 144,
INR 1.3, PTT 150, creatinine 2.3.  Potassium 5.8.  CK 226, CK
MB 31, index 13.7.  Blood gas on arrival to Coronary Care
Unit was 7.27 by 33 by 246 by 16.  Lactate was 1.3.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On physical examination, the
patient's heart rate was 120, blood pressure 131/42,
ventilator was set at AC20 by 800 by 50% by 5% PEEP;
pulmonary artery pressure was 48/25.  In general, the patient
was sedated and intubated with an ET-tube in place.
Pulmonary:  Barrel chested; good movement of air.  No
crackles or wheezes.  Cardiovascular is regular rate and
rhythm, no rubs, gallops or murmurs.  No jugular venous
distention, no peripheral edema.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities cool.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was eventually
transitioned from Dopamine and Levophed to Neo-Synephrine
which was relatively rapidly weaned off over the course of a
day or two.  He was continued on aspirin, Plavix and statin.

His intra-aortic balloon pump was removed after two days and
he was able to maintain adequate cardiac output without it.
His Swan-Ganz catheter was also removed.  After removal of
the balloon pump and Swan, the patient was started on a beta
blocker.

After tolerating this, he was started on Isordil and
Hydralazine.  The patient had one episode of atrial
tachycardia with a rate of 140.  This broke with carotid
massage.  This episode was asymptomatic.  Hydralazine was
discontinued and beta blocker was increased as tolerated.
ACE inhibitor was not started because of the patient's renal
failure.

2.  ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  The patient's creatinine
rose to 3.8, where it stayed for three days.  The patient was
able to maintain urine output on his own the whole time.  The
patient's phosphate did increase and he was started on
calcium carbonate three times a day for phosphate binding.
Acute on chronic renal failure was attributed to dye load
plus cardiogenic shock.

3.  RIGHT LOWER LOBE PNEUMONIA:  For several days the patient
spiked a fever.  He was started empirically on Vancomycin and
Levaquin.  The Vancomycin was started because the patient's
intra-aortic balloon pump insertion was not considered
completely sterile.  Blood cultures and sputum cultures
remained negative, although one sputum Gram stain on [**4-16**]
did show Gram negative rods.

Chest x-ray also showed a right lower lobe infiltrate
obscuring the right diaphragm.  Vancomycin was eventually
discontinued and the patient was afebrile for greater than 48
hours at the time of discharge.  The patient did not have a
cough or shortness of breath or desaturation.

4.  VENTILATORY SUPPORT:  The patient was intubated during
the Code and was extubated a few days later, two and a half
days.  The patient was maintained on a Propofol drip while he
was intubated.  When the Propofol drip was decreased, the
patient woke right up and there were no complications with
extubation.

5.  ANEMIA:  The anemia was attributed to chronic renal
failure plus oozing from the patient's line site, plus the
presence of the intra-aortic balloon pump.  The patient was
transfused as needed to keep his hematocrit greater than 30
and his hematocrit was indeed greater than 30 at the time of
discharge.

6.  THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  The patient's platelets began to fall
soon after the insertion of the intra-aortic balloon pump.
After the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed, the
patient's platelets recovered.

7.  DIABETES MELLITUS:  The patient was started on an insulin
drip but presumably due to his renal failure, soon developed
problems with hypoglycemia.  The insulin drip was
discontinued and the patient was given D50 as needed.
Eventually, as the patient began to eat, his blood glucose
began to rise again and he was covered with a Regular insulin
sliding scale.

8.  PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was maintained on a proton pump
inhibitor and subcutaneous heparin.  Subcutaneous heparin was
not administered while the balloon pump was in.  While the
balloon pump was in, the patient was covered with 250 Units
per hour drip of heparin intravenously.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   The patient is stable for transfer to
rehabilitation, most likely [**Hospital3 245**] at [**Location (un) 38**].

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  He is to follow-up with his primary care
physician/Cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 17234**], whose office number is

patient at rehabilitation.
2.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] will need a repeat cardiac catheterization in
three months.
