Date of Birth:  [**2117-9-11**]             Sex:   F

Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Hydralazine / Opioid Analgesics / Compazine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain / epigastric pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Coronary artery bypass grafts x 4 (LIMA-LAD,SV-DG,SV-OM,SV-PDA)
[**1-13**]
left heart catheterization, coronary angiography


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 74 year-old female who has a significant PMH
for recent NSTEMI ([**2191-11-5**]), CAD, hyperlipidemia,
hypertension, DM-2, and ESRD on hemodialysis who presented after
several hours of epigastric pain which evolved into predominant
complaint of [**2193-8-13**] chest pressure.  She had a similar
presentation on [**2191-11-22**] and was diagnosed with an NSTEMI after
positive cardiac enzymes noted with new LBBB on EKG. She
underwent cardiac catheterization at that time which showed LAD
lesion of 90% and totally occluded mid LAD lesion, RCA lesion of
90%, and circumflex showed minimal disease. Unfortunately, she
had unsuccessful PCI, and CT Surgery consulted to arrange for
future CABG plan.

Past Medical History:
-Hypothyroidism (thyroidectomy in [**2173**] for benign growth)
-Diabetes type II for >10yrs
-End-Stage Renal Disease: on hemodialysis left forearm AV graft
in [**2187**], now using Tunelled HD Line
-CVA [**2186**]: left caudate infarct; several mini-strokes before
that
-Gait disorder/shaky and unsteady when she walks
-Splenectomy in [**2145**] (trauma related)
-SVC stenosis
-Cataract surgery (bilateral)
-Hypertension
-Hyperlipidemia
-Coronary Artery Disease (recent cath [**11/2191**] showing 90%
proximal LAD totally occluded mid LAD and 90% RCA and minimal
disease of the circumflex)


Social History:
Patient lives alone at home but daughter [**Name (NI) **]([**Telephone/Fax (1) 108910**])
is extensively involved in her care. She has 7 other children.
She uses a walker at baseline, but has been wheelchair bound for
about 1 year per daughter because patient is afraid of
falling. She denies current or past tobacco, alcohol or illicit
drug use.


Family History:
Mother: died 5 year ago (cause unknown to pt)
Father: died when pt was 17 (cause unknown to pt)
Children have no major medical problems
