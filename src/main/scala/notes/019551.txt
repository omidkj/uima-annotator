Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
Sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
This is an 84 year old male with a history of emphysema, atrial
fibrillation, type II diabetes, and history of AAA repair who
presents from [**Hospital3 **] hospital with hematuria, hematemasis and
elevated lactate.  History is taken per the patient's family.
He presented twice to Cape Code hospital within the past 24
hours.  His initial presentation was for hematuria for which he
was prescribed ciprofloxacin.  He presented again with
hematemasis and respiratory distress.  He was found to be
tachypnic and unresponsive and was intubated.  He had a foley
catheter placed which was subsequently palpable in the patient's
scrutum.  He received methylprednisolone, albuterol, atrovent,
succinylcholine, etomidate, propofol and zosyn.  He had a CT
abdomen and pelvis, the results are pending.  He was transferred
here for further management.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.2 P 116 BP 106/76 R 25 96 O2
sat, Vent settings not listed.  Noted to have new renal failure
and elevated lactate. The patient underwent a urology
evaluation, cystoscopy and foley placement attempt. He received
Levaquin, Versed and Propofol. Head CT here wnl.  Abdominal CT
initially concerning for free air in abdomen.  Also of note, the
patient was found to have unequal pupils R (surgical) pupil 5mm,
L pupil 1mm, that resolved after a negative Head CT.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient is intubated and sedated.
When sedation is lightened, the patient is non responsive.
Urology is present and attempting to replace the patient's Foley
catheter that does not appear to be in place.
.
A discussion with his wife reveals recent hematemesis for the
past 24 hours with hospitalization, the details of her story
were unclear.  Additionally, she reports a medical history of
only "aneurysms down the front" which have been repaired by a
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**Location (un) 945**].

[**12-29**] CXR:
Cardiac size is normal. NG tube tip is out of view below the
diaphragm but
likely in the stomach. Right IJ catheter tip is in the upper
SVC. Left
transvenous pacemaker lead terminates in unchanged position one
in the right atrium and the second one could be just at the
entrance of the right
ventricle. Moderate to large right pleural effusion has
minimally increased in size. Right IJ catheter tip in the
cavoatrial junction. Bilateral pulmonary enlargement is stable.
The lungs are hyperinflated due to emphysema. Right apical
opacity likely related with past tuberculosis and fibrotic
changes is stable. Left apical pleural thickening is also
stable.  Asymmetric opacification of the lungs that is mild,
greater on the right side has increased on the right mid lung
and suggest a new area of infectious process. Otherwise mild
edema is stable.

[**12-26**] UE US:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right
arm. The right cephalic vein could not be identified.

[**12-21**] CTA Head:
IMPRESSION: No significant abnormalities on CT angiography of
the head.

[**12-21**] CT Head:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute hemorrhage or vascular territorial
infarction.
2. Evidence of remote infarction, possibly embolic.

[**12-19**] TTE:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are thickened. There
is moderate pulmonic valve stenosis. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in
the presence of elevated right sided pressures.

IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic LV systolic function. There is an
increased gradient seen along the right ventricular outflow
tract. This could be from infra-pulmonic, supra-pulmonic or
pulmonic valve stenosis. There may be extrinsic compression of
the RVOT/proximal pulmonary artery causing this gradient. No
other valvular abnormality seen. No evidence of endocarditis
(cannot exclude). Small anteriori pericardial effusion without
evidence of tamponade.

[**12-18**] CT Cystogram/Pelvis:
1. The Foley catheter is within the urinary bladder. There is no
evidence of contrast leak. Multiple bladder diverticula are
seen.
2. Minimal amount of free air as well as small volume of free
fluid within
the deep pelvis (subperitoneal), consistent with history of
recent Foley
trauma.

[**12-18**] CXR (official read):
1. ET tube and NG tube as described above. The NG tube should be
advanced.
2. Left lower lobe peribronchiolar opacity concerning for
possible
aspiration. Follow up radiograph is recommmended.
3. Biapical pleural scarring, fibrosis and volume loss. Mild
right CP angle blunting. Likely due to granulomatous infection
(TB). The chronicity of this findings is unknown, follow up is
recommended.

[**12-18**] CT abdomen/pelvis:
. Malpositioning of the Foley catheter. The tip of the Foley
catheter is
seen outside of the urethra in the soft tissues of the left
hemipelvis with surrounding subperitoneal fluid, representing a
mixture of urine and
hemorrhage. The balloon of the Foley catheter is inflated in the
prostatic
portion of the urethra.
2. Trabeculated bladder with multiple large bladder diverticula
as described above.
3. No free intra-abdominal air.
4. Status post aorto-biiliac bypass.
5. Compression fracture of L1 of indeterminate age.

[**12-18**] CT Head:
MPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage.
NOTE AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The hypodensity, likely representing
chronic small vessel infarction, is most evident in the right
frontal periventricular white matter.

OSH Head CT: Head CT: Encephalomalacia is noted within the R
frontal lobe, prior infarct, no hemorrhage.
Head CT: IMPRESSION: No evidence of hemorrhage.
NOTE AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The hypodensity, likely representing
chronic small vessel infarction, is most evident in the right
frontal periventricular white matter.
