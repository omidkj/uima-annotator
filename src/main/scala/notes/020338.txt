Allergies:
Codeine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5810**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
63F with h/o EtOH abuse with prior withdrawal symptoms and
pancreatitis (per report from the ED residents, patient reports
that she does not recall the having the diagnosis of
pancreatitis), presenting to the ED with abdominal pain for
approximately one day, reports some nausea and no emesis. She
was recently hospitalized per reports at [**Hospital1 2025**] for similar issues
but left AMA. At [**Hospital1 2025**], she was on the ventilator for about [**2-18**]
days for aspiration and also developed MSSA pneumonia treated
with nafcillin. She reported pain localized in the
mid-epigastric region and radiating to the back intermittently.
She also endorses recent falling down the stairs the day prior
to admission with ecchymosis of the right ankle. Her initial BP
in the ER fluctuated with a maximum of 203/130.
.
Date of last drink per ER note was 2 days prior to admission
([**2194-5-31**]) and amount is usually [**12-19**] bottle (unknown if liquor).


She was receiving valium 10 mg IV q 6 hr and ativan 10-12 mg per
CIWA scale. She was admitted to the SICU

She was admitted to the SICU given severe pancreatitis, need for
aggressive benzo and labetalol regimen. She was initially placed
on hydral but required clonidine patch. She was requiring large
amounts of lorazepam for high CIWA scores ([**8-2**]). Valium was
started at 5 mg q 6 hr and increased to 10 mg. Ativan was used
as needed. Dilaudid was used for pain control. She was continued
on high benzodiazepine and opioid requirement. Hemodynamically,
she had sinus tachycardia to 130s. It was also noted that her
Hgb was trending down slowly since admission (admission 14.8 -->
8.6). She was eventually started on dexametatomidine due to
agitation and hypertension.

Labs are significant for
WBC 24.3 --> 8.7
Hgb 14.8 --> 8.6
Plt 778 --> 212
coags had INR peak at 1.8 and down to 1.1
Cr 1.7 --> 0.4

ALT 290 --> 1782 --> 787
AST 566 --> 2805 --> 218
LD 1564 --> 3720 --> 398
Lipase 3200 --> 87

On transfer, the patient went into respiratory distress
(wheezing, accessory muscle usage, stable pOx) requiring
intubation. Last ABG at [**2194-6-6**] 23:18 was pO2 127 pCO2 52 pH
7.35 HCO3 30. Secretions noted from ET tube and cultured. CXR
suggestive of ? pulmonary edema.

Past Medical History:

- ? hepatitis and fatty liver infiltration (per MRI report at
[**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**])

[**6-2**] CT ABD w/ Contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Acute pancreatitis with extensive peripancreatic stranding
and fluid, but no evidence of necrosis. Focal fluid collection
measuring up to 5.4 cm is identified superior to the pancreas.
2. Non-occlusive thrombus within the main portal and
portosplenic confluence.  The splenic vein is completely
thrombosed.
3. Heterogeneous perfusion to the liver which may represent
perfusion
abnormality due to portal vein thrombus or focal fatty
infiltration.

[**6-7**] CXR:
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2194-6-3**].
The ET tube tip is relatively low, 2.5 cm above the carina. The
left
subclavian line tip is at the level of mid SVC.
There is interval development of moderate-to-severe pulmonary
edema associated by bilateral pleural effusions. There is also
left lower lobe opacity consistent with interval development of
atelectasis.

[**6-7**] ECHO:
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**6-7**] NonContrast Head CT:
There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass, mass effect, or
infarction. No shift of the usually midline structures is
identified.  Mild proportional enlargement of the ventricles and
sulci is consistent with age-related cortical atrophy.
Periventricular hypoattenuation is most likely secondary to
small vessel ischemic disease. There is no acute skull fracture
or scalp laceration. The visualized paranasal sinuses and left
mastoid air cells are well aerated. The right mastoid air cells
appear diminutive.

[**6-8**] CTA CHEST:
1. Multifocal acute PE involving distal right branch, right
upper/lower
lobes, and left lower lobe, with probable developing pulmonary
infarcts.
2. Bilateral lower lobe collapse and new moderate pleural
effusions.
3. Anasarca and mild abdominal ascites.

[**6-14**] CXR:
Interval removal of the left subclavian central line. A
nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the
tip within the stomach.
Endotracheal tube is unchanged in position with its tip 3-4 cm
above the
carina. Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the
superior vena cava. Right lung appears clear. There is a
persistent left basilar opacity which most likely reflects
combination of compressive atelectasis and effusion, although an
infectious process cannot be excluded. No evidence of pulmonary
edema or pneumothorax. Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours
appear stable. Aorta is somewhat unfolded and tortuous. Interval
resolution of interstitial edema.

[**6-15**]: EKG
Sinus rhythm. Non-specific T wave changes. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2194-6-8**] the ventricular rate has increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
63F long h/o EtOH abuse with severe pancreatitis and
non-occlusive PV thrombus and complete thrombosis of splenic
vein with hospital course complicated by PE and MSSA pneumonia.
