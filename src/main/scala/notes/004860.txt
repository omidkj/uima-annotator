Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with drug-eluting stent x 2 to SVG graft
to OM2, with angioseal placement, [**2145-5-3**].


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname 1692**] [**Known lastname 90394**] is a 85 year old male with a history of CAD s/p
CABG and stenting, unclear arrythmia s/p ablation, and HTN who
is transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital for further evaluation
and cardiac catheterization.

Mr. [**Known lastname 90394**] reports that he has had increasing chest pain over
the past several weeks, beginning after he had an ablation
procedure on [**4-7**].  Initially the chest pain was just with
exertion but now he has been having chest pain at rest as well.
The pain is substernal and radiates to the left side under the
breast.  At times it is associated with shortness of breath.
There is no associated nausea, diaphoresis, or radiation of pain
to the jaw or arms.  He initially presented to [**Hospital **]
Hospital on [**4-30**] with chest pain.  He had a cardiac
catheterization that showed in stent restenosis of his SVG to
OM2 graft and some chronic occlusions in other vessels.  Plan
was initially to transfer him to [**Hospital1 18**] on monday for PCI of SVG
to OM2, however, he developed chest pain on the evening of [**5-1**].
 Pain worsened on the morning of [**5-2**] and heparin gtt and
nitroglycerin gtt were started.  Cardiac enzymes were negative.
Integrillin gtt was started for persistent symptoms.  He was
noted to have ST depressions in V4-V6 and was transfered for
further management and potential PCI tonight vs. in the morning.
 En route he received fentanyl 150 mg, and heparin, integrillin
and nitro gtts were all continued.

On review of systems, he notes a prior history of TIA about 25
years ago.  He also has chronic constipation and notes that he
has not moved his bowels in the last 4 days.  He denies any
prior history of stroke, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or
calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for chest pain, dyspnea on
exertion.  He denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

On arrival to the CCU the patient was complaining of [**3-25**] chest
pain.  EKG demonstrated ST depressions in V4-V6.  Shortly
thereafter his chest pain resolved.

RELEVANT STUDIES:
CARDIAC CATH:  [**2145-4-30**] at OSH:
- Right dominant
- Left main, small 30% mid stenosis
- LAD 100% ostial, chronic occlusions
- LCX - 1st OM with mild luminal irregularities.  Mid circumflex
chronically occluded
- RCA - 20% diffuse prximal stenosis. Large, normal PDA. Large
PL branch with mild luminal irregularities.
- LIMA to LAD - Tortuous, widely patient.  LIMA touches down in
the mid LAD and backfills to the ostium of the LAD, as well as
multiple septal branches and two small diagonal branches.  The
mid and distal LAD is small in caliber with mild diffuse disease
distally.
- SVG to RPDA: Occluded
- SVG to OM2: The proximal SVG stent has a focal 90% stenosis as
a result of in stent restenosis.  There is then a focal 60-70%
proximal stenosis in the SVG just outside the distal stent edge.
 The distal SVG has a 95 stenosis which extends into the
anastomosis of the medium 2nd OM branch which has an ostial 95%
stenosis.

CXR [**2145-5-2**]:
Low lung volumes exaggerate heart size and pulmonary vascular
crowding, but there is probably mild pulmonary congestion. There
is no focal consolidation or appreciable pleural effusion. No
pneumothorax.
