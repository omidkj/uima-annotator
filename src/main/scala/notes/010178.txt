Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3561**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy
G-tube placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 40-year-old with history of ALL s/p allo BMT [**2151**], c/b
radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis, underwent left lower lobe
transplant [**2170**], this was c/b left mainstem bronchomalacia, s/p
stenting, recently s/p bronchoscopy on [**2182-12-9**] for cryo to
granulation tissue now presenting with respiratory distress.
.
History was obtained from medical records. On [**2182-12-9**], the
patient underwent bronchoscopy for cryotherapy debridment of the
metallic left main stent under rigid bronchoscopy followed by
esophageal dilation via thoracic surgery.  Her post operative
course was complicated by respiratory distress and profound
bronchospasm, which responded to positive pressure noninvasive
ventilation and albuterol nebs. The patient was monitored
overnight, and discharged on [**2182-12-10**].  The patient presented to
an OSH ED on [**2182-12-11**] early am complaining of SOB that had
started the prior evening.  At OSH ED the pt was noted to have a
pneumonia, and received levoquin 750mg and 500cc NS. The patient
was transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further management.
.
At the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, the pt's initial vitals were 98.3 92 126/72 18
100% NRB. Patient was found to have worsening shortness of
breath, was tachypneic to 30s with ABG: 7.18/85/166. The pt was
intubated and bronchoscopy was performed. ABG after intubation
showed: 7.00/99/196. Vent changed with decreased volume and
increased rate. Blood pressures dropped after being sedated. An
A line and CVL (femoral) were placed. Sedation stopped with
improvement in blood pressures. Two liters IVF given.  Patient
was started on neosynephrine with mild improvement in blood
pressures. Given Vanc/Zosyn.


Past Medical History:
-ALL - [**2147**], treated with Vincristine, prednisone,
Methotrexate, Adriamycin (total 450 mg/m2), 6MP and
L-Asparaginase, and cranial XRT. Bone marrow relapse [**2150**]
treated with COAP, stopped secondary to toxicity. Reinduced with

Prednisone, L-Asparaginase and oral Methotrexate in [**2151**] and
underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplant with whole body
radiation.
-Small bowel perforation - [**2167**]
-Pulmonary fibrosis and left lobe transplant - [**2170**],
complicated by pericardial and pleural effusion
-Staph aureus bronchitis - [**2171**]

CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS [**2182-12-22**]
1. Interval improvement in right lower lobe consolidation,
however
development of patchy consolidations and ground-glass opacities
throughout
almost the entire left lung. Ground-glass opacity also involves
the right
lower lobe and right upper lobe. The differential diagnosis is
broad, as
findings are nonspecific, and includes infection, edema and
hemorrhage.
2. No specific signs of empyema, however, superinfection of
simple pleural
effusions cannot be excluded.
3. No abdominal fluid collection.
4. Decompressed distal descending and sigmoid colon. No clear
wall thickening.
5. Trace abdominal ascites.
6. Mild perirectal stranding. The differential diagnosis
includes proctitis and third spacing in the setting of fluid
overload.
.
ECHO [**2182-12-23**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-5**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild moderate mitral regurgitation. Normal
biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-3-6**], the
findings are similar.
.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2179**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.
.
G-TUBE PLACEMENT [**2182-12-25**]:
Successful uncomplicated placement of 12 French Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 12433**]
gastrostomy feeding tube. The tube can be used after 24 hours
and needs to be left to
gravity drainage overnight.
.
LENIS [**2182-12-20**]:
No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.
.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND [**2182-12-31**]:  No ascites in all four
quadrants.  No subcutaneous fluid collection about G-tube
insertion site.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 40-year-old woman with a history of ALL, s/p BMT [**2151**]
