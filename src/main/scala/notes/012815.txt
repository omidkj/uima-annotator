History of Present Illness:
This is a 54 yo female with h/o ESRD on HD, DM2, CAD s/p stents
x 8 at [**Hospital1 112**], severe AS, now healed ulcer of RLE [**1-6**] calciphylaxis
recently admitted [**9-/2189**] with altered mental status now
admitted with substernal CP. Pt developed R sided chest pain
today radiating to R neck toward end of HD session a/w nausea
diaphoresis, SOB and was similar to prior MI.  Pain felt like a
pressure, like "someone was sitting on my chest." Also complains
of neck pain since saturday.  Has never had neck pain before,
and since Saturday has had neck pain radiating to both
shoulders.  Not tender to palpation at neck, shoudlers, or
chest.  Pain improved to [**4-13**] with nitro x 2. In ambulance, had
STE 1mm, now resolved, on arrival to ED.
.
In the ED, she received ASA 325. CXR neg. On exam, pt obese, abd

drip. Developed hypotension with nitro gtt, dropped to 90s
systolic. Vs prior to transfer: 80 18 98%1LNC 148/46.
.
On arrival to floor, she is chest pain free, no shortness of
breath.  Only complains of shoulder and [**Last Name (un) 78953**] pain that has been
consistent since Friday.  No chest pain, sob, nausea or other
complaints.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black

TTE [**2189-11-19**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are focal calcifications in
the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is moderate-to-severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.9 cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-6**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Cardiac cath [**2189-11-20**]:
1. No angiographicall-apparent high grade flow-limiting CAD,
with
mild-diffuse in-stent restenosis of the LAD and RCA.
2. Mildly elevated PCW consistent with mild left ventricular
diastolic
dysfunction.
3. Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.
4. Peripheral arterial disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
 54 yo female with h/o ESRD on HD, DM2, CAD s/p stents x 8 at
[**Hospital1 112**], severe AS, now healed ulcer of RLE [**1-6**] calciphylaxis
presented initially with substernal CP, elevated trop, CK/MB
wnl, likely from worsening AS
.
# Chest pain/Aortic stenosis:  Chest pain initially was
concerning for ACS vs demand ischemia in the setting of dialysis
and severe AS.  She was noted to have EKG changes prior to
arrival to hospital, but had no elevation in enzymes.
Considering her cardiac history, she was treated with heparin
gtt for concern for unstable angina and home plavix, aspirin,
bb, and statin were continued.  Outpatient cardiologist, Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital1 112**], was contact[**Name (NI) **] who recommended not
repeating cardiac cath considering she had had [**7-15**] stents
already in place and caths prior.  She had a second episode of
chest pain the day after admission, which worsened during
dialysis, with no EKG change and no elevation of enzymes,
medical management was continued.  Echo was done that day which
showed severe AS with valve area 0.9 cm2.
.
She was taken back to dialysis the following day for
ultrafiltration, since she was above her dry weight.  During
that dialysis session, she complained of chest pain and became
unresponsive and code blue was called. Throughout the episode,
she remained normotensive with a strong pulse and in NSR on
telemetry. EKG showed noted to have STE in V2-V4. She was
treated wit
