Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2751**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 40 year old woman with no significant past
medical history who complains of progressive cough and shortness
of breath for three weeks.  She had been seen at [**Hospital1 2292**] as an outpatient a couple of times over the last few
weeks.  At the first PCP visit, nothing was seen on CXR.  When
she revisited PCP office last week, he sent her to the [**Hospital1 2025**] ED
directly where they diagnosed her with multifocal pneumonia by
CXR and started her on levofloxacin with no improvement in
symptoms over the last week.  She notes that her dyspnea
continued to worsen and she was having difficulty breathing in
the shower today, so she presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.2  HR 134  BP 115/67  O2sat 90%
on RA.  In the ED, patient triggered for hypoxia to 88-89% on RA
and increased work of breathing.  She was noted to be dyspneic
with RR in 30s, only able to speak one to two words, improved on
4L O2 by nasal canula with RR 25-26.  She was also given
Duonebs.  She was visibly still dyspneic on 6L O2 by nasal
canula, initially able to speak [**3-6**] words, then progressively
tachypneic even on 6L NC.  She was given a dose of IV solumedrol
and duonebs, after which she felt improved but still with RR
30-35.  CXR did not show any significant findings, so CTA of
chest was done to rule out PE. Chest CT showed diffuse
ground-glass opacities bilaterally.  She was given 1L NS, and
antibiotics were broadened in the ED to IV Vancomycin and Zosyn.
 She was noted to be persistently tachycardic in the 130s,
decreased to 110s with 1L of NS.  Vitals in ED prior to transfer
to MICU are as follows: HR 120 BP 146/121 RR 31  O2sat 96% 6 L
NC.

Imaging:
-CT-A Chest [**2194-1-30**]-
No evidence for pulmonary embolus. Bilateral multifocal ground
glass opacities with broad differential diagnosis, including
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **], and atypical pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage,
hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and early pulmonary alveolar
proteinosis. Close follow-up of patient is recommended and
pulmonary consult if indicated.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2194-1-31**] 7:42 PM
There has been improved aeration of the opacity at the right
base. The
cardiac silhouette and mediastinum is normal. There is no
pleural effusion or signs of overt pulmonary edema.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2194-2-5**] 8:12 AM
Prelim: Findings most suggestive of hypersensitivity pneumonitis
or asthma. History of any offending [**Doctor Last Name 360**] would be helpful to
confirm the former. Otherwise, correlation with pulmonary
function tests and/or lavage may be helpful
.
EKG:  sinus tachycardia, rate 124


Brief Hospital Course:
40F with no significant past medical history who presents with
three weeks of progressive shortness of breath and cough
admitted to the ICU with hypoxemia and respiratory distress.
.
# Hypoxemia: Pt initially triggered in ED for hypoxia. She
arrived to the MICU satting 95% on 6L nc. She appeared to have
increased work of breathing. CT scan showed ground-glass
opacities consistent with pneumocystis, [**Doctor Last Name **], BOOP, or
respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease or DIP.  She
had not adequately responded to azithromycin or levofloxacin,
which were prescribed as an outpatient.  HIV test returned
negative, as was respiratory viral antigen testing. Induced
sputum and PCP smear were also sent and showed moderate growth
respiratory commensal organisms. The patient was initially
started on vancomycin /zosyn /azithromycin / bactrim and
steroids (40 mg [**Hospital1 **]) empirically given the severity of her
hypoxia.  Her antibiotics were discontinued on [**2193-2-2**] as her she
had previously not responded to antibiotics and her symptoms
improved with the initiation of steroids. She was called out ot
the floor and was started on steroids 40 mg daily. The pulmonary
consult team saw her and recommended continuing her on steroids
40 mg daily with clinic follow-up in 2 weeks for what is
presumed to be a hypersensitivity pneumonitis. She was satting
well on RA upon discharge, but still had some O2 ambulatory sats
in the 85%, and thus was also written for home O2 oxygen.

# She was on subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
Communication was with the patient and her husband. She remained
full code during this admission.

# PENDING STUDIES:
- ANCA
- [**Doctor First Name **]

# OUTPATIENT FOLLOW UP:
- Consider decreasing steroids as tolerate
- Reconsider the need for home O2
