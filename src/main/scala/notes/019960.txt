massive distension, sludge, stones, surrounding fluid, and a
positive [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign. CXR demonstrated interstitial edema. EKG
showed NSR with rate of 60 with PAC, NA, NI TWF and TWI in
V1/V2. Rectal exam demonstrated guaiac positive green stool. She
was given Zosyn and Vanc and was admitted to the MICU for
further management. She received 3L of IVFs and her BP increased

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F with h/o dementia, COPD, HTN, and CAD s/p MI who was a/w
leukocytosis, anemia, and abdominal pain, found to have acute
cholecystitis now s/p IR perc drainage with clinical
improvement.
.
#. Acute Cholecystitis: Pt p/w RUQ pain, leukocytosis, and
low-grade fever at her rehab.  Subsequent RUQ U/S in the ED
demonstrated acute gallbladder inflammation and a positive
[**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign, consistent with cholecystitis.  Started on Zosyn
in the ED which was continued in the MICU. Abdominal radiology
placed percutaneous drain in the gallbladder draining 200 cc of
bile.  Per radiology, difficult to penetrate the gallbladder
indicative of prolonged acute cholecystitis. Pt was continued on
zosyn x6days and then cx grew pansensitive citrobacter so abx
were narrowed to flagyl 800mg TID x10d and a prolonged course of
ciprofloxacin 500mg q24h, course will be defined at a later
date. Pt had pain control with PO dilaudid 1-2mg q2h prn. She
will have general surgery follow up in 2wks to determine when
the drain will be pulled and help define antibiotic course.

#. Anemia: Pt with 11-point hct drop since the summer. S/p 2U
PRBC in MICU with appropriate bump in HCT from 24 -> 28. Hx of
duodenal ulcers s/p gastrectomy > 25y ago.  Found to have
guiaic+ stool in ED, although she denies BRBPR or melenotic
stool.  Pt has had colonoscopy in the past (dx with polyps).
Unclear whether this is acute or chronic as pt initially guiaic
positive but now neg and hct now stable. Pt remained stable
throughout the rest of her admission. COntinued on home folate
and iron.

# Acute kidney injury: Likely prerenal with creatinine elevated
to 1.5 from baseline of 1.0.  Continued gentle hydration and
improved to 1.1.
# ?RML opacity on CXR: CXR today shows consolidation in the
right lower lobe, which could be either atelectasis or
pneumonia. She did not become febrile or hemodynamically stable
so abx were not broadened.

# Hypertension: Held home atenolol and amlodipine given concern
hypotension in the setting of possible transient bacteremia from
percutaneous drain placement. Pt remained hemodynamically stable
but not hypertensive to warrant medications. When restarting
meds, consider change atenolol to metop as she is getting older
and has tenous kidney function as noted by acute kidney injury
from volume depletion on this admission

# AAA: 5.5 cm noted in [**2188**], per family do not want any
intervention given age and clinical status.

# GERD: Given history of gastrectomy for multiple gastric
ulcers, switched from h2 blocker to PPI. Started prilosec 40mg
daily.

# prevention: continue iron, folic acid, caltrate, robitussin

# depression: continue citalopram

# agitation: continue trazodone 50 mg qhs, hold PRN dose
.
# FEN: IVF bolus PRN, replete electrolytes, regular/low sodium
diet
# Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
