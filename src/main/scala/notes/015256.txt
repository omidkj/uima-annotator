Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:

removal of PICC line


History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 89 yo man s/p AAA repair [**4-21**] with a complicated post
op course including question of incarcerated hernia ([**5-15**]) s/p
SBR+hernia repair, ARF, Afib, UTI, C.diff, Achalsia, EGD [**5-13**],
hypernatremia, pneumonia, PICC TPN -> [**Month/Day (4) 282**] placement, [**5-22**]. Pt
was d/c'd to rehab [**5-26**] and subsequently transferred [**5-28**] to
[**Hospital3 417**] Hospital with fever to 101.8, where he was
diagnosed with a R PNA.  At OSH Pt transferred to ICU treated
with broad antibiotic coverage and neo for BP support. He was
then directly transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] SICU.

He was hemodynamically stable on arrival. He was emperically
covered with vanco/piptazo/flagyl (pt with hx of c.diff) . He
complained of abdominal pain and an I+ CT abdomen revealed: No
definite evidence of graft infection, Moderate right pleural
effusion and a distended gallbladder with multiple small stones
and a stable R inguinal hernia. Pt was transferred to the floor
on [**5-30**]. His INR was noted to be 5.1 at 5pm. His BP was 160/90
and his HR was >150 he was given 10mg IV lopressor. That night
at 10 pm he desatted to the 60's on 4L. Patient received 0.25 mg
IV Ativan at 9pm. Patient placed on a nonrebreather and 2mg
Flumazenil IV pushed and sats returned to the 90's, an ABG prior
to flumazenil was 7.36/215/33.  EKG was unchanged with no ST
changes. Stat labs were drawn and the HCT was found to be 25.6
from 31.5 at 5pm, 5 hours prior  and cTropnT was 0.2 from 0.06
on [**5-24**]. He was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs. His CK and CKMB
remained flat, his cTropT on [**5-31**] at 8am was 0.22 in the setting
of CR of 1.1.

Pertinent Results:
CXR - bilateral effusions, pulmonary edema

ECHO [**2189-6-3**]
The left and right atrium are markedly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function
may be more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with borderline normal systolic function. [Intrinsic right
ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] The aortic root and
ascending aorta are moderately dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are moderately thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**2-8**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. The end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is
increased suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 89 yo man s/p AAA repair and prolonged hospital course with
multiple complications from [**4-20**] to [**5-26**] recently tranferred
from OSH with fevers and hypotension.  His possible sources of
infection were felt to be his PICC, a pneumonia, his endograft,
C. difficile colitis, or urosepsis. The PICC line was removed
and the tip culture had no growth. He had multiple C.diff toxin
assasys that were negative.  He was seen by the vascular surgery
service and had an abdominal CT without evidence of graft
infection.  His urinalysis was not consistent with a UTI.  At an
outside hospital, there was a question of a lingular pneumonia;
however, his chest x-rays here revealed mainly evidence of
congestive heart failure wqith bilateral pleural effusions and
no obvious pneumonia.  On admission; however, he was started on
levofloxacin and metronidazole for possible pneumonia and his
fever disappeared for the remainder of his hospital course.

His congestive heart failure was difficult to control in the
setting of his atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response (HR in the 130's to 140's).  He had a repeat ECHO that
revealed normal LV systolic function with a mildly dilated RV,
[**2-8**]+ AR, 3+MR, and 3+TR.  He was slowly titrated up on
captopril, lopressor, and was diuresed with IV lasix.  He was
continued on coumadin for stroke risk reduction.  His severe
valvular dysfunction and diastolic/systolic heart failure made
diuresis extremely difficult.  After one week of attempted
diuresis, Mr. [**Known lastname 59190**] decided that he did not want any further
medical treatments except for those that would make him
comfortable.  His health care proxy, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1968**], was contact[**Name (NI) **]
and was in agreement with his decision.  He was treated with
morphine for his respiratory discomfort, and he died the
following day.  He was pronounced dead at 9:55 AM on [**2189-6-10**].
His health care proxy, his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] the
attending physician were all notified.
