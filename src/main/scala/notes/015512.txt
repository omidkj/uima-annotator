Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
recurrent stroke

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Pt. is a 65 year old with a hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, who is
transferred for further workup of multiple embolic strokes.

Pt. reports that he was driving on the highway on [**10-22**] when he
had acute onset of L arm numbness, weakness, and slurred speech.
He presented directly to [**Hospital3 10310**] ED, where he was found
to have a R frontoparietal stroke.  He was admitted, and
initially started on Heparin (reason unclear per available
records)  A Head CT was repeated in house and showed an area of
hemorrhage into the infarct, so Heparin was stopped, and no
further anti-platelets were given.  Carotid US was negative and
TTE was normal, EF 70%.  His weakness improved and he was
discharged home after 5 days.  On [**10-30**] he returned to the
hospital because when he woke up in the morning the arm weakness
was much worse, and his left leg was also affected.  His wife
was concerned because his strength was so much worse, but he did
not seem to realize it.  MRI was repeated and showed that there
was enlargement in the R frontoparietal infarct, and new small
acute
infarcts in the occipital lobes bilaterally (1.8 x 1.7 cm, and
1.6 x 1.5 cm respectively) as well as punctate infarcts in both
cerebellar infarcts.  Plan was to perform TEE to look for a
cardiac source for the infarcts, but this had not been
performed. He was treated with Unasyn for a low grade fever and
a ?
infiltrated in the R base.  He was evaluated by speech and
swallow and put on a diet of ground solids.  They list that on
exam on [**11-1**] he was able to answer questions but had L sided
weakness and neglect.

On ROS pt denies any visual problems, diplopia, blurry vision,
vision loss, headache, confusion, lethargy (wife feels that
besides the neglect he has been himself, not confused or
lethargic), dizziness, vertigo, dysphagia, SOB, CP, or bowel or
bladder changes.  He has had a cough productive of white phlegm.
 He still feels that his speech is slurred, and he that he has
the left sided weakness (says when he first went to the hospital
he could move the arm and leg, now he can't even squeeze)

but doesn't know it's name, says [**2190-10-30**] for date.  Attentive,
says [**Doctor Last Name 1841**] backwards.  Speech is fluent with normal comprehension
and repetition; naming intact when I point to body parts.
Cannot name pictures on card (doesn't focus gaze on them and
doesn't seem to see them, even when placed in R side of visual
field), or read a sentence.  Speech markedly slurred but
understandable with some effort.  Registers [**3-13**], recalls [**3-13**] in
5 minutes.  No right left confusion.  + L sided neglect.

Cranial Nerves:
Pupils equally round and reactive to light, 4 to 2 mm
bilaterally. L homonymous hemianopsia. Extraocular movements
intact bilaterally, no nystagmus.  Cannot visualize fundi.
Sensation intact V1- V3.  L UMN facial droop.  Hearing intact to
finger rub bilaterally.  Palate elevation symmetrical.
Sternocleidomastoid and trapezius normal bilaterally. Tongue
midline, movements intact

Motor:
Normal bulk bilaterally. Tone flaccid L arm. No observed
myoclonus or tremor.  Full strength throughout R arm and leg.
Flicker of movement LUE with nailbed pressure, flaccid.
Withdraws L leg minimally with pain, not anti-gravity.

Sensation: Cannot feel light touch in L hemibody. + extinction
to DSS on L.

Reflexes:
+2 and symmetric throughout R, brisker on L.
Toes downgoing R, upgoing L

Coordination: finger-nose-finger normal, heel to shin normal,
RAMs normal.

Imaging:
NCHCT: There is a significant cytotoxic edema and attenuation
involving the right frontal and parietal lobes with smaller
similar-appearing areas noted within the right and left
temporo-occipital regions bilaterally.  No significant mass
effect, shift of midline structures, or herniations identified.
No evidence of intraventricular hemorrhage with small region of
hyperdense material along the cortex of the right frontal lobe.
There is only minimal atherosclerotic disease noted within the
anterior  circulation in the carotid siphons bilaterally. There
may be a mild amount of hypoattenuation involving the cerebellar
hemispheres, although this region is difficult to evaluate on CT
examination due to beam hardening artifact.  Additional small
areas of hypoattenuation are noted within the right internal
capsule and caudate.  Soft tissues and osseous structures are
unremarkable.  Incidental note is made of no right- sided
frontal
sinus.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Large right MCA distribution infarct with bilateral PCA
distribution infarcts as noted on MRI.  Cerbellar infarcts are
difficult to appreciate on CT. No significant mass effect or
midline shift is identified.

Involvement of multiple vascular distributions is highly
concerning for embolic etiology.

2.  Small region of mild hyperdensity noted within the right
frontal lobe may represent cortical laminar necrosis or possibly
a small region of hemorrhagic conversion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. is a 65 year old with a hx of HTN and hyperlipidemia, who is
transferred for work up of multiple embolic appearing strokes.
On exam he is unable to see pictures on a card or read a
sentence, despite reporting that his vision is fine when I ask
him.  Given his bilateral occipital infarcts on OSH MRI this is
suggestive of [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name 9893**] syndrome.  He has L hemiparesis (L arm
flaccid, just a flicker of movement, flexes L leg and hip and
knee with pain but not antigravity) and L sided neglect.  He
seems also to have primary sensory loss in his L hemibody.  He
has a L homonymous hemianopsia.  All of these are likely
referable to his R frotoparietal infarct on MRI.  He also has
scattered punctate cerebellar infarcts, though he has no
dysmetria on exam.  The distribution of his infarcts is
concerning for a cardioembolic source (anterior and posterior, R
and L)  Given his low grade fever endocarditis is certainly a
concern (though also has a PNA and UTI on OSH labs that could
explain this)

1) Multiple embolic infarcts-
Admitted to Stroke Service. TEE to evaluate for cardiac source
for emboli. ASA 81, no Hep gtt for now given recent hemorrhage
into infarct. Blood cultures x 2 sets sent. Repeat CXR, UA.
Continued Levofloxacin, Flagyl for Rx PNA and UTI.

2) Marked clinical deterioration-
Clinically today had L sided dense hemiparesis, mild neglect and
visual field cut on L. During TEE received Fentanyl and Versed,
per nurses verbal report. Came back to floor, conversant with
with wife, no [**Name2 (NI) 75536**] distress.

He was moments later found unresponsive, no seizures witnessed
by sitter (from neighbouring patient), snoring deeply and
regularly with occasional pauzes.
