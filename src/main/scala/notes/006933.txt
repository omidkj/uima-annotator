History of Present Illness:
HPI: 48 yo male with h/o emphysema, COPD, extensive cigarette
smoking history admitted to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital on [**1-2**] with dx of
Strep mitis bacteremia [**12-21**] poor dentition (negative TTE) and
Candidemia (?source) treated with 4 weeks of IV
Vanco/Fluconazole and discharged on [**1-31**].  The pt was discharged
to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab and developed new fevers on [**2-3**], sent back to
[**Hospital1 882**] where CT abdomen revealed a possible necrotizing PNA
(apparently a CT chest was not done), with edema of GB with
negative US.  He was started on levo/flagyl and sent back to
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab.  He was seen at [**Hospital1 882**] earlier on the day of
admission, with c/o fevers, intermittent headaches, bitemporal X
2-3 weeks with nausea after eating eggs this morning.  His temp
was 100.1 satting 98% on 3L NC at [**Hospital1 882**], other VSS.  ID was
consulted, and recommended on transfer: For necrotizing pna-
consider TB, cryptococcus, aspergillosis, PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] rec adding
Vanco for MRSA PNA. Flagyl and levo were continued.
.
In the ED, the pt states that his headaches not otherwise assoc
with nausea.  Admits to some photophobia.  No nuchal rigidity.
C/o tenderness over right chest wall and right iliac crest for
several months.  Also noted diarrhea X 3 days, brown watery no
blood or mucus.  No rashes, joint pain, abd pain.  No new back
pain.  No penile discharge, dyuria, hematuria, no new sexual

In [**Name (NI) **], pt was put in isolation for rule out TB.  Blood cx x 4,
blood cryptococcal ag sent, UA (negative), urine cx, and
[**Name (NI) **] urine ag sent.  CXR revealed a RLL PNA with a Right
hilar mass.  CT of the chest was ordered, and a ddimer was found
to be 2934.

ADMISSION to [**Hospital1 882**] [**2159-2-4**] IMAGING:
[**2-4**] CXR RLL infiltrate
[**2159-2-5**] ABD US: normal except for a 1.8cm cystic lesion in the
lower pole of the right kidney.
[**2159-2-6**]: CT ABD/PEL small right lower lobe pleural effusion;
possible necrotizing PNA; septated cyst in the lower pole of the
right kidney which does not appear to be an abscess
(recommendation to repeat son[**Name (NI) 493**] imaging in 6 months);
edema of gallbladder wall
.
[**Hospital1 18**] Labs: see below
[**2159-2-9**]: blood cx x2 pending
[**2159-2-9**]: serum Cryptococcal ag negative
[**2159-2-9**]: urine cx pending
[**2159-2-9**]: urine [**Month/Day/Year 14616**] ag sent and pending
.
[**2159-2-9**]: CXR IMPRESSION:
1. Abnormal opacity in the right hilum with patchy consolidation
in the right lower lobe. Findings are consistent with right
lower lobe pneumonia. This may be due to a right hilar mass and
could be further evaluated with chest CT. PE cannot be excluded.

2. No evidence of CHF.
3. Emphysema involving the upper lobes.
.
[**2159-2-9**]: CT chest IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive consolidation in right lower lobe with underlying
emphysema, representing lobar pneumonia.
2. Patchy opacities in left upper lobe, with somewhat nodular
appearance measuring up to 9 mm as described above, which can be
related to infectious process; however, followup is recommended.

3. Extensive centrilobular emphysema.
4. Right pleural effusion.
5. A 1.1 cm right hilar node. No other mediastinal or hilar
mass.

[**2-26**] CXR:
A right PICC line and tracheostomy tube remain in satisfactory
position. Heart size is normal. Subtle bilateral infrahilar
opacities are present, not significantly changed allowing for
differences in technique dating back to [**2159-2-23**]. Severe
upper lobe emphysema is noted.

IMPRESSION: Subtle bilateral infrahilar opacities, likely due to
a slowly resolving infection. Severe emphysema.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 48 yo male with h/o emphysema, COPD, presents with h/o non
productive cough, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, diarrhea.
.
1.  RLL PNA:  This was thought to be likely community acquired
PNA vs. MRSA PNA vs. aspiration PNA.  There were possible
necrotizing features seen on OSH CT, not appreciated on CT here,
however PNA is consolidated, lobar RLL.  Sputum cultures were
sent for bacterial, fungal, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 14616**], AFB cultures.  A
cryptococcal antigen was sent and returned negative.  The
patient was initially maintained on TB precautions until he
ruled out w/ 3 sputum samples and a negative PPD.  He was taken
for bronchoscopy, and subsequently required intubation as
copious pus was found in the bronchioles and his airway was
compromised.  He was then transferred to the MICU for vent
weaning.  Cultures from the bronch grew MSRA, and the patient
was placed on Vanc
