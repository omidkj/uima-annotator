.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple with
JVP of 7 cm. The carotid waveform was normal. There was no
thyromegaly. The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis. The respirations were not labored and there were no
use of accessory muscles. The lungs were clear to ascultation
bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds
or rubs.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The heart sounds revealed a normal
S1 and the S2 was normal. There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or
gallops.
.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis,
clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid
bruits. Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous
tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

Operative Report:
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Pulmonary hypertension on continuous
Flolan drip with need for long-term central venous access.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Pulmonary hypertension on continuous
Flolan drip with need for long-term central venous access.

NAME OF PROCEDURE:  Placement of 9.6-French single-lumen
Hickman catheter via left subclavian vein with fluoroscopy.

ASSISTANT:  None

ANESTHESIA:  MAC with local.

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 49-year-old lady
with a history of pulmonary artery hypertension who has been
on a Flolan drip through a central venous catheter since
[**Month (only) 1096**]
of last year. She had an indwelling single-lumen [**Last Name (un) **]
catheter in place but was admitted several days ago with a line
infection with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Micrococcus
species. The line was removed on [**4-25**] and she has been
receiving intravenous vancomycin via a PICC line in the interim.
She presents now for placement of a new tunneled line for the
long-term administration of Flolan. The Flolan drip was to be
continued throughout this operation via an indwelling PICC
line in the right arm. The risks and benefits of this procedure
were discussed with the patient and the consent signed.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was
identified in the preoperative holding area and taken to the
operating room where she was positioned supine on the operating
room table with her arms tucked at her side. After the
adequate induction of monitored anesthesia, her bilateral
upper chest and lower neck were sterilely prepped and draped
in the usual fashion. A timeout was performed identifying the
patient and the procedure to be performed. Intravenous
vancomycin had been administered in the ICU. The left
infraclavicular space was anesthetized with a 1:1 mixture of
1% lidocaine with epinephrine and 0.5% Marcaine plain.
With the patient placed in the Trendelenburg position, the
left subclavian vein was easily accessed on first pass with a
needle. A wire was placed centrally by Seldinger technique
and confirmed to be in the central circulation by
intraoperative fluoroscopy. Additional local anesthetic was
infiltrated upon the planned path of tunneling along the left
chest wall. An incision was made contiguous with the wire
exit site and a counter incision made more inferiorly on the
left chest wall. A 9.6-French single-lumen Hickman catheter
was then secured to a tunneling device and was then advanced
through the tunnel, positioning the cuff in the mid-portion
of the tunnel. The catheter was then cut to an appropriate
length. A dilator peel-away sheath assembly was advanced over
the wire and into the left subclavian vein without resistance.
The dilator and wire were removed together with venous
backbleeding from the sheath. The catheter was advanced through
the sheath which was in turn removed. The tip of the catheter
was
located in the proximal right atrium by intraoperative
fluoroscopy. The catheter was secured at the skin exit site with
a single 2-0 Prolene suture. The catheter easily aspirated
venous
blood and was flushed with dilute heparinized saline and then
with heparinized saline 100 units per mL. Sterile dressings were
applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
complications. She was transferred back to the intensive care
unit in good condition.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Bacteremia: Most likely source is permanent Flolan catheter
which was removed. Blood cultures from [**2155-4-23**] showed 2/2 bottles
with gram positive cocci, probable micrococcus spp. She was
started on Vancomycin empirically and monitored with daily
serial blood cultures, all negative since initial antibiotic
therapy.  Once blood cultures were negative for 2 consecutive
and surgery successfully placed a new Hickman catheter for
Flolan administration.  Patient remained afebrile and had a
successful PICC placement for the remainder of her Vancomycin
therapy.
.
# Pulmonary artery hypertension: Likely secondary to lupus.
Patient was maintained on Flolan infusion through peripheral IV
until central access was obtained.  She was also continued on
prednisone.  She was maintained on heparin anticoagulation while
in house for her pulmonary artery hypertension and
anti-phospholipid antibodies, and outpatient warfarin was held
due to procedures.  Patient had a successful Hickman c
