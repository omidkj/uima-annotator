Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 yo F BIBA w/ history of diastolic CHF (nl
LVEF), atrial flutter on coumadin, DM, hypertension, obesity,
pulmonary hypertension, OSA on BiPap at night and 3L O2 during
day who presents with tachypnea and abdominal distention x 3
weeks.  Today, visiting nurse noted extreme work of breathing
and tachypnea.  The patient denies feeling any increased
shortness of breath; she feels she is at her baseline.  She
notes that when she sees a new VNA they are always concerned by
her breathing.  She does however note that over the past week
she has increased abdominal girth and "heaviness"  She denies
any associated abdominal symptoms including pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.  She has taken less PO over
the past week - for unclear reasons.  She has been compliant
with medications until this AM due to increased dyspnea.  She
denies any fevers, chills, chest pain, palpitations, abdominal
pain or nausea.  She has extensive bilateral lower extremity
edema, however this is reportedly at her baseline.  Aside from
abdominal heaviness, she has no complaints.

Of note, according to the patient's daughter, she is an extreme
underreporter.  At baseline she is not very active leaving the
house only 2-3 times per month.  She uses 4L oxygen with
ambulation and 2L oxygen at rest.  She reports feeling very
short of breath even with minimal exertion.  She had an
admission in [**2166**] for similar symptoms.

On arrival to the ED the patient's vital signs were HR irregular
180s, BP 151/104s, RR 40s, and no O2 sat as they were unable to
get a pleth.  She was given Lopressor 5mg x 1 with resultant
improvement in HR to 130s and drop in blood pressure to 102/56.
She received 2L NS in ED with some improvement in BP.  She was
given solumedrol 125mg x1 and Diltiazem 5mg IV tried with good
HR result but again low BP.  ABG 7.26/59/191.  CXR with patchy
opacities.  KUB also done which was poor study [**12-25**] habitus.  Abd
exam benign.  She was started on Bipap and admitted to MICU for
monitoring.


Past Medical History:

Atrial flutter (chronic), on warfarin, amiodarone
OSA, on Bipap ([**10-29**] with 4 LPM)

History of hematuria, fibroids, DJD
History of breast fibroadenoma

TAHBSO [**2137**] for fibroids

Social History:
Retired, former maid, lives with 20 year old granddaughter in
[**Name (NI) 86**]. Drinks occasionally, no history of smoking or ilicit
drugs. Mrs. [**Known lastname **] does not have any trouble affording her
medications and has them mailed to her in punch-bubble calendar
sheets.  Insurance through MassHealth.


Family History:
Father had MI age 77. No DM or cancers

Physical Exam:
VS T96.7, P118, BP 112/84, RR 33, O2Sat 92% on Bipap 14/6, 8L
O2.
GENERAL: Obese, anxious appearing female.  Tachypneic.  Nasal
mask in place.
HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI without nystagmus, no scleral icterus
noted, dry MM, no lesions noted in OP
Neck: supple, difficult to assess JVP due to habitus.
Pulmonary: Diffuse expiratory wheezing noted, decreased breath
sounds at bilateral bases.
Cardiac: Tachy, irregular, nl. S1S2, 2/6 systolic ejection
murmur heard best at LUSB.
Abdomen: Obese, soft, NT, + distention, decreased bowel sounds,
no masses or organomegaly noted.
Extremities: 2+ edema to thigh bilaterally, no c/c.  dopplerable
DP pulses b/l.
Neurologic:
-mental status: Alert, oriented x 3. Anxious, asking why she is
here.
-cranial nerves: II-XII intact
-motor: normal bulk, strength and tone throughout. No abnormal
movements noted.
-sensory: No deficits to light touch throughout.


Pertinent Results:
[**8-15**] CXR: Limited single bedside AP view labeled "upright in EU"
patient lordotically positioned, as compared with most recent
study dated [**2168-3-30**], more remote study dated [**2167-3-8**], and CT of
the chest dated [**2166-9-18**].  The study is quite limited by, among
other things, the patient's habitus.  However, again
demonstrated are multifocal patchy airspace opacities, likely
unchanged since the most recent and the [**2166**] study, but largely
new since the [**8-26**] CT.  These may, therefore, represent chronic
consolidations of unknown etiology.  There is evidence of left
ventricular, left atrial and central pulmonary arterial
enlargement, with no definite pulmonary vascular engorgement.
There is hazy opacity involving both CP angles, and small
effusions are possible.

[**2168-8-16**] Abd U/S - Limited study as stated without obvious
hepatic abnormality. No free fluid identified.

[**2168-8-16**] CXR -  In comparison with the study of [**8-15**], there is
little overall change. Again, there are scattered areas of
patchy air space opacification, unchanged since the 20/06 study
that may therefore represent some chronic changes of unknown
etiology. Generalized enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is
seen with mild vascular engorgement. Haziness of the
costophrenic angles raises the possibility of small effusions.

[**2168-8-19**] CXR -  Extremely limited examination. No significant
interval change.

[**2168-8-20**] CXR -  Limited study secondary to patient positioning.
New placement of a left internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter. The
Swan-Ganz catheter tip is in the right lobar or segmental
pulmonary artery. No pneumothorax identified.

[**2168-8-21**] CXR -  The endotracheal tube tip is at the level of the
aortic knob. There is a left-sided Swan-Ganz catheter with the
distal lead tip in the right pulmonary artery. There is a
right-sided IJ catheter with distal lead tip in the proximal
SVC, unchanged. There is again seen cardiomegaly which is
stable. There are airspace opacities within both lung bases,
stable. Pulmonary vascular congestion is again seen and is also
unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 71 yo F with diastolic dysfunction, DM, HTN
admitted with shock and respiratory failure.

Respiratory failure. Likely a large component of diastolic
dysfunction with elevated right heart pressures +/- obesity
hypoventilation +/- PNA. The patient was intubated due to
respiratory failure. She received antibiotic therapy for an
acinetobacter pneumonia (grown in the sputum). She underwent
aggressive cardiac monitoring including Swan-Ganz
catheterization after echocardiogram revealed a dilated RV.
Despite these measures, the patient was ventilator dependent.
After approximately 2 weeks on the ventilator, the patient was
terminally extubated in accordance with the family's wishes and
in accordance with the patient's prior statements of not wanting
prolonged life support. She passed within minutes of extubation
on [**2168-8-31**] at 1:35PM due to respiratory failure. The family
declined an autopsy.
