Admission Date:  [**2101-8-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2101-8-20**]

Date of Birth:   [**2039-8-28**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital1 **] Medicine, [**Hospital Ward Name 517**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypoglycemia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61 year old woman with
a history of hypoglycemic episodes in the past of unknown
etiology and she was found unresponsive at home by her
family.  Emergency medical technician notes indicate a
fingerstick glucose in the field of 28.  The patient was
given 1 amp of D10 in the field with some improvement in her
mental status.  The patient arrived in the Emergency
Department and was hypotensive with a systolic [**Hospital Ward Name **] pressure
of 74 and fingerstick going as low as 47.  The patient
required Dopamine drip to maintain a [**Hospital Ward Name **] pressure despite
repeated normal saline boluses, necessitating a Medicine
Intensive Care Unit admission on [**2101-8-13**].  On
arrival to the floor the patient had been off of pressors for
24 hours.  The patient had been transferred to the floor on
[**8-16**] and the patient had received a hemodialysis
session on [**8-15**].  The patient also had been on four
days of Vancomycin upon transfer to the floor.  This was for
one out of four bottles of gram positive cocci which were
subsequently believed to be contaminate.  Upon transfer to
the floor, the patient's fingersticks over night ranged from
85 to 150.  Upon transfer the patient denied any pain, nausea
or shortness of breath.  She started to report poor appetite
secondary to "bad cooking" of the hospital cafeteria.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for upper gastrointestinal
bleed secondary to esophagitis as well as gastritis in [**2101-5-31**].  The patient has been on end stage renal disease since
approximately seven years ago and has a history of Type 2
diabetes, going back 20 to 30 years and is status post
adenoma resection approximately 13 years ago with resulting
panhypopituitarism and is currently on Prednisone at the
current dose of 10 mg daily as well as Synthroid dependent.
History of hypertension.  History of congestive heart
failure.  Ejection fraction less than 20%.  History of
coronary artery disease.  History of gastroesophageal reflux
disease.  History of secondary arteriovenous block, Type 1.
History of hemosiderosis and history of recurrent
hypoglycemics noted above.  Also status post ovarian mass
resection in [**2087**].

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:  Prednisone, outpatient dose 5 mg
daily; Colace 100 mg b.i.d.; Folate 1 mg daily; Synthroid 75
mcg daily; Thiamine 100 mg daily; Lisinopril 5 mg daily;
Epogen given with each for hemodialysis session.

On transfer to the floor her medications were Vancomycin 1 gm
intravenously q. day Day #4, Protonix 40 mg intravenously
daily, Synthroid 75 mcg daily, Prednisone 10 mg daily and
..................2 to 4 mg intravenously q. 8 hours prn
nausea.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was living with her sister and
has no known drug, tobacco or ethyl alcohol history.  She has
no children and is separated.  She is a retired packer for
[**Company 22916**] Razor Company.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Pertinent for diabetes in her mother.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As noted above the one out of four bottle
turned out to be a most likely contaminate.  The patient
remained afebrile without any evidence of leukocytosis.  The
Vancomycin was subsequently discontinued.  Her hemodialysis
was continued for end stage renal disease, continuing
sessions of Monday, Wednesday, and Friday hemodialysis
sessions.  In terms of her hypoglycemia in consultation with
the underconservative, the decision was of an insulinoma,
therefore after her dialysis session on [**8-17**], the
patient was put on an overnight fast with the only p.o.
permitted to be her medications, water and diet soda.
Fingersticks were checked q. 6 hours during this episode and
then when her fingersticks fell below 60 q. 1 hour
fingersticks were checked with a goal being less than 45.  On
the morning of [**8-18**], the fingerstick was 42 and the
following protocol was initiated - Given her lack of
peripheral intravenous access, all [**Month (only) **] draws to this point
were done by arterial sticks in the left radial artery, the
right arm being off limits as her hemodialysis port was cited
in that arm.  Initial arterial stick was drawn, being divided
to be sent off for a serum glucose with additional tubes sent
off in the Tiger top tube for analysis for termination of
total insulin, pro-insulin, C-peptide and Beta hydroxy
butyrate levels.  After this [**Month (only) **] sample was obtained, the
patient was given intravenous injection peripherally of 1 mg
of Glucagon and, then at set time points after the
administration of Glucagon, repeat arterial sticks were done
to determine the serum glucose.  The initial plan was for
[**Month (only) **] to be drawn at 10, 20 and 30 minutes after the
administration of Glucagon, however, given her terribly poor
access, the actual timepoints obtained were at 15 minutes
after the administration of Glucagon and then at 45 minutes
after the administration of Glucagon.  The final results of
this study are still pending as of this dictation.  The
patient's course was also notable for thrombocytopenia during
her time in the Intensive Care Unit, of note when the patient
was not intubated, she had a HITT antibody which was sent out
and report indicated as negative.  The etiology of her
thrombocytopenia is unknown but it was checked daily and was
found to be stable.  In terms of her panhypopituitarism she
was continued on her dose of Synthroid 75 mcg daily and dose
of 10 mg of Prednisone p.o. daily.  In terms of her
gastroesophageal reflux disease, she was continued on
Protonix 40 p.o. q. day.  In terms of her diet she was
continued on a diabetic house diet with t.i.d. Nutrashakes
with snacks in between as per nutritional recommendations for
episodes of hypoglycemia.  In terms of her prophylaxis she
was continued on pneuma boots when in bed.  Given her low
platelet counts subcutaneous heparin was avoided.

CODE STATUS:  Her code status at this time remained
questionable.  The patient herself refused to discuss the
issue and discussion with her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**First Name (STitle) 1022**], revealed that he had met with similar result when he
discussed this issue with the patient in the past.  The
patient said refer such discussions to her sister.  A family
meeting was therefore finally called on [**8-19**].
Present were the attending, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1022**] as well as Case
Management and the patient's family.  The patient was
agreeable at that point to send the patient to rehabilitation
with planned date of discharge to rehabilitation on [**2101-8-20**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Prednisone 10 mg p.o. daily
2.  Protonix 40 p.o. q. day
3.  Synthroid 75 mg p.o. q. day
4.  Vitamin D 400 units p.o. q. day
5.  Daily multivitamin
6.  Senna prn

FOLLOW UP:  The patient will have follow up set up with her
primary care physician in one to two weeks prior to discharge
to rehabilitation.
