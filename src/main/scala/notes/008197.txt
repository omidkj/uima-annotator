CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2124-12-24**] 12:27 AM
Comparison is made to [**2124-10-30**]. There are new airspace
opacities involving both lungs with predominance at the lower
lungs with air bronchograms, consistent with multifocal
pneumonia. Less likely this may represent edema as there is also
increased perihilar vasculature.
.
CHEST XR on [**2125-1-6**] The endotracheal tube in the left-sided
central venous catheter are unchanged in position. There is
again seen marked prominence of the pulmonary interstitial
markings without focal areas of consolidation. Overall the
findings are stable.

[**2125-1-1**] ECHO: Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2124-12-25**], the right  ventricle is now dilated and hypokinetic.
Left ventricular systolic function  appears similar to prior.
.
[**2125-1-1**] CTA
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Evidence of severe diffuse interstitial pneumonitis, greater
in the lower than upper lobes. The appearance is most suggestive
of acute interstitial pneumonitis or drug-related pneumonitis,
and already shows fibrotic change.
3. Stable dilatation of the aortic root to 48 mm.
4. Mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
5. Questionable sludge within the gallbladder.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo M [**Country 3587**] speaking only w/HTN, DM, Hyperlipidemia, T-Ao
aneurysm w/moderate AR, p/w productive cough and SOB, likely
pneumonia and CHF exacerbation, with  question SVT with
abberancy. His hospital course by problem is as follows:
.
Hypoxia: Family reports one week of cough, without fever chills,
productive of white sputum. In ED, febrile with CXR consistent
with multifocal pneumonia. Presumed infection leading at least
in part to SOB. Initially started on Levofloxacin in house for
likely community aquired pneumonia. Then during hospital course,
pt became acutely more hypoxic, a trigger was called for sats in
83-87% on 5L NC, and patient was transferred to ICU for closer
monitoring. At that time Abx coverage was broadned to
Vanc/Zosyn. In the ICU, he was not intubated immediately and for
the first day seemed to be tolerating face mask; however, he was
RR 30's and unable to wean off oxygen. Then after 2 days in
MICU, pt had decline of resp status, increased RR to 30's, not
oxygenating well despite non-invasive ventilation 7.53/35/61,
and he was intubated. CXR at the time showed worsening bilateral
interstitial dx concerning for ARDS. CTA negative for PE. Over
the remainder of his hosp course, his resp status continued to
decline. BAL grew nothing. Sputum grew MRSA and GNR, and he
continued broad spectrum abx.
.
Hypotension: During the ICU course pt became increasingly
hypotensive, all BP meds were discontinued, and he was started
on neosynephrine. Initially there was concern for overdiuresis;
however, BP did not return after fluids. CVP remained between
[**7-8**]. His pressures were noted to be very PEEP dependent.
Ultimately, he was felt to have septic physiology. He continued
broad spectrum Abx, neosynephrine, fluids as needed and CVP
stayed withi
