History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 61 yo M with PMHx sig. for squamous cell carcinoma
of the tongue with mets to lung, ribs, and hips who was
transferred from [**Hospital1 882**] ED for hypoxia. He recently moved to
Roscommon on the Parkway. During his initial intake, he was
found to be PPD+. He was seen at [**Hospital1 86761**] [**Hospital **] clinic and was felt
not to have active TB but perhaps a community acquired pneumonia
on CXR. He just finished a 10 day course of levaquin for
pneumonia. He recently has loose stools, was found to have C.
diff on [**3-10**], and was started on Flagyl. At rehab, he became
acutely SOB with spO2 to 38%, RR20, HR 122, BP 86/60, and
T100.5. Per NH, his baseline A&Ox2. He has poor appetite and
refuses most meals.
.
He was taken to [**Hospital1 882**]. BCxs were drawn and he received Vanc
and Zosyn for presumed pneumonia. Labs were sig. for WBC 5.1,
30% bands, 45% N, 14% L, Cr 1.9, Ca 15.9, CK 47, TropT 0.08, BNP
4936. ABG was 7.53/35/57 on NRB. He was placed on BiPap 13/8
with ABG of 7.49/34/326. He was transferred him for ICU care.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T98.6, P87, BP 94/65, R 22, and O2
sat 93% on 4L. He was briefly hypotensive to SBP of 70s,
responded to IVF bolus. Labs were sig. for WBC of 4.6, 6%bands,
Cr 2.0, Ca 13.4. CT head showed "lytic bone lesions in left
occiput and right frontal [**Location (un) **] likely represent lytic mets.
Pending reformations, but no obvious intracranial extension. No
acute intracranial process." CXR showed Patient was started on
heparin gtt and he was given azithromycin. He has received a
total of 2L NS.
.
Review of sytems: Difficult to obtain due to dysarthria. Denied
any headache, chest pain. His SOB was improved. He had lower
abdominal pain and diarrhea.

CT Head:
IMPRESSION:
1. Right frontal and left basilar occiput lytic metastatic
lesions without
intra-articular extension.
2. Bilateral thalamic hypoattenuation may represent lacunar
infarcts;
however, metastases are not excluded. If the clinical concern
exists, then an
MR is recommended for further evaluation.
.
CXR:
IMPRESSION:

Right extrapulmonary mass, likely pleural-based. A chest CT may
be acquired
for further evaluation.

LENIs: No DVT

CT NECK
1. Patent airway with endotracheal tube in place. Minimal soft
tissue
thickening at the level of cricoid and thyroid cartilage likely
represents
vocal cords, although further evaluation in this region is
limited due to
presence of the tube. A small area of ill-defined density
anterior to the
endotracheal tube just below the level of vocal cord (301B, 70)
may represent synechia or scar tissue or secretion.

2. Left cervical soft tissue thickening with adjacent fat
stranding may
represent post-surgical and radiation therapy change in this
region. Partial
strap muscle resection and submental surgical clips evident on
the left.

3. Partial visualization of a large right chest wall mass
extending into
right lung with multifocal osseous metastasis.

4. Multilevel degenerative disease in the cervical spine,
concurrent
metastasis cannot be excluded.

5. Subcentimeter left thyroid nodule may be further evaluated by
ultrasound
on non-emergent basis as clinically indicated.

6. Partially visualized endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and
left
approach central venous catheter appear to be in expected
locations.


Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course by problem:

Respiratory Failure secondary to difficulty protecting airway
from oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma: Intially treated for
pneumonia and ruled out for PE. Echo was also performed as well
which showed normal systolic funct
