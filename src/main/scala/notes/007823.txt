Chief Complaint:
"pneumonia"


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-[**2178-8-21**] bronchoscopy with biopsy
-[**2178-8-19**] pericardial window, chest tube placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 28003**] is a 62 year old female with a history of limited
scleroderma/CREST and recurrent pneumonia who was admitted for
suspected pneumonia.  She has been having persistent symptoms
since summer [**2177**] when she was diagnosed with a pneumonia and
completed a course of cefpodoxime/azithromycin.
.
During the week PTA, the patient had progressively worsening
cough, shortness of breath and fever.  Her fever curve hit
maximum at 101.9.  She wasn't able to perform her usual daily
functions at home due to profound fatigue and decided to go to
[**Location (un) 620**] for further evaluation.  On [**8-14**], the patient had a
chest x-ray which showed a left lower lobe pneumonia with
progression and worsening. She does report that over the past
months it has gotten progressively more difficult for her to
swallow.
.
In the ED, initial vitals 99.5 86 113/64 18 98% ra.  She had a
CXR concerning for pna and was given cefepime.  They encouraged
her to accept admission to the hospital.
.
Currently, she is resting in bed but having ongoing cough and
shortness of breath.

PATHOLOGY:
-[**8-19**] pericardium tissue: Organizing pericarditis. There is no
evidence of malignancy in this sample.
-[**8-19**] left pleural cell block: Positive for malignant cells,
consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma; see note. Note: By
immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells are positive for CK7,
TTF-1, [**Last Name (un) **]-31, CEA (absorbed), and B72.3, and are negative for
LeuM1 (CD15), calretinin, and WTI, with adequate controls. The
findings are non-specific, but are compatible with a tumor of
lung origin. Correlation with clinical and radiographic findings
is recommended.
-[**8-20**] Lymph node FNA's combined: POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,
consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.

DIAGNOSIS:
Pleural fluid, cell block:
Metastatic adenocarcinoma.
.
IMAGING:
.
- [**8-15**] CXR: There has been progression of left-sided multifocal
pneumonia, with dense consolidation in the left perihilar
region, superior
segment of the left lower lobe, and lateral basal segment of the
left lower lobe. Partial obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm
is noted. There are no significant pleural effusions or
pneumothorax. Marked lymphadenopathy persists in the bilateral
hilar regions, left greater than right; as well as in the
subcarinal region, with splaying of the left and right main
bronchi.  The heart is normal in size. Pleural parenchymal
scarring persists at the lung apices, particularly in the
lateral right upper lobe. Multilevel degenerative changes are
noted in the thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION: Worsening multifocal left-sided pneumonia, with
associated
intrathoracic lymphadenopathy. Recommend close clinical and
imaging followup as an underlying malignancy is not excluded.
Consider pulmonary consultation.
.
[**8-16**] CT CHEST: IMPRESSION:
1. Since [**2178-7-6**], the left lower lobe consolidation has
significantly
progressed with unchanged bulk of the bilateral hilar and
mediastinal lymph
nodes. Interlobular interstitial septal thickening in left lower
lobe
persists.
2. Interval appearance of mild to moderate simple left pleural
effusion and
mild-to-moderate pericardial effusion without any element of
pericardial
tamponade.
Above CT features are worrisome for lung malignancy. Bulky
subcarinal lymph
