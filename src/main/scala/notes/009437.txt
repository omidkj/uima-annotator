Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Abnormal ETT, worsening shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Trach and Peg [**2153-1-24**]
[**2153-1-6**] Urgent Three Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
utilizing the left internal mammary artery to left anterior

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 72F with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and
COPD. She was seen in cardiac consultation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8098**] on
[**10-14**] for complaints of shortness of breath. She underwent an
echocardiogram which revealed segmental wall abnormalities. She
then underwent a nuclear stress test which was limited by
functional capacity and shortness of breath. Nuclear images did
reveal multiple perfusion defects involving  the anterior wall,
apex and part of the inferior wall.  Pt reports developing
increasing DOE over past year, reports she is able to walk one
block and climb one flight of stairs "slowly" but without
stopping. Can carry her groceries. Denies ever having
experienced any chest discomfort. Otherwise on ROS: Denies
orthopnea, LE edema. No HA, vision changes, dysphagia,
palpitations, heart burn, abd pain, n/v/d/c, musculoskeletal
pain. She has been worked up extensively by pulmonary and found
to have COPD. Apparently she has never smoked but worked for
thirty years in a factory with exposure to fiberglass on a daily
basis. She was started on multiple inhalers and was doing well
until this past fall when she developed a cold. She was given
antibiotics and steroids which resolved her cold but she noticed
that since that time she develops shortness of breath with
exertion. She reports the episodes are inconsistent, some days
she can walk the length of the grocery store without difficulty
but other days she develops shortness of breath after one block.
She denies chest discomfort, dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea,
near syncope, or syncope.

[**2153-1-4**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
severe three vessel disease.  There was a 70-80% stenosis of the
distal
LMCA.  The LAD was totally occluded in the mid-vessel and filled

distally via left-left and right-left collaterals.  The LCx had
a 40%
proximal lesion.  The RCA had a 80% proximal stenosis and a 70%
ostial
stenosis of the PDA branch.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated right and
left heart
filling pressures with a mean RA of 30mmHg and mean PCWP of
43mmHg.  The
PASP was markedly elevated at 90-100mmHg.  The cardiac index was

depressed at 1.9l/min/m2.
3.  A 30cc IABP was successfully placed via the right femoral
artery,
with improvement of the cardiac index to 2.6l/min/m2.
4. Left ventriculography was deferred.
[**2153-1-4**] Echocardiogram:
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with anteroseptal and anterior hypokinesis (proximal
LAD distribution). The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 40%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with normal free wall contractility. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2153-1-4**] Carotid Ultrasound:
There is 60-69% stenosis in the left and right internal carotid
arteries.
[**2153-1-7**] Transesophogeal Echocardiogram:
Small pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of
tamponade physiology. Mild left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Mild mitral and aortic regurgitation. Patent
foramen ovale with left-to-right shunting.
[**2153-1-7**] Renal Ultrasound:
1. No hydronephrosis. Left renal cysts. 2. Both kidneys
demonstrate blood flow though more precise evaluation of the
arterial waveforms was limited.
[**2153-1-10**] Transthoracic Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened, but without discrete
vegetation. Mild to moderate ([**12-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid regurgitation jet is eccentric and may be
underest
