Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Librium / Aureomycin / Codeine / Benzocaine

Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1857**]
Chief Complaint:
Increasing angina with exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with bare metal stenting of the right
coronary artery

History of Present Illness:
85 yo man with H/O angina, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CKD
(baseline Cr 1.7-2.1), CAD s/p NSTEMI (s/p rotational
atherectomy RCA [**2173**], [**Year (4 digits) **] PCI [**2174**], [**Name (NI) 11919**] PTCA and proximal RCA
PCI [**2179**]) moderate-severe mitral regurgitation, who presented
with one week of intermittent chest pain. Per patient report,
the first episode occurred on Saturday, described as Left
shoulder pain into his back, [**5-20**], nonexertional, but associated
with mild diaphoresis; no shortness of breath, palpitations, or
nausea. Pain lasted less than 20 minutes and resolved with SLNTG
x1. Since then, he reportedly had mildly elevated BPs at home,
intermittent similar episodes of chest pain (about 1 episode per
day) each responding well to SLNTG. On Thursday, patient reports
he was using his lawn mower when had increased pain, more than
previously, feeling more similar to prior anginal pain,
resolving after 2 SLNTG. He called his cardiologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2201**], who felt the patient should be directly admitted for
cardiac catheterization after receiving pre-procedure hydration
overnight on the [**Hospital1 1516**] service.

On the day of transfer to the CCU, patient underwent cardiac
catheterization which showed 3-vessel disease, severe left
ventricular diastolic failure with moderately elevated wedge
with prominent V waves consistent with significant mitral
regurgitation. Patient was found to have significant RCA
disease. A bare metal stent was placed in the proximal RCA
complicated by wire induced dissection in the RCA managed with
two additional BMS. This was further complicated by plaque shift
and embolization into a major RV branch with transient inferior
ST elevation, nausea, heaves, bradycardia, and chest pain. He
was given atropine, which resolved the bradycardia. Patient
reports he continued to have retrosternal chest pain after the
procedure that lasted 20 minutes.

Currently on the floor, patient denies any chest pain, shortness
of breath, lightheadedness, nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis,
orthopnea, PND.

Sinus bradycardia. Left ventricular hypertrophy. QS deflection
in lead V1 and Q wave in lead V2 with delayed R wave transition
consistent with prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction. These
findings are new as compared with previous tracing of [**2187-11-26**].
Followup and clinical correlation are suggested.

Cardiac catheterization [**8-13**]
  1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel disease. The LMCA was short and had no
angiographcally apparent disease. The LAD had proximal diffuse
disease to 40% just before D1. There was diffuse plaquing in D1
to 45% proximally. The mid LAD drug-eluting stents began just
after D1 and extended past the jailed D2 and contained mild
in-stent restenosis to 30%; the jailed D2 had an origin 60%
lesion. The distal LAD wrapped around the apex. The [**Month/Year (2) 8714**] had a
near-ostial bifurcation lesion involving the high OM1 to 65% in
the [**Month/Year (2) **] and 70% at the origin of OM1; OM1 itself had diffuse
disease to 65%. OM2 had diffuse disease to 50% proximally. The
[**Month/Year (2) 8714**] also supplied patent OM3/LPL1 and a modest LPL2. The RCA had
a patent near-ostial stent. There was a proximal 70% just beyond
the proximal RCA stent with diffuse disease thereafter down past
the major AM; the AM had an origin 70% stenosis with TIMI 2 slow
flow. There was TIMI 2 fast flow in the RCA proper. There was
diffuse disease in the mid-distal RCA before and after the long
[**Month/Year (2) 11919**]. The [**Month/Year (2) 11919**] had an origin 40% lesion. There was a patent,
modest caliber long RPL1 and a large RPL2 with diffuse plaquing
to 35% proximally. The RPL2 had small distal lateral branch that
was subtotally occluded.The distal AV groove RCA was 60%
diseased just after RPL2 leading into RPL3 which itself had a
proximal 40% lesion.
  2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left-sided filling
pressures. There was mild pulmonary arterial hypetension with
PASP of 40 mmHg. The PCWP was moderately elevated to 21 mmHg
with occasional prominent V waves consistent with significant
mitral regurgitation (ranging from 2
