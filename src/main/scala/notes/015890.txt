History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 71 yof with h/o bladder cancer and newly found gastric
mass and liver lesions, admitted with FTT x 3 weeks and
hypotensive episode after EGD today. Patient states that she has
had a caugh for the past 1 day, unsure about fevers at home. She
was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1266**], PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1262**] and at the time had a
low blood pressure and was recommended to [**Last Name (un) 5511**] the ER but pt
declined. Earlier this AM ([**12-24**]) patient underwent EGD with Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 679**], received midazolam 0.5mg IV and fentanyl 25mcg IV,
subsequently with no measurable blood pressure. She was
reportedly 60/30s after 500cc bolus. She came up to 94/47 after
2L NS. She was reportedly pale but alert during the episode. She
was transferred to the ED from EGD.
.
In the ED, her VS were T 96.9, HR 101, BP 94/60, RR 26, O2sat
98% 2L. She was given 2L NS, ceftriaxone 1g IV and azithromycin
500mg po. She had a CXR that showed early LLL infiltrate. CT
abdomen with stable R hydroureteronephrosis and fluid overload.
.
On ROS, she states she has had decreased appetite secondary to
nausea and [**4-17**] lb weight loss in the last 3 weeks. She has had
fatigue and malaise x 1 week. She has had no associated N/V,
abdominal pain, dysphagia, odynophagia, sick contacts, rash. She
denies dysuria or change in urinary frequency but reports dark
brown urine x 2 weeks.
.
Patient was admitted to the Medical floor and was noted to have
BP in 80s again, she was also noted to be tachypneic and
transferred to the MICU.

Past Medical History:

.
EKG: NSR at 114, nl axis, nl intervals. small qwaves inferiorly.
low limb lead voltage.
.
STUDIES:
CXR ([**12-24**])- Question early developing airspace process in the
lingular segment. There may be superimposed mild edema or more
chronic interstitial lung disease evident.
.
CT abd/pelv ([**12-24**], wet read)-
1. New bilateral pleural effusions, small amount of ascites, and
free fluid in the pelvis are consistent with volume overload.
2. stable severe right hydronephrosis.
3. diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
4. hiatal hernia.
5. liver lesions better seen on prior ct with contrast.
.
CT abd/pelv ([**12-17**])-
1. Interval worsening of the right-sided hydroureteronephrosis
with interval increase in size of a distal ureteral enhancing
lesion suspicious for tumor versus progression of scar tissue.
2. Interval development of the gastric antral mass and
peri-celiac and intra aorta caval lymphadenopathy is suspicious
for gastric adenocarcinoma, less likely lymphoma. In addition,
there has been interval development of multiple lesions within
the liver, which are suspicious for metastatic disease.
3. Four 1-2 mm nodules in the right lower lobe, which are most
likely inflammatory.
4. Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
.
eccho:
The left atrium is normal in size. A large probably sessile mass
is seen in
the body of the left atrium, occupying the majority of the
chamber, but does
not appear to be occluding the mitral valve. The attachment
point is not
well-defined, but may be the interatrial septum. Left
ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
small. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully
excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation
is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial
effusion.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 71 yof with h/o bladder cancer and recently found
gastric mass with liver involvement admitted with hypotension.

Ms [**Known lastname **] was considered likely to be significantly
hypovolemic considering her h/o decreased po intake, her urine
electrolyes which were prerenal, and her physical exam including
flat neck veins, tachycardia, hypotension.  She was felt less
likely to be septic given her lack of fever or leukocytosis but
was nevertheless treated for CAP.  Cortisol stim test revealed
appropriate stim.  She was aggressively fluid recussitated with
near 10L IVF over 36 hrs without improvement in oliguria,
tachycardia, or hypotension.  She was unfortunately found on
ecchocardiogram to have a large sessile mass nearly occluding
her right atrium.  It became clear that this was likely
impairing left heart filling; her LV was noted to be remarkably
small and hyperdynamic on eccho which would fit this picture.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] eventually became quite tachypneic with labored
breathing and evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR (although it is
likely that her tachypnea was also fueled by her serious
metabolic acidosis with a bicarb of 8).   She was also noted to
have thrombocytopenia and labs consistent with DIC.  Because of
Ms. [**Known lastname 17064**] underlying poor prognosis with an atrial mass and
likely malignancy, discussions were had with the patient and her
nephew [**Name (NI) 382**] and they decided to not pursue further invasive
care such as central line placement and vasopressors.  She was
made comfort measures only and received only one dose of 2mg
morphine for respiratory discomfort and she passed away within
30 minutes with her family at her side.  She had met with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2270**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1764**] with palliative care the day prior as well as Father [**Name (NI) **]
from pastoral care.  It was an honor to care for Ms. [**Known lastname **] in
her last days and I wish her family the best.
