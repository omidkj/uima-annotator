Radiology:
=========
[**2143-4-25**] CTA chest-
FINDINGS: The visualized portions of the lungs are clear without
evidence for pneumonic consolidations. Several small bullae are
seen consistent with emphysematous changes. There is no
mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. The heart [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] appear
normal. Pulmonary vasculatures are opacified without evidence
for intraluminal filling defects. There is no evidence for
aortic dissection. Descending aorta is tortuous.
.
Dome of the liver and spleen are unremarkable.
.
BONE WINDOWS: The vertebral bodies have a moth-eaten appearance
consistent with the patients history of MM.
.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of PE or pneumonia.
.
CXR [**2143-4-25**]:
PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Accounting for differences in
patient rotation and lower lung volumes, there appears to be no
significant interval change. The heart size, mediastinal and
hilar contours appear stable. The lungs appear clear without
consolidations. No pleural effusions are seen. No pulmonary
edema is seen.
.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process
.
[**2143-4-25**] Head CT:
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or
shift of normally midline structures, hydrocephalus or overt
major vascular territorial infarction. However, since the prior
examination, there has been probable interval development of a
triangular shaped 1 cm area of low absorption in the left
parietal vertex subcortical white matter. The finding is
nonspecific in etiology, but given the patient's age, could
represent an area of subacute to chronic infarction. In that
light, there are several additional areas of low absorption,
each under a centimeter in size within both cerebral hemispheres
that were likely seen on the prior study and could represent
chronic small vessel infarcts as well. There is mild bilateral
ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening and a tiny air-fluid level
within left maxillary sinus. These findings could well be a
consequence of the patient's intubated status.
.
CONCLUSION: No intracranial hemorrhage. Other findings as noted
above.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course:
======================
In the ED, the patient had diffuse exp wheezes, was hypoxic w/
O2 sat 88-90% on RA. He was given O2 5L/m by NC w/ O2 sat
increasing to 91-93%.  ABG was 7.25/84/57.  CXR was normal, CTA
was done to investigate for PE and was normal.  Rectal temp was
101.4F.  He was empirically treated w/ prednisone 60mg,
albuterol/atrovent nebs, and levoflox 500mg PO.  After receiving
ativan 2mg and dilaudid 1mg IV in prep for CTA, the pt became
lethargic.  He was treated w/ narcan x 3, initially effective in
restoring alertness, but 3rd dose was uneffective.  At that
time, he was intubated for airway protection.  A dx of
meningitis was considered, but LP was not performed due to INR
5.5; instead, he was empirically treated w/ levoflox 500mg,
vancomycin 1gm, and meropenem 1gm IV.  He was subsequently
transferred to the MICU for further care.
.
In the MICU, plan was for LP under fluroscopic guidance (after
failed at bedside). However, influenza cultures came back
positive for influenza A and it was felt that this explained his
fever, respiratory distress and altered mental status. Although
it had been about 72 hours since initiation of symptoms, it was
decided to start him on a course of tamiflu. In addition ,he
completed a steroid taper, along with a course of azithromycin
for his suspected reactive airways component. All other
antibiotics were discontinued. He was extubated and had
improvement in respiratory symptoms and improved mental status.

.
Of note, hospital course also complicated by episodes of
paroxysmal afib w/ HR in 140s-160s, without hemodynamic
instability. Rapid rate controlled with metoprolol. In addtion,
he was alre
