Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 78 year old female with history of polycystic
kidney disease s/p DDRT, HTN, diastolic CHF, who presents with
malaise, fever, and hypoxia. Pt reports overall malaise, not
feeling well for the past week or so. She has had nausea and
decreased PO intake. Yesterday developed SOB with band-like
tightness across her upper abdomen. Also had L-sided chest
discomfort 2 days ago. These symptoms are similar to previous
CHF exacerbation, per pt. Has had dry cough for past few days.
Denies diarrhea, but has loose stools on lactulose. Noted temp
to 100 at home earlier today and called EMS.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.6, P BP 209/107, R O2 sat 87%
on 4L NC. She was put on [**First Name3 (LF) 597**] and then BiPap. For her BP, nitro
paste was placed and then she was transitioned to a nitro gtt
with good BP response. Temp spiked to 102 rectally and so she
was started on vanco/zosyn. CXR consistent with volume overload.
BNP> 70,000. EKG with STE in V2-3 and STD in V5-6, trop 0.1
(baseline 0.06). Cards did not feel urgent heparin was
necessary. Pt also received zofran for nausea, hydrocortison
100mg IV x 1 (given chronic steroids). Admitted to the MICU for
further monitoring.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she reports feeling much improved. Still
complains of band-like discomfort across her abdomen. Denies
SOB.
.
Review of sytems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain.
Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in
bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or
myalgias.

Imaging:
CXR: [**2166-6-5**] IMPRESSION: Findings are most compatible with volume
overload and CHF. Repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis
is recommended to assess for underlying infection. Please note
the patient has had prior right upper lobe pneumonias, which
appear relatively similar to the added density noted on the
current study.

Echo [**2166-6-6**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal
free wall function. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2165-6-19**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is
reduced. There is increased evidence for delayed
relaxation/diastolic dysfunction od the left ventricle.
Significant pulmonary hypertension persists.

Abd X-ray [**2166-6-8**]: Again seen is marked degenerative change in
thoracolumbar spine, with severe scoliotic curvature.
Degenerative changes
are seen in the hips. The gas pattern remains non-specific, with
scattered
air in the small and large bowel, with air seen extending into
the rectum.
There is no evidence for obstruction on today's study. There is
no bowel wall thickening, pneumatosis, or supine evidence of
free air. Numerous surgical clips are again seen throughout the
mid abdomen.

IMPRESSION: Non-specific bowel gas pattern, with no dilated
loops of small
bowel and air seen extending to the rectum. There is no evidence
for
obstruction.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 78 year-old female with Polycystic Kidney disease
status post renal transplant admitted to the MICU for Pulmonary
edema.

1) Pulmonary Edema:  The patient was admitted to the MICU with
flash pulmonary edema from hypertension/CHF.  She was admitted
and weaned from a nitro drip and her BPs returned to [**Location 213**]
140s. Initial concern for Pneumonia prompted tratment with
Vanc/Zosyn/Levaquin that was discontinued after normal CXR and
improving respiratory function.  TTE showed decreased ejection
fraction. She was aggressively diuresed with Lasix IV and her
symptoms resolved.  After transfer to the medical floor, the
patient's oxygen requirement resolved and she was discharged
with home physical thearapy.  No changes to Heart Failure or
renal regimen.

2) Polycystic Renal Disease, s/p Transplant:  The patient was
admitted with Creatinine elevated between 2.9-3.1. She was
continued on her anti-rejection therapy, and discharged on her
home lasix dose.

3) Elevated Troponin: The patient did have elevated troponin
without specific EK changes.  She was briefly started on
Aspirin, but stopped given her GI bleed history after not
convincingly ruling in for myocardial infarction.

4) Anemia of Chronic disease with possible iron deficiency
component:  Patient continued on Epogen and started on Iron
