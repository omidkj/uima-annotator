PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, he had a blood
pressure of 90/palpable, pulse 142, respiratory rate 24.  The
pupils were equal.  He did have a forehead laceration and a
nasal fracture.  Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate
and rhythm.  His chest was consistent with a flail on the
left.  Trachea was midline.  He had decreased breath sounds
on the left.  His abdomen was soft and nondistended.  Pelvis
was stable.  Extremities were warm.  Rectal examination was
guaiac negative.  He did have decreased rectal tone.

LABORATORY DATA:  Chest x-ray showed a rib fracture on the
left.  CT showed a left subdural with a shift and negative
cervical spine.  He had negative CT of the abdomen and
pelvis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Neurosurgical consultation was obtained
and, because of the subdural hematoma, he was taken
emergently to the operating room for evacuation on [**2185-8-22**].
He underwent on [**2185-8-22**], as well, a left craniotomy with
evacuation of subdural hematoma and left frontal partial
lobectomy.  Venodynes were continued.  He underwent another
operation on [**2185-8-23**], for right frontal hematoma and
evacuation of the hematoma was done.

He had also some intraparenchymal blood which was, of course,
not drained, and he was continued on supportive care.  This
revealed evidence of a pulmonary contusion.  He was started
on TPN and he neurologically stabilized and he did have
fevers.

Ventricular drain placed on [**2185-8-30**], to monitor pressures
and his family was informed that he had a very poor
prognosis.

He underwent bronchoscopy on [**2185-8-31**], with no obvious
secretions being seen.  Metabolic support was continued.
Neurosurgery continued to follow and Mannitol was
discontinued on [**2185-9-2**].  He was opening both eyes to
stimulation.  He was hyponatremic as well and this was
corrected.  Fevers continued.  He was continued on intubation
and ventilation.

increasingly poor prognosis.  Comfort measure care was
instituted and on [**2185-9-6**], the patient expired.
