Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
CC: code stroke called at 7:26 pm, at the patient's bedside by
7:30 pm.

HPI: 68 year old left handed woman, with a history of dementia,
HTN, previous breast cancer, who around 6:00 pm became confused.
She had woken up from a nap, and was about to have a cup of tea
with her son, and complained of a headache, and feeling sick.
She
stated to her son that she was having a sinus headache, and had
complained of a headache before she went to bed the previous
night. Her son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 15427**] was unable to describe the character
or exact location of the headache. She started to want to vomit
and began to gag. He seated his mother down on the couch, and
she
became more disoriented, so he called 911. By the time the EMS
arrived, she was completely confused as to what they were doing
in the room. A few minutes after they arrived around 6:20 pm,
she
started to slouch in the couch to the left, clench her hands and
started shaking them, her legs were straight out, and she
started
frothing at the mouth with a glazed expression. She was
unresponsive and mute. Prior to this, she had been able to
answer
and understand questions in her normal manner. The episode
lasted
10-15 minutes, and her son thought that she was having a
seizure.
The EMS placed an oxygen mask on her face, and she remained
unresponsive.

Of note she had taken Ibuprofen and Tylenol the previous night
for her headache, and when she woke up in the morning. Her son
had offered to take her to the ER in the morning, but she
mentioned that it was her usual sinus headache, which she saw
her
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]. According to her son, yesterday, they went to [**Name (NI) 15428**] as usual, and she was at her baseline.

By the time that I saw her in the ER, she was already intubated
and paralyzed for airway protection. An ROS was unobtainable.
According to the ER physicians she had a flaccid right sided
paralysis on arrival, which was not appreciable after intubation
and paralysis.


Past Medical History:
Left breast cancer(in records, but son unaware of any history)
asthma vs COPD.  Also remote hx of GYN cancer (s/p hysterectomy
in her 20s, further details unknown)
hypertension Benicar stopped a month ago according to her son
mild dementia on formal neuropsych testing(although son states
deficits are no longer mild)-seen by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6817**]
[**2167-11-11**] - Mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation on U/S,
Cholelithiasis w/o son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence of acute cholecystitis &
she had a UTI.

Past Surgical History:
Tonsillectomy, appendectomy, breast
surgery, hysterectomy, and some sort of bladder neck suspension.


Social History:
SH: Lives in [**Location **] with her son.  She goes out of the house
once a day to visit [**Company 2486**]. Capable of ADL's, but does
not
drive or balance a cheque book. Gave up smoking 20 years ago,
prior to that she had been a heavy smoker for 40 years. She does
not drink alcohol or use recreational drugs. She worked in a
cafeteria.

CT head [**2167-2-23**]
1. Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left posterior parietal cortex
at the
vertex.
2. No evidence of acute infarct. MRI is more sensitive for the
detection of acute ischemia.

MRI head, MRA / MRV [**2167-2-23**]

1. Extensive areas of signal abnormality with nodular
enhancement throughout
the brain, many of which are centered at the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
junction, with
both supra- and infra-tentorial compartments involvement as well
as
involvement of deep [**Doctor Last Name 352**] nuclei.

Differential considerations include an infectious process, which
may be
related to septic emboli (although the lack of more widespread
associated
blood products and infarction is unusual, given the extent of
the
abnormalities), atypical infections such as tuberculosis,
neoplastic processes
such as metastatic disease or lymphoma, toxic metabolic
processes (given deep
[**Doctor Last Name 352**] structure involvement and somewhat bilateral diffuse
symmetric
appearance), as well as other more atypical patterns of emboli,
such as from
an atrial myxoma or bland endocarditis.

2. The left parietal blood products seen on the preceding CT
scan could be
due to septic or bland embolism, or an infectious process.
However, they
could also be indicative of venous ischemia secondary to the
underlying
pathologic process.

3. No evidence of venous sinus thrombosis. While the large
cortical veins
appear patent, MRV is not sensitive for evaluation of cortical
veins.

4. Unremarkable MRAs of the head and neck, without evidence of a

hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysm.

5. Areas of increased signal intensity within the left lobe of
thyroid gland,
incompletely characterized on the current study. Correlation
with thyroid
laboratory data and/or ultrasound is recommended.

TTE [**2167-2-24**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely
