CXR: Re-expanded left lung s/p chest tube placement

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was initially admitted to the thoracic surgery
service, then transferred to the MICU, then called out to the
floor.

1) Respiratory Failure: The patient is on 3L nasal cannula at
home.  He initially presented with dyspnea on [**9-30**].  A CXR
demonstrated a 75% Left Pneumothorax and a chest tube was placed
with subsequent resolution demonstrated on CXR.  On [**10-1**], Chest
CT obtained:
--"Interval chest tube insertion.  Increased opacity along the
left major
fissure with associated volume loss, suggestive of atelectasis.
A small
amount of residual loculated fluid is also noted in the major
fissure. This
has decreased compared to the two prior CT scans. There is also
extensive
subcutaneous air, and a small left anterobasilar pneumothorax.
-- Narrowing of the lingular bronchus.  Considering distal
atelectasis,
correlation with bronchoscopy may be considered to exclude an
obstructing
lesion, if clinically indicated.
--Diffuse emphysematous changes, with bullous formation in the
right lung
  base.
--Stable right renal cyst, and likely left adrenal adenoma."

The patient was doing well on the floor until [**10-2**] when he
vomited with aspiration and had a desaturation to 68% on 4L and
86% on NRB.  He was intubated and transferred to the MICU.  On
[**10-3**] a bronchoscopy demonstrated copious b/l secretions.  RSBI
was 50 on [**10-4**], and he was weaned to face mask on with oxygen
sats in the 88-92% range on 4L.  The Chest tube was D/C'd on
[**10-5**].  The patient did well on the floor with stable O2 sats on
3L N.C., albeit with persisent hemoptysis and productive cough.
The patient will need a CXR 1 month following D/C (prior to
follow-up with Thoracic Surgery).  (See ID for details on
aspiration pneumonia)

2)COPD/Bronchospasm: He was continued on albuterol/atrovent nebs
standing.  He was started on a slow prednisone taper of 60
mg/day on [**10-4**].  Placed on Ca, MVI, PPI, ISS while on steroids.

3)ID: He was initially treated with Levo/Flagyl for aspiration
RML and RLL pneumonia .  Vancomycin was added on [**10-3**] given
presence of gram + cocci on expectorated [**Month/Year (2) **] sample on [**10-3**].
On [**10-6**] coverage was changed to ceftaz and vanco (for 14 day
course) given pseudomonas from the aforementioned [**Month/Year (2) **] sample.
 Insulin control with sliding scale to optimize WBC function.

4)FEN: A Speech and swallow evaluation was obtained on [**10-6**]
which demonstrated that the patient could swallow all substances
but thin liquids were recommended.

5)Depression:Zoloft was continued per outpatient regimen.

6) Anemia: Thought to be secondary to hemoptysis.  Guaiac (-)
black stool (?secondary to Fe supplements).  Hct checked [**Hospital1 **] and
stable.  Supplemented with Fe, eventhough MCV was 96 and Fe
studies were WNL.

7) EP: Patient is s/p cardioversion for afib.  Maintained on
amiodarone (and continued inpatient with great caution given
underlying lung disease).  Advised to reconsider this medication
as an outpatient.

8)Access: A Left subclavian line was placed to administer
sedatives and for central access during intubation.  A PICC line
was placed on [**10-9**] and the Left subclavian line was
discontinued.

9)Proph: PPI, SC Heparin tid

10)Code/Comm: FULL CODE.  Care discussed with brother.
