Chief Complaint:
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  chest pain
REASON FOR ADMISSION TO CCU: inferior STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with DES to RCA [**2109-3-18**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 405**] is a 59y/o gentleman with no significant PMH
besides obesity and [**Known lastname **] who presented to the ED due to chest
pain and is being admitted to the CCU s/p cardiac cath with RCA
stenting for inferior STEMI.
.
He was in his otherwise good state of health until 2AM today
when he developed acute onset of chest pain that woke him up
from sleep.  It is described as substernal/left sternal pressure
radiating to the jaw.  Was associated with mild SOB but no
nausea or diaphoresis.  He was concerned that he might be having
a heart attack so he took an ASA and called EMS.  Received
another ASA by EMS and arrived to the ED at 4:40AM.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were HR 63, BP 168/95, RR 16, POx 99%
2L NC.  Over the next hour his BP increased to 196/114, HR up to
120.  Labs and imaging significant for Trop-T 0.07.  Cr was 1.7.
 EKG showed ST elevations in II, III, aVF and ST depressions in
I, aVL as well as V1-V2.  Patient was given 1L normal saline,
Morphine 5mg IV, Plavix 600mg PO, was started on Heparin gtt and
was taken to the cath lab.  There, he was found to have RCA 95%
lesion which was stented as well as a mid-LAD 80% lesion with no
intervention.  He was still hypertensive and tachycardic.  He
was started on a NTG drip for hypertension and received Metop
5mg IV x4 for tachycardia.  Right groin was angiosealed, right
venous sheath in place.  After the procedure he complained of
some chest tightness similar to his [**Known lastname **] symptoms and he was
given Lasix 20mg IV.
.
On arrival to the CCU, patient feels well.  No more shortness of
breath.  No chest pain.  He is glad that he called EMS.  He
mentions that though he does not exercise, at his baseline he is
very active at work as a landscaping contractor.  He can usually
walk more than 5 flights of stairs before becoming short of
breath, and he has never had chest pain before today.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

[**2109-3-18**] EKG:
Acute inferoapical ST segment elevation myocardial infarction
with reciprocal ST segment depression in leads I, aVL and V1-V3.
The underlying rhythm is probably sinus with ventricular and
atrial ectopy as well as variable A-V block. Suggest clinical
correlation and repeat tracing. No previous tracing available
for comparison.
.
[**2109-3-18**] EKG:
Normal sinus rhythm. Borderline first degree A-V block. Diffuse
non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. ST segment elevation in
the inferoapical leads and reciprocal ST segment depression are
no longer seen. Suggest clinical correlation.
.
[**2109-3-18**] TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
near akinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls and mild
hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 30-35 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with regional and global systolic
dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process. Mild
mitral regurgitation.

[**2109-3-18**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
[final report pending]

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 405**] is a 59y/o obese gentleman with no known CAD risk
factors who presented to the ED with an inferior wall STEMI, and
was admitted to the CCU s/p cardiac cath with DES to RCA.
During his stay, he was started on cardiac meds and was
discharged home.

#. Inferior STEMI: with chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes,
EKG changes.
Patient presented to the ED with a few hours of crushing chest
pain, EKG findings suggested inferior wall STEMI. Cath lab
emergently activated and patient received a DES to 95% stenotic
RCA. Patient arrived to CCU chest pain free and hemodynamically
stable. Of note, patient still with residual CAD including a LAD
80% stenosis which was not intervened upon. Patient was Plavix
loaded with 600mg then transitioned to daily 75 mg, he also
received Aspirin, Atorvastatin and started on Metoprolol XL and
Lisinopril for continued tachycardia and hypertension.  TTE
after catheterization showed mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with regional and global systolic dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD or other diffuse process. Mild mitral
egurgitatio
