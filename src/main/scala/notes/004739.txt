History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 50M with PMH of metastatic RCC s/p nephrectomy, IL-2,
mini-allograft SCT, DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary
fibrosis on home 02 who presented to OSH after 2 weeks of
worsening dyspnea. Per OSH records pt had chronic worsening of
dyspnea x 2-3 weeks with acute worsening over 2-3 days. Had been
self medicating with increased home 02 and inhalers to which he
stopped responding. He had myalgias and headaches at home. Mild
purulent sputum production.
At OSH he was hypoxic to 60% 02, hypotensive to 80s, febrile to
102. His CXR per report showed evidence of pulmonary fibrosis
but no clear infiltrate. Pt was given IVF, empirically started
on zosyn and levaquin for PNA, given IV hydrocortisone 75mg Q8
and started on levophed. His systolic pressures responded to
120s. He was placed on NIPPV with fi02 70% with 02 sats
maintained in 90%s.
PPD planted [**4-15**] at OSH on left arm.
WBC 17, repeat 20. 79-80% PMN, no bands. Cr 1.1. mets to
adrenal, pelvis, mediastinal nodes, spine. Some elevations on
CEs, continuing to rise. TTE with RV dysfunction, septal
deviation, PA pressure 50-60. EF 70%. Platelets ok.
Ruled out for flu
Seen at by OSH ID consult: Recommended empiric coverage for CAP
as well as for OIs with Zosyn, Levaquin, Bactrim IV,
caspogungin, and acyclovir as well as discontinuing steroids.
He requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] where he receives his cancer
care.
Upon arrival pt is intubated and sedated. Had been off pressors
for duration of transport.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment/Plan:
50M h/o metastatic renal CA s/p nephrectomy, IL-2,
mini-allograft SCT, DLI x 2 last in [**12-8**], emphysema/pulmonary
fibrosis on home 02 presents with sepsis.
.
Admission Assessment and Plan
# Sepsis: Likely pneumonia given new opacities on CXR, although
difficult to read due to fibrosis. No other apparent localizing
symptoms. Ruled-out for flu at OSH. Urine, GI sources less
probable. Given immunocompromise from malignancy, at risk for
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1065**], etc. Progression of GVHD could be contributing.
- IVF resuscitation for MAP>65
- Vanc, zosyn, levofloxacin, bactrim, caspofungin to cover
broadly for now given critical illness
- Blood, urine, sputum cultures
- Legionella antigen, glucan, galactomannan
- CT chest and possible bronch when more stable
- Follow WBC count, fever curve
- PPD to be read [**4-17**]
.
# Respiratory failure: Pneumonia in patient with poor pulmonary
reserve due to emphysema, GVHD, fibrosis. Avoid high pressures
given fibrotic lungs, will attempt pressure control to limit.
- Continue mechanical ventilatory support, wean as tolerated
.
# Acidosis: Primary respiratory, non-gap, lactate normal.
Increase minute ventilation. [**Month (only) 116**] require paralysis for adequate
ventilation.
.
# Hypotension: Likely sepsis, although probably component of
hypovolemia as well. At risk for PE given malignancy. GI bleed
unlikely as Hct stable. Adrenal insufficiency possible.
- Treat broadly per above
- [**Last Name (un) **] stim in AM
- LENIs
- Guaiac stools
.
# Cardiac: Patient with probable demand ischemia in setting of
hypotension, tachycardia, and sepsis; less likely unstable
plaque.
- Continue to trend enzymes and treat underlying cause
- ASA, hold on beta-blocker and statin
- TTE to eval for wall motion abnormality
- Repeat ECG
.
# Metastatic renal CA: Recurrent disease s/p donor lymphocyte
transplant [**12-8**].
- BMT to follow
- Avoid steroids given risk to graft
- Continue acyclovir ppx for now, will discuss with BMT
.
-------------
Brief summary of hospital course. Patient remained intubated
throughout hospital stay.  Was treated with broad spectrum
antibiotics for sepsis.  Extensive infectious work-up was
non-revealing.  Given his immunocompromised status empiric
anti-[**Month/Year (2) 1065**] therapy was begun as well.  No clear source
identified for infection but beta-glucan returned positive day
prior to patient's death suggesting some component of possible
underlying [**Month/Year (2) 1065**] sepsis.  AM cortisol pre-stim revealed
adequate adrenal capacity excluding adrenal insufficiency as a
cause for hypotensive shock.  Bronchoscopy performed and was
non-revealing (on antibiotics).  Baseline lung disease with
fibrosis [**2-3**] to GVHD and need for aggressive fluid resuscitation
lead to increasing difficulty with ventilation.  Patient became
progressively more acidemic [**2-3**] to CO2 retention.  In setting of
hypotension developed shock liver with transaminases in 10
