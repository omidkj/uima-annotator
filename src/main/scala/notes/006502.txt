p/w shortness of breath x this morning. The patient woke this AM
at around 7 am feeling short of breath with the sense his heart
was "fluttering." Denies associated CP. Symptoms have continued
intermittently since that time with varying degrees of severity.
The patient was just d/c'd from [**Hospital1 18**] yesterday to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab
with a dx of COPD exacerbation, possible PNA, and an episode of
AF to the 140s requiring ibutylide for conversion. Transferred
back to [**Hospital1 18**] after pt's condition was noted on morning rounds
at rehab.

notable for Pt was given dilt 10 mg then 20 mg with minimal
effect. Also given lopressor 5 mg X 2 with minimal effect. Pt
given dilt bolus and placed on gtt, though HR remained in the
130s. Transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 6 for further management.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 yo male with a past medical history significant for severe
COPD and AS s/p [**Month/Day/Year 1291**] admitted to the CCU for acute shortness of
breath.

Patient's most recent cardiac cath without evidence of
flow-limiting stenoses and without chest pain.  Cardiac enzymes
negative, such that myocardial infarction was unlikely cause for
shortness of breath.  Furthermore, pt had preserved ejection
fraction and appeared euvolemic without evidence of heart
failure.  Lastly, porcine aortic valve appeared to be stable
without any evidence of failure.

However, pt did continue to have atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response despite recent titration of procainamide.
This was felt to be the most likely etiology for shortness of
breath.  Therefore, in consultation with EP, patient was
uptitrated again on procainamide with good effect in conjunction
with beta blocker and diltiazem for rate control.  Levels were
checked after uptitration and were within therapeutic window.

In addition, given severity of COPD, it was felt that empiric
treatment with corticosteroid pulse would be helpful, and pt was
started again on 125 methylprednisolone along with frequent use
of bronchodilators.  Course of levofloxacin was completed as
planned prior to this hospitalization, though no evidence of
pneumonia was found.

Of note, pt did have elevation in WBC of unclear etiology to a
peak of 34.4.  CDiff was negative, though pt did not have
diarrhea.  Interestingly, as steroids were slowly tapered
downward, WBC trended downward also, suggestive of demargination
as a source of leukocytosis.  Otherwise, no other localizing
symptoms or signs of infection were identified, and pt remained
afebrile.

At the time of discharge, pt continued to require 4-5 liters
supplemental O2 consistent with the likely endstage nature of
his COPD.  Although goals of care discussions were held, no
definite plan was made.  It did, however, seem that pt had
appropriate expectations given the degree of his progressive
illness.
