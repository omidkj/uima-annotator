History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 84178**] is an 86 year old man who has been experiencing
increasing episodes of chest discomfort and fatigue over the
past month.  A recent echocardiogram revealed an EF of 45% with
modest aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 1.2) and moderate
aortic regurgitation and 2+ mitral regurgitation and modest
tricuspid regurgitation. A subsequent cath revealed 90% LM and

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo
contrast in the LAA. Depressed LAA emptying velocity (<0.2m/s)

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter.
Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Focal calcifications in aortic arch. Simple atheroma
in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
Moderate AS (area 1.0-1.2cm2) Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation.
patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo
contrast is present in the left atrial appendage. The left
atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.

There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results on Mr.[**Known lastname 84178**]
before surgical incision.
Post_Bypass:
Normal RV systolic function.
LVEF 40%.
Intact thoracic aorta.
The bioprosthetic aortic valve is stable and functioning well.
NO periprosthetic leaks. Residual mean gradient is 4mm of Hg.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 84178**] was admitted and taken tot he operating room for the
following:(see operative note for details)

1. Aortic valve replacement with a 27-mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic
    ULTRA Bioprosthesis.
2. Coronary bypass grafting x3 with the left internal
    mammary artery, left anterior descending coronary;
    reversed after sustaining a single graft from the aorta
    to ramus intermedius coronary artery; as well as reverse
    saphenous vein single-graft from the aorta to the first
    obtuse marginal coronary artery.
3. Resection of left atrial appendage.
4. Endoscopic left greater saphenous vein harvesting.

Post operatively he remained intubated and was admitted to the
CVICU for invasive hemodynamic monitoring and care. He awoke
neurologically intact and was weaned from the ventilator and
extubated without difficulty. Mr. [**Known lastname 84180**] chest tubes and
temporary pacing wires were removed per protocol. He was started
on betablockers, statins and diuresed toward his pre-operative
weight however he continues to have 2+ LE edema bilateral which
is being treated with IV lasix and zaroxyln. He remains in rate
controlled atrial fibrillation. Mr. [**Known lastname 84178**] was anticoagulated
with coumadin. He was evaluated and treated by physical therapy
for strength and conditioning. He was noted to have endo-vein
harvest site cellulitus on POD 8 and was placed on Vancomycin.
Leukocytosis was persistent, and ID was consulted and agreed
with vancomycin treatment.  He developed loose stools and his
laxatives were tapered and C-diff toxin would return negative
twice.  Cellulitis did improve on vancomycin.
Rehab was recommmended upon discharge. Mr. [**Known lastname 84178**] was
discharged to rehab on POD #17 after being cleared for discharge
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**].
