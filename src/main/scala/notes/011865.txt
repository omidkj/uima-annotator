RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2135-7-29**] 9:23 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate effusion on r/l

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
55 year old man s/p CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate effusion on r/l
INDICATION: Status post CABG, evaluate effusion.

COMPARISON: [**2135-7-27**].

CHEST, TWO VIEWS: Persistent mild cardiomegaly. Mediastinal and
hilar contours are unchanged. Nondisrupted median sternotomy
wires and radiographic stigmata of CABG again seen. There is a
persistent tiny apical pneumothorax seen laterally in the left
chest. There are persistent small bilateral pleural effusions.
Bibasal atelectasis has improved slightly as demonstrated by
decreased left retrocardiac opacity. Imaged skeletal system is
grossly normal.

IMPRESSION: Slightly improved radiographic chest. Persistent
small bilateral effusion although decreased associated
atelectasis; persistent tiny apical pneumothorax seen in the
left lung laterally.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: *4.8 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm)
Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length: 5.0 cm (nl <= 5.2 cm)
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: *1.2 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1

Aorta - Descending Thoracic: 2.1 cm (nl <= 2.5 cm)
Mitral Valve - MVA (P [**1-4**] T): 3.8 cm2

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No mass/thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
LAA. Good (>20
cm/s) LAA ejection velocity. All four pulmonary veins identified
and enter the
left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA
and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D
images. Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Low normal
LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Borderline normal RV
systolic
function.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta
diameter. Focal calcifications in ascending aorta. Simple
atheroma in aortic
arch. Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. No MS. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
for the
patient.

Conclusions:
PRE CPB The left atrium is mildly dilated. No mass/thrombus is
seen in the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function is
borderline normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

POST CPB Normal biventricular systolic function. Thoracic aorta
intact. No
other changes from pre-CPB findings.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was transferred from OSH and immediately underwent
routine pre-operative testing for surgery. On [**1-25**] he was
brought to the operating room where he underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft x 4. Please see operative report for
surgical details. He tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Later on op day he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact, and was extubated. On post-op day one he
was started on beta blockers and diuretics. He was gently
diuresed towards his pre-op weight. Chest tubes were removed on
post-op day two and he was transferred to the floor.  On
epicardial pacing wires on post-op day three. Physical therapy
followed him during entire post-op course for strength and
mobility. He continued to make steady process without any
post-op complications and was discharged home with VNA services
on post-op day four.
