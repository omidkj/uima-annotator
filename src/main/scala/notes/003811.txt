Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2183-2-13**]):    NO GROWTH.

IMAGING:
TTE [**2183-1-31**]
No thrombus/mass is seen in the body of the left atrium. No mass
or thrombus is seen in the right atrium or right atrial
appendage. There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 30-35 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending, transverse and descending
thoracic aorta are free of atherosclerotic plaque to 45 cm from
the incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or
