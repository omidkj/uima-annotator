Chief Complaint:
Agitation, s/p fall with right shoulder dislocation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right shoulder close reduction under anesthesia on [**2179-6-19**]

History of Present Illness:
64 yoM with history of IDDM, seizure d/o, had fall at home last
night. Has fairly frequent falls per wife ([**2-3**] x month),
especially when taking excess benzos (per wife, will often go
through a one month prescription in 10 days). Last night fell
and told wife to call 911; initially at MWMC where found to have
right shoulder dislocation. They were unable to reduce (given
etomidate for sedation) thus transferred to [**Hospital1 **]. Also unable to
reduce in our ED. While in the ED, noted to be confused and
intermittently agitated. Took to OR for closed reduction under
sedation, post intervention pt severely agitated and combative.
Given risk for damage to shoulder joint, patient was intubated
and sedated. In the [**Name (NI) 13042**] pt was also found to have groin and
scrotal wounds and was given antibiotic. Central line place as
no other access available.

IMAGING:
FOREARM (AP & LAT) RIGHT Study Date of [**2179-6-19**] 4:53:
RIGHT SHOULDER, TWO VIEWS; RIGHT ELBOW, TWO VIEWS: The humeral
head is
located anteriorly and inferomedially to the glenoid fossa
difficult to assess on the axially view. There is a lucency
through the glenoid fossa concerning for a fracture. There is an
large bone fragment proximal to this lucency suggestive of a
greater tubercle fracture The acromioclavicular joint appears
intact. No rib fractures are visualized in the field of view.
The upper lung visualized appears normal.

IMPRESSION:
1. Right shoulder dislocation with greater tubercle fracture and
possible
fracture of the glenoid fossa.
2. Chondroid lession of the humeral head.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2179-6-19**] 6:46 AM
Non-contrast head CT was performed. There is no intracranial
hemorrhage, and no parenchymal edema or mass effect. Prominence
of the sulci and ventricles, most likely reflects parenchymal
atrophy. There is minimal periventricular white matter
hypodensity, compatible with sequelae of chronic small vessel
infarction, and a more focal lacunar infarct in the left centrum
semiovale.  There is no shift of normally midline structures,
and the basal cisterns are preserved. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
differentiation is preserved, without CT evidence of acute large
vascular territory infarction.

There are no acute fractures identified. Deformity of the left
zygomatic arch may reflect prior trauma. There is partial
opacification of the left mastoid air cells, without apparent
temporal bone fracture. Mucus retention cystversus polyp is seen
in the left sphenoid sinus. The remainder of the paranasal
sinuses are normally aerated.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process, including no hemorrhage.

2. Partial opacification of the left mastoid air cells. No
evidence for
fracture. Deformity of the left zygomatic arch, without
associated soft
tissue contusion, may reflect chronic injury.

3. Parenchymal atrophy and mild chronic small vessel
infarcts.Medial temporal
atrophy.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2179-6-19**] 6:47 AM
IMPRESSION: No definite fracture or traumatic malalignment
involving the
cervical spine. Degenerative at C4-5 and C5-6 is noted, with
posterior disc osteophyte causing moderate canal stenosis at
C4-5, and some anterior disc space widening at C5-6 with
fragmented osteophytes, which appear well
corticated and likely chronic. There is no prevertebral soft
tissue swelling.

CT UP EXT W/O C Study Date of [**2179-6-19**] 7:21 AM
FINDINGS: There is anterior inferior dislocation of the humeral
head which
lies inferior to the glenoid. There is a comminuted fracture of
the greater tuberosity with superior lateral displacement. The
fracture fragment measures 3.4 x 2.2 cm (series 2:30). The
glenoid is grossly intact. There are mild degenerative changes.
A chondroid lesion is seen within the humeral head, suggestive
of an enchondroma. There is a large lipohemarthrosis.

This examination is not dedicated to evaluation of the soft
tissues. There is edema and hematoma within the adjacent
muscles. The supra- and infra-spinatus tendons insert upon the
greater tuberosity fracture fragment.

The visualized lung fields demonstrate dependent atelectasis.

IMPRESSION:

1. Anterior inferior glenohumeral joint dislocation with humeral
head lying inferior to the glenoid.

2. 3.4 cm displaced greater tuberosity fracture fragment.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2179-6-20**] 5:16 PM
CT ABDOMEN: The heart is top normal in size. There is
atherosclerotic
calcification of the coronary arteries. There is a trace amount
of
pericardial fluid. Bibasilar airspace disease is identified,
right greater
than left. The spleen, liver, adrenal glands, gallbladder,
pancreas, and
kidneys are normal in appearance given lack of intravenous
contrast.
Incidentally noted is a small duodenal diverticulum. The
remainder of the
bowel is unremarkable in appearance with no evidence of bowel
obstruction or bowel wall thickening. Calcification is noted
within the descending aorta.  There is no retroperitoneal or
mesenteric lymphadenopathy. No free air or free fluid is noted
in the abdomen.

CT PELVIS: There are no pelvic masses or lymphadenopathy.
Calcifications are noted centrally within
