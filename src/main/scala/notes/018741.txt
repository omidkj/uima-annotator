Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 530**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
82 yom with history of HTN, COPD, who presents today with
shortness of breath and cough.  He was in his usual state of
health until 3-4 days ago when he noticed shortness of breath
worse with exertion.  He felt congested and was having an
occasionally productive cough.  He tried taking mucinex which
helped somewhat but did not improve his symtpoms completely.  He
notes the shortness of breath is worse at night but denies
orthopnea or sleeping on increased pillows.  He had an admission
for similar symptoms in [**2169**] which were attributed to a COPD
exacerbation (though pt thought it was for pneumonia).  He says
this feels the same.  He is not on home O2, just advair and
combivent.  He denies fevers, but did have some nightsweats over
the past couple nights.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98 BP 131/56  HR: 71  RR: 30s
O2: 95-100% 3L. Patient was given albuterol/ipatropium neb and
felt better but still tachypenic and cant wean of O2 (only 90%).
Got solumederol prior to admission.  CXR showed no pneumonia or
vascular congestion.
.
Upon arriving to the floor, pt appears comfortable.  He is
tachypenic to 30 but otherwise looks well.  He is very talkative
and not short of breath while talking
.

.
CXR [**2171-5-5**]: There are lucencies of the apices consistent with
emphysematous change. Note is made of an azygos lobe. Chronic
basilar interstitial changes are stable in appearance. The heart
and mediastinum are within normal limits. Note is again made of
calcification of the aortic knob.  There is no pleural effusion
or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Emphysema, with no acute thoracic pathology.
.
[**2171-5-7**] ECG: Sinus rhythm with borderline sinus tachycardia.
Rightward axis. Prominent inferior lead Q waves are
non-diagnostic. Modest inferior lead ST-T wave changes are
non-specific. Since the previous tracing of same date sinus
tachycardia rate is slower, delayed precordial QRS transition
pattern is less prominent and inferior lead ST-T wave changes
are decreased.
.
CXR [**2171-5-9**]: IMPRESSION: Bilateral opacifications concerning for
pneumonia, unchanged since [**2171-5-7**].
.
Micro:    RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2171-5-8**]):

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 82-year-old man with medical history
significant for COPD, presenting with shortness of breath and
likely COPD exacerbation
.
# COPD exacerbation/pneumonia:  Patient's symptoms and exam
point to likely COPD exacerbation as evidenced by wheezing on
exam and low O2 sats with improvement of symptoms with
nebulizers.  Of note, patient did have hospitalization in [**2169**]
for COPD exacerbation.  The patient did have a leukocystosis,
which resolved originally, and the patient was afebrile during
his hospitalization. Chest X-ray showed no sign of infiltrate.
Albuterol/ipratroprium nebulizers were provided. The patient was
started on prednisone 60mg daily with plan for taper. The
patient was also started on azythromycin for COPD exacerbation
and also in the less likely case of possible pneumonia. He was
weaned within a day to room air and was saturating at the low to
mid 90s.  However, on HD 3, the patient developed acute
respiratory distress.  He was not seen to aspirate, though his
CXR showed new bilateral lower lobe haziness.  He was
transferred to the MICU and placed on Bipap.  He was empirically
started on HCAP with Vanco/Cefepime/Azithro.  His nebs were
increased to q2prn and over the course of 1 night on Bipap
improved.  Serial CXR showed a worsening left lower lobe
infiltrate which was likely the cause for the worsening. He was
transferred back to the medical floor, where his antibiotic
regimen was tailored to cefepime and azithromycin. Patient
improved and was seen by Physical Therapy, who did not see the
need for acute physical therapy but noted tendency to desaturate
upon activity. Rehab for the continuation of antibiotics and
strengthening was determined to be the best option. The
patient's prednisone was planned for taper on discharge.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]:  Creatinine at 1.3, which was stable from last year. On
the day he was sent to the MICU his creatinine increased from
1.3 to 1.8.  He was bladder scanned and had >450cc retained.
After foley put in, his creatinine decreased, so obstructive
pathology was possible.  Also held ACEi and HCTZ. By discharge,
the patient's creatinine had returned to baseline or below.
.
# Indigestion/possible GI bleed: The patient complained that his
stomach felt as though he "ate something bad." His BUN is
increased out of proportion to his creatinine, which suggests he
may have a mild GI bleed. His hematocrit does not suggest a
brisk bleed. He was placed on pantoprazole and will need
follow-up.
.
# BPH:  Continued on home terazosin therapy. Added finasteride 5
mg PO daily for urinary retention. Will need PRN straight caths
until this improves. It is exacerbated by Foley trauma.
.
# Hyperlipidemia:  Continued on home simvastatin 10mg daily.
.
# Hypertension:  Continued on home regimen of HCTZ 12.5 mg
daily, lisinopril 20 mg daily, verapamil 60mg QID until he
developed renal failure.  Then lisinopril and HCTZ were held
because of acute kidney injury.
.
The patient will need outpatient follow up for possible GI bleed
causing elevated BUN.
