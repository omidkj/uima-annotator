[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
86 year old man with cad
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p cabg, no access
HISTORY: 86-year-old man with coronary artery disease, needs
antibiotics.

RADIOLOGIST: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

FINDINGS: The right arm was prepped sterilely. Under ultrasound
guidance, the right basilic vein was identified and punctured
with 21-gauge needle after administration of 5 cc of 1%
lidocaine for local anesthesia. A 0.018 guidewire was advanced
under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava. The appropriate
length of the catheter was measured using the markers on the
guidewire. 38 cm length was measured to be appropriate. The PICC
line was trimmed to this length and advanced over a 4.5-French
introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior
vena cava. The sheath was removed. The catheter was flushed. A
final chest x-ray was obtained. The film demonstrated the tip in
the superior vena cava. The line is ready for use. A StatLock
was applied and the line was hep-locked.

IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 38-cm PICC line into the
right basilic vein extending with the tip in the SVC.

Title: REPEAT VIDEO SWALLOW EVALUATION
OROPHARYNGEAL VIDEOFLUOROSCOPIC SWALLOWING EVALUATION

EVALUATION:
An oral and pharyngeal swallowing videofluoroscopy was performed
today in collaboration with Radiology.  Thin liquid,
Nectar-thick
liquid, pureed consistency barium, and one quarter ground cookie
coated with barium were administered. Results follow:

ORAL PHASE:
Bolus formation and bolus control were moderately impaired with
significantly prolonged mastication and oral residue after a [**12-29**]
of a ground cookie. Pt was also noted to have premature
spillover
with both thin liquids to the level of the pyriform sinuses and
to the valleculae with nectar thick liquids. AP tongue movement
was moderately impaired with prolonged oral transit time. Pt had
a moderate amount of oral residue after all consistencies tried.

PHARYNGEAL PHASE:
Swallow initiation was timely and wfl. No nasal regurgitation
was
appreciated during this study, but velar elevation was still
mildly reduced. Laryngeal elevation was mildly reduced with
reduced base of tongue retraction, resulting in moderate amount
of residue in the valleculae (solids > liquids), although
slightly improved since the last study. Pt did have less residue
in the pyriform sinuses with only a trace amount noted during
today's study. Pt also had decreased laryngeal valve closure,
with one episode of premature opening of the vestibule and vocal
cords resulting in aspiration. Pt was also noted to have absent
epiglottic deflection. Pharyngeal transit time was mildly
reduced
with moderately impaired bolus propulsion.

ASPIRATION/PENETRATION:
Pt had penetration of both thin and nectar thick liquids before
and during the swallow from premature spillover. Pt had one
episode of penetration before the swallow with a tsp of thin
liquid. Pt intermittently cleared the penetration during the
swallow, but pt was not sensate to the material.

Pt also had trace to mild amounts of aspiration with both thin
and nectar thick liquids during and after the swallow.
Aspiration
during the swallow was secondary to premature spilover and
uncle[**Name (NI) **] penetration as well as decreased laryngeal valve
closure with the pt opening the vestibule and vocal cords prior
to the completion of the swallow. Aspiration was greatest when
the pt drank from the straw. Aspiration after the swallow was
due
pharyngeal residue and uncle[**Name (NI) **] penetration in the laryngeal
vestibule dripping below the level of the cords.

While pt did have throat clearing and occasional spontaneous
coughing during the study, it was not correlated to aspiration r
penetration. All episodes of aspiration and penetration were
silent, without throat clearing or coughing. Cued coughs were
effective when pt could cough immediately after the swallow, but
pt had difficulty doing this independently secondary to his MS.

TREATMENT TECHNIQUES:
Swallow-cough-swallow was effective when pt was cued to cough
immediately after the swallow, but pt could not do this
independently secondary to MS. If pt did not cough immediately
after the swallow, this technique was not effective at clearing
the aspiration.

The chin tuck and repeat swallows did not reduce the
penetration/aspiration or reduce the amount of pharyngeal
residue.

SUMMARY:
Pt continues to present with a moderate oral-pharyngeal
dysphagia
with minimal improvements in pharyngeal constriction and amount
of pharyngeal residue, particuarly in the pyriform sinuses,
since
the last evaluation. Pt continues to have trace-mild amounts of
aspiration with both thin and nectar thick liquids, noted to
increase secondary to [**Name (NI) 57714**] throughout the study. Pt has less
residue with thin liquids, and was noted to have slightly less
aspiration after the swallow with thin liquids. If pt has 1:1
supervision during theraputic feeding trials to cue him to cough
and swallow again immediately after the swallow, he can clear
the
aspirate material. Given his MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 57714**] over time with
increased aspiration, pt is not appropriate to take full meals
by
mouth and is only appropriate for small amounts during
structured
therapy sessions.

At this point, pt should remain on the NG tube, but can take
small amounts of ice chips until then.  Once d/c'd to rehab, pt
can begin trials of thin liquids and pureed consistency solids
only with a spee
