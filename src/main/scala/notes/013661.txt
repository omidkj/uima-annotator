Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
ICH


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 79 year-old right-handed F who underwent VP
shunt revision yesterday as an outpatient procedure who presents
with R-sided weakness, slurred speech, N/V and progressive loss
of consciousness throughout the day today. She was discharged
well yesterday but found by VNS today around 11am to have slight
R facial droop, slurred speech and was complaining of dizziness.
She was taken to [**Hospital1 1474**], where she was found to be
hypertensive
to 230/130 by their records. There, she became progressively
more
unresponsive to the point of coma and had N/V. She was intubated
at 12:20pm and paralyzed (it is now 3pm at the time of my
evaluation) and loaded with dilantin IV and transferred here
after Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was consulted. His concern was for subdural
hematoma; subsequent head CT prior to transfer showed a
brainstem
bleed.

Her subsequent course has been complicated by hypotension to the
70s-80s systolic and dilantin has been discontinued. With
dopamine drip here, sbp has risen to 100s.

The pt was unable to offer a history at the time of my
encounter.
Therefore, the following history is per the primary team, the
medical record.

The pt was unable to offer a review of systems.

NEURO
MS
Does not open eyes to verbal or noxious stimuli. No verbal
output. Does not follow commands. Does not blink to questions.

CN
Pupil 1.5->1mm on the left, slightly larger on the right and
midline. Funduscopic exam revealed no papilledema, exudates, or
hemorrhages. There is no horizontal or vertical movement in
either direction to oculocephalic maneuver. Corneal reflex
absent
on the left and present on the right but nasal tickle absent
bilaterally. No overt facial asymmetry but she keeps her eyes
and
mouth open, raising the possibility of bifacial weakness. Gag
reflex absent. Not breathing over the vent settings

MOTOR
Increased tone in the legs. To noxious stimuli in the right arm,
she has stereotyped internal rotation; she withdraws a bit
purposefully in the left arm. In the legs, to noxious stimuli,
there is triple flexion. No spontaneous or purposeful activity.
No adventitious movements noted. No asterixis noted. No
myoclonus
noted.

SENSORY
No grimace to noxious stimuli

NCHCT: Acute hemorrhage, likely hypertensive in etiology,
centered in
the pons, with extension into fourth and third ventricles and
subarachnoid space. There has been slight interval progression
since the OSH study, done two hours earlier. Given the presence
of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, no definite obstructive
hydrocephalus is seen.

CXR:
1) ET tube with tip 2.3 cm from the carina for which retraction
could be
considered.

2) Fluffy opacification of the left lung could represent an
early pneumonia or aspiration.


Brief Hospital Course:
Given the poor prognosis (due to the location of the bleed, her
age and
blood in the fourth ventricle), an extensive discussion was
undertaken with the family regarding the direction of care.  The
team spoke at length with the patient's daughter, [**Name (NI) **],
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 55511**]. She expressed a clear desire on her mother's part
not to have heroic measures to sustain her. As the HCP, she
expressed the wish to make her mother DNR. Supportive measures
were maintained until other family members could arrive from out
of town.  When family arrived, the patient was extubated and cmo
measures were put in place.  The patient died shortly thereafter
on the day following admission.
