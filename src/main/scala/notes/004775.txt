Brief Hospital Course:
# GI Bleed: Hemodynamically stable at presentation. He had 2
large bore peripheral IV's and 4 units were typed and screened.
he was laced on protonix IV BID. His coumadin as his risk of GI
bleeding was thought to be more acute than risk of embolic
stroke given [**Country **] score of 2.  Tamsulosin was held as well to
minimize dampening of blood pressure response. Patient refused
EGD/Colonoscopy/NG tube. Bleeding thought to be likely slow UGIB
(h/o jejunal avm's) rather than diverticular bleed given h/o
melana with out hematochezia. Received 2u prbc's overnight, with
Hct increase 21 to 26 by the morning. He received another unit
of blood on [**12-6**].  GI visited patient but patient refused any
invasive interventions and was transferred to the floor.

At that point the patient decided that he did not want any more
blood products, and was comfortable with the possibility of
dying if his bleeding were to continue. He was given 1.25 mg of
vitamin K and watched for 24 hours; fortunately, his HCT
remained stable over night, and he was discharged to home off
warfarin pending outpatient follow-up.
