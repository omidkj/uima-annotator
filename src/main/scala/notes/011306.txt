Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
Pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
this patient is a 63 y/o M w/ PMHx of HIV (last CD4 150 per
patient), HCV ?c/b variceal bleed, osteomyelitis s/p L BKA who
is presenting with fevers. Pt reports that he was in his USOH
until 2 days ago, when he developed dry cough, fevers, fatigue.
Tm at home 101.3. Also endorses NS, LOA, dyspnea, nausea. Pt
also reports some back pain earlier, but this has resolved. Of
note, the patient reports having recent sick contacts; two
friends with PNA.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 100.4 93 134/53 25 93%. Labs were
significant for Hct of 23.7, platelets of 94 (pt's baseline labs
unavailable). Lactate was 1.3. CXR revealed LLL consolidation.
Pt was started on CTX/azithro for CAP treatment and admitted to
medicine for further management (no concern for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 17739**]).

.
On the medicine floor patient developed hypotension (110s to
70s), HR down to 50s and noted to be less resonsive with fever
to 101.
Given concern for sepsis, he was broadened to
vanc/zosyn/azithro. ABG showed 7.48/33/76, but 98% on RA during
this episode. CT obtained and showed bilateral multifocal
regions of ground-glass opacification within the lungs
suggestive of underlying infection or aspiration with no large
area of pneumonic consolidation identified. ID consulted, adding
on urine legionella and getting DFA. Patient has clinically
improved in ICU, blood pressures 110-120s, on room air, mental
status felt to be at baseline.
.
Also during MICU stay, hematocrit trended down from mid twenties
to 19. He was given 2u PRBC with improvemente of HCT to 26.
Hepatology consulted and recommend guiaic stools, continue PPI,
start TID iron. C. difficile negative.

CT CHEST:

IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral multifocal regions of ground-glass opacification
within the
lungs suggestive of underlying infection or aspiration with no
large area of pneumonic consolidation identified.

2. Cirrhotic appearance to the liver with likely sequelae of
portal
hypertension including splenomegaly with no evidence for
intra-abdominal
ascites or varices.

3. Two hypo-enhancing lesions are identified within the liver
which may
represent benign hemangiomas. This should be confirmed with a
liver
ultrasound.

4. Region of mural wall thickening noted in relation to the
cecal pole with a relatively normal terminal ileum and appendix
identifed. There is surrounded peri-cecal stranding.
Differential diagnosis would include typhlitis in the setting of
an immunocompromised host. Other etiologies would include
inflammatory bowel disease or other infectious etiologies.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: This is a 63 M w/ PMHx of HIV (last CD4 150
per patient) who was admitted with fever and radiographic
evidence of multifocal pneumonia, requiring MICU transfer for
hypotension concerning for sepsis, now hemodynamically stable
and clinically improving on IV antibiotics with hospital course
also complicated by hematocrit drop requiring PRBC transfusion
.
#COMMUNITY ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA: The patient was admitted with
fever found to have radiographic evidence of pneumonia (CXR w/
LLL infiltrate and then CT chest with multi-focal). He was
initially treated with ceftriaxone/azithromycin. Soon after
admission the patient developed hypotension, which was fluid
responsive and his antibiotic coverage was broadened to
vanc/zosyn.  Over the next 48 hours he remained afebrile and
hemodynamically stable so he was changed back to ceftriaxone and
azithromycin. In consultation with infectious disease, he will
complete a 13 day course of antibiotics, with plan at discharge
of one week of cefpodoxime /azithromycin.
.
#HYPOTENSION: The etiology was likely chronic low blood pressure
due to chirrhosis superimposed with acute volume depletion from
hematocrit drop and dehydration in setting of fever. This
rapidly corrected with IV fluid administration and packed red
blood cells. Blood cultures no growth on discharge.
.
#HIV: He was continued on
Abacavir/Lamivudine/Tenofovir/Efavirenz wtih PCP prophylaxis
with [**Name9 (PRE) 110660**] and fungal prophylaxis with fluconazole. He
will f/u with infectious disease in 1 month for continued HIV
care.
.
#IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA: The baseline is not clear although
requires several transfusions per year per patient. His
hematocrit trended down, necessitating pRBC transfusion.  GI
evaluated the patient given concern for GI bleed. There was no
evidence of GI bleed so patient did not get endoscopy. His
hematocrit remained stable. He was started on iron with
recommendation for colonoscopy if has not recently been done. He
was continued on omeprazole.
.
#HEPATITIS B and C: Hepatitis C and B viral loads were sent and
were pending at discharge. Will need outpatient hepatology
follow up when relocates to MA.
.
#CHRONIC PAIN: Will continue home suboxone
.
#CECAL THICKENING: This was incidently found on imaging although
the patient had no GI symptoms, C. diff negative..
.
Patient planning on going back to [**State 760**] and eventually
relocating to MA in the near future. Offered to assist to find
new PCP but pt prefers to find own PCP at later date.
Recommended f/u with his PCP in NJ in one week time.
