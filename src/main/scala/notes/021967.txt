Mr. [**Known lastname 37455**] is a white male, who was admitted to the operating
room on [**2180-12-14**], where he underwent a left modified radical
neck dissection for squamous cell carcinoma of the left neck.
He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with two

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In the immediate postoperative period, his
vital signs were stable.  He had no significant fever,
although he was slow to extubate.  He remained intubated
overnight and then the following morning, he was still
somewhat lethargic.  He remained intubated another 24 hours
and actually extubated himself, without difficulty.  The
patient tolerated extubation well.  [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] output
continued to reduce slowly.

The patient was on normal postoperative incisional care and
was started immediately on p.o. liquids which he tolerated
well. This was advanced to normal diet.  The drains were
finally discontinued on [**2180-12-29**] as the serous output
continued to reduce.  The patient was taken p.o. well at this
time and was ambulating normally.  The patient was discharged
home with one week follow-up.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Normal wound care was initiated.
