History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 112326**] is a 47yo woman with HCV cirrhosis, emphysema,
heroin IVDU, who was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 112327**] for septic
shock, MSSA MV endocarditis ([**2168-6-16**]) c/b septic emboli to the
brain, spleen, kidneys, and digits (w necrosis of distal
extremities). Course was complicated by Klebsiella HCAP (sp 8d
Levofloxacin; BAL on [**6-23**] also showed 2+ budding yeast), [**Last Name (un) **] (Cr
1.1 --> 3.1), E. coli UTI (Dx: [**2168-6-16**]; sp 7d ciprofloxacin) and
[**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29361**]/glabarta peritonitis (Dx [**2168-6-30**]; sp
Micafungin and Flagyl). Pt was not CT [**Doctor First Name **] candidate as per CT
team (TEE on [**6-21**] showed MV vegetation: 2.4x1.4cm and on [**6-30**]
showed MV vegetation, measuring 1.3 cm x 0.9 cm). Pt was treated
with vanc and later discharged on nafcillin (day 1 [**6-17**] - [**7-29**]).

Pt presented again on [**7-18**] s/p unwitnessed fall w/ neck pain. In
[**Name (NI) **], pt was found to be febrile (102.3), tachycardic (120-140s),
SOB w O2 Sat to 90s on 3LNC. Exam was notable for being
combative and agitated, and [**2-23**] pansystolic murmur best heard
over the apex, and slight diffuse abdominal tenderness.
Extremities were still notable for necrotic fingers and feet
with 2+ pulses
bilaterally. In ED, CT Head was negative, CT spine showed
possible C5-6
diskitis (focal endplate irregularities and sclerosis), CXR
showed bl hazy opacities, and CTA chest showed lingular nodule
and multiple nodularities w fluid overload pattern and NO PE.
Echo [**2168-8-2**] showed a moderate-sized vegetation on the mitral
valve (posterior leaflet) and severe (4+) mitral regurgitation.
Csurg was reconsulted for evaluation for mitral valve
replacement.

Past Medical History:
Recent ICU admission for MSSA endocarditis, c/b septic shock,
respiratory failure, pneumonia, ATN, hand/foot necrosis, fungal
peritonitis, UTI, Hep. C not treated(being followed at [**Hospital1 2177**]),
Asthma, Vit. D deficiency, Asthma, Emphysema


Social History:

patient's polysubstance abuse. Pt actively using heroin, MJ, BZ,
cocaine, before last admission. Approximately 35 pack year
smoking hx. Two sons (24, 16). Two grandchildren

Pertinent Results:
[**7-31**] MRI head
1.Evolution of multiple abnormal FLAIR foci, in keeping with
infarcts,
throughout the brain parenchyma with some of them demonstrating
more apparent
hemorrhagic components.  Different degrees of decreased FLAIR
intensity
involving some of the multiple infarcts.  No evidence of acute
infarct.
2. The area of concern corresponds to expected evolution of a
focal infarct within the left cerebellum. No evidence of
abnormal enhancement.

[**2168-7-29**] CT torso
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  Worsening of the bilateral nodular pulmonary densities, most
likely
infectious versus inflammatory in nature.  These should be
followed with
repeat CT when the patient's current clinical scenario improves
to assure
complete resolution.  There is also worsening of the lower lobe
atelectasis
and consolidations as well as worsening of the mediastinal
lymphadenopathy.
Pulmonary edema is similar in extent.
3.  Stable splenic and renal infarcts.
4.  Thrombosed right external iliac artery, an unchanged
finding.
5.  Increased size of a left adnexal cyst. If patient is
postmenopausal then further evaluation is recommended with
pelvic ultrasound on a nonurgent basis (within 6 weeks).

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST [**2168-7-22**]:
Included views of the lung bases demonstrate small basilar
consolidations,
mild interstitial edema, moderate emphysema, and multiple
scattered
ground-glass nodular opacities, all improved since the [**2168-7-18**] chest CT examination.  Small left pleural effusion.  The
heart size is normal.  There is no pericardial effusion.
Relative hypodensity of the blood pool with respect to the
intraventricular septum (2:6) is compatible with chronic anemia.

There has been interval resolution of previously-seen ascites.
The liver
contour is nodular, most compatible with cirrhosis.  The spleen
is mildly
enlarged and contains a splenic infarct in the lateral upper
pole (2:12).  The pancreas, adrenal glands, stomach, and
intra-abdominal loops of small bowel are normal.  A gastrostomy
tube is appropriately positioned (2:31).
Relative hypodensity of the superior spleen (2:14) and along the
right renal cortex (2:29. 27) are better appreciated on the
contrast-enhanced study from [**2168-6-29**], reflecting infarcts.

Scattered prominent para-aortic lymph nodes (2:32) are slightly
enlarged since the [**2168-6-29**] examination.

ECHO REPORT [**2168-7-19**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is a moderate-sized vegetation on the mitral
valve. There is an abscess cavity seen adjacent to the mitral
valve (not as well seen as on the prior transesophageal
echocardiogram). Moderate to severe (3+) to severe (4+)
eccentric mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior transesophageal study (images reviewed)
of [**2168-6-30**], the mitral vegetation now appears smaller. Mitral
regurgitation appears similar to slightly worse (severity of
mitral regurgitation was likely underestimated in the prior
report). An abscess/phlegmon is seen along the posterolateral
annulus (though not as well seen as on the prior transesophageal
echocardiogram).

[**2168-8-12**]
PRE BYPASS No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right
atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] There is an echolucent area
in the basal lateral and anterlateral walls, below the posterior
mitral annulus, that demonstrates blood flow within. This is
likely an aneurysm due to abscess. The right ventricle appears
to dispaly focal hypokinesis of the apical
