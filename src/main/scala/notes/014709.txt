History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 75012**] is a 78yo M with history of CAD s/p CABG, CHF EF 23%
on recent MIBI (no recent echo here), AAA s/p repair [**2114**] who
presents with weakness and inability to urinate for 3 days.
Patient says he had IV contrast dye load 2-3 weeks ago to eval
his AAA and his abd pain. Since then, he has had "urinary
retention" with some decreased voiding. He was initially
evaluated at an OSH ED and found to have relative hypotension
with SBP 70 initially, then decreased to 64 --> 102 with 2 L
IVFs. CXR there was without failure, and a Foley was placed with
return of 400cc of urine with negative U/A. His baseline
creatinine was reportedly 1.2 with elevation to 5 on OSH labs.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.3, 87, 85/45, 18, 100% 2L.
Patient explained that his SBP at baseline was 80s-90s and was
mentating well. His exam was remarkable for RUQ tenderness. He
had a complete abdominal ultrasound which showed no evidence of
AAA leak, bilateral renal cysts without hydronephrosis and
cholelithiasis without signs of cholecystitis. Labs showed
lactate of 1.0 with normal WBC, and hematocrit of 24. He was
guaiac negative on rectal but had a brown, formed guaiac
positive stool. Bedside FAST exam was negative and CXR showed
volume overload. He received vancomycin, zosyn, tylenol and
lasix 20mg. Patient was started on low dose levophed when his
MAPs fell into the 40s with SBP 79/43. He made an additional
200cc of urine in our ED for total 600cc since Foley placement
and total of 4L IVF. Vitals on transfer were 101.4 (rectal), 69,
97/39, 18, 100% 2L NC.
.
In the MICU, he complains of R groin pain and feeling thirsty.
He has had a 30 pound weight loss over the past couple months
(which he says was partially voluntary) but denies night sweats.
He frequently feels chilled but no subjective fevers. He was
recently hospitalized at [**Hospital1 3278**] last week for cardiac cath that
he says "went wrong." He has had a month of poor PO intake,
nausea, intermittent vomiting and occasional dysphagia. His DOE
is slightly worse than usual (walks 175 ft instead of 200 ft)
but no frank CP or SOB at rest. He had some increased urinary
hesitency and dribbling earlier in the week but no urine output
for the past 3 days. No dysuria or hematuria. He has occasional
constipation.
.

[**2125-6-26**] portable CXR IMPRESSION:
1. Bibasilar linear opacities, probable atelectasis.
2. Focal linear opacity in the right mid lung of uncertain
etiology.
Recommend dedicated chest CT non-emergently for further
evaluation.
3. Mild cardiomegaly.
.
[**2125-6-26**] abd US IMPRESSION:
1. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
2. No hydronephrosis or suspicious renal mass. Multiple simple
renal cysts.
3. Normal-caliber abdominal aorta without evidence of dilatation
or rupture.
.
[**2125-6-27**] TTE  IMPRESSION: Moderate left ventricular cavity
dilatation with moderate to severe systolic dysfunction with
aneurysmal inferior wall c/w multivessel coronary artery
disease. At least moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
[**2125-6-30**] CXR
ETT tube is slightly high at the level the clavicles, can be
advanced couple of centimeters for more standard position. NG
tube tip is in the stomach. Sternal wires are aligned. Patient
is status post CABG. There is no pneumothorax. The right lateral
hemithorax was not included on the film.
Cardiomegaly is stable. Mild vascular congestion has improved,
slightly
asymmetric, worse on the right side. Probably small right
pleural effusion is present. Aeration of the right lower lobe
has improved.
.
[**2125-7-1**] CXR
An ET tube is present, the tip lies at the upper edge of the
clavicles,
approximately 6.4 cm above the carina. Clinical correlation
regarding
advancement is requested. An NG tube is present, tip extending
beneath
diaphragm overlying stomach. An additional line overlies the
right
mediastinum, but this appears to extend outside the patient --
clinical
correlation is requested.
.
The patient is status post sternotomy with mediastinal clips.
There is
moderate- to moderately-severe cardiomegaly. There is upper zone

redistribution, with vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.
There are
small-to-moderate bilateral effusions, with underlying collapse
and/or
consolidation. Compared with [**2125-6-30**] at 4:56 a.m., the effusions
and some of the bibasilar collapse/consolidation is new. The CHF
findings are similar, possibly slightly worse.
.
[**2125-7-2**] CXR
Moderate right and mild left pleural effusions with atelectasis
of adjacent lung is unchanged. Large cardiomegaly with mild
vascular engorgement, however no definite evidence of pulmonary
edema. Post sternotomy status and chronic rib fractures are
unchanged.
.
[**2125-7-9**] CXR
In comparison with the study of [**7-4**], there has been placement
of
an ICD device with leads in the region of the right atrium and
apex of the
right ventricle. No evidence of pneumothorax. The bibasilar
opacifications
consistent with atelectasis and effusion have decreased since
the prior study.
.
[**2125-7-10**] CXR
In comparison with study of [**7-9**], there is no change in the
