CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mental status changes.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 48-year-old
male with a history of type I diabetes diagnosed at age 15,
coronary artery disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia
and peripheral vascular disease, who is now status post renal
and pancreas transplant, who was brought to an outside
hospital, [**Hospital6 3105**], for mental status
changes.  The patient was in his usual state of health until
[**1-27**] when he first noted symptoms of upper respiratory
infection.  He complained of cough without sputum production
at the time.  He denied fevers or chills and shortness of
breath.  He did complain of a constant feeling of a very
low-grade chest discomfort substernally, possibly due to the
cough.  The patient denied any associated shortness of
breath, nausea, vomiting and diaphoresis.  He had no
exacerbating or alleviating factors.

The patient stated that there was no change in his chest
discomfort when he was exercising or with a change in
position.  The patient also complained of headache in the few
days prior to admission.  For this headache he took about 12
Aspirin on [**2104-1-27**].  He was also not taking in
fluids or food very well.  He had a decreased appetite.  He
also had some diarrhea in the last week prior to admission
with multiple episodes of watery bowel movements likely
secondary to Lactulose that the patient takes for
constipation.  The patient also stated that he became
somewhat confused and was not taking his medications,
including his Bicitra.  The patient awoke on [**1-29**] and
was very lethargic and was stumbling.  EMTs were called by
family members who recorded a blood pressure of 160/80, and
the patient was given a 1.5 L of intravenous fluids, a dose
of Levaquin for a urinary tract infection and Bicarb IV for a
pH of 7.1.

The patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital6 649**] MICU where Levaquin was continued, and
intravenous Bicarb was continued.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Diabetes mellitus type I diagnosed
at age 15.  2.  Coronary artery disease, with known

vascular disease status post right femoral distal in [**2097**] and
a left femoral-popliteal and a left femoral distal in [**2096**].

resection of prostate times two.  15.  Status post
appendectomy.

is a cigar smoker, three a day.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He stated that he was exposed to a virus,
as children had upper respiratory infections in the days
prior to his admission.  He denied sore throat, ear pain or
facial tenderness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.4??????, blood
pressure 156/76, heart rate 68, respirations 20, oxygen
saturation 100% on room air.  General:  The patient was alert
and oriented times three.  He was lying comfortably in bed.
He was conversive.  He was in no apparent distress after
transfer from the [**Hospital6 256**] MICU.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Right pupil post
surgical.  Left round and reactive to light.  Oropharynx
moist and pink.  The patient had partial dentures.  Neck:
Flat JVP.  Supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular:
Regular, rate and rhythm.  There was a systolic murmur at the
right upper sternal border to the carotids, 3 out of 6, and a
systolic murmur, 2 out of 6, at the left lower sternal border
to the axilla.  Pulmonary:  There was diffuse rhonchi.  No
wheezes and no rales and no crackles.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds.  There
was a midline scar bruit over the left lower quadrant.

LABORATORY DATA:  From the outside hospital, white count was
11.9, hematocrit 53.1, platelet count 152,000, differential
with 90 neutrophils, 2 bands, 4 lymphs; troponin 0.1, CK 65,
MB fraction 10; urinalysis had greater than 100 white cells,
2+ bacteria, [**4-17**] epithelial cells; CHEM7 was remarkable for
potassium of 6.1, bicarb 9, BUN 134, creatinine 5.3; ABG with
a pH of 7.19, pCO2 19.

Laboratories from the [**Hospital6 256**] on
[**1-29**] on admission to the MICU revealed a hematocrit of
44, white count 5.2; bicarb 9, creatinine 3.5, BUN 98,
potassium 4.9; repeat urinalysis was negative for white
cells; LFTs were normal, phosphorus 4.8; CKs initially were
320 and peaked at 292, the MB fraction was 53, and the index
was 18, the troponin at that time was greater than 50.  On
serial CKs, the index came down to 11, and the troponin came
down to 16.

Electrocardiogram showed regular rhythm, normal sinus, 80
beats per minute, T-wave inversions in the inferior leads,
Q-waves inferiorly, ST elevations 1 mm in lead III and 2 mm
elevations in V1-V3, T-wave inversions in I and II, V4-V6,
biphasic in III, AVF and V3.  He had small Q-waves laterally.
The catheterization in [**2102-11-8**] had a proximal total
occluded right coronary artery, mid left anterior descending
was 50% occluded, and the OM1 was 90% occluded.  All his
vessels were severely diseased.

Echocardiogram in [**2102-11-8**] showed an ejection fraction
of 20-25% with moderate left atrial enlargement, mild aortic
insufficiency, moderate mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid
regurgitation, and global hypokinesis with akinesis.

Chest x-ray on admission showed mild left ventricular
enlargement, no acute process, no failure, no infiltrate.
Repeat chest x-ray on [**2-5**] showed a small possible
early pneumonia in the posterior segment of the left lower
lobe seen on the lateral view.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This patient is a 48-year-old male with
type I diabetes status post renal and pancreas transplant,
coronary artery disease, three-vessel disease, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, peripheral vascular disease, who was
admitted for mental status changes related metabolic
acidosis.  It is likely that this metabolic acidosis occurred
because the patient was not replenishing his bicarbs since he
loses through his bladder.  His pancreas transplant is
connected to his bladder and therefore wastes bicarb.  He was
also very dehydrated and had worsening renal function
secondary to dehydration, as well as excessive NSAID use.  He
suffered from demand ischemia causing his cardiac enzymes to
rise.

Cardiovascular:  The patient ruled in for myocardial
infarction likely demand ischemia instead of a
