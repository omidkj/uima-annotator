Service:  MICU-TULLI

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 88 year old gentleman
with a history of ETOH requiring chronic Foley catheter, also
with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, congestive heart
failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, coronary artery
disease, who presents with complaints of pain in his penis
after a Foley catheter was changed and performed in the
Emergency Department today.  He had a difficult Foley
catheter placement on the day prior to admission and pain
around the Foley catheter placement necessitating return to
the Emergency Department for pain management and Foley
catheter bleeding.  Since arrival to the Emergency
Department, the patient was complaining of nausea, had
vomiting times one.  A KUB and a chest x-ray were performed
to rule out bowel perforation, read as normal with no
perforations.

The patient became progressively hypotensive to the 80s over
40s and required 1200 cc of normal saline intravenous fluid
bolus to which his blood pressure responded.  The Medical
Intensive Care Unit was then called to evaluate for sepsis
protocol and the blood pressure was 116/60.  On evaluation,
temperature was 97.0 F.; white blood cell count was 18.7,
lactate was 3.1.

Medicines given in the Emergency Department were morphine
sulfate 2 mg intravenously times one and Rocephin one gram
intravenously times one.

ALLERGIES:   Include clindamycin which causes elevated liver

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lived at the [**Hospital **] nursing home.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission was temperature 97.0 F.;
blood pressure 100/55 to 116/60; pulse 81 to 72; respiratory
rate 18 to 14; O2 is 95 to 97% on room air.  In general, he
was chronically ill appearing male in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Sclerae were anicteric.  Pupils with right surgical
reactive, left mildly reactive.  Mucous membranes were moist.
Neck was supple.  Chest was with decreased air movement but
no wheezes, rales or rhonchi.  Cardiovascular was regular
rate and rhythm, S1, S2, positive S3 and S4.  Abdomen was
soft, nontender, nondistended with positive bowel sounds.
Extremities with positive left lower extremity with ulcer; no
erythema.  Chronic venous stasis changes.  Rectal examination
was heme negative.  Stool was moderately firm at the vault.
Neurologic examination was awake, alert and oriented times
three.

LABORATORY:  Labs on admission were notable for a white blood
cell count of 22,000, which was 89% neutrophils, hematocrit
of 39.2, platelets of 448, INR of 3.3, bicarbonate of 21, BUN
and creatinine of 75 and 2.2.

Urinalysis which was notable for large blood, 100 protein,
moderate leukocyte esterase, greater than 50 red blood cells.
Chest x-ray with no acute changes.

KUB with a large amount of stool.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 88 year old gentleman with a
complicated medical history including benign prostatic
hypertrophy, coronary artery disease, congestive heart
failure, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, who presents
after a traumatic Foley catheter placement with severe pain,
now with leukocytosis and hypotension, and hematuria.

1.  HYPOTENSION:  Although the patient was worked up
including the sepsis protocol, it was likely secondary to
intravenous narcotics.  The patient responded after a fluid
bolus and otherwise blood pressure remained stable throughout
the course of his stay.  The patient's blood pressure
medicines were initially held secondary to hypotension but
then restarted as his blood pressure remained stable.

2.  BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY STATUS POST TRANSURETHRAL
RESECTION OF THE PROSTATE AND WITH NOW HEMATURIA:  The
patient had a traumatic Foley catheter placement on the [**8-8**] and in the Emergency Room had a clean bladder
irrigation which showed evidence of clots in his bladder, but
responded to irrigation.  Eventually, the Foley catheter was
reinserted.  On the 19th the patient was continued to
irrigate, responded and continued to have minimal amounts of
blood in his urine but had decreased pain and was otherwise
stable.  Urology was following the patient and the patient's
hematocrit and hematuria remained stable throughout the
course of his stay.

3.  LEUKOCYTOSIS:  Unsure of the source; initially at 22,000
on admission with 89% neutrophils.  Unsure of source of
infection.  Urinalysis did have evidence of leukocyte
esterase although had been on antibiotics, so patient had
urine culture sent which was consistent with mixed bacterial
flora consistent with fecal contamination.  The patient was
started on ceftazidime 2 grams q. day and is to complete a
seven day course.  The patient's antibiotics were started on
the 19th and at the time of discharge will be day four of day
seven to complete a seven day course.  No different access
was needed as the patient continued to receive his
antibiotics through peripheral access at the nursing home.

Otherwise, the patient remained afebrile throughout the
course of his stay and his white blood cell count continued
to decline on treatment and on day prior to discharge had a
white blood cell count of 12.5.

4.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:   The patient with an ejection
fraction of 25 to 30% in [**Month (only) 205**] but no evidence of fluid
overload.  On this hospitalization, his initial
anti-hypertensives and diuretics were held secondary to
hypotension.  When hypotension stabilized, the patient
tolerated his cardiac regimen without difficulty.

5.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  The patient remained in regular
rhythm throughout the course of his stay and otherwise was
stable.  The patient was continued on his digoxin and
amiodarone and then restarted on his Toprol and beta blocker
and otherwise was stable in terms of an atrial fibrillation
standpoint.

6.  CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  For the patient's chronic renal
failure, the patient's baseline creatinine was from 2.4 to
2.5 and was at baseline and remained at baseline through the
course of his stay.  His medicines were continued to be
renally dosed.

7.  INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS:  For the patient's
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, the patient had finger
stick and was on an American Diabetic Association diet and
maintained on a 70/30 regimen with sliding scale in between.
The patient's blood sugars remained stable, however, did drop
slightly while he was NPO; however, the patient's
fingerstick and blood sugars remained stable throughout the
course of his stay and will continue on his same outpatient
regimen.

8.  NAUSEA AND VOMITING;  Unsure of source; ruled out for
obstruction with a KUB.  The patient's nausea and vomiting
improved after a large bowel movement and constipation
resolved.  [**Month (only) 116**] have been complication from pain; otherwise
the patient will follow-up with the Gastroenterologist for a
sigmoidoscopy as an outpatient.  The patient has the
appointment already scheduled.

9.  HYPOTHYROIDISM:  Remains stable on his home regimen of
Levoxyl 100 mg q. day.

10. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient's coronary artery
disease remains stable on aspirin and beta blocker and
otherwise no issues during the course of this admission.

11. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONAR
