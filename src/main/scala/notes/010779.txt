Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 26F with history of depression, PTSD,
borderline personality; admit with large ASA overdose.
.
# ASA overdose: Pt reports taking 250 325mg tablets = 80grams.
Became obtunded upon arrival to MICU, which improved with
subsequent agitation. Need for dialysis given very high levels
(>100). HD line placed and pt dialyzed x1. Pt required
intubation for airway protection and was hyperventilated to
avoid acidemia in setting of asa overdose. Maintained on sodium
bicarb until ASA level nondetectable on [**2152-9-25**], at which point
sodium bicarb fluids d/c'ed.  Patient self-extubated. Acid-base
disorder stabilized.
.
# Anemia: Pt had a HCT trend down to 23 in the ICU, with BRBPR
and hard stools.  GI conult felt due to ASA gastritis vs
hemorroidal bleed mostly. She gives a history consistent with
GERD. Was tranfused 1U x PRBC, HCT to 28 --> 30.  She is on PPI
prophylaxis given gastritis potential for ASA and h/o consistent
with GERD.  An outpatient EGD was recommended to evaluate for
Barrett's.
.
# Hypotension/tachycardia. Following intubation. ?meds vs.
positive pressure ventilation vs. infection vs. hypovolemia vs
just effects from overdose itself. Briefly required
phenylephrine, however, this quickly resolved and BP is stable
off of pressors or support.   Patient has baseline BP in the 90s
w/o symtpoms, and this was documented in recent otpt PCP visit
[**2152-8-5**].
.
# Fever. Resolved. Likely [**2-7**] overdose. Also concerned for
infection. She was apyrexic when discharged from ICU and not on
antibiotics and with no signs of active infection at this time.
.
# Suicidal attempt. Long history of depression and SI/suicidal
behavior with multiple attempts in the past (drug overdose,
cutting, swalling glass). Psychiatry is following. On 1:1
sitter.  Currently back on home psych meds, pending transfer to
inpatient facility. Patient medically stable and cleared to go
to psych facility.

# Mild liver injury - resolving.  Mildly elevate INR, AST, LDH
trending down. Normal to elevated fibrinogen (acute phase
reactant), normal haptoglobin (not low) do not suggest
hemolysis. This likely related to ingestion event and should be
self limited.
