DIAGNOSIS:
Skin and subcutaneous tissue, right leg (A-P):

1.Skin and subcutaneous tissue with fibrosis, acute and chronic
inflammation, focal necrosis, focal calcification, and foreign
body giant cell reaction consistent with prior procedure /
treatment effect.
2.No sarcoma is identified.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2116-5-13**] 5:16 AM
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to preoperative [**2116-4-30**] chest
radiograph:

Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is comparable to the
preoperative appearance.
Opacification of the base of the left hemithorax is probably a
combination of
severe left lower lobe atelectasis and pleural effusion.  I do
not see
pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2116-5-14**] 4:16 AM
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung
volumes have
increased, likely reflecting improved ventilation.  There is
unchanged
borderline size of the cardiac silhouette but the diameter of
the vasculature
in the lungs has decreased, reflecting decrease in pulmonary
edema.  Moderate
atelectasis at the left lung bases.  No newly occurred
parenchymal opacities.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2116-5-15**] 4:09 AM
FINDINGS:
Mild and hazy opacities in right lower lung is either
atelectasias or
combination of small effusion and atelectasis, unchanged over
last 24 hours.
Pleural effusion if any is minimal on the left side and stable.
Mildly
increased retrocardiac density, reflecting atelectasis, is
similar.
