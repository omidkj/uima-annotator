PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Bilateral inguinal hernia.

ALLERGIES:  NKDA.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. x6 days, 1.25 mg p.o. q.d. x1
   day.
2. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Casodex 50 mg p.o. q.d.

8. Folate.
9. Synthroid 112 mcg p.o. q.d.
10.      Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate 62, blood pressure 119/60,
and 97 percent saturation on room air.  GENERAL:  Healthy
appearing.  HEENT:  No abnormalities.  HEART:  Irregular rate
and rhythm, 1-2/6 murmur.  LUNGS:  CTAP.  ABDOMEN:  No
masses, tenderness, hernias or ascites.  EXTREMITIES:
Peripheral pulses 2+, no edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2188-3-24**], the patient underwent a
segmental colectomy with takedown of the splenic flexure.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  The pathology
later came back as adenocarcinoma (low grade, well
differentiated) invading the submucosa only.  There were no
regional lymph node metastases out of 14 examined.
Postoperatively, the patient was noted to have a splinting
with low O2 saturations.  An epidural was placed and
afterwards the INR was found to be 1.7.  The patient,
therefore, received FFP bringing his INR down to 1.5.  The
patient received a total of 2 units of FFP.  Repeated
neurological exams on the patient showed that his
neurological function remained intact despite the elevated
INR.  The patient also received 1 unit of packed red blood
cells bringing his hematocrit up from 26.2 to 27.8.  The
patient was noted to have a postop fever to 101.2 degrees,
which was likely secondary to atelectasis since it was within
a day of the operation.  The patient also had up to 4-second
pauses of his heart immediately postop.  Electrophysiology
was consulted regarding the role of a pacer.  Because the
patient remained asymptomatic, and because the amount of
Lopressor given was slightly higher than his home dose of
atenolol, it was felt there was no indication for a pacer at
that time.  The patient was continued on tele monitoring
throughout his hospital course and had several other pauses
even after he was taken off of all beta-blockers.  However,
it was still felt by the end of the patient's stay that
because his pauses had been asymptomatic and had decreased
when the beta-blocker was discontinued that there was no
indication for a pacer on this admission.  He was therefore
advised on discharge to return if he should have any
dizziness or lightheadedness and to follow up with his
cardiologist.  An episode of bradycardia occurred on the
night of postop day 1 in the setting of nausea when the
patient got up and walked around.  The electrophysiology
fellow was consulted and felt that this decreased heart rate
was probably secondary to vagal stimulation due to abdominal
distention and an inability to pass flatus.  Again,
observation was determined to be the best course.  On postop
day 3, the patient was advanced to a clear diet.  However, he
woke in the middle of the night with some nausea and a repeat
bradycardia down to 38.  The patient was therefore returned
to a sips diet, and he was continued on telemetry with no
further intervention.  On postop day 5, as the patient's INR
had remained elevated at 1.9 despite stopping the Coumadin,
the patient was reversed with 4 units of FFP and the epidural
was pulled.  His INR dropped to 1.2 after receiving the 4
units of FFP.  The patient, however, had bright red blood per
rectum around that same time.  His hematocrit was 27.6.
Because of his cardiac condition, he was given 1 unit packed
red blood cells raising his hematocrit up to 31.6, 22 that
morning.  On postop day 6, the patient reported flatus and
was started on a full liquid diet and his IV was heplocked.
The patient was found to be somewhat nauseated, but was kept
on a full liquid diet.  The patient was also started on his
home Lasix dose.  On postop day 8, the patient continued to
complain of some nausea and his abdomen was mildly tympanic.
The patient was nevertheless advanced to a regular diet,
which by the following day, postop day 9, the patient had
tolerated without nausea.  He was started on his home dose of
warfarin and was ultimately discharged on his home dose with
his INR up to 1.3 the day prior to discharge.  On postop day
10, as the patient continued to do well, he was discharged
home.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISPOSITION:  Home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  In addition to the admitting diagnoses,
the patient is status post a left colectomy for adenomatous
polyp.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Warfarin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. x 6 days, 1.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. x
   1 day.
2. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Casodex 50 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Advair.
6. Folic acid.
7. Levoxyl 112 mcg p.o. q.d.
8. Aldactone 25 mg p.o. q.d.
9. Percocet 5 mg and 325 mg 1-2 tablets p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n.
10.      Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.


FOLLOWUP PLANS:  The patient is to call and schedule followup
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**11-16**] weeks.

The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on Wednesday,
