Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Ventricular tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Catheter ablation procedure, aborted


History of Present Illness:
69 year old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF
15%) s/p CABG in [**2107**], mitral valve repair, atrial fibrillation
s/p ICD, recurrent VT s/p two VT ablations (one at [**Hospital1 112**] in [**2107**],
another at [**Hospital1 1774**] [**11-29**]), presents with recurrent VT for possible
VT ablation.
.
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] approximately 6 weeks ago
for shortness of breath and acute renal failure and was found to
have ventricular tachycardia.  He was started on Dofetilide at
that time.  Since then he had recurrent VT and had VT ablation
was attempted at [**Hospital3 **] 11/[**2113**].  At that time he was
switched to sotalol.  On [**2114-1-15**] he experienced DOE, fatigue
for the last four day and left-sided chest tightness on the day
of presentation which was non-radiating. He presented to the
[**Hospital3 **] ED where he was found to be in Ventricular
Tachycardia, and to have a potassium of 6.0.  He was
electrically cardioverted, and treated for hyperkalemia with
calcium gluconate, sodium bicarb, kayexalate and magnesium.  He
has since been asymptomatic.  He was started on mexilitine 200
TID and lopressor 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Per report he had a recent
catheterization in the last two months, which showed patent
grafts but an occluded and unbypassed circumflex.  Also, EP
report from [**Hospital1 1774**] described an exit site from an
infero-posterior scar. He is transferred from the [**Hospital3 **]
ICU for consideration for VT ablation.
.
Patient reports that he has had a rough year overall, with
numerous hospitalizations.  He is currently able to walk a few
blocks without stopping, which has been the case for the last
year.  Overall, he has been quite fatigued lately, and is
getting tired of the recent frequent admissions.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or
calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain
at this time, dyspnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle
edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  He does use two
pillows to sleep at night and cannot lie flat.

STUDIES:
.
ECG on admission:
Artifact is present. Sinus rhythm. Ventricular ectopy. Left
bundle-branch
block. No previous tracing available for comparison.
.
ECG on discharge: Sinus rhythm. Intraventricular conduction
delay. Prolonged Q-T interval. Prolonged P-R interval. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2114-1-24**] no change.
.
Femoral Vascular U/S Right [**2114-1-17**]:
Right AV fistula between the common femoral artery and vein. The

area of communication is approximately 4 mm in length and 2 mm
in diameter.  The scan was observed in real time and the
findings demonstrated for the surgical team at the bedside.
.
Femoral Vascular U/S Left [**2114-1-18**]:
1. No dissection, pseudoaneurysm, or fistula identified in the
left groin.
2. Redemonstration of the right groin AV fistula.
.
CXR [**1-21**]:
The patient is after median sternotomy due to CABG. Cardiomegaly
is
prominent, at least moderate. The left-sided pacemaker
defibrillator lead
terminates in the expected location of the left ventricle.
External spacers
are also noted facing the left ventricle directly. There is
bilateral
perihilar vascular prominence with more prominent in the right
perihilar lower lobe opacities, findings may represent pulmonary
edema although developing infection would be another
possibility, close follow up is recommended. Small bilateral
pleural effusion is noted . The patient is after left upper
abdomen surgery. There is no pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
69 year old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy
(ejection fraction 15%) s/p CABG in [**2107**], mitral valve repair,
atrial fibrillation s/p ICD, recurrent ventricular tachycardia
s/p two ablations (one at [**Hospital6 **] in [**2107**], another
at [**Hospital1 1774**] [**11-29**]), presenting with recurrent ventricular
tachycardia for possible ablation.

# VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA: Secondary to prior infarction.
Finding has been refractory to multiple medications and two
prior VT ablations.  Patient has a history of amiodarone
pulmonary toxicity.  On admission, patient was on mexiletine and
metoprolol, which was continued.  He was started on quinidine
gluconate after attempted ablation that was complicated by left
external iliac dissection and thus aborted.  Patient went back
into ventricular tachycardia on [**1-18**], with multiple shocks from
his ICD, and was started on a lidocaine drip.  He was not
responsive to the medication initially, and was transferred to
the CCU for higher level care.  He was weaned off the lidocaine
drip and mexiletine was restarted.  He was kept sedated on
lorazepam every 4 hours PRN as well as standing clonazepam to
keep him calm after his numerous shocks while on the floor.  He
did quite well from a rhythm standpoint while in the CCU without
any further episodes of ICD firing and was transitio
