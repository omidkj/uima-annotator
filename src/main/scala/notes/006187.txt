History of Present Illness:
44 yo [**Male First Name (un) 4746**] w/PMHx sx for alcoholism, depression with suicide
attempt, and asthma presented to OSH on [**2111-7-8**] with severe back
pain radiating to the epigastric area with associated nausea,
diarrhea with black tarry stools, and hematuria. Patient states
he was in his USOH until Wednesday when he started having
abdominal pain and nausea, but that he waited until Saturday
when the symptoms worsened to present to the ER.
Patient states his last alcoholic drink ([**3-6**] drinks) was the
Friday prior, and the only medication he had been taking was
Tylenol PM. He denies any suicidal ideations, depression, but
notes difficulty with concentration, appetite, and insomnia. He
denies any suicide attempts recently, but his ex-wife notes a
prior suicide attempt by wrist slashing in [**2076**]. He states that
he drinks 12 drinks/week, with no episodes of LOC, and has not
had a withdrawal since [**Month (only) 547**] of this year. Per his wife, he is a
heavy drinker, and often isolates himself to drink alone.
Patient denies any hx of liver disease, blood transfusions,
IVDU, or recent travel. He denies any RUQ discomfort. He denies
any prior episodes of confusion, jaundice, or pruritus.
At the OSH, patient was originally alert and oriented. He was
found to have hematuria, coffee grounds emesis, and black tarry
stools, and was admitted. His LFTs were found to be elevated to
AST [**Numeric Identifier **]/ALT 6639/Bili 9.7 (D4.8/I4/9)/INR 9.2, and he was
admitted. His AG was found to be 27. Outside urine tox levels
were negative. Over the course of the day at the OSH, patient
became increasingly obtunded and agitated, requiring intubation.
He was placed on a propofol drip, initiated on folic acid, MVI,
Protonix, Ativan, and Zofran, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.
On admission to [**Hospital1 18**], patient was initially admitted to the
SICU for possible liver transplant in the context of fulminant
hepatic failure. Patient was observed in the SICU, with infusion
of FFP and vit K to reverse his coagulopathy. He was weaned off
his Propofol, and his LFTS trended downward, with improvement in
mental status. He was continued on IV thiamine, MVI, and folic
acid for prophylaxis. He was given several doses of
n-acetylcysteine while acetominophen levels were pending, which
was d/c'd once results were negative. His tox screens have been
negative thus far. Patient was extubated on [**7-13**], and initially
was AOx1, but his mental status gradually improved.
His RUQ U/S showed normal flow in the portal and hepatic
systems, and his head CT showed no hemorrhage or infarct. He was
found to have a low grade temp of 100.1 on [**7-13**], but has
remained afebrile since.
Patient has been visited by SW, who has arranged a meeting
between family members.
[**Name (NI) **] is transferred to the floor for further management of
his recovering liver function.

Asthma - becomes SOB at rest occasionally. No nocturnal sx. Uses
inhaler 2x/day. Has been hospitalized in the past for asthma

Alcoholism - drinks 12 drinks/week by self report. Does not

CT head [**7-13**]:
FINDINGS: There is no hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of
normally midline
structures, hydrocephalus, or acute major vascular territorial
infarction. The
density values of the brain parenchyma are within normal limits.
The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-
white matter differentiation is preserved. The surrounding
osseous and soft
tissue structures are unremarkable. The visualized paranasal
sinuses show
mucosal thickening within the left maxillary sinus. The right
maxillary sinus
is hypoplastic and filled with fluid.

IMPRESSION: No evidence for hemorrhage or acute infarction.

CXR:
[**7-12**]
IMPRESSION:
1. The ET tube is in good position.
2. Patchy atelectasis in the left base with elevation of the
left
hemidiaphragm.

Liver ultrasound [**7-13**]:
IMPRESSION: Normal patency, color flow, and Doppler waveforms of
the hepatic
arteries, hepatic veins, and portal vein, and portal vein
branches. Coarsened
liver echotexture without focal lesions. No ascites.

CXR [**7-16**]:
CHEST, TWO VIEWS, PA AND LATERAL.

History of liver failure with decreased breath sounds and fever.


Heart size is normal. No evidence for CHF. There are small
bilateral pleural
effusions. Probable associated atelectasis at the right lung
base but no
definite pulmonary consolidation.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions and right basilar
ill-defined
opacity, consistent with atelectasis. Correlate clinically and
with follow up
if indicated.

Liver ultrasound [**7-18**]:
INDICATION: Fulminant liver failure with new fever.

Comparison is made to the prior ultrasound dated [**2111-7-13**].

FINDINGS: The liver again demonstrates no focal or textural
abnormalities.
There is no intra- or extra-hepatic ductal dilatation. The main
portal vein
remains patent with the appropriate direction of flow. There is
no
perihepatic ascites. The gallbladder is unremarkable without
evidence of
stones. The right kidney is imaged measuring approximately 12.9
cm with no
evidence of hydronephrosis.

IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the right upper quadrant with
no evidence of
ductal dilatation.

Endoscopy:
Changes suggestive of portal hypertensive gastropathy in the
fundus.
Grade III esophogitis in the gastroesophageal junction, lower
third of the esophagus and middle third of the esophagus


Brief Hospital Course:
44 yo w/hx of SA and alcohol abuse presents with acute hepatic
failure with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and coffee
grounds emesis intubated for AMS likely [**2-4**] hepatic
encephalopathy, originally thought to require liver transplant,
extubated and with clinical improvement with decreasing LFTs.

1. Fulminant hepatic failure. Patient's fulminant hepatic
failure was likely secondary to alcohol and acetominophen
overdose. Patient's family notes multiple empty bottles of
acetaminophen with empty gin bottles, as well as suicide note,
found in apartment by roommate. Throughout his hospital course,
his LFTs and PT/INR were followed daily, with a downward trend.
On discharge, his INR had normalized at 1.0, and AST/ALT were
44/180 from admission values of AST [**Numeric Identifier **]/ALT 6639/Bi
