CHIEF COMPLAINT:  SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND CHEST PAIN.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old
male with a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension,
chronic renal insufficiency, polysubstance abuse, hepatitis
C, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  The patient
presents with the complaint of shortness of breath and chest
pain.  He reports a dry cough for the past five days.  He
denied fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, orthopnea, and
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  He states that his pain
worsened with coughing and deep inspiration and occasionally
radiates to his neck.  The patient reports that for the past
five days, he has been lying in bed, due to the cough.  He
denies recent use of drugs.  He states that he used cocaine
and heroin in the past, but he last used cocaine in
[**Month (only) 116**],  [**2101**].  He denied recent use of heroin.  He states that
he has been complaint with his medications.

Nitropaste, aspirin, and morphine.  He improved with
intravenous fluids, but states that the shortness of breath
persists.

conduction delay.  Left and right atrial enlargement.  Left
ventricular hypertrophy by voltage criteria.
Intraventricular conduction delay, Q-wave flattening in AVL,

and V4.  S-T segment depression 2 mm in V6.  There was no

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission showed a white
count of 5.6, hematocrit 45.9, platelet count 142,000.
Sodium was 130, potassium 3.7, chloride 97, bicarbonate 25,
BUN 30, creatinine 1.6, glucose 88.  First CK was 308, CKMB
3, troponin I less than 0.3.  AST 184, ALT 38, amylase 133,

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially admitted to the
medical team.  It was initially unclear whether the patient's
shortness of breath and chest pain were due to congestive
heart failure or a pulmonary process, such as PE or
pneumonia.  Hospital course will be reviewed by systems.

HEART:

Ischemia.  The patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled to rule
out myocardial infarction.  The patient did rule out for
myocardial infarction.  The patient underwent a cardiac
catheterization on [**2102-9-25**].  The catheterization
disclosed the following:  Normal coronary arteries.  Severe
systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunctions.  Severe
pulmonary hypertension that was partially reversed with IV
dobutamine.  Resting hemodynamics upon entry showed severely
elevated right and left sided filling pressures with a low
cardiac index.  The mean RA pressure was 22 mmHg.  The right
ventricular and diastolic pressure was 25 mmHg.  The PA
pressure was 70/30 mmHg and the mean pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure was 29 mmHg with a cardiac index by [**Last Name (un) **] of
1.8 liters per minute per meter squared.

Rhythm.  The patient was then monitored on telemetry since
the day of admission.  The patient has been noted to have
some episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  He
remains asymptomatic during these episodes.  The patient
continues to take beta blocker.

PUMP:  As stated above, on the day of admission, it was
unclear if the patient's shortness of breath and chest pain
were due to CHF exacerbation or a pulmonary process such as
PE or pneumonia, to investigate whether the shortness of
breath was due to CHF.  On [**9-16**], the patient was
transferred to the coronary care unit for placement of a
pulmonary artery catheter to assess volume status.  Pulmonary
catheter was not placed due to the patient's elevated INR.
Echocardiogram was done on [**9-18**], which disclosed
dilatation of the left atrium and right atrium; left
ventricular wall thickness was normal; left ventricular
cavity was severely dilated; severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis marked dilatation of the right ventricular
cavity; severe 4+ MR; severe 4+ TR seen.  There was mild
pulmonary artery systemic hypertension and significant
pulmonic regurgitation.  There was no pericardial effusion.
The RBG done on [**10-2**] showed the following:  1.
Global akinesis of the left ventricular wall most predominant
at the apex.  2.  Dilated left and right ventricles.  3.
Ejection fraction of 27%.

The patient was initially diuresed with Lasix.  On [**9-19**], the CHF Service was consulted.  The patient was
administered Natrecor and diuretics in an effort to diurese
him aggressively.  The goal was to keep the patient negative
500 to 1 liter.  The patient's ins and outs and daily weights
have been monitored.

On [**9-25**], the patient went back to the coronary care
unit for further aggressive diuresis.  He was placed on a
Lasix drip.  He continued on the Natrecor and Milrinone was
started due to the elevated PVR.  The goal was to diurese the
patient to get him back to his dry weight of 190 pounds.  On
[**9-27**], the Natrecor was discontinued.  The patient has
been restarted on his Digoxin and Toprol XL, and the patient
was transferred back to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] on [**9-27**].

CARDIAC SURGERY:  The patient is currently undergone workup
for possible cardiac transplant.  Initially, the patient was
being evaluat
