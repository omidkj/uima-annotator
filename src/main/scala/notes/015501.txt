Chief Complaint:
Fall at nursing home transfer from outside hospital with large

None

History of Present Illness:
73 yo RHM with DM T2, CAD, h/o seizures of unclear
etiology/semiology, h/o SDH, who presents after an unwitnessed
fall on [**4-11**] at nursing home. After fall, RN's found pt on
floor,
and witnessed a 45 second seizure. There was blood coming from
pt's left ear, otorrhea, and EMS was called. His GCS was 5 on
arrival, he was intubated. At OSH, pt had SBP 160's, BS 188,
sats
94%. Head CT showed L SDH, small right frontal intraparenshymal
bleed, posterior blood over tentorium and in bilateral medial
temporal lobes (by report). He was transferred here for
neurosurgical treatment.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the neurosurgery service and sent to the
neurological surgical ICU. He was loaded with Dilantin, head of
bed was at 30 degrees he was kept in a c-collar given his
mechanism of injury.  He was started on Mannitol to assist with
brain swelling. A CTA was performed which showed a There is
marked elevation of the left middle cerebral artery, including
sylvian points A and B by the huge adjacent hemorrhage within
the left temporal lobe. Slight medial deviation of the proximal
left posterior cerebral artery is presumably a consequence of
the adjacent posterior hippocampal herniation. There is a
stellate-shaped collection of veins along the anteroinferior
aspect of the left temporal hemorrhage. The morphology and lack
of obvious communication with visualized arterial structures
would seem most consistent with the diagnosis of a developmental
venous anomaly. Certainly, it would be most unusual to have a
hemorrhage of this size associated with such a lesion, even in
the presence of a cavernoma.
  He was intubated at outside hospital he had a repeat CT here
showing has shown progression of initial bleed - [**4-12**] large L
temporal lobe bleed,with at least 1.5 cm midline shift to right,
trapping of R lateral ventricle, with blood layering in the
lateral ventricles bilaterally. There is a small R frontal bleed
as before. Pt has remained unresponsive even when off propofol.


 Given his repeat CT and his above angio Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt chances
for a meaningful recovery in the setting of a left dominant
hemisphere insult are marginal surgery would not improve
situation.  He was made DNR.  A neurology consult was obtained
they also concurred and informed the family that there was no
chance for survival from this injury.

His nephew [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 66703**] and the patient wife met with
representatives from neurology, neurosurgery and social work and
decided it would be best to make the patient CMO.  His guardian
ad [**Name2 (NI) 66704**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] who also agreed and requested a affidavit
to push care and comfort order through the court system. The
legal system was unable to have this take place in a timely
fashion. The patient expired on [**2132-4-22**] - hospital day #12.
