Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 31014**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status, swelling and shortness of [**First Name3 (LF) 1440**]


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 90256**] is an 83 year old lady with a past medical history
of systolic/diastolic heart failure (EF 25%), hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, squamous cell lung cancer (Stage T3a-IV), COPD
on 3L home oxygen, anemia (baseline 26) and CKD (baseline 1.63),
who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with altered mental status, peripheral
swelling and shortness of [**Hospital1 1440**].  The patient's daughter has
noticed that she has been going downhill for the past 6 months,
and had been planning to arrange for hospice since [**Month (only) 205**].  She
was started on home oxygen in [**Month (only) 956**] at 2L, which was
increased to 3L in the past month.  Her blood pressure has been
lower since [**Month (only) 958**] in the 100s-110s systolic at her PCP's office
since then (may be lower at home). Over the past two weeks, the
patient has had increasing edema, for which her furosemide has
been augmented by metolazone twice, the first time on [**10-15**] and
the second time on [**11-9**].  It was reported that the patient had
increasing dyspnea and peripheral edema for the 24-48 hours
prior to this admission.  Additionally, the patient had been
screaming, agitated and uncomfortable.  At 3 pm on the day of
admission, the patient's daughter found her unresponsive with a
"swollen tongue."  The patient's daughter's worry escalated as
she could not ascertain what was bothering her mother.  EMS, who
were called 7pm, were initially concerned for an allergic
reaction.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vital signs were 97.2 95
77/45 31 100% 12L on a non-rebreather.  Her tongue was noted to
be normal in appearance, but the patient was having problems
[**Name (NI) 19788**] and her legs were noted to be swollen and tight.  For
systolic blood pressures in the 70s, she was 250 cc NS bolus,
with response to 93/46.  She was then started on dobutamine
drip, with improvement of blood pressure to 132/86.  After
improvement of her blood pressure, she was noted to be [**Name (NI) 19788**]
better.  A right IJ central venous line was placement and x-ray
confirmed placement.  Also received empiric levaquin 750 mg IV
x1 and Percocet x1 for pain.  Labs were notable for proBNP [**Numeric Identifier 90258**]
pg/mL, troponin 0.15, Hct 24.3 (from baseline 26), Cr 2.5 (from
baseline 1.63), albumin 2.9, and UA with moderate leukocytes and
few bacteria.  She was Guaiac negative.  Initial EKG was a poor
study with tachycardia, and subsequent EKG showed NSR @ [**Street Address(2) 90259**] elevations or depressions.  Chest x-ray showed mild
interstitial edema and a right-sided pleural effusion.  She had
minimal UOP, and a Foley was placed.  VS on transfer were: 98.4
95 24 108/56 (on dobutamine 6mcg/kg/min) 95% 3L.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient was agitated and screaming.
She only said a few words and was intermittently able to
localize pain to her legs.  Her initial vital signs were 96.8
113/59 131 27 91% 4L.  Details of the HPI were corroborated with
her daughter.


Past Medical History:
1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: -Diabetes, +Dyslipidemia, +Hypertension

2. CARDIAC HISTORY:
- systolic/diastolic CHF, EF 25%: started metolazone (Zaroxlyn)
with administrations on [**2162-10-15**] and [**2162-11-9**].  Of note, patient
had been admitted in [**2162-7-30**] for dyspnea, thought to be
secondary to acute on chronic heart failure, with bilateral
pleural effusions.  The left was drained with a pigtail catheter
for 1L of transudative fluid.  ProBNP at that time was [**Numeric Identifier 90255**].
3. OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- squamous cell lung cancer: Diagnosed by biopsy of subcarinal
lymph node in [**2162-3-30**].  PET scan [**4-22**] showed diffuse central
lobular emphysema, an 11 x 6 mm spiculated right upper lobe
opacity which was FDG-avid, an SUV max of 2.2, a 7 mm nodule in
the left upper lobe,
more inferiorly in the left upper lobe, 6 mm nodule also
demonstrating FDG avidity, a spiculated opacity in the left
upper lobe, also another nodule in the right middle lobe and in
the
posterior segment of the right upper lobe.  There were also in
the superior segment of the right lower lobe perivascular
nodules.  Left perihilar soft tissue opacity demonstrating FDG
avidity of 2.25.  There was no evidence of any FDG-avid disease
below the diaphragm in the liver or the adrenal gland.  Stage
T3a-IV.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who has been following, offered localized
radiation treatment for any specific symptoms (i.e. bony
metastasis) as palliation but no IV chemotherapy.  Patient has
not pursued palliative treatment.
- COPD/emphysema: severe, with PFTs in [**3-/2162**] FVC 61% predicted,
FEV1 47% predicted, FEV1/FVC 69% predicted. On 3L home oxygen.
Baseline SaO2 in office 88%.
- current tobacco use
- anemia: secondary to B12 deficiency, baseline Hct 26
- chronic kidney disease: baseline Cr 1.63
- peripheral vascular disease
- MGUS
- proteinuria

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 90256**] is an 83 year old lady with a past medical history
of systolic/diastolic heart failure (EF 25%), hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, squamous cell lung cancer (Stage T3a-IV), COPD
on 3L home oxygen, anemia (baseline 26) and CKD (baseline 1.63),
who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with altered mental status, peripheral
swelling and shortness of [**Hospital1 1440**], all likely connected to acute
exacerbation of systolic and diastolic CHF. She was initially
very agitated and disoriented, consistent with acute delerium.
She became anuric, and pressors were started to maintain blood
pressures and to attempt to held urine output.On the morning of
HD 2, she was unresponsive to voice, touch, or pain, and
