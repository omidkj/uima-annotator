History of Present Illness:
74 yo man with h/o CAD s/p MI x3, CHF (EF 40%), HTN, chronic a.
fib (off coumadin since [**9-/2185**] [**2-3**] to GI bleed) who p/w
melanotic stools for the 3rd time since [**Month (only) **].
.
He reports that he noticed dark black stools since the morning 1
day PTA ([**2186-1-10**]).  He denies diarrhea as well as any bright red
blood.  He further denies lightheadedness/dizziness even with
ambulation.  No chest pain/palpitations.  He believes that his
breathing is slightly worse than his most recent baseline on
recent discharge from the hospital on [**2187-1-1**].  He has been
ambulating with PT at home with dyspnea after approx 20 steps
and after [**3-5**] stairs.  He reported the dark stool to his
daughter who is [**Name8 (MD) **] RN who then requested that VNA draw labs
which revealed hct of 18.  He was then brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
low hct in the setting of melanotic stool.
.
In the ED, vitals revealed HR 84, BP 88/42, T 96.9, RR 18 O2 sat
98% on 2L (his home O2 level).  Hct in the ED was 21.7 (down
from 24.9 on recent [**2186-1-1**] discharge).  His pressure
transiently dipped to 70s systolic and was responsive to 1L NS
and returned to mid to high 90s systolic (recent baseline per
daughter has been 100-110s systolic).  NG lavage was negative
for blood.  He has had no further stools.  He has MDS with
assoc. anemia at baseline and hct appears to run 27-29
generally.
.
Per his daughter, EGD was performed at the time of his [**9-7**]
bleed at OSH and revealed a large gastric ulcer.  It is unclear
whether this was biopsied and if H. pylori studies were sent,
but it does not appear that he has been treated for H. pylori.
Additionally he has been taking only once daily PPI.  His
coumadin (which he was on for chronic a. fib) was discontinued
at that time.  He was placed on ASA and plavis following his BMS
which was placed in [**11-7**].
.
ROS: No fevers/chills/URI sx/cough. No
lightheadedness/dizziness, no changes in vision, no focal
numbness/tingling/weakness, no CP/palpitations, no
dysuria/hematuria/trouble starting/stopping stream.  + urinary
frequency [**2-3**] to lasix.  He denies orthopnea/PND, does
occasionally have LE edema, but not since his last admission and
feels that his abdominal girth and weight is down if anything.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
Per daughter's history, patient was found to have gastric ulcer
on OSH EGD so this was considered a likely possibility.
However, his gastric lavage was negative in the ED and repeat
EGD in house showed only mild gastritis without evidence of
active bleeding.  A lower source seemed less likely given
melanotic stools as well as a recent colonoscopy at outside
hospital which showed multiple polyps which were removed at that
time.  Following EGD his PPI was decreased to once daily. His
diet was advanced.  He was restarted on once daily aspirin.
However, as he had already received >4weeks of plavix following
bare metal stent placement, his plavix was not restarted. This
decision was discussed with his Cardiogist who was agreeable
with that plan. He had no further melanotic stools.   He
received a total of 4 units PRBCs over the course of the
admission with appropriate response in his hematocrit and no
further evidence of bleeding. He was hemodynamically stable
throughout his hospital course. His beta blocker and ace
inhibitor were also held on admission in the setting of GI
bleed, restarted prior to discharge.

In the ICU He received 1.5L NS and 4U prbcs during his MICU
course.  He tolerated the volume well without evidence of volume
overload on exam. He maintained O2 sats without any increase in
dyspnea.  As above, his beta blocker
