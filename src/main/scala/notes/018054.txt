History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 112282**] is 85M with history of CKD, HTN, HLD, afib on
coumadin, PUD s/p UGIB [**1-/2141**] who is presenting with chest
discomfort.  The patient reports that the day prior to
presentation he had acute onset of chest discomfort and nausea.
Also reported having intermittent dry heaves.  Reports this his
chest pain last for about two day, with intermittent nausea, but
has since resolved.  He had a scheduled appointment with his
nephrologist yesterday and reported his chest pain; he had an
EKG done that showed, as per report, elevation in V1-V2, and
loss of R waves in V1-3.  The patient was instructed to go to
the ED; however, he refused and instead went home to take care
of his wife.  Of note, the patient is also on coumadin for his
afib; he reports that for one day he was having black diarrhea.
Reports having brown stools mixed with black liquid diarrhea.
Denies any vomiting, but does report having dry heaves as noted
above.  Also reports having decreased PO intake over the last
two days.

He later came to the ED today because he told his doctors that [**Name5 (PTitle) **] would.  The patient is currently chest pain free.

Of note, the patient had UGIB in 2/[**2140**].  He initially presented
with dizziness and was found to be orthostatic in the setting of
having black stools.  His crits remained stable and he never
required a transfusion.  The patient had an EGD, which was
notable for erosive gastritis, erosive duodenitis, hiatal
hernia, and duodenal ulcer.

While in the ED, EKG notable for afib at 62, LAD, new loss of R
waves v1-3, old twi v2-4.  Labs notable for white count of 16.6,
troponin of 4.39, CKMB 45.  Rectal exam notable for brown stool
with some evidence of melena, guiac positive.  The patient was
bolused with pantoprazole and started on pantoprazole drip.
Both ASA and heparin were held given possible GIB.

On arrival to the CCU, the patient reports feeling well.  No
acute complaints.  He denies any chest pain or discomfort.
Denies any trouble breathing or shortness of breath.  Denies any
abdominal pain.  Reports feeling hungry.

Echo [**7-3**]
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate to
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near
akineis of the distal 2/3rds of the septum and anterior walls,
distal inferior and lateral walls. The apex is mildly aneurysmal
and dyskinetic. The remaining (basal) segments contract normally
(LVEF = 25 %). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with focal
hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Apical left vevntricular aneurysm with regional
systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. No left ventricular thrombi.
Regional right ventricular free wall hypokinesis c/w CAD.
Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2141-6-30**],
the findings are similar.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for
which the patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE
inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) **].

[**7-4**] Cardiac perfusion persantine

RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:
   11.0 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m Sestamibi Rest ([**2141-7-4**]);
   29.6 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress ([**2141-7-4**]);
HISTORY: 85 year old male with hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
permanent atrial
fibrillation and chronic kidney disease who had a recent missed
STEMI.

SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:

Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose
of 0.142
mg/kg/min.

IMAGING METHOD:

Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi.
Tracer was
injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting
images.

Following resting images and two minutes following intravenous
dipyridamole,
approximately three times the resting dose of Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi
was administered
intravenously. Stress images were obtained approximately 30
minutes following
tracer injection.

Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT.

This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial
perfusion model.

INTERPRETATION:

Left ventricular cavity size is enlarged with an end diastolic
volume of 143
ml.

Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a focal anteroseptal
wall defect which
shows improvement at rest.

Gated images reveal global hypokinesia.

The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 24%.


IMPRESSION:

1- Focal anteroseptal wall defect which shows improvement at
rest suggesting
persantine induced ischemia.

2- Enlarged left ventricular cavity and global hypokinesia.

3- Calculated LVEF of 24%.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 112282**] is 85M with history of CKD, HTN, HLD, afib on
coumadin, PUD s/p UGIB [**1-/2141**] who is presented with chest pain
and new EKG changes, found to have elevated troponins and guaic
positive stool, with peaked troponins and CK-Mb thought to have
a missed antero-septal MI.

ACUTE ISSUES
#Antero-septal MI:  The patient was noted to have chest pain the
day of presentation and was later found to have ST elevations in
V1-2, with loss of R waves in V1-V3 in the setting also having
an elevated troponin.  Given the patient's recent UGIB and
concern for current possible GIB, also given downtrending CKMB
and trop suggestive of the back end of an MI cath was deferred.
An ECHO was obtained with h/o regional systolic dysfunction.
After admission to the CCU CK-MB was 45, then downtrended to 40.
 Given the patient was chest pain free at this time the infarct
was thought to be completed and there was no angiography
performed.  Patient was treated with medical management in house
with metoprolol (atenolol held).  ACEI was initially held in the
setting of acute on chronic kidney disease (K at 5.3), but after
normalization
