Pertinent Results:
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:
1. Resting hemodynamics prior to milrinone administration
revealed elevated left and right sided filling pressures with
mean PCW
of 26 mmHg and RVEDP of 14 mmHg. There was moderate-severe
pulmonary
arterial hypertension with PASP of 51 mmHg. The cardiac index
was
depressed at 1.78 L/min/m2. The SVR was calculated to be [**2077**]
dyne*sec/cm5.
2. After administration of milrinone (25 mg IV bolus followed by
0.3
mcg/kg/min IV drip), mean noninvasive aortic pressure fell from
80 to 63
mmHg, arterial sat fell from 99 to 95% and SVR fell from [**2077**] to
1195
dyne*sec/cm5. The cardiac index increased from 1.78 to 2.16
L/min/m2 and
mean PCW decreased from 26 to 21 mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Baseline moderate-severe pulmonary arterial hypertension,
right and
left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and severe left
ventricular
systolic function.
2. Succesful milrinone trial.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for evaluation for home milrinone
therapy.  He has a history of severe systolic heart failure,
with multiple admissions where he has required milrinone.  We
performed a trial of milrinone with  PA catheter in the cath lab
to see how his cardiac index, PA pressures, and SVR responded,
and all responses were favorable.  A PICC line was placed, and
the patient was discharged with home milrinone.

called milrinone for your heart failure.  We have determined
that this medication improves your heart function, and would
like for you to get it at home.  We placed a PICC line for long
term intravenous therapy, which will allow you to get the
milrinone at home.  Please do the following:
