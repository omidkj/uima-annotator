Pertinent Results:
CATH:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a codominant system.
The LMCA
was angiographically normal. The LAD had a 30% lesion
proximally,
possibly had an ulcerated area in the mid-vessel. The diagonal
had a 50%
lesion with TIMI 3 flow throughout - possible spontaneous
reperfusion.
The LCX and RCA had mild disease. There was a possible small
fistulae
from teh RCA and LM to PA or mediastinum.
2. Hemodynamics during the case showed elevated filling
pressures (mean
PCWP 18-10) with pulmonary hypertension (PASP 39 mm Hg). There
was
systemic hypotension which required use of dopamine and levophed
for
blood pressure support. An IABP was placed for hemodynamic
support (CI
2.26 on pressors, suggestive of cardiogenic shock). There was no

gradient across the aortic valve on pullback.
3. Left ventriculogram showed an EF of 30% with anterio,
anterolateral,
apical, and inferoapical akinesis/dyskinesis, which corresponds
to a LAD
distribution.

ECHO:
1. The left atrium is elongated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic
dysfunction. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed
(LVEF 20%). Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
akinesis of the
lower [**2-9**]'s of the left ventricle with relative preservation of
the base. A
resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient was varialby
present which may
be related to the inflation of the intra-aortic balloon pump.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal while the apex is
akinetic.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is
no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation
is seen.
6. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. 7.There is an anterior space which
most likely
represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial
effusion cannot
be excluded.

Chest CT:
1. No mediastinal mass.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions with scattered septal lines and
areas of ground glass opacity most consistent with mild
pulmonary edema. In the appropriate setting, an infection should
also be considered.
3. 1 year follow up recommedned for small lung nodules in the
absence of underlying malignancy.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD: Pt presented with STEMI s/p cath and became hypotensive
requiring intra-aortic balloon pump and Levophed, dopamine, and
dobutamine.  The cath showed 30% proximal LAD, possibly had an
ulcerated area in the mid-vessel, the diagonal had a 50% lesion
with TIMI 3 flow throughout (possible spontaneous reperfusion),
the LCX and RCA had mild disease. There was a possible small
fistulae from teh RCA and LM to PA or mediastinum.  Left
ventriculogram showed an EF of 30% with anterio, anterolateral,
apical, and inferoapical akinesis/dyskinesis, which corresponds
to a LAD distribution.  Pt was slowly weaned off of pressors,
and intra-aortic pump was successfully removed, and was started
on carvedilol and captopril.  She was continued on ASA, Lipitor,
and Plavix.  Atenol and lisinopril were started.

2. Pump: The patient had large anterior wall motion
abnormalities on echo in the cath lab.  Formal echo done later
showed severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed
(LVEF 20%). Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
akinesis of the
lower [**2-9**]'s of the left ventricle with relative preservation of
the base.
Unclear whether this is from this MI or from a previous one.  Pt
had bilateral pleural effusion with mild CHF on the chest CT.
Pt required 5L NC, and otherwise would desaturate into 80's.
Standing po lasix 20 mg qd was started.  Anticoagulation with
Coumadin and Heparin were started since she is at risk for
cardioembolic event after acute MI.  Ideally, she should be on
Coumadin for several months.  However, she has a history of fall
in the past, and PT evaluation noted high risk of fall, we
decided to only anticoagulate while she is in-patient in the
hospital and while she is at the acute rehab.  Since pt is going
to [**Hospital1 **] Transitional Care where her PCP will be following, we
spoke with her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 59754**] Mian about this and said that she
will decide whether the patient is safe to continue Coumadin
once she is discharged from the rehab.  Pt noted to have 6 beat
NSVT overnight.  Given her low EF, she may benefit from ICD.
However, given her age and her DNR/DNI status, planning of ICD
was thought inappropriate at this time.  Further discussion with
the family member/HCP should be made before deciding for ICD.

3. Chest:  Possible mediastinal mass was seen during cath.
There was also a question of possible fistula from the RCA and
LM to PA or mediastinum.  Chest CT was obtained which showed no
mediastinal mass but did show a 4 mm nodule in the right middle
lobe. There was a suggestion of possible smaller adjacent nodule
in the upper lobe.  These small nodules should be followed up
with CT in 1 year.

4. Thrombocytopenia: Pt's platelets started to drop since
admission.  HIT antibody was sent which was negative.  Once the
intra-aortic balloon pump was removed, her platelet count
recovered suggesting it was secondary to the pump.

5. Anemia: Pt got 1 unit of PRBC with appropriate rise in Hct.
She had a guiac positive stool but her Hct remained stable.

6. Hypothyroid: She was continued on synthroid.

7. Mental status: Pt was initially confused and delirious since
the cath requiring prn antipsychotics and benzodiazepine.  She
had a positive UA, so her delirium was attributed to UTI and
sun-downing.  She was getting seroquel 25 mg po qhs for several
days with good effect.  After treating UTI with levofloxacin,
her metnal status improved.  She will complete a 14 day course
of UTI.

8. Code: DNR/DNI after long discussion wi
