Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
CHF/Edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2199-7-5**] - Aortic valve replacement with 25-mm,
[**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] bovine pericardial valve.


History of Present Illness:
75 year old man who presented to the mergency department with
ankle swelling. He was diagnosed with CHF and transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] for diuresis and a cardiac catheterization. He was found

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. He formerly smoked 1 ppd X 50 years, but quit smoking [**6-11**]
years ago. He does have a history of alcohol abuse, and

sales manager for GE, and currently works part time for [**Company 42451**] during tax season.


Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death. His father had an MI in his 70s and HTN. Father
and uncles with gastric cancer.

[**2199-7-5**] ECHO
PRE CPB No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the
left atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There
is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40
%). The right ventricle displays borderline normal free wall
function. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
= 0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**2-6**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a
prolapsed segment of the posterior leaflet which is more
calcified and displays somewhat limited mobility. The mitral
valve leaflets are not well seen. Based on vena contracta width,
moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is likely though the jet
color area is more consistent with mild to moderate mitral
regurgitation. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results
in the operating room at the time of the study.

POST CPB The patient is being atrially based and is receiving
epinephrine by infusion. Normal right ventricular systolic
function. Improved left ventricular systolic function with an
ejection fraction of about 50%. There is a well seated
bioprosthesis in the aortic position. The leaflets are only
poorly seen. There is trace aortic regurgitation that appears
valvular thought the exact source is difficult to determine. The
effective orifice area is about 2 cm2. The peak gradient through
the aortic valve is 27 mm Hg with a mean gradient of 14 mm Hg at
a cardiac output of 5 l/m. The mitral regurgitation may be
slightly improved. Mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. The thoracic aorta appears intact.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2199-7-5**] for surgical
management of his aortic valve disease. He was taken directly to
the operating room where he underwent an aortic valve
replacement using a 25mm CE Bovine Pericardial Valve. Please see
operative note for details. Postoperatively he was taken to the
intensive care unit for monitoring. The Electrophysiology
service was consulted to interogate his Pacemaker and ICD which
was found to functioning within normal limits. On postoperative
day one, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact and was
extubated. Aspirin, amiodarone and a statin were resumed. He
required pulmonary toiletting over the next two days for
wheezing and pulmonary edema. On postoperative day three, he was
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. He was
gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. Diuresis had to
be held at times due to an elevated creatinine. The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. He was ready for discharge
to rehab on POD #5.
