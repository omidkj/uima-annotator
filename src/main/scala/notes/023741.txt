Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
HD line

History of Present Illness:
67 M h/o CHF, CABG, DM, CVA, kidney transplant at [**Hospital1 18**] p/w
progressive SOB x 2 months, acutely worse x4-5 days. SOB occurs
at rest, worse with exertion. Endorses chronic cough, no fevers,
chills. Denies CP. Seen at BIDN where he was found to have
troponin elevation to 0.5 which was felt to be demand. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further cardiac & nephrology
evaluation.
Felt to have CHF exacerbation at BIDN, given 80 mg lasix & ASA
162 mg. CXR at BIDN showed pulmonary edema, no consolidative
process.
Renal saw patient in ED, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will follow as consulting
attending. In terms of his renal disease, the patient had a
biopsy several months ago for worsening creatinine which was
negative for rejection.

In the ED, the patient initially wanted to leave AMA but his
wife would not come pick him up. They are frustrated that he was
not directly admitted. Of note, the patient's wife was just
recently diagnosed with breast cancer and is having staging
done.
Cardiology was consulted and they believed likely NSTEMI, b/c
trop out of proportion to [**Last Name (un) **]. Started IV heparin in ED. Pt
refused rectal exam, explained risks. Atorvastatin 80 mg
received in ED. Patient received 164 mg ASA at [**Hospital1 **]. NPO
after MN for possible cath. Vitals at time of admission 99.1 92
132/56 25 96%

On my interview, the patient reports that he is feeling better
and that his breathing is improved but he cannot make it though
a sentence without being short of breath or snorting to open up
his airways. He minimizes his symptoms but says that his wife
reports he's been making much more noise breathing, especially
at night. He says this morning was the worst day in terms of his
over breathing. He also has painful legs, but says they have
been that way since a stroke several years ago. He denies any
chest pain. He again denies any dyspnea when lying down, though
he does have dyspnea with exertion. He denies palpitations.

Brief Hospital Course:
67-year-old man with a complicated medical history that includes
renal transplant and CABG who presented with worsening dyspnea
and likely has an NSTEMI.
.
## The patient was initially admitted to the cardiology floor
service due to history of CAD (s/p CABGX4 in [**2197**]) and based on
patient's elevated troponins and EKG changes, he likely had
NSTEMI. Troponins 0.70 here up from reported 0.59 at outside
hospital, CKMB downtrended. He was medically managed with ASA,
Statin, Plavix, Beta blocker. ACEI/[**Last Name (un) **] was held given worsening
renal function. An echo was done that showed worsening systolic
function EF 25-30%. Pt was in sinus rhythm on the floor. The
patient's systolic pressures were 90s/60s on the floor and given
his worsening renal function (Cr up to 4.6 on the floor),
decision was made to transfer patient to CCU for pressors with
Dobutamine to increase inotropy and renal perfusion. In the CCU
the patient's MAP continued to worsen with Dobutamine so pt was
switched to Norepinephrine to maintain MAP > 60. The patient's
renal function did not improve in the CCU and the patient was
scheduled for dialysis. Unfortunately overnight the patient
expired, please see note below about the details of that event.
..
## CCU DEATH NOTE - On [**2203-8-1**] at 2:30 AM CCU intern was notified
by the nurse about patient??????s nausea. I saw the patient at the
bedside. He complained of some nausea that resolved after one
dose of Zofran. Furthermore, he denied any pain, including lack
of chest pain, no shortness of breath and no diaphoresis. The
patient was oriented x 3, patient??????s mental status was at his
baseline and he was interacting appropriately. At that time his
heart exam was unchanged from earlier in the day, and his lungs
sounded clear, warm and well perfused and non toxic appearing. I
spoke with the patient for about 15 minutes and confirmed that
he was comfortable at that time.  At 3:30am I was again notified
by the nurse about the patient??????s labored breathing. I evaluated
the patient. He now looked significantly worse than at 2:30 am.
His breathing was labored with respiration rate in the 30s. He
was diaphoretic and visibly uncomfortable. The patient denied
chest pain but did confirm difficulty breathing.  I notified my
senior resident and the cardiology fellow at this time. An EKG
was done and the patient received one nebulizer treatment,
followed by check of Chem 7, VBG, lactate. The patient??????s
respiratory rate continued to increase, blood pressures were
variable with some 160s/100s and others 90s/60s by cuff. A non
rebreather was started, and Anesthesia was stat notified. EKG
returned that showed a new left bundle branch block that was not
on his prior EKGs. The patient was intubated at this point as he
was in significant respiratory distress. The patient??????s telemetry
strip showed new onset Ventricular ectopy followed by Vfib
arrest. Chest compressions and a full code were initiated at
this time.  The patient??????s wife was made aware of the life
threatening status and that he was pulseless with active CPR.
The code was called at 4:25 and patient was pronounced dead at
4:56 am after multiple shocks, and multiple rounds of
anti-arrhythmics. There was no ROSC during the full code. Please
see the code med list for details of medications received and at
what time. The patient??????s wife was notified of her husband??????s
death and she decided not to come in today, she did want an
autopsy.
