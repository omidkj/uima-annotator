History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14**] is an 84 year old gentleman with a PMH significant
for recent CAD s/p CABG c/b sternal wound infection on
antibiotics and CHB s/p PPM admitted for a lower extremity rash
concerning for vasculitis and acute renal failure. The patient
underwent CABG in [**6-16**], and was re-admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2103-7-18**]
for sternal wound exploration with a drain placed with cultures
speciated as MSSA. At that time, he was discharged on cefazolin
with the plan for a prolonged 8 weeks of antimicrobial therapy.
On [**8-6**], the ID service was contact[**Name (NI) **] as the patient had
developed a rash over his lower extremities concerning for a
drug rash by his physician at rehab. At that time, given that he
has a history of an unknown PCN reaction, he was converted to
vancomycin. Today, he presented to the [**Hospital 18**] [**Hospital **] clinic, and was
found to have a rash concerning for vasculitis and ARF with a
creatinine of 2 and a serum potassium of 5.7.  He was then
referred to the ED for futher management.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS 97.7 60 133/48 20 95%RA.  ECG was
negative for peaked T waves, the patient received 30 mg
kayexalate, had a negative CXR, and was admitted to Medicine for
further management.  On ROS, the patient reports that he has
been feeling increasingly fatigued over the past week with
decreased PO intake, but denies any f/c/s, n/v/d, abd pain, HA,
palpitations.  He is does not know when his rash developed.
.
On the floor, pt Cr 2.0--> 1.7 with gentle fluid repletion.
However, overnight, pt developed respiratory distress thought to
be 2.2 volume overload. He was given nebs and placed on 4L NC
with good improvement in Os sats. Over the next 24 hours, his
resp status continued to worsen requiring 6L NC. ABG
7.25/58/211/27. Given Nebs and 20mg IV lasix without
improvement. He was then transfered to the MICU for BIPAP.

UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Patient is status post sternal
plating and
left-sided pacemaker device with leads terminating in the right
atrium and
right ventricle. Several epicardial leads are unchanged.
Cardiac,
mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. Multiple external
tubing and
catheter devices are seen projecting over the left upper
quadrant and left
lung base. Patchy opacity in left lung base may reflect
atelectasis. A trace left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
The right lung is grossly clear.  There is no pneumonia.
Surgical anchor is partly imaged projecting over the right
humeral head. No acute osseous findings are seen.

IMPRESSION: Patchy opacity in the left lung base, which could
reflect
atelectasis, but infection is not excluded. Probable trace left
pleural
effusion.

[**8-9**] upper ext U/S
Grey scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the left subclavian and
right subclavian,
IJ, axillary, basilic, and cephalic veins were taken. The lumen
of the basilic vein continues to contain echogenic material from
the proximal end. There is abnormal compressibility, flow, and
augmentation of the basilic vein consistent with thrombosis of
the basilic vein. Otherwise, the remainder of the veins
demonstrate normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation.

IMPRESSION:
Basilic vein thrombosis, unchanged in comparison to prior study.


These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 547**] [**Name (STitle) 1418**] of the
patient's primary
clinical team at approximately 11:30 a.m. on [**2103-8-9**].

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


[**8-9**] renal u/s
The right kidney measures approximately 10.2 cm.
The left kidney measures approximately 9.8 cm.

A small simple cyst measuring 1.8 x 1.6 x 1.7 cm is visualized
in the upper pole of the right kidney. Otherwise, there is no
hydronephrosis, stones, or masses. Of note are bilateral pleural
effusions visualized.

IMPRESSION:
Normal renal son[**Name (NI) **]. Evidence of bilateral pleural effusions
was noted.
These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 547**] [**Name (STitle) 1418**] of the
patient's primary clinical team at approximately 11:30 a.m. on
[**2103-8-9**].
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


[**8-9**] chest x-ray
SUPINE AP AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: There are
layering bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the left and
small on the right, unchanged.
There is bibasilar consolidation, significantly worst on the
left and could reflect a combination of atelectasis, effusion,
and/or pneumonia. There is no significant pulmonary edema or
pneumothorax. Sternal plating hardware is unchanged, epicardial
pacing leads are again visualized. There is a left chest wall
pacer with right atrial and ventricular leads in unchanged
location. Left midline catheter and mediastinal drain is
unchanged.

IMPRESSION: No significant change in moderate left and small
right pleural
effusion and large left basilar consolidation.

[**8-10**] chest xray
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Sternal fixators, unchanged course of pacemaker leads.
Unchanged
size of the cardiac silhouette, mild cardiomegaly with mild
pulmonary edema and associated bilateral small pleural
effusions. No evidence of newly appeared parenchymal opacities
suggestive of pneumonia.
