Chest Xray [**8-20**]: There is a left lower lobe consolidation which
appears unchanged and possibly worse due to better visualization
on the lateral radiograph. Otherwise, cardiomediastinal
silhouette, hilar silhouette, pleural surfaces remain unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Persistence of left lower lobe opacity with possible
worsening.

Urine Cultures: NGTD ([**8-22**])

Brief Hospital Course:
81 yom with afib on coumadin and digoxin, gout on prednisone
2.5mg, dx with UTI at OSH 1 day PTA was sent home with bactrim,
presented to OSH  with increased weakness.  BP at home in the
80's, and daughter gave 2 liters of IVF.  He came off prednisone
x 4 days.  At the OSH ED, patient was given 2 L of fluid,
ceftriaxone, SAT 88% on RA, had an episode of bradycardia into
the 30's for about 30 secs.  Transferred from [**Hospital1 **] due to lack
of MICU bed. Sepsis and hypotension stabilized in MICU and
transferred to medicine floor for management of adrenal
insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and klebsiella + UTI. Physical
exam also notable for R chest port and a prolapsed ostomy.
.
.
# Hypotension: Pt presented to ED with hypotension likely
related to urosepsis. Urine cultures were sent and came back
positive for Klebsiella susceptible to Zosyn. There was a
pulmonary process as seen on CXR in the LLL.  EKG appears wnl,
with mild elevation of trop in the setting of renal failure.
Slightly elevated troponins felt to be non cardiogenic.  He
received IVF in MICU with BP responded. His Hct downtrended to
24 (with a baseline of 30), This change in Hct was likely
hemodilutional. There was question if there is a bleeding source
and Hct was monitored for rest of stay with observed
stabilization of Hct to 26-27. No end organ damage seen (lactate
wnl). Hypotension felt secondary to
