Chief Complaint:
somnolence

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
64 y/o male with PMHx of IDDM, COPD, ESRD, PVD, CHF, OSA who was
brought in by EMS to ED after family stated that for the past
few days patient has been intermittent confusion and slurred
speech.  The patient denied significant use of narcotics.
When patient came to the ED patient had head CT which was
negative. He was put on NRB for low O2Sat and patient remained
somnolent. Felt that patient may be somnolent from narcotics so
gave him Narcan 0.4mg IV and felt that he intermittently woke up
but then again became somnolent so was started on Narcan gtt. An
initial VBG in the ED showed CO2 of 30 but when this was
repeated it was 97 and felt patient had hypercapnic respiratory
failure. He was given a dose of levofloxacin and given 40IV
lasix and put on nitro paste. Narcan drip was stopped and
patient sent to the ICU. On arrival to the ICU patient somnolent
and was quickly put on 2L NC with O2Sat of 100%. He was
arousable to painful stimuli and would open his eyes but then
quickly fall asleep. A repeat ABG was obtained on 2L NC which
revealed 7.31/72/95.  A K+ was also drawn with the ABG which
came back as 6.6. Given his dependence on HD and anuria, he was
dialyzed both on [**5-4**] and [**5-5**], removing 3 kg on each session as
he appeared volume overloaded. By [**5-5**], he was breathing
comfortably on his own, and continued to do so on [**5-6**].
He has recent amputations of both toes during hospitalization
[**Date range (1) 108564**]/07 which were noted to be draining purulent material,
for which vancomycin and ceftriaxone were given. Azithromycin
was added for coverage of possible atypical pneumonia.

Pertinent Results:
[**2166-5-4**] CT HEAD: 1. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Scattered low-attenuation foci in bihemispheric
periventricular white matter, overall unchanged from study dated
[**2166-1-23**], likely reflect chronic microvascular infarction.
.
[**2166-5-4**] CXR: 1. Markedly low lung volumes limit examination for
small areas of consolidation or mild pulmonary edema. Given
limitations, no definite evidence of an acute cardiopulmonary
process is identified.
2. Persistent left mid zone atelectasis/scarring and
cardiomegaly.
.
[**2166-5-4**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. No significant change since the
previous tracing of [**2166-4-20**].

Brief Hospital Course:
1) Hypercapnic respitory failure:
The etiology was mostly likely multifactorial with sleep apnea,
fluid overload, medication effect, COPD exacerbation being most
prominent.  There was no evidence of a pneumonia.  In ICU, pt
was put on NIMV.  He was also dialyzed serially for fluid
removal.  He was started on antibiotics (Ctx and azithro) for
possible pneumonia though CXR showed no clear infiltrate.  He
was also given a regimen of bronchodilators.  With these
therapies, his breathing improved and returned to baseline.  He
was taken off O2.  He continued nocturnal Bipap for OSA.  Once
transferred to the floor, his resp status remained stable.  His
neurontin dose was adjusted.  He continued to require low dose
oxycodone for b/l LE pain but was warned against the dangerous
effects of overuse.
.
2) Peripheral [**Year/Month/Day **] Disease:
Initial exam in ICU was concerning for infection at right foot
amputation site.  Pt was started on ctx and vanco.  A
superficial culture was obtained which was consistent with MRSA
and pseudomonas similar to previous strains.  Ctx was changed to
zosyn.  [**Year/Month/Day **] surgery was consulted and did not feel there
was active infection of the area.  The recommended wound care
but no necessity for antibiotics.  Given culture was
superficial, it likely represented colonizing bacteria.
Antibiotics were then stopped.  PT will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
regarding planned BKAs.
.
3) ESRD:
Pt was dialyzed aggressively on admission and then resumed his
normal tiw schedule.
.
4) CARDIOVASCULAR:
There was evidence of fluid overload on initial exam and this
was managed with HD.  Pt appeared euvolemic by discharge.
There was no evidence of ACS.  PT had moderate elevation in
cardiac enzymes c/w CHF in ESRD.  His outpt regimen of [**Last Name (STitle) **],
[**Last Name (STitle) 4532**], statin, lopressor, and ACE-I were continued.
.
4) DM2: placed on sliding scale.
.
5) OSA:
Pt received BiPAP while in house however because he has not had
it at home recently, it could not be set up at this time.  He
was setup for a sleep evaluation after which the machine can be
arranged for him.
