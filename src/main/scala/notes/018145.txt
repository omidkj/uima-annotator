Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Bradycardia, increasing lower extremity swelling and pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
DC cardioversion

History of Present Illness:
73 yo f w/ h/o pulm embolism ([**8-9**]), presumed diastolic CHF
(last echo normal), gout X 3 years, who presented to OSH on
[**2129-2-10**] with gradual increasing lower extremity edema, bilateral
foot pain, and increasing doses of colchicine at home.  At OSH,
she had decreased UOP and HR noted to be 30-40 w/ response w/
atropine 0.5mg to 70s (unclear if symptomatic).  At that time,
the pt also had Hct 24 with guiaic positive stool, transfused 1
unit PRBCs, 1 unit FFP, and noted to be in renal failure with
BUN/Cr 134/6.1.  At this point she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Here, the pt was noted to be afebrile, with abd pain, and
received IVF with bicarb, and underwent abd CT, showing an
abdominal aortic aneurysm, and right kidney hyperdense lesion,
small effusion and atelectasis. Also, she was given vanco, levo,
and flagyl for presumed ?intraabd source in the ED.  Cards was
consulted and felt that patient likely had sick sinus syndrome
given sinus brady w/ junctional escape rhythm on her EKG. She
was admitted to the ICU.  In ICU, remained bradycardic and
asymptomatic, normotensive. On am [**2-12**], immediately tachycardic
to 130s, with EKG showing an irregular tachycardia, afib? w/ ST
depressions in lateral leads and in leads I and aVL. Renal was
consulted as well regarding her ARF, thought [**1-6**] to a
combination of increasing doses of colchicine and indocin in the
setting of her increasing lower extremity pain/edema.  She was
dialyzed [**2-11**] and [**2-12**], started on phosphate binders, epo on
[**2-14**], and on [**2-15**], renal felt that her renal HD catheter could
be pulled (had to be off heparin gtt for this).  On [**2-16**], renal
felt HD no longer needed. Spoke w/ cards consult, originally
felt that patient should not receive nodal [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for rate
control but subsequently started PO Dilt 90mg QID. As of today
(day of transfer, she is hemodynamically stable with an intact
BP and so immediate plan will be to d/c her lopressor/norvasc
and have atropine at bedside, keep [**Hospital1 **] pads in place. She was
evaluated by EP for possible pacer placement for tachy/brady
syndrome, however, EP would like pt to undergo DC cardioversion
tomorrow in holding area prior to pacer plans.  Pt is to be
continued on heparin gtt in anticipation of cardioversion.
.
The pt states she feels well.  She c/o chronic bilateral lower
extremity pain with swelling (several weeks).  No
CP/SOB/palpitations.  No N/V. Tolerating po well.  No abd pain.
Urinating ok.  Not able to walk [**1-6**] "pins and needles" sensation
in lower extremities when bearing weight.  She states the pain
is at the bottoms of the feet bilaterally, like "knives."  No
other complaints.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CXR [**2129-2-10**]: Mild Cardiomegaly. Bibasilar atelectasis. No chf.
.
[**2129-2-11**]: Abd CT: 1. Small right-sided pleural effusion and right
lower lobe atelectasis. 2. Small ascites. 3. Nonspecific
stranding in the anterior and posterior right pararenal spaces.
Correlation with patient's amylase and lipase is recommended.
**4. 3.2 cm Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm. Follow-up recommended. 5.
Right kidney small hyperdense lesion. Evaluation with US
recommended.
.
RENAL US [**2129-2-11**]
RENAL ULTRASOUND: The right kidney measures 8.3 cm. The left
kidney measures 8.4 cm. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis,
nephrolithiasis, or renal masses. There is bilateral cortical
thinning. The urinary bladder is not visualized and the patient
has a Foley catheter in place.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or
renal mass.
.
TTE:  [**2129-2-11**]:  EF >55%
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
difficult to assess but is probably normal (LVEF>55%).
3. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
4. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
6. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
ECG:
[**2-10**] 51, sinus brady w/ junctional escape in the 40s. No ST-T
wave changes.
.
[**2-12**] 136, nl axis, afib, std in V4-V6, I/L

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT: 73 yo f w/ diastolic CHF, gout, PE p/w bradycardia
thought to be due to sick sinus syndrome, acute renal failure,
gout flare, GI bleed.
.
1.  CV:
Pump: The patient has known diastolic dysfxn with last TTE on
[**2129-2-11**] demonstrating EF>55%.  Although there was no comment on
E/A ratio, clinically this would indicate impaired relaxation as
pt was clinically in flash pulmonary edema in the setting of
hypertension.  The clinical finding of flash pulmonary edema was
confirmed with a CXR.  The pt received one episode of HD to
remove fluid but has since been able to diurese successfully.
She was started on afterload reducing agents including
hydralazine and nitrates.  As her creatinine was elevated, she
was not able to be started on ACEI or [**Last Name (un) **] at the time of this
admission.  Her Hydralazine was increased to 75mg Q6hours, and
isorsorbide dinitrate was increased to 60mg TID.  These
medications were chosen over her previous outpt regimen which
consisted of amlodipine (as this can cause side effect of fluid
retention and LE edema) and metoprolol (discontinued due to
episodes of bradycardia and concern for sick sinus syndrome).
She was aggressively diuresed on lasix 80mg IV BID and achieved
neg 1L per day.  She was subsequently converted to a PO regimen
which included lasix 80mg in AM and lasix 40mg in PM.  The pt
was followed by the renal service for her renal failure and
fluid overload who oversaw our management.
   At acute rehab, the pt should be continued on diuresis with
PO regimens consisting of lasix 80mg PO QAM and 40mg PO QPM.
She should have daily weights and ins and outs monitored to
document appropriate diuresis (goal of neg 500cc/day).  In
addition, her renal function should be followed closely
(electrolytes three times a week) to observe for worsening renal
failure.  She should follow up with the [**Hospital 18**] [**Hospital 10701**] clinic
in one to two weeks time to assess her renal function.
.
Rhythm: The pt was initially admitted with bradycardia.  This
may have been secondary to a sick sinus syndrome vs. beta
blocker overdose in setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
