History of Present Illness:
62 yo man with h/o homograft repair of coarcted aorta at age 13
who underwent ascending-to-descending aorta bypass with Gelweave
graft here [**1-29**] for progressive stenosis of his coarctation.
Post-op course complicated by HIT. He was ultimately d/c'd on
[**2-17**].
.
He returned to the ED [**2-20**] with three days of fever, chills,
cough, and dyspnea. Looked toxic in the ED, got vanc and
meropenem (despite PCN allergy). Coughing on the floor [**2-20**], he
dehisced his sternum and likely ruptured his RV at the same
time. [**2-20**] went to OR for exploration, debridement, and repair
of RV rupture with pericardium. Returned to the OR hours later
for relief of cardiac and chest wall edema that were compressing
his RV; the chest was left open. Swab from this procedure later
grew SCN. He was in the unit with a tegaderm over his chest for
4 days on broad spectrum abx. He returned to the OR for omental
flap (to the area that his sternum previously occupied) [**2-24**] and
cultures of an "aortic clot" extracted later grew SCN x2 and
gamma strep. We narrowed his antibiotics to vancomycin alone
with the thought that these were true pathogens (got there
during his 4 days of tegaderm to the chest). We have assumed
that this has infected his graft.
.
He did well for several days (weaned off pressors, stayed
afebrile and had norwal WBC count). Unfortunately, he spiked a
temp on [**3-2**]; by [**3-3**] blood cultures from fem a-line grew VRE.
He was started on linezolid and vancomycin was d/c'd. He
returned to the OR on [**3-6**] and had a STSG placed over the
omental flap in his chest. Unfortunately, omentum sample taken
intra-op grew VRE. We decided to treat for 4 weeks with
linezolid ([**Date range (1) 31213**]) to clear the tissue under the graft and to
help the graft take.
.
He was slow to wean from the vent after this and was ultimately
trach'd [**3-21**]. He continued to have intermittent low grade fevers
of unclear source (likely PICC line, but primary team refused to
remove it). He was d/c'd to rehab on [**3-26**], but only made it [**Street Address(1) 31214**] before having resp. distress. He was readmitted
the same day febrile to 102. The team got blood cultures, but
discharged him again [**3-27**] without identifying the etiology of
his fever. The following day, [**3-28**], blood cultures drawn through
PICC grew yeast. The CT surgery team and rehab people decided
not to readmit him. ID consultants called the rehab and got the
PICC line pulled, more cultures drawn and fluc 400 iv Q24h
started (they did not want to start caspo). The yeast was later
speciated as [**Female First Name (un) 564**] parapsilosis. He did OK at rehab and was
actually switched from linezolid to suppressive doxycycline (for
the SCN/gamma strep graft infection) on [**4-2**].
.
On [**4-3**] he developed fever and rigors. The CT surgery team did
not want to readmit him, so he was admitted to MICU. Overnight
he spiked to 102.6. He had copious secretions; cefepime was
added empirically for VAP. Sputum grew ESBL Klebs susceptible
only to meropenem; cefepime was changed to [**Last Name (un) 2830**] [**4-5**].
.
Fungemia w/u included ophtho exam and TTE, both negative.
.
At rehab, he has been stable.  However, his blood cultures from
[**3-26**] grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 31215**] (from R PICC line).  The PICC was
removed and another placed on the left.  He has been treated
with fluconazole (400 IV per ID recs) since [**3-28**].  He was
transferred here for further evaluation and management.  His
other issues at rehab have been mainly renal, as he has been
hypernatremic and hypokalemic which was felt by their renal
consult to be due to overdiuresis, and improved with backing off
on diuretics.

TTE:
Conclusions:
1.The left atrium is dilated. A left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial septum is seen through a small secundum atrial
septal defect at rest.
2. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed, with mild global hypokinesis.
3.The right ventricular cavity is small. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal.
4.There are simple atheroma in the aortic root and in the
descending aorta. The distal ascending aorta and aortic arch are
incompletely visualized, probably owing to the presence of a
surgical aortic bypass conduit.
5.The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly
thickened, with focal calcification at the base of the more
posterior cusp. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildl
