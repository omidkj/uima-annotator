Penicillins / Demerol / aspirin / NSAIDS

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 594**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation with endotracheal tube

History of Present Illness:
87yo F with a history of dementia, afib, COPD (on home O2)
presented from nursing home with dyspnea and respiratory
distress.
.
The patient was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED from NH and found to
have oxygen saturations in the 80s. She was initially given
non-invasive ventilation, which she did not tolerate well, so
she was intubated and sedated. Shortly thereafter, she was
bradycardic to the 40s and then went into PEA arrest. CPR was
initiated and the patient received epinephrine x 2, bicarbonate
and calcium chloride. She underwent 15 minutes of CPR and
regained a pulse. Chest x-ray was concerning for a possible
pneumothorax on the left so she underwent needle decompression
with subsequent bilateral chest tube placement. A significant
amount of fluid came out (right- blood, left, transudate). A
femoral line was placed and the patient was started on triple
pressors (dopamine, levophed and neosynephrine). Post-arrest
team evaluated the patient and recommended therapeutic
hypothermia if blood pressures were stable, which was not the
case in the ED. CTA demonstrated large left-sided PE. She was
sent to the MICU for further management.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was intubated and
unresponsive. Her daughter, [**Name (NI) 8513**] (HCP) was called and stated
the patient would not want heroic measures performed and to
transition to comfort care only. We discussed that this meant
extubating the patient and removing all pressors as well as
starting a morphine drip for pain control, which the health care
proxy agrees with. She states the patient has been unhappy for
the past few years and would not want live like this. Her
nursing home states that the patient expressed that she would
like to be allowed to die peacefully but there was no official
DNR/DNI status outlined by her [**Hospital3 2558**] physician.

PEA arrest- likely secondary to PE. Patient s/p CPR for 15
minutes where she received epinephrine x 2, bicarbonate and
calcium chloride in the ED. She was on placed on 3 pressors
(dopamine, levophed and neosynephrine) and sent to the MICU. HCP
was [**Name (NI) 653**] and was explicit in that the patient would not
want these "heroic" measures performed and wants to focus on
comfort care only. She is aware that this means that the patient
would be extubated and pressors would be discontinued. Patient
would be started on morphine for comfort purposes. HCP

a morphine gtt for comfort. Pt expired shortly after.
