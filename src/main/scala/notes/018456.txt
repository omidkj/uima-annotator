History of Present Illness:
87 year old male presented to PCP for
cough, and found to have rate in 150s. He was sent to NEBH
ambulatory hospital where EKG was suspicious for aflutter and
troponin was 3.6. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Here, he received
lopressor 2.5 mg IV and Cardizem 10 mg IV without improvement.
He
then received 60 mg PO diltiazem, and converted to aflutter with
ventricular rate of 87. He was admitted and sent for cardiac
catheterization and found to have critical aortic stenosis. He
is
now being referred to cardiac surgery for an aortic valve
replacement.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiovascular Report Cardiac Cath Study Date of [**2178-4-14**]

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
3. Biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
4. Critical aortic stenosis.
5. Reduced ejection fraction with anterior wall hypokinesis

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2178-4-16**] 8:29 AM
IMPRESSION:
1.  Non-calcified, dilated, fusiform ascending aorta.
2.  Diffuse bibasilar ground-glass peribronchial opacity could
represent a
nonspecific interstial pneumonitis or mild CHF.
3.  Probable tracheobronchmalacia involving the trachea and
bilateral mainstem
bronchi.
4.  Dilated right main pulmonary artery.  Consider pulmonary
hypertension.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

[**2178-4-20**] Intra-op TEE:
Conclusions
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is significant
aortic valve stenosis with fixed left and non-crornary cusps.
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.

POSTBYPASS
Biventricular systolic function remains preserved. There is a
well seated, well functioning bioprosthesis in the aortic
position. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The MR remains mild.

[**5-6**] PA&Lat:
IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**5-2**]:

Previous mild pulmonary edema has cleared, and moderate left
lower lobe
atelectasis and small left pleural effusion have decreased.
There is,
however, a new cluster of nodular opacities in the right mid
lung laterally
(projected over the right first and second ribs), which could be
residual or
organized infection.  Findings are consistent with patient's
clinical picture,
CT scanning would be helpful in comparison to the scan on [**4-24**].  It is
useful to note that there were no lung nodules at that time
concerning for
malignancy.

DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3891**]


Brief Hospital Course:
87 y/o healthy male with HTN and BPH who initially presented to
PCP for cough, found to have rate in 150s, with EKG suspicious
for atrial flutter, and elevated cardiac enzymes suggestive of
NSTEMI. The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2178-4-20**]
where the patient underwent Aortic Valve Replacement with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.   Initially out
of OR he was hypoxic and extubation was delayed until the
following morning. POD 1 the patient eventually extubated and
was neurologically intact.  He developed rapid atrial
fibrillation. Amiodarone was initiated and the patient converted
to SR.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was diuresed
toward the preoperative weight.   He developed respiratory
distress and was re-intubated on POD 2.  Bronchoscopy was
performed and large mucus plug removed from RLL.  Vancomycin and
Cefepime were started empirically for pneumonia.  Dob Hoff was
placed for tube feeds. He remained intubated 2nd to hypoxia
continued agitation and confusion. He eventually extubated on
[**4-26**] but was reintubed 6 hours later due to respiratory distress
and agitation. He was stated on coumadin for a-fib but he became
supratherapeuitic  and due to the fact that he remained in SR
coumdain was dc'd.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complications. He eventually extubated
again on [**4-29**] and required aggressive pulmonary toileting. He
completed a course of antibiotics despite negative cultures, his
WBC were elevated during his post-op course but have since
returned to [**Location 39511**]. His current CXR still shows RML density but
clinically he has improved. He will need to be followed closely
while at rehab. Due to his confusion he was started on Seroquel
but this was discontinued due to over sedation, he responded
well to low dose haldol but this was discontinued prior to
discharge. He remains pleasently confused but cooperative.   He
was evaluated by speech and swallow and diet was advanced as
indicated.   The patient continued to make slow progress and was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  While
on the floor continued to progress. He has been incontinuent at
times and needs assistance with walking and care. The patient
was evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance
with strength and mobility. He was deemed safe for discharge on
POD#17 to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
