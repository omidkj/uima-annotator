Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
thoracic aortic penetrating

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Repair of descending thoracic aortic penetrating ulcer with a
[**Doctor Last Name 4726**] TAG endograft, reference number [**Serial Number 65878**], lot number [**Serial Number 76913**]


History of Present Illness:
This is a woman who presented with anemia and CT scan showing
left chest full of blood and a bedside MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] indicative of
ulceration of the aorta with intramural hematoma just past the
subclavian takeoff. The patient was

CHEST (PA & LAT)

The cardiomediastinal contour is stable with no change in
appearance of the endo-aortic graft. The left retrocardiac
atelectasis is unchanged. Small amount of subcutaneous air in
the right chest wall is stable. There is no change in small
right pleural effusion. There is no pneumothorax. There is no
evidence of failure

[**2156-1-9**] 11:04 AM

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-; CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS

CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Since the examination
of [**2156-1-6**], there has been placement of an endovascular
aortic stent graft with its proximal end at the level of the
distal aspect of the left subclavian artery, terminating in the
distal descending aorta. There is no evidence of contrast
extravasation beyond the margins of the graft. The mediastinal
hematoma has decreased slightly in size since [**1-6**]. The
left-sided hemothorax has been largely evacuated, and a
left-sided chest tube is in place entering via a left
intercostal approach, tracking in the major fissure and
terminating adjacent to the mediastinum. A small right-sided
hydropneumothorax with apical/anterior and posteromedial
component is present. A right-sided pleural effusion and
adjacent compressive atelectasis have decreased. The heart and
pericardium, and central airways appear unremarkable.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The
aorta is normal in caliber and contour with mural calcification
consistent with atheromatous disease. The branch vessels,
including the celiac, superior mesenteric, renal, and inferior
mesenteric arteries, are patent. Note is made of an accessory
renal artery on the right. There is an accessory left hepatic
artery arising from the left gastric artery.

Two hypodense lesions in the liver (segment IVB, 3:109 and
segment I,
3:97) are unchanged and likely represent cysts. Contrast in the
gallbladder is consistent with vicarious excretion. In the
pancreatic head, a 7-mm oval hyperenhancing nodule appears
unchanged from the contrast-enhanced examination performed at
the outside hospital on [**1-6**]. The spleen and splenule,
right adrenal gland, appear unremarkable. Multiple parapelvic
cysts are present on the left. A 3.5 x 6.5 cm fat and soft
tissue density lesion which is continuous with the medial limb
of the left adrenal gland, is consistent with a myelolipoma. A
second smaller fat density lesion in the upper portion of the
left adrenal gland (3:87), is consistent with a smaller adrenal
myelolipoma. The large and small bowel loops are normal in
caliber. There is diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon with
contrast retained in multiple diverticulae.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The bladder, distal
ureters, prostate and seminal vesicles, rectum appear
unremarkable. There is sigmoid colonic diverticulosis without
evidence of inflammatory change. There are no pathologically
enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes. Bilateral
fat-containing inguinal hernias are present.

BONE WINDOWS: No lesions worrisome for osseous metastatic
disease are identified. There is subcutaneous emphysema within
the tissues of the left chest wall near the site of insertion of
the chest tube.

IMPRESSION:
1. Status post placement of descending aortic endovascular stent
graft without evidence of leak.
2. Left-sided hydropneumothorax with marked decrease in
hemothorax since [**1-6**], and with interval placement of a
chest tube.
3. Decreased simple right pleural effusion and atelectasis.
4. 7 mm enhancing nodule in the pancreatic head most likely
represents a hyperenhancing pancreatic mass such as a
neuroendocrine tumor.
5. Two fat and soft tissue density containing left adrenal
lesions consistent with myelolipoma.
6. Unchanged hypodense hepatic lesions consistent with cysts.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a woman who presented with anemia and CT scan showing
left chest full of blood and a bedside MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] indicative of
ulceration of the aorta with intramural
hematoma just past the subclavian takeoff. The patient was
transferred here and CT was repeated without an interval change
in the left chest hematoma or the appearance of the aorta. She
is taken emergently for stent graft repair.

Pt did recieve transfusion x 3 / HCT stable

CT placed - left chest hematoma

Pt tolerated the procedure well. No complications. She was
transfered to the CVICU in stable condition. Weaned from
pressure suppore / Extubated.

She [**Last Name (un) 19692**] then transfered to the Fllor in stable condition.

Pt worked with patient

CTA performe post - placement of descending aortic endovascular
stent graft without evidence of leak.

CT DC'd

CXR showed - post removal of a right central line, a left chest
drainage tube with no pneumothorax. Small post-operative
pneumomediastinum seen along the left heart border. Prominent
aorta; ascending aorta and arch secondary to previous surgery
with graft placement.

Slight increase in the left pleural effusion.
