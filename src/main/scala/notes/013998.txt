HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old
male who was admitted to the CMI Service.  The patient
underwent a cardiac catheterization and was referred from
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to the cardiac laboratory.  He is a 77-year-old
man with a history of rheumatic heart disease and congestive
heart failure.  The [**10-19**] echocardiogram showed normal LV
function with mitral stenosis and 3+ mitral regurgitation
with aortic sclerosis without stenosis.  He was not
indicative for any heart failure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Rheumatic heart disease.
2.  Hard of hearing.
3.  History of congestive heart failure.

Risks factors for coronary artery disease include the
following:  Hypercholesterolemia and he is a former smoker
who quit 20 years ago.

No diabetes or hypertension was found on history.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.
2.  Umbilical hernia repair.

He denied any cerebrovascular accidents, strokes, transient
ischemic attacks.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.  He is
not allergic to shellfish or oral contrast.

The patient was found to have 50% left main occlusion, 50%
RCA occlusion, 50% LAD occlusion, 3+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] denied chest
pain or shortness of breath.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs preoperatively revealed the CBC of
6.4, 40, and 258 with chemistry of 144, 4.6, 105, 25, 16, and
29, with a glucose of 74.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on [**2159-1-10**] showed no
carotid bruits.  HEART:  Heart was regular in rhythm.  There
was a slight systolic murmur consistent with the known MR.
LUNGS:  Lungs were clear.  He had a umbilical scar consistent
with his old surgery.  He had severe varicose disease of his
lower extremities.  Peripheral pulses were intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2159-1-12**], the patient was taken to the
operating room for coronary artery bypass graft times three
with LIMA to LAD, SVG, RCA.  Surgeon was Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**],
[**Name5 (PTitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **].

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on
postoperative day #1, whereupon he was doing well.
Electrolytes were replaced postoperatively.  He was having a
relatively uneventful hospital course significant only for a
hematocrit of 18.8 on [**1-13**].

On [**2159-1-14**] the patient continued to do well.  The hematocrit
increased to 26.2.  We continued to manage the issues.  The
pain was well controlled.  The patient received some
....................for low urine output, however, that was
inconsequential.  The patient was alert and oriented.  The
patient was transferred to the floor.  The patient then had
an uneventful hospital course.  The chest tubes were then
discontinued.  The Foley was discontinued on [**2159-1-15**].
The patient's diet was advanced as the hematocrit was stable
at 26.2.  There was no JVD.  The lungs were relatively clear
and he was in a regular rhythm.  He still had systolic
murmur, which was consistent with his findings.

On [**2159-1-16**], the patient was discharged to rehabilitation as
a level 2 to 3.

Physical examination upon discharge shows that he is
noninfected.  The sternal wound has no discharge, no
erythema, no click.  Heart is regular rhythm.  Lungs are
relatively clear.  The leg incision for the harvest site is
nonerythematous.  There was no discharge.

The final discharge labs are the following:  6.8, 25.5, and
223 with a Chem 7 of 138, 4.0, 103, 26, 13, 0.5, 107.  Minor
electrolytes have all been repleted, of course.  Wires were
finally discontinued prior to discharge on [**2159-1-16**] and the
patient was discharged to rehabilitation on the following
medications:

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 15 mg PO b.i.d. to be held for a systolic blood
pressure less than 110, heart rate of less than 60.
2.  Lasix 20 mg PO q.12h.held for creatinine greater than
1.5.  He should receive that for ten days.  While on the
Lasix he will get potassium chloride 20 mEq q 12h.
3.  Colace 100 mg PO b.i.d.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg PO q.d.
5.  Zestril 2.5 mg PO q.d., which was started during his
hospital stay for a somewhat high blood pressures.  He takes
this at home as baseline.
6.  Ranitidine 150 mg PO t.i.d.
7.  Percocet 1 to 2 tablets PO q.4 to 6h.p.r.n. pain.

MEDICATIONS:  (at home) All restarted prior to discharge.

FOLLOW-UP CARE:  The patient is to followup in four weeks.
