HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year old
male with past medical history of hypertension, diabetes
mellitus and hypercholesterolemia, who was admitted on
[**2130-11-22**], to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with the chief
complaint of fever and cough.  He was found on admission to
be hypoxic and with bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray,
diagnosed as heart failure versus pneumonia.  He was treated
with Levofloxacin initially in the unit and improved rapidly,
was called out to the floor the next day, however,
transferred back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit the
following day for progressive hypoxia.  At that point, his
antibiotics were Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin and he was
diuresed gently for question of congestive heart failure.  An
echocardiogram on [**2130-11-27**], showed an ejection fraction of 30
to 35% and multiple wall motion abnormalities which were new
findings. His hypoxia slowly improved until he was stable in
room air.  His course in the Medical Intensive Care Unit was
also complicated by acute renal failure and a mixed gap and
nongap acidosis.  He was called out to the floor on [**2130-11-30**],
in stable condition.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Glipizide 10 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. once daily.
3.  Diltiazem 120 mg p.o. once daily.
4.  Actos 30 mg p.o. once daily.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with wife at home,
enrolled in a day care program, immigrated from [**Male First Name (un) 1056**]
twenty years ago.  Positive smoking history.  Positive remote
alcohol history.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission to the floor
revealed a temperature of 96.0, heart rate 64, blood pressure
110/60, oxygen saturation 95% in room air.  In general, the
patient is easily arousible in no acute distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat - The pupils are equal, round,
and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Moist mucous membranes.  Jugular venous
pressure is seven centimeters.  No lymphadenopathy.  Cardiac
is regular rate and rhythm, II/VI systolic murmur at the left
lower sternal border, no gallops.  The lungs revealed diffuse
expiratory wheezing.  The abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly, normoactive bowel
sounds.  Extremities revealed no edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 13.9, hematocrit
37.8, platelet count 327,000, differential 76% neutrophils,
17% lymphocytes.  Sodium 142, potassium 4.0, chloride 108,
bicarbonate 21, blood urea nitrogen 43, creatinine 2.2,
glucose 256.

Chest x-ray on [**2130-11-30**], showed bilateral interstitial
infiltrates, improved from admission.  Echocardiogram on
[**2130-11-27**], showed ejection fraction of 30 to 35%, regional
left ventricular wall motion abnormalities including an
akinetic apex.  No valvular abnormality.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at 120 beats per
minute, normal axis and intervals, ST depressions in I and
aVL, minimal ST elevations in V2 and V3, ST depressions in V5
and V6, no old electrocardiogram for comparison.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Assessment is that of a 65 year old male
with hypertension and diabetes mellitus presenting with
pneumonia and questionable congestive heart failure.

1.  Community acquired pneumonia - The patient was treated
with antibiotics, Levofloxacin initially and then switched to
Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for progressive hypoxia.  He
never required intubation while in the unit.  He rapidly
improved over a few days and at discharge is stable in room
air.

2.  Congestive heart failure - The patient had bilateral
interstitial infiltrates on examination which were read as
bilateral pneumonia versus congestive heart failure.  An
echocardiogram was obtained on [**2130-11-27**], which showed an
ejection fraction of 30 to 35% and multiple wall motion
abnormalities including apical akinesis.  This cardiomyopathy
has not been previously diagnosed.  Given his low ejection
fraction, he was started on afterload reduction with Isordil
and Hydralazine.  After his renal failure resolved, he was
transitioned to an ace inhibitor and his creatinine has been
stable on low dose ace inhibitor.  He was also started on
beta blocker.  His volume status throughout his admission was
near euvolemic and he was not diuresed after leaving the
unit.  Consideration of anticoagulation for apical akinesis
was brought up, however, on discussion with the primary care
physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was deemed that he was not an anticoagulation
candidate because of a fall risk.  He will be discharged on
his new cardiac regimen to be titrated as an outpatient.

3.  Acute renal failure - Multifactorial - The patient had
baseline renal insufficiency with a creatinine around 1.8.
His peak creatinine was 2.7 during this admission.  The renal
failure was multifactorial.  He was thought to be prerenal
given initial improvement with intravenous fluids.  His CK
was elevated to around 3000 with an unclear etiology with
large blood on dipstick but no red blood cells on microscopy.
It was thought that he might have mild rhabdomyolysis as
well.  His course was also complicated by urinary retention
secondary to Haldol which was given in the unit after an
episode of agitation.  A Foley was placed temporarily but
after removal, the patient had been voiding on his own with
good urine output.  At the time of discharge, his creatinine
is back to his baseline of 1.8.

4.  Acidosis - The patient has mixed gap and nongap acidosis.
Upon admission, his gap acidosis was due to his evolving
peptic physiology at the time of his admission.  His nongap
acidosis resolved after his renal failure resolved.

5.  Diabetes mellitus - The patient is on Glipizide and
Actos.  These were held temporarily due to renal failure and
congestive heart failure but will be resumed as an
outpatient.

6.  Psychiatric issues - The patient has history of mild
dementia and agitation.  He has been on Klonopin as an
outpatient and this was held during his hospitalization.  He
did have an episode of agitation in the Medical Intensive
Care Unit which was blamed on Klonopin withdrawal and the
Klonopin was resumed with subsequent oversedation.
Therefore, on the floor, his Klonopin was held and he has had
no withdrawal symptoms.  We will not discharge the patient on
Klonopin.

7.  Disposition - The patient was evaluated by physical
therapy and deemed safe to return home with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] is
enrolled in a day care program and has done well with this
per the primary care physician.

8.  Code Status - The patient was full code during this
hospitalization.  The patient was discharged home in stable
condition.
