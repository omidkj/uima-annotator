Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1556**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
mesenteric arteriogram with attempted stent placement


History of Present Illness:
41-year-old woman,
who has a very complex medical history. She is a known
vasculopath with history of mesenteric ischemia now with just
greater than 24 hour history of acute onset abdominal pain,
which
was severe, achy, and crampy in nature and was in the left
greater than right lower quadrants. She also noted at least one
or two episodes of bloody stool. Of note, this feels exactly the

same as her most recent bout of mesenteric ischemia for which
she
underwent an exploratory laparotomy and small bowel resection in

[**2122-6-22**]. She has had no fevers or chills, nausea or
vomiting. She has had no food fear or weight loss until recently

after her small bowel resection at [**Hospital6 204**] and
it
turns out she has lost approximately 20 pounds in the last
several weeks.


Past Medical History:
Hypertension, COPD, diabetes mellitus,
coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, ischemic colon
and small intestine, chronic diarrhea, congestive heart failure,

gastroesophageal reflux, hiatal hernia, low back pain with
degenerative joint disease, and ejection fraction of 50-60% with

a dilated atrium.
bilateral carotid
endarterectomies 6 years ago, left carotid subclavian bypass,
coronary artery bypass with mitral valve repair, commissurotomy
2
years ago, subtotal colectomy for ischemia in [**2118**], exploratory
laparotomy, small bowel resection, and 32 cm of resection on
[**2122-6-30**], incarcerated ventral hernia repair with mesh,
L4-L5 fusion, a cholecystectomy and appendectomy.


Social History:
She is a former smoker. She lives alone. She
is retired. She does not drink excessively.


Family History:
Notable for heart disease, rheumatic heart
disease, breast cancer, and colonic polyps.


Physical Exam:
VITAL SIGNS: Pulses in the 90s, blood pressure is 120.
GENERAL: She is alert, oriented and in no acute distress.
HEENT: Normocephalic and atraumatic. Sclerae anicteric. Pupils
were equal, round, reactive to light. Extraocular movements were

intact.
NECK: Supple. No lymphadenopathy. There are no nodules or
bruits.
LUNGS: Clear, except for occasional expiratory wheezes.
HEART: Regular.
ABDOMEN: Soft, with minimal bilateral lower quadrant tenderness,

left greater than right. There is no rebound. There are no
obvious hernias. Guaiac positive with normal tone.
EXTREMITIES: Warm. She has 2+ femoral pulses bilaterally. She
has dopplerable bilateral dorsal pedal pulses.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT 150CC NONIONIC CONTRAST  [**2122-8-8**] 4:26 AM

CT ABD W&W/O C; CT PELVIS W&W/O C

Reason: ? closed loop
Field of view: 40 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
66 year old woman with ? closed loop obstruction
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? closed loop
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 66-year-old female with history of prior ischemic
bowel status post resection. CT in outside hospital demonstrated
very dilated loops of small bowel.

COMPARISONS: Comparison is made to CT performed at an outside
hospital at [**2122-8-7**], at 7 p.m.

TECHNIQUE: 64-MDCT axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were
obtained without IV contrast after administration of IV contrast
(40 seconds and 80 seconds). Nonionic IV contrast was used due
to rapid bolus of this study. 150 cc of Optiray-350 were
administered.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There are
bilateral small pleural effusions. There are no focal
consolidations. There is no pericardial effusion. There is
calcification of the mitral annulus of the heart. The heart is
otherwise of normal size.

No focal lesions are seen in the liver, and there is no
intrahepatic bile duct dilatation. However, the extrahepatic
bile duct measures up to 12 mm and appears in the pancreas.
Correlation with LFTs is recommended.

There is an NG tube with the tip in the stomach. The stomach is
otherwise unremarkable. The spleen and pancreas are
unremarkable. There are several small hypodensities in the
kidneys bilaterally that are too small to characterize (less
than 5 mm). The aorta is heavily calcified. There is stenosis at
the origin of the celiac, and there is likely complete occlusion
or near complete occlusion of the SMA at the origin in an 8-mm
segment. Although contrast filled the distal aspect of the SMA,
this could be due to retrograde filling.

When compared to the prior study, the contrast now reaches the
rectum, and there is no evidence of obstruction or closed loop
obstruction. The small bowel also is less dilated than it was in
the prior study and now no definite thickening of the small
bowel can be appreciated. However, in the prior study performed
approximately 8 hours earlier, there was definite thickening of
the small bowel. Now, there is thickening of a short segment of
colon, which can be seen for example in series 3B, image 152.
There is also mild stranding of the mesentery. There are
postoperative changes in the anterior abdominal wall. There is
no evidence of air in the portal vein or pneumatosis. There is
no free fluid in the abdomen.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH ORAL WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: There
is a Foley catheter within the urinary bladder. The rectum
appears to be unremarkable. The uterus and adnexa are within
normal limits.

BONE WINDOWS: There is a small amount of air in the spinal canal
at the level of L3/L4 likely related to degenerative changes of
no significance. There are severe degenerative changes of the
lumbar spine. There is a cage at the level of L4/L5. No
suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are seen. Another air bubble
is seen in the left SI joint, likely due to degenerative
changes.

CT reformations were important to evaluate the bowel.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval improvement in the degree of dilatation of the
colon, and small bowel. Small bowel thickening cannot be
appreciated anymore but was definitely present in the prior
study performed at the outside hospital. There is no evidence of
small bowel obstruction since the contrast reaches the colon and
the caliber of the small and large bowel are markedly decreased
in size.
2. There is mild stranding of the mesenteric fat.
3. Thickening of a short segment of the colon in the right lower
quadrant could be ischemic.
4. Complete or near complete occlusion of the origin of the SMA
and celiac artery stenosis at the origin. The [**Female First Name (un) 899**] is patent.
Given the patient's history and considering these findigns, the
thickening of the colon in this study could be secondary to
acute ischemia superimposed on chronic ischemic process.
Clinical correlation is recommended.
5. Bilateral pleural effusions.
6. Dilatation of the common bile duct without intrahepatic bile
duct dilatation in this patient status post ch
