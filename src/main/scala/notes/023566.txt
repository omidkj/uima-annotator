Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
ICD firing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 67 year old man with history of CAD s/p
inferolateral MI, CHF (EF <20%), s/p ICD for primary preventions
followed by VT episodes s/p ablation presenting with ICD firing.
He has been feeling well recently until Thursday when he was at
work when he felt lightheaded and had is ICD shock him. He had
another shock Friday at ~8pm while watching TV, a 3rd on Friday
~10pm while in bed and Saturday ~130am while in the ED. Of these
only the first episode was associated with any prodrome of
symptoms. He felt lightheaded and had a burning sensation in his
chest prior to the shock. He contact[**Name (NI) **] the device clinic and was
referred into the ED for evaluation.
.
On arrival to the ED his initial vital signs were 98.6 79 140/72
16 97%RA. He had an episode of VT that was treated with ATP and
shock. He was bolused with amiodarone and started on an
infusion. He was admitted to the CCU for further evaluation.
.
Of note he just was in device clinic on [**2179-6-14**] at which time
the mode was AAIR/DDDR mode, lower rate of 60 beats per minute.
Battery function was intact.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. Occassionally snores,
but no witnessed apneas. All of the other review of systems were
negative.
.

CXR [**2179-6-26**]:
The heart size is moderately enlarged, unchanged. The lungs
demonstrate basilar atelectasis. There is no evidence of
effusion, airspace disease or pneumothorax. An AICD with two
metallic leads overlying the right atrium and right ventricle
are noted.
IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

EKG [**2179-6-26**]:
Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm with ventricular premature
beats.
P-R interval prolongation. Intraventricular conduction delay.
Consider
inferior myocardial infarction. Since the previous tracing of
[**2178-9-23**]
the rate has increased. Ventricular premature beats are more
frequent.
Q-T interval is shorter.

EKG [**2179-6-28**]:
No QT prolongation.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 year old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF <20%) s/p MI
and ICD with subsequent VT s/p ablation, h/o amiodarone-induced
thyrotoxicosis presenting with ICD discharges.
.
VT s/p ICD discharge: Patient had been ablated for VT in the
past.  However, his ICD was interrogated by EP and showed 9
episodes of fast VT with CL 300-320 msec with similar
morphology, some of which responded to ATP while others required
shock.  He likely has scar mediated VT, likely from an inferior
origin.  There were no signs or symptoms suggestive of an acute
ischemic trigger, and patient was continued on his home meds of
ASA, statin, beta blocker, and ACE-I. TFTs and electrolytes were
within normal limits.  The ICD setting was changed from burst to
a more agressive sequence, and his sotalol was increased from
120 mg [**Hospital1 **] to 160 mg [**Hospital1 **]; amiodarone was discontinued as he had
a h/o of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis.  For the rest of his
hospital course, pt remained asymptomatic with several short
runs of NSVT on telemetry but no more significant arrhythmias.
On discharge, pt was stable on sotalol with no need for
amiodarone or ablation at this point; EKG with no QT
prolongation.  He will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1911**].
.
Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis: Endocrine was consulted and
determined that patient's history was most consistent with Type
II AIT in light of his small nonnodular thyroid as well as
absence of previous thyroid disease and antithyroid antibodies.
His TFTs were nl during this admission, and it was determined
that it would be safe to restart the amiodarone if needed since
the risk of AIT recurrence is approximately 10%.  At this time,
the patient is not a candidate for thyroid ablation as he
received a large iodine load from the initial amiodarone bolus.
However, if amiodarone is restarted in the future, prophylactic
thyroid ablation with radioiodine should be considered.  Pt will
follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
