Admission Date:  [**2133-1-11**]              Discharge Date:   [**2133-2-10**]

Date of Birth:  [**2059-10-24**]             Sex:   M

Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p Aortic valve replacement (23mm [**Company **] mosaic ultra tissue
valve), Mitral valve replacement (29mm [**Company **] mosaic porcine
valve) on [**2133-2-3**]


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 73 year old man with aortic stenosis, atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, recently status post "significant"
mycardial infarction ([**2132-11-28**]), intervention complicationed by
left hand/leg weakness consistant with a cerebral vascular event
who now presents with dyspnea.

Following his cerebral vascular incident at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital
three weeks ago, he was discharged to rehab on [**2132-12-3**] and
reportedly did well and was recently sent home in beginning of
[**Month (only) 404**]. Since then he has noted two to three weeks of cough,
but no fevers, chills, or nightsweats. His cough was initially
dry, but became productive yesterday. He also began to complain
of progressive dyspnea on exertion for two days.

In the emergency department, his initial vital signs were: T
95.8 -> 102 Pulse 93 Blood Pressure 94/67 Respirations 30
93%Room Air Oxygen Saturation. Lactate  was 1.2. He spiked a
fever to 102.3. His chest radiograph showed a possible right
lower lobe infiltrate. He was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn
for hospital acquired pneumonia and given a total of two liters
of normal saline to help maintain a systolic blood pressure in
the low to mid 90's. His blood pressure at times dipped to
88/30mmHg. He also was given nebs, tylenol 1 gm X 1, and
Robitussin once.

On the floor, he complained of dyspnea on exertion and shortness
of breath. Of note, he seemed to report a gradual worsening of
symptoms over last 6-8 months and nothing acute brought him to
hospital today (besides sons urging him to come in). Review of
systems was positive for paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and
orthopnea (for past 2 months he has needed to sleep vertically).
At best, he can climb one flight of stairs but gets extremely
short of breath and needs to rest 20 minutes.  An echocardiogram
revealed moderate aortic stenosis with a valve area of [**12-11**].2 cm,
2+ aortic regurgitation, svere mitral regurgitation, and mild
mitral stenosis.  He was referred to cardiac surgery for
evaluation for replacement of his aortic and mitral valves.

Past Medical History:
atrial fibrillation on coumadin
rheumatic heart disease with moderate aortic stenosis, aortic
regurgitation, mitral regurgitation and right atrial pressure.
emphysema: asbestos exposure
peripheral vascular disease status post carotid endarterectomy
recent myocardial infarction with catheterization lab
intervention:
left body stroke  ([**11-17**])
cough
s/p gastrointestinal bleed with melena
prostate cancer s/p radiation


Social History:
The patient has 9 children by his first wife who is deceased. He
has been married to his current wife for 4 years. He is a
retired firefighter for 30 years and for the early years of
fighting fires, he often did not wear a mask. He smoked a
quarter of a pack a day for 20 years, but quit 27-years-ago. He
was, in fact, exposed to asbestos in his job as a firefighter.
He does not drink.

Family History:
Non-contributory

Physical Exam:
General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, JVP at 15cm, no LAD
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales,
ronchi
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema

[**2133-1-11**] PORTABLE UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: The
cardiomegaly is stable. Small right pleural effusion and right
basilar consolidation are unchanged since the recent chest CT.
Mild perihilar vascular congestion is noted. The overlying soft
tissue and osseous structures appear unremarkable.
.
EKG [**2133-1-11**]: irreg, irreg, rate 90bpm, nl axis, nl intervals, no
ST changes, TW flattening i, AVL, II,II, AVF, peaked T's in
lateral lead unchanged from prior. Compared to prior EKG, TW
flattening in I/AVL and inf leads.
.
[**2133-1-8**] Chest CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Signs of mild heart failure with diffuse minimal septal
thickening and ground glass opacities.
2. Widespread heterogeneous attenuation, could be in part
explained by airtrapping.
3. Signs of previous rheumatic heart disease with mitral annulus
and severe aortic valve calcification. Calcification in the left
atrial appendage, likely due to old thrombus.
4. Signs of small airway disease. Right middle lobe opacities
could be atelectasis or pneumonia, should be correlated with
clinical information.
5. Signs of anemia.
6. Very minimal thickening of the left anterior pleura, could be
due to asbestos exposure.
7. New bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and
small on the left, likely due to heart failure.
8. Stable mediastinal lymph nodes since [**2130**], likely benign.
.
ECHO [**2133-1-12**]: The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferolateral wall. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50 %). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (AoVA = 1.0cm2). Mild to
moderate ([**12-12**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets and supporting structures are moderately thickened.
There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial
mitral stenosis. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-1-9**],
the severity of mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis have
increased. Pulmonary artery hypertension and mild regional left
ventricular systolic function are now present.

Cardiac Catheterization Study Date of [**2133-1-21**]
COMMENTS:
1. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated elevated right sided
filling
pressures (RA 25 mm Hg), severe pulmonary artery hypertension
(PA 95/42
mm Hg), elevated left sided filling pressures (LVEDP 27 mm Hg),
and
systemic arterial hypotension (central aortic pressure 95/52 mm
Hg). The
cardiac output/index was low, consistent with cardiogenic shock
(CO 2.9
l/min and CI 1.5 l/min/m2).  There was no improvement in the
cardiac
output/cardiac index with dobutamine (CO 2.6 l/min and CI 1.4
l/min/m2).
Evalation of the mitral valve demonstrated a mean gradient
between the
PCWP and LV of 17 mm Hg which translates to MV area 0.68 cm2.
Evaluation of the aortic valve area demonstrated a mean gradient
of 20
mm Hg which translates to AV area 0.62 cm2.  Dobutamine was
infused in
an attempt to increased cardiac output and re-evaluate the
transaortic
gradient, however there was no significant increase in cardiac
output or
transaortic gradient with this maneuver.
2. Peripheral angiography revealed AV fistula at site of femoral
venous
and arterial access.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe mitral stenosis with regurgitation of uncertain
severity.
2. Moderate aortic stenosis.
3. Severe pulmonary hypertension.
4. Severely
