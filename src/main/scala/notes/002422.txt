History of Present Illness:
87 year-old female with COPD, Alzheimers, prior ESBL UTI,
non-verbal at baseline, transferred from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with
fever, tachypnea, and hypoxia. She has had productive cough,
fever to 103 x2 days. On day prior to admission, chest
radiograph was negative for infiltrate, and she was started on
levofloxacin for concern for aspiration pneumonia. Received
several neb treatments without relief, and morphine 4mg IV x1

cough. Prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], 101.6, RR 42, 90% NRB. Per
call-in sheet, had pneumococcal vaccination [**2192-7-13**], no record
of influenza vaccination, and prior ESBL UTI. Also on aspiration
precautions.
.
Of note, she was inpatient [**Date range (1) 93603**] for COPD exacerbation,
pyelonephritis, and [**Last Name (un) **] secondary to urinary retention. She was
treated initially with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone
and transitioned to Bactrim on discharge.
.
In the ED, 99.5 78 107/56 40 100%NRB. Triggered for tachypnea.
Physical examination notable for dyspnea, use of accessory
muscles, and diffuse rhonchi on auscultation. Laboratory data
significant for WBC 7.7, hematocrit 32.6, normal chemistry
panel, troponin-T 0.03; lactate 1.1; positive UA. CXR reportedly
unremarkable for acute process. EKG with NSR 90, PVC/PAC, no
evidence of ischemia. Received vancomycin, Zosyn, levofloxacin;
Duonebs; solumedrol; IVF 1.5L NS. On transfer to MICU, RR
improved to 20s; 81, 94/55, 29, 95% 6L NC. Access PIV x1. Prior

.
In the MICU, patient is nonverbal. She responds to daughter's
voice.

Imaging
[**2195-4-6**] - TTE
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area
1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-1**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.

[**2195-4-11**] RUE Doppler
No evidence of DVT in the right upper extremity.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
87yo F w COPD on chronic prednisone, Alzheimer's, prior ESBL
UTI, non-verbal at baseline, a/w fever and respiratory distress,
now s/p intubation for hypoxia, found to have UTI and flu swab
positive for Influenza A, now s/p tamiflu, abx for HCAP,
extubated, stable, discharged to rehab.
.
ACTIVE
# Influenza / Health Care Associated Pneumonia / COPD
Exacerbation:  Patient was a/w fever and acute respiratory
distress, with positive nasal swab for influenza.  Patient sent
to ICU for hypoxia requiring intubation.  She treated with
oseltamivir, as well as azithro/vanco/meropenem for presumed
HCAP (given h/o ESBL Ecoli).  Course was complicated by presumed
COPD exacerbation, for which the patient had chronic steroids
increased to stress doses.  Respiratory status improved and
patient was extubated.  Patient completed eight day course of
vancomycin and meropenem, five day course azithromycin, five day
course oseltamivir.  She was continued on nebulizers.
.
# UTI: UA on admission suggestive of UTI; given h/o ERBL Ecoli
colonization w indwelling foley, patient started on empiric
coverage (as described above).
.
# End-Stage Alzheimers Demetia: Patient at baseline is nonverbal
with poor functional status.  Post-extubation she passed a
speech and swallow examination to return to baseline diet ground
solids / nectar liquids.  Given end-stage dementia, patient
condition is likely expected to continue to deteriorate.  Family
was counseled on this, and that complications from aspir
