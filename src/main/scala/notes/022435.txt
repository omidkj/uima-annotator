Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 17865**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 year old female with COPD, h/o RUL lobectomy
for locally advanced adenocarcinoma who presented with worsening
SOB at her nursing home.  She was given albuterol an she became
hypoxic to the low 80s and she became tachycardic.  She had also
been noted to be in ARF.  She was given 40 mg of predisone and
then was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, she was noted to be in mild to moderate
respiratory distress.  Her vitals were T 97.7, HR 149, BP
119/80, RR 34, 98% on NRB.  A CXR was performed which showed no
pneumonia.  She had coarse breath sounds throughout and
expiratory wheezes.  She was given 1 g of Vancomycin and 125 mg
of methlyprednisolone.  Blood cultures were sent.  She is
currently satting well on 4LNC with RR 20s-30s, able to speak in
full sentences.  Her EKG shows atrial flutter in the 140s.  She
was not given any nodal agents in the ED due to concern for
early sepsis.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, patient reports shortness of breath.
She is unable to provide much history due to dementia.  She
denies chest pain, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhe,
constipation, or any other concerning symptoms.
.
Of note, patient was recently hospitalized from [**8-15**] to [**8-18**] for
pneumonia and COPD flare which was treated with azithromycin and
nebs, and IV steroids.  Her prednisone dose had been tapered to
Prednisone 15 mg every other day on [**2118-8-26**].


Past Medical History:
- Lung Adeno Ca s/p chemoradiotherapy (chemo including
taxotere/carboplatin) and right upper lobectomy, radical lymph
node dissection (nodes positive by direct extension only), and
resection of tumor involving thoracic vertebral bodies [**2113-6-3**].

- COPD (last [**Location (un) **] [**2115**]; FEV1 41% predicted) on home O2 (2LPM)
- Paroxysmal Afib, first found [**4-/2117**], not on anticoagulation
- History of multifocal atrial tachycardia
- History of aspiration pneumonia [**4-/2117**]
- History of respiratory failure (thought multifactorial due to
pulmonary edema, COPD, and pneumonia) requiring
intubation/mechanical vent [**3-/2116**]
- h/o DVT; evidence of chronic PE on past CTAs
- Hypercholesterolemia
- Hypertension
- GERD
- +PPD
- Type 2 Diabetes
- Mild Dementia
- Cataract surgery [**2118-8-10**]


Social History:
Lives at [**Hospital3 **]. Separated from husband.  One living son.
 Former [**Name2 (NI) 1818**], quit in [**2097**] after smoking 1.5-2 PPD x ~40 years
(60-80 pack years). No current EtOH use though reported drinking
in past. Worked in a meat market (wrapping meat) during her
life.  No occupational or recreational exposures.  No pets in
recent years.  No asbestos exposure.  Denies TB exposure though
was PPD positive in past per notes.

Family History:
No known lung disease, though reports mother died at 53 of
"blood clot" unclear if PE.

Imaging:
CXR - low lung volumes on the right, no pneumonia.
Echo.
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-3-18**], no
change.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is an 80 yo female with COPD, HTN, HL, DM, who was
discharged two weeks ago for COPD flare and discharged on a
prednisone taper who was admitted for shortness of breath likely
due to COPD flare and aspiration.
.
Shortness of breath.  Patient presents with COPD flare in
setting of steroid taper.  Additionally, aspiration likely
contributed to her shortness of breath.  After a speech and
swallow evaluation, her diet was modified to thickened liquids
and soft solids.  She did not require more than 4LNC during her
hospital stay.  She was treated with IV solumedrol but this was
soon transitioned to oral steroids.  She was sent home on an
short steroid taper as this was not felt to be a severe flare
and her oxygen requirements and tachypnea did not appear to be
sigificantly worse than hre baseline.  Additionally, she was
given azithromycin and nebulizes for her COPD.  Lastly, she was
very tachycardic to 180s on arrival and her shortness of breath
improved with improved rate control.
.
Tachycardia.  Patient has A. fib with RVR and was initially
tachycardic to the 180s.  She responded to IV diltiazem, her
home oral nodal agents (diltiazem, lopressor) and intravenous
fluids.  Her HR was in the 70s at time of discharge.
.
Renal failure.  Patient presented with pre-renal acute renal
failure that resolved with intravenous fluids.  Her creatinine
fell from 1.5 to 1.0 with fluids.
