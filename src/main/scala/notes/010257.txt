Service:  ICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old male with
complex cardiac history including coronary artery disease,
status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2104**] with
multiple percutaneous interventions, Instent stenosis as well
as brachytherapy, congestive heart failure, ejection fraction
of 42%, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gastrointestinal bleed,
CVA, weakness, dementia.  The patient originally presented to
the hospital on [**2125-11-9**] with complaints of slow
onset of left shoulder pain, about [**4-1**] that radiated to the
back associated with shortness of breath, but without nausea,
vomiting or palpitations; somewhat similar to his past
angina.  Patient was given aspirin at home and brought to the
Emergency Room by EMS.

In the Emergency Room, he received nitropaste, Lopressor,
morphine, tramadol and had some improvement in his symptoms.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for a lack of fevers and
chills, non-productive cough with a head cold without
shortness of breath.  Positive peripheral burning neuropathy,
no dysuria, no hematuria, no sick exposures, no lower
extremity edema, no orthopnea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
    bypass graft in [**2104**] (graft right saphenous vein graft to
    left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to ramus to
    OM and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending
    artery), complicated by Instent restenoses of the
    saphenous vein graft to left anterior descending in [**2117**],
    saphenous vein graft to ramus and OM in [**2121-10-22**]
    with subsequent stent placement which was then further
    complicated by Instent stenoses treated by percutaneous
    transluminal coronary angioplasty and brachytherapy in
    [**2120**].  Last cardiac catheterization was [**2122-12-4**]
    which revealed significant native three vessel disease,
    with patent saphenous vein graft to left anterior
    descending with 40-50% Instent restenoses, saphenous vein
    graft to ramus to OM with ostial 70% Instent restenoses
    and 80% Instent restenoses and proximal stent, as well as
    50% stenoses distally in the saphenous vein graft,
    saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery
    totally occluded.  Patient underwent brachytherapy of
    Instent restenoses and saphenous vein graft to ramus to
    OM, as well as atherectomy and percutaneous transluminal
    coronary angioplasty of Instent restenoses of saphenous
    vein graft ramus to OM.
2.  Congestive heart failure.  Last echocardiogram during
    this admission, [**2125-10-22**], ejection fraction 40-45%
    with anterolateral akinesis, posterior hypokinesis.
3.  1+ AI.
4.  Mitral regurgitation.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Hyperlipidemia.
7.  Question of CVA in [**2121**].

    esophageal erosion in [**2124-11-22**], treated with
    embolization.
10. Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
11. Spastic bladder.
12. Gait disorder, multifactorial, wheelchair bound status
    with progressive functional decline over the past one
    year.
13. Urinary tract infection.
14. Esophagitis.
15. Question of buccal facial apraxia.  New on this
    admission.
16. Frontotemporal dementia, not Parkinson's per Neurology.
17. History of strangulated abdominal hernia and repair.
18. Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter during this
    admission.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:  Vital signs:
Pulse 75.  Blood pressure 149/63.  Respiratory rate 25.
Oxygen saturation 3 liters nasal cannula with 95% oxygen
saturation.  General:  Chronically ill-appearing elderly
male.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal,
round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.
No conjunctival injection.  Oropharynx with thick white
secretions posteriorly.  Mucous membranes are dry.  Neck:  No
lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous distention, no
hepatojugular reflux, no carotid bruits.  Cardiovascular:  No
heave, no thrills, point of maximal impulses laterally
displaced and diffuse, regular rate and rhythm with
occasional premature ventricular contractions, 3+
holosystolic murmur at left upper sternal border.  Pulmonary:
Expiratory wheezes half way down bilaterally.  Crackles one
third of the way up on the right, decreased breath sounds
half way up on the left.  Abdomen:  Positive distention,

extremities.  Neurological:  2+ reflexes throughout.

LABORATORY DATA AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION:  White blood cell
count 9.2, hematocrit 37.2, platelets 185,000.  Differential:
 Neutrophils 84%, lymphocytes 11%, monocytes 4%, eosinophils
.3%, basophils .2%.  Sodium 131, potassium 4.8, chloride 97,
bicarbonate 29, BUN 26, creatinine 0.6, CK 86, troponin of
.02.

Chest x-ray:  Mild cardiomegaly compared to prior films,
perihilar haziness, elevated left hemidiaphragmatic (old),
small left pleural effusion consistent with mild congestive
heart failure.

Electrocardiogram:  Normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation,
left ventricular hypertrophy, left anterior fascicular block,
left atrial enlargement, down sloping ST segments 1 mm in I,
aVL, V2, V3 with small ST depressions in V5 and V6 less than
a mm, T wave inversions in I, aVL, biphasic T wave in II.  In
comparison with an electrocardiogram dated [**2124-12-7**],
the patient's electrocardiogram at the time of admission
appeared to be improved in terms of the ST segment, T wave
inversion were normalizing V2 to V6.  In relation with an
electrocardiogram done in [**2124-10-22**], the ST
depressions are new.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  By system:

1.  Cardiovascular:

Ischemia:  The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction at
the start of his admission.  It was thought that his initial
shoulder pain was more related to a pulmonary process versus
a cardiac process.  He subsequently was maintained on
aspirin, beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor, doses of which were
variable throughout his hospital course based on his blood
pressure and other ongoing medical issues. It was told to us
that patient does not tolerate statins or Plavix and he was
not maintained on these medications.

Pump:  Patient had an echocardiogram on this admission that
showed an ejection fraction of 40-45% consistent with
systolic congestive heart failure.  His hospital course was
notable for increasing blood pressures 200/100s soon after
his admission with associated shortness of breath and oxygen
desaturations to 92% on a nonrebreather. This was thought to
be consistent with flash pulmonary edema. Patient was
diuresed subsequently hypotensive requiring a dopamine drip
and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for closer
monitoring, as well as a question aspiration event.  Patient
was treated with a nitroglycerin drip and Lasix and did have
an electrocardiogram that showed ST depressions in the
anterior lateral leads thought to be secondary to demand
ischemia.  He was subsequently in the Coronary Care Unit,
however, his course was then complicated by persistent
hypoxia from pneumonia and his blood cultures grew out 3-4
bottles of Methicillin sensitive staph aureus. Patient
required intubation on [**2124-11-22**] and was subsequently
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit Service after
an episode of hypotension with systolic blood pressures down
to the 60s.  He was subsequently started on a neo drip, given
fluid boluses, extubated on [**11-29**] and transferred to the
floor and then re-intubated on [**12-2**] in the setting of
an aspiration event, desaturations, when he was found
unresponsive with a weak cough.  At that time, the patient
was then transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive C
