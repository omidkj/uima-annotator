Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**]
Chief Complaint:
DOE - Hodgkin's Lyphoma


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Chest Tube Placement/VATS


History of Present Illness:
This is a 38 yo female with nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's
lymphoma (diagnosed in [**2123**]) that involves her lungs, who
presents with worsening respiratory function. She notes that
since [**Month (only) 216**] she has had increasing DOE on exertion and is
followed by her oncologist at an OSH for this. Her dyspnea
became worse in [**Month (only) **] and she has been unable to lie flat on
her back since that time. In [**Month (only) 359**] fo [**2129**] she was admitted to
OSH for pneumonia and treated with abx. Her respiratory symptoms
continued. She was noted to have a left pleural effusion by
x-ray and this was tapped in [**2130-10-26**]. At that time only
200cc of dark fluid was removed (per the patient) and this did
not relieve her symptoms at all. More recently in the past two
weeks she has been increasingly SOB with standing and walking.
She notes that she is usually able to breath normally while
lying on her side of sitting up in bed, but this has gotten
worse in the past week. She does have an occasional productive
cough "when I get excited" and produces clear sputum. This cough
has been present since [**2130-6-26**]. She states that
approximately 2 weeks ago she had a low grade temp and was
treated for two weeks with Avelox (this was stopped on [**1-2**]). The
Avelox helped her dyspnea for the first week, but her symptoms
got worse during the second week of treatment.  She also notes
that approximately one week ago she developed a gastroenteritis
(which she got from her son), and had two days of
nausea/vomiting and diarrhea that have resolved.  She was seen
in clinic today and noted to have DOE with walking short
distances, RR 40 and hypotension with BPs 82/64. Her O2 sat was
95% at rest. She is normally seen at an OSH and per reports PFTs
showed FEV1 of 0.8 (25% of expected). She was also noted to have
a fever, she thinks to 101.0. She was given a 500 cc NS bolus,
blood cultures were drawn, and she was treated with vancomycin
and ceftriaxone. Currently she is SOB with speaking but feels
better since she has been placed on 4 L NC O2.

On ROS: She denies N/V, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation,
rashes, sore throat, dysuria, hematuria, abnormal vaginal
discharge.
(+) for daily CP midsternal and under right breast (since [**Month (only) **]
[**2129**])
(+) cough, described above
(+) night sweats when she takes vicodin
(+) pain in her bones (in her back mostly) for which she takes
vcodin


Past Medical History:
1. Hodgkin's lymphoma (stage IIA, diagnosed in [**2123**] -
nodular sclerosing) (see above for details)
2. Splenectomy in [**2126**].
3. h/o herpes zoster.
4. per prior notes has history of Fen-Phen use.
5. Clot in left SVC that resulted in swelling of left breast,
should be taking coumadin for this but stopped taking it last
friday b/c she was upset
6. left pleural effusion

Oncology History: Diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, nodular
sclerosing) in [**2123**]. The patient initially was treated with
Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine with subsequent
disease recurrence.  Transplant was deferred at that time, and
the patient received four cycles of CEPT. She also received
radiation therapy as part of initial treatment for six weeks.
She had an autologous BMT in 4/[**2128**]. In [**2-/2130**] (about one year
post transplant) a CT evaluation revealed recurrent disease in
her chest and abdomen. Anterior mediastinal adenopathy was in
the field of prior radiation. She underwent a biopsy of her
anterior mediastinal adenopathy that revealed recurrent
Hodgkin's lymphoma. She was then treated with CEPP chemotherapy.
She had a variable response to CEPP and was started most
recently on Rituxan and Vinblastine.



Social History:
The patient is single. She has an 11-year-old son. [**Name (NI) **] tobacco or
ETOH use.
She works occasionally in a convenient store.


Family History:
Mother passed away from a myocardial infarction. Father
diagnosed just recently with pancreatic, liver and colon CA
(primary ca not known)-also states father has cancer from
asbestos

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
[**2131-1-10**] CXR - Large amount of left pleural fluid which is worse
in comparison to the previous study. Small amount of right
pleural fluid - unchanged in comparison to the previous film. No
evidence of pulmonary edema. The patient is status post
splenectomy.

[**2131-1-11**] Chest CT - Large left pleural effusion responsible for
near-complete collapse of the left lung. Small right pleural
effusion. Minimal pleural nodularity, but no evidence of
loculation.  Extensive prevascular lymphadenopathy extending to
and destroying portions of the sternum, left 1st through 3rd
anterior ribs, and other left anterior chest wall structures.
Superior mediastinal lymphadenopathy with mild narrowing of the
trachea at the thoracic inlet. No other vital structures
compromised.
Right supraclavicular, paratracheal, subcarinal, paraesophageal,
and diaphragmatic lymphadenopathy.

[**2131-1-12**] Echo - The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. An echo dense mass is noted anterior to
the heart/right ventricle outside the pericardial space.

[**2131-1-14**] Unilateral breast U/S - No fluid collections.

[**2131-1-14**] Abd U/S - Gallbladder sludge. Otherwise normal abdominal
ultrasound. Right pleural effusion.

[**2131-1-14**] Unilateral L upper ext U/S - Abnormal finding in the
left internal jugular area likely representing a necrotic lymph
node and adjacent patent diminutive internal jugular vein.
Alternatively, if the patient has had prior procedures or
radiation, this may represent chronic fibrosis with focal
chronic thrombus. If clinically indicated, this may be further
evaluated with a contrast-enhanced neck CT.

[**2131-1-16**] CTA - No pulmonary embolism.  Interval improved aeration
of the left lung. No consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
Unchanged bilateral masses and chest wall mass consistent with
known metastatic disease

[**2131-1-17**] CTA - No pulmonary embolism.  Interval improved aeration
of the left lung. No consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
Unchanged bilateral masses and chest wall mass consistent with
known metastatic disease.

[**2131-1-20**] CXR - Overall stable appearance of the chest with no
pneumothorax identified. Stable position of the left chest tube.

[**2131-1-21**] CT Abdomen - Marked retroperitoneal and retrocrural
lymphadenopathy. Two soft tissue density nodules within the
mesentery adjacent to the small bowel also likely represent
areas of disease involvement. No bowel obstruction. Stable
appearance of extensive lymphadenopathy within the chest. Two
millimeter hypodensity within the right posterior segment of the
liver, too small to fully characterize.

[**2131-1-25**] CXR - Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions are
