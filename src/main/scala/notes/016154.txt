CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2149-2-15**]:
1. Left lower lobe pneumonia.
2. Slight increase in small bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Stable cardiomegaly.
.
ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY)  [**2149-2-18**]:
FINDINGS: The liver shows no focal or textural abnormality.
There is no biliary dilatation and the common duct measures 0.4
cm. Note is made of a linear echogenic structure within the
gallbladder fossa which most likely represents a surgical clip.
The gallbladder is noted to have been surgically removed. The
portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. The visualized
portion of the pancreas is unremarkable however the pancreas is
mostly obscured by overlying bowel gas. The spleen is
unremarkable and measures 9.3 cm. Both right and left kidneys
show no hydronephrosis and no solid masses. The right kidney
measures 10.4 cm and the left kidney measures 10.0 cm. The renal
cortex is noted to be thinned bilaterally. The aorta is not well
visualized on this exam.
IMPRESSION: Unremarkable abdominal ultrasound.

URINE CULTURE (Final [**2149-2-17**]):    NO GROWTH

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted for treatment of his left lower lobe
pneumonia.

# fever/pneumonia
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was started on levoquin. His chills and shortness
of breath resolved. His WBC count improved as well as his lung
exam. His dry cough improved during his hospital course, it was
not productive of sputum and no sputum cultures were sent. His
urine culture was negative and blood cultures demonstrate no
growth to date at the time of discharge. He was afebrile for >48
hours at the time of discharge. He was discharge to finish a 7
day course of levoquin.
.
# loose stools:
Upon admission to the hospital, Mr. [**Known lastname **] did not have
another episode of loose stools.
.
#CAD s/p CABG with h/o of MI in [**2149-1-11**]. on telemetry
He had elevated troponin however has had no change in his EKG
and was asymptomatic for MI. He was placed on telemetry and had
no cardiac complaints during his hospital course. He was
continued on aspirin, plavix, metoprolol; he was also started on
atorvostatin for his h/o CAD, with LDL goal <70. He was seen by
cardiothoracic surgery who evaluated his scars/wounds; he had no
acute surgical issues. His left popliteal graft harvest site has
been healing well with secondary intention with no evidence of
erythema, purulent drainage, or induration. It was cleaned with
normal saline daily, dressed with bacitracin and daily dry gauze
dressing changes. As his creatinine normalized, he was started
on lisinopril given his history of coronary artery disease.
.
# CHF, chronic systolic.
He appeared to be overall volume overloaded given his BLE edema,
however was depleted intravascularly. He was gently rehydrated
with IVF and had no evidence of worsening heart failure during
his hospital course. His BLE edema improved with elevation,
despite discontinuation of lasix because of increased
creatinine. He can be restarted on lasix if needed as his
creatinine tolerates.
.
# HTN
Blood pressure was slightly elevated on admission in the
150s/80s-90s so metoprolol was increased from 150mg to 200mg
daily. After this increased in metoprolol, his blood pressure
remained in an excellent range, <120/80.
.
# Urinary retention
Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed urinary retention on hospital day 2; he
was unable to urinate despite having the urge to do so. He has a
h/o an enlarged prostate but denied h/o recent urinary
complaints (no dysuria, no dribbling, no difficulty in starting
stream, no frequency). He mentioned a h/o a procedure 30 years
ago where physicians "took scrapings of the prostate" but he has
not had problems since then; he denies ever being told he has
cancer. He is followed by his primary care provider for the
enlarged prostate. He was discharged with a foley in place. He
has an appointment with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 770**], Urologist, a
