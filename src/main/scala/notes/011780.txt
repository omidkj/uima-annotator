Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 69390**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 65-year-old former smoker with a history of
dyslipidemia, HTN, poorly controlled DM2, CKD, hypothyroidism,
asthma, OSA, and morbid obese who presents with dyspnea and
chest pain and is admitted for management of ?ACS.
.
She was in her usual state of health until two weeks ago when
she began waking up with chest pain in the setting of blood
glucose >500 and also one or two days after her physician
advised her to stop her lasix. She described her CP as pressure,
tightness, sometimes radiating to her neck, and resolves with
improvement of her glucose. She also notes that she has had
worsening DOE since stopping her lasix, and that her CP was
associated with aggravation of this symptom. She is on insulin
and states that her usual a.m. glucose is 15-200; it does fall
after administration of insulin. ROS pos for orthopnea and PND.
She denies fevers, chills, n/v/d, dysuria, and other localizing
signs of infection. At baseline, she is very active, works two
jobs, and ambulates without CP or dyspnea.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were 98.6 75 147/68 18 100%/RA.
EKG with ST-depressions in I, aVL slightly more pronounced than
prior EKGs. Trop was 0.64 and she was started on a heparin gtt
empirically for ACS; aspirin was not given b/c she has a hives
allergy to the medication. She was guaiac negative.
.
On the floor, she is CP free and speaking on the phone with her
son.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CXR: FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were
obtained. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or evidence
of pneumothorax is seen. The cardiac silhouette is top normal.
No overt pulmonary edema is seen. Degenerative changes are noted
along the spine. IMPRESSION: Top normal cardiac silhouette
without overt pulmonary edema.

Cardiac Catherization:
1. Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system
demonstrated three vessel disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent disease. The LAD had a 90% mid
stenosis. The LCx had a 90% mid stenosis involving an OM branch.
The RCA was diffusely diseased and occluded in its mid portion.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left-sided
filling presures with RVEDP 16mmHg and LVEDP 34mmHg. There was
moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 48mmHg. The
cardiac index was preserved at 3.2 L/min/m2. The systemic and
pulmonary vascular resistances were normal at 1168 and 114
dynes-sec/cm5 respectively. There was mild systemic arterial
hypertension with SBP 144mmHg and DBP 78mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
3. Elevated left- and right-sided filling pressures.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 65-year-old former smoker with a history of
dyslipidemia, HTN, poorly controlled DM2, CKD, hypothyroidism,
asthma, OSA, and morbid obese who presents with dyspnea and
chest pain and is admitted for management of ?ACS.
.
# CORONARIES/?NSTEMI: patient with several risk factors for CAD
but no known diagnosis. Chest pain is atypical in quality with
hyperglycemia as aggravating factor but not clearly associated
with exertion. Major process driving symptoms seems to be
worsening dyspnea in the setting of likely volume overload. DDx
for chest pain also includes PE, pulm edema/heart failure, pna,
pleurisy, and GERD.
Patient ruled out for an MI, but an ECHO done in hosiptal
demonstrated regional systolic dysfunction suggestive of
multivessel CAD. For this reason patient was transferred to the
CCU for aspirin allergy desensitization prior to Cardiac
Catherization. Pt had ASA desensitization in CCU, which she
tolerated without event. She went for RHC and LHC, which
revealed elevated filling pressures with mean wedge 26.
Additionally, pt had 3VD, and no intervention was pursued, with
recommended CABG. She tolerated the procedure well without
complications. However, CK was checked in cath for unclear
reasons and was found to be elevated. CE's showed elevated MB
and trops when added on. However, on recheck they were
downtrending. She was without chest pain and ECG was unchanged.
The decision was made to manage this patient's coronary artery
disease medically and defer discussion of CABG till a later time
point. Patient was started on plavix and diltiazem.

INACTIVE ISSUES:
.
# DM2/hyperglycemia: has chronically poorly controlled BG and
worsened control for the past two weeks with values >400. No
localizing signs of infection.  Diabetic diet, ISS, finger
sticks
.
# ?Acute heart failure/pulm edema: patient reports worsening
dyspnea on exertion since stopping lasix per her PCP; notes
lasix was stopped b/c of rising creatinine. CXR supports mild
volume overload. Patient's lasix was restarted with stable
cratinine of 1.8-1.9.
.
# HTN:
- continued home meds.
.
# ?Acute vs chronic kidney disease: patient states she has had
CKD for a few years but does not know baseline creatinine. On
[**Name (NI) **], unclear whether current creatinine represents acute kidney
injury. states that CKD may have worsened after a colonoscopy in
[**1-10**] for which she was given citrate of magnesia for a prep; not
clear this medication associated with renal impairment.
.
# Dyslipidemia: continued statin
.
# Hypothyroidism:
- continue levoxyl
.
# OSA:- cpap

Transitional Issues: Three vessel disease - patient is to follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6512**] regarding medical management of her CAD.
