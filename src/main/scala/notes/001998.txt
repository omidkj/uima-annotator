CT ABDOMEN:IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence for retroperitoneal bleed.
2.  Retained fecal material with heterogeneous density within
the distal
rectum, likely stool.  Clinical correlation is advised.

CXR:
FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in
supine
position is analyzed in comparison with a similar preceding
study of [**2141-8-1**].  Noted is the placement of a right-sided
PICC line which is seen to terminate overlying the SVC at the
level of the carina.  This line was not present on the preceding
examination.  A previously present NG tube, however, has been
removed.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is now markedly
increased haze around the pulmonary vasculature on the left side
which was not present on the preceding examination.  The same
increase most likely is also present in the right side but less
well seen because of the patient's partial rotation.  When
comparing this findings with the next preceding study, the most
likely explanation is that the patient has become overhydrated.
Otherwise, the possibility of pulmonary congestion must be
entertained.  There is, however, no evidence of pleural effusion
as the lateral pleural sinuses remain free.  No new discrete
parenchymal infiltrates are identified.

VIDEO SWALLOW:IMPRESSION:  Moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia,
with penetration and aspiration with thin liquids.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 45 yo female with a seizure disorder who came in
on [**2141-7-15**] with constipation refractory to medical therapy.

1. Constipation:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was manually disinpacted x 2 on [**2141-7-15**] with removal
of moderate amounts of [**Male First Name (un) 1658**] stool.  Serial KUB showed improving
impaction.  Her interaction improved to closer to baseline
according to her sister.  She had a negative c.diff toxin assay
x 2. With aggressive medical management in addition, including
bisacodyl, lactulose, and senna, and an NG tube to help with PO,
she began to stool on her own.  She was transfered with
bisacodyl pr, lactulose pr prn, and docusate standing [**Hospital1 **].

2. Seizures:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was noted to have seizure activity on [**2141-7-16**].  Neuro
was consulted and recommended making her Zonegran brand name and
giving her TID low dose Ativan with prn.  On [**2141-7-17**], continued
seizure activity was noted per Neuro and patient was transferred
to the Neuro service.  The patient's zonegran and keppra were
maintained at pre-transfer/at home doses.  The ativan was
increased to a maximum of 3mg 5 times/day until her seizures
finally abated.  Doses twice had to be held for low blood
pressure.  The ativan was then slowly withdrawn.  At discharge,
the patient is now off the standing ativan order and only has
ativan ordered for breakthrough seizures.  She has been seizure
free on her regimen for over 10 days.  Her hypotensive episodes
also resolved once the Ativan was stopped. She did have one [**1-11**]
