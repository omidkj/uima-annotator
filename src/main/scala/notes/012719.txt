History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17157**] is a 85 y/o man living at [**Hospital **] rehab admitted on
[**1-3**] to the medical service after presenting to the emergency
department with shortness of breath. He was foudn to be in
moderate respiratory distress, with evidence of fluid overload
on a chest xray. He was hypertensive and had chest pain. He was
breifly on bipap and diuresed wiht IV lasix. He was weaned from
Bipap and was admitted to the floor.
On the morning of [**2176-1-5**] he remarked on shortness of breath to
the nursing staff. He was in the process of receiving a
nebulizer when his eyes rolled back in his head and he became
pulseless. A code blue was called. His code status was in
question, as an admission note documented "reportedly DNR/DNI"
but this was not confrimed with the attending and not ordered in
POE. The attending was contact[**Name (NI) **] and did know the patient's code
status. Family members were [**Name2 (NI) 16535**] at the time of the code.
He was initially in Asystole and CPR was begun. He was given
atropine/epi x 2 of both, and enered a wide complex, bradycardic
PEA. He was given bicarb/calcium chloride, and regained a pulse
and a blood pressure of 140/90. He was intubated during the code
and brought to the ICU.
Subsequently, documentation of a signed DNR/DNR from [**Month (only) 462**]
[**2174**] was found in his chart, signed by his brother and HCP,
[**Name (NI) **].

Relevant Imaging:
ECHO ([**1-4**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%) Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The aortic
valve is not well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

CTA ([**1-5**]): 1. No pulmonary embolus. 2. Large left pneumothorax
and subcutaneous emphysema in the left chest wall. 3. Bilateral
lower lobe consolidation and additional patchy areas of
consolidation throughout the remainder of the lungs, findings
that could represent aspiration, pulmonary hemorrhage,
superimposed pneumonia, or a combination of the above. 4.
Dilated esophagus containing fluid and gas could relate to
possible aspiration. 5. Multiple left sided rib fractures.

CT Head ([**1-5**]): 1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage. 2.
Age-related brain atrophy. 3. No significant interval change
since the prior study.

CTA Head ([**1-6**]): Mild brain atrophy on head CT without acute
hemorrhage or mass effect. Normal CT angiography of the head.

EEG ([**1-7**]): This is an abnormal portable EEG due to persisent
moderate
amplitude generalized spike and slow wave epileptiform
discharges, with
a bifrontocentral predominance, at times in prolonged runs at a
frequency of [**1-6**].5 Hz. Clinically, the patient was unresponsive
to
voice or tactile stimuli and was noted to have intermittent
jerking
movements of his legs. Findings are consistent with
non-convulsive
status epilepticus.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 85 yo male with history of afib, HTN, parkinson's disease
presents with new onset fluid overload, CP, and elevated BP, now
s/p asystolic cardiac arrest with unclear precipitant.

1) Cardiac arrest: The patient was admitted to the MICU
following his resusitation from cardiac arrest. At the time of
his code, his code status was uncertain. Ddx included
aspiration, acute arterial occlusion, hypoxia, acidemia,
electrolyte abnormalities, and pulmonary embolism. He was
intubated and then transferred to the MICU. He was placed on
broad spectrum antibiotics and also underwent several imaging
studies including echo, CTA chest, and CT head. Decision was
then made by health care proxy to change code status to [**Name (NI) 3225**].
Patient then passed away.

2) Respiratory failure: Given unclear code status, the patient
was intubated for airway protection during the cardiac arrest.
