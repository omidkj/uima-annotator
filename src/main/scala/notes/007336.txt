Pertinent Results:
[**2137-4-25**] Echo: Pre CPB: Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
the body of the left atrium and left atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated
with normal free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is
severely dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-27**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**1-27**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen with a dilated Tricuspid
annulus (surgeon informed). Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person
of the results. Post CPB: The patient was initially A-paced and
then SR, on a phenylephrine infusion. The biventricular systolic
function is preserved. LVEF 55% The left atrial appendage has
been resected. There is a tube graft in the ascending aorta
position. There is mild MR, mild TR, and mild AR.

[**2137-5-1**] CXR: Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are stable.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions larger on the left side,
unchanged from prior study allowing the difference in
positioning of the patient. Bilateral atelectasis, left greater
than right. There is no pneumothorax or pulmonary edema. Sternal
wires are aligned.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 11193**] was admitted same day surgery and was brought to the
operating room for ascending aortic replacement, MAZE, and left
atrial appendage ligation. Please see operative report for
further details. Postoperatively she was transferred to the
intensive care unit for management. She required vasodilators
for blood pressure management and was placed on amiodarone for
atrial fibrillation s/p MAZE. She remained intubated due to
oxygen requirements and over the next few days was diuresed and
able to be weaned from ventilation. She was able to be extubated
on post operative day three but continued to require aggressive
diuresis and pulmonary exercises. She was weaned down to nasal
cannula and was transferred to the floor on post operative day
five. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per
protocol. Additionally she was started on Coumadin for atrial
fibrillation but had rapid rise in INR and was treated with FFP.
INR trended back down after several days of no Coumadin. She
worked with physical therapy for strength and mobility. She
continued to make steady progress and on post-op day seven she
was discharged to rehab ([**Doctor First Name 533**] Centre) with the appropriate
medications and follow-up appointments.
