History of Present Illness:
88 yo male with a history of CHF (EF 40 to 45%)requiring
admission in [**4-26**], moderate MR, mild AR, severe PR, moderate to
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and lymphoma now
in remission was sent to the ED from clinic complaining of a one
day history of dyspnea on exertion and nausea. The patient was
confused at the time of admission so history was obtained from
his wife, sons and daughter. [**Name (NI) **] the family the patient
complained of general body aches, nausea without vomiting
shortness of breath at rest and fatigue beginning the morning of
admission.  They also note a 3 month history of progressive L
leg edema with a none healing ulcer. The family notes also he
had missed his evenining medications the night before admission
including his home lasix and lisinopril. He presented to his
PCPs office where he was sent to the ED for evaluation for ACS.
.
In the ED he had a elevated troponin, BNP.  EKG showed new ST
depressions.  It was felt the patient was likly having a CHF
exacerbation with plan to admit to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**].  However while in the
ED he had one episode of bradycardia to the 30s, hypotensive to
the 70s/30s systolic and unresponsive.  He was given atropine 1
mg with improvement in pressures to the 90-100s systolic,
increase in HR to the 70s and improvement in responsiveness.  EP
was consulted for possible temporary pacemaker placement, they
determined this was not needed given hemodynamic stability and
the patient was transferred to the CCU for close monitoring. On
admission the patient was denying chest pain and shortness of
breath but was very confused.  His family reports confusion has
been present since the bradycardic episode.
.
On review of systems, his family denies any prior history of
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, His
family denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.  All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
+ dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, + 3 pillow
orthopnea, + ankle edema, - palpitations, -syncope or
presyncope.

Imaging:
CXR PA and Lateral [**2147-7-25**]:
FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained
demonstrating
cardiomegaly without overt pulmonary edema. Mild pulmonary
vascular
congestion may be present though appears slightly improved from
the prior
exam. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Heart
size is
stably enlarged. Mediastinal contour is unchanged with an
unfolded thoracic aorta containing faint atherosclerotic
calcification. Bony structures appear intact.

[**2147-7-25**] LENIs:
IMPRESSION: No DVT in the bilateral lower extremities.

[**2147-7-25**] Bedside TTE during CPR:
Emergency study during a "code" while CPR is performed.
Several subcostal images taken during CPR and during pulse check
demonstrating cardiac stand-still. No cardiac function
appreciated despite resuscitation efforts.


Brief Hospital Course:
On admission pt was noted to be delirious but initially had HR
70s and BP 110s/70s. EKG showed rate in 70s with P waves before
most QRS complexes.  At 20:35 pt developed sudden onset of
bradycardia to the 50s and hypotension with BP 70s/40s. Atropine
was given without significant effect and patient??????s mental status
started to become more altered. Pt started to become very
lethargic and anesthesia was called. Patient had a pulse and bag
mask ventilation was initiated. After a few minutes pt became
completely non-responsive and was intubated by anesthesia.
Quickly after intubation patient became pulseless and PEA arrest
algorithm was initiated with chest compressions. Pt was given
multiple doses of epinephrine during code and bedside ECHO
showed no pericardial fluid but an akinetic myocardium. After
15min resuscitation was ended due to medical futility. He was
pronounced dead at approximately 21:15 on [**2147-7-25**].  Family was
called by the CCU team and informed of his passing. They
declined autopsy. Message was left with the covering service of
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (PCP and primary cardiologist) to inform him of the
passing.
