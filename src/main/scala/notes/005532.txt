Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15344**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
exploratory laporotomy, lysis of adheasions, small bowel
resection


History of Present Illness:
88F with h/o DM, CHF, afib, recent pneumonia (Zosyn) and C diff
(course of Flagyl), among other med issues, presents with one
day of abdominal pain. Pain began at epigastrium and migrated by
presentation to ED to hypogastrium, and finally localized to RLQ
at time of admission. No N/V/BRBPR. Diarrhea per recent c diff,
but normal BM yesterday was her last BM. Dark stools secondary
to iron supplementation, but guiaic neg in ED. Pt denies nausea
per se, but had one episode of emesis yesterday brought on by
coughing spell.
   Additional issues for this admission developed as patient was
in rapid afib in ED, tachypneic, and had B diffuse crackles on
lung exam. O2 sats stable on 100%, but patients normal
requirement is only 2L. CPAP was attempted in ED, but patient
refused and became agitated. After multiple doses of Diltiazem
IV brought pulse rate to 90's, O2 was pulled back to 4L and O2
sat was 98%.
   Patient has had multiple admissions recently for pulmonary
edema, at [**Hospital1 112**] and [**Hospital1 18**], treated effectively with diuresis and
diltiazem drip when patient in rapid afib.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted for obervation and control of her rapid a-fib.
It was hoped that controling the a-fib would help resolve her
CHF.  She was started on a diltiazem drip and on HD 1 her HR
began to normalize.  On HD 2 pt's abdominal pain worsened and
she was taken to the OR where she was found to have a possible
right ovarian mass and necrotic small bowel.  She underwent an
exploratory laporotomy, lysis of adheasions, repair of
enterotomy, resection of small bowel, and right oopherectomy.

Postoperatively she was noted to have a significantly decreased
urine output, and a nephrology consult was obtained.  By HD3
(POD1) the pt's creatinine had increased to 3.1 from 2.1.
Nephrology confirmed the diagnosis of post IV-contrast
nephropathy.  Pt was monitored in the SICU for the following 4
days to monitor closely her volume and renal status.  It was
during this time that she developed one episode of hemoptosis
after her swan was wedged.  The swan was removed and a CT
surgery consult was obtained when a chest x-ray was read as
having a possibly widened mediastienem.  CT showed no
abnormality and CT surgery signed off.  Mrs.[**Known lastname 109877**] urine
output was at this time minimally responsive to lasix, and her
creatinine ultimately peaked at a value of 4.1.  Mrs. [**Known lastname **]
slowly improved and was moved to the floor.  Her creatinine
slowly dropped to a new baseline of 2.2.

On POD 11 she developed diarrhea and the suspicion of repeat
c.diff enterocolitis was confirmed.  Pt was started on flagyl,
but her white counts remained persistently elevated and a UTI of
a poly resistant klebsiella grew.  ID was consulted and an
antibiotic regimen of vanco PO and ceftriaxone IV was initiated.


On several occations, pt's PO2 dropped from the mid 90s to the
high 80s, and her O2 requirement grew.  These episodes occured
on several nights, but seemed to be related to aspiration of
thin liquids at night.  A swallow study during the day
demonstrated no impairment, but aspiration precautions were
initiated, especially at night.

Pt's WBC continued to increase and Heme-Onc was consulted to
rule out transformation of her [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] to lukemia.  They
confirmed that the WBCs were all mature forms, and a combination
of hydroyurea and epo was started to help resolve the pt's
anemia and high WBC count.  The pt's wbc peaked at 57'000.  It
then has declined to a value of 12'200 on [**9-1**].  Heme-onc has
reccommended that we continue the hydroxyurea and epo and follow
cbcs with diff every four days or so.

Pt ultimately was dced to rehab after her coumadin was
theraputic (INR=2.9), her SaO2 was stable, her diarrhea is
tapering, her CHF is much improved (now minimal crackles in b/l
bases, her UTI is being adequately treated, her anemia is
resolving (hct 33.9), her WBC count is normalizing (last 12.2),
her heart rate is controled (80s and 90s), and her creatinine is
much improved (now 2.2).  She still needs to improve her caloric
intake and begin physical rehab.
