History of Present Illness:
53yoF with h/o DM2, Etoh abuse who presented to an OSH with
confusion and urinary/fecal incontinence after approximately two
to three months of non-specific symptoms, most noticeably

leukopheresed and started on hydroxyurea.
Of note, pt had recent a recent work-up in [**Month (only) **]/[**Month (only) **] for
weightloss (~30lbs over past year) which included labs notable
only for anemia and CT Abd which per husband "showed
pancreatitis."

Type two diabetes
Alcohol abuse

Pt lives with her husband outside of [**Name (NI) 86**] and has two
children.  She works for a medical billing company.  She has a

prior to admission.  Smoking history includes a thirty pack year
history.

Brief Hospital Course:

1. Respiratory failure -- Initially intubated at an OSH, Mrs.
[**Known lastname 59246**] proved difficult to extubate because of poor oxygenation
related to large bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrates.  Given
her low EF, this was first felt to be related to pulmonary
edema, however, when these continue to worsen despite adequate
diuresis, an infectious source became the prime suspect.
Because of her history of cough/myalgias, she underwent nasal
washings for the flu and was put on droplet precautions; the DFA
came back positive, and per ID's reccomendations, oseltamivir
was begun.  Given her functionally neutropenic state, cefepime
and vancomycin also were initiated for a possible bacterial
process, with azithromycin added later for atypicals.  She
spiked a temperature to 104 the first night, but all cultures
failed to grow.  Although afebrile following this, her
temperature curve could not be interpreted due to steroids given
in stress-dosing.
On this antimicrobial regimen along with diuresis, her sats
intially improved, and she was able to be extubated.  However,
the following day her steroids were stopped and she became
increasingly tachypneic and re-spiked a temperature.  Her chest
x-ray showed progression of the infiltrate and she wae
re-intubated, primarily for bronchoscopy.  She was unable to be
weaned off the ventilator, and eventually developed pulmonary
changes consistent with end-stage ARDS/fibrosis.  She was
started on steroids, and remained intubated.  After 2 weeks on
steroids repeat CXR should slight improvement of diffuse
infiltrates.  Her ventilatory settings were gradually weaned and
she was able to tolerate PS with minimal pressures and PEEP.
She was tolerating PS for 24 hour periods at a time.
Unfortunatley she had an event of hemoptysis in which she
desaturated into the 70's and required increase vent support.
Two felx bronchs were done which could not identify a focal
source for the bleeding.  She only lost a small amount of blood
and ultimately it was felt to be caused by aggressive
suctioning.  After this event she had no further hemoptysis
however she required AC on the vent.  Attempts were made to try
PS but the patient only lasted 15 minutes or so before tired.
Also around this time she developed fevers and bacteremia.  It
was then decided to hold off any attempts at weaning and keep
the patient on full vent support until she cleared the
infections and was afebrile.  CXR during this period showed
persistent signs of ARDS with no improvement in lungs on CXR.

The patient had increasing respiratory distress from [**2183-2-8**]
onward and became increasingly difficult to ventilate with
worseining CXR on full coverage of antimicrobial agents. In
addition, she required three pressors support over the period
from [**Date range (1) 8361**]. The decision was made by the family to withdraw
pressors on [**1-15**]. She died within hours.

2. Blast crisis -- Most likely AML.  She was intially
leukopheresed, bringing her WBC down from 60,000 to 30,000 and
was started on hydroxyurea and allopurinol.  DIC and tumor lysis
labs were followed every six hours but remained negative.  More
definitive chemotherapy was initially put on hold given her poor
respiratory function/infection (as described below) and her
initial echo with and EF of 30%.  Her counts continued to drop
while on hydrea, until eventually it was discontinued.  She was
transfused multiple times to keep her Plt > 10 and Hct > 20,
eventually having a minimal response to transfusions.  DAT was
positive for anti-SDH, which according to the blood bank, was
not enough to account for what would have been the degree of
hemolysis needed for the lack of response. Oncology determined
that the patient was too ill to begin chemotherapy; her WBC
eventually decreased to consistently below 1000 total.  She
remained neutropenic for 2-3 weeks then as she improved her WBC
began to slowly rise again.  She had a period where she was
non-neutropenic for about 7 days during whichc she was afebrile
and off of antibiotics.  Also noted during this period was that
she had no blasts in her peripheral blood samples.  Thus it was
decided to re check a bone marrow biopsy to determine if the
patient had AML or more of a MDS picture.  Bone marrow biopsy
demonstrated 20% blasts indicative of AML.  After being
non-neutropenic for 7 days or so her counts began to drop at
which point it was discovered she had VRE and MRSA bactermia.
Also she now had blasts back in her peripheral blood.  At this
point from heme/onc position the patient would require induction
chemotherapy to induce remission and then the only curative
measure would be BMT.  However given the patients condition this
was not an option as she would not survive chemotherapy given
her state of health.  Discussion was held with the family and
goal was for patient to go to rehab with possibilities of
regaining her strength their and maybe at some point down the
line she may be strong enough to go through chemo.

3. Anisochoria -- Noted on the first morning of admission, the
patient's anisochoria manifested as a dilated right pupil that
was sluggishly reactive as compared to a smaller, reactive left
pupil.  This finding was [**Location (un) **] out in both bright and dim light
and was clearly different from her admission physical exam.  A
stat head CT was obtained without obvious abnormalities and
neurology was consulted.  An MRI additionally failed to provide
and explanation, and ultimately, it was felt that this was due
to the disease process, possibly a leukemic infiltrate. She was
given intrathecal methotrexate empirically, followed by
intrathecal cytarabine.  On CT she was also noted to have
splenic infarcts; however, her other respiratory and infectious
problems prevented any further workup for possible infiltrative
disease.

4. Elevated LFTs -- Present upon admission, the top
