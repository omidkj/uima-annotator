History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 32-yo woman with h/o IVDA recently started on Methadone,
who is admitted after being found unresponsive. The pt was found
unresponsive of unknown duration at her group home, lying supine
in bed. She had reportedly last been seen normal at ~1500 this
afternoon, approx 1-2 hours prior to being found unresponsive.
Reportedly, she had started on methadone on Monday, with an
increase in her dose from 45mg to 50mg yesterday. She also had
been vomiting for the past few days. She was initiated on
ventilation by BLS until EMS arrived. She was noted by EMS to
have pinpoint pupils, so she received Narcan 2mg IM + 2mg IV,
without significant effect except for a slight increase in
pupillary diameter. She was then intubated by rapid sequence
intubation and transported to [**Hospital3 20284**] Center.
.
At [**Hospital3 20284**] Center, she was noted to be pale, cool, and
dry, smelling of foul urine, with coffee-grounds from her NGT
and thick brown secretions from her ETT. GCS was 3 and she was
thought to have decorticate posturing and possibly intermittent
seizing, without change to Ativan 2mg IV x2 and Fosphenytoin.
Head CT showed diffuse cerebral edema with loss of white-[**Doctor Last Name 352**]
matter c/w anoxic brain injury, so she received Decadron 10mg IV
x1. ABG was 7.28/48.4/361.9, and CXR showed bilateral lower lobe
atelectasis and mild pulmonary vascular congestion. WBC was
elevated at 33.9 as well, so she received Levofloxacin 750mg IV
x1 and was ordered for Vancomycin 1gram IV x1. She also received
Protonix 40mg IV x1 and a 500cc NS IVF bolus. Urine tox was only
positive for methadone. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for
further evaluation.
.
In the ED, VS - BP 123/82, HR 76, R 18, SaO2 100% RA. She
remained intubated but was awake, moving her eyes and arms
purposefully, so she was sedated with midazolam and fentanyl
gtts. ECG and CXR were unremarkable, and NCHCT showed no ICH or
infarct. She is being admitted to the MICU for further care.
.
On arrival to the MICU, she was noted to desaturate while being
suctioned...

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT / PLAN: 32-yo woman with h/o IVDA recently started on
Methadone, found unresponsive at her group home and intubated,
also thought to have anoxic brain injury with decorticate
posturing and/or seizures, elevated WBC, coffee-ground emesis,
and thick secretions.
.
#. Unresponsiveness: Pt found unresponsive at home, thought to
be due to overdose, possibly combination of increased dose of
methadone with other ingestions although history very unclear.
Did not respond initially to Narcan, and neuro exams previously
concerning per OSH records, including decorticate posturing,
question of intermittent seizures, and reportedly Head CT c/w
anoxic brain injury. At [**Hospital1 18**] extubation patient is responsive
and purposeful without sedation. Repeat NCHCT here without
concerning findings. Tox screen positive only for methadone. No
concerning deficits on neurologic exam. Psych evaluated patient
and felt there was no concern for suicide attempt.
.
#. Coffee-ground emesis: Reported at OSH. Likely secondary to
injury to lateral tongue during intubation. HCT remained stable
during hospitalization and no further coffee-ground emesis was
identified.
.
#. Leukocytosis: Thought to be secondary to acute stress
response. Initially started on Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and
Flagyl. These were discontinued when transfered to general
medicine floor. Patient remained afebrile and leukocytosis
trended down.
.
#. Transaminitis: Very mild transaminitis during
hospitalization. Unclear if this is secondary to recent acute
illness, med effect, or more chronic process such as a viral
hepatitis. Transaminases trending down prior to discharge. These
will need to be followed as an outpatient after discharge.
Further, testing for hepatitis should be performed. Asymptomatic
at time of discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 85002**],

It was a pleasure caring for you while you were admitted with
unresponsiveness. You were initially intubated to support your
breathing. It is unclear what led to this episode of
unresponsiveness. It may have been secondary to your recent
increase in Methadone dosing. We will contact your methadone
clinic regarding a lower methadone dose.
.
Please contact your primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 8516**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 85003**]
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 85004**]) regarding a follow up appointment in the next
two weeks. Further, return to your methadone clinic on Monday
for continued care.
.
No changes were made to your medications regimen. Your Methadone
clnic should decrease your methadone dose, given concern that
this may have contributed to your medication regimen.
.
Again, it was a pleasure participating in your care.

Followup Instructions:
Please contact your primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 8516**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 85003**]
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 85004**]) regarding a follow up appointment in the next
