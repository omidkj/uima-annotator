Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 88392**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service on
[**2142-8-20**] and taken to the Operating Room for L3-S1 interbody
fusion through an anterior approach. Please refer to the
dictated operative note for further details. The surgery was
without complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU
in a stable condition. TEDs/pnemoboots were used for
postoperative DVT prophylaxis. Intravenous antibiotics were
given per standard protocol. Initial postop pain was controlled
with a PCA. On HD#2 she returned to the operating room for a
scheduled T12-L3 decompression with PSIF as part of a staged
2-part procedure. Please refer to the dictated operative note
for further details. The second surgery was also without
complication and the patient was transferred to the PACU in a
stable condition. Postoperative HCT was stable. On HD#3 she
returned for a scheduled T10-S1 posterior fusion with
instrumentation.  A bupivicaine epidural pain catheter placed at
the time of the posterior surgery remained in place until postop
day one.
She developed a post-operative ileus and an NG tube was placed.
The ileuse was slowly resolving and NG tube was removed with
diet advanced.
She developed acute distension and was transferred to the TICU
for monitoring. There, an NG tube was placed and her abdomen was
decompressed.  CT scan showed no sign of blockage.
She was subsequently transferred out of the TICU and monitored.
She was kept NPO until bowel function returned then diet was
advanced as tolerated. The patient was transitioned to oral pain
medication when tolerating PO diet. Foley remained in place due
to post-op urinary incontenance.  This will be managed by her
PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was fitted with a TLSO brace for ambulation. Physical
therapy was consulted for mobilization OOB to ambulate. Hospital
course was otherwise unremarkable. On the day of discharge the
patient was afebrile with stable vital signs, comfortable on
oral pain control and tolerating a regular diet.
