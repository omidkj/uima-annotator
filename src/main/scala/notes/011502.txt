Admission Date:  [**2163-3-7**]     Discharge Date:  [**2163-3-23**]

Date of Birth:   [**2108-5-28**]     Sex:  M

Service:  MICU/[**Doctor Last Name **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 54-year-old gentleman
with a history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary
embolism in [**2155**], history of hypertension, and atrial
fibrillation who presented to the Emergency Department with
extreme dyspnea on exertion and weakness.

He had been recently hospitalized on [**2-23**] to [**3-2**]
for bleeding complications secondary to his liver biopsy.  As
well, he was hospitalized on [**2-4**] to [**2-7**] for
dyspnea and recurrent deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary
embolism.

The first admission in [**2163-1-25**] was notable for a
diagnosis of multiple pulmonary emboli diagnosed by computed
tomography angiogram.  An hypercoagulable workup was done,
and anticoagulation with a heparin drip and warfarin were
started. His dyspnea improved, and he was discharged to home.
An incidental finding on computed tomography scan was found
(i.e., a hepatic nodule) during this hospitalization, and
further imaging was worrisome for a malignant lesion, and a
biopsy was arranged.  His anticoagulation was held for his
biopsy on [**2-22**].  He suffered a hematocrit drop from 38
to 28, and a hepatic subcapsular hematoma after this biopsy
and presented again to the hospital on [**2-23**] with right
scapular and shoulder pain.

On [**2-25**], he underwent an hepatic artery branch
embolization.  An inferior vena cava was not placed at that
time.  His anticoagulation was restarted on [**2163-2-27**],
and he was subsequently discharged to home on [**3-2**] with
enoxaparin and warfarin.

According to the patient's wife, at the time of the current
admission, Mr. [**Known lastname **] began to feel very fatigued within one
to two days after his discharge.  Three to four prior to
admission, his dyspnea worsened with not being able to climb
one flight of steps on the morning of admission.  He could
not even walk six feet without feeling extremely short of
breath and fatigued.

He denied any chest pain, palpitations, fevers, chills,
headache, twitching, or paresthesias.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was obtunded and
diaphoretic with an oxygen saturation of 90% and had a
systolic blood pressure in the 70s (requiring pressor
initiation).  He then became bradycardic with his heart rate
in the 40s and thready peripheral pulses with increased
hypoxia.  He became nonresponsive.  He was intubated on the
second attempt.  He never lost a pulse.  His systolic blood
pressures remained in the 70s.  His oxygen saturation was
very difficult to follow.  Atropine and epinephrine were
administered with improvement in his heart rate and his
systolic blood pressure to the 80s by Doppler.

A bedside echocardiogram showed very depressed left
ventricular function with no blood in the pericardium.  A
triple lumen catheter in the right femoral vein was placed
urgently, and a dopamine drip was continued, and the patient
was transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed temperature was 95, heart rate was 116 and irregular
(on pressors as mentioned), blood pressure was 100/50, and
oxygen saturation was in the 80s on synchronized intermittent
mandatory ventilation of 700 X 16 with 100 FIO2.  His weight
was 116 kilograms.  In general, he was intubated and sedated
with occasional twitching in the left lower extremity.  His
sclerae were anicteric.  There were no conjunctival
hemorrhages.  No jugular venous distention was appreciated in
this obese gentleman with a thick neck.  The lung sounds were
coarse bilaterally without wheezing or crackles.  Heart
examination revealed tachycardic.  The abdomen was obese with
decreased bowel sounds.  There were no ecchymoses over his
abdomen or groin.  Extremities were cool and clammy.  There
were no petechia or ecchymoses noted.  Neurologic examination
was limited secondary to sedation.  His toes were upgoing
bilaterally, on sedation.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission were notable for a white blood cell count of 8,000,
hematocrit was 35.7, and platelets were 185.  His INR was 1.6
and partial thromboplastin time was 25, and prothrombin time
was 15.3.  Creatinine was 1.5.  Troponin was less than 0.3.
Liver function tests were normal.  There was no prothrombin
mutation noted on previous testing.  Homocystine was 13.7.
Arterial blood gas in the Emergency Department was 7.24/49/62
while intubated on the FIO2 of 100%.  His lactate was 3.9.
Anticardiolipin immunoglobulin M was 27 and immunoglobulin G
was 6.5.  Factor V level 105.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed
sinus tachycardia with a rate of 120.  Intervals were
otherwise normal.  He had poor R wave progression.  No ST
changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   The patient was brought to
the cardiac catheterization laboratory and a right heart
catheterization revealed a pulmonary artery pressure of
49/17, right ventricular pressure was 49/15, and a wedge
pressure was 28, with minimal flow of the left lower lobe of
his lung, and some filling to the left upper lobe.

Coronary angiography revealed no significant disease of a
left-dominant system.  He had mild left main disease with a
50% left anterior descending artery lesion and minimal
luminal irregularities.

Because of the patient's previous history of pulmonary emboli
in the past, a surgical embolectomy was not a favorable
option.  Percutaneous embolectomy also seemed not feasible
technically.  After considerable debate, thrombolysis was
started with alteplase on the day of admission 100 mg
intravenously dosed over two hours.  He was subsequently
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit with a right
femoral triple lumen catheter and a right femoral artery
sheath in place.

The remainder of his hospital course will be dictated by
problem/issues.

1.  PULMONARY EMBOLISM ISSUES:  The patient's oxygen
saturation rose dramatically within the first hour of
thrombolytic therapy.  He was subsequently extubated on
hospital day two.  An inferior vena cava filter was placed on
[**3-8**] through the previous venous access obtained on
the day of admission.

The patient's goal INR was 3 to 3.5.  The patient remained on
a heparin drip until his INR was therapeutic.

2.  ATRIAL FIBRILLATION/ATRIAL FLUTTER ISSUES:  During his
hospitalization, the patient was in atrial flutter and
continued to have shortness of breath and signs of congestive
heart failure which were difficult to differentiate from his
known right heart failure in the setting of previous
pulmonary emboli.

He subsequently underwent cardioversion on [**3-17**] which
was successful in converting the patient to a normal sinus
rhythm.

3.  RENAL INSUFFICIENCY ISSUES:  The patient had renal
insufficiency during his hospital stay which continued to
improve with renal dosing of medications.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  (Discharge diagnoses included)
1.  Pulmonary embolism; presenting as cardiogenic shock.
2.  Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter.
3.  Renal insufficiency.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  (Discharge medications included)
1.  Amiodarone 600 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Isosorbide dinitrate 20 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4.  Hydralazine 50 mg p.o. q.i.d.
5.  Coumadin 7.5 mg p.o. q.d. (for a goal INR at the time of
discharge of 3 to 3.5).

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  Follow-up appointments were made for the patient to see
his primary care physician (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8166**] as well as his
cardiologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
2.  He was to follow up in the [**Hospital3 **] as well
for continued INR monitoring.
