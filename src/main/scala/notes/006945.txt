CXR:
[**2180-6-8**]: Bilateral lower lobe opacities are unchanged since
[**2180-6-7**] and may reflect bibasilar atelectasis or pneumonic
consolidation. Bilateral upper lungs are clear. No effusion or
pneumothorax. Coonduit not distended.
IMPRESSION: Persisting bibasilar lung opacities probably
atelectases or
pneumonic consolidation and unchanged since [**2180-5-16**].

Esophagus: [**2180-6-5**]:  Bibasilar patchy densities are most
consistent with atelectasis.
Thin barium was administered orally under fluoroscopic
visualization. Spot
fluoroscopic images were obtained in the AP, left and right
oblique views.  The patient is status post Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **]
esophagectomy. At the anastomosis, there is a mild dilation at
the presumed distal esophagus. Initially, curvilinear areas of
barium were seen projecting from the site of the anastomosis;
however, delayed images and further spot fluoroscopic images
with barium administration demonstrated that this appearance is
likely due to folds within the gastric pull-up. Contrast flowed
freely from the esophagus into the stomach.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of leak status post Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **]
esophagectomy.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 90008**] was admitted [**2180-5-29**] following minimally-invasive
esophagectomy surgery (thoracoscopic laparoscopic Ivor-[**Doctor Last Name **]),
laparoscopic jejunostomy tube, pericardial fat pad buttress. He
was extubated in the operating room, and transferred to the ICU
with right chest tube, JP, NGT, Foley and Epidural for pain. He
transferred to the floor POD 2.

Respiratory: aggressive pulmonary toilet, nebs, incentive
spirometer he initially titrated off oxygen until [**2180-6-4**]
developed rhonchi, productive cough and 2 L of oxygen.

ID: Nasal swab positive MRSA. Leukocytosis [**2180-6-5**] of 20. In
setting of elevated WBC, and productive cough, no fevers, he was
started on Vancomycin.  Cultures were sent sputum GPC pairs &
chains.  Chest tube site culture grew MRSA likely colonized.
Over the course of a few days his leukocyotosis improved,
productive cough improved and he was transition to Bactrim DS x
7 days.

Drains: right chest-tube and JP with minimal drainage was
removed

Card: Sinus tachycardia 110's- IV Lopressor titrated to HR < 90
converted to PO once diet initiated.  BP stable 110-130's.  On
discharge his heart rate was sinus rhythm 70's

GI: PPI, bowel regime continued. Pt had bowel movements
following surgery.  NGT was removed POD 4.

Nutrition: Replete was started POD 1 titrated to Goal 75 ml x 18
hours as recommended by the dietician. On [**2180-6-5**] he was
started on a full liquid diet following a negative barium
swallow which he tolerated.

Renal: He had normal renal function. Electrolytes were replete
as needed.  Daily weights were stable. The Foley was removed
with good urine output.  Volume overload noted [**2180-6-8**], gently
diuresed.

Pain: Epidural dislodged x 3 requiring replacement x 2 was
split, on POD2 with PCA Dilaudid and removed  He transition to
PO Roxicet via J-tube with good control.

Disposition: He was seen by physical therapy.  He was discharged
to The Palm [**Hospital 731**] Nursing Home in [**Location (un) 15749**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 90009**] on
[**2180-6-9**].  He will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as an outpatient.
