HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 33 year-old woman with
a history of HIV times two years with the most recent CD4 of
468 and [**3-20**] who is without complications, asthma, with a
history of endotracheal intubation who was reportedly ill
coughing for approximately three weeks prior to admission
when she took heroine and cocaine the night prior to
presentation.  She was found unconscious and unresponsive on
the day of admission with some response to Narcan
administered by EMS.  In the Emergency Room she had initial
O2 saturations at 70% on room air, which improved to 92%
nonrebreather.  She also received nebulizers, Prednisone,
Levofloxacin, Clindamycin and Bactrim.  Chest x-ray
demonstrated bibasilar ground glass opacities with
consolidation.  The CT scan showed bilateral alveolar
interstitial infiltrate.  The patient had no complaints of
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fevers or chills.  She did
complain of diffuse bone pain.  The patient was admitted to
the MICU due to ongoing oxygen requirements.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Asthma status post intubation in [**2092**].
2.  HIV diagnosed in [**2097**], last CD4 count 468 on [**3-20**].  No
reported complications.
3.  Ectopic pregnancy.
4.  Appendectomy.
5.  History of gonorrhea/chlamydia.
6.  History of depression.
7.  Reported history of tuberculosis, though negative PPD one
year ago.
8.  Leukopenia.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General, lethargic arousable woman,
vital signs temperature 98.1.  Blood pressure 98/62.  Pulse
98.  Respirations 21.  Sating 96% on 50% face mask.  HEENT
pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements intact.  No scleral icterus.  No cervical
lymphadenopathy.  Cor regular rate.  Normal S1 and S2.  Lungs
diffusely wheezy bilaterally.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
Warm and well perfuse.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 20.1, hematocrit 36.9,
platelets 271, sodium 135, potassium 3.5, chloride 99, bicarb
24, BUN 10, creatinine 1.2, glucose 226.  Tox screen positive
for serum benzos.  Arterial blood gas 7.26/54/104.
Electrocardiogram sinus tachycardia rate at 133.  Chest x-ray
bilateral ground glass opacities with confluent consolidation
posteriorly, could be secondary to hypersensitivity reaction,
sarcoid, ARDS, SARS if clinically indicated.  CT bilateral
alveolar interstitial infiltrate.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Hypoxia:  This was felt to be secondary
to an aspiration process complicated by aspiration
bronchospasm and capillary leak syndrome.  Her CD4 count is
greater then 200 and no history of prior dyspnea, argued
against PCP, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1064**].  The patient was treated in the MICU
with Clindamycin and Levofloxacin for aspiration.  Over the
next day the patient did well with diminished O2
requirements and remarkably improved chest x-ray.  Dispute of
recovery on plain films suggested that this was an aspiration
pneumonitis rather then an aspiration [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1064**].  The patient
remained afebrile and had an improved leukocytosis.

2.  Status asthmaticus:  The patient was treated with
nebulizers and steroids, also with rapid improvement.

3.  Cardiac:  Given the patient's tachycardia on admission
and a history of cocaine and heroine use the patient's
cardiac enzymes were cycled and were negative.

4.  HIV:  The patient was continued on her outpatient HIV
regimen while in house.  The patient disclosed that her HIV
status was unknown to her husband and son.  Social work
consult was obtained who met at lengths with the patient.
The patient states that she will disclose her HIV status to
her family on an upcoming vacation.


DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status asthmaticus.
2.  Aspiration pneumonitis.
3.  Cocaine and heroine overdose.
4.  HIV.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  The patient is to resume her home
medications as she left the hospital before receiving her
prescriptions.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  Will attempt to contact the patient to have
her follow up with her primary care physician and infectious
disease physician.
