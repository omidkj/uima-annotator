Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of [**First Name3 (LF) **]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Identifer: Dr. [**Known lastname 4901**] is an 82 y/oM with a h/o CAD s/p NSTEMI,
advanced Parkinson's Disease, recently diagnosed moderate-poorly
differentiated adenocarcinoma of the liver (cholangio vs. met of
unknown primary) with lymphatic invasion, history of recent
hematuria, and history of prior UTIs with ESBL producing
organisms.



He presents to the [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital1 5595**] with shortness of [**Hospital1 1440**],
found at [**Hospital1 5595**] to have RLL pneumonia. He has had several days of
profound fatigue. He states that he regularly has some chest
pain, both on exertion and at rest, typically once a day,
including the morning of admission, though he does not think
this has changed recently. He does have some worsening shortness
of [**Hospital1 1440**], and some cough.



He developed leukocytosis on [**2182-4-30**] from 7.1 -> 12.7 with 91%
PMN no bands. He had a U/A (unknown date) obtained that grew
Klebsiella, and he was restarted on ertapenem. He had a cxr on
[**2182-4-30**] that showed suspected RLL pneumonia, and he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.



In the ED, he was  99.6 107 177/95 32 96 at triage. CXR showed
suspected multifocal pneumonia, and he received vancomycin 1gm,
levofloxacin 750mg, and ceftriaxone 1gm all IV x1. Influenza
Viral DFA was sent and is pending. His peak temperature was 104
rectally in the ED, and he was found to be guaiac positive.



ECG showed appreciable inferolateral ST depressions, and a
troponin was checked and was elevated at 2.18. Cards was
consulted, but given his overal condition felt he was not a
candidate for early revascularization and recommended heparin
gtt.



He was also on labs found to he hyperkalemic, and received
bicarb, and kayexelate.

Final Report
CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2182-5-1**]

Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph from [**2182-3-15**].
Prior chest CT
from [**2178-10-30**] is also available for comparison.

CLINICAL HISTORY: 82-year-old man with shortness of [**Month/Day/Year 1440**].
Evaluate for
pneumonia or edema.

FINDINGS: Single portable AP chest radiograph is obtained.
Slight motion
blur limits evaluation. There are increased patchy opacities
involving both
lungs which is most compatible with multifocal pneumonia, though
mild
superimposed congestion cannot be excluded. There may be small
bilateral
pleural effusions. Heart size is at the upper limits of normal.
Mediastinal
contour is unremarkable. Atherosclerotic calcifications of the
aortic knob
are noted. There is no pneumothorax. Bony structures appear
grossly intact.

IMPRESSION: Findings most compatible with multifocal pneumonia
with possible
superimposed mild congestion, bilateral small pleural effusions.

<br>

[**5-5**] EKG - sinus, 1st degree block - noted ST/TW changes from
admission - without changes, mild prolonged Qtc
<br>

[**5-2**] Echo - EF noted 45-50%
<br>
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of
the inferior wall and hypokinesis of the inferior septum. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2181-2-1**],
the inferior septum appears mildly hypokinetic on the current
study and the inferior wall is frankly akinetic. Overall EF is
correspondingly lower.

Brief Hospital Course:
82M with metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown prior, CAD,
advanced Parkinson's Disease p/w PNA and UTI from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab -
found also to have positive biomarkers for NSTEMI (due to demand
stress) - admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] - cardiology notified - tx with hep
