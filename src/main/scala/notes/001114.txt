AICD firing

History of Present Illness:
58 yo man with CAD s/p IMI and subsequent systolic dysfuntion
(EF 25-30%), HTN, hyperchol, OSA, VT s/p ICD implantation
presents with AICD shocks. On Sunday, he had VT that was not
terminated by AVP and his ICD shocked him.  He sent tele to
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] which showed 12 VT episodes.  No intervention was
planned at that time.  Of note, he recently stopped his
carvedilol himself about 3 weeks ago because he thought is was
making him tired though he's been on this medication for a long
time.   He was recently admitted in [**Month (only) 547**] for elective VT
ablation.  He states that prior to [**Month (only) 547**] he his AVP sucessfully
terminted his VT and he had not had a shock in over a year.
More recently in the past 3 weeks, he's had a total of 4 shocks
(one Sunday, one at work today and 2 here in the ED). He's
unclear if this correlates with stopping his carvedilol.

Today, at work, he again went into VT and AVP was unsucessful at
converting and it shocked him.  He had no CP or SOB at the time.
 He called EMS and was brought here.

In ER, VS 98.0 86 156/95 18 100%RA. EKG with old RBBB otherwise
unremarkable for ischemia. He had another episode of VTach,
which the ICD attempted twice to ATP and then fired. EP was
consulted and witnessed a second failed ATP and AICD firing. He
was admitted to the CCU for further monitoring.

Currently, he feels well and has no complaints.  He states that
when he goes into VT he does not have chest pain or shortness of
breath - states that it feels like his heart is being 'tickled'.
 Denies blurred vision or lightheadedness during these episodes.
