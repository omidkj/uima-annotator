Fevers

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 38598**] is a 39 year old patient with NHL s/p alloSCT [**2155**] and
DLI [**2156**], in remission but with GVHD-associated bronchiolitis
obliterans and severe restrictive lung disease who was recently
admitted with fever, hypoxia and respiratory distress and
discharged to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2162-5-19**]. He is now being readmitted
from [**Hospital1 **] with low grade fevers for the past three days and
a fever today to 101.2 in the setting of missing IV Colistin.
.
The patient had a prolonged hospital admission last month for
pneumonia with multiple strains of highly resistant, elevated
LFTs, and Left brachial DVT (for which systemic anticoagulation
was not given for concern of recent GI bleed). His prednisone
was increased during this admission for concern of GVHD but then
subsequently tapered back to his prior dosage of 15mg QD. ID
started him on both inhaled and intravenous colistin in addition
to amikacin and he became afebrile with improved WBC count on
this regimen. He was supposed to continue this until [**5-26**].
He was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2162-5-19**]. Over the last
week at his rehab facility he was not continued on the IV
Colistin for unclear reasons. He did receive INH Colistin,
Amikacin, and Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole.
.
He was noted to develop daily low grade fevers starting [**5-22**] to
100.2. This morning his temp wa 101.2. Otherwise there were no
changes in his exam, no altered mental status, no increased
coughing or production in sputum, no diarrhea, no urinary
incontinence. Over the past week his BP has been 90s to low
100s, RR high 20s to low 30s, HR 95 - 117. The patient's family
reportedly were also not happy with his current care at rehab
and were wanting him to be admitted.
.
He went to his previously scheduled clinic visit, where he was
evaluated and it was decided he should be admitted for his
fevers.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he was hypertensive and had sinus
tachycardia to the 160s. He was agitated with copious
green/yellow secretions being suctioned out of his trach. He
denied shortness of breath or pain, but was requesting morphine
to releive his work of breathing.


Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History:
- [**4-/2154**] p/w fevers, night sweats, and weight loss in the
setting of a left inguinal lymph node.
- CT scan: 15x14x10cm mass in the LUQ.
- Bx grade II/III follicular lymphoma.
- Treated with six cycles of CHOP/Rituxan with good response,
but showed evidence for relapse in [**12/2154**] and was treated with
MINE chemotherapy for two cycles.
- [**3-/2155**]: Underwent stem cell mobilization with Cytoxan followed
by autologous stem cell transplant in
- [**7-/2155**]: Noted for disease recurrence. He was initially treated
with a course of Rituxan without response followed by Zevalin
with
- [**3-/2156**]: Noted progression of his disease. He was treated with

one cycle of [**Hospital1 **] followed by one cycle of ESHAP.
- [**2156-7-29**]: Nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant
with a [**5-30**] HLA-matched unrelated donor with Campath conditioning

- Six-month follow-up CT noted for disease progression.
- [**1-/2157**]: Received donor lymphocyte infusion in , complicated by
acute liver/GI GVHD grade IV, for which [**Known firstname **] required a
prolonged hospitalization in the summer of [**2156**].
- Multiple GI bleeds requiring ICU admissions and multiple
transfusions and embolization of his bleeding.
- Noted to have CNS lesions felt consistent with PTLD and this
was treated with a course of Rituxan. No evidence for recurrence
of the PTLD.
- Acute liver GVHD, on CellCept, prednisone, and photophoresis.

- [**2157-12-28**] Photophoresis was d/c'd due to episodes of
bacteremia and eventual removal of his apheresis catheter.
- [**2158-6-13**] restarted photopheresis on a weekly basis on , but
then discontinued this again on [**2158-9-7**] as this was felt not
to be making any impact on his liver function tests.
- undergone phlebotomy due to iron overload with corresponding
drop in his ferritin. He has continued with transient rises in
his transaminases and bilirubin and has remained on varying
doses of CellCept and prednisone which has been slowly tapered
over the time.
- [**2160-1-10**] CellCept discontinued.
- [**2159-1-19**] admission due to increasing right hip pain. MRI
revealed edema and infiltrating process in the psoas muscle
bilaterally. After extensive workup, this was felt related to an
infection and required several admissions with completion of
antibiotics in 03/[**2158**].
- [**7-/2160**]: Last scans showed no evidence for lymphom and he has
remained in remission.
- [**2160-10-20**]: URI and treatment with course of Levaquin.
- [**2160-11-13**] completed a 4 week course of Rituxan to treat his
GVHD.
-In [**5-/2161**], noted to have tiny echogenic nodule on abdominal
[**Year (4 digits) 950**]. MRI of the liver also showed this nodule but was not
as concerning on review and he is due to have a repeat MRI
imaging in early [**Month (only) **].
-- GI varices and attempts at banding have been unsuccessful due
to difficulty with passing the necessary instruments. He has
been on a low dose beta blocker as well as simvastatin, which
was started on [**2161-7-7**] to help with medical management of his
varices.
-On [**2161-8-3**], worsening cough and was noted to have a small
new pneumothorax in the left apical area. This has essentially
resolved over time
- Issues with weight loss (followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]);
multiple tests done with no etiology found; question
malabsorption related to GVHD
- Has on and off respiratory infections and has been treated
with antibiotics (now colistin inhaled and IV) for resistant
pseudomonas. Question underlying exacerbations of pulmonary GVHD
in setting of his URIs.
- Currently receives IVIG every month.
