History of Present Illness:
HPI: 84 yo M with hx of prior intraparenchymal hemorrhage,
presents now with new right temporo-occipital intraparenchymal
hemorrhage. Pt had been in NH at baseline health until Mon when
the daughter felt that he seemed a little "spaced out" at times
and not focusing. She also felt he was weak, in that he was
having trouble feeding himself, was dragging his feet when
walking, and was over stiff. She states a [**First Name3 (LF) 72787**] was done at that
time, which was supposedly normal, but she was later told a
bleed
was apprecaited and the pt was transferred here (it is acutally
unclear if he had more than one [**Name (NI) 72787**] since Mon). Despite these
complaints, during interview in the ER, the daughter felt that
her father was largely at his baseline mental status. She states
that is at baseline disoriented and has an aphasia.

Pertinent Results:
[**Doctor First Name 72787**] [**2143-10-24**]:
new right occiptal hemorrhage with no midline shift.
left frontal encephalomalcia

9/12Large area of intraparenchymal hematoma in the right
temporo-occipital region, unchanged measuring approximately 2.9
in the transverse dimension. Extension into the atrium and
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral ventricle with
nonvisualization of these portions of the right lateral
ventricle, unchanged. No significant change in the surrounding
the edema, or mass effect on the tentorium cerebelli. No new
hemorrhage or no mass effect.

[**10-28**] Slight decreased density of the large intraparenchymal
hematoma,
consistent with natural evolution of blood products. There is
otherwise no
significant interval change from prior study.



Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the neurosurgery service and monitored
closely in ICU.  he had repeat CT which was stable.  After
discussion with daughter - HCP - he was made DNR/DNI.  He was
transferred to neuro stepdown.   His blood pressure medications
have been adjusted to keep systolic <180.  This may need further
adjustment at rehab in combination with pt's long standing
cardiologist.
