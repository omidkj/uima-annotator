Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / lisinopril

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 89334**]
Chief Complaint:
Sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central line/a-line in ICU


History of Present Illness:
85 yo male with history of CAD s/p CABG, HTN, and diastolic
dysfunction, chronic dyspneic, found to have altered mental
status at rehab today.  In addition, he was noted to have fever,
respiratory distress, and hypotension.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 103 P 120 BP 88/43 R 29 (29-40)
with FSG: 192.  He was tachypneic with hypoxemia so he was
placed on a NRB.  He was not oriented in the ED and pulling at
lines.  He was altered so it was felt he would not tolerated
BiPap.  EKG, CXR, and UA were done.  Blood cultures were sent
prior to antibiotics.  Labs revealed elevated white count with
bandemia, and elevated creatinine at 2 from 0.7.  He was started
on vancomycin and cefepime for broad spectrum antibiotics for
presumed sepsis.  He was given 3-4L of IVF prior to R-IJ central
line placment.  He was started on peripheral levophed prior
without effect.  Central levophed was initiated and pressures
stablized for a half hour prior to transfer.  The patient was
confirmed DNR/DNI but okay for line placement and
hospitalization.  VS prior to transfer to the MICU were VS:
113/45, 109, 29, 100% 15L NRB.
.
On the floor, he was initially oriented x3.  He notes SOB but
couldn't find comfortable position, tired, constipation, pn,
uncomfortable. but denied CP, neck pain, headache, visual,
n/v/d, no leg pain, dysuria.

Imaging:
[**7-23**] RUQ U/S:  1. Increased liver echogenicity, compatible with
fatty infiltration. 2. Nondistended gallbladder with small
amount of intraluminal sludge, and marked gallbladder wall edema
measuring 7 mm. These findings are most compatible with low
protein state, third spacing due to liver disease or heart
failure. No definite evidence of acute cholecystitis. 3. Left
renal cyst.

air.
[**7-25**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Pulmonary congestion with left effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course
85 yo male with history of CAD s/p CABG, HTN, and diastolic
dysfunction presented with altered mental status, fever,
hypotension, and respiratory distress, found to have septic
shock with unclear etiology of infection (? biliary source)
.
# Septic shock: Patient presented with fevers, hypotension,
tachycardia with leukocytosis and bandemia.  Hypotension and
tachycardia refractory to IV fluids and peripheral pressors
requiring central pressor support.  Differential for source
included bacterial v. viral pneumonia, biliary source,
aspiration, meningitis, and prostatitis.  Possibilities
including biliary source that improved with supportive care vs.
bacterial pneumonia though initial cxr in ed was clear.  He was
stabilized in the ICU with IVF.  He required levophed and
vasopressin, which was weaned off after pressures had
stabilized.  He was treated with IV vancomycin and cefepime
started on [**7-22**].  His white count improved, he became afebrile,
and his blood cultures were negative, with the exception of an
isolated bottle positive for corynebacterium (a likely
contaminant).  Ended vanc/cefepime on [**7-31**] and remained afebrile
following this.
.
# Hypoxemia: Differential included infection, volume overload
from CHF, and PE but most likely was a result of pneumonia.  ABG
showed patient was ventilating well on 4L NC.  His hypoxemia
improved in the ICU with antibiotics, and at the time of
transfer he was satting 93 on RA.  weight 166.7 as of [**8-2**], down
from 180 in the ICU, no systolic CHF, but rather LVH and
resolving pulm edema and likely atelectasis.  no SOB, CP to
suggest PE. O2 sat on morning of discharge was 97% on room air.

#Gallstones and transaminitis:  LFTs improving following
admission to the ICU when they were ALT/AST in range 600-800 and
now 70, 40s as of [**2172-8-1**] and T bili normalized from [**4-28**] to
<1.0.  Alk phos remained slightly high in low 200s from peak in
300s.  Repeat ruq u/s showed distended gallbladder, gallstones,
but no ductal dilatation.  He also has fatty liver.  His
simvastatin was held in the setting of elevated LFTs but should
be re-started once LFTs have normalized.
--recommend repeat LFTs and outpatient repeat RUQ u/s and GI or
surgical evaluation for consideration of elective
cholecystectomy.

# ARF: Differential includes prerenal given insensible losses
from infection, poor perfusion from hypotension.  Obstruction
was ruled out clinically.  Most likely prerenal from infection,
and his creatinine improved with fluid rehydration.

# CAD s/p CABG:  Patient reports that his anginal equivalent is
chest pain with shortness of breath.  Patient remained chest
pain free.  Troponin mildly elevated on initial labs, but
without EKG changes.  His aspirin/plavix were continued and
simvastatin was held due to elevated LFTs--this can be
re-started once LFTs have normalized. aspirin dose decreased to
81mg from 325 given no recent stents.
.
# HTN: His metoprolol was held initially given hypotension but
then restarted.

# BPH: held detrol la i
