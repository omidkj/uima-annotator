Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension to 70s

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Tunnel catheter for HD
-Blood and FFP transfusions
-Hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
68 yo F with tracheobronchomalacia, on heparin gtt for AVR, who
was transferred here from an OSH for IP evaluation and possible
Y stent who is transferred to the MICU for hypotension. She was
initially admitted here on [**6-27**] and had a CT of her airway done
revealing tracheobronchomalacia. She was scheduled for the OR on
Monday for rigid bronch. Her bp remained stable on admission,
and was in the 130s-140s/70s-80s throughout the day on [**6-27**] and
[**6-28**]. On [**6-29**], her bp was 100/80 at 8 am (pulse 92 from 82),
92/43 at noon, and 87/54 at 4 pm (pulse 104). Per thoracic
surgery she was mentating throughout all of this. No UOP
recorded as she was incontinent, but at 8:45 pm a Foley was
placed and drained 250 cc urine. The MICU team was called at 9
pm for hypotension. [**Name8 (MD) **] RN notes her bp was 62/palp (75/p
w/doppler), pulse 120, respirations 32, and 98% on 3L. They
attempted to give a 500 cc bolus but her last peripheral IV
stopped working. She was transferred to the MICU at this time
for CVL placement and further monitoring. Of note, her INR was
subtherapeutic on admission at 1.4, and she was begun on a
heparin drip (due to AVR). Her PTT was greater than 150 since 6
pm last night, and despite adjustments in the heparin gtt it was
last measured at 147.5. Her heparin gtt was shut off at the time
of her MICU transfer.
.
Currently, she is awake but drowsy and is mentating
appropriately. She is complaining of severe abdominal and back
pain which she states has been going on since yesterday. She
also feels very cold.
.
In terms of recent history, she was admitted to [**Hospital 28448**] Center on [**6-17**] with SOB and cough. Initial CXR
was clear. They felt she had a COPD exacerbation and treated her
with steroids, bronchodilators, and azithromycin. On [**6-20**], she
became acutely SOB and CXR showed LUL infiltrate. She was begun
on zosyn and cipro for possible pseudomonal pna (as had
reportedly grown this in past). Swallow study was negative for
aspiration. On [**6-27**] (day of transfer) she was on day 7 of
cipro/zosyn. Per their notes her SOB and cough were much
improved. Her creatinine fluctuated between 1.8 and 2, and was 3
on discharge from the OSH. Her lasix and enalapril were
discontinued there, and she was begun on IVF (total 500 cc).
Renal ultrasound showed R kidney 10.2 cm w/mult cysts, left
normal, no hydro. She had a negative C diff there, blood cx
negative x2, urine cx negative. ABG 7.40/40/77 on [**6-21**].

CT Trachea [**2176-6-28**]
IMPRESSION:

1.  Severe diffuse tracheobronchomalacia.

2.  Cylindrical bronchiectasis, predominantly basal, and
scattered nodular
ground-glass opacities suggest chronic and ongoing aspiration.

3.  Small bilateral pleural effusion.

4.  Atherosclerosis, including coronaries.

5.  Moderate size hiatus hernia.
.
CT Abd/Pelvix [**2176-6-30**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  Large right pelvic side wall hematoma measuring 11.7 x 9.1
cm, with
extension into the right rectus muscle.  There is no evidence of

intraperitoneal extension of hemorrhage.  The possibility of
active
extravasation is not optimally assessed without intravenous
contrast.
2.  There are again seen scattered areas of ill-defined ground
glass opacity
and bronchiectatic changes within the lungs bilaterally, which
are not
significantly changed in comparison to most recent study from
two days prior.

.
Echo [**2176-7-2**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). Tissue
velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased
left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). A mid-cavitary gradient is
identified,
consistent with mild flow obstruction at rest. The patient was
unable to
cooperate with the Valsalva maneuver. Right ventricular chamber
size and free
wall motion are normal. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The
transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. No aortic
regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad, though a
loculated
anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.

IMPRESSION: Symmetric LVH with hyperdynamic systolic function,
and no regional
wall motion abnormalities. Mild resting mid-cavitary flow
obstruction.
Normally-functioning mechanical aortic valve prosthesis.
.
LENI [**2176-7-5**]
CONCLUSION:

No evidence of DVT.
.
CXR [**2176-7-4**]:
IMPRESSION:

1.  Newly inserted two right central lines with no evidence of
complications.

2.  Small new right pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo woman with tracheobronchomalacia, on heparin gtt for [**Hospital 64315**]
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from an OSH for IP evaluation and possible
Y stent who was transferred to the MICU for hypotension,
decreased Hct in the setting of retroperitoneal bleed.
.
1. Retroperitoneal Bleed - Pt had bleed and was hypovolemic in
setting of blood loss while supratherpeutic on heparin.  She
received aggressive fluid resuscitation and PRBC transfusions
while in house as needed for bleeding.  Her anticoagulation was
reversed with FFP.  She did not require pressors.  On CT scan,
she was found to have a large right pelvic side wall hematoma
with extension into the right rectus muscle.  There was no
evidence of intraperitoneal extension of hemorrhage.  We
monitored her Hct closely during the acute episodes q4.
Although her Hct stabilized, when we attempted to start
anticoagulation with warfarin again at low doses, she
subsequently developed a decreasing hematocrit which required
further transfusions of FFP and Hct.  While attempting slow
increase of coumadin to reach therapeutic INR for her AVR, she
began further dropping her HCT with increase of her INR to 1.8.
We reversed this INR with Vit K.  We decided that she was
currently not a candidate for anticoagulation in the setting of
her acute bleed and in the setting of increasing bleeds to even
