Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13561**]
Chief Complaint:
Vision loss

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
88 year-old right-handed man with a history of reported coronary
artery disease s/p CABG, dyslipidemia, and lymphoma, who
presents as a transfer from [**Hospital3 **] after presentation with
vision loss and falls.  The history is obtained from the
patient, who has some difficulty relaying the details, and
available
documentation.

The patient reports that he was in his usual health until ~3
weeks ago.  One day, while opening his eyes after showering, he
found that he could not see from his right eye. The patient
states that vision in his left eye was preserved.  He had
difficulty reaching for objects in the right side of his field
of vision.  The patient also states that he had several falls at
that time, which he also attributed to his visual loss.
However, over the following day, he reports that the vision in
his right eye improved.  It remained "blurred" and did not
entirely return to baseline.  He could see objects in front of
the eye and could reportedly discern color.  He reports that he
was assessed by his internist for these difficulties, and it was
presumed that he had a "stroke."  Interestingly, he states this
evening that he did not undergo imaging of his head at that time
and no further evaluation or management was pursued.

At the time of the event above, he had developed a building,
sharp, right-sided headache, located retro-orbitally and
involving the frontal and occipital regions.  It does not seem
to radiate elsewhere.  He states that he has had the pain daily
since that time, lasting for the majority of each day.  Though
he has had occasional associated nocturnal awakening, he denies
changes with position or Valsalva.  He states that he also has
associated neck discomfort, but denies a history of trauma or
manipulation.

According to available documentation, he was "last seen normal"
at ~9 pm on Wednesday evening.  However, he awoke on Thursday
morning at ~7 am and noted worsening "blurred" vision in his
right eye.  Though he usually walked with a walker, he was
having worsening trouble with ambulation; the patient states
tonight that he had fallen.  Family was apparently concerned
that he was confused and "usually sharper" than his current
state.  Blood pressure was 124/92, pulse 84.  His pupils were
"pinpoint."  He was brought [**Hospital6 302**].  [**Hospital3 **]
physicians were concerned by the presence of "medial rectus
weakness" on the right side.  There was no evidence of atrial
fibrillation on EKG. CXR showed no pneumonia.  A head CT, which
I reviewed here,
showed atrophy and a poorly defined low density region in the
left parieto-occipital region, ~2 cm in diameter.  There was no
hemorrhage.  He was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.

Review of Systems:
Has had diarrhea for the past 4 months.  Family has told him
that his speech is dysarthric, though he denies incomprehension.
 He denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, focal weakness,
numbness, tingling.

Past Medical History:
-CAD, s/p CABG, CHF, dyslipidemia, lymphoma, gout


Social History:
Lives with his daughters, reportedly uses a walker to ambulate.
He drinks a scotch nightly and quit use of tobacco 40 years ago.
 He denies drug use.


Family History:
Daughter with hypertension

Oriented to person, [**Location (un) 86**], [**2179-1-28**]
Attention: cannot perform days of week backward without errors
Language: fluent, perhaps mildly dysarthric speech, no

errors, naming, comprehension, repetition intact; [**Location (un) 1131**] intact
(uses left eye only)
Calculation: can determine 7 quarters in $1.75
Fund of knowledge: mentions recent election
Memory: registration: [**1-30**] items, recall 0/3 items at 3 minutes
No evidence of apraxia or neglect

Cranial Nerves:
Uncorrected acuity 20/70 on the left, 20/200 on the right.
Optic
discs could not be visualized due to miosis; visual fields are
difficult to perform by confrontation, perhaps reduced blink to
threat on the right.  Pupils 1.5 mm and unreactive bilaterally.
No ptosis.  His right eye does not adduct on leftward gaze, and
appears a bit abducted and depressed in primary position.
Facial
sensation intact bilaterally.  Face moves symmetrically, though
with left NLFF and flattening of left forehead creases.  Hearing
reduced to conversation. Palate elevates midline. Tongue
protrudes midline, no fasciculations.  Trapezii full strength
bilaterally.

Motor:
Appears diffusely wasted, with fasciculations in legs and in
left
hand noted.  Perhaps mildly increased tone in legs.  No pronator
drift.  Strength appears preserved throughout.

Sensation: Stocking distribution loss to pin prick, temperature
(cold).  Vibration absent at ankles.  Proprioception impaired to
smaller amplitudes in fingers and toes bilaterally.  No
extinction to DSS.

Reflexes: B T Br Pa Pl
Right     2 1 1  2  0
Left      2 1 1  2  0
Toes were mute bilaterally.

Coordination: Unable to perform FNF accurately due to his
diplopia and vision loss.  He initially misses on HKS
bilaterally, but corrects with repeat attempts on each side.

Gait:  Retropulses on standing, unable to proceed forward

Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro - Patient was admitted to the General Neurology service.
He was evaluated by ophthalmology who felt this was most
consistent with a partial CN III palsy secondary to ischemia or
inflammation.  Review of CT scan showed hypodensity in
periaqueductal area, hypodensity in L temporal area c/w old
infarct, and soft tissue mass around the foramen magnum.
Sedimentation rate and CRP were nl.  Electrolytes within normal
limits.

Initially did not tolerate MRI x2 attempts.  Required MRI with
anaesthesia to eval for ischemic process and to further evaluate
soft tissue mass around foramen magnum.  There was some concern
for lymphoma given h/o lymphoma to explain both soft tissue mass
and possible infiltrating process.

MRI/MRA brain, orbit and neck with and without contrast showed:
1. Enhancing soft tissue lesion at the skull base, surrounding
the dens, with
pre-contrast signal character
