RADIOLOGY

[**9-23**] TTE: EF 45%. septal & apical hypokinesis and possible
inferior hypokinesis. No AI/AS, 1+ MR, 2+ TR, moderate pulm
systolic HTN.  No vegetations.

[**9-23**] CT head: no acute stroke. chronic microvascular infarcts.

[**9-23**] CT chest: 1. New moderate to large bilateral pleural
effusions and marked progression of bilateral consolidation.
Dependent distribution suggests aspiration pneumonia.
2. Additional perihilar ground-glass opacity, in the setting of
bilateral pleural effusions, consistent with pulmonary edema or
ARDS.
3. Two round, hypodense lesions in the right kidney are too
small to accurately characterize but likely represent cysts.
4. Prominence of the left adrenal gland without focal mass
identified.
5. Prostate enlargement.

[**10-8**] CT A/P: 1. Interval improvement in bilateral perihilar
ground glass opacities suggestive of interval improvement in
pulmonary edema. There are persistent bilateral pleural
effusions, which have increased in size since the prior study
with bibasilar compressive atelectasis/consolidation.
2. Small pericardial effusion.
3. Small amount of ascites which has increased in the interval.
4. Stable appearance of fullness in the left adrenal gland
without a focal mass.
5. No focal fluid collections within the torso to suggest an
abscess.
6. Anasarca.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted on [**9-13**] with necrotic toes & cellulitis of his right
lower leg.  Given rising CK levels, an amputation was
unavoidable.  After appropriate cardiac clearance, he was taken
to OR for a right above-the-knee amputation on [**9-16**] (refer to
op note for specifics).  Was cleared for PO diet (thickened
liquids) by swallow team on [**9-17**], but developed acute
respiratory distress requiring intubation & transfer to ICU
setting on [**9-18**].  An organ system-based synopsis of his
prolonged ICU course is summarized below.

NEURO: He was sedated with propofol & ativan while intubated,
and was unresponsive until about 1 week prior to discharge.
Numerous Head CT's were negative.  At discharge, he responds to
voice and is able to move all extremities, but does not follow
commands.

CV: Because of his septic shock, he required significant pressor
to maintain an adequate blood pressure (MAP>60).  These were
weaned off as his sepsis improved.  He did develop cardiac
enzyme leak around the time of his respiratory failure, but an
echo did not show any significant loss of ventricular function.

RESP: [**9-18**] respiratory event attributed to aspiration
pneumonia, which worsened over next few days to fulminant ARDS &
septic shock.  Improved over weeks in ICU with broad spectrum
antibiotics (empiric for presumed infection), xigris (for
refractory septic shock) & ultimately steroids (for adrenal
insufficiency).
    He was intubated on [**9-18**], and remained intubated throughout
the remainder of his hospital stay.  He was changed to a
tracheostomy on [**10-7**], and gradually weaned down to pressure
support ventilation.  +pseudomonal PNA 3 days prior to
discharge, being treated with tobramycin & suctioning q1-2h prn.

FEN: Currently about 15kg above his baseline weight of 75kg.
Being diuresed with lasix IV drip about [**12-6**] kg/day.
Transitioned to PGT lasix prior to discharge & will continue
diuresis to his baseline weight.

GI: Perc GJ tube placed by Interventional Rediology [**10-12**] with
position confirmed with 11/10 KUB.  Respalor tube feeds via GT
at goal of 50cc/hr.  Last albumin 2.1.  Regular BMs with bowel
regimen of colace + prn laxatives.

HEME: Required multiple transfusions for anemia of chronic
disease (baseline hct 33).  Due to immobility, need to continue
with SC heparin (or lovenox) and L foot P boots to prevent DVTs.

ID: Never had positive cultures from suspected aspiration
pneumonia or for several weeks following respiratory event,
despite almost daily cultures & multiple CVL changes.  He was
treated for 3 weeks with broad spectrum antiobiotics (linezolid,
levaquin, meropenem, flagyl & fluc).  After stopping
antibiotics, his WBC & temperatures recurred & he develope
