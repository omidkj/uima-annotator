HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mrs. [**Known lastname 23598**] is an 86 year old
woman with a known history of aortic stenosis with a previous
hospital admission significant for congestive heart failure.
Recently, she became more symptomatic especially more short
of breath and more fatigued.  She had an echocardiogram on
[**11/2149**], which showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of
65%, aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 42, severe MAC,
one plus mitral regurgitation and trivial tricuspid
regurgitation.  She also had a Persantine MIBI in [**11/2149**],
which revealed mild ischemia of the apical segment of the
inferior wall and a mild fixed defect of the apical segment
of the anterior wall.  Her dyspnea significantly progressed
since then.

Most recently, an echocardiogram showed aortic gradient of
68, and left ventricular hypertrophy with good left
ventricular function.  The patient was consequently referred
for cardiac catheterization for further evaluation.

1.  Congestive heart failure.
2.  Aortic and mitral valve disease.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hyperlipidemia.
5.  Diabetes mellitus.
6.  Glaucoma.

8.  History of cerebrovascular disease with mild right sided
weakness.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Cholecystectomy.
2.  Partial hysterectomy.
3.  Status post left femoral-popliteal bypass graft.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:

LABORATORY STUDIES;  White blood cell count 7.4, hematocrit
11, platelets 240.  Sodium 132, potassium 4.8, BUN 26,
creatinine 0.8, glucose 113, magnesium 1.9.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given symptomatic disease, the
patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2150-11-2**].  The
findings were 30% distal stenosis of the LMCA, 60 to 70%
stenosis of the left anterior descending, mild disease of the
left circumflex and 95% stenosis of the right coronary
artery.

On [**2150-11-3**], the patient underwent aortic valve replacement
with 21 millimeter pericardial valve, C-E and coronary artery
bypass grafting times two, left internal mammary artery to
the left anterior descending, and saphenous vein graft to
patent ductus arteriosus.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no
complications.  Please see the full Operative Report for
details.

She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in stable
condition.  She remained intubated.  She remained in sinus
rhythm.  Given the hematocrit of 23, she was transfused with
two units of blood.  She continued to make adequate urine.
The patient was extubated on postoperative day one which she
tolerated well.  She remained arousable and responsive.  Her
heart rate and blood pressure remained stable.

Physical Therapy was consulted which followed the patient
throughout her hospitalization.

The patient was transferred to the Floor on postoperative day
three.  She was noted to be wheezing and appeared mildly
fluid overloaded on examination.  A chest x-ray showed
atelectasis and right sided pleural effusion.  She was
diuresed further with good response.

Respiratory Care was called which gave the patient nebulizer
treatments with good response.  She was encouraged to use
incentive spirometry.  The patient was also noted to be
slightly hypertensive and her medications were adjusted
accordingly.

A repeat chest x-ray showed improvement in both lung fields.

The patient was discharged to the [**Hospital3 **]
facility on [**2150-11-11**].
