Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
aortic stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2194-1-21**]
TAVI-Aortic Valve Replacement via Right Thoracotomy ([**Company 1543**]
29 mm porcine CoreValve)


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 36776**] is an 84 year old man with severe symptomatic aortic
stenosis a history of coronary bypass grafting in [**2185**] at the
[**Hospital1 18**] (LIMA to LAD, SVG-PDA,SVG-OMB),atrial fibrillation, severe
obstructive lung disease, peripheral vascular disease, carotid
artery disease, post-polio
syndrome, pulmonary hypertension.

He was seen approximately 6 months ago for aortic valve
treatment options. He was determined to be of prohibitively
extreme risk for surgical aortic valve replacement due to
frailty. He was undergoing evaluation for TAVI with incidental
findings of a pulmonary nodule. Workup included a repeat CT scan
of the chest which showed improvement of the nodule consistent
with resolving a infectious process.

He returned for Corevalve procedure via direct aortic approach.
He continues to be symptomatic with the ability ambulate bed to
bathroom before being limited by shortness of breath.

TTE [**2194-1-25**]: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. An aortic
CoreValve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis
appears well seated, with normal leaflet motion and
transvalvular gradients. Mild (1+) perivalvular aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild to moderate ([**1-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Well seated CoreValve aortic prosthesis with normal
gradient Mild perivalvular aortic regurgitation. Mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild-moderate mitral
regurgtiation. Pulmonary artery hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2194-1-23**],
the severity of aortic regurgitation has increased/more
apparent. The severity of mitral regurgitation, tricuspid
regurgitation, and estimated PA systolic pressure are now
reduced.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2189**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis IS recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.

Brief Hospital Course:
H e was admitted [**1-20**] and completed pre-op work up.  He underwent
TAVI// CoreValve via mini right thoracotomy with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] on
[**1-21**]. He was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition and
extubated later that day. He transferred to the floor on POD #1
to begin increasing his activity level.

The chest tubes were removed per protocol. He remains with his
chronic indwelling Foley. Coumadin was restarted for chronic
atrial fibrillation and Plavix was given and discontinued when
the INR reached 2. Beta blockade and ACE inhibitors were given.
he was diuresed towards his preoperative weight and edema had
essentially cleared by discharge.  He continued to make good
progress and was cleared for discharge to [**Hospital **] Rehab on
[**2194-1-28**], POD 7.  The atrial pacer lead was found to have a high
impedance on evaluation [**1-28**], having been normal on [**1-25**].  The
Electrophysiology Service felt this could be evaluated by his
primary cardiologist after rehab discharge.

He was walking with assistance and a walker at discharge and
Lisinopril and Lopressor were titrated to good blood pressure
control.
