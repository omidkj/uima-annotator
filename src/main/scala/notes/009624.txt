Fever

None

History of Present Illness:
73F with paraplegia, recurrent UTI, chronic sacral decubs,
presenting with fever and altered mental status. She was seen by
her NP yesterday with fever to 102 and positive UA. Her sacral
decub was noted to be improved since last exam. Cipro started
for UTI. Also seen by her visiting nurse today and son reported
that overnight she was confused, talking about getting up to
walk (though paraplegic) and ?visual hallucinations. Per son,
this is similar to when she has had UTIs in the past. She does
admit to sore throat and cough for a few days. Cough
nonproductive though feels she has something to cough up. No
shortness of breath or chest pain. No GI symptoms. No known
sick/flu contacts. [**Name (NI) **] recalls incident in which she told
her son she was going to get up and walk, and thought she was
dreaming. Pt DNR/[**Name6 (MD) 835**] [**Name8 (MD) **] NP.

In the ED, initial vs were: T98.4 77 115/60 18 92% on RA.
Initially tried on 2 L O2 but O2 sats drifted to upper 80s, thus
increased to 4L. Initially normotensive with subsequent BP down
again to upper 80s despite 3 L NS. CXR with ?RLL process but
officially read as no acute process. UA positive. Received vanco
and levofloxacin. Debating MICU vs. floor admission but
ultimately admitted to MICU given borderline BPs and O2 sats.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain or
tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or
bladder habits. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

in last few years. No alcohol or illicit drug use.


Family History:

Physical Exam:
General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, PERRL 4->2, MM slightly dry, posterior
oropharynx very difficult to fully visualize.
Neck: supple, JVD to 4 cm ASA, no LAD
Lungs: Few expiratory rhonchi, L>R. No crackles.
CV: Distant heart sounds. Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 +
S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops
Abdomen: appears grossly distended, though unchanged per
patient. Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present, no rebound
tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly. Suprapubic catheter
site appears benign.
Back: stage IV sacral decub, appears to be down to bone, approx
4x4cm. No drainage or significant surrounding erythema, appears
to have good granulation tissue.
Ext: Slightly cool hands otherwise warm and well perfused, no
clubbing, cyanosis. Trace UE and LE edema, equal bilaterally.
Small pressure ulcers on bilateral heels.
Neuro: Alert and appropriate. CN II-XII intact, UE strength and
sensation preserved. LE sensation and movement absent. No
sensation from abdomen inferiorly.

CXR [**2138-10-15**]: The patient is rotated for the examination. The
lungs are clear without consolidation or edema. Again seen is
massive dilation and ectasia of the thoracic aorta with a
particular contour abnormality noted along the course of the
descending thoracic aorta. The cardiac silhouette size is within
normal limits. No definite effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
Chronic bony deformity consistent likely with prior left
thoracotomy is stable. Numerous surgical clips are noted over
the mediastinum. IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process.
Markedly dilated and ectatic aorta similar to prior studies but
accentuated by rotation. There is a focal outpouching along the
course of the descending thoracic aorta which may be
superimposition of pulmonary vessels or true contour abnormality
suggesting true or false aneurysm formation.
Addendum: In retrospect, in comparison to multiple prior
radiographs, the contour of the descending thoracic aorta is
stable and is unlikely to represent an acute process.
Additionally, there is subtle silhouetting of the right
hemidiaphragm which may correspond to increased opacity noted on
the lateral view. Atelectasis or an early infiltrate involving
the right lower lobe cannot be entirely excluded.
.
EKG: NSR at 74, normal intervals, borderline LAD, poor RWP, no
ST/T changes, overall minimally changed from prior.
.
[**2138-10-19**] KUB: FINDINGS: Comparison is made to the prior CT scan
and radiographs from [**2138-4-11**].
Similar to the prior studies, there was again seen marked
distention of
several small bowel loops. There is also stool and air is seen
throughout the colon.
No free intraperitoneal air is seen on the decubitus
radiographs. CT scan
will be helpful for further evaluation of the area of
obstruction. There is again noted a fracture deformity involving
the left proximal femur at the intertrochanteric region which is
unchanged since [**2137-10-5**].


Brief Hospital Course:
73F with paraplegia, COPD, recurrent UTI, presenting with UTI,
confusion, mild hypoxia and relative hypotension.

# Hypotension. Pt was mildly low BP's with baseline 100-110's.
Pt responded to IV fluids. Cardaic enzymes were neg. Likely [**1-6**]
to UTI/urosepsis. Pt was given [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test which responded
appropriately.

# Hypoxia. Pt was on home oxygen in past for COPD, though not
currently. No evidence of PNA. Pt's O2 requirement was weaned,
and pt was also given nebs.

# Fever. Pt has fever to 101 at NP's office but was afebrile
during hospital stay. Likely [**1-6**] to UTI. Sacral decub appears
well. Ortho consulted regarding possibility of osteo, however
rec biopsy at a time when pt is off all antibiotics for at least
5 days. Pt was initially started on Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro for
complicated UTI, then eventually [**Last Name (un) 4662**] down to PO Cefpodoxime
for a total of 14 day course (last dose on [**10-28**]). Blood cx were
neg and flu swab was neg. First urine cx had fecal contamination
but subsequent one was neg.

# UTI. Has had a number of FQ and 2nd-3rd genereation
cephalosporin resistent organisms in the past. Also had history
of enterococcus in the past. On Bactrim prophylaxis at home. Pt
was thus initially started on Vanc/Zosyn/Cipro given
hypotension, then transitioned to PO Cefpodoxime for a total of
14d course (last day [**10-28**]). Pt improved clinically and remained
afebrile.

# Suprapubic catheter. Changed q month and needs to be changed.

# Sacral decub. Stage IV, did not appear overtly infected. Was
followed by wound care during hospital stay.

# Abdominal distension. Patient's abdomen is chronically
distended, but soft, no signs of an acute abdomen.  KUB on [**10-19**]
showed marked distention of
several small bowel loops, but similar to the prior studies.
also, no free intraperitoneal air was seen. Patient reports this
distension is no change from baseline. Pt did not have BMs for
several days. Bowel regimen was then escalated, with pt having
soft BMs by the day of discharge. If there is again a concern
regarding distension, a repeat KUB can be performed to reassess.
.
# Paraplegia. Was stable, pt was continued h
