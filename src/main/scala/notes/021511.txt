PA AND LATERAL CHEST.

HISTORY: 49-year-old male with CABG. Evaluate for interval
change.

FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous study from [**2111-3-20**].

There is a right IJ central venous catheter with distal lead tip
at the
cavoatrial junction. There are areas of plate-like atelectasis
at both lung
bases, which are relatively stable. There is no overt pulmonary
edema. There
is a small right-sided pleural effusion.

Findings
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Mildly depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. No
MVP. Normal mitral valve supporting structures.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Normal tricuspid valve supporting structures. No TS.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - bandages,
defibrillator pads or electrodes.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) secondary to
akinesis of the apical third of the interventricular septum and
hypokinesis of the apex. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared to previous study of [**2111-3-13**], the left ventricular
ejection fraction is increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted for cardiac evaluation and underwent cardiac
catheterization which revealed coronary artery disease.  Cardiac
surgery was consulted and he underwent preoperative workup.  He
remained in the hospital due to chest pain with ambulation and
was brought to the operating room on [**2111-3-18**] for coronary artery
bypass graft surgery.  See operative report for further details.
 He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to
intensive care unit for management.  He awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated postoperatively without difficulty.
Physical therapy worked with him on strength and mobility.  He
continued to progress, [**Last Name (un) 387**] was consulted for diabetes
management due to hgba1c of 10 preoperatively.  His insulin was
adjusted and he was ready for discharge home with services on
post operative day 6.
