   Respiratory Viral Antigen Screen (Final [**2153-4-7**]):
      Negative for Respiratory Viral Antigen.
      Specimen screened for: Adeno, Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3,
Influenza A, B,
      and RSV by immunofluorescence.
      Refer to respiratory viral culture for further
information.

   Respiratory Viral Culture (Final [**2153-4-9**]):
      No respiratory viruses isolated.
      Culture screened for Adenovirus, Influenza A & B,
Parainfluenza type
      1,2 & 3, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus..
      Detection of viruses other than those listed above will
only be
      performed on specific request. Please call Virology at
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 6182**]
      within 1 week if additional testing is needed

Imaging:
CTA:
1. No pulmonary emboli or aortic dissection.
2. Mild-to-moderate emphysema.
3. Subcentimeter left lower lobe pulmonary nodule, stable since
[**2149**]. No
followup indicated.
4. Mild-to-moderate emphysema. Mild bronchiectasis, less
inflamed today than
previously.

Echo:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is premature appearance of contrast in the left atrium
after Valsalva release c/w a small PFO (more prominent
microbubbles are seen with cough - but they appear late and c/w
transpulmonic flow). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The diameters
of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2151-12-16**], a
small patent foramen ovale with transient right-to-left flow is
now identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 YO F with COPD/RAD on home O2, diastolic CHF, recent TKR,
presenting with two weeks of shortness of breath with acute
worsening x 1 day.
.
# COPD exacerbation: Upon admission, possibly etiologies of
hypoxia included PNA, RAD, COPD exacerbation, heart failure,
coronary ischemia or possibly PE.  CTA negative in ED and CXR
without clear PNA, and she received one dose of Azithromycin
which completed her 5 day outpatient course.  Nasal swab DFA was
negative for viruses or influenza.  Cardiac enzymes were cycled
and negative and serial ECGs Q12 were unchanged. Wheezing on
exam was concerning for COPD so she was treated with
methylprednisone IV and she was also started on standing nebs
and continued on her home inhalers.  When her 02 mask was taken
off she quickly desatted to the 70s so there was concern for
shunt/PFO and an echo with bubble study was ordered which showed
only a very small PFO, which as per cardiology, does not account
for her desaturations.

Eventually, she was started on an additional course of levaquin,
and a very slow prednisone taper. She improved very gradually to
her baseline, requiring 2L O2 at rest and up to 4L O2 with
minimal exertion. She still continues to have cough and
significant shortness of breath, meriting acute pulmonary rehab.

.
#AVNRT: Patient had new AVNRT on this hospital admission. She
was uptitrated to an eventual dose of Diltiazem 90mg QID and
Digoxin 0.25mcg daily, with good effect. Diltiazem was switched
to long-acting and she tolerated this well. EP saw her inhouse
and recommended outpatient AVNRT ablation once she is more
stable from a respiratory standpoint (as she would have to lie
flat for the procedure).
.
# Chronic Diastolic CHF: Patient was continued on ACEi, with low
Na diet and fluid restriction 1500cc/day. She was not maintained
on a beta blocker given her respiratory status.
.
# DM type II.  As outpatient, patient was only taking metformin
and glipizide. However, while on high doses of prednisone, her
sugars were very poorly controlled and required lantus with
insulin sliding scale. Her regimen will need to be titrated as
her dose of steroids is tapered. Her glipizide was continued,
metformin was held.
.
# Hypertension.   Patient was continued on HCTZ. Captopril was
switched to lisinopril for easier dosing.
.
# Leukocytosis: Felt to be secondary to prednisone use.
.
# Left lower lung nodule: On CTA, patient incidentally noted to
have nodule (see above), which will require outpatient
follow-up.

****OUTPATIENT ISSUES TO F/U:
1. Left lung nodule
2. Glycemic control
