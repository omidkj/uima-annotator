BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE
The patient was admitted to the MICU on [**3-3**] given the rapid
progression of his facial swelling and periorbital edema.  In
the ED he was noted to be febrile to 102 but hemodynamically
stable with a Creatinine of 2.1, leukocytosis of 23.1.  He was
given vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and flagyl and admitted to the
MICU.  He was seen by opthalmology and otolaryngology.

On [**3-4**] the patient became progressively hemodynamically
unstable and was started on levophed for pressure support.  CT
scan of the head and neck and CTA revealed subcutaneous
inflammatory changes, subgaleal soft tissue edema, right greater
than left, extending into the right preauricular and preseptal
areas and neck down to the level of the thyroid, but no evidence
of drainable fluid collection, subcutaneous emphysema, gas
formation, or thrombus.

His erythema and edema were thought initially to be improving on
antibiotics, but given his hemodynamic instability and concern
for necrotizing fasciitis the patient was taken to the operating
room by otolaryngology on [**3-5**] for neck exploration, irrigation
and debridement of necrotizing fasciitis of right face and neck
and left neck.  Pathology results showed necrosis of
fibroadipose and muscle, no fascia seen, abscess, and GPCs in
pairs/clusters/chains.

Postoperatively the patient entered florid sepsis; he became
more hemodynamically unstable and acidemic to 7.2, his WBC rose
to a high of 41, and he was placed on three pressors, (levophed,
neo, and vasopressin), though he continued to have urine output.
 Eventually he became more hemodynamically stable, but given his
continued need for pressors, leukocytosis, and spreading
erythema down the chest, the patient was taken to the OR again
on [**3-6**] for neck exploration, irrigation and debridement of
necrotizing fasciitis of inferior neck.

Infectious Disease had been consulted, and from [**3-3**] - [**3-6**] the
patient was maintained on linezolid, flagyl, and ceftazidime.

On [**3-7**] he was weaned off pressors, and his white count
decreased, but he developed atrial fibrillation with a regular
ventricular rate but with resulting hypotension, and so was
started on amiodarone.

His cultures from [**3-2**] in the blood at [**Location (un) 620**] grew Group A beta
hemolytic strep; his wound cultures on [**3-4**] grew out staph coag
negative and [**3-5**], [**3-6**], grew group A beta-hemolytic strep. Given
these results on [**3-7**] his antibiotics were changed to clindamycin
and penicillin G per ID recommendations.

The erythema on his chest continued to spread, however, and so
he was given one dose of vancomycin and then placed on linezolid
for its toxin-fighting effects, with discontinuation of
clindamycin, per ID.  He was also taken back to the operating
room on [**3-8**] for concern with worsening necrotizing fasciiting;
he underwent neck exploration, wash out and debridement of neck.
 The tissue following debridement was noted per report to be
healthy without signs of infection.

Postoperatively the patient's erythema was noted to be
decreasing and his hemodynamics improving.  On [**3-9**] he was placed
on PO amiodarone but then put back on IV on [**3-10**] as he converted
back to AF, and he was started on a heparin drip.  On [**3-9**] he was
started on a lasix drip in order to diurese him as he was now
hemodynamically stable but 21 liters positive.

On [**3-10**] the patient was extubated without difficulty.  On [**3-10**] he
was thought to be moving the right hand less than the left, and
so given his previous periods of hypotension he underwent a
NCHCT, that was negative for acute infarct.

On [**3-11**] his WBC rose to 24 from 16.7 and so given concern for
alternate sources of infection he was checked for C dif, his CVL
was changed, a UA was negative, and CXR showed b/l pleural
effusions.  He remained with a persistent le
