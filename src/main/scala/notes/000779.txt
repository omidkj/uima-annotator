CTA
1. No evidence of aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, or
etiology for acute shortness of breath identified. No interval
change in multiple metastatic nodules within the chest.
2. Marked atherosclerotic disease involving the aorta and
coronary circulation.
3. Unchanged appearance of sclerotic foci within the thoracic
vertebral bodies which are worrisome for metastatic disease.
4. Reidentification of a left adrenal nodule with Hounsfield
units suggesting that it is a benign adenoma. If alteration
clinical management will occur this can be further evaluated
with dedicated CT adrenal protocol or MRI.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Transmitral
Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I
(mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.


Brief Hospital Course:
INFLUENZA / SEPSIS
Ms. [**Known lastname 93123**] was initally admitted to the intensive care unit
from the emergency department with sepsis, fever, hypotension.
The patient did have CTA which showed no e/o PE and also had
serial cardiac enzymes which showed no new MI. She was found to
be influenza A positive, and treated with oseltamivir for five
day course. She was called out to the floor after brief stay.
She did not require mechanical ventilation or vasopressor
support.

COPD
The patient was treated for COPD exacerbation in the setting of
influenza.
She received po pulse of prednisone for five days. She received
azithromycin for five days.  She required frequent nebulizer
treatments that became less frequent over time. She was still on
1L NC for sats in the low 90s. She should be titrated to range
of 89-94%, as higher O2 sats can worsen COPD.

HYPERTENSION
The patient was hypertensive in setting of steroids requiring
PRN hydralazine, worse at night. This improved after steroids.
She is being discharged on her most recent outpatient
medications.

LUNG NODULES
The patient has suspicious lung nodules on CT and history of
endometrial cancer. She had recent bronchoscopy last admission,
which was negative for malignancy. However, this was not a very
sensitive test. Our team felt that if the patient desired, she
should be seen in thoracic oncology clinic.
