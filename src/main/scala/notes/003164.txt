Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3531**]
Chief Complaint:
Back pain, fever.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Elective endotracheal intubation for MRI.

History of Present Illness:
72M with MDS, recently discharged from 12R for diffuse body pain
without improvement or diagnosis, initially planned for direct
admit back to 12R. However, given slowed mental status, refusing
speaking per family, evaluated in ED. Initially in ED VS 104.3
114 141/59 18 99. Pt refusing conversation but followed
commands. Labs significant for new renal failure Cr 2.7, with K
5.7, AP 377, Na 131, WBC 3.5 with 61%N and 9% bands, HCT 29.2,
Plt 128, lactate 1.6. UA pending.
Infectious workup showed CXR, CT head negative. Covered
empirically for meningitis Vanc, CTX, ampicillin.
.
Family reported severe lower back pain and numbness in lower
extremities, fever - concern for epidural abscess. Plan for MRI
without contrast given renal failure, which was initiated but pt
unable to tolerate due to agitation. Able to get C spine and
part of T spine, ? epidimoma, intrathecal mass c1-2. Anesthesia
intubated with 7.5 on propofol gtt. CXR confirmed placement of
ETT and OG tube. Insufficient staffing to get MRI in ED.
.
Renal failure - baseline 1.5-1.6. No change in PO intake.
Unclear cause. Given kayexalate 30, no EKG changes. No stools.
Gotten 2L IVF.
.
VS on transfer:
 Temp 99.6. HR 125 since intubation, previously 90s, BP 135/69,
AC 100, TV 450, 5PEEP, 12 PS, rate 20s. MV 10L.
.
Of note, during recent admission, pt presented with diffuse pain
and source not identified. DDx included neutrogen related, MDS
bony pain, lytic bony lesions (SPEP pending at discharge, now
neg). Planned for outpt bone marrow biopsy

.
CT HEAD:
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema,
mass, mass effect, or large vascular territorial infarction.
Mild prominence of the ventricles and sulci is compatible with
mild diffuse atrophy which is age-appropriate. There is no acute
fracture. Included views of the mastoid air cells and paranasal
sinuses are clear. There is moderate calcification of the
cavernous segments of both internal carotid arteries, left
greater than right.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.
.
MRI:
1. 22 x 7 mm intramedullary mass within the cervical spinal cord
from C2 to C3 which is hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging, with
areas of lower signal intensity within the mid superior aspect.
There may be an associated syrinx. This finding could represent
a neoplastic process such as an astrocytoma.

2. There are multiple nodules within the lungs. Therefore, an
intramedullary spinal metastasis is not excluded. Chest CT is
recommended.

3. 11 x 8 mm right parotid lesion, T2 hyperintense may represent
a cystic mass or node, and less likely a pleomorphic adenoma.

4. Multilevel degenerative changes throughout the cervical and
thoracic spine, with partial ankylosis of C3 to C5 with bulky
anterior osteophytes.

5. Rounded T1 hyperintense, T2 hypointense lesion within T6 and
T2 hypointense lesions within the right T7 (with posterior
extension), may
represent metastases. These areas can be re-evaluated at the
time of CT.

6. Elevated creatinine levels precluded the use of gadolinium.

7. No evidence of epidural abscess.

8. Trace secretions within the trachea.

FINDINGS: I concur with Dr.[**Name (NI) 85131**] very comprehensive analysis.
Additionally, there are multiple sternotomy sutures. There is no
paravertebral soft tissue swelling to suggest an ongoing
inflammatory process.

CONCLUSION: Intramedullary mass within the upper cervical cord.
See above  report for differential diagnosis. Degenerative
changes of the cervical spine. Please see above report for
numerous additional observations.

COMMENT: Please note that the present study contained imaging
only as far distally as T9, as the patient was unable to
continue the procedure at this time.
.
MRI HEAD:
 Non-enhanced study with:
1. No evidence of intracranial mass or cerebral edema.
2. Moderate global atrophy.
3. Diffusely and uniformly T1-hypointense regional bone marrow
signal, as on the recent MR examinations of the spine; this
likely relates to the apparently known underlying
myelodysplastic syndrome
.
MRI Lumbar:
Findings of concern for metastatic neoplastic disease involving
the visualized lower thoracic and lumbar spine, with additional
findings as
noted above.

Bone Scan [**2175-4-13**]:
IMPRESSION: Widespread foci of abnormal tracer activity
throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton as described
above. Pattern most compatible with widespread osseous
metastasis from an unknown primary.

CXR [**2175-4-14**]:
All these support lines and tubes have now been removed. Cardiac
size is at
the upper limits of normal. No failure is present. There is some
loss of the
right heart border suggesting infiltrate in right middle lobe.

IMPRESSION: Probable right middle lobe pneumonia.

CXR [**2175-4-16**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the mid lobe
opacity is
unchanged. In addition, a small left suprabasal opacity has
occurred that
could correspond to local atelectasis.

Otherwise, there is no relevant change. Unchanged size of the
cardiac
silhouette. Unchanged absence of pulmonary edema. Unchanged
absence of
pleural effusions. Old right-sided clavicular fracture.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

PATHOLOGY PENDING AT TIME OF DISCHARGE


Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo M with MDS, chronic back pain of unknown source with
recent neg eval, returns with back pain, fever, AMS.
.
# Fever: Patient admitted with fever and concurrent rise in WBC
from 2s to 3.6 and diff changed from 3 30-40% neutrophils and no
bands, to 61%N and 9%bands. Given the back pain there was
concern for epidural abcess. Patient was started on Vanc/CTX
2g/Ampi for meningitis. MRI r/o abcess (no contrast given
creatinine of 2.7), but showed metastatic disease to
