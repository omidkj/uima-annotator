Admission Date:  [**2176-8-2**]       Discharge Date:  [**2176-8-15**]

Date of Birth:   [**2124-7-12**]       Sex:  F

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52 year-old
female status post aortic valve replacement on [**2176-7-17**] who
presented with subtherapeutic INR of 1.8 to the Medicine
Service.  The patient had a long standing history of aortic
stenosis of uncertain etiology, which became symptomatic for
the first time in [**3-7**].  The patient began experiencing
dizziness and substernal burning with exercise.  An
echocardiogram on [**2176-6-13**] showed moderate [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 13385**],
moderate left ventricular hypertrophy, EF of 55%, severely
thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.  Cardiac
catheterization on [**2176-7-9**] showed severe AS with aortic valve
area of .5 cm squared, mean AV gradient of 49 mmHg, moderate
pulmonary hypertension with no significant mitral
regurgitation and no significant coronary artery disease.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] performed minimally invasive aortic valve
replacement on [**2176-7-17**] with 21 mm Carbomedics mechanical
valve.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and recovery
in the hospital was complicated by only some wheezing, mild
shortness of breath that improved with aggressive diuresis
and bronchodilators.  The patient was Coumadinized after
surgery with a goal INR of 2.5 to 3.  The patient was
discharged to home on [**2176-7-25**] with visiting nurse coming on
[**7-27**] for INR checks.  INR was 3.6 predischarge and drifted to
2.7 on [**7-27**] while the patient was taken 2 mg of Warfarin q.d.
 Even with increased Warfarin dosage 2 mg to 4 mg alternating
the patient's INR drifted down to 1.8 on [**7-30**] at which time
she was referred to [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Department for management.  During the time after
her discharge from the hospital [**7-25**] the patient reports no
nausea, vomiting, fevers or chills, shortness of breath, only
some pain in chest near incision that was described as
positional.

2.  Asthma, no systemic steroids, no intubations for asthma
in history.
3.  Thyroiditis.
4.  Status post right oophorectomy.

ALLERGIES:  Vioxx causes a rash.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. times two weeks, day eight on day of
admission.
2.  Potassium chloride 20 milliequivalents b.i.d. times two
weeks, day eight on admission.
3.  Atenolol 75 mg q.d.

6.  Albuterol MDI two puffs.
7.  Percocet 5/325 one to two tabs q 4 prn, had been taking
about two tabs per day on admission.
8.  Colace 100 mg b.i.d. while on Percocet.
9.  Coumadin alternating 2 mg and 4 mg.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a widow.  She lives with
brother and grandfather in [**Location (un) 686**] who have been taking
care of her "very well" since surgery.  Employed as a
cleaning nurse until late 70s when she quit to take care of
her children and then grandchildren.  No smoking history.  No
alcohol now, minimal in remote past.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Two brothers with coronary artery disease.
Three other siblings who are healthy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs 99.0, 73,
139/87, 18, 95% on room air.  General, she was an obese
female lying comfortably in no acute distress, alert and
oriented times three.  HEENT examination normocephalic,
atraumatic female with pupils are equal, round, and reactive
to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements intact.
No JVD.  Chest was clear to auscultation and percussion
bilaterally.  No rales, wheezes or rhonchi.  Cardiovascularly
the patient had a surgical scar well healing along sternum
approximately 12 cm long with regular rate and rhythm.  Loud
click on S2 especially on right upper sternal border.  No
murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen was soft, obese, nontender
with positive bowel sounds.  Extremities showed no edema
bilaterally.  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count of 12.6,
hematocrit 31.4 and platelets 652.  [**Name (NI) 2591**] PT 17.5, PTT 26.6
and INR of 2.0.  Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly without
consolidation without congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was then admitted to the
Medicine Service and started on a heparin drip to increase
anticoagulation.  INR remained around 2 on hospital day one
and two, however, after 24 hours the patient was
anticoagulated and the patient was complaining of increasing
shortness of breath and hypotension on the floor.  Primary
team performed a transthoracic echocardiogram, which showed
well seated and functioning prosthetic valve and tamponade
physiology.  On conclusion of the echocardiogram the patient
became unresponsive and the patient arrested.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed and
cardiothoracic surgery was emergently called for
pericardiocentesis at the bedside.  The patient was
resuscitated for PEA arrest after the anterior pericardial
hematoma was seen on echocardiogram and cardiothoracic
surgery began to make a skin incision in order to perform the
pericardiocentesis.  Skin incision was made, however,
immediately femoral pulses were detected and the patient was
then wheeled directly to the Operating Room for emergent
pericardial window procedure via subxiphoid approach for
pericardia tamponade.  The patient tolerated the procedure
well.  One chest tube was placed postoperatively.  The
patient did well immediately postoperatively, however, blood
work at that time showed increasing liver function tests with
transaminases to the 1000 and INR of 66.  The liver was
deemed to be in shock.  Liver function tests began to fall on
their own and INR began to normalize spontaneously in the
ensuring days postoperatively.  By postoperative day three
the patient was extubated and INR was down to 30.

On postoperative day five the patient went slightly into
atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, however, reverted with
beta blockade.  By postoperative day seven the patient's INR
was down to 2.5 on 3 mg of Coumadin a day and 2.1 on
postoperative day eight.  Coumadin doses were then adjusted
according to INR levels and the patient was continued on 3 mg
of Coumadin until postoperative day nine when she was
decreased to 2 mg of Coumadin and had INR steady of 2.4 for
postoperative days 10 and 11 the day of discharge.  The
patient did extremely well on the floor and was transferred
to the floor earlier on in hospital course on postoperative
day seven and was discharged on postoperative day 11 in no
acute distress.  The patient did have slight wound separation
in the subxiphoid pericardial window incision and was placed
on Levofloxacin 500 mg q day times six days for this.
