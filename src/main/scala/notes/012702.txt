Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, cough, fever, chills

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
37M alpha-1-trypsin deficiency and IVDU (reportedly injected
cocaine 2 days ago) who presented to the ED w/ subjective F/C
and productive cough x 3 days. (+)SOB, No CP.  Reportedly BS
500's x 2 days which he attempted to cover with RISS.
.
Above hx per ED note, on initial presentation to MICU team, pt
was intubated and unable to provide further history.
.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt with significant respirtory distress, breathing RR
30-40, HR 130s, Pox 90s on NRB.  Initial gas on NRB was
7.47/25/64/19.  Said he felt a little better after antibiotics
(ceftriaxone 1 g x 1, vancomycin 1 mg IV x 1), steroids
(solumedrol 100 mg IV x 1), regular insulin 12 units ?IV x 1.
Subsequent gas showed 7.37/33/104/20. Was eventually intubated
[**2-5**] septic shock.
.
After intubation, pt continued with RR 40 (? decreased BS on L)
and SBP decreased to 70s with increased sedation (was given
propofol).  Given above findings and agitation, was given
vecuronium 10 mg (paralyzed him despite steroids).  He was then
placed on SIMV 700 x 14, PEEP 5, Fio2 100%.  SBP dropped,
started on dopa, then subsequently given neo.  Femoral placed,
levophed given.  Foley placed.
.
Temperature finally taken 102.4.  HR 140s.  SBP 90s on levophed
(other pressors stopped).
.
In the MICU, pt was treated for sepsis [**2-5**] nectrotizing MSSA PNA
with MSSA bacteremia. He initially required pressors for BP
support, but was quickly weaned off once ABX were initiated and
he was HD stable. He received vanco/CTX/azithro for his
PNA/bacteremia, changed to Flagyl/oxacillin/ceftaz when
sensitivities came back. His MICU course was notable for
agitation, making him difficult to wean off the vent and labile
blood glucose levels, requiring insulin gtt. His agitation was
initially thought [**2-5**] ETT; however, he continued to have
episodes of agitation upon extubation, which resolved with
increasing fentanyl and methadone doses. Given pt's agitation
and periods of hypoxia, pt had an MRI to r/o structural/acute
brain injury and EEG to evaluate for hypoxic encephalopathy. MRI
showed no abnormalities and an EEG which showed abnormal bursts
of generalized slowing and a relatively low voltage monotonous,
unresponsive background suggestive of a widespread
encephalopathy. Medications appeared to be the most likely
etiology of these findings. His agitation resolved and fentanyl
gtt was switched to oxycontin and fentanyl patch. As his acute
issues had resolved and he was stable form HD and respiratory
standpoints, he was transferred to the floor for further
management.

Studies:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2110-5-5**] 6:35 PM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP); -76 BY SAME PHYSICIAN

Reason: r/o PTX

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
37 year old man s/p tube placement
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o PTX
INDICATION: 37-year-old status post tube placement, evaluate for
pneumothorax.

AP CHEST: The endotracheal tube is unchanged in position. There
is no pneumothorax. Essentially unchanged appearance of right
midlung zone and right lower lobe alveolar opacification. The
left lung zone remains unaffected. The left CP angle is excluded
from this film. No other interval change.

IMPRESSION: Persisting right middle lung zone and right lower
lobe alveolar opacification, unchanged from prior film. No other
interval change.

ECHO:
Conclusions:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
There is
moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis. Right ventricular
chamber size
is normal with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The mitral
valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
a
trivial/physiologic anterior pericardial effusion.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT 100CC NON IONIC CONTRAST

Reason: eval for ? cavitations seen on CXR
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
37 y/o M w/alpha-1 antitripsyn deficiency, type 1 DM, and IVDU,
who was admitted with pna. Now with worsening pna, fevers, and
new cavitary lesions seen on CXR (or possible bullae [**2-5**] alpha
1?). Also look for effusion.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for ? cavitations seen on CXR
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Worsening pneumonia
and fever.

Helical CT of the chest was performed following intravenous
administration of 100 cc of Optiray. Nonionic contrast was
administered due to the patient's limited respiratory status.

Comparison is made to multiple prior portable chest radiographs
dating between [**2110-5-8**], and [**2110-5-5**].

The lungs demonstrate multifocal consolidation throughout the
right lung, affecting the right lower lobe to a greater degree
than the right upper and right middle lobes. This is
superimposed upon underlying extensive emphysema. Multifocal
ground-glass opacities are also noted, adjacent to areas of
consolidation in the right lung and scattered within the left
lung. Some consolidative changes are noted in the left lower
lobe, but most of consolidation is within the right lung.
Multiple small cystic lucencies are seen throughout the right
lung, consistent with underlying emphysema. However, within some
of the areas of consolidation, there are larger lucent areas,
particularly within the right upper lobe on image 22, with an
appearance suggestive of cavitary necrotic pneumonia. Similarly,
within the right lower lobe, within areas of otherwise dense
consolidation, there are areas of rounded lucency suggesting
cavitation which do not communicate with bronchi. The appearance
of the consolidation within the right lower lobe also appears
heterogeneous with low-attenuation areas consistent with
necrosis. No frank abscess is identified at this time. There is
a small dependent left pleural effusion and a moderate dependent
right pleural effusion present. There are mildly enlarged
bilateral hilar and mediastinal nodes, likely reactive in the
setting of an acute pneumonia.

Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, the adrenal
glands are normal in appearance. No focal abnormalities ar
