Admission Date:  [**2139-10-13**]     Discharge Date:  [**2139-10-21**]

Date of Birth:   [**2090-7-7**]     Sex:  M

Service:  [**Location (un) 259**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 49 year-old
male with Crest syndrome who presents with worsening
shortness of breath and a Hickman catheter infection.  The
catheter was pulled and a new catheter for Flolan dose
therapy was placed on [**10-8**].  The patient was then
started on Flolan for pulmonary hypertension.  He had
originally been started on this medication in [**2139-3-21**].
His dose was titrated up to 50 nanograms per kilogram per
minute.  At baseline the patient uses O2 4 liters by nasal
cannula and his O2 sat is 92%.  Last echocardiogram showed
tricuspid regurgitation, PAH with PA pressures in the 60s.
He also had a small pericardial effusion.  After discharge
the patient developed worsening shortness of breath.  In
addition, his skin color has changed.  It has become beet
red. The patient thus represented for evaluation of Flolan
dose.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Crest syndrome with pulmonary hypertension.
2.  Bacteremia staph aureus.
3.  Cellulitis.
4.  Hypokalemia.
5.  Acute renal failure.
6.  Esophageal candidiasis.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 100/50.  Heart rate 80.
Respiratory rate 16.  Sating 94% on 4 liters.  Temperature
98.7.  HEENT clear oropharynx.  Mucous membranes are moist.
No lymphadenopathy appreciated on examination.  Pupils are
equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Beet red skin.  Skin was nontender.  Chest lungs
were relatively clear to auscultation.  Cardiovascular
regular rate and rhythm with a systolic murmur 2 out of 6
heard best at left upper sternal border.  Abdomen soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities sclerodermal changes
with thinning of fingers, autoamputation of distal
fingertips.  Neurological the patient was alert and oriented
times three.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medicine
Service for observation.  The plan was for him to undergo a
cardiac catheterization for evaluation of PA pressures while
his Flolan was titrated.  On [**2139-10-14**] the patient underwent
cardiac catheterization by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 919**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 911**].  This revealed
moderate pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension.  Normal
left and right sided filling pressures.  Cardiac output
elevated at baseline and increased further with oxygen and
nitric-oxide therapy.  Calculated peripheral vascular
resistance decreased from 215 dimes/seconds/cm squared to a
199 with oxygen to 137 with nitric-oxide.  Thus the plan with
this data was to transfer the patient to the VICU for down
titration of Flolan with PA catheter guidance.  The patient
was kept flat on his back and transferred to the VICU the
following day for down titration of Flolan while under
guidance of a PA catheter.  Pulmonary artery pressures were
noted to be 62/22 with a mean of 40 and a cardiac output of
7.24.  Flolan was started at 54 nanograms per kilogram per
minute with the plan to titrate down in increments of 2
nanograms over twenty minutes and to reassess.  Goal cardiac
output was 3 to 4.5.  Under this regimen the patient's Flolan
dose was titrated down to 19 nanograms per kilogram per
minute.  After this titration the patient reported increased
energy and less dyspnea on exertion.  In addition, the
redness in the patient's face markedly improved.  The patient
was walking around the floor without difficulty.  It was thus
the consensus of the medical team that the patient was stable
for discharge to home.  The patient was thus discharged home
on [**2139-10-17**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Crest syndrome.
2.  Pulmonary hypertension.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:

4.  Diltiazem ER 420 mg po q.d.
5.  Pantoprazole 40 mg po b.i.d.
6.  Lorazepam 0.5 mg q 4 to 6 hours prn.
7.  Fluoxetine 20 mg po q.d.
8.  Loperamide 2 mg q.i.d. prn.
9.  Multivitamin.
10.  Epoprostenol sodium 0.5 mg vials running at a rate of 19
nanograms per kilogram per minute intravenous drip infusions.
11.  Tylenol prn.
12.  Potassium 40 milliequivalents po q day.

The patient was set up with a follow up appointment with Dr.
[**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2139-10-23**].
