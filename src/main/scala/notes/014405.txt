History of Present Illness:
This is a 72 year old female with PMH of moderate COPD with an
FEV1 of 57% in [**3-17**] not on any home inhalers or O2,
hypercholesterolemia, stable brain aneurysm, breast cancer
(T2N0, ER positive) s/p right breast lumpectomy in [**2181**] without
any recurrence, and s/p cecectomy in [**6-22**] for cecal volvulus
presenting with fever, productive cough, and worsening shortness
of breath for 10 days.  The patient has not measured her
temperature at home, but reports feeling warm, sweaty, and
having chills.  The patient also reports that her cough has
changed from being productive of thin, clear sputum to being
productive of pale yellow, thick sputum over the last 10 days.
She also reports having difficulty sleeping as of late because
she has not been able to lay flat.  She has been sleeping
sitting up on her couch.  Her shortness of breath has also
worsened.  At baseline, prior to [**Month (only) 359**], she says that she was
able to climb 2 flights of stairs without stopping to rest.  She
now reports that she will be completely winded after walking
just [**8-22**] feet.  She also has been more wheezy than usual.  She
does not take any inhalers at home and said that she tried
Advair once but didn't like how it made her feel.  She also
reports requiring oxygen at a nursing home after her surgery in
[**6-22**], but never required any home O2.  She reports that her
worsening shortness of breath was triggered by construction at
her house during which she was exposed to saw dust.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T=99.3, P=120, BP=111/57, RR=24,
POx=100%.  On arrival, the patient was satting 100% on NRB,
which then dipped to 80% on RA.  She was then transitioned to 8L
FM with continuous nebs.  She then became tachypneic to the 30s
but was able to speak in full sentences.  Her CXR showed
hyperinflated lungs and a multifocal PNA.  She received
continuous albuterol nebs, 125mg IV Solumedrol, PR Tylenol,
750mg IV Levofloxacin, and Azithromycin 500mg IV.  An EKG showed
no ischemic changes.  A UA was negative and an ABG was done
which showed pH=7.36/pCO2=61/pO2=64. Upon transfer her vitals
were HR=120, BP=109/44, RR=29, POx=93% on 8L FM.
.
On the floor, the patient appeared comfortable and was able to
speak in full sentences despite being tachypneic.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 72 year old female with PMH of moderate COPD with an
FEV1 of 57% in [**3-17**] not on any home inhalers or O2,
hypercholesterolemia, stable brain aneurysm, breast cancer
(T2N0, ER positive) s/p right breast lumpectomy in [**2181**] without
any recurrence, and s/p cecectomy in [**6-22**] for cecal volvulus who
presented with fever, productive cough, and worsening shortness
of breath for two weeks with findings most consistent with a
COPD exacerbation in the setting of an acute PNA. During her
admission she also sustained an ankle injury, which on Xray did
not demonstrate any fractures or dislocation.
.
#. COPD EXACERBATION: Pt with known history of COPD on no
medications, last seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] 5 years ago. Pt
presented with dyspnea, hypoxia with worsening productive cough
with fevers 1-2 weeks prior to presentation in setting of
environmental exacerbations (saw dust in home) c/w community
acquired pneumonia. Despite previous prescriptions for
nebulizers, she has never taken any COPD medications and she
continued to smoke 3 packs of cigarettes per day prior to her
admission. For treatment of her exacerbation, she was placed on
oxygen 4L NC and started on prednisone 60 mg daily, ipratropium
and albuterol nebulizers, mucinex 1200 mg [**Hospital1 **], and
dextromethorphran 60 mg [**Hospital1 **]. She was transitioned to tiotropium
bromide MDI daily and albuterol inhaler prn SOB and wheezing
>24H prior to discharge with bedside teaching; her respiratory
status remained stable with O2 requirement at 4L, O2 sats
remained at low 90s. Attempt to taper O2 to 3L resulted with O2
sats to 88% at rest. Her prednisone was decreased to 40 mg at
time of discharge. She was also started on calcium 1200 mg and
vitamin D 800 units for osteoporosis prevention. She was
discharged with home health services (O2 therapy,
cardiopulmonary assessment, skilled nursing) and encouraged to
follow up with outpatient pulmonary rehabilation. Patient was
discharged with close PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 702
