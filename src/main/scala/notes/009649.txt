Allergies:
morphine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH notable for CAD s/p 4V
CABG in [**2180**] in [**State 760**], atrial fibrillation on coumadin,
long standing diastolic CHF with most care received at [**Hospital1 112**],
anxiety, who presented to an outside hospital today with
palpitations and dyspnea in the setting of dietary indiscretions
and admitted to the CCU with presumed acute on chronic CHF
exacerbation.
.
She initially presented to the [**Hospital1 882**] ED, where she was found
to have troponin I of 0.4, CK of 128 CKMB not performed creatine
of 2.0, BNP of 16,000.  ECG notable for ?ST dep in II, III,
V4-V6.  She was given aspirin 325mg PO X 1, was placed on a
nitro gtt and bipap.  She was also given lasix 80 mg IV X 1 in
addition to the 80 mg po lasix that she had taken earlier in the
day.
.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation, where
initial vital signs were: P: 79, BP: 112/60, O2sat: 93% on
Bipap.  Her Bipap was weaned off and she was noted to have an
O2sat of 98% on 50% ventimask.  Her nitro gtt has also been
weaned. Her labs were notable for a WBC of 12.6, troponin T of
0.81, lactate of 3.3, potassium of 5.7, and creatinine of 2.4
(unclear baseline).  U/a was unremarkable.  ECG demonstrated ST
dep in II, III V4-V6 pt in afib.  Chest radiograph significant
for mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. She was started on
heparin gtt and admitted to the CCU for presumed acute on
chronic CHF exacerbation/NSTEMI.
.
On the floor, patient reports that her breathing has improved.
She denies any chest discomfort.  States she is usually very
compliant with her medications and diet at home, had perhaps
deviated a little with her diet on [**Holiday **] Eve more than a
week ago.  Her husband did mention that her weight was up by 2
lbs several days, however, the daily recorded weights did not
reflect this change.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

MICRO:
URINE CULTURE (Final [**2196-11-24**]):    NO GROWTH.

IMAGING:
ECG [**2196-11-23**]: Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular
response. Probable left ventricular hypertrophy with
repolarization changes. Intraventricular conduction delay. Poor
R wave progression across the precordium. There are T wave
inversions in leads I and aVL with ST segment depressions in
leads V4-V5 raising the possibility of active myocardial
ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. No previous tracing
available for comparison.

CXR [**2196-11-23**]
FINDINGS: Heart size is enlarged. There is mild interstitial
pulmonary
edema. Left pleural effusion may be present. No pneumothorax is
seen.
Sternal wires appear intact.
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly.

CXR [**2196-11-25**]
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-23**]:
Patient has had median sternotomy and coronary bypass grafting.
Cardiomegaly is severe with a large right heart component.
Perihilar opacification predominantly in the upper lungs
persists, but has improved in the lower lungs. I think this is
probably pulmonary edema, since there is accompanying small left
pleural effusion. It will be very helpful to have conventional
views including a lateral.
Thoracic aorta is heavily calcified, but at least in the upper
de
