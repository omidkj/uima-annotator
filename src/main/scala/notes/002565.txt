HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old
male with history of diabetes, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, CAD, ventricular tachycardia, status
post implantable defibrillator with newly diagnosed right
upper lobe [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital6 2561**] for
right main stem bronchus stent for recurrent ex vacuo
effusion, status post thoracentesis times three.  The patient
was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2200-2-17**], with
ventricular tachycardia following a motor vehicle accident.
An implantable defibrillator was placed at that time.  He was
then readmitted on [**2200-3-26**], for a recurrent pleural
effusion, for which he received a pigtail catheter and
consideration of possible pleurodesis.  However, he was not a
candidate for pleurodesis secondary to the pleural effusion
ex vacuo.  Thus CT surgery placed a chest tube, which was
accidentally pulled out by the patient during movement on
[**2200-3-30**].  On [**2200-4-4**], the patient became
acutely short of breath with drop in sense requiring non-
rebreather.  Further decompensation occurred while the
patient was transferred to the CCU and he ultimately required
emergent intubation.  Pre-intubation gas 7.42/41/79.  The
patient's blood pressure decreased following intubation
requiring IV fluids and Neo-Synephrine.  The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for a right main stem bronchus shunt to
hopefully resolve his pleural effusion ex vacuo, which was
thought to be secondary to right lobar collapse secondary to
his obstruction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension, CAD status
post MI in [**2197**], status post LAD stent, catheterization in
[**2194**] showed three-vessel disease with 50 percent narrowing of
the LAD, 30 percent narrowing of the proximal SARC and 60
percent narrowing of the marginal branch.  Echo in [**2198-11-18**], showed an EF of 50 percent, mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]; and a
normal pulmonary artery pressure, history of ventricular
tachycardia status post implantable defibrillator, right
upper lobe mass diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma, no
endobronchial disease on bronchoscopy done at [**Hospital1 336**] (status
post pleuracentesis, fluid was non malignant, MRI revealed
mediastinal involvement, thus the patient was considered non-
resectable; status post 12 radiation treatments in addition
to a course of Paxil and carboplatin), hypercholesterolemia,
and history of atrial fibrillation, taken off Coumadin four
weeks ago.

cutter in the past.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 97.2, blood pressure
72/25 with a CVP of four, and heart rate of 65.  The patient
is on AC with a tidal volume of 600 and respiratory rate of
14, with a PIP of 5, FIO2 of 60 percent, with an O2
saturation of 95 percent.  ABG was 7.43/31/75.  In general,
the patient is intubated, sedated in no apparent distress.
Skin, no rash.  HEENT, pupils are equally round and reactive
to light and accommodation.  Sclerae anicteric.
Cardiovascular, bradycardia with regular rhythm, no murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  Pulmonary, coarse breath sounds on the
left, poor air movement on the right.  Abdomen, normoactive
bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended, no masses or
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities, 1 to 2 plus pitting edema
in the upper extremities, left greater than the right, no
clubbing or cyanosis.  Neurologically, alert, follows
commands, strength 4/4 bilaterally in the upper and lower
extremities, 1 plus reflexes bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA AND DIAGNOSTICS:  White count is 3.9,
hematocrit 32.2, platelets 88 with 86 percent neutrophils, 12
percents lymphocytes, and 2 percent monocytes.  Sodium is
136, potassium 4.5, bicarbonate 20, BUN 59, creatinine 1.7,
and lactate 1.2.  EKG, paced at 66 beats per minute, left
bundle branch block, questionable new T-wave inversion in V5-
V6.  Chest x-ray, right upper lobe collapse, positive
atelectasis/wide-out of the remainder of the right lung.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 75-year-old male with a history
of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, CAD status
post MI and LAD stent, ventricular tachycardia status post
defibrillator, transferred from [**Hospital6 2561**] for
right main stem bronchus stent for obstructing right lung
mass, diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma complicated by an
ex vacuo pleural effusion.

Right lung mass.  The patient presents with a diagnosis of
non-small cell lung cancer identified as stage 3B squamous
carcinoma with mediastinal involvement by MRI with a non-
malignant ex vacuo pleural effusion and associated lung
collapse, status post 12 radiation treatments and a course of
Paxil and carboplatin.  Plan for an initial right main stem
bronchus stent, however, bronchoscopy revealed multiple
endobronchial lesions, thus be more appropriate treatment was
thought to be photodynamic therapy.  The patient was
activated with photodynamic therapy on [**2200-4-10**].  He
required three subsequent bronchoscopies for removal of
debridement from the right main stem bronchus.
Unfortunately, his lung did not re-expand following this
intervention and the patient passed before any significant
recovery could occur.  During his hospital stay, hematology-
oncology was consulted to discuss further management as
daughter looking to shift care to [**Hospital1 18**].  Discussion
initially was made of further chemotherapy.  Radiation
oncology was consulted and felt no further radiation was
indicated as the patient has progressed through 12 treatments
of radiation.  However, the patient, as stated earlier,
passed before recovery from his immediate ailment.

Right pleural effusion ex vacuo.  The patient presented with
a right chest tube in place.  The chest tube remained water
sealed.  Our hope was that this chest tube could be removed
following the re-expansion of his lungs after intervention to
open up his right main stem bronchus.  Unfortunately, his
lung did not re-expand and the chest tube remained in place
at the time of his death.

Respiratory failure.  Due to the patient's obstructing mass
leading to a pleural effusion ex vacuo, the patient suffered
hypoxic respiratory failure.  At the outside hospital, a
chest tube was placed.  It was accidentally dislodged, but
ultimately required replacement as the patient had
respiratory decompensation.  He was transferred, intubated on
assist control.  He was tried on pressor-support during the
course of his ICU stay.  However, he was unable to be weaned
from the ventilator.

Hypotension.  The patient presented with blood pressure of
72/25 with a CVP of four on peripheral Neo-Synephrine.  His
hypotension was initially thought to be due to decreased pre-
loads secondary to increased inter-chest pressures from his
pleural effusion ex vacuo and positive pressure ventilation.
His cortisol was found to be within normal limits.  His blood
pressure did respond to p.r.n. fluid boluses.  He was
maintained on Neo-Synephrine.  During the course of his stay
Vasopressin was added to further support his blood pressures.
The patient's condition began to decompensate.  During this
hospital stay, the patient became septic from likely
pulmonary source and required increasing amounts of pressors
for support.  He ceased to respond to IV fluid boluses and
pressor-support was thought to be maximized.  The patient was
maintained on all these medications till the time of his
death.

Cardiovascular.

Ischemia.  The patient's beta-blocker was held due to his
hypotension. Troponins were slightly elevated at level of
0.05; however, CK MB remained
