CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION: 76 year old man with altered
mental status/delerium
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: ischemic event
CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST: None.
Final Report
HISTORY: 76-year-old male with altered mental status and
delirium concerning for ischemic event.
COMPARISON: MR head from [**2193-7-16**].
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-axial imaging was performed through the brain
without
administration of IV contrast.
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Slight tilting of the patient's head
during imaging
limits evaluation for symmetry somewhat. Allowing for this, no
evidence of
acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass effect,
hydrocephalus, or large
vascular territory infarction is seen. Study is also limited due
to patient motion, particularly the imaging through the skull
base. Again prominence of the sulci and ventricles is consistent
with age-related involutional change.
Periventricular white matter hypodensities are likely due to
chronic small
vessel ischemic disease. Note is also made of likely chronic
small lacunar
infarcts in bilateral basal ganglia. The soft tissues, orbits,
and skull
appear intact. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are
normally aerated. Vascular calcifications are noted along the
cavernous
carotid arteries.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process seen. There is
evidence of chronic microvascular as well as old lacunar
infarction, as on the previous MR. If there is persistent
concern for acute infarction, MRI with diffusion-weighted
imaging would be recommended for more sensitive evaluation.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Aorta - Annulus:  2.4 cm  <= 3.0 cm
Aorta - Sinus Level:  3.4 cm  <= 3.6 cm
Aorta - Sinotubular Ridge:  2.9 cm  <= 3.0 cm
Aorta - Ascending:  *3.5 cm  <= 3.4 cm
Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: PFO is present. Left-to-right
shunt across the interatrial septum at rest.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Overall normal LVEF (>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal descending aorta
diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). Trace
AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
Prebypass
A patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt across
the interatrial septum is seen at rest. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen at a systolic blood pressure of 110
mm Hg.. At a systolic blood pressure of 180 mm Hg and
Trendelenburg position the mitral regurgitation increased to
mild to moderate (2+).
Postbypass.
There is preserved biventricular systolic function. MR is now
trace/mild. The remaining study is unchanged from the prebypass
period.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
