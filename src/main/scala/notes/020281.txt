Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented to the Emergency Department on [**2114-11-3**] with complaints of nausea and vomiting with inability to
tolerate oral intake for 2 days.  She was given intravenous
fluids for hydration and intravenous antiemetics for nausea.
Once stabilized, she was transferred to the general surgical
[**Hospital1 **] for further observation.

On hospital day #1 the patient was without nausea or vomiting,
however, an abdominal/ pelvic CTA scan was obtained to evaluate
for an anastamotic stricture and bowel ischemia due to low serum
bicarbonate on laboratory data.  The CTA results were negative
for an intra-abdominal process, however, there was an incidental
finding of a right lower lobe pulmonary embolism.  The patient
was subsequently transferred to the medical intensive care unit
for initiation of a heparin gtt with close monitoring.
Additionally, lower extremity non-invasive studies were
performed to evaluate for the presence of a deep vein
thrombosis, of which there were none.  Hematology was consulted
regarding anticoagulation in this patient with recommnendations
for bridging the patient to coumadin therapy with heparin or
enoxaparin.

On hospital day #3, the patient continued on the heparin gtt
which was titrated based upon the results of PTT results which
were obtained every six hours.  Also, as she remained stable
without signs or symptoms of respiratory distress, she was
transferred to back to the general surgical [**Hospital1 **].

On hospital day #4, the diet was advanced to stage 4, which the
patient tolerated well.  The heparin gtt was discontinued and
the decision was made to begin a 3-month course of lovenox
therapy given the unknown effect of gastric bypass surgery on
coumadin absorption.  The patient was taught to self-administer
the lovenox medication and was also taught to report any head
injuries or signs of uncontrolled bleeding by the nursing staff
prior to discharge.

At the time of discharge on hospital day #5, the patient was
doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs.  The patient was
tolerating a Stage 4 diet, ambulating, voiding independently,
and without pain.  She will follow-up in one month, but will
report any return of nausea and vomiting for which she would
require and esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up
instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with
the discharge plan.
