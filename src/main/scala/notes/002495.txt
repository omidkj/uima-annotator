Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2817**]
Chief Complaint:
Admit to MICU for Resp distress, Dyspnea and HCT of 11

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1)Intubation ([**9-20**])
2)Right IJ central line (placed [**9-20**], removed [**9-21**] for HD catheter
placement)
3)Double-lumen hemodialysis catheter (placed [**9-20**])


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 25yo male who presented with ARF and HCT 11 from
OSH; pt has baseline muscular dystrophy and renal disease of
unclear etiology, non-hemorrhagic anemia in [**2-/2105**] (s/p
transfusion of 4 units pRBC) with poor follow-up.  For the past
week, the patient's per oral intake decreased secondary to new
dysphagia, fatigue increased, and pt began gagging w/ nausea and
emesis.  The patient has chronic watery nonbloody diarrhea.
Notably he had worsening dyspnea today.  He lives with an aide
who stopped his medications a week ago (toprol, paxil, norvasc)
because they "make his stomach sick."
The patient was brought to OSH in respiratory distress, at
[**Location (un) **], he was found to have HCT 11, creatinine 12.1, HCO3 6.
His ABG 7.03/ 13/157.  He was intubated for severe respiratory
distress, his bicarbonate stabilized, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
via [**Location (un) 7622**] for further workup and care, including a for
presumed GI bleed.
In ED, nasogastric lavage was negative and stool was guaiac
negative X1, slightly positive the second time.  CT of the
abdomen and chest radiograph were unrevealing.  He was also
thrombocytopenic on admission.  Renal was consulted in ED,
bicarbonate deficit was 400 mEq and he received 150 mEq in ED.
Renal recs ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 73499**]): monitor potassium during bicarbonate
infusion, check lytes q2h during bicarb infusion, and replete
with 20 mEq potassium. [**4-19**] g CaGluc was provided for
transfusions.  Renal U/S and spot urine prot/cr ratio were
performed.
When he was admitted to the ICU at [**Hospital1 18**] he had a Hgb of 5.1,
WBC
of 6.8 (83% neutrophils, no bands), Plt of 90, BUN/Cr of
202/12.6, bicarb of 6, glucose of 160, and anion gap of 37.
Upon arrival at the MICU, the patient was given 3 amps
bicarbonate in 1L D5W between units of blood.  The patient was
hyperventilated to blow off CO2.
Of note, the patient had an admission beginning on [**2105-2-16**] at an
outside hospital for a very similar clinical picture: metabolic
acidosis, acute renal failure, and anemia.  On admission at that
time, his hemoglobin and hematocrit were 7.5 and 22.  He
received 2 units of PRBCs which increased his counts to
10.5/31.7 on [**2105-2-23**].   He did not receive close follow-up in the
interval to the present day.

Past Medical History:
1)Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, diagnosed at age 5, (baseline
in wheelchair)
2)Admission to [**Location (un) **] in [**2-/2105**] for ARF and metabolic acidosis
3)Hypertension
4)Chronic kidney disease, ?IgA nephropathy (hx of kidney bx,
results unknown)
5)History of proteinuria
6)Chronic diarrhea (work-up in [**2-/2105**] unrevealing, results of
endoscopic biopsies unknown at this time)
7)Anemia

-Mother, and both siblings have facioscapulohumeral dystrophy
(autosomal dominant inheritance)
-No known history of cancer
-No known history of bleeding or clotting disorders

Relevant Imaging:
[**2105-9-20**] CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: 1.  Limited study due
to lack of intravenous or oral contrast.  No radiographic
findings to explain the patient's drop in hematocrit.  No
evidence for intraperitoneal hematoma.
2.  Atrophic kidneys and trace ascites. 3. Marked lumbar
scoliosis.
4.  Nodular opacities at the lung bases may represent evolving
infectious etiology.  Recommend follow up imaging to ensure
resolution after appropriate treatment.

[**2105-9-20**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Cannot rule out old anterolateral
myocardial infarction.  Modest lateral ST-T wave changes which
are non-specific. No previous tracing available for comparison.
