Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Chest Tube Placement complicated by subcutaneous emphysema
Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Briefly, 69 yo M with severe COPD on home O2 who orginally c/p
SOB x 24hrs in addition to L sided chest pain. He used nebs
without relief, did have a productive cough and was hypertensive
to 190s. EMS was called, and vitals on arrival were the
following: 190/90, HR 120, RR 24, O2 sat 90% with unclear amt of
oxygen.
.
At the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, his vitals were T99.0, P 136, BP 214/126, RR
35, and O2 sat 89% on unclr amt of O2. NIPV was tried, but did
not relieve resp distress. CXR showed L sided PTX. CT was placed
by ED, then was c/b kinking and SQ emphysema, the pt developed
extensive subcutaneous air over his chest, neck, and down into
his scrotum. He c/o increasing shortness of [**Last Name (LF) 1440**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] the
decision was made to intubate him. Intubation was difficult and
c/b hypotension with sedation. IP replaced chest tube. The
patient was intubated and sedated and xferred to MICU For futher
care.
.
MICU course:
A line was placed. CT to suction was initiated, but IP not
following. Patient quickly weaned off the vent with tx for COPD
exacerbation and was extubated. He was maintained on steroids.
Hypotension resolved. L sided chest pain was controlled with
lidocaine patches and fentanyl. Original PTX thought to be due
to ruptured bleb due to patient's COPD. The patient maintained
Sats in the 90s on 6L nasal cannula. He maintained to have a
small amount of hemoptysis that was attributed to traumatic
intubation. Abx were continued empirically as well as
theophylline and inhalers as part of tx for COPD exacerbation.
Chest tube leaked persisted and there was a concern raised for
bronchopleural fistula

Pertinent Results:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
The left chest tube has been repositioned and is now in the left
upper chest. The left lung appears better aerated and expanded.
An endotracheal tube is in place, approximately 7.5 cm above the
carina.
The endotracheal tube balloon cuff is overdistended, and should
be deflated slightly.
A massive amount of subcutaneous emphysema now covers both sides
of the chest wall and the neck, obscuring evaluation of the
underlying lung fields. Mediastinal air is also present.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2152-5-9**] 4:19 PM
INDICATION: Chest tube removal after pneumothorax.

CHEST, ONE VIEW: Comparison with [**2152-5-8**]. Left chest tube
has been removed. No residual pneumothorax is seen. Volume loss
on the left is slightly less in degree than the previous exam;
there is residual opacity over the left mid lung and left lower
lobe, which can represent consolidation, atelectasis, or
asymmetric edema. Right lung appears relatively clear, though
right lung basilar opacity is unchanged. Bilateral subcutaneous
emphysema is still present.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year old gentleman with severe COPD who
presented with acute respiratory distress who was found to have
a large left sided pneumothorax. Chest tube was placed in the ED
complicated by subcutaneous empysema. He was intubated and later
extubated on [**2152-5-4**].  After transfer to the floor the patient
steadily improved, chest tube was removed without complication,
pt had significant hemoptysis and underwent bronchoscopy for
suctioning and diagnostic purposes, revealing bronchomalacea. Pt
should have an interval noncontrast chest CT for further eval as
an outpatient.

1) Respiratory failure:
Likely secondary to pneumothorax from ruptured bleb. Following
extubation the patient was quickly weaned to 6L by nasal
cannula, then 2-3L as his baseline O2 requirement. He was
treated empirically with cefpodoxime/azithromycin for 7 and 5
days respectively. Given IV solumedrol and later changed to
prednisone taper. Pt's subcutaneous emphysema steadily improved
over the course of the admission.
He will-follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Known firstname **] in Pulmonary. Sutures
from the patients chest tube site should be removed in 10 days
following discharge on [**2152-5-11**].

2) Pneumothorax:
Likely secondary to ruptured bleb, complicated by chest tube
placement and subcutaneous emphysema (large amount). Chest to
suction during initial air leak, later resolved. Tube was
removed by interventional pulmonary [**2152-5-9**] without event.
Interval chest xray revealed resolution of pnemothrax with
persistent LLL collapse and volume loss. Pt went for
bronchoscopy as below for deep suction and diagnostic purposes.

3) hemoptysis:
likely secondary to intubation trauma vs multiple rupture blebs
in COPD. He has not had this prior to admission. Bronchoscopy
during this admission revealed bronchomalacia, follow up
noncontrast Chest CT should be performed in [**1-8**] weeks for
further elucidation of pt's lung disease.
.
4) tachycardia-
appearance of MAT by EKG. pt was stared on low dose diltiazem
for rate control. He may be weaned of this medication as an
outpatient beyond the acute phase of his illness.
.
5) Cardiovascular-
Tachycardia as above. Lasix was held in the setting of transient
rise in Creatinine clearance. He did not require re-introduction
of lasix during this admission. Close follow up as an outpatient
may require re-initiation of this medication. Aspirin therapy
was held in the setting of hemoptysis. Atorvastatin was
continued.

6) GERD-
Continued home dosing of protonix while inpatient.
