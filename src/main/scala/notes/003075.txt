CT Head:
IMPRESSION:

1. Right temporal intraparenchymal hematoma compatible with a
contracoup
hemorrhagic contusion, with adjacent subarachnoid hemorrhage and
a 4-mm right frontotemporal subdural hemorrhage. 4-mm of right
to left midline shift.

2. Left parietotemporal scalp hematoma.

3. Air-fluid level in the left sphenoid sinus suggestive of
acute sinusitis.

These findings were communicated to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2190-9-21**] at the
time of study acquisition.


CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of solid organ injury within the chest, abdomen,
or pelvis.

2. Comminuted fracture of the distal left clavicle. AC joint is
intact.

3. Questionable left scapular fracture.

4. Acute fractures of ribs 1 and 6 posteriorly on the left with
a contour
deformity of the right fifth lateral rib fracture, suspicious
for acute
fracture.

5. Comminuted fracture of the left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] and non-displaced
fractures of the superior and inferior left pubic rami with a
large left gluteus maximus intramuscular hematoma.

6. Compression fracture involving the T11 vertebral body with 25
to 50% loss of height and 5 mm of retropulsion with indentation
of the ventral thecal sac.


7. Anterior wedge compression fracture of the T7 vertebral body
with less
than 25% loss of height, of indeterminant age.

8. An 8 mm of anterolisthesis of L4 on L5 of indeterminate
chronicity. This may be further evaluated with MRI.

9. Fibroid uterus.

10. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.

11. Mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation s/p cholecystectomy.
Clinical
correlation recommended, and an MRCP can be obtained for further
evalaution.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 1093**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Probable acute compression fracture of the superior endplate
of the T4
vertebral body without retropulsion of fracture fragments.

2. Non-recent compression fractures of the T7 and T11 vertebral
bodies with slight retropulsion of fracture fragments at T7 and
more severe retropulsion of fracture fragments at T11 completely
effacing the thecal sac at this level without significant spinal
canal stenosis. The spinal cord remains unremarkable.

3. Advanced multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine
as described above, with spinal canal stenosis at L3-4 and L4-5
secondary to multifactorial
degenerative changes.







Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma service. Neurosurgery, Spine and
Orthopedics were consulted. Her injuries were managed non
operatively. She was loaded with Dilantin and admitted to Trauma
ICU for close monitoring. Serial head CT scans were followed and
remained stable. Her ASA is being withheld for at least 1 week;
Heparin SQ was started on HD# 4. Dilantin will continue for 10
days and she will follow up in 4 weeks with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for
repeat head CT scan.

Her spine fractures were determined to be chronic and she will
follow up in spine clinic several weeks after discharge.

Her clavicle and pelvic fractures did not require any surgery.
She is to wear a sling for comfort and may partial weight bear
on her LLE. She will follow up in [**3-10**] weeks in [**Hospital 5498**]
clinic.

She was evaluated by Physical therapy and is being recommended
for rehab after his acute hospital stay.
