She was given abx, steroids, nebs, and lasix 20 mg IV (CXR c/w
volume overload, BNP elevated, and EKG showed afib with rate
128, ST depr V3-6, II, F -- change from baseline). She improved
with the lasix (also radiographic improvement). Her SBP was
transiently in the 90s but quickly improved. She was admitted to

.
CXR: Improving pulmonary edema with a decrease in the size of
the now tiny bilateral pleural effusions. Multiple chronic
compression deformities of the thoracic vertebral bodies.
.
pCXR: Mild pulmonary edema has improved since [**4-9**]. Top
normal heart size is stable. Pleural effusion has decreased or
resolved. No pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. SOB: On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], had signs of volume overload on
CXR (and elevated BNP). Oxygenation much improved after
diuresis. In the ED, she also got steroids/nebs and abx for
?bronchitis. History seems more consistent with flash pulmonary
edema, in the setting of afib with RVR. She may have bronchitis
(no definite inflitrate on CXR) that could have been the
inciting event for afib. Doubt cardiac etiology/ischemia. Ruled
out for MI. Rate controlled with verapamil and amiodarone.
Follow up with cardiologist.
.
2. Afib with RVR: Controlled with verapamil and amio. Cont.
coumadin. Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
3. CHF: preserved EF but severe MR (so likely overestimated EF).
Not usually on lasix, so it is likely in setting of afib/rvr.
Diuresed gently with 20 mg po lasix, to complete a week of this
at rehab. Started low dose ACEI.
.
4. Anemia: hct at baseline, slightly lower today but has been
this low in the past. Guaiac stools.
.
5. CRI: At baseline 1.5-1.7.
.
