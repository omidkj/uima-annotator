History of Present Illness:
History obtained from granddaughter and available medical
records.
[**Age over 90 **]M [**Hospital3 **] resident with DM, multiple recent admissions
to [**Hospital1 112**] (apparently s/p falls, UTI) who was just d/ced from [**Hospital1 112**]
2d PTA (reportedly after he refused to go to rehab/NH) who was
send to [**Hospital1 18**] with "failure to thrive" after being found
lethargic, weak, and confused in his apt by visiting 'Elder
services' so EMS was called & brought pt to ED ([**Hospital1 112**] on divert).

.
Pt reportedly found sleeping on the (carpeted) floor of his apt
yesterday but w/o obvious signs of a fall.
.
Pt denies pain but is otherwise unable to give any history. [**Name (NI) 1094**]
granddaughter spend much of yesterday w/the pt & states that he
did not have any complaints at that time. Pt has apparently had
very limited mobility since d/c from [**Hospital1 112**] due to weakness.
.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt's SBP was initially stable in 128/52 but after a few
hours, BP was noted to be 66/43 so pt started on dopa and
L-subclav placed. Pt rec'd ASA 600 PR, ceftriaxone 1g, flagyl
500, and hydrocort 100. Pt's BP improved with 3L NS and dopa was
weaned to lowest dose upon transfer to MICU.



Past Medical History:
hypothyroidism
dementia
prolactinoma
diabetes
s/p multiple falls

Social History:
lives at [**Hospital3 **]. Per pt's granddaughter, the pt's
primary caregiver has been the pt's daughter x many years but
this daughter recently had an MI and stroke so is at a rehab
facility.

non- contributory

erythematous rash in anterior chest

.
head CT: large sellar mass- no intercranial hemorrhage or
infarct
.
. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include severe
hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferolateral wall.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic function appears depressed with marked hypokinesis of
the RV apex.
4.The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
5. The aortic valve is midly thickened tricuspid valve. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
7.Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
8.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR: : Left lower lobe consolidation concerning for pneumonia.
Atelectasis is a less likely possibility.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]M with DM, dementia, and apparently several recent admission
to [**Hospital1 112**] for falls, UTI, FTT, now BIBA after being found
lethargic, weak, & confused. In ED found to have likely PNA,
became transiently hypotensive, stabilized after IVF.  Patient
intially admitted to MICU.  Thought to have early sepsis (e.g.,
from PNA), vs. mucus plug. Doubt that he had large AMI leading
to cardiogenic shock given physical exam and flat CKs, although
patient did have troponin elevation.  This was thought to be
from either a cardiac event or from sepsis in setting of ARF.
He was continued on antibiotics (Vanc and Zosyn).  A head CT in
the ED was negative for a bleed but notable for large sellar
mass (which per daughter is known & old). Old records were
reviewed, and it was found that patient has known prolactinoma
invading his sella space and rendering him panhypopit.  The
patient most recently seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 66572**], also Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4887**];
has also been seen at [**Hospital1 112**] Brain Tumor Center.  Apparently not a
surgical candidate, currently on Dostinex for the tumor.
Endocrine was consulted, and recommended stress dose steroids
with taper.  He was continued on hydrocort IV and then
eventually transistioned to oral prednisone, 5mg, daily, which
he will remain on indefinitely.  His temperature also decreased
overnight on two occasions to 92-93 degrees.  He remained
hemodynamically stable with no other suggestions of sepsis or
infections.  This temperature decrease was thought to be
possibly related to his hypothyroidism or hypopituitarism from
the prolactinoma, no clear etiology was found.
After four day stay in the ICU, the patient was transferred to a
medicine floor.  He was continued on antibiotics for pneumonia,
completed a week course of Zosyn; then given oral Levaquin to
complete three more days for total ten day course of treatment.
His Levaquin was discontinued one day early for concern of
prolonged QT interval seen on EKG.  He was weaned off oxygen and
his blood pressured stabilized despite discontinuation of
midodrine.  It was thought that given his cardiac function (an
echo done on [**3-1**] showed depressed LV and RV function,
hypokinesis) he could benefit from initiation of either a
beta-blocker or ACE, however given his tenuous blood pressure,
this was deferred for now.  His creatinine continued to improved
to .8 from 1.6 at admission.   He was restarted on Zyprexa 2.5mg
[**Hospital1 **], which he had been on according to his most recent discharge
summary from [**Hospital1 112**].  PT evaluated the patient and recommended
further treatment at a rehab facility.  This was discussed with
the patient and his family.
He diabetes was relatively well controlled with 14 units of
Lantus daily and a Humalog sliding scale.  This was decreased to
5 units of Lantus as his blood sugars were much lower once the
high dose steroids were stopped.  It is recommended that if his
blood sugars increased, wait at least 48 hours before further
increasing his Lantus dose to avoid precipitating hypoglycemia.
He was continued on his home dose of Levoxyl.  It is recommended
that he follow-up at the [**Hospital **] clinic after his stay at rehab.
On the day prior to discharge, he became acutely hypoxic down to
oxygen saturation of 88% on RA.  CXR and physical exam most
suggestive of fluid overload and the patient had received IVF
the day prior for lyte replacement and hypernatremia.  He
responded well to IV lasix, with oxygen saturation improving to
96%.
He was maintained on sc heparin for DVT prophylaxis and
tolerated a diabetic/low sodium diet well with aspiration
precautions.
