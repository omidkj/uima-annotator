122/84.  Respiratory rate 28.  O2 sat 100% on nonrebreather.
The patient was alert and oriented times three with no
respiratory distress on nonrebreather mask.  Pupils are
equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles are
intact.  There is slightly dry oral mucosa.  Neck was supple,

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 6.9, hematocrit 31.7,
platelets 322, sodium 137, potassium 4.8, chloride 97, bicarb
32, BUN 55, creatinine 2.7 and glucose 116.  Calcium 9.4,
magnesium 5.1, phos 2.9.  Arterial blood gas on 100%
nonrebreather 7.35, PCO2 67, PO2 108, lactate 0.73, troponin
1.1, CK 27.  Urinalysis 6 to 10 red blood cells, 11 to 20
white blood cells, rare bacteria.  No nitrates.  Chest x-ray
revealed bilateral pleural effusions, question pneumonia,
increased heart size, left pleural effusion markedly larger
with a midline shift.  Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm
at 90, short RR interval .1 milliseconds.  Other RR normal.
Poor R wave progression.  Q wave in leads 3 and F.  In
comparison to an [**9-1**], electrocardiogram lateral and
inferior ST T changes were improved.  No significant ST
changes.  CT scan of the chest revealed moderate to large
left pleural effusion that was dependent.  A small
circumferential pleural thickening, cardiac enlargement
consistent with edema, multi focal lung opacities in the
lower lung zones likely atelectasis.  Bilateral adrenal
masses and left renal atrophy.
