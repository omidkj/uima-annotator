Chief Complaint:
BRBPR

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
79F with PMH of afib on coumadin, HTN, DM2, CAD, CHF, previous
MCA stroke, and hemorrhoids, who presents with BRBPR of one day
duration. Patient first noted blood-streaked stool after a large
bowel movement this morning.  The patient has a hx of
hemorrhoids and noted that her stool this morning was very hard
,as she had been constipated for the past week. Patient denies
chronic constipation; although she does take oxycodone/oxycontin
for claudication pain, she is also on standing docusate. With
her bleed this morning, she had no abdominal pain,
lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea or vomiting. No chest pain or
shortness of breath.  Her daughter did notice a small, slow
trickle of blood from her rectum after the bowel movement.
Later in the day, patient showed up for episodic visit to
[**First Name3 (LF) 1106**] surgery and was noted to have blood stains on her pants
but no acute bleeding.  She was referred to a covering PCP at
[**Name9 (PRE) 191**] for evaluation, where she was found to have large amounts of
bright red blood in her diaper and continued to bleed from her
rectum.  She continued to deny dizziness, confusion, abdominal
pain, nausea/vomiting.  She was referred to the ED.

Of note, patient denies any hx of black stools or bleeding with
wiping.  Her last colonoscopy was in [**2187-12-7**], and was
significant for diverticulosis of the entire colon with moderate
to large openings.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.3 HR 52 BP 132/72 RR 16 O2 Sat
100% RA. Exam revealed a small, non-bleeding rectal hemorrhoid
and a trickle of blood from the rectum. Her Hct of 33.5 which
appears to be her baseline, and her INR was 2.7.  She was also
noted to have BUN 56 with Cr 1.3.  She has a hx of difficult IV
access, and after multiple attempts, only has a single 20G PIV.
She was transferred to the ICU for further management.

Colonoscopy ([**2189-7-24**]):
Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential
complications were explained to the patient, who indicated her
understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. The
efficiency of a colonoscopy in detecting lesions was discussed
with the patient and it was pointed out that a small percentage
of polyps and other lesions can be missed with the test. A
physical exam was performed. The patient was administered MAC
anesthesia. The physical exam was performed prior to
administering anesthesia. Supplemental oxygen was used. The
patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position.The
digital exam was normal. The colonoscope was introduced through
the rectum and advanced under direct visualization until the
cecum was reached. The appendiceal orifice and ileo-cecal valve
were identified. Careful visualization of the colon was
performed as the colonoscope was withdrawn. The colonoscope was
retroflexed within the rectum. The procedure was not difficult.
The quality of the preparation was good. The patient tolerated
the procedure well. There were no complications.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 y/o with extensive cardiovasular and peripheral [**Month/Day/Year 1106**]
disease, A-fib on coumadin, and external hemorrhoids, initially
admitted to the medical ICUwith BRBPR and persistent trickling
of blood and blood clots from rectum.
.
# GI Bleed: On admission, the patient had slow active GIB with
bright red blood and clots at the rectum.  She was on coumadin
with therapeutic INR.  She has a history of external hemmorhoid,
but on exam this was not the source of bleeding.  She received 1
unit of PRBCs on [**7-17**] in response to a Hct drop from 33.5
to 24.0.  She responded well with a stable Hct in the 29s.  A
previous colonoscopy done in [**2187-12-7**] showed diverticulosis
throughout the entire colon, which was not known to have bled
previously.  Gastroenterology was consulted and was concerned
that a colonoscopy would be unrevealing of a different source
and could be traumatic.  As her bleeding stopped and her Hct was
stable, they decided not to pursue the study initially.  She was
transferred out of the ICU to the floor for further management.
On the medical floor, she was started on a heparin drip for
anticoagulation as well as coumadin.  She initially did well.
However on [**2189-7-21**], she had recurrent rectal bleeding.  The
heparin drip was stopped as
