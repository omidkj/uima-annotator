Brief Hospital Course:
Taken to OR on [**2140-12-5**], underwent CABG X 3 (LIMA>LAD, SVG>OM,
SVG>Ramus), post-op came off CPB on milrinone, epinephrine,
levophed, and IABP.  She remained sedated, on the ventilator,
pressors, and inotropes, for the first few post-op days.  She
had frequent ventricular tachycardia requiring emergent
cardioversion.  Her IABP was weaned and removed on post-op
day#2, but she had recurrent ventricular tachycardia with some
low cardiac output and hypotensive episodes.
She was taken to the cath lab on post-op day #4, where her LIMA
graft was found to be occluded, 2 stents were placed (mid, and
ostial LAD).  IABP was placed, and she returned to the ICU.  She
was then taken to the electrophysiology lab for temporary
coronary sinus pacer lead placement, and again returned to the
ICU.
She remained sedated, on the ventilator, with IABP in place over
the next few days, and improved hemodynamically.
IABP was subsequently removed on [**12-12**] (POD # 7), and she was
taken to the EP lab for removal of her temporary pacing leads,
and placement of an AICD/DDD pacer.
She was weaned from the ventilator, and extubated the following
morning.
She was weaned from her vasoactive gtts over the next 24 hours.
She was transferred from the ICU to the telemetry floor on [**12-15**]
(POD # 10), and she began physical therapy and cardiac rehab.
She was started on Captopril, but developed a dry cough.  This
was switched to lisinopril on [**12-22**].
WBC up to 19K (on [**12-21**]), afebrile, + u/a, started on
levofloxacin, cultures pending.
also w/erythematous rt. groin incision (no drainage).
Echo [**12-22**] revealed:significantly improved EF of 50%.  INR 1.5,
[**12-22**], heparin gtt d/c'd.
Patient was being screened for rehab when between [**12-22**] and [**12-26**]
she complained of SOB and dry cough.  With lungs ranging from
clear to rales throughout.  She was treated with diuresis,
aggressive chest PT, and neb treatments.  On [**12-27**] she was started
on a natracor drip fro diuresis with continued SOB and LE edema.
 CXR showed worsening of dissuse interstitial disease.  WBC
continued to climb to 22K on [**12-28**].  She was started on Zosyn on
[**12-24**], cipro on [**12-25**], and vanco [**12-28**] for suspected pneumonia.
ON [**12-29**] (POD 29), Mrs. [**Known lastname 59441**] was transferred back to the
intensive care unit for ongoing SOB and decreased oxygen
saturation with need for bipap in ICU.  Infectious disease and
interventional pumonary consults were obtained.  A diagnosis of
acute amiodarone toxicity and respiratory failure were
ultimately made.  Amiodarone was discontinued and patient was
continued on bipap.  (She was started on dilt instead.)  All of
the antibiotics were ultimately discontinued (by 1/13 per the
recommendation of the ID service) and she was also started on
steroids per ID on [**1-3**].  She rapidly improved and her oxygen
requirement quickly decreased.
On [**1-4**] (POD 30), Mrs. [**Known lastname 59441**] was weened from the face mask
for oxygen and was transferred back to the floor.
She had been restarted on coumadin with an INR of about 2 and it
was noticed on [**1-6**] that she had a drop in her HCT and dark
stools.  She was transfused 2units of PRBC, the coumadin was
discontinued and her HCT has remained stable since.  The
decision was made at this time that she receive no further
anticoagulation.
She was screened for rehab facilities and is awating discharge.
