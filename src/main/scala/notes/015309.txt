Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
coffee ground emesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD

History of Present Illness:
This is a 60 y/o AAM w/ h/o CAD, active cocaine abuse, prior
[**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear and chronic hiccups who is transferred from
the MICU following an espisode of coffee ground emesis with
noted esophogeal blood clot, now HD stable.
*
He originally presented [**12-9**] with coffeeground emesis. He last
used cocaine 4 days PTA, noting worsening hiccups, induced
vomiting with coffee ground emesis associated with nausea,
subxiphoid abdominal pain, and chills. In ED >500 cc coffee
ground emesis, sbp transiently decreased to 90 with improvement
with 250 cc NS bolus. He received [**Last Name (LF) 28920**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], Protonix, KCl, 2
L NS, and dilaudid and a RIJ was placed. He refused NG lavage.
Of note, cards saw pt given new RBBB, who recommended no acute
intervention at this time. Pt was admitted to ICU for
monitoring. Shortly after arriving to ICU, he underwent an EGD,
which noted a large clot in middle third of esophagus and lower
third of the esophagus with clotted blood and coffee grounds (1L
removed) and small amounts of fresh blood. The EGD was aborted
when he became hypotensive w/ MAP ~ 40. He was intubated for
airway protection, with approximately 1L bloody emesis suctioned
after intubation. A right femoral a-line and left femoral cordis
were placed. He received 3 LNS and 3 u PRBC as well as
neosynephrine gtt w/ improvement in MAPs to 70. A repeat EGD
showed clotted blood in the middle [**11-22**] of the esophagus with
associated oozing. Epinephrine was injected under the clot and
the clot was removed. However, no underlying lesion was
visualized that could account for the bleeding. He subsequently
remained hemodynamically stable with stable hematocrit over the
next 24 hours. He was transferred to the medicine service for
continued medical management.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 y/o M with h/o cocaine abuse, intractable hiccups, CAD, who
presents with coffee ground emesis and esophogeal clot

1) UGI bleed: Thought most likely secondary to [**Doctor First Name 329**]-[**Doctor Last Name **]
tear, although no tear directly visualized by EGD. EGD was
significant for blood clot with oozing, as described in the HPI.
The clot was removed and he was stabilized in the MICU
overnight. Following clot removal he remained hemodynamically
stable without evidence of bleed. Hematocrit remained stable at
31-32 over the next 24 hours. He was transferred to the medicine
service where he had no further evidence of GI bleed. Hematocrit
remained stable without requirement of further blood tranfusion.
He will have repeat EGD in 2 weeks with gastroenterology.

2) Hypotension: Developed transient systolic blood pressures in
the 90's in the ED, likely representing hypovolemia in setting
of large volume GI bleed. During EGD, his MAP fell to the 40's
as outlined in the HPI. He was initially treated with IVF and
pressor support in addition to 4 units of PRBCs. Following
hemostasis, he was able to be weaned off pressors while
maintaining stable blood pressures. Initially,  infection was
considered as a potential etiology. Given his leukocytosis and
risk for aspiration he was started empirically on levo/flagyl
for aspiration pneumonia. However, this was subsequently
discontinued prior to transfer to the medicine service since he
had no evidence of pneumonia by CXR. Blood cultures and Urine
cultures were negative.

3) RBBB: Seen on EKG in the ED, which was new since his NSTEMI
at OSH, but he was noted to have previous evidence of RBBB in
the setting of tachycardia. He was evaluated by cardiology who
felt no acute interventio was indicated. He subsequently ruled
out for acute ischemic event with 3 sets of negative cardiac
enzymes.

4) Hypertension: Once his blood pressure normalized, he was
re-started on his outpatient regimen of lisinopril, HCTZ and
triamterene. Toprol XL was held due to his ongoing cocaine
abuse. His blood pressures on this regimen were 100-110
systolic. Given his pre-load dependence in the setting of his
moderate aortic stenosis, in addition to his history of gout,
the HCTZ and triamterene were discontinued prior to discharge.
In addition, lisinopril was decreased to 40mg qday ([**11-21**] his
previous dose).

5) Right lower lobe pneumonia: The patient developed a new
leukocytosis, fever (101.8) and mild hypoxia (02 sat at 93%) on
[**2100-12-14**]. Initial portable CXR showed no evidence of pneumonia
and the patient defervesced the following morning. Antibiotics
were initially held, however repeat CXR PA&Lat showed evidence
of right lower lobe pneumonia. Therefore he was started on a 7
day course of levofloxacin. He continued to appear well without
fever and his WBC cou
