Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none in [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]

History of Present Illness:
[**Hospital Unit Name 92800**]:
86F with CAD s/p CABG, AS s/p valvuloplasty [**11-3**], diastolic
CHF, AF who is POD 3 s/p R hemicolectomy for adenocarcinoma
sessile polyp seen on colonoscopy. Her post op course was
notable for re-intubation in the TICU on [**12-8**] and extubation on
[**12-9**].  She has been hypercarbic over the last few days (50s-60s
since extubation) with minimal urine output (15-20 cc/hr), which
was treated with fluid bolus.  Her O2 sats have been ok during
this time.
.
She is one month s/p valvuloplasty for critical AS
(valvuloplasty increased her aortic valve from 0.5cm2 to
1.0cm2). Shortly following the valvuloplasty, pt developed GI
bleed and had a EGD/colonoscopy, which revealed the large cecal
mass.

TEE ([**2195-12-8**]):Initial exam:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage.
There is mild global biventricular hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
By the end of the procedure there had been no significant
changes
.
Chest X-Ray ([**2195-12-13**]):FINDINGS: In comparison with study of
[**12-12**], there is again substantial cardiomegaly with some [**Month/Year (2) 1106**]
congestion and bibasilar atelectasis. The small-to-moderate
bilateral pleural effusions are again appreciated. Broken
sternal wires are again seen.
.
[**2195-12-8**] Colon mass:
Adenocarcinoma, 3.0 cm; see synoptic report.

Brief Hospital Course:
Initial Surgical Course: Admitted to TICU for pre-op bowel prep.
Required ICU monitoring due to extensive cardiac disease. Pre-op
admission coordinated with patient's cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Patient's operative course uncomplicated. Extubated in OR,
reintubated in TICU, now on PSV. Admitted to TICU for continued
monitoring. [**12-9**]-extubated. Early in day, pt had some
hypercarbia that improved modestly. Urine output trended down.
Given lasix 40mg IV x 2, and bolused conservatively. Responded
appropriately. Bowel function resumed. Diet advanced slowly.
Tolerating a regular diet and oral medications. Respiratory
status stable. Patient transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 1950**] 5 on [**Hospital Ward Name 516**]
however continued to have persistent hypercarbia, and
somnolence. Creatinine continued to rise. Transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for closer respiratory monitoring, and hemodynamic monitoring.
She was then tranferred to Cardiology service on [**Wardname 13764**].
.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course: Patient was transferred for further management of
hypercapnia and her volume status.  She was seen by cardiology
in consultation who felt that she needed gentle diuresis, and
that when she was ready to leave the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] should be transferred
to the cardiology service for further management of her volume
status.
#. hypervolemia: patient has known dCHF and systolic dysfuction
with EF 45-50%.  In addition, she still has AS with valve area
about 0.8.  With fluid boluses for low UOP, strongly suspect
cardiogenic edema and hypervolemia.  CXR shows consistent
pulmonary edema.  Crackles and JVD on exam. Received 60 then 40
IV Lasix with good UOP.
.
#. low UOP/ARF: Cr up to 1.3.  UOP low for past couple days.
likely from poor forward cardiac flow and prerenal physiology.
.
#. hypercapnea:   Thought to be due to increased work of
breathing from CHF from her AS and diastolic CHF, Patient likely
had mild CO2 retention at baseline as reflected in elevated
bicarb on prior labs, acute worsening may have occurred in
setting of peri-op sedatives/pain meds, atelectasis and volume
overload. ABGs have been stable throughout course and there was
no acute worsening to precipitate ICU transfer, upon arrival to
ICU, patient??????s mental status was at her baseline.
.
#. AS: recently underwent valvuloplasty, still with valve area
of 0.8cm2.
.
#. atrial fibrillation: rate controlled on metoprolol.
.
Cardiology Course:  Patient was transferred to the cardiology
service on [**2195-12-12**] for further management of her
