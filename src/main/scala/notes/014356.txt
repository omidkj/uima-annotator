History of Present Illness:
27year old male with Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] Syndrome, (bone disorder) with
restrictive lung disease from severe scoliosis and COPD (current
smoker) at home on 4L O2 by nasal cannula and then SIMV by
ventilator at night presenting to ED with increased SOB x 2days
and increasing secretions. Patient was recently admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] with right olecranon osteomyelitis. He has been treated
for 1.5 weeks with vancomycin for this infection. Since then he
reports very little improvement in the infection.
 Patient has history of ventilator-associated pneumonia with
resistant pseudomonas in recent cultures (sensitive only to
tobramycin but treated with cefepime with good result) and
reports that over the last few days he has had increasing SOB
worse than baseline. In addition he has had increasing
secretions. He thinks he may also have been having fevers
(low-grade). No sick contacts but says this feels like his prior
PNAs so he came to ED.
.
 VS on arrival to the ED: T:98.9 HR:122 BP:109/79 RR:22 O2Sat:98
on 5L trach mask.  Reportedly received cefepime and/or levoquin
in the ED  for history of pseudomonal VAP since already on
Vancomycin for osteomyelitis was covered for MRSA. Also takes
prednisone at home and got 60mg in the ED for ?COPD
exacerbation.
.
VS prior to transfer: T 99 HR 108 BP 124/72 RR 20 O2 97% on 5L
trach mask.
.
On the floor,  patient complained of SOB and requested nebulizer
treatments. He denied chest pain, dysuria, N/V/abdominal
pain/diarrhea.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Respiratory distress/SOB: Afebrile, no leukocytosis and no
evidence of pneumonia on chest xray (although exam difficult due
to patient anatomy.)  Initially started on cipro, cefepime for
history of Pseudomonas pneumonia.  Continued on vanco for
osotemyelitis and home vent settings for night/day.  No
microbiologic evidence of bacteria from sputum, Legionella
antigen negative.  Thought likely secondary to Enterococcus
bacteremia, and cipro, cefepime were discontinued.  Patient's
symptoms subjectively improved.

# R Olecranon Osteomyelitis: Increased vancomycin dose initially
due to low trough, then switched to daptomycin after
consultation with ID as clinically no improvement.  Presumably
no response to vancomycin.

# Enterococcal bacteremia: Initial blood cultures grew
Enterococcus and coag neg Staph.  Patient was continued on
daptomycin and after extensive discussion with ID the decision
was made to continue antibiotic treatment via his picc.  The
risks of removing the picc were high as the patient has
difficult iv access and requires a long course of iv
antibiotics.  The patient will follow up with ID on an
outpatient basis (as he was doing prior to admission for his
osteomyelitis.)

# Chronic obstructive/restrictive pulmonary disease: Continued
on home dose of prednisone 15mg daily and bactrim prophylaxis
with prn nebs and chest PT.  Home regimen of trach mask collar
and SIMV at night was continued.

# Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] Syndrome:  Home pain medications were continued
including methadone, morphine, baclofen, gabapentin, and
ibuprofen (with holding parameters for somnolence).  Bowel
regimen prn constipation.
