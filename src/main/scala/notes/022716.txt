Chief Complaint:
s/p PEA arrest


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 50 year old woman with CHF, COPD and CKD who
presents after PEA prior to going to an clinic appointment in
[**Hospital1 **]. Per report for the patient's nursing facility, the
patient was going to see her PCP to evaluate her tracheostomy
(unclear indication and duration for tracheostomy) and also had
a complaint of SOB and EMS was called to assist in transfer to
this appointment. Following initial contact with EMS the patient
was noted to be unresponsive with agonal breathing and oral
secreation and was subsequently noted to be pulseless at
11:30AM. CPR was initiated. 1mg epinephrine given q5minutes x3.
After second dose she reportedly had ventricular fibrillation
and was shocked at 150J. A pulse returned after third dose of
epinephrine with HR of 12bpm. She was given 0.5mg atropine. She
then returned to PEA and CPR restarted. She recived another 1mg
epinephrine. The patient did not have a stable ROSC until
arrival at [**Hospital3 **] ED at 12:49PM. She was evaluated and
a dopamine drip was started; she was subsequently transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED for further care. EMS reports that she was difficult to
ventilate via bag mask using tracheostomy and was suctioned for
large amounts of secretions en route to [**Hospital1 18**]. She desated to
57% and rose to 89% after suctioning.

On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial evalation in the ED
identified HR 130s SBP in the 80s and SpO2 of 40% and the
patient was endotracheally intubated with immediate impromement
of oxygen saturation. Dopamine was discontinued and she was
started on a Levofed drip. Labs in the ED were notable for a WBC
count of 16.5K with 87% neutrophils and a lactate of 5.6.
Troponin was 0.08 on initial evaluation in the ED. Imaging was
notable for CT head suggestive of anoxic brain injury without
evidence of acute bleed or stroke, chest CTA showed bibasilar
consolidation, apical contusions and no evidence of PE and CT
abdomen and pelvis without evidence of acute pathology. The
patient was then transfered to the MICU for further care.

Vitals on transfer were HR:100, BP:91/47, RR:22 and SpO2:100% on
100% FIO2. Initial evaluation identifies an intubated
unresponsive woman.

EEG [**2191-1-6**]
IMPRESSION: This EEG continues to show an exceptionally severe
encephaolopathy with essentially an isoelectric EEG for the
entire
24-hour period except for a period of five to six minutes, as
noted
above. During that period of time, there was an extremely severe

encephalopathy but it was not isoelectric. This EEG may reflect
underlying severe brain pathology or still may be the effect of
medication or the hypothermia protocol. No seizure activity of
any
nature was identified.

CXR [**2191-1-5**]
IMPRESSION: Bilateral pulmonary opacities may be due to massive
aspiration, although diffuse infection or pulmonary hemorrhage
or contusion not excluded.

CT Chest/ Abdomen/ Pelvis [**2191-1-5**]
1. Pulmonary consolidations likely represent combination of
aspiration and
atelectasis. More anterior ground-glass opacities raise concern
for pulmonary
contusion/hemorrhage.
2. No pulmonary embolism or other definite cause of PEA arrest.
3. ETT terminates 1 cm above the carina and should be withdrawn
2-3cm.
4. Rib fractures of the right anterior sixth and seventh and
left anterior
fifth and sixth ribs, which are nondisplaced.

ECHO [**2191-1-7**]
The left atrium is elongated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 75-80%). The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was a 70 woman with COPD, CAD, HLD and tracheostomy
transfered from [**Hospital3 **] after PEA arrest requiring >60
minutes of CPR and defibrillation x 2 no admitted to the MICU
who was placed on cooling protocol but did not regain corneal or
gag reflexes. Her EEG was isoelectric suggestive of cortical
brain death.
.
# S/P PEA Arrest - Report of events is suggestive of a
respiratory arrest that progressed to a protracted cardiac
arrest with likely compromise of circulation. Possible etiology
of respirtory arrest increased increased mucous production from
pneumonia or and aspiration episode. CT chest was suggestive of
significant aspiration. CTPA was negative for PE. On arrival to
the ICU, patient had fixed and dilated pupils. She was placed on
the cooling protocol. She remained with fixed and dilated
pupils, absent corneal and gag reflexes. EEG was isoelectric.
The neurology service was following and a clinical diagnosis of
cortical brain death was made. After the family was able to
visit, all support measures were withdrawn. She died within
several minutes and the time of death was [**2114**].

# HCAP - Patient complained of shortness of breath prior to PEA
arrest and had consolidations on chest CT. HCAP may have
contribulted to increased mucous producation and arrest episode.
She was treated with Vanc/Zosyn for empric coverage.
