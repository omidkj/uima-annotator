Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 832**]
Chief Complaint:
myelopathy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
c4-c6 decompression with c3-c7 fusion for spinal stenosis


History of Present Illness:
This is a 64 yoF with diastolic CHF, DM2, probable OSA who was
found to have cervical spine stenosis after falling backwards
while trying to step up a high curb, and who as admitted for
cervical spinal decompression and fusion.  She has some
balance/gait issue at baseline due to cervical stenosis (C4~6)
but is able to ambulate without any assistance.
.
Her post-operative course was complicated by a new O2
requirement (low 90s on 4L NC on call-out) likely due to
decompensated CHF in the setting of COPD, low grade post-op
fever to 100.5, delerium, typical CP ruled out for MI and
tachycardic with persistent O2 requirement concerning for PE
that was also ruled out by CTPA. She was also been seen by
ophthalmology for a corectopic right pupil, which is due to an
anterior chamber itraocular lens (AC-IOL).
.
ON THE FLOOR VS were 98 BP:126/46 P:99 R:16 O2:98%.

Imaging:
[**10-13**] C-Spine: INTRAOPERATIVE RADIOGRAPH: A single
intraoperative radiograph for localization is markedly limited.
There is a localizer device posterior to the C2/C3 disc
interspace and C3 vertebral body. Additional localizer device is
seen more inferiorly. The lower cervical vertebral bodies are
not well evaluated secondary to overlying soft tissue. For
further details, please see the intraoperative report.

[**10-14**] CXR Port: Comparison is made with preop evaluation, [**6-3**], [**2109**]. There are low lung volumes. Bibasilar opacities left
greater than right are consistent with atelectasis. There is
mild vascular congestion. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
is partially due to the projection and low lung volumes. There
is no evidence of pneumothorax or large pleural effusions.
Cervical spine hardware is noted. There is unchanged deviation
of the trachea towards the right side. This could be due to an
enlarged thyroid.

[**10-16**] CXR Port: Comparison is made to prior study performed a
day earlier. There are persistent low lung volume. Mild
interstitial edema has minimally improved. Bibasilar opacities
consistent with atelectasis, left greater than right are
unchanged. Right mid lung opacity has resolved consistent with
resolved atelectasis. There is no pneumothorax. Cervical
hardware is present.

[**10-16**] CTPA: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Bibasilar atelectases with trace pleural effusions
bilaterally.
3. Centrilobular emphysema.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

[**10-17**] CXR PA-L: IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Please note cervical hardware appears grossly normal; however, a
chest x-ray is not the recommended modality for evaluation of
this hardware and consider dedicated C-spine radiographs for
more appropriate evaluation.

[**10-16**] C-Spine: compared to CT from [**2110-5-30**].: New mild
prevertebral soft tissue swelling, likely postsurgical. No acute
fracture. C7 not depicted on lateral view.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 98423**] was admitted for a posterior cervical fusion on
[**10-13**]. She tolerated the procedure well, was placed in a
cervical collar, and was managed post-operatively by
neurosurgery. Her post-operative course was complicated by a new
O2 requirement (low 90s on 4L NC on call-out) due to
decompensated dCHF in the setting of COPD, low grade post-op
fever to 100.5, delerium, typical CP ruled out for MI, and sinus
tachycardia likely due to pain, ruled for PE.

# Cervical spine decompression and fusion: See [**2110-10-13**]
operative report for details. Briefly Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**]
performed 1. Cervical laminectomies, C4, C5, and C6. 2.
Arthrodesis, C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7. 3. Instrumentation, C3 to
C7, nonsegmental. 4. Use of allograft for instrumentation, as
well as autograft.5. Placement of [**Location (un) 8766**] head holder for axial
spinal stabilization. The patient tolerated the procedure well.
.
# Post-operative hypoxia due decompensated dCHF: Patient
admitted with known diastolyic dysfunction according to previous
ECHO from 9/[**2108**]. Post-operatively she became hypervolemic due
to IVF and was transferred in respiratory distress on NRB to the
MICU for close monitoring and diuresis; CXR at that time was
equivocal for possible infiltrate and the patient was started on
ceftriaxone and azithromycin for possible CA-PNA. In the
