She was in [**State 15946**] last week on a family vacation. Had two sick

given the opportunity to be treated in the hospital vs. home and
patient requested to be home. Her daughter took her back to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 410**] the following day as she was not improving and she was
found to be hypoxic to high 80s and was sent to the ED.

Notably, her asthma is mild in nature. Never been intubated or
hospitalized. She has never been on steroids. PFTs have been
normal in [**2147**]
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.9 115 103/47 20-24 88% RA. Placed
on NRB -> 100% and titrated down to 10 liters on face mask. She
received two rounds of duonebs and attempted to place on nasal
cannula. She could not tolerate this and was placed back on face
mask at 5 liters.  CXR showed LLL PNA. Labs notable for lactate
of 2.9. Wbc of 14.8 with 7% bands. EKG showed NSR at rate of 87
with TWI in III and aVF. Troponin flat x 1. She was given
levofloxacin and 2 liters of NS. She notably has an erythromcyin
allergy. Last vitals: 99.1 HR: 94 BP: 111/45 RR: 24-28.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, patient was feeling well with out
pain. She was placed on nasal cannula with sats in the low to
mid 90s.

STUDIES:
CXR [**2155-5-21**]:
FINDINGS:

As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
increased,
likely to reflect improved ventilation. As a consequence, the
pre-existing
atelectatic opacities at the left lung base have decreased in
extent and
severity. Unchanged mild cardiomegaly without evidence of
pulmonary edema.
No evidence of pleural effusions. Unchanged severe scoliosis
with subsequent
asymmetry of the rib cage.


Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo F h/o asthma admitted with productive cough, fever,
hypoxia, and infiltrate on CXR consistent with CAP

Active Issues
# Community Acquired Pneumonia: Patient presenting with symptoms
above consistent with CAP. She had brief MICU stay with overall
improved hypoxia and downtrending lactate and leukocytosis with
resolution of bandemia. She was initially started on Ceftriaxone
and Levofloxacin for double coverage of strep pneumo but was
transitioned to levofloxacin alone to complete 10 day course.
Coccidioides Ab, urine legionella, and respiratory viral screen
were negative and sputum cx only positive for yeast. Given
persistent wheezing and bronchospasm on day of discharge, she
was given a prescription for an albuterol inhaler for rescue
use. On day of discharge she was satting low to mid 90s at rest
and with ambulation.

# Asthma:  Continued on Advair and prescribed albuterol as
above.

#. Diarrhea: Patient developed loose stools on HD#2. She did not
have any fever or leukocytosis that suggested a new infection
such as C diff so this was felt to be most likely related to
antibiotic use. C diff was negative x 1. We suggested the use of
probiotics, and noted that although the evidence is limited,
this has been successful for some patients in limiting the
diarrheal symptom.

# Anemia: Markedly decreased from prior in [**2150**] (40.3).  No
signs of active bleeding and iron studies only remarkable for an
elevated ferritin. B12 and folate were normal. This should be
followed up as an outpatient.

# Hypertension: Patient was normotensive with some borderline
low BPs during stay. Her antihypertensives were initially held
in MICU but then amlodipine, atenolol, and losartan were all
restarted. HCTZ was held as patient still seemed slightly
hypovolemic due to decreased PO intake overall and diarrhea so
we continued to hold her hctz until she is seen in follow up for
repeat BP check.

Inactive Issues
# Hypothyroidism: Continued on home dose of Levoxyl per home
dosing.
.
# Osteoporosis: Continue Fosamax as outpatient.
