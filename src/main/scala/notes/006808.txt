Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
T6 cord compression, NSTEMI


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
T4-T7 Laminectomy

History of Present Illness:
73 year old man with severe COPD on 3L home O2, HTN, HL,
osteoporosis status post compression fractures and
vertebrolplasty T11-L1 presented. To [**Hospital6 **] earlier
today complaining of abdominal, back, chest pain starting this
morning, very excruciating that he could not talk. CTA chest and
CT of his abdomen was done which was negative for any aortic
dissection, or any intra-abdominal pathology, and patient began
complaining of severe leg weakness and numbness. Apparently this
leg weakness began at 10 AM. He also complains of urinary
retention and had no rectal tone.  At this point, troponin
returned at .[**Street Address(2) 42984**] depressions.  Emergent MRI without
contrast done at [**Hospital3 **] showed acute T6 fracture with likely
retropulsion versus epidural hematoma compressing the cord at
that level.

ED Course (labs, imaging, interventions, consults):
- Initial Vitals/Trigger: 97.7 68 150/81 18 96% 4L
EKG: His ECGs revealed RBBB and inferior Q waves (old per prior
reports no images available) and 2mm ST depressions V4-V6
(unclear if old or new). Given the ST changes and positive
troponin, cards was consulted, recommended aspirin if cannot get
heparin in the setting of epidural hematoma.
Neurosurg: Looks like he may have mass compressing the spinal
cord.  Needs contrast MRI, patient is likely permanently
paraplegic, they will review the stat images, but have explained
to patient that his likelihood of benefiting from emergent
surgery is minimal. Does NOT recommend heparin due to
possibility of epidural hematoma.
.
Admission Vitals: 75 120/50 14 98% 2L NC, patient chest pain
free at the time of admission.  He is being admitted to the MICU
for neuro checks and relative instability.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient complaining of severe [**9-5**] back
pain which diminished with 1 mg IV dilaudid.

MRI Spine Non contrast:
1. New T6  compression deformity with marrow edema probably
extending into the pedicles  although image quality is
suboptimal due to patient motion. Apparent space  occupying
structure, possibly hemorrhage tracking from the T6 vertebral
level  to the T4 vertebral level and exerting posterior mass
effect on the cord but preserved in some of the posterior
epidural fat. Preliminary findings discussed
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **].
2. Acute to subacute mild compression deformities of the L2 and

L3 vertebrae without central canal or neural foraminal
compromise. New L4  compression deformity since [**2197-8-7**] but
without evidence of marrow edema  suggesting that this fracture
is older.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] W &W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2198-2-25**] 9:53 AM
1. Compression fracture identified at T6 vertebral body with low
signal
intensity, no frank evidence of retropulsion is identified. This
fracture is associated with an epidural collection, likely
consistent with an epidural hematoma extending from T5 through
T7 level, and impinging the spinal cord as described above.
2. Multiple chronic compression fractures are noted at T7, T9,
T11, T12, and L1 levels as described above. Associated
multilevel degenerative changes.
.
EKGs
[**2-24**]
EKG:  NSR with RBBB, LAFB, interatrial conduction disease and
2mm STD V4-V6. QW III, AVF. No prior in our system for
comparison but reports from prior at [**Hospital3 **] (images not
available) have RBBB and inferior Q waves.
.
[**2-25**]
Sinus rhythm with premature atrial contractions. First degree
A-V block.
Right bundle-branch block. Inferior myocardial infarction of
indeterminate
age and lateral-apical ST segment depressions are suggestive of
myocardial
ischemia. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2198-2-24**] premature
atrial
contractions are new and the lateral ST segment changes are new.

.
[**2-28**]
Sinus rhythm. Prior inferolateral myocardial infarction. Right
bundle-branch block. Ongoing ST segment elevation inferiorly
with more prominent ST segment depression in leads I and aVL.
There is variation in precordial lead placement in the lateral
leads. The ST-T wave changes are consistent with ongoing
ischemic process. Rule out myocardial infarction. Followup and
clinical correlation are suggested.
