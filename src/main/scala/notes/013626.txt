Diabetic Ketoacidosis, Hypotension,

Intubation, mechanical ventilation

Arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 85070**] is a 38 year old male with poorly controlled type
1 DM, orthostatic hypotension and who is presented with diarrhea
and inability to walk and was admitted to the MICU with diabetic
ketoaidosis.

According to his parents, and the medical record, he was seen in
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED [**2132-2-11**] for hypoglycemia, he was treated with a D5W
drip and discharged home. Prior to discharge, his finger stick
glucose was "nearly 300" according to his father. [**Name (NI) **] returned
home where he at a full meal and did not take insulin, at
bedtime his glucometer displayed "high" and he did not take any
insulin. The following morning, he complained of polydypsia and
lower extremity weakness. He had a large loose bowel movement
and asked that his mother call EMS as he was unable to rise from
a seated position.

In the ED, initial vitals were T 97.4 p92 BP 74/60 rr18 SaO2
100% on Room air. Labs were remarkable for a glucose of 1043
with HCO3 22 and anion gap of 17, K 6.9, Cr 4.5 (baseline 1.5),
initial ABG showed 6.98/21/95/5 Lactate of 4.0 and Phosphorus
10.0. WBC 16.7, HCT 29. Urine was positive for Ketones. Urine
Drug screen was negative. He was given 6L IVNS and a left Sub
Clavian line was placed and norepinephrine. FAST  Bedside u/s
showed no pericardial effusion. EKG was remarkable for STE in
V1-2 with recroprical STD ini II III and aVF. Code STEMI was
called, he was evaluated by cardiology who believed that that
the EKG changes can be seen with electrolyte abnormalities and
acidosis and recommended giving aspirin, sending troponins and
repeating the EKG. Trop-T: 0.43 CK: 164  MB: 9.
Repeat ABG showed 6.85/35/180/7. He was then observed to have a
fixed gaze to the left, he was unresponsive and given ativan 2mg
IV afterwhich his level of consciousness improved only to become
unresponsive. He was then intubated with fentanyl/versed and
admitted to the MICU. After intubation, OG tube which returned
black coffee ground, rectal exam was GUIAC positive. GI was
consulted who recommended pantoprazole and HCT checks. He was
started on Vanc/Zosyn and CTX. Vitals on transfer P:95 BP:127/57
100%  Fio2 100% 500/5

Of note, he was recently treated for a cellulitis involving his
right lower extremity.

On arrival to the MICU, rectal temp was T:92.3 HR:90 BP 134/56
450/26 100% FiO2 he was intubated and sedated and unable to
contribute to the medical history.

leave the house on  account of severe arthritis. He does not
work.

TTE [**2133-2-12**]
he left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal

excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with
near-hyperdynamic systolic function. Normal right ventricular
size and function. No significant valvular abnormality seen.
