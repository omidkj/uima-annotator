Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86-year-old
female with a history of hypertension, diabetes and past
cerebrovascular accident who was in her usual state of health
until the morning of admission when she awakened from sleep
at 2 AM with chest pain.  The patient was squeezing,
radiating across her chest into her back and was associated
with diaphoresis.  She denied any shortness of breath,
nausea, vomiting or palpitations.  She initially thought it
was indigestion, took Maalox and tried to return to sleep.
When the symptoms persisted, a friend came over and EMS was
phoned after a total of four hours since the onset of
symptoms.

The patient was brought to the Emergency Room, where she was
found to be having an inferior myocardial infarction.  She
was also found to be in ventricular tachycardia.  She
required one shock and successfully converted to sinus
rhythm.  She was placed on lidocaine drip.  She was then
brought to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory, where she
was found to have three vessel disease.  The right coronary
artery, which was felt to be the culprit lesion underwent
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting.

CARDIAC RISK FACTORS:  Cardiac risk factors were positive for
noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus and hypertension.  The
patient was also a former smoker, but had quit over ten years
ago.  She denied hypercholesterolemia.  She did describe a
family history of coronary artery disease, but not before the
age of 55.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The review of systems revealed gradually
limited mobility secondary to increasing shortness of breath
and dyspnea on exertion.  However, the patient denied any
chest pain or lightheadedness with exertion.  She denied any
leg swelling.  She denied any orthopnea or paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea.  She denied any recent weight changes.  No
recent fevers, chills, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or
dysuria were noted.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
3.  Status post cerebrovascular accident.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide 37.5/25 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Levoxyl 100 mcg p.o. q.d.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Dipyridamole 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Albuterol metered dose inhaler.
8.  Serevent metered dose inhaler b.i.d.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient had a strong family history of
coronary artery disease on her mother's side, with her mother
dying of myocardial infarction at the age of 60 and her
sister dying of myocardial infarction at the age of 62.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was a former smoker, having
smoked one pack per day times 30 years and quitting over ten
years ago.  She denied alcohol use.  She lived alone in a
senior [**Hospital3 **] facility.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient's vital signs
showed a heart rate of 91 and regular, a blood pressure of
127/80 and an oxygen saturation of 93% on five liters by
nasal cannula.  In general, the patient was comfortable and
in no apparent distress.  The pupils were reactive and the
sclerae were anicteric.  The mucous membranes were moist.

The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The heart
was regular with a normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  The abdomen was soft, nontender and nondistended
with normal active bowel sounds.  The extremities were
without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  There were weak
bilateral distal pulses.

LABORATORY:  On admission, the CBC showed a white blood cell
count of 13,700, hematocrit of 43.8 and platelet count of
250,000.  Coagulation studies showed a prothrombin time of
13.7, partial thromboplastin time of 24.5 and INR of 1.2.
Chem 7 revealed a sodium of 142, potassium of 3.3, chloride
of 99, bicarbonate of 28, BUN of 22, creatinine of 0.9 and
glucose of 285.  The admission CPK was 330 with an MB of 14
and an index of 4.  The initial troponin was 3.4.

RADIOLOGY:  A chest x-ray showed sight left ventricular
enlargement with no evidence for congestive heart failure.
There was hyperinflation of the lungs.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  The admission electrocardiogram showed
sinus rhythm of 70 beats per minute and an axis of about 30
degrees.  There were T waves in II, III and aVF with ST
elevations in the same leads.  The ST elevations were greater
in III than in II.  There were large R waves with ST
depressions in V2 through V3.  There were also ST depressions
in aVL.  There were small Q waves in V5 through V6.  This was
consistent with an inferoposterior infarct, likely proximal
right coronary artery territory.

CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION FINDINGS:  Angiography of the
patient's right dominant system revealed three vessel disease
with a normal left main coronary artery.  There was a twin
left anterior descending artery system with severe diffuse
disease in both vessels.  The vessel twin had a long area of
diffuse disease in the proximal and mid vessel to 80%.  The
lateral twin had similar diffuse disease.  The left
circumflex coronary artery had a 70% proximal lesion.  The
single large obtuse marginal artery had serial 90% lesions at
the ostium and proximal vessel.  The right coronary artery
was a large dominant vessel with an 80% ulcerated lesion in
the proximal segment.  Hemodynamics revealed marked elevation
of the right and left heart filling pressures with a normal
cardiac output (right atrial pressure of 18, pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of 22 and cardiac index of 2.8).

The patient underwent successful percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty and stenting of the right coronary
artery with 0% residual stenosis.  The cardiac
catheterization was notable for a small perforation of the
right coronary artery.  An emergent echocardiogram in the
Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory revealed no signs of
coronary tamponade.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Post catheterization, the patient was
admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit and followed for a question
of perforation of her right coronary artery during cardiac
catheterization.  A follow up echocardiogram revealed no
evidence for cardiac tamponade.  The remainder of her post
infarct course was notable for the development of atrial
fibrillation as well as a second episode of ventricular
tachycardia that required cardioversion and amiodarone drip.

On [**2143-2-28**], the patient went to the Electrophysiologic
Laboratory, where she had an ICD implanted.  The patient
otherwise remained hemodynamically stable and was discharged
to rehabilitation on [**2143-3-2**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Acute myocardial infarction, inferoposterior.
2.  Ventricular tachycardia times two, both episodes
requiring cardioversion.

6.  Hypothyroidism.
