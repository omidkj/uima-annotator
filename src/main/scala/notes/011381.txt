Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, shortness of breath, diarrhea, chills

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
DC cardioversion x 2

History of Present Illness:
79 year old man with a PMH of CABG [**92**] years ago, CVA, HTN, DM,
CKD (? baseline Cr.), who presents with SSCP that started on the
afternoon of [**2162-12-26**], associated with shortness of breath. The
pain has been intermittant, lasting between 5 and 20 minutes.
Also starting [**12-26**], he has had nausea, diarrhea (liquid
brown-green, 20+ bm per day per his report), dysuria, and
shaking chills. He has had dysuria and frequency as well. He
denies vomiting. He denies recent antibiotics or
hospitalizations. He recently forgot his nitro patch when he was
vacationing in [**State **].  He also has not been taking his insulin
(lantus) because he felt he didn't need it as he was not eating
much with his diarrhea and other complaints.
.
Patient became CP free in the ED with 2 x SL NTG.  He was found
to have a troponin leak (ruled in for NSTEMI), UTI, DKA
(resolved in ED) and was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service, where he
was maintained on medical management with ASA, BB, statin, nitro
gtt, no heparin as pt w/ hematuria.  For his UTI, he was started
on levofloxacin.  He was also started empirically on flagyl for
C Diff.
.
Patient was stable on floor until morning of [**12-31**] when medical
team got called that patient was c/o chest pain.  On eval, pt
noted to be in sustained VT, semi-stable with HR 160's and BP
80's/60's.  Patient was given 5mg IV lopressor x 1, lidocaine
100mg IV x 1, and was transferred to CCU and cardioverted with
180 joules.  VT became polymorphic -> monomorphic with
lidocaine.  He was then given an amiodarone bolus (150mg over 10
minutes) and started on amiodarone drip 1mg/min x 6 hours and
0.5mg/min x 18 hours.
.
Currently patient in AFib, good rate control, BP stable,
mentating well, no complaints of chest pain/pressure, shortness
of breath.  c/o penile discomfort [**2-3**] catheter.
.

Past Medical History:
PMHx:
1.) CAD s/p CABG [**92**] years ago - His family states that they have
breached the subject of PCI on multiple occasions with his
longstanding friend and cardiologist in [**Location (un) 5131**] ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3315**]) and have always opted for conservative, medical,
management. Given his multiple medical issues the plan is to do
as little as possible re: interventions.
Per family, last cath 4 years ago - will obtain OSH records.
2.) s/p CVA (no obvious residual defecits)
3.) HTN
4.) DM (type 2 on lantus, glipizide)
5.) CKD (? baseline Cr)
6.) ? Hx. A fib?
7.) CHF
RECENT ECHO [**2162-12-29**]: EF 35%
Conclusions:
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior and
inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis and distal anterior septal
and apical akinesis/hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Social History:

etoh, former smoker (quit 40 yrs ago).

PROCEDURE DATE: [**2163-1-4**]
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Coronary artery disease. s/p CABG. Ventricular tachycardia.
NSTEMI.
Chest pain.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Native three vessel and left main coronary artery disease.
2. Patent SVG-RCA and SVG-D. Stenosis of the proximal SVG-LAD.
3. Successful stenting of the proximal SVG ( to LAD)
COMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated severe
native three vessel and left main coronary artery disease in
this right
dominant circulation. The LMCA had a 60% stenosis in the distal
vessel.
The LAD was totally occluded proximally. A small diagonal branch
with
diffuse disease filled from the SVG-D. The distal LAD was
diffusely
diseased. A ramus intermedius is present without flow limiting
disease.
The LCX was totally occluded in the ostium. The RCA was totally
occluded
in the proximal vessel. The distal RCA filled via the SVG-RCA.
2. Graft angiography demonstrated the SVG-RCA with a distal 50%
stenosis
at the touchdown site. The SVG-D was patent. The SVG-LAD had an
80%
proximal stenosis, moderate mid vessel disease, and a
moderate-severe
stenosis proximal to the touchdown site.
3. Left ventriculography not performed to reduce contast load.
4. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated mild systemic
arterial
hypertension.
5. Successful stenting using a 2.0 X 18mm Mini vision bare metal
stent
and post dilation using a 2.5 X 15mm NC Ranger balloon of the
proximal
SVG (to LAD) with lesion reduction from 80% to 10%. The final
angiogram
showed TIMI III flow with no dissection or embolisation.

[**2163-1-16**] CXR: An endotracheal tube has been withdrawn slightly in
the interval, now terminating approximately 4.5 cm above the
carina. Other indwelling devices are unchanged in position. The
heart remains enlarged and there is persistent vascular
engorgement. There is a bilateral asymmetrical patt
