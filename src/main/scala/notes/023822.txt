Diarrhea and dehydration

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
61 yo female with metastatic colon cancer (to liver), currently
treated with Irinotecan, 5FU, Leukovorin, Avastin and Decadron
presents with profuse watery diarrhea since [**2109-9-28**].  Patient
started first cycle of chemotherapy on [**9-19**], at which time she
received 10mg decadron, irinotecan, 5FU, leukovorin and avastin.
 She tolerated this well except for fairly severe hyperglycemia
(to 400),which required one visit to the EW but no hospital
admission. She then had the 2nd half of the first cycle of
chemotherapy on [**9-26**], which included 5mg decadron, 5FU,
irinotecan and leucovorin. She then began having watery diarrhea
on [**9-28**]. She was advised to start taking Ciprofloxacin by her
oncologist on [**9-30**].  She had a temp to 100.6 at home and had
dry heaves, otherwise no other constitutional sx. On [**10-3**], pt
was too weak to get up, brought to EW at [**Hospital 8125**] Hospital for
evaluation.  There, bp was 83/47 on arrival, down to 62/28 after
1L NS, remained 70s-80s/30s-40s after 2nd liter IVF. Received 2g
ceftazidime and 500mg flagyl. Labs notable for Na 129, K 5.1,
bicarb 14, creat 1.5 (baseline 0.8). Blood cx sent. Pt
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] due to severe hypotension. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
she continued to be hypotensive with SBP's of  90's and given 2L
NS in 4 bnoluses with mild improvement and antihypertensives
were held. Since she was neutropenic with ANC of 450 with no
obvious source of infection she was started on broad antibiotic
coverage of ceftazidime, flagyl and gentamycin. She remained
afebrile, SBP improved to 90's to 120's overnight, and
creatinine continued to trend down. Infectious workup including
blood Cx, Urine Cx, chest Xray, O and P as well as stool
cultures were sent, and all of which are negative thus far. Pt
has continued to put out 2.5L/d diarrhea despite symptomatic
treatment with octreotide and loperamide.

Brief Hospital Course:
Diarrhea-Volume of diarrhea decreased throughout the
hospitalization, but continued to have a very watery
consistency. Recent history of daughters with diarrhea was
concerning for infectious etiology, although lack of abdominal
cramping make toxin producing secretory diarrhea unlikely. She
remained afebrile with no elveated WBC now off antibiotics for 4
days.  Cdiff, stool culture and O and P continued to be negative
althogh fecal leukocytes were present. Most likely cause was
thought to be recent chemotherapy regimen of decadron,
irinotecan, 5FU, leukovorin and avastin with most offensive
[**Doctor Last Name 360**] in causing diarrhea being irinotecan and leukovorin. We
continued to treat diarrhea with octreotide, loperamide,
kaolin/pectin and cholestyramine along with modified [**Last Name (un) **] diet.
On th day of discharge she had only 1bm in the last 24 hours,
and was able to use the bed pan.

Hypotension-Vigorous response of SBP to fluid resuscitation
never requiring pressors made hypovolemia most likely cause in
combination with her AS. Lactate never measured but clinically
she has never presented as being septic with fever.  We held on
her outpatient antihypertensive medications and added back only
atenolol on [**10-10**]. Pt was orthostatic with PT on [**10-10**], but this
resolved with IV hydration with 1L NaBicarb and SBP remained
>103.

ARF-Due to prerenal state with loss of intravascular volume
through diarrhea now back to baseline. Low GFR during
hypovolemic state also may have caused hyperkalemia. Creatinine
continued to improve with IV hydration and improved PO intake.

DM-Pt initially taken off her outpatient glyburide due to poor
PO intake while in ICU. Glyburide added bakc on [**10-10**] since she
was taking PO well and BS remained in th low 200's although they
continued to remain poorly controlled on her outpatient dose of
5mg qd.

Metastatic colon CA-Held off on irinotecan, 5FU, leukovorin and
avastin due to diarrhea and informed pt that longterm
chemotherapy plan would be discussed once her diarrhea resolved
and she was discharged home.

Depression-Stable on her outpatient Celexa 20mg qd.

FEN-Previous electroylte abnornalities were all consistent with
diarrhea and hypovolemia including hypovolemic hyponatremia and
loss of bicarb in diarrhea. Hypercalcemia was due to continue
Lasix use in prerenal state.

Px-She was placed on SC heparin, pneumoboots, and PPI continued
while she was in hospital but discontinued on discharge.
