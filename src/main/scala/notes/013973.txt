Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
ataxia/unsteady gait, transferred to MICU for further eval and
treatment of evolving stroke.

intubation & bronchoscopy
liver biopsy
Left internal jugular central venous catheter placement
Right radial arterial catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a 72 yo F with h/o DM, OSA, right hemispheric CVA in the
past, ?seizure disorder admitted on [**2146-12-4**] with chief complaint
of ataxia and unsteady gait. Patient reportedly woke up to go to
the kitchen and felt dizzy and unsteady on her feet. She hit her
head against her bed room door without falling, no LOC. She
vomitied twice, no blood. She then called her sister to bring
her into the hospital. On admission she had left lateral
nystagmus, increased tone thoughout, brisk reflexes, weakness
noted in left arm and leg suggestive UMN pattern. Prior neuro
exams only suggestive of mild left hand weakness after CVA [**2144**].
CT performed in the ED showed a 5 mm hypodensity in the right
basal ganglia. She then began to have work finding difficulty
during her hospital stay and now is progressively more
inattentive, less responsive, non verbal. Neurology evaluation
feels this is an evolving embolic CVA. MRI showed occlusion of
the R ICA with watershed infarction in the right hemisphere on
[**12-4**]. Repeat MR today showed extension of the right infarct with
multiple other small watershed infarcts in the thalmus and left
hemisphere. The patient also presented with pancytopenia making
anticoagulation difficult. The decision to initiate heparin
therapy had been postponed however was started on the evening of
transfer given her worsening symptoms.
.
In addition, she was noted to have a nodule on a CXR performed
in the ED, CT of the chest showed multiple nodules concerning
for either infection vs. malignancy. CT abd/pelvis showed
hpodensities in the liver and spleen with multiple lymph nodes
however no mass. She is up-to-date with her age appropriate
cancer screening. As stated above, she was noted to be
pancytopenic suggesting a possible underlying bone marrow
process. In [**4-26**] her plts were ~400 however on admission they
were 30-40's. Her Hct was 41 in [**2141**] then low 30's starting in
[**11-25**]. Her WBC count started to trend down in [**11-25**] as well.
.
She was transfered to the MICU for monitoring given initiation
of anticoagulation in the setting of thrombocytopenia as well as
for tight BP control.
.
ROS (per records), she denied any CP, SOB, palpitations, HA,
vision changes or weakness. She reported some chronic neck
stiffness that is unchanged. The patient travelled to [**Country 480**]
from 12/3-23/06 but did not participate in any risky behavior.
She was on an organized tour to South [**Last Name (LF) 480**], [**First Name3 (LF) 16465**] and [**Country 3399**]
and ate in restaurants, drank bottled water. She took malaria
ppx with Malarone (atovaquone/ plaquenil) for 10 days but then
lost it. She received oral typhoid vaccine before the trip. She
denies any mosquito bite or contact exposures to animals. Of
note, she reported a positive TB test in the past (15 yrs and 5
yrs ago) but never recieved treatment.

9)Sickle trait


Social History:
Lives alone in [**Location (un) 86**]. Supportive family nearby. Remote history

intercourse.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
[**12-4**] CT w/out contrast:
No acute intracranial hemorrhage. Left subcutaneous hematoma.
Persistent prominence of the ventricles, unchanged since prior
study. 5 mm hypodensity in the right basal ganglia, either cyst
or prior infarct.
.
CXR [**12-4**]
2.5 cm and 8 mm nodular opacities projecting over right mid
lung,
highly concerning for malignancy. Dedicated chest CT is
recommended to further evaluate these findings.
.
CT Chest w/out contrast
1. Multiple consolidations and ill-defined nodules and numerous
small nodules mostly in centrilobular distribution. The finding
is most likely representing infectious process, likely bacterial
infection, however, given the appearance, possibilities of
fungal infection or tuberculosis infection should be considered.

2.Given the liver lesion and lymphadenopathy described below,
some of the nodules especially larger nodules can represent
metastasis if there is underlying malignancy. Please correlate
clinically, and please closely follow after appropriate
treatment.
3. Bilateral axillary and right paratracheal lymphadenopathy,
also
concerning for malignancy.
4. Multiple hypodense liver lesions, only partially visualized,
of unknown origin however is strongly worrisme for metastasis
from underlying malignancy such as colon or breast cancer.
Please correlate clinically, and please perform dedicated
abdominal imaging such as ultrasound or contrast enhanced CT if
renal function permits.
.
EKG [**12-4**] NSR
.
MRA Brain [**12-4**]:
Occlusion of the right ICA with watershed infarction in the
right
hemisphere. Occlusion or severe stenosis of the left vertebral
artery.
.
CTA Head & Neck [**12-6**]
Complete occlusion of the right internal carotid artery. Patent,

but diminutive left vertebral artery.
.
TTE [**12-7**]: EF >55%, 1+ MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] vegetations seen.
.
CTA Abd/Pelvis [**12-6**]
No clear primary malignancy. With the constellation of findings
of multiple pulmonary nodules, ill-defined liver and splenic
lesions, and lymphadenopathy, metastatic disease cannot be
excluded. However, infectious etiology such as TB could explain
these findings. An MRI of the liver is recommended for further
characterization of the liver lesions.
.
MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] [**12-8**]
1. There is unknown total occlusion of the right internal
carotid artery. There is some flow in the right MCA, primarily
from the anterior communicating artery and right A1 segment,
which appears to be small. The current study extends further
superiorly showing enlargement of the distal right anterior
cerebral artery, suggesting that it supplies collaterals to the
right MCA territory.
2. The left vertebral artery is congenitally small and poorly
seen on MRAs.
.
TEE [**12-9**]: No cardiac source of embolus identified. No
echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis or abscess
identified.
.
