History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 84119**] is a 85 yo F with dementia and b/l PEs on a heparin
drip who sustained a tracheal tear on traumatic intubation
[**2168-12-15**] for respiratory failure. She was stabilized on the vent
with a PEEP of [**Hospital3 84120**] and found to have
sub-cutaneous emphysema post-intubation. She was assessed by
their intensivist and CT surgeon and determined to have a
moderately sized tear in the distal [**12-25**] of the trachea extending
to just above the carina. She
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for specialty care and at the request
of the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy, her son [**Name (NI) **]. She is full
code.

The patient had a recent fall in [**10-31**] and sustained a C2
odontoid fracture and has been in a [**Location (un) 2848**] J collar. She had been
at a nursing facility and was noticed to be short of breath on
[**12-10**] - on admission to [**Hospital3 **] she was found to have
b/l PEs and started on a heparin drip. She had been doing well
until [**12-15**] pm when she developed respiratory distress and was
found to
have a PCO2 of 95 and was promptly intubated with a fiberoptic
scope. It was during this procedure that she sustained the
tracheal tear.

[**2169-1-11**] CXR FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-10**],
there may be slight clearing at the left base. Diffuse
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists with mild
elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Bilateral pleural
effusions with compressive bibasilar atelectasis persist.
Tracheostomy tube remains in place.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**2168-12-16**] - Ms. [**Known lastname 84119**] was admitted to the SICU.  She was
managed with ventilatory support and a heparin drip for her PEs.
 The following summarizes her hospital course beginning [**2168-12-16**]
and ending [**2169-1-13**].

Neuro:  Ms. [**Known lastname 84119**] was initially sedated with versed/fentanyl
while intubated.  Her neurologic status began to decline,
however, and she sedation was discontinued on [**2168-12-26**], at which
point she resumed awakening to voice and following commands.
She required prn Zyprexa for agitation throughout the remaining
ICU course and she was given prn dilaudid for pain. She wears a
[**Location (un) 2848**] J collar for hx of odontoid fracture since [**69**].09. She was
transitioned to PO pain medications as needed.

CV:  On initial presentation, she required pressors for blood
pressure support.  Over the next several days in the ICU, the
pressors were weaned and she was hemodynamically stable.  She
did have intermittent episodes of supraventricular tachycardia
and hypertension, which were typically self-limited but
occasionally did require IV lopressor; she was transitioned to
PO lopressor on [**2169-1-4**]. She remained on heparin gtt for history
of PE and afib. Coumadin was started on [**2169-1-10**] 3mg each night,
and at time of discharge her INR is 1.4; therefore she is still
transitioning from heparin to coumadin.

Resp: Ms. [**Known lastname 84119**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] flexible bronchoscopy upon arrival
to the SICU which demonstrated a large tracheal laceration; she
remained intubated and sedated.  On [**12-27**], she [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] a
repeat bronchoscopy which demonstrated evidence of clot in the
posterior trachea.  On [**12-28**] she was taken to the operating room
and [**Month/Year (2) 1834**] open tracheostomy placement without complication.
On [**12-30**], CXR demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions. Chest
ultrasound revealed small fluid collections not conducive to
thoracentesis. Bronchoscopy revealed persistent clot along
posterior trachea, below level of tracheostomy tube, and
moderate R-sided mucus.  On [**12-31**], tracheostomy tube partially
dislodged, manually replaced by RN.  Bronchoscopy revealed tube
in good position.  On [**1-3**], bronchoscopy revealed persistent
right sided mucus, amenable to suctioning.  She was transitioned
from CMV ventilation to CPAP, and intermittently she required
CMV support due to low tidal volumes and tachypnea.  On [**1-10**] she
was transitioned to trach mask, which she tolerated well,
resting with CPAP at night.  On [**1-11**] and [**1-12**] she used limited
CPAP for support and tolerated increasingly long periods of
trach mask.

GI:  Tube feeds were initiated at time of admission, which were
administered via Dobhoff tube and well tolerated.  She had
copious diarrhea and C.diff cultures were positive on [**12-17**].
She was started on IV flagyl.  On [**12-27**] repeat C.diff cultures
were positive and she was started on PO vancomycin via NGT.  She
continued to have diarrhea until [**1-7**], and the PO vanc/flagyl
were d/c'd on [**1-10**].  A PEG tube was placed at the bedside
without complication on [**1-9**] and tube feeds were re-initiated
[**1-10**] without incident. Tube feed goals are Replete with fiber at
50cc/hr.

GU:  Foley catheter was placed on admission and maintained due
to her bedbound status.  Urine culture on [**12-23**] was negative.
Her weight increased steadily on the first 10 days of her
hospitalization and she was started on a gentle lasix gtt, which
was transitioned to oral lasix. She required intermittent
potassium supplementation while on lasix.  Given her history of
cardiomyopathy, it is important to check daily weights, and
daily lytes and adjust potassium for lasix dosing in rehab.

Heme:  Ms. [**Known lastname 84119**] was maintained on a heparin gtt with goal
PTT 60-80 from the time of admission for her known PEs.  She
remained hemodynamically stable and did not require blood
products throughout the admission.  Coumadin therapy was
initiated on [**1-10**].

ID:  Ms. [**Known lastname 84119**] was started on a course of IV vancomycin and
meropenem for mediastinitis in the setting of a known tracheal
laceration.  Blood cultures were negative throughout the
hospitalization and the IV vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830
