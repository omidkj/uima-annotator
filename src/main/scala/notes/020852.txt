[**7-14**] Head CT IMPRESSION:
1. Large right cerebellar intraparenchymal hemorrhage with
associated edema and mass effect including early upward
transtentorial herniation and
hydrocephalus.

2. Intraventricular hemorrhage involving the right lateral,
third, and fourth ventricles.

3. Old right MCA infarct.
MPRESSION:
1. Interval increase in right frontoparietal hemorrhage (2:21),
now measuring 9 x 11 mm; no new hemorrhage seen.
2. Minimally changed appearance of right cerebellar hemispheric
hematoma,
with right-sided upward transtentorial herniation, unchanged.
3. Intraventricular hemorrhage with associated hydrocephalus,
s/p placement of right transfrontal ventriculostomy catheter
with expected tiny foci of right frontal extra-axial
pneumocephalus.

[**7-17**] Head CT IMPRESSION:
1. No significant interval change in right cerebellar hemorrhage
with upward transtentorial herniation. Stable right
frontoparietal hemorrhage and previously noted left-sided
subarachnoid hemorrhage on current exam.

2. Stable amount of intraventricular hemorrhage within the
occipital horns
with slight interval decrease in the amount of hemorrhage within
the fourth ventricle. Slight decrease in ventricular size as
detailed above.

Brief Hospital Course:
This patient is a 73F awoke the morning of [**2127-7-14**] at her
[**Hospital3 **] center c/o
dizziness and nausea. She was taken to [**Last Name (un) 1724**] and found to have a R
cerebellar
hemorrhage. Pt became lethargic, was intubated and transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. Given her posterior fossa
hemorrhage, she quickly developed hydrocephalus requiring an EVD
on the 7th.

On [**7-16**], the patient had brief episodes of SVT  and troponin
leak, with systolic blood pressure above 200 accompanied with
hypoxia, an PE workup was negative.  A cardiology evaluation was
also obtained for persistent hypertension, an Echo was obtained
to evaluate cardiac function. Patient clinically appeared to by
in heart failure and improved with aggressive diuresis.

The patient was extubated on [**7-20**] and was following commands on
the right, but remained weak on the left. She was reintubated on
[**7-22**] for respiratory failure and had a troponin leak with a
Nstemi. A follow up MRI/MRA revealed a R MCA infarct.

on [**7-25**] she had a bedside tracheostomy performed. On [**7-27**] she
was diagnosed with right wrist cellulitis and seen by plastic
surgery and started on Ancef.

on [**7-29**] she went to interventional radiology for placement of a
gastrojejunostomy
tube with the tip in the jejunum.
