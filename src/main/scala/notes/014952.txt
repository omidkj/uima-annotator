CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: eval post op

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
71 year old woman s/p MVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval post op
REASON FOR THE STUDY: Evaluation postop.

TECHNIQUE OF THE STUDY: PA and lateral view of the chest.

Comparison is done to the study done on [**6-30**].

FINDINGS: There are bilateral small pleural effusions that are
new compared to the previous study. There is improved
retrocardiac opacity. There is spina bifida occulta at the level
of T3 thoracic vertebra. Heart size, mediastinal and hilar
contours are normal.

IMPRESSION: New mild bilateral pleural effusions. Improving
retrocardiac atelectasis.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the
body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA
and extending into the RV. PFO is present. Bidirectional shunt
across the
interatrial septum at rest.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Mild regional LV
systolic
dysfunction. Mildly depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Normal ascending aorta
diameter. Simple
atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter. There
are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Myxomatous mitral valve leaflets. Mild MVP. Normal
mitral valve
supporting structures. Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate [2+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify

Conclusions:
Prebypass

1.The left atrium is elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is
seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. A
patent foramen
ovale is present. There is a bidirectional shunt across the
interatrial septum
at rest.

2.Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is mild
regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Overall left ventricular
systolic function
is mildly depressed.

3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

4.There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.

6.The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. There is mild mitral
valve
prolapse of A3 and P3 portion.. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation
is seen. The regurgitant jet is central. The vena contracta
measures 0.6 cm.
There is systolic blunting noted in all four pulmonary veins.

7.The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen.

8. There is a small pericardial effusion.

Poor transgastric views.

The TEE probe was placed in a very atraumatic manner given the
patient has a
history of esophageal dilatation. Currently asymptomatic.

Post [**Name (NI) 67831**] pt is a paced, on epi at .02 mcg/kg/min

1. A prosthetic ring is in place in the mitral position. Mean
gradient is 3 mm
hg, peak 16 mm hg..

2. There is 1+ mitral regurgitation (mild).

3. Tricuspid regurgitation is unchanged at moderate

4. Aortic contours are intact/unchanged.

5. The remaining exam is unchanged from pre bypass.

6. All findings discussed with surgeons at the time of the exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on [**2169-6-16**] for cath prior to MV repair.
She underwent cardiac cath which revealed clean coronaries,
slightly ^ filling pressures, 3+MR, and an EF of 55%. On [**2169-6-29**]
she underwent MV repair with a 28 mm annuloplasty band.  Cross
clamp time was 38 mins and total bypass time was 56 mins.  She
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU on
Epi, Propofol and Neo.  She was extubated on the post op night
and was weaned off her drips.  She required aggressive resp. rx.
and was transferred to the floor on POD#1.  Her chest tubes were
d/c'd and on POD#3 her epicardial wires were d/c'd.
Anticoagulation with coumadin was restarted and on POD#5 she was
discharged to home in stable condition.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 24717**] will follow
her INR post op and adjust her coumadin for an INR of [**1-12**].5
