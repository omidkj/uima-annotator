History of Present Illness:
51 y/o female who was diagnosed with [**Company 8813**] stenosis 10-15 years
ago. He has been monitored with serial echocardiograms, but has
recently noticed increased in dyspnea on exertion. Most recent
echo revealed an LVEF of 50% and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.62 cm2 and 2+ MR.

Pertinent Results:
[**2151-4-22**] Chest CT: Probable [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] stenosis. Mild post-stenotic
[**Month/Day/Year 8813**] dilatation. No ascending [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] calcification.
.
[**2151-4-22**] Cardiac Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system demonstrated no angiographically apparent
flow limiting coronary artery disease. The LMCA, LAD, LCX and
RCA were patent. 2. Resting hemodynamics were performed. The
right sided filling pressures were elevated (mean RA pressure
was 11mmHg and RVEDP was 13mmHg). The pulmonary artery pressures
were elevated measuring 63/32mmHg. The left sided filling
pressures were elevated (mean PCW pressure was 24mmHg and LVEDP
was 33mmHg). The systemic arterial pressures were within normal
range measuring 114/77mmHg. The cardiac index was depressed at
1.5 l/min/m2. There was a 65 mmHg gradient across the [**Month/Day/Year 8813**]
valve upon pull back of the catheter from the left ventricle to
the ascending aorta corresponding to an [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve area of
0.5cm2. 3. Contrast ventriculography revealed a normal ejection
of 56% with normal wall motion. Moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation (3+) was noted.
.
[**2151-4-23**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The [**Month/Day/Year 8813**]
valve is bicuspid. There is moderate [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] valve stenosis (area
1.0) There is no dilatation of the ascending aorta or the arch.
Sinotubular junction is well preserved. Moderate to severe (3+)
[**Month/Day/Year 8813**] regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no definite leaflet prolapse or flail seen. The mitral
annulus size is 3.0cm. There is dilatation of the left atrium.
There is no pericardial effusion. Post-Bypass: Normal Right
ventricular systolic function. LVEF is 40=45% on epinephrine
0.03mcg/kg/min. Ascending [**Month/Day/Year 8813**] contour is well preserved.
There is a prosthesis in the mitral annular position, stable and
functioning well. There is no residual MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 8813**]
valve bioprosthesis is stable in position and opening well. The
peak gradient is 22mg of HG. There is a small eccentric AI jet
and discussed with surgeon and it seems to be decreasing in
size.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**4-22**] Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken for a cardiac cath which revealed
severe [**Known lastname 8813**] stenosis and moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation without coronary disease. On [**4-23**] he was taken to
the operating room where he underwent a [**Month/Day (4) 8813**] valve replacement
and mitral valve repair. Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery he was transferred to the
CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. By post-op day
one he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and
extubated. He was started on beta blockers and diuretics and
gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight. On post-op day two
his chest tubes were removed and he was transferred to the SDU.
Early on post-op day three he had episode of rapid atrial
fibrillation and Amiodarone bolus was given (followed by PO
Amiodarone). Pt. has remained in NSR since then, is
hemodynamically stable, and ready to be discharged home.
