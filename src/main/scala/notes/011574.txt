Service:  MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 59 year old
male with a history of metastatic Stage IV adenocarcinoma of
the lung with metastases to the brain and neck who presented
to an outside hospital in mid [**2104-1-8**], with right sided
chest pain.  CT angiogram was positive for pulmonary embolism
and pericardial effusion.  The patient was started on Heparin
and developed HIT antibodies and was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**] for Hirudin treatment.

An echocardiogram was positive for tamponade, and the patient
underwent pericardiocentesis which showed malignant cells. An
inferior vena cava filter was placed at that time as
anticoagulation was contraindicated in this patient with
bleeding pericardial effusion.  He was discharged home on
[**2104-1-20**].  Follow-up echocardiogram on [**2104-1-23**], showed
slight diminution in the pericardial effusion.

On the day of admission, the patient called his oncologist
complaining of left leg pain and swelling.  He denied
shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills.  He was sent
to the Emergency Department where his vital signs were
stable.  Ultrasound of his lower extremity showed extensive
deep vein thrombosis in his left lower extremity.  Cardiology
was consulted at that point who felt that anticoagulation was
still an extreme risk in this patient with a history of
bloody pericardial effusion.

In the Emergency Department, the patient also had
intermittent rapid atrial fibrillation up to a rate of 190
which broke spontaneously and the patient converted to normal
sinus rhythm, however, he remained tachycardic.  He was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for close
observation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung with metastases to
the brain and neck. Status post Carboplatin and Taxol, status
post right upper lobe wedge section in [**2102-10-8**]. Status
post suboccipital craniotomy with tumor resection [**2103-11-8**].  Status post course of Decadron [**2103-11-8**].
2.  Status post pericardial effusion with tamponade,
pulmonary embolus as described in history of present illness
[**2104-1-8**].
3.  Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Prednisone 10 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Accupril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Wellbutrin.
5.  Indocin p.r.n.
6.  Multivitamins.

ALLERGIES:  Heparin causes Heparin induced thrombocytopenia.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  History of 40 pack year tobacco use.
Occasional alcohol.  Married and lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **]
retired from the [**Company 26765**].  He has a daughter
in [**Name (NI) 108**] and a son in [**Name (NI) 86**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Both brothers died of lung cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature was 95.1,
blood pressure 130/83, heart rate 140, respiratory rate 18,
oxygen saturation 100% on two liters.  In general, he is
cachectic African American male in no apparent distress.  His
head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination reveals
extraocular movements intact.  The pupils are equal, round,
and reactive to light and accommodation.  He is anicteric
with dry mucous membranes.  His neck is supple with no
jugular venous distention, no lymphadenopathy.  His chest is
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His heart is tachycardic
with normal S1 and S2 and no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  His
abdomen has normal bowel sounds, is nontender and
nondistended.  Left lower extremity is swollen and hot and
diffusely tender with pain on passive motion of the knee and
a positive Homans' sign.  There are no palpable cords.
Neurologically, cranial nerves II through XII are intact.  He
has decreased sensation in the left lower extremity with
decreased motor strength secondary to pain.  The rest of his
extremities have 5/5 strength with normal sensation.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 15.4, 70% polys, 5%
bands, 19% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, hematocrit 32.7,
platelets 112,000.  Sodium 139, potassium 5.5 (hemolyzed),
chloride 100, bicarbonate 22, blood urea nitrogen 31,
creatinine 1.9 (baseline 0.8 to 1.1), glucose 263.  INR 1.3.

Electrocardiogram - sinus tachycardia at 130 beats per minute
with normal axis and intervals, 1.[**Street Address(2) 2811**] depression
in V5 and left ventricular hypertrophy, no strain pattern.

Lower extremity noninvasives reveal no flow, compressibility
or augmentation of the left common femoral, superficial
femoral, saphenous or popliteal veins consistent with
extensive deep vein thrombosis.

Chest x-ray - evidence of right upper lobe resection,
elevated right hemidiaphragm, no congestive heart failure or
consolidations.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an unfortunate 59 year old male
with metastatic lung carcinoma with metastases to the brain
and neck and history of pulmonary embolus and malignant
pericardial effusion and tamponade two weeks prior to
admission.  He now presents with left lower extremity deep
vein thrombosis.

1.  Deep vein thrombosis - By lower extremity noninvasive,
the deep vein thrombosis was extensive.  Cardiology service
felt that the patient's recent effusion was an absolute
contraindication to anticoagulation. Therefore, the patient
was managed supportively with pain relief using M.S. Contin
and MSIR for breakthrough pain, elevation of left lower
extremity and oxygen supplementation as needed.  The patient
has an inferior vena cava filter, however, there is no
absolute certainty that the patient did not also have
pulmonary embolus.  However, as the patient was not
anticoagulable, the patient was treated supportively with
oxygen.

2.  Pericardial effusion - A bedside echocardiogram showed a
continued moderate effusion, slightly larger than the
previous echocardiogram.  Again, no anticoagulation was
indicated.

3.  Atrial fibrillation - The patient was in sinus
tachycardia.  He was briefly in rapid atrial fibrillation
secondary perhaps to pulmonary embolus.  However, he
converted spontaneously back to sinus tachycardia.  His rate
was controlled with Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.  He was
also given volume and pain control to help control his
tachycardia.

4.  Acute renal failure - The patient's creatinine rose to a
peak of 3.0.  At baseline, it is 0.9.  It was felt that this
was secondary to volume depletion from poor p.o. intake.  The
patient was also taking Indocin at home.  A renal ultrasound
showed no extension of the clot to the renal veins.  There is
also no evidence of hydronephrosis or obstruction.  The
patient was given fluid boluses for intravascular repletion.

5.  Direction of care - After extensive discussion between
the patient, his family, and his health care providers
including his primary oncologist, the patient's code status
was changed to DNR/DNI.  The patient requested home Hospice
care.  The patient is being screened for home Hospice care
and will be discharged home with home Hospice care.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is discharged home with
Hospice care.  He is to have liberal opiates for pain
control.  He will also need oxygen for hypoxia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Wellbutrin SR 150 mg p.o. q.a.m.
2.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Prednisone 10 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Reglan 10 mg p.o. t.i.d., give one half hour before
meals.
7.  M.S. Contin 30 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8.  MSIR 10 mg p.o. q4hours p.r.n. breakthrough pain.
9.  Senna two tablets p.o. q.h.s.
