History of Present Illness:
This is a 63 year old female with a history of COPD, DM II and
new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation who presents from [**Hospital1 79678**] for further cardiology evaluation of her
atrial fibrillation. She was recently discharged from The
[**Hospital3 **] ([**6-24**] to [**7-2**]) with a diagnosis of new onset
atrial fibrillation/flutter. She was seen by the cardiology
service (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] during that admission and started on
anticoagulation and antiarrhythmic therapy on amiodarone. She
has been feeling well since discharge from that hospitalization
until she was noted by her VNA this morning during routine
vitals check to have a HR to 130s.

She was initially sent to [**Hospital6 12112**], and found
to have afib with RVR to 140s (remainder of vitals T 98.5, HR
146, BP 126/76 95% RA). She was given cardizem 20 IV then
started cardizem gtt at 5mg/h then titrated to 10 mg/h. She
continued to have rapid ventricular rate to 120s and was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiology evaluation.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, patient's VS were 97.4 BP 109/75 RR 16 93% RA,
she was again noted to be in atrial flutter at 140 and was given
diltiazem 10 mg IV. Her HR persisted at 110-130s and BP
transiently down to high 90s (lowest SBP 96), per review of
EDVS, appears to spontaneously resolve. She was given 3 L of IVF
total in ED. She had a blood pressure rise to 110s at time of
admission. In addition, she was noted to have diffuse wheezing
and was treated for COPD flare with methylprednisolone 125 mg,
albuterol and atrovent nebs and levofloxacin.

She reports dyspnea on exertion that started earlier this
morning. Also reports 2 days of productive cough of yellow
sputum. Denies fevers, and chills. Also denies palpitations,
chest pain, orthopnea, and lower extremity swelling.

PERTINENT LABS/STUDIES:

WBC:  8.0 ([**7-19**]/) -> 20.4 ([**7-26**]) -> 12.5 ([**7-30**])
Hct:  Ranged between 32.0 and 38.8 during this admission

Trop: <0.01 x2
Digoxin: 0.05 -> 0.8 (subtherapeutic)

MICROBIOLOGY:
U/A ([**7-19**]): Small leukocytes, occasional bacteria.  Cx was
consistent with skin contamination.
U/A ([**7-26**]): No leukocytes, few bacteria, no blood.  Cx showed no
bacteria
CDiff Cx ([**7-28**]): Negative
BCx ([**7-19**]):  Negative
.
ECG ([**2145-7-19**]):  Atrial flutter at rate of 130, normal axis, [**Street Address(2) 11342**] depression lead II, V3-V4.

CXR ([**7-19**]): Left atrial enlargement with no pulmonary
consolidation.
.
CXR ([**7-20**]): In comparison with the study of [**7-19**], there is
little change and no definite pulmonary vascular congestion.
Although there is straightening of the left heart border and
vague suggestion of a double density behind the heart, there is
no elevation of the left main stem bronchus that is
characteristic of left atrial enlargement. Echocardiography
would be required to determine whether there is any chamber
enlargement or valvular involvement
.
CXR ([**7-24**]): In comparison with the study of [**7-20**], there is again
some
hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary
disease. No
evidence of acute focal pneumonia. Some atelectatic changes are
seen at the left base.
.
CXR ([**7-26**]):  No significant interval change. Slight decrease in
bibasilar
atelectatic regions. No evidence for pneumonia
.
ECHO ([**7-20**]): The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
63 year old female with a history of COPD and type II DM who
presents with a recent diagnosis of atrial flutter/fib found to
be with RVR and COPD exacerbation.
.
# Atrial flutter/fib: Patient was diagnosed with AFib and
AFlutter during an admission to [**Hospital 4199**] hospital in [**Month (only) **]. She
was not responsive to pharmacotherapy.  She had a TEE in the
MICU, which was negative for thrombus, and then underwent
cardioversion in the MICU.  After transfer to the floor, she
converted back into AFib.  She continued to vacillate between
AFib and NSR during her hospital stay.  She was admitted on 200
mg Amiodarone daily.  She was placed on Amiodarone 200 mg [**Hospital1 **],
Verapamil 360 mg daily, and Digoxin 0.125 mg daily, yet she
still converted back into AFib. She was thus tried on 40 mg
short-acting Verapamil TID, but this also did not put her back
into continuous NSR.  Her rate continued to remain in the 110s
to 130s despite maximal medical management, yet the patient
remained asymptomatic and was successfully ambulating in the
halls.  She was discharged on 360 mg Verapamil daily, 200 mg
Amiodarone [**Hospital1 **], 0.125 mg Digoxin daily, and a follow-up
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**8-9**].
.
# Constipation/Diarrhea: Patient had been constipated and was
given a Fleets enema on [**7-24**]. She then had an episode of
diarrhea and developed a leukocytosis to 20.2. Patient was
started on Flagyl 500 mg TID for suspected CDiff, though a
subsequent culture was negative. She had another formed BM 24
hours after ABX were started, and her leukocytosis improved.
Patient had abdominal tenderness on physical exam, which
resolved upon treatment with Flagyl.  Patient was discharged on
Flagyl 400 mg TID for a total duration of 7 days treatment for
suspected CDiff.
.
# COPD exacerbation: Patient was admitted with a COPD
exacerbation.  She was placed on Levoflox
