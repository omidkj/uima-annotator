Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 633**]
Chief Complaint:
thyrotoxicosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 20179**] is a 44F with PMH Graves' disease for the past 7
years, previously on PTU and propranolol, non-adherent on
medications for ?years, who is transferred from [**Hospital3 **]
for management of atrial fibrillation and continuing
thyrotoxicosis. She initially presented to her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**1-5**] for
SOB, dry cough. She noted that she developed SOB two days prior
to that on Weds night. At the [**Location (un) 620**] ED, she was noted to have
HR in 150s and was given metoprolol with little effect, and
placed on dilt gtt. Endocrinology was curbsided, and they
recommended PTU 100mg TID, propranolol 10mg TID. Her initial
thyroid studies showed TSH < 0.014, with free T4 >7.77 and free
T3 pending. Despite propranolol 10mg q8hr and PTU 100mg q8hr,
she required dilt gtt to keep HR controlled. Her HR improved,
but her BP was borderline at low 90s to 100s sytolic. Per notes,
thought she would require uptitration of PTU to 200mg q8hr, but
preferred to transfer for endocrinology input. She had atrial
fibrillation, attributed to thyrotoxicosis. Additionally she was
hypoxic requiring 3LNC thought to be [**1-25**] pulmonary edema. She
was not diuresed there given BP's in 90s-100s systolic.

On arrival to the ICU, her VS are T 98.6, HR 90, BP 100/75, RR
25, O2 95% 3L NC.  She feels much improved, but continues to
have SOB.  Did have 2 episodes of nausea/vomiting today. She
denies chest pain, pressure, or palpitations. She sleeps on 1
pillow at home, and denies orthopnea, PND. She said she has
always had swelling of her RLE, but has noticed over the last
both have swelling. She denies any recent weight loss or gain.
She denies fever, chills, or sweats. She denies tremors.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, or weakness. Denies diarrhea,
constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. Denies

.
EKG [**2198-1-6**]:
Atrial fibrillation. No previous tracing available for
comparison
.
CXR [**2198-1-6**]:
FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette is enlarged, and accompanied by
upper zone
vascular re-distribution. Bibasilar patchy and linear opacities
are present, accompanied by small bilateral pleural effusions.
The etiology of the basilar opacities is uncertain, particularly
in absence of older studies for comparison. Differential
diagnosis includes aspiration, pneumonia, atelectasis, and
dependent edema.
.
LENI [**1-7**];
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the right
lower
extremity.
.
EKG [**1-9**]:
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Delayed
precordial
R wave transition. Borderline low limb lead voltage. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2198-1-6**] no diagnostic interim change
.
ECHO [**2198-1-10**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is elongated.
The estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
25-30 %) due to akinesis of the inferior wall, septum and
moderate hypokinesis of the remaining segments. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. The mitral valve leaflets do not fully
coapt. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate-severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate-severe global and regional left ventricular
dysfunction. At least moderate-severe functional mitral
regurgitation. Moderate-severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
