History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD on HD MWF, CVA's, seizure
disorder with a declined mental status (A+Ox1), who is
presenting to the MICU with hypotension after dialysis. Today
during dialysis the patient became unresponsive 45 minutes into
the session with a systolic blood pressure in the 60s. She was
given 2.5L of fluids and BP responded immediately as did her
mental status. She was sent to the ED for further work-up.
.
In the ED, the patients initial vitals were 97.7, 145/59, 66,
100% on 2L NC. A finger stick blood glucose was 133. She did not
have any fevers, leukocytosis, or elevated lactate. A CXR showed
a right pleural effusion. She has a history of traumatic cardiac
tamonade during a dialysis line placement in [**7-/2197**], so a
bedside echo was performed, which did not show any signs of
tamponade. She continued to have episodes of hypotension with
systolic BP's in the 70s, which would resolve spontaneously
without fluids.

CHEST X-RAY ([**2197-9-6**])
AP BEDSIDE CHEST. The heart is upper limits of normal. There is
central
[**Month/Day/Year 1106**] congestion and interstitial edema. Small right and
probably left
effusions layering in semi-erect position with possible
superimposed right
pleural thickening. Sternal wire sutures. Left subclavian line
with tip in
mid SVC. Allowing for technical differences there is no change
from similar exam two days ago ([**2197-9-4**]).

IMPRESSION: No short interval change. CHF and/or fluid overload.



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 72F with a PMH s/f ESRD on HD, CVA with seizure
disorder and declining mental status who presented with
hypotension.
.
#. Hypotension: Occured transiently after dialysis, and
immediately responded to fluids. No fevers, leukocytosis,
lactate, tamponade physiology on echo, or signs of bleeding.
Likely a result of hypovolemia after dialysis combined with
autonomic dysreflexia. All antihypertensives were held and
midodrine was started with good response. Patient has remained
normotensive and will be discharged with this regimen. She will
need close follow up with primary renal team per D/C
instructions
.
#. Right pleural effusion: Appears chronic based on past CXRs.
Patient remained afebrile and without supplementa oxygen
requirement.
.
#. Pericardial effusion: Although prior history of this,
currently there is no tamponade physiology on bedside
echocardiogram done in the ED. No further intervention is
required.
.
#. Sacral decubitus ulcer: Chronic, noted at admission. Wound
care consult was called.
.
#. Mental status: Based on prior neuro notes, this appears to be
her baseline. Recent head CT with old strokes, and nothing acute
on [**8-30**].
.
#. ESRD: Patient tolerated HD on above regimen, defer further
management to outpatient renal team.
.
#. DM: continue home insulin regimen
.
#. CVA: Continue coumadin per outpatient regimen.
.
#. HTN: Not active as above
.
#. Seizures: continue home regimen of keppra
