Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress, Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
HPI - This is a 69 y/o Russian-speaking male with PMH
significant for metastatic renal CA to brain and lungs, s/p LLL
lobectomy, s/p TURP [**1-18**] prostate CA, colon CA s/p colectomy, who
presents to the ED from NH with respiratory distress. History is
limited by patient's non-verbal state and wife's limited
English. Per wife, patient has been in the [**Name (NI) **] since [**5-22**] [**1-18**] CVA
involving the right extremities. His mental status has been poor
at baseline and has increasingly worsened to a non-verbal state
approx one month ago. Beginning two nights ago, the patient was
noted to have some respiratory distress, requiring oxygen and
was started on Augmentin for a presumed PNA. However, his
respiratory status did not improve and was noted to have a
low-grade temp of 100.9, RR 30, HR 140, BP 155/88, SaO2 94% on
supplemental O2 (unknown amount), prompting the NH to send the
patient to the ED early this morning.
.
In the ED, he was noted to have a Tc of 103.8 (rectally), HR
134, BP 124/74, RR 42, SaO2 88%/NRB. His labs were notable for a
WBC of 27.9 (97% N, no bands) and lactate of 2. He received
combivent nebs, 1 gm tylenol pr, 500 cc of NS bolus, 1 gm
ceftaz, 500 mg IV flagyl, and 1 gm of vanc. His sats improved
while in the ED and he was weaned down to 4 L NC. ABG on 4L was
7.49/34/82/31.

Patient was admitted to the MICU and admitted on broad spectrum
antibiotics.  Discussion was held with family and patient was
made DNR/DNI/no pressors.

RENAL ULTRASOUND:
The patient is status post right nephrectomy. The left kidney
measures 13.4 cm. The calyces are mildly prominent throughout
the left kidney, however, there is no frank evidence of
hydronephrosis. No stones or masses are identified. The bladder
is catheterized and empty.
.
Video Swallow:
FINDINGS: Video oropharyngeal fluoroscopic swallowing evaluation
was performed in conjunction with speech and swallow pathology.
Patient was administered various consistencies of barium
including thin, nectar, thick, and ground cookie. Posterior oral
transit was moderately delayed. In addition, swallowing
initiation was severely impaired with significantly delayed
swallowing initiation to large boluses. When swallow was
initiated, there was some adequate epiglottic deflection, and
laryngeal valve closure. However, there was silent aspiration to
thin liquids. The patient had difficulties following commands
during the examination, and would not take cookie or straw.
IMPRESSION: Severe swallow initiation delay with aspiration to
thins. For further details, please consult the speech and
swallow pathology note.
.
CT Head:
CLINICAL INDICATION: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma with
somnolence, assess for intracranial hemorrhage.
There is a large hyperdense lesion involving the left frontal
lobe near the convexity measuring 4.2 x 4 cm and surrounded by
vasogenic edema, with mass effect seen over the left lateral
ventricle. There is minimal midline shift to the right. The
edema extends inferiorly into the left frontoparietal white
matter and the left temporal lobe. The ventricular system is not
dilated. There is no intraparenchymal or subdural hemorrhage.
The fourth ventricle remains in the midline. There is
heterogeneous hyperdense lesion abutting the right frontal
aspect of the calvarium along the midline. This could represent
volume averaging. No lytic lesions are identified. Chronic
mucosal thickening is seen within the paranasal sinuses.
.
IMPRESSION: 4-cm hyperdense necrotic mass lesion involving the
left frontal lobe surrounded by significant vasogenic edema and
associated with sulcal effacement and surrounding mass effect as
noted above. This is most likely metastatic in nature given the
history of renal cell cancer. No intraparenchymal hemorrhage was
seen.
.
CT Chest:
Multidetector CT of the chest was performed without intravenous
or oral contrast administration. Images are presented for
display in the axial plane at both 5-mm and 1.25-mm collimation.
.
There is near complete opacification of the remaining portion of
the left lung with only a small amount of residual aerated lung
at the apical portion. Assessment of the central airways
demonstrates complete obstruction of the left main bronchus just
beyond its origin. The contents within the obstructed bronchus
range from fluid to soft tissue attenuation. Superiorly, there
are some areas of consolidation and ground-glass superimposed
upon underlying areas of emphysema, but beginning in the mid
portion of the left lung, opacified lung is relatively
homogeneous without air bronchograms. An area of curvilinear
calcification is present in the lower left hemithorax
posteriorly and there are surgical clips present in the
paraaortic and perihilar regions.
.
The left lobe of the thyroid gland is markedly enlarged and
heterogeneous. The superior portion of the enlarged lobe is not
completely imaged on this scan, and it is difficult to exclude
adjacent areas of lymphadenopathy in the left neck as well. The
enlarged thyroid gland results in rightward displacement and
coronal narrowing of the trachea which is narrowed to
approximately 8 mm at the thoracic inlet level. There is bulky
mediastinal lymphadenopathy on both sides of midline, with the
right paratracheal lymph node measuring up to 3.6 x 2.7 cm and a
left prevascular node measuring up to 2.5 x 3.0 cm. A bulky left
lower paratracheal lymph node measures 3.1 x 2.0 cm. The left
hilum is difficult to assess without intravenous contrast but
there is
