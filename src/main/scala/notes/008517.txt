Briefly, 64M with h/o lung ca s/p left pneumonectomy ([**2125**],
unknown CA), more recently had w/u of recurrent R lung mass
(unrevealing medisastinoscopy and paraceliac LN biopsy ([**7-17**]) at
[**Hospital1 112**].
.
[**2138-1-12**] [Floor]: Pt presented ED on [**2139-1-12**] for with productive
cough, low grade temps, worsening dyspnea, and tachypnea.
Treated with Levo/Clinda for post-obstructive RLL PNA>
.
[**Date range (1) 23890**] [Floor, ICU, Floor, Bronch, ICU]: CT scan revealed
R hilar cavitating mass with evidence of tree and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities
of the right lung. Pt subsequently tachypnea to 30s and
transfered to MICU Green. Clinda/Levo was changed to PCN to
treat for actinomyces. Pt subsequently called back out to floor
and underwent Bronch that showed near occlusion of the RUL
bronchus by  mass and endobronchial bx and transbronchial FNA
performed. Pt desatted to 80% and remained intubated, transfered
back to the MICU.
.
[**Date range (1) 23891**]: [ICU] Pt placed on Levophed. On [**1-18**] underwent
repeat Chest CT and started on Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro. Pt given
increasing doses of IV Lasix and later placed on Dobutamine to
assist with diuresis. ([**1-19**]) Micafungin, Flaygl added as PCN and
Cipro d/c'd. ([**1-20**]) Vanc d/c'd as the pt underwent a rigid/flex
bronch that revealed poorly differentiated NSCLC. Today the
patient was consulted by Heme-Onc where numerous options were
presented to the patient (XRT, chemo). The pt initially decided
against XRT, but later reversed his decision and is now being
transfered to the [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] to undergo XRT. Prior to transfer
the pt was hypotensive, started back on Levophed and given IV
Bolus.
.
ROS: congestion, sore throat, chest pain, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena,
hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.

CT chest:  [**2139-1-13**]
1. Right lower lobe cavitary mass, with associated right hilar
bulky
lymphadenopathy, highly concerning for recurrent bronchogenic
malignancy.
Either the right lower lobe mass, or multiple stations of
lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum would be amenable to
bronchoscopic biopsy.
  2. Extensive peribronchiolar tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, small
nodular and
ground-glass opacities throughout the right upper lobe, and to a
lesser degree in the right middle and lower lobes. Findings
suggest a superimposed infectious process. Infection involving
the cavitary mass in the right lower lobe superior segment could
also be considered, along with superinfection of a preexisting
cavitary mass.
  3. Subtle thickening of interlobular septae in portions of the
right upper lobe and superior segment right lower lobe,
worrisome for lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
  4. Necrotic-appearing 3 cm left adrenal nodule and enlarged
1.6 cm left
paraaortic node worrisome for metastatic disease.
  5. Secretions and debris in the left mainstem bronchial stump
may be acting as a nidus for infection.

Cytology:
Right main stem mass, transbronchial needle aspirate: ATYPICAL.
Clusters of atypical stripped nuclei and focal necrosis in a
background of reactive bronchial epithelial cells, (see note.)
    Note: The atypical nuclei are stripped of their cytoplasm
and display regular nuclear contours, vesicular chromatin and
large prominent nucleoli. Please also refer to the concurrent
endobronchial biopsy S10-964.
Right mainstem bronchus, endobronchial biopsy: Poorly
differentiated carcinoma

TTE:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure overload. The aortic
root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion

[**2139-1-18**]:
  1. No evidence of endoluminal filling defects to indicate
pulmonary embolus.  However, multiple areas of progressive
narrowing and at least one occlusion of pulmonary arterial
branches by the infiltrative right hilar mass likely contribute
to the described symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
  2.Interval development of multiple foci of consolidation and
peribronchiolar opacities in the right middle and upper lobe
concerning for progressive multifocal pneumonia. Findings were
called to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
  3. Mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion.
  4. Diffuse adenopathy and infiltrative mass involving the
right middle and upper lobe with progressive obstruction of the
bronchi and pulmonary
vasculature.
  5. Changes of left pneumonectomy.
  6. Enhancing nodule with central hypodensity adjacent to or
within the left adrenal gland is consistent with either
metastatic involvement of lymph node or adrenal gland.

[**2139-1-20**] Pathology:
Right bronchus intermedius mass (for frozen section),
endobronchial biopsy (A): Poorly differentiated carcinoma.
Right bronchus intermedius mass, endobronchial biopsy (B):
Poorly differentiated carcinoma.
