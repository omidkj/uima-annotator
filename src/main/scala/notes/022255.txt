History of Present Illness:
CC:[**CC Contact Info 15943**].
HPI: Patient is a 63 yo female with logn standing h/o ischemic
CM, EF 20-25% on chronic dopamine, mechanical MVR, h/o UBIB and
AVM, presents from [**Hospital1 **] with GI bleed and BRBPR times [**12-22**]
days. Patient reports brown stool with BRBPR and bright blood in
toilet bowel. Patient also had nause and vomited times 1 today
that was clear. Patient's HCT dropped to 15.3, (24-29) and BP
80/40,and patient sent to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, on NS at 200cc/Hr. In
the ED, patient not complaining of dizziness, weakness, CP, SOB
and SBPs in 80s (baseline 90s). Patient also reporting no
melena, coffee ground emesis, and pain. Patient ordered for 1U
FFP and 1U Blood, 5 mg Vit K, and GI consulted. Patient admitted
to the MICU. Patient also seen by GI in the ED.  Patient was
transfused 4U PRBC and 3U FFP and Dopa increased to 16 from
baseline of 8.

Patient had a right ankle fracture in [**2130-8-19**], S/P I&D and
[**Last Name (un) **] on [**2130-11-22**] for an exposed ORIF site. She was discharged to
complete a 6 week course of Augmentin after her I&D and [**Last Name (un) **].
Patient dcd her Augmentin [**12-21**] diarrhea and readmitted on [**2130-12-5**]
with CP. She was restarted on vancomycin and unasyn to complete
a 6 week course ending  on [**2131-1-16**]. She was also continued
on a wound vac during  hospitalization and followed by the
orthopaedics service. Prior to discharge, her wound vac was
D/C'ed and she was changed to
wet-to-dry dressings, per recommendations by orthopaedics
discharge. Four of four bottles were also positive for [**Female First Name (un) **]
parapsilosis. She was emperically started on ambisome at 5
mg/kg. Surveillance cultures were drawn daily, and remained
positive through [**12-4**]. Subsequent cultures were negative.
Given her high grade fungemia, there was concern for seeding of
her mechanical mitral valve. TEE on [**2130-12-12**] which showed a clean
prosthetic valve (results detailed above). Her right PICC line
was also exchanged for a left PICC line, placed by
interventional radiology. She was evaluated by ophthalmology and
ruled out for endophthalmitis. She also had a right upper
extremity doppler to rule out septic thrombus. She was changed
from IV ambisome to PO fluconazole, to complete a course ending

on [**2131-1-2**].

Patient was also ruled out for MI and remained stable in terms
of her CHF and anticogulation .

Currently no complains of pain, nausea, vomiting, CP, SOB or
other complaints.  She is still having dark stool in rectal tube
output.

Pertinent Results:
TEE ([**2130-12-12**]): [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 6878**], complex (>4mm) non-mobile atheroma in
the aortic arch and simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
without discrete vegetation. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
A well-seated bileaflet mechanical mitral valve prosthesis is
present. The motion of the mitral valve prosthetic leaflets
appears normal. There is a very mild paravalvular leak. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 69 yo female with h/o ischemic CM, s/p pacer, mechanical
MVR, h/o upper GIB, and recent ORIF complicated by fungemia,
presents with GIB without clear source.
.
1. GIB:  She had a bleeding study on [**12-21**] that was negative for
lower GI bleed.  Her EGD on [**2130-12-22**] showed no source of bleed,
normal esophagus, and slight mosaic appearance of stomach
mucosa.  She continued to have dark stool in her rectal tube.
Her Hct was initially stable, but dropped again.  Colonoscopy
was done on [**2130-12-24**], with no source of bleeding identified.  She
was maintained on heparin for her MVR.  She received a total of
8U PRBC and 3U FFP.  She had no further episodes of melena or
BRBPR, and her Hct remained stable at 30.0.  She was restarted
on Coumadin, to be titrated at rehab.
.
2. Ischemic CM and CHF:  Ruled out for MI.  No evidence of CHF
exacerbation.  She was continued on her dopamine gtt as per home
regimen. Primary cardiologist, Dr [**First Name (STitle) 437**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] try to wean in
future.  She was continued on spironolactone and furosemide.
Her carvediolol and enalapril were initially held for concern
for hypotension.  They were added back and tolerated well, to be
titrated by PCP and cardiologist.  She appeared euvolemic on
discharge.
.
3. Afib/flutter: She was stable s/p ablation on amiodarone and
with AVpacer.  Her  carvedilol was later restarted.
.
4. Osteomyelitis:  S/p I&D and [**Last Name (un) **] on [**2130-11-22**] for exposed ORIF
site.  Ortho following, walk boot in place.  She was continued
on vancomycin and amp/sulbactam, planned for a 6-week course.
She has follow up with ID on [**2131-1-16**].
.
5. Candidemia: [**Female First Name (un) 564**] parapsilosis on [**12-1**], likely source R
PICC, which was discharged.  Ophtho eval showed no
endophthalmitis and TTE on [**12-11**] showed no definite vegetation.
Stable on fluconazole, to complete a 4 week course through
[**2131-1-2**] per ID recs.
.
6. DM: Stable on humalog sliding scale. ACE-inhibitor restarted
once BP stable.
