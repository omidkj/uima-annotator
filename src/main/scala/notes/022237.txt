Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2474**]
Chief Complaint:
Decreased urine output, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
62 year old male with multiple medical problems significant for
b/l fibrothoraces s/p lung decortication in [**2-3**], diastolic CHF
(EF 55%), NSTEMI in setting of urosepsis in [**2139**], and 2 recent
admissions for urosepsis and CHF/PNA, who presents from home
with decreased urine output, chest pressure and SOB. He reports
that since discharge 5 days ago his shortness of breath has
gotten progressively worse. He denies orthopnea and says that
his breathing is actually better when slightly reclined. He also
says his LE edema is less than it has been.
.
He noted the decreased urine output yesterday, despite the
presence of a foley. Denies any hematuria.
.
He also complains of a chest pressure/tightness, substernal,
which does have some positional component and some association
to breathing. It's [**4-11**] at it's worst and is not associated with
N/V/D.
.
In the ED this admission, his initial BP was 126, however
dropped to the 80s. He received 2L IVF without improvement in
his BP, and was started on peripheral dopamine. Initial labs
were notable for ARF with creatinine 3.8, a BNP of 32,800, and a
UA with 11-20 wbc, many bacteria, positive LE. Lactate 1.6. Bcx,
Ucx sent. CXR showed ?PNA in LLL and CHF. Given one dose of
ceftriaxone and sent to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on peripheral dopamine.
.
2 recent admissions: First from [**Date range (1) 34884**] with presumed
urosepsis s/p penile implant surgery. He required levophed, and
was treated with Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone, though urine and
blood cultures were negative; vancomycin was discontinued, and
he was discharged home on a 7 day course of PO cefpodoxime. A
foley was left in place, as he was unable to void. This
admission was also complicated by acute on chronic renal
failure, with Cr increase to 4.3 (baseline 1.6) atributed to his
hypotension. It was 2.1 on discharge. He had elevated (max 0.29)
but decreasing troponins but no chest pain or ST changs, and he
was thought to have demand ischemia.
.
He was readmitted on [**2148-11-17**] with chest pressure, found to
have LLL PNA and CHF. He was diuresed with IV lasix and treated
for pneumonia with levaquin. Of note, he was discharged on home
O2 secondary to desaturation with ambulation. He continued to
have urinary retention during this admission and was again
discharged with a foley.

not smoke. Only minimal ethanol. Otherwise, he is extremely
sedentary.


Family History:

Breast [**Name (NI) 3730**] - mother
emphysema - father

Physical Exam:
PE: 98.6, 89/36, 68, 19, 93% on 3L.
Gen: Overweight caucasian male wearing BIPAP mask, appearing
comfortable, communicative.
HEENT: Anicteric sclerae, BIPAP in place.
Neck: Unable to locate JVP secondary to body habitus.
Cor: RR, normal rate, no m/r/g.
Lungs: B/L rales about 1/3 up from the bases, decreased breath
sounds at L base with dullness to percussion.
Abd: NABS, subcutaneous nodules, NT/ND, oblique scar in RUQ.
Extr: Trace to 1+ pitting edema of LE b/l.
Genitals: Penile implant in place, erythematous and edematous
penile shaft, yellow exudate on gauze coming from inferior

Pertinent Results:
EKG: NSR at 70 bpm, normal intervals, normal axis, Q in III, TWI
in V2-V5, no ST segment changes.
.
CXR [**11-27**]: IMPRESSION: Probable mild CHF. Bibasilar atelectasis.
However, an early pneumonic infiltrate cannot be excluded.
Pleural fluid versus thickening along left lateral chest wall.
Probable small pleural effusions. Please note that these
findings may be exaggerated to some degree due to low
inspiratory volumes.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypotension: Patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where he was
treated with pressors including dopamine for his hypotension.
His blood pressure medications were held.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test was
performed and was normal.  He was noted to have a urinary tract
infection on admission, as well as infiltrate at his left lung
base on CXR.  He was started on Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone.
There was some concern for sepsis, especially in light of the
patient's recent penile implant surgery.  Urology was consulted
and they felt that the surgical site was healing well without
signs of infection.  They recommended foley placement as they
thought the patient's hypotension was likely secondary to mild
urinary retention.  They also recommended re-starting Proscar
and Flomax.  Patient was weaned off pressors and continued to
have hypotension responsive to fluid boluses.  Given that the
patient remained essentially afebrile after admission, with no
leukocytosis and negative blood cultures, it was deemed highly
unlikley that the pateint was in septic shock.  Given his
response to fluid boluses, there was some though the hypotension
was a result of over diuresis at home, possibly complicated by
overuse of narcotics for his recent surgery.  He was transferred
to the [**Company 191**] service and continued to do well except for
persistent penile pain secondary to surgery.  He had a few
episodes of sharp chest pain, reproducible with palpation, which
he described as different from his anginal chest pain.  There
were no associated symptoms and no ECG changes when one was
obtained immediately after an episode of pain.  Pain was well
controlled with PRN percocet.  Patient failed a voiding trial
and was discharged home in stable condition with his foley
catheter still in place.

.
2. Troponin elevation: Up to .21, from .11 on [**11-17**] in the
setting of urosepsis. Given that his CK was flat and there were
no ECG changes, the troponin elevation was attributed to chronic
wall stretch from CHF with impaired troponin clearance in the
setting of ARF.

.
3. Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine was 3.8 on admission.  FeNa
was consistent with pre-renal etiology and resolved with fluids.
 Recent baseline appears to be around 1.4-1.7. His urine output
transiently declined while in the unit, then returned to [**Location 213**].
 Tamulosin was increased per urology recs.
.
4. Hypoxia, ?hypoventilation: Unclear how much of the hypoxia is
secondary to PNA versus CHF. Also some concern for
hypoventilation from OSA. The picture is further compliated by
the patient's fibrothorax s/p decortication. Bipap was continued
for for OSA.  Lasix was re-started at a low dose.  Hypoxia
improved but with intermittent oxygen saturation levels below
90, especially with ambulation, patient was dicharged on home
oxygen.
.
5. DM: That patient's normal dose of lantus 8U QHS was continued
with a RISS for stict glucose control.
.
6. Anemia: This is a chronic problem.  Patient's baseline
earlier this year was in the mid-30s, however more recently
around 3
