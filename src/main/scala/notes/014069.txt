Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known firstname 11894**] [**Known lastname 10029**] is a 60-year-old woman with a pmhx of breast
cancer, IgG deficiency, and hyperfibrinolysis syndrome who
presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with a tooth abscess.  Due to Ms.
[**Known lastname **] numerous allergies to medication, it was necessary for
her to receive IV antibiotics for the abscess; moreover, in
light of her bleeding disorder, it was best that she be
evaluated for oral surgery in an inpatient setting.
.
Tooth abscess/infection:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was discovered to have tooth
abscesses on XRAY at her dentist's office; she has suffered from
poor dentition for a long time.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] dentist recommended
that she have her teeth extracted as well as receive antibiotics
for the infection.  However, due to Ms. [**Known lastname **] multiple drug
allergies, she was unable to take any appropriate medications by
mouth.  (Of note, her allergies are all severe, ranging from
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Syndrome to anaphylaxis).  Patient was admitted
to the hospital and started on vanc and gent; she was
pre-medicated with benadryl and hydrated with IVF prior to vanc
administration due to prior minor side effects and a tendency to
self-diureis.  Patient had no serious adverse effects from this
regimen and her creatinine remained normal despite gent
administration.  ID was consulted early on in hospital admission
and recommended starting flagyl for anearobic coverage.
However, as patient had had reactions to flagyl in the past, she
was transferred to the MICU were she was placed on a special
desensitization protocol for flagyl.  She did well and was
transferred back to the floor.
.
Patient eventually had her teeth extracted by oral surgeon Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2866**] on [**7-19**].  She received Amicar during surgery as bleeding
prophylaxis due to hyperfibrinolysis syndrome; however, after
surgery, patient appeared to be bleeding excessively (she kept
complaining of blood dripping down her throat) and she was
transferred to the MICU for observation on the night of [**7-19**].
She was readmitted to the floor on [**7-20**] in stable condition.
She was continued on IV vanc, gent, and flagyl for 5 more days
until [**7-23**].  Again, she had minor side effects wtih these
antibiotics (coughing, itchy eyes, auto-diuresis) but nothing
life-threatening.  Patient had some bleeding and bruising but
hct remained stable throughout admission.  She was eventually
transitioned to oral amicar; however, she was was not sent home
on this medication.  Patient was discharged home in stable
condition; she was exhausted from her lengthy hospital stay and
still recovering from the oral surgery, but Ms. [**Known lastname 10029**] was doing
well overall.
.
Hyperfibrinolysis syndrome:  Patient is followed at the heme/onc
clinic at [**Hospital1 18**].  She has been seen in the past by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2805**].
.
IgG:  Patient is managed by heme/onc and her PCP for this
condition.  Her PCP is considering referring Ms. [**Known lastname 10029**] to an
allergist for allergen testing a
