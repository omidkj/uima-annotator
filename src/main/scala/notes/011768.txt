HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Miss [**Known lastname 36705**] is an 80-year-old
female with multiple medical problems who was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] from [**Hospital 8641**] hospital in
[**Location (un) 3844**] for management of her GI bleeding.  The patient
is a resident of [**Hospital 2670**] Nursing Home in [**Location (un) 8641**], [**Location (un) 7498**], who presented to her local community hospital with
melenic stool.  In the hours preceding admission to the
community hospital, the patient was evidently poorly
responsive and appeared ill enough that the family and staff
expected her to expire.  Ultimately they debated pros and
cons of allowing transport to the hospital and the husband
consented to have her brought to the hospital with the idea
that comfort measures would take priority.  Upon admission
the patient was treated conservatively with intravenous
fluids and packed red blood cells.  In addition, her do not
resuscitate was continued.  The patient was evaluated by
gastroenterology who performed both an upper endoscopy and a
sigmoidoscopy that demonstrated no obvious source of
bleeding.  She did have a tag red blood cell scan that
evidently demonstrated bleeding from the area of the right
colon.  After further discussions with the family, the
patient was apparently transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for angiography and possibly vasopressin
therapy to control her gastrointestinal bleeding.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Gastrointestinal bleed secondary to
diverticular disease, anemia, coronary artery disease with a
history of MI, history of atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's
dementia with oral dyspraxia, depression, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, questionable history of TIA.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Notable for status post CABG in [**2140**],
status post left carotid endarterectomy in [**2140**], status post
TAH BSO, status post bilateral mastectomy secondary to
fibrocystic disease, kidney stone removal.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was noted to be a
pleasant, elderly female who was sleepy but easily arousable.
Heart had a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Chest had coarse breath sounds bilaterally. She was
clear to auscultation.  Abdomen was soft with quiet bowel
sounds.  She was nontender, non distended.  Her extremities
were without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.

MEDICATIONS:  At the nursing home she receives the following
medicines:  Iron, Erythromycin eye ointment, Morphine prn,
Nitroglycerin prn, Pravachol 30 mg q day, Coumadin which is
currently being held, Aspirin which is currently being held,
Digoxin 0.25 mg po q day, Prinivil 5 mg po q day, Aricept 5
mg po q day, Lasix 80 mg po q day, Ritalin 5 mg po q day,
potassium 20 mEq po bid, Multivitamin, B complex.
Questionably allergic to Pepcid.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2144-8-13**] the patient was transferred to
the medicine team at [**Hospital1 69**]
from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital for continued management of her GI
bleed.  At [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital she had required 10 units of
packed red blood cells and 4 units of FFP.  Her Coumadin and
Aspirin had been discontinued.  She had had multiple tests
including upper endoscopy and colonoscopy that revealed
diverticulosis with no obvious source of bleeding and a red
blood scan remarkable for a source of bleeding in the right
lower quadrant.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital3 **]
with the idea of having angiography and possible vasopressin
therapy.  On the second day of the patient's hospitalization
she was taken to the angiography suite for vascular imaging
of her gastrointestinal tract and vasopressin infusion.  The
family understood that the vasopressin infusion to be
administered in the absence of acute extravasation was not
standard therapy and that the patient would require a
concomitant Nitroglycerin drip as she has a positive cardiac
history.  Family also understood that this was an unusual
approach and is likely not done at other facilities.  Given
that the patient had failed conservative therapy and the
blood loss was too frequent to permit pure observation, plan
was made to admit the patient to the medical ICU and initiate
vasopressin therapy under intensive cardiac monitoring.
Therefore, patient was taken to the angiography suite where
the interventional radiology team performed a mesenteric
angiogram and initiated an intra-arterial vasopressin
therapy. She had a diverticular bleed that was identified and
treated with vasopressin of 0.1 mcg/min.  However, while the
patient was in the interventional radiology suite, rebleeding
was observed and her vasopressin dose had to be increased to
0.2 units per minute.  During this time she did receive
intravenous Nitroglycerin to protect her myocardium and she
was observed for signs and symptoms of both mesenteric and
cardiac ischemia.  At the time of angiography, it appeared
that patient's GI hemorrhage was controlled with the
intra-arterial vasopressin and it was continued at 0.15 units
per minute followed by decrease to 0.1 unit per minute to be
continued through the night.  By the patient's third hospital
day her vasopressin was discontinued.  During this time she
had required a transfusion with a total of 5 units packed red
blood cells.  The patient was observed over the following
hospital days for any evidence of re-bleeding.  Over the
ensuing days the patient's hematocrit continued to trend
downward and after she had been transferred from the Medical
Intensive Care Unit she was observed to have another episode
of melena.  The patient was still without a clear source of
bleeding and for this reason her upper endoscopy was
repeated, revealing only gastritis.  She had another tag red
blood cell scan demonstrating bleeding that appeared to
originate from the right colon.  The interventional radiology
team re-evaluated her, noted that the bleeding appeared
similar to the tag red blood cell scan obtained at [**Hospital 8641**]
Hospital and likely represented a recurrent diverticular
bleed in the region of the cecum or proximal ascending colon.
They concluded that the interventional radiology therapeutic
options included embolization or vasopressin treatment,
however, due to the patient's extensive atherosclerotic
mesenteric disease, she was not a candidate for transcatheter
embolization as it put her at an unacceptable risk for bowel
infarction.  In addition, repeat vasopressin therapy was also
felt to be very high risk due to her cardiac status and that
her first treatment proved to be unsuccessful.  At this point
it was felt that the only viable option was surgical
intervention.  Cardiology team was asked to evaluate her
preoperatively.  They acknowledged that she was a high risk
surgical candidate and recommended that she be started on
intravenous Lopressor for its cardioprotective effects.  In
addition, they recommended that her Digoxin be continued,
that she be prophylaxed with antibiotics against bacterial
endocarditis and that close monitoring be implemented to
assess her fluid balance peri and postoperatively.  On
[**2144-8-21**], the 8th day of the patient's hospitalization, she
was taken to the operating room for a right colectomy.  The
procedure itself was relatively unremarkable.
Intraoperatively she did have a central line that was placed
along with a Swan Ganz catheter, and the patient's do not
resuscitate status was revoked for the 48 hours following
surgery.  Patient's postoperative course was relatively
unremarkable.  On the first postoperative day her nasogastric
tube was discontinued.  By the second postoperative day we
were able to discontinue both her Swan Ganz catheter and her
arterial line.  During this time she did resume do not
resuscitate status after discussions with the family.  A
Digoxin level was drawn revealing a level of 2.3 which is
high, so her Digoxin was held for one day followed by
re-institution of therapy at a lower dose of 0.125 mg po q
day.  In addition, the patient did have some perioperative
EKG changes including inverted T waves in leads V1 and V2.
For this reason the patient was ruled out
