Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Increasing Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
71-year-old woman with advanced end-stage ischemic
cardiomyopathy with severe left ventricular contractile function
with LVEF of 10%, atrial fibrillation, [**Hospital1 **]-V ICD, CKD, with past
history of DVT, PE on Coumadin who presents with increasing
dyspnea. The patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] CCU on
[**9-22**] for CHF exacerbation and was discharged to rehab facility.
Since that time, patient was hospitalized at [**Location (un) **] two weeks
ago for pneumonia.

The patient reports that over the past week, the patient has had
increasing dyspnea with exertion. At baseline, patient is unable
to perform ADLs without the assistance of physical therapy. Over
the past week, there has been a noticible worsening in her
physical limitations. The patient recently saw Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] as an
outpatient and had her dose of Torsemide increased from 20mg to
40mg and Carvedilol was discontinued and switched to Metoprolol
tartrate 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].

Patient was taken to [**Hospital **] hospital for initial evaluation and
was given another dose of torsemide 40mg x 1 and then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as her cardiac care is here. Patient's
initial VS in the ED were 98.3 76 105/70 16 96 on 4LNC. Pt was
initially dyspneic, RR in 20s, wheezes bilaterally. Ascities
worse than in past few weeks. 2+ pedal edema.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for presence of chest pain
at rehab, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema. No palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

.
EKG: [**2179-10-26**] 0003: V Paced at 69, w/ RAD, bifascicular block.
.
TTE [**10-26**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with anterior, septal and apical akinesis, as well as akinesis
of the distal inferior wall (proximal LAD distribution). There
is mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF = 15-20%).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate
([**12-18**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Severe [4+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe regional systolic
dysfunction, c/w an extensive prior LAD infarction. Dilated
right ventricle with severe systolic dysfunction. Mild to
moderate mitral regurgitation. Severe tricuspid regurgitation.
At least mild pulmonary hypertension.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-5-26**],
severity of tricuspid regurgitation has increased. The other
findings are similar.
.
RLE US [**10-26**]: No right lower extremity DVT.
ABD DOPPLER [**10-26**]:
1. Distended hepatic veins and ascites, the constellation of
findings can be seen in the setting of congestive heart failure.
Otherwise, normal Doppler examination of the liver.
.
2. No evidence of biliary pathology.
.
MYOCARDIAL VIABILITY STUDY [**10-27**]:
Within limitation of current study, fixed defects in distal
anterior
and apical walls are consistent with scarring. Improvement of
inferior wall defect with correction is suggestive of myocardial
viability.
.
LHC/RHC [**11-2**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
one vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically
apparent disease. The LAD had mild instent restenosis of the
prior
stent. The LCx had no angiographically apparent disease. The RCA
was
occluded and similar to prior.
2. Resting hemodynamics on milrinone therapy revealed moderately

elevated right and left sided filling pressures with an RVEDP of
15 mmHg
and PCWP of 20 mmHg. There was moderate pulmonary hypertension
with a
PASP of 42/20 mmHg. There was normal systemic blood pressure
with
central pressure of 108/63 mmHg. There was a low-normal cardiac
index of
2.1 L/min/m2. There was no transaortic valve gradient on careful

pullback from LV to aorta.
3. Peripheral angiography revealed patent renal arteries
bilaterally.
.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
4. Normal systemic pressure.
5. Low-normal cardiac index.
6. Patent renal arteries.
.
KUB [**11-2**]:
1. There is no ileus or small bowel obstruction.
2. Tubular radiopaque left paraspinal structure of unknown
etiology warrants repeat AP and lateral radiograph.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
71-year-old woman with advanced end-stage ischemic
cardiomyopathy with severe left ventricular contractile function
with LVEF of 10%-15%, atrial fibrillation, [**Hospital1 **]-V ICD, low cardiac
output state, chronic kidney disease with past history of DVT,
PE on Coumadin.

#. NYHA Class 4 Systolic congestive Heart Failure, EF 15%. with
severe volume overloaded on examination on admission.  She had a
low output state with known low EF and dilated ischemic
cardiomyopathy.  It was felt that she would likely need
inotropic support and she was sent to the CCU for diuresis with
milrinone gtt + lasix gtt + metolazone.  The patient had
significant diuresis on this regime
