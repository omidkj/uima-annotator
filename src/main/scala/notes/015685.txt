History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a very nice 48 YO [**Known lastname 8230**]-speaking gentleman
with NSCLC, Chronic HBV, h/o positive PPD coming with productive
cough and fever. He received his routine chemotherapy on
[**2115-4-23**] of his cycle 6, day 1 of taxotere. He was in his
prior state of health until around Friday ~2-3 days ago when he
noticed subjective fever, prodcutive cough with yellowish sputum
and worsening shortness of breath. His wife reports noticing
that he also was cold/chills starting a few days prior to the
fever. He took his temperature on the day of admission and found
it to be 101.4 F. He acknowledges chest pain only with cough,
some difficulty urinating and occassional low leg pain which has
been assoicated w/getting his chemo therapy. He denies any sick
contacts, palpitations, dizziness, abdominal pain, sore throat,
otalgia, joint pains or skin rashes. Of note, he is
chemo/radiation therapy for lung cancer and is schueduled for
his next session next week.
.
In the ED his initial VS were: T 98.1 F, HR 128, BP 112/73 mmHg,
RR 20 X', SpO2 98%RA. On exam he was tachypneic, mentating well
with difficult exam in the lungs with poor air movement. He had
labs that showed WBC 6.5, HCT 40.1, PLTs 281, Na 136, K 4.2, Cl
99, CO2 24, BUN 18, creat 0.9, gluc 133, Lactate:2.5. Blood
cultures were drawn. CXR showed new RLL consolidates compatible
with PNA and stable masses in RUL and RML. Throught his stay int
he ED he spiked up to 103 and received Tylenol and Vanco and
Cefepime as well as a dose of hydrocort. He underwent CVL
placement (RIJ). He initially received 4 L NS without much
improvement in blood pressure and therefore was admitted to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. His VS prior to transfer are: 93 30 87/56 100.3. Access:
20 G. RIJ
.
On the floor, VS were 95.6 HR 84 110/81 RR 25 97% RA. Pt was not
using accessory muslces, generally appeared ill but not toxic.
Pt's BP had returned to baseline BP after IVF and levophed was
turned off. Pt denied pain currently. Noted he only had pain
w/cough but was not currently coughing.

Imaging:
CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2115-5-5**] 5:58 AM
FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Again seen is the large
right upper lobe and right middle lobe masses consistent with
known cancer. Multiple other small nodules are also seen
throughout the right lung including the right lower lobe,
unchanged. An area of increased subtle density at the right
lower lobe base appears slightly more prominent when compared to
the recent scout radiographs of the chest CT of [**2115-3-29**],
even given differences in technique. There is a small
right-sided pleural effusion, stable. The left lung remains
clear.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large right upper lobe and right middle lobe masses with
small pulmonary nodules noted in the left lower lobe. Stable
small right-sided pleural effusion.
2. Although comparison to the recent chest CT is difficult given
differences in technique, an area of increased subtle opacity at
the right lung base could potentially represent an early
pneumonia.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2115-5-5**] 3:47 PM
CT CHEST: MDCT imaging was performed from the thoracic inlet to
the upper
abdomen after the uneventful intravenous administration of
contrast. Sagittal and coronal reformats were prepared.
COMPARISON: Chest radiograph [**2115-5-5**], CT chest [**2115-3-29**].
FINDINGS: In the right upper lobe is a 7.6 x 7.2 x 7.6 cm mass,
which has
increased in size since the previous examination. There is
increased
ground-glass opacity in the periphery of this mass (2:17). This
mass extends medially, invading into the mediastinum and causing
obliteration of the right upper lobe apical bronchi, unchanged.
The azygos vein is obliterated as well as the pulmonary artery
supplying the right upper lobe, stable. Within the right middle
lobe is a 5.8 x 3.6 cm mass, increased in size since the prior
examina
