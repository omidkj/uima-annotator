Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation. Placement of PICC line. Placement of arterial line.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old female with a history of type II
diabetes, hypertension, morbid obesity and chronic dyspnea who
presents to the emergency room with a one month history of
worsening dyspnea on exertion. Her dyspnea has not been
associated with chest pain, fevers, chills, cough, or other
symptoms. Per her family she has been told that she has gained
60 lbs in the past 2 months for unclear reasons. She has been
seen in pulmonary clinic in the past for her dyspnea, most
recently in [**2173**]. At that time she was requiring home oxygen of
unclear amounts. Her dyspnea at that time was considered to be
multifactorial with a large component of obesity hypoventilation
syndrome, mild pulmonary hypertension and diastolic heart
failure. BIPAP was suggested at that time but it is unclear if
this was started. She has subsequently been lost to pulmonary
followup.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T: 96.5 P: 73 BP: 109/86 R: 18 O2
sat 68 % on RA which improved to 96% on 2L nasal canula after a
nebulizer treatement. She had a CXR which showed no acute
cardiopulmonary process and cardiomegaly. She received two
liters of normal saline, solumedrol 125 mg IV x 1, ceftriaxone 1
gram IV x 1, azithromycin 500 mg IV x 1, lasix 20 mg IV x 1,
aspirin 325 mg PO x 1. Her ABGs were significant for profound
hypercarbia which was unresponsive to a trial of non-invasive
ventilation and she was intubated. Peak pressures were elevated
peri-intubation in the 40s to 50s and this improved with
increased sedation and bronchodilators. She was transferred to
the MICU.
.
On arrival to the MICU she is intubated and sedated. No further
history can be obtained.

heavily until [**2172**]. No known alcohol or drug use. No history of
asbestos exposure. No history of tuberculosis exposure.

[**2176-11-9**] EKG
Sinus rhythm with baseline artifact. Compared to the previous
tracing
of [**2173-1-26**] artifact is more pronouned. Precordial T wave
inversions have
resolved.

[**2176-11-9**] CXR
As compared to the previous radiograph, an endotracheal tube has

been inserted. The tip of the tube projects approximately 1 cm
above the
carina. Normal course of a nasogastric tube. Moderate
cardiomegaly with
signs of mild overhydration. No evidence of pleural effusions.
Small
retrocardiac atelectasis, no evidence of other lung parenchymal
abnormalities.
No evidence of complications.

[**2176-11-11**] echo
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2).
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal
free wall function. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No
aortic stenosis or regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function.
Right ventricular cavity enlargement with low normal free wall
motion. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior report (images unavailable for review)
of [**2173-1-27**], mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and
right ventricular cavity enlargement are now apparent. The other
findings are similar.

CTA
1. No evidence for pulmonary embolus on this is slightly
suboptimal study.
2. Left thyroid nodule. After outpatient thyroid function test
consider
thyroid ultrasound.
3. New main pulmonary artery dilatation suggests pulmonary
hypertension.
Prominent chest wall venous collateral veins nd dilated internal
mammary vein raise the possibility of systemic shunts.
4. New moderate cardiomegaly with right ventricular enlargement
and
hypertrophy.
5. New abdominal ascites
6. Likley tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia. Consider TBM study
after
treatment.
7. New bilateral small pleural effusions with associated
relaxation
atelectasis.
8. Persistent but increased right hilar adenopathy ,nonspecific.


Abdominal X-ray [**2176-11-22**]:
There is a single dilated small bowel loop in the mid abdomen
measuring up to 3 cm in diameter. There are multiple small bowel
air-fluid
levels. There is significant amount of stool in the cecum and
transverse
colon.

Surgical clips are projected over the pelvis.

IMPRESSION:
Findings are consistent with early complete small-bowel
obstruction. There is
no free air.


Brief Hospital Course:
61yoF with a history of type II diabetes, hypertension, morbid
obesity and chronic dyspnea who presents to the emergency room
with a one month history of worsening dyspnea on exertion.

Acute on chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure: Likely
multifactorial from obesity hypoventilation syndrome and
possibly pulmonary hypertension and diastolic heart failure. Pt
was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Did not have any
signs of pulmonary infection and was not treated with ABx. Did
not have any signs of infection through admission and no Cx's
were positive. Had echo showing good EF and some R ventricle
dilatation. Physical exam was most significant for fluid
overload and gross anasarca to lower abdomen.

Received short course of Prednisone for some wheezes heard on
exam, albuterol and ipratropium nebs, and was aggressively
diuresed with Lasix and by call out from MICU was approx. 20L
negative. Pt improved with this diuresis and pt was able to be
successfully weaned from vent, ABG's by time of d/c significant
for chronic hypercarbia with metabolic compensation which pt
tolerated well. Pt transitioned to PO Lasix on day of call out
which will need to b
