Chief Complaint:
Left lower leg swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
hemodialysis
left internal jugular hemodialysis catheter placement and
removal
right upper extremity PICC placement
chemotherapy: 1st cycle fludarabine (50% dose due to renal
function), 2nd cycle CHOP

R Nephrostomy and  L stent removal

History of Present Illness:
43 y.o women with a history of hepatitis C, recent lymph node
biopsy on [**2147-6-9**] at [**Hospital3 **] hospital who presents today
with left lower extremity redness and pain, who was then found
to have severe hyperkalemia and acute renal failure.

The patient recently was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] hospital
from [**2147-6-9**] to [**2147-6-13**] for an elective excisional biopsy of
diffuse lymphadenopathy, most prominent in her left groin.
Based on limited records, her creatinine was 0.9 at that time.
She was then discharged from the hospital to a [**Hospital1 1501**] due to
inability to ambulate, where she has been residing ever since.
Today, at the [**Hospital1 1501**] her labs were checked and she was found to
have a K of 7.8 and a creatinine of 9.9.  The patient herself
reports that she feels that her urine output has been decreasing
lately along with some increased generalized edema.

In the ED, initial VS were:  98.9 92 146/90 18 95% RA.  On labs,
her K was 8.6 and her creatinine was 10.6. She was given 10U of
regular insulin and 1 amp of D50W for her hyperkalemia.  She was
also given a dose of vancomycin for a possible cellulitis.  A
left lower extremity ultrasound was negative for clot.  Other
notable labs include a uric acid level of 10.1 and a phosphate
of 6.7.  Nephrology was consulted and recommended that she be
admitted to the MICU for medical management of her hyperkalemia.
 Her K after the above interventions dropped to 6.3, and given
an EKG that did not show evidence of cardiac toxicity, dialysis
was not initiated.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were 97.4 79 118/82 15 98%
on RA

STUDIES:
[**2147-7-4**] Lower extremity ultrasound:
No DVT of the left lower extremity.

[**2147-7-4**] CXR:
1.  Retrocardiac opacity compatible with pneumonia or
atelectasis
2.  Prominence of the right hilus may be secondary to low lung
volumes or
hilar opacity.  Suggest follow up radiographs, ideally with
better
inspiration.

[**2147-7-5**] CXR:
1.  Left IJ catheter in the mid SVC.
2.  Mild pulmonary edema.

1. Infiltrative soft tissue mass surrounding the retroperitoneal
region, including the aorta, IVC, and presumably the ureters.
This is likely secondary to lymphoma and would be expected to be
the cause of the patient's bilateral renal obstruction. However,
given the cortical thinning on the left, this is likely a
chronic process. 2. Ground-glass opacities seen within the right
upper lobe and right middle lobe suggestive of atypical
infection. The typical consolidations seen with bacterial
pneumonia are not evident on this examination. 3. Bilateral
pleural effusions are moderate in size, slightly greater on the
right and on the left, with associated atelectasis.

[**2147-7-12**] 12:20 PM # [**Numeric Identifier 103897**] INTRO CATH RENAL
1. Successful uncomplicated placement of a left-sided 8 French
x22 cm nephroureteral stent. 2. Successful uncomplicated
placement of an 8 French nephrostomy tube in the right kidney.
3. A future study is recommended in [**3-17**] weeks to try to attempt
reconversion of the right-sided nephrostomy tube to a
nephroureteral stent and to try to further characterize the
filling defect seen in the right renal pelvis, which could be an
air bubble.

IMPRESSION: Complete resolution of left hydronephrosis.
Near-complete resolution of right hydronephrosis with only
minimal residual hydronephrosis noted.

[**2147-7-19**] Cardiovascular ECHO
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is high normal. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION:
Mild aortic regurgitation with normal valve morphology. Normal
biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. If clinically indicated, a
transesophageal echocardiographic examination is recommended to
as
