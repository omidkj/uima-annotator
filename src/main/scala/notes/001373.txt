Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
epistaxis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
nasal packing

History of Present Illness:
69yo with hx of MVR (mechanical), anemia of chronic disease
(transfusion-dependent), COPD/emphysema and IPF with trans trach
on home O2 presented 5 days ago with epistaxis that had been
intermitent over last 3 weeks prior to admission which has been
chronic issue while on coumadin with negative work up.  In ED
was packed by ENT with bilateral packings which required
continuous O2 monitoring and stay in the MICU, she was monitored
and IR guided emolization was considered, but pt declined the
required general anesthesia for an elective procedure with risk
of stroke as well from emolization.  Now bleeding has slowed
down with minimal packing and she feels better, but still with
right sided facial pain/pressure from the packing and possible
nerve injury. Also stay complicated by conjunctivitios stable on
e-mycin eye drops.  No other shortness of breath or pain or
other symptoms except constipation with pain meds.  She is
anxious to be about transfer to floor and increased ambulation
so she can go home.

Brief Hospital Course:
69F with COPD, IPF, HTN, on coumadin for MVR here with epistaxis
s/p packing and control of bleeding.

1)Epistaxis: initially required nasal packing by ENT which
required continuous O2 monitoring, but remained stable and
although embolization was considered, it was not done because
patient did not want elective intubation which would have been
required for the procedre and with the risk of stroke with
embolization this procedure was deferred.  The packing was
eventually removed and an absorbable intranasal packing was
placed and nares kept moist with ocean spray and vaseline.  She
did have occasional episodes of minimal epistaxis which was
managed with courses of afrin and supportive measures and her
hematocrit remained stable after 3 total units of blood
transfusions.  She was continued on ancef while packing remained
in place.  She did have some pressure headaches from the packing
which was stable on percocet and dilaudid as needed.

2)s/p MVR: for severe mitral regurgitation 6 yrs ago-- stable
for now-- initially coumadin held and reversed with vitamin K
and 2units of FFP and eventually she was restarted on coumadin
with goal INR around 2.5-3.0 as her risk of bleeding is
significant.  During her stay she was bridged with heparin until
INR was therapeutic.

3)Anemia: acute on chronic with blood loss anemia on top of
anemia of chronic disease with baseline hematocrit around 30.
She was transfused total of 3units of PRBC and her hematcrit
remained stable above 30 during the rest of her stay, she was
also restarted on her home epogen regemin.

4)COPD/IPF:  stable at baseline home O2 via trans-tracheal
catheter.  Drainage from trans-tracheal catheter was managed by
interventional pulmonary team with periodic strippings and
bronchoscopies as above.  Otherwise she was continued on her
home doses of albuterol, combivent and inhaled steroids.

5)CHF: 40% EF, but stable and euvolemic-- continued on home
bumex and [**Last Name (un) **]
