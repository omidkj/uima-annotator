Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken to the OR on [**5-13**] by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] for
orthotopic liver transplant, piggyback technique,with portal
vein to portal vein anastomosis, donor celiac artery to
recipient hepatic artery, anastomosis with donor replaced left
hepatic artery and bile duct to bile duct anastomosis. Assisting
surgeon was Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. Please see operative report for
further details.
Estimated blood loss was about [**2103**] cc.  250 cc were given as
cell [**Doctor Last Name 10105**].  The patient received 8000 units of crystalloid,
6units of FFP, 11 units of packed RBCs, no platelets.  Two [**Doctor Last Name 406**]
drains were place with one below the right lobe of the liver and
the other behind the hilum of the liver. He received induction
immunosuppression consisting of solumedrol and cellcept. Postop,
he was transferred in stable condition to the SICU where he
remained intubated. LFTs increased from preop ast 12, alt 6, apk
phos 97 and t.bili 0.4 to postop ast 3274, alt [**2098**], alk  phos
109, and t.bili 10.1.

On [**5-14**] a liver duplex demonstrated the following: 1)
Non-visualized right hepatic artery, normal arterial waveform
identified within the left hepatic artery.
2) Fatty liver.
3) Blunted hepatic vein waveforms suggesting "stiff" liver or an
element of narrowing at the IVC anastomosis.
4) Small amount of ascites. He was taken back to the OR on [**5-14**]
by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] for compartment syndrome and exploratory
laparotomy, liver biopsy and closure
of fascia with mesh under general anesthesia. There was good
flow in the hepatic artery, portal vein and hepatic veins. He
was readmitted to the SICU postop where he was weaned off
propofol and extubated on [**5-15**]. LFTs trended down to ast 26, alt
87, alk phos 182 and t.bili 1.2. Prograf was initiated on postop
days 2 and 1. Prograf was adjusted to 2mg [**Hospital1 **] per levels 7.7.
Subsequent levels were 9.9 and 11 by pod 7. Solumedrol was
tapered to prednisone 20mg qd. He will continue slow taper per
transplant clinic over the next 3 months. Cellcept 1gram po bid
continued. Creatinine increased to 1.9 on pod 5 and 4 then
decreased to 1.3 by pod [**6-30**].
Diet was gradually advanced. Nutrition followed making
recommendations for his diet given recent esophageal dilatation.
This included a speech and swallow eval. Findings included no
evidence of aspiration with suggestion to continue on the
current PO diet of thin liquids and regular consistency solids.
He experienced some nausea and vomiting on post op day [**5-29**] after
taking am meds. A kub was done for mild abd distension and
hypoactive bowel sounds. This revealed relatively markedly
distended segment of small bowel over the mid abdomen with air
seen in the distal colon and rectum of uncertain significance.
He was given a dulcolax suppository with passage of bm. N/V
resolved. PO intake was only fair and calorie counts were ~1500
kcal.

On [**5-21**] his wbc increased to 22. A urine culture was negative.
An abdominal CT was done to rule out intra-abd abscess. This
revealed moderate abdominal/pelvic fluid, moderate bilateral
pleural effusions with associated atelectasis and  right adrenal
hematoma. A cxr showed bibasilar atelectasis left greater than
right. He also had some URI symptoms that improved. Levaquin was
started on [**5-25**] for a ten day course. On [**5-29**] he complained of a
sore mouth. Several 4mm punctate ulcerations (aphthous
appearing) were noted on his tongue and gum. This was cultured
for bacterial and viral organisms. Maaolox/benadryl/lidocaine
swish was ordered.

PT followed and recommended rehab.
He experienced serosanguinous leaking via the right side of his
incision. Several staples were removed and a gauze dressing was
loosely packed into the wound. The medial JP was removed on pod
[**5-29**] and the lateral JP remained in place given outputs of 200cc.
His hct trended down slightly each day to 24 on [**5-29**]. He was
ordered for 2 units of prbc. He continued on lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **] for
edema.
Condition is stable. He is alert and oriented.

He remained in the hospital pending a bed at [**Hospital **] rehab with
labs every Monday and Thursday for cbc, chem 10, lfts, and
trough prograf levels with results fax'd to the [**Hospital1 18**] Transplant
office attn: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1022**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] RN ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 697**]). He is scheduled to
f/u in the clinic.

Patient was discharged home on [**2110-5-30**] after being deemed
capable by team.
