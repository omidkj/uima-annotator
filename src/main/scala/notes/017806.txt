Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
CHF exacerbation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
84M with CAD s/p CABG/PCI (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM1-OM2, SVG to
RCA), systolic and diastolic CHF s/p BiV-IVD (EF=40% in [**6-/2177**]),
ischemic CMP, VT s/p ablation, PAF who presents directly from
clinic for CHF exacerbation.  Patient was recently admitted to
the CCU in [**6-/2177**] where he underwent successful VT ablation and
was also diuresed approximately 3 liters.  His discharge weight
at that admission was 68.5 kg and dry weight according to prior
records is also approximately 68.5-69kg.

On [**2177-8-15**], he was referred for DCCV and had a TEE which was
negative for atrial thrombus.  DCCV was unsuccessful at
restoring sinus rhythm after 300J and 360J external shocks as
well as 35J internal shock with brief return to NSR, but he
subsequently reverted back to Afib.

He reports that over the past 1-2 weeks, he has been feeling
more SOB and more tired.  He has DOE after ambulating only a few
feet and reports that he has felt this way in the past when he
has had HF exacerbations.  He denies any chest pain or
diaphoresis during this time.  He states that he has been
compliant with all of his medications and denies any dietary
indescretions.  No fevers or chills.  His weight has increased a
few pounds from 152lbs at baseline to 155-156 over the past few
days.  He has also been feeling dizzy for the past couple of
weeks and had a fall 3 days prior to admission.  He struck his
right arm on the ground, denies head strike.

On arrival to the floor, patient reports ongoing fatigue and
some mild SOB at rest but denies any other complaints at this
time.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Imaging:
[**2177-8-25**] CXR
FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant change in extent of the pre-existing right pleural
effusion.  Unchanged are the areas of basal atelectasis on both
the right side and in the retrocardiac lung areas.  Unchanged
appearance of the cardiac silhouette and the pacemaker devices.
Unchanged alignment of the sternal wires.

[**2177-8-22**] ECHO
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF = 35
%) secondary to severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the inferior and
posterior walls. The right ventricular free wall thickness is
normal. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with
severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is moderate-to-severe
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0 cm2) (possibly with
low-flow/low-gradient physiology). The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2177-8-21**]
IMPRESSION:
1. New right middle lobe collapse.
2.  Stable right pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
84M with CAD s/p CABG/PCI (LIMA to LAD, SVG to OM1-OM2, SVG to
RCA), systolic and diastolic CHF s/p BiV-IVD (EF=40% in [**6-/2177**]),
ischemic CMP, VT s/p ablation, PAF on warfarin who presents with
fatigue and DOE with evidence of volume overload and acute on
chronic systolic/diastolic heart failure.

Acute Issues:
# Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure
(EF=40%): Pt presented with dypsnea, especially with movement
was a major complaint. Etiology for CHF exacerbation was
unclear; no evidence of ischemia, non-compliance, dietary
indiscretions or infection.  [**Month (only) 116**] be due to the fact that he was
in atrial fibrillation with loss of atrial kick.  Recent
cardioversion was unsuccessful.  On admission appeared mildly
volume overloaded with peripheral edema > pulmonary edema on
exam. Cardiac enzymes were trended with CK and CKMB flat and
minimal elevation of troponin to 0.08 in setting of acute on
chronic kidney disease. CXR showed new right middle lobe
collapse and stable pleural effusions without frank pulmonary
edema. The patient was 4 lbs above his dry weight. An 80 mg IV
lasix bolous was given and then patient started on 10mg/hr gtt.
Metolazone was also utilized to augment diuresis, and carvedilol
was continued. Patient was not on ACEi/[**Last Name (un) **] [**12-26**] poor renal
function. The patient was placed on 2g sodium diet, 1.5 L fluid
restriction, daily weights, and strict I/Os. Pt did well with
aggressive diuresis wh
