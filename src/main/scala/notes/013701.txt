Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is an 89 yo M with history of CAD s/p CABG, CHF secondary
to ischemic CMY with EF 25%, Afib, IDDM who presents from his NH
today with acute onset shortness of breath.
In the ED, he was initially thought to be in acute heart
failure, given that he was hypertensive to the 170's, so he was
given lasix 40mg IV x1, placed on a nitro gtt and bipap. CXR
revealed a large RLL consolidation, so the patient was also
covered for HAP with vanco and zosyn, but only vanco given. Sats
were only 90% on BiPAP at 10/5, FiO2 0.50. Labs were significant
for a large bandemia, lactate of 5.1, troponin 0.19 and mild
renal failure. 10 units of regular insulin was given for a
fingerstick of 450. Because the patient is DNR/DNI (which was
reconfirmed by the ED with the patient's HCP), he was not
intubated and transferred to the MICU for further management.

Physical Exam:

Pertinent Results:
[**2103-7-17**]: Cxray: Of note, the patient was unable to lie still and
the image is limited by respiratory motion. However, there has
been interval development of a focal patchy airspace opacity
involving the right lower lung zone. There is a persistent large
left-sided pleural effusion.  The pulmonary vasculature within
the upper lobes appears within normal limits.
The patient is status post median sternotomy with a single lead
left-sided cardiac pacer in place. Patient is status post aortic
valve replacement. IMPRESSION: Interval development of patchy,
focal airspace opacity involving the right lower lung zone. This
may represent a pneumonia or possibly asymmetric pulmonary
edema. Followup films after diuresis may be of benefit.
Persistent moderate-to-large sized left-sided pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7435**] is an 89 yo M with history of CAD, ischemic CMY with
CHF, IDDM here with severe sepsis from likely RLL pna.

1)Respiratory Distress/severe sepsis: Likely dyspneic acutely
from RLL pneumonia, seems to be very dry on exam with elevated
blood sugars. Differential also includes PE and asymmetric
pulmonary edema, but exam is not consistent with these
etiologies. Difficult to volume resuscitate aggressively given
EF 25%. After discussion with family patient's code status was
changed to CMO. Patient expired on [**7-18**] with family at the
bedside.
