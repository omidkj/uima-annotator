Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2969**]
Chief Complaint:
Carcinoma of the left lung -> upper lobe

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- thoracotomy for left upper lobectomy
- rexploration for bleeding
- re-intubation for respiratory decompensation and Pneumonia


History of Present Illness:
The patient a 65-year-old woman with a 40 pack-year smoking
history who quit a number of years ago and was found to have an
intensely PET-positive solitary left upper lobe pulmonary
nodule. Bronchoscopic approach to biopsy was nondiagnostic but
there was no evidence for any disseminated disease. I felt this
was highly likely to represent lung cancer. There was 1 enlarged
enhancing AP window lymph node that was not PET positive. I
recommended that we stage the
mediastinum and if it is node-negative proceed onto definitive
resection as it was presumably early stage lung cancer. She
agreed to proceed.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2167-5-12**] 10:14 AM
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**5-11**]:

Postoperative left lower lobe atelectasis and left pleural
thickening extending over the apex of the aortic arch is
unchanged. Also stable following removal of left basal pleural
tube is a small locule of air along the left lower costal
pleural surface and a second small air collection at the left
apex medially, now containing a very small volume of pleural
fluid. Heart size is normal and mediastinal position unchanged.
Right lung grossly clear.

Pathology Examination
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: LEVEL 5 LYMPH NODE, LEFT UPPER LOBECTOMY,
LEVEL 10 LYMPH NODES, LEVEL 11 LYMPH NODES, L9 LYMPH NODES (5).

DIAGNOSIS:

II.  Left upper lobectomy (B-J):
Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; see synoptic
report.

Lung Cancer Synopsis

MACROSCOPIC
Specimen Type:  Lobectomy.
Laterality:  Left.
Tumor Site:  Upper lobe.
Tumor Size
    Greatest dimension:  1.7 cm.  Additional dimensions:  1.5
cm.

MICROSCOPIC
Histologic Type:  Squamous cell carcinoma with focal clear cell
change.
Histologic Grade:  G3:  Poorly differentiated.

EXTENT OF INVASION
Primary Tumor:  pT1:  Tumor 3 cm or less in greatest dimension,
surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic
evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus (ie,
not in the main bronchus).

Regional Lymph Nodes:  pN0:  No regional lymph node metastasis.
Distant metastasis:  pMX:  Cannot be assessed.
Margins:
    Margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma:
        Distance from closest margin:  0.5 cm.  Specified
margin:  Bronchial resection margin.
Direct extension of tumor:  None.
Venous invasion (V):  Absent.
Lymphatic Invasion (L):  Absent.

Additional Pathologic Findings:  Inflammation, Chronic, mild.
Emphysematous change and chronic hemorrhage.

Comments:  Immunostains of the tumor are strongly positive for
cytokeratin 7 and TTF-1, and negative for cytokeratin 20,
supporting a pulmonary origin. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. [**Doctor Last Name **] reviewed slides C,
D and G-I and concurs.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery Service after
undergoing a bronchoscopy, thoracotomy, and left upper
lobectomy.  An epidural was in place for pain control. The
patient initially tolerated this procedure well and was being
recovered in the PACU without event.  However, late evening on
POD 0 the pt. became hypotensive, 6 point hct drop. Pt was given
two fluid boluses - one of normal saline and one of hespan.  She
was responsive to the fluid though her systolic blood pressures
were maintained in the 90s for the duration of the night. Her
chest tube output was minimal but more sanguinous than
serosanguinous.  A CXR late that evening revealed a large left
opacity possibly consistent w/ a hemothorax. On the morning of
POD 1 pt was taken back to the OR for re-exploration for
bleeding. A large amount of clot was removed and small areas of
generalized oozing were cauterized but no definitive source of
bleeding was isolated. Two chest tubes and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] were placed
at the time of surgery for drainage and maintained to sxn. Pt
was extubated and transferred to the PACU-once recovered pt was
tarnsferred to the floor for ongoing post-op care.
She was maintained on peri op ancef. Chest tubes were placed to
water seal on POD#[**2-27**]. epidural was changed to starigt
bupivicaine and morphine PCA was added to improve pain control
w/ good effect. Pt was able to cough and deep breathe
effectively, chest tube output was minimal and serosang, urine
output was adeq.
CXR revealed a large gastric bubble and dilated loops of bowel
-pt did c/o fullness, was belching, passing flatus and [**Last Name (un) 1815**]
clears.
Later that afternoon of POD#[**2-27**] pt began to desaturate to 90% on
35% face mask. A CXR did reveal mild volume overload and a right
mid-lung infiltrate consistent w/ possible aspiration PNA. Pt
was given lasix w/ rapid and brisk response and IV levaquin. A
CT angio was ordered to r/o PE however, pt resp compromise
worsened and requiring CTA to be post-poned and pt to the
transferred to the SICU. She was intubated for progressive resp
decompensation. Bronch after intub revealed copious secretions
and multiple mucous plugs. Flagyl was added to regimen for ?
aspir PNA. Once resp stabilized on the vent , she proceeded to
CTA which was neg for PE. She remained intub overnoc rec'd
ongoing pul toilet and diuresis. She was extubated the following
day POD#[**3-31**]. Transferred out of the ICU and progressed well w/
post op course. On POD# [**5-1**] chest tubes placed to WS-cxr w/no
PTX, ant CT removed, post-pull CXR: no PTX.  POD# [**6-2**] posterior
