MRI head: There is no slow diffusion to indicate an acute
infarct. There is no midline shift, mass effect, or
hydrocephalus. There is opacification of both sphenoid sinuses
which would be consistent with sphenoid sinusitis or recent
intubation. The ethmoid sinus air cells also contain areas of
mucosal thickening. The normal vascular flow voids are present.
There are no areas of abnormal magnetic susceptibility. There
are no enhancing abnormalities.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of an acute infarct or enhancing
abnormalities

Brief Hospital Course:
On arrival to emergency room pt was already intubated, began
thrashing and pulling for ET tube.  He was given multiple doses
of benzodiazepine for sedation and calmed.  He was transferred
to the MICU and on arrival there was found to be in PEA arrest.
Following are the problems as they occured during the
hospitalization, firt in the MICU and later on the general
medical floor.
.
s/p PEA arrest: Pt was successively rescusitated by the MICU
team but was hypotensive for 15 - 20 minutes.  Cause thought to
be possible hypoxia.
.
Shock:  In MICU pt treated for sepsis thought secondary to
pneumonia.  Required pressors.  Complicated by ARDS as well as
CHF with evidence of prior infarct on EKG and echo showing
moderate global hypokinesis, 30% LVEF.
.
CHF: Required Nitroglycerin drip in setting of hypertension and
cardiac hypokinesis s/p resuscitation from shock.
.
Aspiration pneumonia: Pt completed a 14 day course of Zosyn
Now actually hypertensive requiring nitro drip.
.
ETOH intoxication: On admission etoh level of 500. During early
course maintained on benzodiazepines.  Treated with thiamine,
folic acid, and multivitamin throughout hospitalization.
.
Acidosis: Mixed acute respiratory acidosis and metabolic
acidosis (AG and non-AG) in setting of lactic acidosis.  Now
improved.
-monitor ABG and lytes
.
Coag negative staph bacteremia - In blood culture several days
after admit, though initial cultures negative. Positive culture
showed two different morphologies.  Central line tip without
bacterial growth.  Treated with 2 weeks of Vancomycin, TTE
without vegetations.
.
MEDICAL FLOOR COURSE:
Cognitive impairment: Thought secondary to anoxic brain injury.
For this reason in addition to his chronic psychotic illness,
pyschiatry team felt pt was unable to care for himself on the
streets any longer (pt is homeless and at times lives at
[**Hospital1 **] House)
-gaurdianship was sought and obtained.
-long-term placement sought.

.
Question of paranoid schizophrenia history: Pt agitated at times
on [**Hospital1 **], managed with seroquel.
-improved and remained calm and cooperative on floor, was not
requiring prn haldol for agitation.

[**Known firstname **] continued to improve on the medical floor, and
persistently asked to be release back to his "city life."
Re-evaluation of decision-making by all parties involved
(psychiatry, social work, hospitalist attending, and guardian)
was discussed [**2118-8-12**].  Psychiatry and the legal guardian, [**Name (NI) 553**]
[**Name (NI) 656**], actually think he does not require guardianship at this
time.  However, disposition became protracted because it was
felt that the patient needed possible permanent conservatorship.

Temporary guardianship lapse [**2118-9-15**] and Legal/Risk management
and Ethics consultation felt that the patient was capable of
making his own decisions and he was discharged to a group living
facility, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2048**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] house. His care was also accepted by
DMH and they will arrange outpatient follow up.
