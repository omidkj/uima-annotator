Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Change in mental status, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 97172**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of CAD s/p MI,
CHF (EF 50%), aortic stenosis (area 0.8cm2), dementia, MDS who
was admitted on the afternoon of [**3-6**] from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with
change in mental status.  In the ED, vitals were Tmax 102, BP
110/67, HR 124, 95% on 4L NC.  Cardiac enzymes were sent from
the ED and she ruled in for NSTEMI (troponin 0.47, CK 81).  BNP
on admission was [**Numeric Identifier 97173**], lactate 2.4.  EKG on admission with
sinus tachycardia, RBBB, no ST or TW changes.  She was not
started on heparin at that time but was given ASA 325mg in the
ED.  There was question of a pneumonia on CXR and Vanc/Levo were
started empirically.
.
Overnight on [**3-7**], nursing became concerned due to increased
ectopy on telemetry.  Check of vital signs at the time revealed
hypoxia to 88% on 6L NC.  She was placed on a NRB improvement to
98% O2 sat.  She denied any chest pain, shortness of breath,
palpitations, lightheadedness, or dizziness.  Her only complaint
was back pain which had been present since admission.  CE
trending up from those in ED (CK 158, trop 1.14).  CXR showed
worsening pulmonary edema bilaterally with bilateral pleural
effusions.  Repeat EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, rate of 94,
STE in V1-V3 and TWI in V4-V6, I, II, aVF, aVL.  She was given
Lasix 40mg x1, morphine 1mg, and 1 inch nitropaste was applied.
Plan to transfer to CCU for closer monitoring and noninvasive
ventilation.
.
On arrival to the CCU she is asking for water.  She notes right
sided back pain which is stable from prior.  She denies chest
pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, nausea or diaphoresis.
Noninvasive ventilation was tried on arrival to ICU but patient
would not tolerate the mask.
.
Of note, her home dose of lasix had been held for one week due
to a recent gastroenteritis and dehydration.  She was treated
with IVF.  Her metoprolol had also been decreased from
Metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] to toprol 12.5mg daily.
.
Review of symptoms is limited by patient's dementia.  She denies
any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CXR:
 This is a study limited by patient motion and nonvisualization
of the left costophrenic junction. There is prominence of the
pulmonary hila with central congestion, more apparent on the
left. There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION:
1. Central pulmonary vascular congestion.

TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and
inferolateral akinesis along with anterior and anterolateral
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35%). The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (area 0.7 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
severe aortic stenosis. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of CAD s/p MI, CHF w/ EF 45-50%,
[**Hospital 90129**] transferred to CCU with respiratory distress, elevated
troponins and ?STEMI vs. LV strain pattern with plan for medical
management as patient is too high risk for catheterization.
.
1) Respiratory Distress: New oxygen requirement on presentation
and increasing pulmonary edema on CXR.  EKG showed ST elevations
in anterior leads.  These changes may be related to LV strain
given likely LVH vs ischemic.  ABG done on NRB showed pH
7.4/27/83.  Patient was tachypneic on exam, question if there is
some component of anxiety contributing to tachypnea.  Given EKG
changes, CXR and elevated BNP on admission, patient is likely in
decompensated heart failure due to infection +/- recent d/c of
lasix and metoprolol.  Now appears to be dry by labs and exam so
respiratory distress was likely a flash pulmonary edema but not
total body volume up. O2 requirement falling but still present.
Pulmonary edema resolved on CXR
- Surface echocardiogram->EF 30-35% with inferior and
anterolateral hypo/akinesis.
- Temporarily on heparin drip for ischemia, now off.
- On plavix, aspirin
- Lasix resumed at discharge.
- Initial "pneumonia" seen on CXR may have been pulmonary ede
