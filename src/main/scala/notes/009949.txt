History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 77625**] is a 73yo F with h/o CRI presenting with narrow
complex tachycardia and anemia. Has not seen a doctor in 30
years and according to patient and family have been worried
about weight loss and laxative abuse at home. Has been using mag
citrate excessively at home. Came into PCP today because
daughter was concerned that patient was feeling so weak at home.
 Also, after discussion with her friend she was complaining of
increased diarrhea at home.

At PCP's office EKG was HR in 180s so transferred here.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.9 HR170 BP115/78 RR20 O2Sat100.
Looked like SVT on EKG in ED and broke off and on in ED on tele.
After she broke is in sinus without ST changes. CXR normal. 2
PIVs. Mentating appropriately the whole time. Trop slightly
elevated in setting of CRI.  Also, got 1L NS, 40PO KCL, 40 IV
KCL, 2gm calcium gluconate, and 2 gms mag sulfate. Consented for
2 units pRBCs. HR now slower on 10 IV dilt and 30 po dilt. Never
got adenosine. Currently controlled in 90s. Guaiac negative but
no stool in vault in ED. No abdominal tenderness.  Prior to
transfer vitals were: HR:86 T:97.6 BP:101/56 O2Sat:97%RA.

On the floor, her initial VS were: T: 97.1, HR: 98, BP: 107/67,
RR: 18, 100% on RA.  She had no complaints except feeling more
fatigued recently. She had some bursts of SVT into the 160s but
would come down to NSR without intervention. One unit of pRBCs
was hung upon arrival to the ICU. She also received 1gm calcium
chloride upon arrival.

STUDIES:
[**5-22**] EKG:
Long R-P interval supraventricular tachycardia. Non-specific
ST-T wave
changes.

[**5-22**] CXR:
Left lower lung linear atelectasis versus scarring. Otherwise
unremarkable.

[**5-23**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30 %) with anterior, septal and apical
akinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe
(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

[**5-27**] CXR:
In comparison with the prior studies, there is continued
enlargement
of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary edema. Some mild
atelectatic changes are seen at the bases. However, no evidence
of acute focal pneumonia.

[**5-27**] CT head:
1. No acute intracranial abnormality; specifically, there is no
evidence of hemorrhage or edema.
2. Clear included paranasal sinuses, middle ear cavities and
mastoid air
cells.
3. Well-defined lesion in the right frontovertex scalp soft
tissues; this
should be correlated directly with physical examination.

[**5-29**] EGD:
- Erythema and congestion in the gastroesophageal junction
compatible with esophagitis
- Mild erythema, mild atrophy in the stomach body compatible
with gastritis (biopsy)
- Small hiatal hernia
- Mild congestion and erythema in the antrum compatible with
gastritis (biopsy)
- Ulcer in the incisura (endoclip)
- The antrum was deformed, suggesting previous PUD. The tissue
around pyloric channel was edematous
- Granularity, erythema and congestion in the duodenal bulb and
first part of the duodenum compatible with duodenitis (biopsy)
- The duodenal bulb was deformed, suggesting previous PUD.
- Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum
Recommendations:
- follow-up biopsy results
- Pt needs repeat EGD to have biopsy from the ulcer to r/o
gastric CA while she is more stable
