Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
fever
endocarditis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Redo sternotomy, mitral valve replacement [**2103-4-13**]


History of Present Illness:
27M with a history of IVDA and endocarditis in [**2098**] and [**2100**].
He
is s/p mechanical AVR and MVR in [**2100**].  He presented to [**Hospital6 **] on [**2103-4-6**] with fever, malaise, weakness, vomiting
and diarrhea.  He developed diplopia and strabismus in the ED.
He does have a history of intracranial hemorrhage, however CT
was
negative for acute pathology at this time.  He is
anti-coagulated
for his mechanical valves, and INR became supra-therapeutic at
8.
He was treated with FFP and Vitamin K.  ID was consulted and he
was empirically given Vancomycin, Gentamicin and Zosyn.  Per
report his blood cultures have grown methicillin sensitive staph
aureus.  Gentamicin has since been discontinued due to elevated
level of 4.7.  Trans-thoracic Echo revealed a peri-valvular leak
of the prosthetic mitral.  Prosthetic Aortic Valve is well
seated
without AI.
The patient was transferred to the ICU and subsequently became
increasingly tachypneic, tachycardic and agitated.  He was
intubated and transiently required levophed for hypotension but
was able to be weaned off with fluid recussitation but has been
progressively more oliguric with rising creatinine.  Initial
blood cultures grew methicillin sensitive Staph Aureus and his
antibiotics were changed to nafcillin/rifampin/gentamycin.  Of
note, creatinine rose from 0.6 to 1.3 to 2.9 on [**4-10**].  He is
turned down for Redo Sternotomy, AVR/MVR at [**Hospital1 **] due to his
continued IV drug abuse and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.  At the time of transfer he is hemodynamically
stable, without pressor support.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac Echocardiogram:
TTE [**2103-4-8**]
EF 50%
Mechanical Mitral Valve- perivalvular leak
PASP 50-55mmHg
Mechanical Aortic Valve- mean gradient 32mmHg, no AI

TEE [**4-10**]
LVEF 65%, hyperdynamic LV
aortic valve with vegetations on both the LVOT and the aortic
side.  The area posterior to the aortic root appears to be
edematous and with lucent areas whic is suspicious for absess
formation, no obvious fistula.  AV mean gradiant 70mmHg.  The
mechanical mitral valve has moderate paravalvular regurgitation
in the lateral and anterolateral annulus with dehiscense.
Therre
are multiple vegetations on the valve towards the atrial side.
The gradients across the mitral valve are significantly
elevated.
MV mean gradient 12mmHg.


Brief Hospital Course:
After transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] the patient remained sedated and
intubated.  He was tachypneic and failed SBT.  He underwent MRI
brain which showed several new infarcts (likely septic) and
neurology was consulted.  He was also in renal failure on
admission with rising creatinine, acidosis and hyperkalemia.
Renal was consulted and he was started on CVVH.  Given his
history of ICH with previous episodes of
endocarditis, he underwent MRI-brain which showed several new
infarcts (likely from septic emboli). He was seen by ID and they
are recommending continuing the same antibiotics.  It was agreed
that he would need surgical intervention, but given the risk of
the procedure extensive discussions were had between the
surgical team, CVICU team and the family.    An ethics consult
was also obtained.  A family meeting was held with the pt.'s
brother and [**Name2 (NI) **] and they would like him to have surgery and
understand the extreme high risk of the procedure.

On [**2103-4-14**] the he was taken to the OR.  The family understood
the high risk of surgery.

Unfortunately in the OR he remained profoundly acidotic.  During
the case Acute Care Surgery was consulted intra-operatively to
explore the abdomen for possible ischemic GI contents given the
persistent acidosis and elevated lactate.  There was no obvious
source for this and the abdomen was closed.  Another discussion
was had with the family and the attending cardiac surgeon and it
was decided that he would be taken off cardiopulmonary bypass
despite his acidosis.  He had no heart function after being
taken off bypass and expired thereafter.  Time of death 1719.
