History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 78131**] is a 78M with stageIV NSCLC on palliative Tarceva
who presents from his nursing facility with fevers x2d as high
as 103.6F. Per paperwork from rehab, he was given levofloxacin
500mg.
.
Of note, he was recently admitted to the OMED service, having
presented with fevers and discharged on [**7-14**] on cefpodoxime and
azithromycin for suspected pneumonia.
.
In the ED, initial vs were T98 P 73 BP 86/51 RR 22 98% on . He
was given vancomycin, cefepime, flagyl, acetaminophen, zofran,
and started on peripheral dopamine. Awake and mentating, making
small amounts of dark urine. CT abdomen done for h/o 1day of
diarrhea, noncontrast showed ?of colitis. Got 5L of saline. BP
remains 70's systolic on 15mcg dopamine and levophed.
.
On the floor, he denies any complaints - though initially
reported some abdominal pain to the RN. Review of systems
otherwise negative, though unclear if patient's history is
reliable.

[**7-29**] FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA

[**7-28**] EKG: Probable sinus rhythm with low amplitude P waves
(visible in lead V1) versus ectopic atrial rhythm. Right
bundle-branch block. Left anterior fascicular block. Q-T
interval prolongation. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2118-7-7**] P waves are less apparent. Q-T interval is more
prolonged.

[**7-28**] CXR: 1. Stable post-surgical changes in the right lung from
prior right lower lobectomy and upper [**Month/Year (2) 3630**] wedge resection due
to known non-small cell lung cancer.
2. Hazy opacity in the left lower [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] reflect atelectasis.


[**7-28**] CT Abd/pelvis:
1. Bibasilar lung consolidations, worse when compared to prior
exam.
Differential diagnosis includes infectious etiologies as well as
a slow
growing lesion such as bronchoalveolar carcinoma. Clinical
correlation is
recommended.
2. No evidence of small bowel obstruction. Colon appears
relatively
featureless with air-fluid levels and possibly pericolonic fat
stranding
versus third spacing. These findings may suggest a colitis.
3. Extensive vascular calcifications.
4. Large prostate.
5. S1 vertebral body fracture with buckling of the superior
cortex, worse
when compared to prior exam.

[**7-30**] Left LENI:
IMPRESSION: No left lower extremity DVT.

[**7-31**] KUB:
FINDINGS:
Small bowel loops containing air are seen without distension.
There is a
paucity of air in the left lower quadrant which might be due to
liquid stool within the descending colon. No free air is seen on
the right lateral decubitus film. The visualized osseous
structures are unremarkable. The right lung base is not well
seen with the dome of the diaghragm being pushed superiorly.
This correlates with the right lower [**Month/Year (2) 3630**] atelactasis on the
corresponding CT.
IMPRESSION: No distended loops of bowel seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 78131**] is a 78M with stage IV NSLC who presents with
fevers from his rehab facility.
.
* Hypotension: Patient presented with hypotension concerning for
sepsis.  He was briefly on levophed and was taken off of
pressors when SBP 100s-110s.  His hypotension was probably due
to hypovolemia from diuresis but severe hypotension in setting
of developing sepsis was also considered.  Lactate down to 1.0
from 1.3 on admission with SVO2 73.
On the floors, his SBP's ranged in the 130's to 140's and he was
restarted on his home doses of LASIX WAS HELD FOR THE SEVERAL
DAYS PRIOR TO DISCHARGE BECAUSE HE WAS AUTODIURESING.  HE NEEDS
TO BE RE-EVALUATED REGULARLY FOR WHETHER LASIX NEEDS TO BE
RESTARTED. HE WILL LIKELY NEED HIS LASIX RESTARTED AT SOME POINT
AT REHAB.  His pressures remained stable throughout
hospitalization.
.
* Fever: Patient's fever likely caused by C diff as patient is
toxin positive, although aspiration pneumonia was also
considered a possibility given evidence of dysphagia on prior
video swallow. His underlying pulmonary malignancy predisposes
him to a post-obstructive pneumonia. However the absence of
cough or hypoxia made a pulmonary etiology less compelling.
Blood and urine cultures are negative.  His C difficile colitis
was originally treated with PO vancomycin and IV flagyl. Prior
to discharge, as diarrhea began to resolve, he was switched to
PO flagyl alone, to be continued for a two week course (until
[**2118-8-12**]).
.
* L leg swelling and pain: Patient had lower extremity pain
edema greater on left than right after receiving fluid
resuscitation in the ICU.  LENI showed no evidence of DVT. He
was diuresed with lasix until his fluid output was negative. He
was autodiuresing on discharge so his lasix was held. His fluid
status should be reassessed daily to determine if he needs to be
restarted on lasix.

* Hyponatremia: Patient's hyponatremia resolved after
intravenous fluids, which supports hypovolemia as cause on
admission.  Review of OMR shows Na's running ~130. At last
discharge, thought to have a component of SIADH.

* Acute renal failure: Patient had creatinine elevated to 1.4
and FeNa was 0.1 on admission.  Creatinine has improved to
0.7-0.8 (his baseline). His acute renal failure has resolved and
was likely pre-renal as it improved with IVF.

* Anemia:  His hematocrit is down from admission but suspect
this was secondary to hemoconcentration.  His anemia is
consistent with baseline.

* NSCLC: Advanced disease, on palliative chemotherapy.  Social
work and palliative care were consulted throughout this
hospitalization and discussed goals of care with the family.
Erlotinib will be restarted on [**2118-8-19**] and should be taked every
other day. He will follow up wit
