History of Present Illness:
73 yo man with COPD on 3L home O2, CAD s/p CABG ~12 yrs ago,
atrial fibrillation on coumadin, HTN, HL, OSA on CPAP who
presented to [**Hospital1 392**]
on [**4-24**] with abdominal pain that started earlier that day. The
pain was not associated with food and not releived by OTC
antiacids. At the OSH he was found to have a fever to 100.5,
elevated LFT's concerning for cholecystitis. RUQ U/S revealed
distended gallbladder with stones but no evidence of
cholecystitis and dilated common bile and intrahepatic ducts.
MRCP revealed 4 large stones (up to 1 cm) in the common bile
duct, no ductal dilation and periportal edema consistent with
ascending cholangitis. He remained hemodynamically stable, he
received one dose of gentamycin and was subsequently started on
Zosyn/Flagyl, given 2 units of FFP and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for
ERCP. Of note, he was found to have a new RBBB at OSH and was
ROMI.
.
On admssion he was found to have WBC 12.1, BUN/Cr 41/2.0, ALT
340, AST 238, AP 253, Tbili 5.5 and amylase 564 and was taken
directly to ERCP. Patient received ampicillin/gentamycin prior
to procedure and was intubated. ERCP revealed two 1 cm stones,
multiple smaller stones, CBD dilation to 12 mm, a stent was
placed and a sphynteromy done. He was succesfully extubated
after the procedure.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], patient denied any pain and stated that he was
feeling well.

Birth Date: [**2065-6-3**] (73 years) Instrument: TJF-160VF ([**Numeric Identifier 52997**])

 [**Numeric Identifier 52998**] Indications: A level 4 consult was performed
Fever, RUQ abdominal pain, jaundice, and an abnormal MRCP with
dilated bile ducts and choledocholithiasis all consistent with
cholangitis

Medications: General Anesthesia
Ampicillin 2 gm IV
Gentamycin 60 mg IV

Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential
complications were explained to the patient, who indicated his
understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. A
physical exam was performed. The patient was administered
General anesthesia. The patient was placed in the supine
position and an endoscope was introduced through the mouth and
advanced under direct visualization until the third part of the
duodenum was reached. Careful visualization was performed. The
procedure was not difficult. The quality of the preparation was
good. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
complications.
Findings: Esophagus: Limited exam of the esophagus was normal
Stomach: Limited exam of the stomach was normal
Duodenum: Limited exam of the duodenum was normal
Major Papilla: A single periampullary diverticulum with a medium
opening was found at the major papilla. There was also a
medium-sized peri-ampullary lipoma.
Cannulation:  On the first attempt, cannulation of the biliary
duct was successful and deep with a sphincterotome after a
guidewire was placed. Contrast medium was injected resulting in
complete opacification. The procedure was not difficult. The
pancreatic duct was not cannulated.

Biliary Tree: Two 10 mm piston-like stones that were causing
partial obstruction were seen at the lower third of the common
bile duct. There was post-obstructive dilation of the mid and
distal CBD to 12 mm with a mild dilation of the upper CBD and
CHD to 8-9 mm. A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock
position using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. Two
large 1 cm stones and a copious amount of small stones, stone
fragments, and thick sludge were extracted successfully using a
9-12mm Rx balloon catheter. A 9cm by 10FR plastic biliary stent
was placed successfully in the CBD using a Microvasive 10FR
stent introducer kit. Multiple stones were seen in the
gallbladder. The cystic duct did opacify with contrast and did
not appear to be obstructed.

Recommendations: Return to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU overnight.
NPO overnight with aggressive IV hydration. He will need several
liters of NS upfront and then a high infusion rate of
250-300cc/hr for cholangitis and gallstone pancreatitis.
Continue IV antibiotics for cholangitis.
Transfuse 2 units of FFP and please give 2.5 mg of vitamin K.
No coumadin, ASA, plavix, or NSAIDs for 5-7 days.
Repeat ERCP with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 10532**] in 4 weeks for
stent removal. He will need to hold coumadin for 5 days prior to
this procedure.
Additional notes: The procedure was performed by the ERCP fellow
and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 52995**].
