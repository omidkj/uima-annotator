[**2125-7-9**] 8:33 PM CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST:
FINDINGS: There are small bibasilar effusions and associated
atelectasis. No focal consolidation. Coronary artery
calcifications are seen within an enlarged heart. There is no
pericardial effusion.
ABDOMEN: Again seen is pneumobilia, with an indwelling biliary
stent in place, unchanged in position. A left hepatic lobe cyst
measuring 3.1 x 3.9 cm is unchanged. There is a small gallstone
within a decompressed gallbladder. There is no biliary
dilatation. The spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are normal
in appearance. The kidneys are somewhat atrophic; however, there
is symmetric excretion of contrast. Multiple cysts, right side
more so than left, some of which are slightly increased in
density and likely reflect hemorrhagic/proteinaceous cysts.
PELVIS: The bowel is decompressed, without dilated loop. There
are air- fluid levels within the colon; however, there is no
bowel wall thickening or surrounding stranding. Numerous
diverticula are seen within the sigmoid colon, without
inflammatory changes. A Foley catheter is present within a
decompressed bladder. Atherosclerotic calcifications are again
seen throughout. Extensive degenerative changes of the
thoracolumbar spine without acute findings.
IMPRESSION:
1. No abscess within the abdomen or pelvis, as clinically
questioned. No bowel wall thickening or abnormality, aside from
colonic fluid and diverticulosis.
2. Small bibasilar pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis.

[**2125-7-17**] [**Month/Day/Year **]:
-A plastic stent previusly placed in the biliary duct was found
in the major papilla and was removed using a snare.
-Cannulation of the biliary duct was performed with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
-Cholangiogram showed a CBD diamter of 11 mm with 2 mobile
filling defects consistent with stones.
-A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using
a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
-2 stones were extracted successfully using a 11 mm balloon. The
duct was cleared with an occlusion cholangiogram.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to TSICU.  WBC was 14.  He was started on
vancomycin for his h/o MRSA PNA.  CT abdomen/pelvis failed to
demonstrate abscess or bowel wall thickening/abnormalities.  His
biliary system was unchanged in appearance.  Blood cultures were
drawn and were negative.  Urine culture grew yeast.  He was
hydrated and his WBC decreased to WNL.  Vancomycin was d/c'd on
HD 3.  PEG was placed at bedside on HD 3.  Tube feeds were
started on HD 4.  On HD 5, he was decannulated.  Rheumatology
was consulted for gout management and recommended Solumedrol
followed by a prednisone taper, colchicine, allopurinol, and
outpatient followup.  His WBC increased; he was started on
fluconazole for the yeast in his urine on HD 6.  It was stable x
3 days at ~17 on discharge.  On HD 7, he was transferred to the
floor.  On HD 8, Speech & Swallow cleared him for pureed solids
and nectar thickened liquids.  On HD 9, he underwent [**Month/Day/Year **] for
stent removal with extraction of 2 gallstones and
sphincterotomy.  The following morning, he was restarted on
clears and tube feeds and advanced as tolerated.  His LFTs were
WNL.  He was afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating tube
feeds and diet, and his pain was well controlled on PO
medication.  He is being discharged to [**Hospital1 **] and will follow
up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (Rheumatology) and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
