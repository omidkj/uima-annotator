49 yo F with h/o DM, CHF, sleep apnea, morbid obesity,

confusion.  She noted decreased urine output over the previous 4
days as well as fatigue.  Per report, pt had recently started
Klonopin and had decreased PO intake with some nausea and
vomiting.  She denied fevers, chills, or pain.  At [**Hospital1 **],
patient was found to be in ARF with elevated Cr to 8.0 (from
0.9) and K of 6.8 but no EKG changes. Patient was subsequently
transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] ED where she was given 1 amp of bicarbonate,
70mg of Kayexalate, NS x 1 L, CaCl, insulin 10 units with
dextrose. She also had a RIJ placed. Patient was also found to
have pH of 7.16, pCO2 59 (baseline 50s). HCO3 20.  She was
poorly responsive and incoherent.  BIPAP was initiated in the
ED.  Initial ABG showed improvement in pH.
.
ICU course:  On repeat ABG, pH was again 7.16 and pt continued
to be poorly responsive.  She was intubated for airway
protection and acidosis management.  She was put on IV fluids
with HCO3 for her ARF and acidosis.  Her hyperkalemia was
managed with Calcium, Insulin and Dextrose, and Kayexelate, and
her potassium normalized.  At the time of transfer to the floor,
the patient had been extubated.  Her mental status had improved,
and she was alert and oriented x 3.  Her Cr had decreased to 1.4

Brief Hospital Course:
49 y.o. F with morbid obesity, OSA, DM2 who presented with
mental status changes from ARF with hyperkalemia and acidosis.
.
# ARF - Etiology likely prerenal from dehydration, although
NSAID use may suggest intrinsic component.  Cr resolved to 0.8
at time of discharge.  Patient was educated re: need to watch
hydration when taking lasix and she was discharged on a low dose
(lasix 40mg po bid) to prevent recurrence of prerenal failure.
In addition, her aldactone and ibuprofen were stopped to prevent
any damage to kidneys until she could be assessed as an
outpatient.
.
# Respiratory distress-- patient was intubated for acidosis that
did not respond to IV bicarb as well as airway protection given
her poor mental status.  She was extubated 1 day later.  During
her hospitalization, she returned to her baseline oxygen
requirement of 2L nasal cannula at night and intermittently
during the day.
.
# Hyperkalemia--patient was admitted with potassium 6.8.  She
did not have EKG changes.  She was given Calcium, Insulin and
Dextrose, and Kayexalate.  As her kidneys recovered, her
potassium normalized.
.
# Acidosis--was felt to be both metabolic from her renal failure
and respiratory from her baseline hypoventilation/CO2 retention.
- resolved with intubation and recovery of renal function
.
# Chest pain--patient had an episode of chest pressure which she
says was brought on by anxiety.
- Cardiac enzymes negative x 2, no EKG ST segment changes
- pt was given oxygen, morphine, and aspirin while being ruled
out for MI
- pt has no h/o MI, states that she often experiences chest
pressure during episodes of stress
.
# Anxiety
- on Celexa
- started Clonazepam 0.5 mg PO BID PRN--discharged on 1mg
Clonazepam in accordance with OMR record.
.
# Hypernatremia--most likely secondary to post-acute tubular
necrosis diuresis.  Patient was given 1/2 NS and her
hypernatremia resolved.
.
# DM2 - RISS; hold metformin until discharge given recent
acidosis.
.
# BP - hypertensive at baseline, but metoprolol and lisinopril
were held during admission to prevent renal damage and b/c her
systolic BP was <120 during her stay.
.
# OSA/obesity hypoventilation - pt was maintained on inhalers
during her stay.  She was advised to continue using CPAP on
discharge.
.
# Arthritis--patient takes methadone 10mg [**Hospital1 **] at home--this was
held during hospital stay because of her altered mental status.
