History of Present Illness:
HPI: Pt is a 64 year old female with a history of Crohn's
colitis who was transferred from [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital after
she was observed to have stool discharging from the vagina. Pt
had previously been hospitalized at [**Hospital6 6689**]
numerous times for Crohn's colitis and resultant diarrhea,
deyhydration, and electrolyte abnormalities. Pt's most recent
admission at [**Location (un) **] was for Klebsiella urosepsis, which
responded well to Levoflox and IVF. During the admission, she
was clinically thought to have a vesicular-sigmoid fistula,
although this was not demonstrated on CT scan. According to OSH
records, pt may also have had feculent material which drained
from a foley cath. Due to pt's complicated clinical course
(including recent MI), she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management of her presumed vesicular-sigmoid fistula.

[**2104-6-30**] ECHO:
Preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.  Compared with the
report (images unavailable) of [**2096-12-19**], the findings are new.
LVEF 55%
Based on [**2094**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be
based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
.
RUQ U/S:
1.  Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
2.  Incidental small right pleural effusion.
.
[**2104-6-30**] SIGMOIDOSCOPY:
Opening consistent with fistula was visualized in the distal
portion of the rectum, erythema in distal descending colon
compatible with indeterminate colitis.
Descending colon mucosal biopsy:
Focal architectural distortion and Paneth cells, suggestive of
chronic inactive colitis. No granulomas or dysplasia.
.
CT C/A/P [**2104-7-9**]:
1.  There is a filling defect in the left common femoral vein
most likely representing a thrombosis.  Recommend left lower
extremity ultrasound to better characterize.
2.  There is an airspace opacity in the right middle lobe most
likely
consistent with pneumonia. Clinical correlation is suggested.
3.  There is symmetric thickening of the wall of the sigmoid
colon with pockets of diverticula without stranding of the
surrounding fat and without abscess formation. Patient has a
known diagnosis of Crohn's but given only the sigmoid
involvement and lack of asymmetry and skip lesions,
diverticulitis should also be considered.
4.  Severe left convex scoliosis of the lumbar spine.
.
LOWER EXTREMITY U/S [**2104-7-17**]:
The left common femoral vein demonstrates intraluminal thrombus
and is not
completely compressible, although it is patent.  This finding is
consistent with short-segment, nonocclusive thrombus of the
proximal left common femoral vein that does not extend into the
superficial femoral vein.  The remaining lower extremity deep
veins, namely the superficial femoral and popliteal, are patent
and compressible.  Left calf veins are also patent. The right
common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins are
widely patent, compressible and demonstrate normal venous flow
and augmentation.
.
TTE [**2104-7-18**]: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.  No
vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There is brief right atrial diastolic
collapse.  Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2104-6-30**], no major change is evident.
.
SHOULDER 1 VIEW LEFT  [**2104-7-29**] 1:55 PM
Two radiographs of the left shoulder demonstrate anatomic
alignment of the glenohumeral joint. Assessment of the
acromioclavicular joint is limited by patient positioning.
Visualized lung is clear. Of note, the two images represent a
single projection. No fracture identified. The adjacent ribs are
grossly unremarkable. Soft tissues are unremarkable.
Technologist note indicates the patient could not tolerate
additional imaging.
.
IMPRESSION:
Limited study given single angle of projection. No fracture or
dislocation demonstrated.
.
ECHO	Study Date of [**2104-7-28**]
Conclusions:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is a small (~3mm) somewhat mobile
echodensity on
the left ventricular side near the coaptation of the aortic
valve leaflets.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally
normal. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild
(1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Small, partially mobile echodensity on the aortic
valve as
described above c/w (but not diagnositic of) a vegetation. ( A
benign fibrin
strand would also be in the differential).

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US  [**2104-7-28**] 1:43 PM
LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and Doppler
ultrasound of the left internal jugular, subclavian, brachial,
basilic, and cephalic veins was performed. There is normal flow,
augmentation, compressibility, and waveforms. No
