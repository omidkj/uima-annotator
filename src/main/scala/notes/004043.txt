Status asthmaticus, vocal cord dysfunction

None

History of Present Illness:
20F h/o asthma and vocal cord dysfunction admitted in status
asthmaticus in the setting of 3 days URI symptoms. She was most
recently discharged [**2151-11-24**] after a similar asthma exacerbation.
Three days prior to presentation, she completed the prednisone
taper from that previous admission. On that same day, she
developed increased symptoms including cough, chest tightness,
and wheezing.

On ROS, she denies fevers, chills, sweats, chest pain although
does feel tightness. Frequent coughing with scant sputum
production. At home has been taking advair, combivent inhaler,
[**Doctor First Name 130**], and singulair. Today she took duonebs x3 due to
worsening of symptoms and presented to PCP for visit given her
shortness of breath. In the office was minimally wheezy but
congested and reported ambulatory stridor; peak flow was 240.
She was sent to the ED for evaluation, but decided to go to her
dorm first where she became more short of breath and notified
campus police who called EMS.

In the ED initial vitals: 99.2, 128, 138/87, 21, 99% on RA. Exam
wheezy, tachycardic, tachypnic. Given ativan, nebs, solumedrol
with no significant improvement so started on heliox which led
to subjective improvement but once removed she developed
coughing fits and subjective shortness of breath. Admitted to
the ICU for ongoing care.

Brief Hospital Course:
20F h/o asthma and vocal cord dysfunction admitted with
respiratory distress, likely secondary to status asthmaticus and
vocal cord dysfunction.

# Status asthmaticus - The patient presented in status
asthmaticus in the setting of a URI, finishing a recent
prednisone taper, and recent colder weather.  The patient was
continued on oral steroids, 60mg po daily.  Heliox was
discontinued upon patient arrival to the ICU.  She was initially
on continuous albuterol nebulizer treatments, and her lung exam
rapidly improved, though she continued to have intermittent
coughing fits.  The morning after admission, she was breathing
comfortably on RA with normal oxygen saturation and a clear lung
exam.  She was transitioned to prn xopenex nebulizer treatments
and continued on her home regimen. She was given a 5 day course
of oral azithromycin as well given the initial severity of her
symptoms. She was discharged to home to complete a prednisone
taper and to continue her home regimen.  She will have close
follow-up with her primary care physician.

# Vocal cord dysfunction - given initial concerns for stridor,
rapid resolution of her symptoms, and known past history, VCD
was thought to be a contributing factor for this flare.  This
diagnosis was discussed with [**Known firstname **], and we discussed techniques
for managing her VCD.  She was given low dose lorazepam with
good effect. She was discharged to home with a limited amount of
ativan to be used as needed.

# Depression - Her home Lamictal was continued.  No active
issues during this admission.

# Anemia ?????? Hct 34 with a slightly low MCV.  Stable from previous
admission.
