[**2198-10-12**] INR 1.2

[**2198-10-10**] Head CT : Acute subarachnoid hemorrhage overlying the
left temporal lobe and likely acute/subacute small subdural
hematoma over the right frontal lobe.

[**2198-10-10**] Bilat hips : No fracture identified. If there is
continued concern for an occult hip fracture, recommend further
evaluation with MRI.

[**2198-10-10**] Bilat knees : 1. Moderate osteoarthritis of the left knee
and severe osteoarthritis of the
right knee.
2. No definite fractures. If there is continued concern for an
occult
fracture, recommend further evaluation with CT.

[**2198-10-10**] Chest CT :
1. No evidence of intrathoracic injury.
2. Multiple pulmonary nodules measuring up to 1.5 cm, given size
and evidence of asbestos exposure, a three-month followup is
recommended. Alternatively, these could represent focal
contusions in the setting of trauma.
3. RUL ground glass opacity measuring 1.5 cm, could represent a
Bronchoalveolar carcinoma.
4. Mild pulmonary edema and small bilateral effusions.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 37557**] was evaluated by the Trauma team in the Emergency
Room and fully scanned.  She had a left temporal SAH and a
chronic right SDH but showed no evidence of any neurologic
deficit.  She received Vitamin K and FFP to reverse her INR of
2.2 which was successful.  She was admitted to the Trauma floor
for further management.

Her neurologic exam remained unchanged but she had generalized
aches and pains from her fall.  Luckily she had no broken bones
and her mental status was clear.  She was evaluated by the
Neurosurgery service both in the Emergency Room and on the floor
and they recommended keeping her INR < 1.4 and totally
discontinue Coumadin.  They also recommended a repeat head CT
but she refused the exam. Again there was no change in her exam.
Her INR on [**2198-10-12**] was 1.2.  She was able to tolerate a regular
diet though did not have much of an appetite.

Routine fingerstick blood sugars were followed as in all Trauma
patients and she had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1131**] of 240 on one occasion.  Her
serum blood sugars since admission were 120-170 range.  Her
elevated sugar may be stress related but nevertheless should be
followed.

On [**2198-10-12**] she discharged back to her nursing home and will
follow up with her PCP as needed.
