Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS: (per HPI) "84 year old
woman with known CAD (s/p BMS to RCA x 2 in '[**44**], DES to LAD
[**2-11**]), systolic HF (EF 45%), PVD (s/p bilateral LE bypass,) HTN,
RAS, PAF, who presented to an outside hospital w/ sudden onset
of SOB. Patient awoke in middle of night w/ difficulty
breathing. When EMS arrived, she was found to be hypoxic to 84%.
She was initially admitted to the ICU for CPAP, but with a
significant symptomatic improvement to lasix, she was able to
have oxygen titrated down to NC. She denies any ensuing CP prior
to the episode and had no palpitations. She denies any recent LE
swelling, premonitory SOB, or lightheadedness. Patient had a
recent hospitalization 2 weeks prior to presentation. At that
time she ruled out for MI, and was discharged following
adjustments to medication. Patient underwent a pharm neuclear
stress test, which was nondiagnostic on EKG, with failure to
show changes in baseline sinus bradycardia. There is no report
in the transfer records of elevated cardiac enzymes. Per report,
nuclear imaging showed nuclear mixed inferior defect. Patient
was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization."
.
Oon [**2150-11-11**], pt underwent a cardiac catheterization which showed
ISRS and she had 2 DES to the LAD placed. She did well post-cath
and received renal protection via bicarb and mucomyst. Her
volume status remained tenuous and she was aggressively
diuresed. However, her renal function also began to decline,
raising concern for overdiuresis. Her room air sats remained
low, though, so her outpatient lasix dose was resumed. Today,
she was given her AM dose of lasix, but her afternoon dose was
held because of her rising creatinine and her euvolemic status.
However, in the evening, the patient began to complain of
respiratory distress. Her SBP were found to be in the 160s-170s.
She was given: 60mg IV lasix (with minimal UOP), 4mg IV morphine
total, and nitroglycerin gtt at 1.4mcg/kg/min. Sats were 78% on
3-4L -> improved only to 90-92% on NRB. She was given an
additional dose of 120mg lasix IV with minimal UOP. An ABG
showed pH 7.18, pCO2 95, and pO2 94. Decision was made to
attempt BiPAP but that was unable to be performed on the floor.
The patient was minimally responsive and was using accessory
muscles of respiration. The decision was made to intubate her
for airway protection and control. She was intubated easily
(with etom/succ) and brought to the CCU for further management.
EKG performed on arrival to the SICU were concerning for ST
elevations in the precordial leads, but they resolved somewhat
with time so the decision was made to follow her enzymes and not
go to cath urgently. She remained on heparin IV overnight for
possible ACS as her troponins were elevated (but her CK was
flat).

Past Medical History:
-CAD -> multivessel s/p 2 complex angioplasties of RCA; [**2-6**] she
underwent PTCA/stenting of the mid/distal RCA; [**9-8**] LMCA had a
mild proximal stenosis, LAD had a 60% proximal stenosis at D1.
The remainder of the vessel had mild-moderate diffuse disease.
.
-The circumflex system was small with a 40% focal OM1 lesion.
The RCA had a 20% proximal stenosis. There were serial 90% and
80% focal in-stent restenotic lesions of the mid and distal
vessel. The PDA filled via collaterals from the left. Successful
PTCA of the RCA was performed using a 3.0x15 mm cutting balloon
proximally and a 2.5x15 mm cutting balloon distally. There was
20% residual stenosis in the mid-RCA and 10% distally with
normal flow and no apparent dissection.
.
-DES to LAD in [**2-11**]
