Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2160**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R-sided thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
82 M w/ A fib (not on coumadin), dyslipidemia, hypertension,
alzheimer's disease, who presents with fatigue, cough, slurred
speech and a question of a right facial droop. Neurology
examined patient in ED and thought he was non-focal, facial
droop may be old. Pt also had CXR showing large right pleural
effusion. While in [**Name (NI) **] Pt desatted to 80s on NRB. Deep suctioning
resulted in his sats returning to 90s on high flow face mask.
Patient also had CT revealing near complete collapse of RML &
RLL. Patient was admitted to the ICU for monitoring and he did
not require intubation or pressors.

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2137-2-12**] 10:19 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Remote infarct of the right occipital lobe and possible
additional lacunar infarctions as described.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2137-2-12**] 9:42 PM
IMPRESSION: Large right pleural effusion. An underlying
consolidation or other process is not excluded
.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2137-2-13**] 12:01 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Near complete collapse of the right lower and middle lobes,
with retained secretions seen in the right main bronchus and
throughout the right-sided airways. Bronchoscopy is recommended
as the patient is at risk for complete right-sided collapse, in
order to clear secretions and to exclude a fixed obstructing
lesion. Findings discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1022**] at 3 p.m., [**2-13**], [**2136**].
2. Possible aspirated contrast noted within the right lower
lobe.
3. Likely right renal cyst.
.
RENAL U.S.  [**2137-2-13**] 12:10 PM
IMPRESSION: Limited study demonstrating no hydronephrosis on
either side.
Right renal atrophy.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2137-2-13**] 5:05 AM
IMPRESSION: No short interval change, with large right pleural
effusion.
.
 ECHO Study Date of [**2137-2-13**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.  No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall  thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity size is top  normal/borderline
dilated. There is global hypokinesis with moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction (septal, anterior and
apical near  akinesis). No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. There is no  ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.  Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. The
ascending aorta  is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There  is no signficant aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.  The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a
restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2137-2-14**] 1:53 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. No significant interval change to moderate-sized right
pleural effusion and atelectasis of right middle and right lower
lobes.
2. Persistent mild pulmonary edema.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2137-2-15**] 4:26 PM
IMPRESSION: Status post right thoracentesis, with small right
pleural effusion persisting. No pneumothorax.
.
MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2137-2-15**] 8:37 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute infarct.
2. Right occipital encephalomalacic changes and chronic
microvessel disease and bilateral centrum semiovale.
3. Atherosclerotic disease involving right distal vertebral,
bilateral MCA with possible mid basilar, short segment moderate
stenosis. To consider CT angiogram for better evaluation of
these vessels, as this study is limited in accurate assessment
due to artifacts.

Culture: No growth to date


Brief Hospital Course:
82 M w/ COPD who presents with O2 desaturation in setting of
large right pleural effusion s/p large volume R thoracentesis.

RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Probably some component of mucous plug
given RLL & RML with retained bronchial secretions.  Patient is
s/p thoracentesis, which he tolerated well and has been off
oxygen since. Etiology of large R-sided pleural effusion is
unclear, but may be secondary to chronic parapneumonic effusion
as a result of chronic aspiration.  Patient was initially
treated with Vancomycin/Levo/Flagyl that was subsequently
tailored to just Levofloxacin.  His pleural fluid was no growth
to date at the time of discharge.  His sputum culture grew out
MRSA and he was started on bactrim in preparation for discharge
and azithromycin for atypicals.  The patient was also treated
with standing albuterol and ipratropium and progressed well
throughout the hospital course.  His O2 sat became greatly
improved s/p thoracocentesis and at the time of discharge he was
satting well on room air and during ambulation.
.
ARF: Patient with increased Creatinine from baseline that
resolved with hydration.  FeNA was < 1% suggesting pre-renal
etiology.  This was follow throughout the hospital course and
constant lab values with Cr of 1.3 suggests that patient may
have a new baseline.
.
CARDIAC:
- Ischemia - Patient without history of CAD, although does have
hx of afib, and patient not on coumadin, perhaps he was thought
to be a fall risk. Continued patient on aspirin & statin.
- Pump - EF 30% - Continued Carvediolol & lisinopril.  He was
evaluated for ICD placement by EP give low EF and brief episode
of 9 beat NSVT that was asymptomatic.  EP recommended no ICD
placement at this time given dementia and comorbidities.  ICD
placement can be reevaluated as an outpatient.
- Rhythm - Patient with hx of afib, not on Coumadin. Carvedilol
was continued for rate control. Monitored on telemetry and
patient has some NSVT and was bradycardic at times, although
asymptomatic with both rhythms.  As above, patient was evaluated
by EP and he is not a candidate for ICD at this time.
.
NEURO CHANGES: no focal deficits on exam. Patient with hx of
stroke, not currently on aggrenox.  Patient with MRI negative
for acute stroke (results above)
.
ALZHEIMERS:
--continued Aricept
.
GERD
--Continued Ranitidine
.
After discussion with the patient and the medical staff, and
physical therapy, all were in agreement that [**Known firstname 449**] [**Known lastname 15273**] was a
suitable candidate for discharge.

Medications on Admission:
