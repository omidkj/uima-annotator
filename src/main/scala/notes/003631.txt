Brief Hospital Course:
58yo M with a hx of systolic (EF 20-25%) and grade 4 diastolic
heart failure, ESRD [**2-15**] DM on HD, atrial fibrillation with RVR,
severe depression, and recent crack cocaine use presents with
hyperkalemia to 7.4 and atrial fibrillation with RVR to 150s in
the setting of missing dialysis for the past week. Of note,
patient has had a long history of missing dialysis sessions.
.
Upon presentation to ED, patient was treated for hyperkalemia
with 2 grams calcium gluconate, dextrose, IV regular insulin,
30g kayexalate, and bicarb. Renal was consulted and urgent HD
was [**Month/Day (2) 1988**] for [**8-18**] in the early a.m. hours and approximately
1 Liter of fluid was removed.  Cardiology was also consulted for
afib with RVR and recommended IV labetalol, which converted him
back into SR in the 110s. During his stay in the unit, pt
remained rate controlled in the 90s-110s and was NSr at time of
transfer to the general medical floor. Patient was resumed on
his home dose of Labetalol.
.
Lisinopril was initially held due to hyperkalemia setting but
plan was to resume his oupatient dose once discharged. Potassium
this morning, [**8-19**], was K 4.0  and team felt comfortable
switching patient back to his Ace-inhibitor.  Additional ESRD
medications, cinacalcet and sevelamer were also continued for
electrolyte/Phos level control.
.
During admission, the patient also complained of intermittent
non-radiating chest pressure. SL Nitro was given with no effect.
Pain episodes would eventually resolve without intervention.
Repeat EKGs showed no change from admission, and no new
ischemia/infarction. The pain was reproducible on physical exam
at the lower edge of xiphoid and epigastric region and responded
to Maalox and it was felt that these complaints were large GI
related vs. cardiac. He continued to have chest pain while on
the floor, and again it was relieved with tylenol and maalox,
thought to be more GI related at that time.
.
Patient was discharged from recent hospital stay on [**8-10**] with C.
Diff colitis and still has about a week left of his Flagyl
therapy. Patient continues to c/o daily diarrhea at this time
but the frequency has decreased. Flagyl was continued during
this admission.  He had three days left of treatment at the time
of discharge.
.
The patient has a history of DM-2 and was initially placed on
Humalog sliding scale after acute presentation. Now that patient
has stabilized he can return to his usual NPH daily schedule of
15 Units a.m. and 10 Units p.m.
.
For his history of depression he was continued on daily Zoloft
home dose.
.
On the floor, he was seen by a social work to address his
absence from dialysis the week before admission.  He obviously
has insight into the medical problems it causes, but continues
to do crack cocaine and miss his sessions.  He has an
appointment at the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to follow up his substance
abuse and was discharged with goals of staying sober and
attending all his dialysis sessions.  He will continue his Tues,
Thurs, Sat schedule as an outpatient.
