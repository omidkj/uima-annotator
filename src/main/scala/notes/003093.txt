Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Suprapubic pain on Initial Presentation.
Admitted to the ICU because of Dyspnea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o female with history of CAD s/p CABG, HTN,
Hypercholesterolemia,
and atrial fibrillation who was in her USOH until 1 wk before
presentation when she developed intermittent epigastric
tenderness she believes began after an episode of vomiting
(perhaps associated with taking a medication).  Since then, she

CXR [**8-28**]: Relative to the prior examination, there is mild
engorgement of the vascular structures with mild cephalization.
No overt failure is evident. There has, however, been interval
increase in the bilateral pleural effusions previously noted.
There is a tortuous atherosclerotic aorta. The cardiac
silhouette again is enlarged but stable. The bones are diffusely
osteopenic with a severely exaggerated kyphosis of the thoracic
spine again seen.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2107-8-28**]  2:41:48 PM
Baseline artifact
Sinus rhythm
Atrial premature complexes
Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T abnormalities
Delayed R wave progression - could be due in part to left
ventricular
hypertrophy or prior septal myocardial infarction
Since previous tracing of [**2107-7-20**], probably no significant
change
.
Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2107-8-31**]
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
11-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. LV systolic function appears
moderately-to-severely depressed (ejection fraction 30 percent)
secondary to hypokinesis of the anterior septum, anterior free
wall, and apex. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is focal hypokinesis
of the apical free wall of the right ventricle. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2089-12-16**], the mitral
regurgitation is increased; mild aortic stenosis is now present.

RENAL US [**2107-9-6**]
No appropriate demonstration of diastolic arterial flow in
either kidney, suggestive of increased resistive indices which
can be seen in the setting of renal artery stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o Female with PMHx of CAD s/p CABG, CHF (EF 35%), HTN,
Hypercholesterolemia, and atrial fibrillation who presented with
suprapubic pain, with a negative urine culture spontaneous
resolution. She then developed respiratory distress requiring
tranfer to ICU without intubation (she is DNR/DNI). She was
transfered from the MICU to the CCU for treatment of heart
failure and possible need for catheterization, which was
untimately not required.

1. Abdominal Pain NOS: Unclear etiology, may potentially be
related to episode of vomiting vs mild gastritis.  Spontaneously
resolved.  U/A negative for cystitis. No further traetment
needed.

2. Respiratory Distress: Likely systolic heart failure and may
have had some component of flash pulmonary edema. Off oxygen
with good O2 saturations.

3. Pneumonia: Completed a seven day course for community
acquired PNA with antibiotics (Ceftriaxone).

3. Systolic Heart Failure: Baseline EF 35%, elevated BNP to 35K
(prior baseline 5-7K), and evidence of CHF. Repeat Echo showed
EF 30% with hypokinesis of the anterior septum, anterior free
wall, and apex. Continued on low dose beta blocker.  Ace
inhibitor was held due to renal insufficiency and possible renal
artery stenosis on renal ultrasound.  Please consider restarting
once creatinine comes down for afterload reduction.  Patient has
shown labile blood pressure, and per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] will revisit
staring ACE as an outpatient.

4. CAD s/p CABG: Concern for prior ischemic espisode given
anterior wall motion abnormality. Continue ASA, low dose
metoprolol. ACE held for likely RAS, which can be restarted if
Cr is returning to normal.

5. HTN - Stopped ACE because of concermn for renal artery
stenosis. Beta blocker continued at 2 mg [**Hospital1 **].

6. Afib - Currently in NSR with occassional ATach. Decision was
made to stop anticoagulation because of fall risk based on PT
evaluation.

7. Transaminitis: Resolved despite being on amiodarone. Will
need to be followed while on amiodarone.
