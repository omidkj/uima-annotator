History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo female w/ CHF, AFib, h/o breast CA s/p mastectomy and
small bowel leiosarcoma p/w to the PCP's office yesterday with
SOB and hypoxia, though to have a CHF exacerbation. Lasix was
increased to 120mg last night from 80mg per her PCP and she
diuresed 3lb overnight. Her family reports that over the last
days she had worsening DOE and and a cough at night. Then over
the last two days she had worsening SOB. She denies any PND or
increasing nocturia. She also denies any pain swallowing, ear
pain, nasal discharge, f/c/ns, but reports a productive cough
(clear sputum) mostly at night.

[**2183-4-4**] CXR
IMPRESSION: No pneumonia or overt failure noted.
.
CTA Chest [**2183-4-4**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2. Mild pulmonary edema.
3. Vague lingular air-space opacity may represent infection.
4. Multiple lung nodules, the largest being a 9 x 8 mm right
lower lobe nodule. Recommend three- month followup to ensure
stability if clinically indicated.
5. Small pericardial effusion.
6. Small right pleural effusion.
7. 7-mm right renal stone.
.
CT Abdomen Pelvis [**2183-4-8**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Large right anterior abdominal wall/flank hematoma. Findings
called to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6382**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6383**] at approximately 4:15 pm on
[**2183-4-8**].
2. No evidence of acute intra-abdominal hemorrhage.
2. Small right pleural effusion and associated atelectasis or
pneumonia in the right lower lobe.
3. Bilateral nephrolithiasis without evidence of obstruction.
4. Heavy atherosclerotic calcifications.
5. Moderate bladder distention. Consider Foley catheter
placement.
.
CXR [**2183-4-8**]
FINDINGS: Compared with [**2183-4-8**], there has been interval partial
clearing of the pulmonary edema as well as the retrocardiac
atelectasis. There is now some focal linear atelectasis at the
right lung base.
.
ECHO [**2183-4-7**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. A secundum type atrial septal defect is
present. A prominent eustachian valve vs  a right atrial
membrane is seen. There is no evidence of obstruction to RA
inflow. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.  There is mild
aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may
be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with CHF, AFib, who presented
with shortness of breath and hypoxia and was found to have
influenza B infection, a UTI, diarrhea, had a paradoxical
reaction to heparin that resulted in an abdominal wall hematoma,
hypotension and a HCT drop requiring transfusion of unit PRBC
and a one night stay in the MICU.  These issues have resolved
and the patient is now no longer dependant on oxygen, her
diarrhea has resolved and her hematocrit is stable at her
baseline.
.
1. CHF: The patient came in on a digoxin, Lopressor, lasix and
enalapril.  She ruled out for MI. Initially the digoxin and
lopressor doses were increased as the patient was noted to be in
AFib with RVR.  However, when the patient dropped her HCT and
pressure in the setting of her reaction to sub-cutaneous heparin
all of her blood pressure medications were held.  When the
patient was transferred out of the unit her betablocker was
reinstated on her home dose.  Digoxin and enalapril were
reinstated at her home dose.  The patient will be discharged on
lasix 100mg daily.  This is a decrease from the 100mg qam/120mg
qpm that she was on at admission.
.
2. Hypoxia: At first we were weighing whether this was secondary
to Influenza infection (She had a positive DFA for Influenza B)
vs a CHF flare.  Since the patient's symptoms had been going on
for greater than two weeks per her daughter we did not start
[**Name (NI) 15630**].  CHF was treated as above.  The patient's hypoxia was
treated with supplemental oxygen and had resolved by the day of
discharge.
-She remained stable on 2L NC
-Infection control stated that she should remain on droplet
precautions for 7 days from the start of her symptoms.
- ipratropium standing and PRN.
.
3. Afib: poorly rate controlled on admission, not
anticoagulated, Digoxin level low on admission.  Betablocker and
digoxin were at first increased and then decreased based on the
patient's hemodynamic complications noted above.  She will be
discharged on the same dosage of these medications that she came
in on.
.
4. ARF: Likely secondary to prerenal etiology given diarrhea and
hypotension.  This resolved to baseline by the day of discharge.

.
5. UTI: +UA with culture positive for enterococcus.  She was on
bactrim for three days and switched to amoxicillin on [**4-7**] (today
- day 5) based on sensitivities.  Will send on two more days
bactrim.
