Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain, SOB

History of Present Illness:
48 yoM with PMH HIV, HTN, HLD presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital with
complaints of chest pain and SOB and found to have STEMI and new
mitral regurgitation. According to the patient, he began feeling
lower back pain and associated burning chest pain [**11-24**], he
identified the symptoms as acid reflux and used tums for
symptomatic relief with good effect. Throughout the following
week, he had daily symptoms with increasing severity and
frequency until the day of admission when he developed [**10-5**]
burning chest pain radiating to the neck and arms. He became
acutely short of breath and nauseated after taking baking soda
for the burning chest pain he vomited 1x and called 911.
Throughout the duration of these symptoms, he notes that the
pain was neither worsened by activity nor improved with rest. He
denies chest pressure, palpatations, presyncope, changes in
vision.

On arrival to the [**Hospital **] Hospital ED initial EKG showed afib
with RVR, and ST-E in III and aVF, ST-D in I, aVL, V2-5, he was
anticoagulated with heparin, given anti-aggregation therapy with
plavix and integrilin drip. He was given an amiodarone bolus for
arrythmia prophylaxis. He was given atorvastatin 80mg for CAD,
diltiazem for afib with RVR. Furosemide 20mg IV for pulmonary
edema. He underwent emergent cardiac catheritization with BMS to
the RCA. LV gram showed significant MR. [**First Name (Titles) 6**] [**Last Name (Titles) 49660**] was placed. He
was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of [**Hospital1 49660**] and evaluation
for mitral valve repair.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU, his VS were bp95/71 p115 99% NRB. EKG
showed Sinus tachycardia at 112, STD in I, aVL, V3-5, STE III,
when compared to EKG from saints hospital, depressions and
elevations appear less pronounced. He reported [**2-5**] buring chest
pain, SOB and cough.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Physical Exam:
On admission:
GENERAL: Middle aged male, appearing anxious but in NAD
HEENT: Mucous membs dry, conjuntiva pink.
NECK: JVP non elevatedcm.
CARDIAC: II/VI holosystolic blowing murmur at the apex. No
thrills, lifts. No S3 or S4.
LUNGS: Right rales to the mid back, left basilar rales. No
ronchi, no wheezes
ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND. No HSM or tenderness. Abd aorta not
enlarged by palpation. AIBP ascultated
EXTREMITIES: Right AIBP sheath in place with no ecchymosis or
erythemia, no drainage.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
PULSES:
Right:  DP 1+ PT 1+
Left: DP 1+ PT 1+

Pertinent Results:
[**12-2**] TTE: The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
inferior/inferolateral and basal inferoseptal
akinesis/hypokinesis with hyperdynamic motion elsewhere although
views are suboptimal for assessment of regional wall. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 55
%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular function
is not well seen but may be depressed. The aortic valve is not
well seen. There is posterior mitral leaflet flail with ruptured
inferolateral papillary muscle. An eccentric medially directed
jet of at least moderate mitral regurgitation is present but
cannot be quantified to due suboptimal views. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in
the presence of elevated right sided pressures.

[**12-2**] TEE: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(regional wall motino was not fully assessed). There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. There is flail of the
posterior leaflet of the mitral valve with attached ruptured
papillary muscle. Eccentric anteromedially directed severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

Final Report
CHEST RADIOGRAPH

INDICATION: Status post CABG, pneumothorax after chest tube
removal.

COMPARISON: [**2166-12-2**].

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, all monitoring
and support
devices, including the intra-aortic balloon pump, has been
removed. Given the
positioning of the patient, the right hemithorax looks slightly
denser than on
the left, which might in part reflect pre-existing pulmonary
edema that has
decreased in severity.

No evidence of pneumothorax. No pleural effusions. Borderline
size of the
cardiac silhouette, no pulmonary edema.




Brief Hospital Course:
48M transferredfrom OSH c/o CP and SOB, found to have STEMI and
new MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **]
was in rapid a-fib, treated with amiodarone and diltiazem.  He
was given plavix and started on integrillin (asa allergy).  He
was diuresed for pulmonary edema.  Emergent cardiac cath was
performed and he received a BMS to RCA.  LV gram showed
significant MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) 49660**] was placed.  He is transferred for
surgical
evaluation.   TEE revealed  severe (4+) mitral regurgitation. On
[**12-2**] he was taken to the operating room and underwent Coronary
artery bypass grafting x1 with reverse
 saphenous vein graft to the posterior left ventricular branch
artery and  2. Mitral valve repair with a posterior P2
quadrangular  resection and annuloplasty with a [**Company 1543**] CG
Future annuloplasty ring, model #638R, size 28 mm.
Post operatively he was transferred to the ICU intubated and
sedated for hemodynamic care and monitoring. He awoke
neuologically intact and was weaned from the vemtilator and
extubated. On POD#1 his [**Company 49660**] was removed. He was staretd back on
plavix and ASA was not started due to allergy to ASA. His
betablocker was titrated and he was diuresed toward his
pre-operative weight. His chest tubes and pacing wires were
removed per protocol. He was seen by physical therapy for
strngth and conditioning. He was cleared for discharge to home
on POD#4 by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. All appointments and di
