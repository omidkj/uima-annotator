Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Diarrhea, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right Internal Jugular Venous Line [**2182-10-28**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year old woman with history of chronic
diarrhea, sarcoid, and atrial fibrillation who presented to the
ED this afternoon with hypotension. She went to her scheduled GI
appointment the afternoon of admission at which time her blood
pressure was found to be 80/40. She was referred to the ED for
further workup.
.
She notes that for the past several weeks, she has felt weaker
and has been less able to move around. She reports that she has
lost > 60 pounds since her diarrhea began in [**Month (only) 216**].  She has
had some nausea, long-standing diarrhea which occurs with any
food, and long-standing dyspnea on exertion. She was recently
treated for a UTI with a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin,
completed 2-3 days ago. She denies current urinary symptoms.
.
In the ED, her vitals were: BP 81/46, HR 70, RR 16, Sat 100%RA.
Her potassium was elevated at 6.1, and she was given calcium
gluconate, dextrose, bicarb, and insulin, along with kayexalate.
Blood cultures were drawn, and she was given dose of
ceftriaxone. In the context of hypotension, hyponatremia, and
hyperkalemia, she was treated for presumed adrenal insufficiency
and given dexamethasone 10mg x 1. Her blood pressure initially
responded to 2L NS with systolic blood pressures in the 110's,
but then it decreased to 80's systolic. She received 4 more
liters of normal saline. A central line was placed. Blood
cultures were drawn, U/A showed moderate leukocyte esterase, and
CXR was negative; she was given one dose of ceftriaxone.
.

STUDIES:
=========
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2182-10-28**]
FINDINGS: Supine AP chest radiograph is obtained. A single-lead
pacer device overlies the right chest with lead tip positioned
in the approximate location of the right ventricle. The lungs
appear clear bilaterally, demonstrating no evidence of pneumonia
or CHF. No pleural effusion is seen. Right apical pleural
thickening is again noted. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
stable. The visualized osseous structures are intact.
IMPRESSION:
No pneumonia.
.
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2182-10-28**]
FINDINGS: Single bedside AP examination labeled "supine" is
compared with similar examination obtained some 4.5 hours
earlier. There has been interval placement of a right internal
jugular double-lumen central venous catheter with its tip at the
cavo-atrial junction and no supine evidence of pneumothorax. The
overall appearance of the lungs is unchanged, with right more
than left apical pleuroparenchymal scarring but no definite
focal consolidation. The heart size and pulmonary vessels are
probably unchanged with no posteriorly-layering pleural
effusion. The right-sided unipolar cardiac pacemaker has intact
lead with its tip projected over the RV apex (on this single
view).
.
EKG [**2182-10-28**]
Ventricular paced rhythm. Compared to tracing of [**2182-8-23**] no
significant
change.
TRACING #1
.
EKG [**2182-10-29**]
Ventricular paced rhythm. Compared to tracing #1 on [**2182-10-28**] no
significant change.
TRACING #2
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2182-10-31**]
Heart is moderately enlarged, with particular left atrial
dilatation, and both heart size and mediastinal vascular
congestion have increased since supine images taken on [**10-28**]. There has also been an increase in pulmonary vascular
caliber but no pulmonary edema. Lateral view shows small
bilateral pleural effusion, probably new. No focal pulmonary
abnormality is present. Transvenous right ventricular pacer lead
follows the expected course. No pneumothorax.
.
SMALL BOWEL ONLY (BARIUM)  [**2182-11-4**]
FINDINGS: Scout KUB is unremarkable, with incidentally noted 6
mm soft tissue calcification overlying the distal tip of the
coccyx, likely correlating with a pelvic phlebolith on CT from
9/[**2181**]. Barium passes freely through the small bowel, entering
the colon within approximately 35 minutes, relatively faster
than expected. Small bowel caliber, contour, and mucosal pattern
are normal. The terminal ileum is unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Normal small bowel with relatively fast transit of
barium.
