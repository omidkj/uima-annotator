Admission Date:  [**2113-11-27**]       Discharge Date:  [**2113-12-8**]


Service:  CCU

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Decompensated congestive heart
failure, admitted for inotropic therapy

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is an 87-year-old
woman, admitted from Heart Failure Clinic, originally to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service on [**2112-11-26**] with decompensated congestive heart
failure.  The patient had recently been discharged from [**Hospital1 1444**] following admission from
[**11-8**] to [**2113-11-15**] for loss of consciousness.  That admission,
she had had episodes of bradycardia to the 20s despite having
her beta blocker and Digoxin withheld.  Ultimately she had a
VVI pacemaker placed.  After a brief stay at rehabilitation,
she returned to her [**Hospital3 **] facility.  While at home,
she reports increased lower extremity edema and weight gain.
Her exercise tolerance was difficult for her to assess, as
she was essentially inactive during that time.  She denied
any chest pain, however.  She went to Congestive Heart
Failure Clinic the day of admission and was noted to have
hypotension and increased fluid overload, and so was admitted
for treatment of her congestive heart failure.

She was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service and begun on
dopamine at 3 mcg/kg/minute.  That night, she had multiple
runs of ventricular tachycardia, but did demonstrate an
improvement in her blood pressure initially.  She was
asymptomatic during the runs of ventricular tachycardia,
which were mostly nonsustained.  The dopamine was
discontinued, however, due to her concern for provoking this
arrhythmia.

On [**2113-11-28**], she was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit
service for closer monitoring during treatment of her
congestive heart failure.  At the time of admission to the
Coronary Care Unit, she had no complaint other than her usual
shortness of breath.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2102**]
2.  Congestive heart failure, left ventricular ejection
fraction 45%, with 3+ mitral regurgitation, 3+ tricuspid
regurgitation
3.  Chronic atrial fibrillation
4.  Bradycardia status post VVI pacer
5.  Pulmonary hypertension secondary to valvular heart
disease
6.  Chronic renal insufficiency
7.  Breast cancer status post right mastectomy
8.  Status post lung resection for lung cancer
9.  Gout

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Aspirin 81 mg per day, Digoxin
0.125 mg per day, Lisinopril 2.5 mg per day, metoprolol 12.5
mg twice a day, simvastatin 20 mg daily, Protonix 40 mg once
daily, allopurinol 100 mg per day, calcium carbonate 500 mg
three times a day, Tylenol and dopamine which was on hold at
the time of transfer.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a nonsmoker, does not drink,
lives in an [**Hospital3 **] facility.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Revealed no chest pain.  She said that
here breathing was "okay" at the time of transfer.  She did
report increased lower extremity edema, denied any fevers or
chills.  She did complain of non-bloody diarrhea for
approximately one week, having multiple episodes per day.  Of
note, she had recently been on a course of levofloxacin for a
urinary tract infection.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer to the Coronary Care Unit,
temperature was 95.0, heart rate 70s to 90s, blood pressure
80s to 100/40s to 60s, oxygen saturation 95% on 2 liters.
Her weight was 92.4 kg.  In general, she was alert, very
pleasant.  She did not appear dyspneic.  Her head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat examination revealed anicteric sclerae.
Her mucous membranes were dry.  She had 2+ carotid upstrokes
with no bruits.  Her lungs revealed crackles at the bases
bilaterally, but were otherwise clear.  Her cardiac
examination revealed jugular venous pressure at the level of
her earlobes.  Her point of maximal impulse was displaced
laterally.  She had a normal S1 and S@, which were obscured
by loud systolic murmurs at both the right sternal border and
the apex.  She also had an S3.  Abdominal examination was
mildly distended and tympanitic, with normal active bowel
sounds.  It was nontender.  Her extremities had 4+ pitting
edema to above the knee.

LABORATORY DATA:  Chem 7 was remarkable only for her BUN and
creatinine of 97 and 2.6 respectively.  Her hematocrit at the
time of transfer was 30.1, and her INR 4.4.
Electrocardiograms revealed ventricular tachycardia at a rate
of approximately 140, with marked left axis deviation.
Telemetry also revealed wide complex tachycardia, consistent
with ventricular tachycardia, occurring in short runs.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular:  This patient with severe longstanding
valvular cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure was
admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for further inotropic
therapy with dopamine.  Because of frequent runs of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and additional ectopy,
she was also started on a lidocaine drip at 1 mg/minute,
which very effectively suppressed her ventricular tachycardia
as well as her ectopy.

Because of the patient's history of mastectomy on the right
and current diarrhea, and the pacemaker on her left side,
central access was difficulty and, approaching the patient
regarding attaining central access, she declined.  Her
dopamine was titrated up as high as 2.5 mcg/kg/minute to
maintain her mean arterial pressures and in order to increase
her renal perfusion, and she did have an improvement in her
creatinine from a peak of 2.6 down to 2.3 after only two days
on the dopamine therapy.

On [**2113-11-30**], a Digoxin level was checked, which returned at
2.1, so her Digoxin was held for a couple of days while the
level normalized.

During her stay in the Coronary Care Unit, the patient also
developed a gastrointestinal bleed, which will be covered in
the next section of this dictation.  However, because of her
gastrointestinal bleed, she required multiple transfusions of
blood products, including packed red blood cells and fresh
frozen plasma, leading to worsening of her congestive heart
failure.  She was diuresed repeatedly with lasix on an as
needed basis, though care was taken because of her low
pressures, usually with systolics in the 80s to 90s despite
the dopamine.

On [**2113-11-30**], the lidocaine was discontinued as the patient had
been on it for greater than 48 hours continuously.  She had
frequent ectopy on telemetry, but no runs of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia, so the lidocaine was held for the
remainder of her hospital stay.

On [**2113-12-2**], after the patient had had a difficult time with
the gastrointestinal bleed, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**] had a long discussion
with the patient and her family regarding her prognosis and
her potential quality of life after this admission.  It was
decided at that time to stop the dopamine and administer
intravenous fluids to see how her body would equilibrate on
its own and to "let nature take its course," per the
patient's wishes.  Therefore, on [**2113-12-2**], the dopamine was
stopped, and half-normal saline was initiated at 75 cc/hour.
Off the dopamine, the patient's blood pressures remained in
the 80s and 90s systolic, with mean arterial pressures in the
60s and 70s.

On [**2113-12-4**], the patient was called out of the Coronary Care
Unit to the general medical floor, and on [**2113-12-5**],
aminophylline was added to the patient's regimen in order to
help to achieve further inotropia and possibly renovascular
dilatation, as her creatinine had risen again to 2.5 after
reaching a low point of 2.0 on [**2113-12-2**].  In addition to
adding aminophylline, her Digoxin dose was increased in order
to run at a level closer to the higher level of therapeutic
range of 2.0 in order to achieve the maximal inotropic effect
of the drug.

The following day, the aminophylline was increased to 200 mg
three times a day, and the patient was given metolazone in
addition to 120 mg of twice a day by mouth lasix for
diuresis, which she appeared to respond well to.  She began
to make more urine and, on the day prior to discharge, the
patient was negative 1 liter, and her weight down to 81 kg
from
