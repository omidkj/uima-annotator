Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3507**]
Chief Complaint:
Kidney Stone, UTI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left ureteroscopy, stent placement ([**4-15**])
Left ureteroscopy, laser lithotripsy ([**4-18**])
Stent removal ([**4-28**])
PICC PLACEMENT

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yoF w/ h/o CAD s/p MI and recent urosepsis (pan-sensitive
Ecoli and Proteus) in [**1-/2168**] in the setting of a renal stone. At
that time, a ureteral stent was placed and she was treated with
antibiotics. She returned [**4-15**] for a planned lithotripsy; the
ureteral stent was removed with drainage of pus. The planned
lithotripsy was aborted in [**Month (only) 956**].  She was seen by urology at
that time, had ureteral stent placed, and treated with
ceftriaxone. She had a known renal stone but due to her
precarious health she was discharged with cipro and bactrim for
plan to follow up for lithotripsy. She returned to the hospital
on Friday for scheduled procedure and while in OR when they
stented past the stone, pus flowed from the kidney. The planned
lithotripsy was aborted, a new stent was placed, and she was
admitted to the urology service for IV antibiotics. She returned
to the OR [**4-18**] and underwent a laser lithotripsy and new left
ureteral stent placement. In the PACU she became hypertensive,
tachycardic, and febrile. She was started on esmolol drip,
covered with CTX/daptomycin (for resistent E. coli and
enterococcus in urine) and admitted to the ICU. She subsequently
became hypotensive/septic, requiring multiple fluid boluses and
transient pressors (peripheral dopa). She was subsequently
changed to ampicillin alone based on [**Last Name (un) 36**] of E.
coli/enterococcus. ICU course also notable for low-grade
fungemia, for which she was started on caspofungin, and hypoxia
attributed to CHF. Etiology of Fungemia unclear, ?related to
A-line placement.  Optho consulted, no evidence of fungal
infection in eye.

Past Medical History:

5. OA
6. Gout
7. Osteoporosis
8. Glaucoma s/p bilat eye surgeries
9. Dysphagia with liquids (drinks prethickened liquids)
10. Dementia

Social History:
The patient lives at [**Hospital3 2558**]. She is DNR/DNI. No tobacco,
ETOH, or drugs.
No family, has POA: [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 92883**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 92884**].


Family History:
Noncontributory

Physical Exam:
98.4, bpc 180/100, HR 112, 85% RA, 95% 4L by face mask  (On
arrival to UNIT)
Gen: elderly female, agitated, tachypnic
HEENT: anicteric, normal conjunctiva, moist mucous membranes,
surgical pupils bilaterally
Cardiac: distant heart sounds, tachycardic, regular
Pulm: Decreased LS at bases bilaterally L>R with overlying
crackless
Abd: NABS, soft, (+) mildly distended
Ext: trace LE edema bilaterally
Skin: small ulcer right ankle
Neuro: Moving all 4 extremities, symmetric face, (+) gag


Pertinent Results:
([**2168-4-18**] CXR: Mild right lower lobe discoid atelectasis and left
mid lung linear atelectasis. Otherwise, unremarkable chest
radiograph.
.
[**2168-4-18**] ECG: Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Left
bundle-branch block. Since the previous tracing of [**2168-4-12**] no
significant change.
.
[**2168-4-19**] CXR: New nasogastric tube ends in the stomach. Urinary
drainage catheter projects over the left renal bed. Small left
pleural effusion may have developed since [**4-18**], and
pulmonary vascular engorgement suggests volume overload. Heart
size is top normal. Thoracic aorta is tortuous but not acutely
changed. No pneumothorax.
.
[**2168-4-20**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (ejection fraction 30-40 percent) secondary to global
hypokinesis with some regional variation. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.  Compared with
the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-2-6**], no major change is evident, but the technically suboptimal
nature of both studies precludes definitive comparison.
.
[**2168-4-22**] CXR: Worsened volume status with cardiogenic edema and
bilateral pleural effusions.
.
[**2168-4-25**] PICC PLACEMENT: Successful repositioning of right-sided
PICC line with tip now residing in the distal superior vena
cava. The line is now ready for use.
.
[**2168-4-26**] CXR: Compared with [**2168-4-25**] at 10:00 a.m., the right arm
PICC line has been repositioned and its tip now projects at the
mid SVC level.
Lung volumes are now significantly lower and there is patchy
atelectasis/infiltrate at the bases bilaterally. Possible left
pleural effusion.The mid and upper lung fields are clear, and
the pulmonary vascular engorgement has essentially cleared.
