Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6088**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal aortic aneurysm

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2126-8-15**]
1. Open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm with
    retroperitoneal approach using the bifurcated
    aortobifemoral graft.
2. Bilateral groin cutdowns.
3. Left profunda endarterectomy.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery
disease and atrial fibrillation with recent CVA while
subtherapeutic on Coumadin, now with demonstrated progression of
previously-identified abdominal aortic aneurysm from 5 cm in

PATIENT IDENTIFICATION:  This is a 76-year-old male with a
history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation
with recent CVA while subtherapeutic on Coumadin, now with
demonstrated progression of previously-identified abdominal
aortic aneurysm from 5 cm in [**2121**] to 6.5 cm on most recent
assessment. The patient was consented for open repair of
abdominal aortic aneurysm with retroperitoneal approach.  He is
not a an EVAR candidate because of inadequate diameter, heavily
calcified iliac vessels.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  After informed consent was obtained,
the patient was brought to the operating room and placed
supine on the operating room table. After administration of
both vancomycin and gentamicin IV and application of
sequential compression stockings induction of general
anesthesia was performed. The patient was positioned in right
lateral decubitus position with the pelvis left as flat as
reasonably possible and was then shaved, prepped and
draped in the usual sterile fashion. Bilateral groin
incisions were performed in longitudinal fashion with
simultaneous dissection performed at each groin initially
utilizing electrocautery through the overlying soft tissues.
Utilizing Metzenbaum scissors, the common femoral profunda
femoris and superficial femoral arteries were identified.
Both proximal and distal control was achieved utilizing
encircling vessel loops at each branch vessel. Significant
calcification was noted at the left superficial femoral
artery consistent with known SFA occlusion with
remaining patent left profunda femoris artery, also heavily
calcified.  Initial dissection under inguinal ligament was also
started.

Attention was then turned to the left flank/subcostal
incision which was performed extending from the 11th rib to the
lateral border
of the rectus abdominis muscle. Dissection was performed
utilizing electrocautery through the soft tissues down to the
level of the peritoneum which was then carefully retracted
utilizing blunt dissection in a medial-to-lateral and both
inferior and superior fashion with careful retraction of the
intraperitoneal contents anteriorly.  A small rent in the
peritoneum was identified and primarily repaired. The left renal
artery was carefully identified, as well as the left
ureter prior to additional dissection. The tissues overlying
the abdominal aortic aneurysm were carefully dissected away
with visualization of both the infrarenal abdominal aorta and
bifurcation and branch vessels. Distal
control was facilitated utilizing vessel loops at the
left common iliac arteries.  The iliacs were too calcified for
clamping so we planned to use distal occlusion balloons.  The
RCIA was difficult to reach with the aneurysm intact.  The
infrarenal and pararenal arotic neck were dissected and both
were
soft.  The left renal artery was controlled with a silastic
loop.
We selectd the proximal clamp location above both renals, below
the SMA to allow the proximal anastamosis right at the base of
the left renal artery.  Prior to heparinization iliac tunnels
were created. Heparin was then administered and re-dosed as
necessary to keep ACTs>280.

A bifurcated Dacron 18x9 graft was then chosen and prepped.
Following this, a longitudinal arteriotomy was performed along
the length of the aneurysm sac with removal of the
intra-aneurysmal contents. Following this removal there was no
significant bleeding evident from lumbar vessels. Iliac
backbleeding with #7 [**Doctor Last Name 18096**] balloons. Attention
was immediately turned to performance of the proximal
anastomosis. This was completed in a running fashion
utilizing 3-0 Prolene suture in a circumferential manner.
Upon completion of the proximal anastomosis, the distal
portion of the graft was grasped with subsequent removal of
the suprarenal clamp restoring flow to the renal vessels. The
graft was then adequately flushed with subsequent clamping at
each of the graft bifurcations. The proximal anastomosis was
hemostatic upon careful examination.  Urine output was slow to
resume so IV Manitol was given.  Urine output resumed
approximately 1/2 hour after removal of the proximal clamp.
