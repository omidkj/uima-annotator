History of Present Illness:
80 yo female with h/o severe COPD (on home O2), diastolic CHF
who presented to ED this AM with severe dyspnea and hypoxia.
She is currently on BiPap therefore history is somewhat limited.
She reports having cough, maybe a fever but didn't check her
temp at home.  She states her breathing has gotten worse over
the last few days to about a week or so.  She also reports
having some mild lower extremity edema.  She has been having
some chest tightness as well.  She denies any other symptoms.
She has been taking her nebs, but otherwise feels she was
getting worse.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 98.4 P 113 BP 138/46 R O2 sat.
Patient was given CTX and azithromycin in the ER for ? PNA on
CXR.  Her initial O2 sat was unable to be read in triage, then
in the room, was in the low 80s, and improved to 92% on NRB.
Given that she had barely any air movement, she was started on
BiPAP.  After about 25 mins of BiPAP, her ABG was 7.27/102/72.
Her FiO2 was decreased to 35% because she was having apneic
episodes, and with that, her repeat ABG was 7.34/79/57. She was
also given steroids and nebs in the ER, then admitted to the
MICU for further management.
.
On the floor, she reports feeling dyspneic, but slightly better.

CXR
[**2167-5-18**]
In comparison with the study of [**5-17**], there is some increasing
opacification at the left base consistent with atelectasis or
supervening
pneumonia. Hyperexpansion of the lungs is again suggestive of
chronic
pulmonary disease. Small bilateral pleural effusions are again
seen.

[**2167-5-17**]
Within that limitation, there is suggestion of a left basilar
opacity. Small
bilateral pleural effusions are new compared to [**2167-4-15**].
Calcified granulomas
in bilateral lungs are unchanged. The lungs are hyperinflated,
as before. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette, hilar contours, and pulmonary
vasculature are
not significantly changed. Osseous structures are grossly
unchanged including
the old right clavicular fracture and loss of height in mid
thoracic vertebral
body.

IMPRESSION: Limited study as above. Left basilar opacity
suggested
which may represent atelectasis versus pneumonia. There are
small bilateral
pleural effusions, new since [**2167-4-15**]. If feasible, consider PA
and lateral
views in the radiology suite for more sensitive evaluation.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 80 yo female with severe COPD, diastolic HF, who
presents with hypoxia and hypercarbia

# Hypoxia/Hypercarbia: COPD exacurbation. Possible causes of
worsening COPD include PNA, URI. Also anxiety plays a big role
in her exacurbations. We treated her with nebs, CTX and
Azithromycin. Also she was given stress dose solumedrol and
transition to prednisone po with 15 day [**Doctor Last Name 2949**]. Ativan was given
every 8 hrs as needed.  Initially she was placed on BiPAP but
was able to be weaned from this device. She is a baseline CO2
retainer and her oxygenation goal should be Sat 88-92%. Sputum
and blood cultures were sent and were ngtd on discharge. The
patient is DNR/DNI.

# Diastolic HF: No evidence of CHF exacurbation on this
admissin. We continued home dose lasix.

# DM2: not on home medications; fingersticks here markedly
elevated in the setting of steroid use. We placed her on insulin
sliding scale which should be continued until steroid [**Last Name (un) 10128**] is
completed.

# Depression/Anxiety: continued home meds
