Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital 882**] Hospital for Respiratory Distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
(History obtained from chart)
69 year old male with CHF (EF 20%), COPD, HTN, who presented to
[**Hospital 882**] Hospital ED today via EMS with shortness of breath.  He
was noted to be diaphoretic, with a BP of 180/110.  He was given
Lasix 100mg IV, NTG x 6, CPAP en route.  Upon arrival to the ED,
he was reportedly agitated and hypoxic (no O2sat recorded).  An
ABG done immediately after intubation was 7.23/86/87.  He was
transiently in atrial fibrillation with RVR to 160s with LBBB.
He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED because there were no ICU
beds at [**Hospital 882**] Hospital.  Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS
were HR 68, BP 143/70, O2sat 100% (FiO2 100%).  Telemetry showed
NSR.  He was admitted to the CCU for further management.

Currently, he is intubated and sedated, and unable to answer
questions or follow commands.  Recent medical history notable
for admission to [**Hospital1 1516**] [**Date range (1) 8769**] for CHF exacerbation suspected
[**12-19**] medication nonadherence.  He was ruled out for an acute MI
and was diuresed with IV Lasix.  He was also diagnosed with RLE
cellulitis and was treated with Augmentin (regimen completed
today).

STUDIES:

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2112-3-30**] demonstrated:
The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2). There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with borderline normal free wall function. The ascending aorta
is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

CARDIAC CATH performed in [**2112-2-25**] demonstrated:
1- Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
showed single vessel CAD. The LMCA, LAD, and RCA were free from
obstructive disease. The LCX had 70% distally and the OM branch
had 90% at mid vessel.
2- Limited resting hemodynamic assessment revealed normal
systemic
arterial pressure (119/62 mmHg) and moderate pulmonary
hypertension
(59/31/43 mmHg). The right and left-sided filling pressures were

markedly elevated with PCWP 31 mmHg and RVEDP 16 mmHg. The
cardiac
output and cardiac index were preserved at 5.0 l/min and 2.3
l/min/m2.

[**2112-4-5**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. ET tube and OG tube in standard positions.
2. Mild CHF with worsening left retrocardiac opacity, likely
combination of small left pleural effusion and left basilar
atelectasis.

[**2112-4-5**] ECG:
Sinus rhythm
Left atrial abnormality
Nonspecific T wave abnormalities
Q-Tc interval appears prolonged but is difficult to measure
Clinical correlation is suggested
Since previous tracing of [**2112-3-30**], left bundle branch block
absent

[**2112-4-8**] ECG:
Sinus bradycardia. Q-T interval prolongation. Anterior T wave
inversions
extend all the way to the lateral leads which may be due to
myocardial
ischemia. Compared to tracing #1 the T waves are completely
inverted
now from anteriorly to laterally.




Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 69 year old male with history of Chronic Systolic
Heart failure, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease,
Hypertension, who transferred from [**Hospital 882**] Hospital with
respiratory failure.
.
# Respiratory failure/Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure:
Patient arrived from [**Hospital 882**] hospital intubated for respiratory
distress.  Initial exam and CXR consistent with congestive heart
failure.  Patient was treated with IV Lasix with good effect.
He was extubated successfully and was transitioned back to Lasix
PO.  While in the hospital he overdiuresed on his home Lasix
regimen, so it was decreased from 120mg [**Hospital1 **] to 80mg daily.  Mr.
[**Known lastname **] reports missing doses of medications from time to time
and it is unclear how compliant he is at home.  He was also very
uneducated about the concept of a low sodium diet stating "I did
not know that cheese had salt in it, next time I go to
McDonald's I will ask for a hamburger without cheese."
Nutrition was consulted and he was educated on Low Sodium diet
and that he should not be eating hamburgers and other salty
foods.  Home VNA was ordered to evaluate the patients home
