HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 724**] is an 82 year-old Asian
male with a history of dementia, who was transferred from the
MICU to the floor following a long stay for respiratory failure,
complicated by fevers and complicated by bilateral iatrogenic
pneumothoraces requiring chest tube placement. Briefly the
patient was admitted on [**2196-9-26**] following a respiratory and
cardiac arrest after choking on food.  The patient was
resuscitated and intubated in the field by EMS. Estimated total
time of arrest (cardiac and respiratory) was 5 to 15 minutes
including 5 to 10 minutes of CPR.  In the Emergency Department
the patient received a left pneumothorax following an attempted
left subclavian line placement. This left pneumothorax required a
chest tube.  The Emergency Department course is also notable for
hypotension requiring Levophed, as well as witnessed aspiration
event.  Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] complications of the left chest
tube resulted in a left tented pneumothorax as well as a right
sided pneumothorax presumed secondary to high PIPs in the 90s.
The cardiac surgery was consulted and bilateral chest tubes were
placed.  The patient was initially begun on Levofloxacin/Flagyl
for presumed aspiration pneumonia with bilateral infiltrates on
chest x-ray.  The patient intermittently spiked fevers in the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for which Vancomycin was added on [**2196-9-30**].  In addition,
the patient had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia, which
was responsive to Adenosine and vagal maneuvers.  A neurology
consult was obtained who felt that anoxic brain injury was highly
unlikely and his prognosis for recovery was poor.  After an
extensive discussion with the patient's family the patient's code
status was changed to DNR/DNI.  On [**2197-10-5**] the patient was
extubated and bilateral chest tubes were discontinued. Since
[**2197-10-5**] the patient remained hemodynamically stable and the
patient was transferred to the floor on [**2196-10-6**].

care proxy.  The patient's daughter [**Name (NI) **] is power of attorney.
The patient's wife is living in she lives at home in [**Location (un) 86**].  The
patient has five children, four of whom who live locally and one
who is in route to the hospital.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER:  Temperature 97.3.
Temperature max 99.6.  Heart rate 57.  Blood pressure 95 to
130/35 to 60.  Respiratory rate 12 to 14.  O2 saturation
100%. In general, the patient is unresponsive to verbal
stimuli, but responsive to pain.  Coarse upper airway sounds
are audible.  Cardiovascular distal heart sounds without
murmurs. Lungs very coarse breath sounds, positive upper
airway noise, positive rhonchi.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended.  No masses, bowel sounds are positive.
Extremities bilateral upper extremities and bilateral lower
extremities with marked edema.

LABORATORY DATA ON [**2196-10-5**]:  White blood cell count 10.4,
hematocrit 28.3, sodium 141, potassium 4, chloride 106,
bicarb 27, BUN 22, creatinine 0.5, albumin 2.3, calcium 7.6,
magnesium 1.9.

RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray on [**10-6**] bilateral basilar lower lobe
opacities right greater then left increasing over the past
few days.

MICROBIOLOGY:  [**10-1**] blood cultures times two, sputum is
negative.  Urine is negative.  [**9-29**] blood cultures times two
are negative.  Urine is with positive coag negative staph.

Electrocardiogram on [**9-26**] normal sinus rhythm at 94 beats
per minute, right bundle branch block, low limb voltage.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is an 82 year-old Asian male with
baseline dementia who is initially admitted after a prolonged
cardiac/respiratory arrest.  He was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit with anoxic brain injury secondary to
prolonged cardiac and respiratory arrest.  In addition his
hospital course was complicated by pneumothoraces as well as
continued aspiration.  A neurology consult was obtained to
evaluate the patient and their overall consensus was that this
patient's prognosis was very poor.  Upon transfer to the floor
the patient was currently aspirating with worsening bilateral
lower lobe infiltrates, and the risk of recurrent arrest or
decompensation was high.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Pulmonary:  The patient continued
aspirating.  He remained on high oxygen flow by shovel mask. The
was continued with supplemental oxygen with suctioning prn.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient is hemodynamically stable,
blood pressure in the 90 to 120 range.

3.  Infectious disease:  Afebrile times 48 hours with negative
culture workup thus far.  His fevers are likely secondary to
aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia versus central in origin.
Because of worsening infiltrates the patient was continued on
aspiration coverage with Levofloxacin/Flagyl.

4.  Renal:  The patient's BUN to creatinine ratio was steadily
increasing.  This increasing ratio is likely indicated of a
prerenal insufficiency.  Intravenous fluids were given to the
patient to assist with the prerenal condition.

5.  Neurology:  As per the neurological evaluation significant
neurological recovery was very unlikely and the and patient's
prognosis was poor.

6.  FEN:  The patient's tube feeds were continued initially.

7.  Prophylaxis:  The patient was kept on a PPI and
subcutaneous heparin.

8.  Code status:  A family meeting was carried out with the
[**Hospital 228**] health care proxy, son [**Name (NI) **] and power of attorney
daughter [**Name (NI) **].  The [**Hospital 228**] medical condition was discussed
and at the patient's current state he was at extremely high risk
of decompensation and another cardiopulmonary arrest.  The
patient on transfer to the floor was DNR/DNI.  A family meeting
on [**2196-10-7**] with the son [**Name (NI) **] and daughter [**Name (NI) **] to represent the
family.  The [**Hospital 228**] medical condition and treatment were
discussed in depth regarding DNR/DNI, intravenous fluids,
antibiotics, deep oropharyngeal suction, laboratory draws, chest
x-rays and blood cultures.  [**Doctor Last Name **] stated that the family had
already made peace with their father's health condition and he
voiced the preference that the patient be kept comfortable.  [**Doctor Last Name **]
also stated that he wished that his father would "go peacefully"
with no intervention.  [**Doctor Last Name **] and [**Location (un) **] stated that they did
not want any intravenous fluids or any pressors.  It was decided
by the family to discontinue all lines, intravenous fluids, with
prn morphine given for comfort.  In addition, the family declined
deep oropharyngeal suctioning and laboratory draws.  Regarding
feedings, daughter felt that the nasogastric tube feedings "would
not change anything" and they opted to have the nasogastric tube
feeds discontinued as well.  The patient's family stressed that
the primary role is that the patient is to be kept comfortable
and peaceful.  A plan was made that the patient would be kept on
supplemental oxygen for comfort, given prn morphine, oral
suctioning as needed for comfort, as well as Scopolamine patches
to decrease secretions.

From [**10-8**] through [**2196-10-12**] the patient was kept comfortable with
oxygen, morphine and prn Tylenol.  Throughout his course the
patient remained unresponsive, though the patient did once open
his eyes to touch.  The patient's course continued to decline
from [**10-7**] through [**10-12**] and he was without spontaneous movement.
On [**10-10**] the patient began having increased secretions, increased
gurgling and his respiratory status became
