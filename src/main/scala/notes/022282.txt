Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Plavix

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2880**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 42104**] is an 89 year old female with history of 3VD (99%
LAD, 90% LCx, 100% RCA), NSTEMI [**9-11**], CHF with EF 20%, 3+ MR,
who has refused CABG and caths repeatedly in the past, who
presents with rising BUN/creatinine over the past 3-4 days
(baseline 1.2, now up to 2.4), and slowly worsening shortness of
breath.  Given her creatinine increase her zaroxylyn and lasix
were held for the 3 days prior to admission, with a resultant
increase in weight by 3 pounds.  She denies CP, palpitations,
PND, and no increase in her baseline orthopnea, but mild
increase in LE edema.  No dietary indiscretion, no fever, cough,
or recent illness.

On the day of admission, the patient was noted to have RR 30
with O2 sat on RA of 68% with mildly decreased mentation.  EMS
was called and 40 mg IV lasix and nitro patch were administered.
 Patient was placed on NRB and brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

In the ED, and EKG revealed lateral ST depressions, creatinine
1.6. She was given albuterol/atrovent NEBS and placed on BiPap,
with 800 cc UOP after 40 mg more of IV lasix given (total 80
mg).  CXR revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates consistent
with decompensated CHF.  She ws also given ASA, started on a
nitro drip and given IV morphine x 2 with symptomatic
improvement, though she continued to require BiPap.  Also given
solumedrol and levaquin for WBC 17.9.

Past Medical History:
1. CAD: 3VD, cath [**2128**] with 99% LAD, 90% LCx, 100% RCA stenoses.
 Refused CABG.  NSTEMI [**9-11**], hospitalization complicated by
cardiogenic shock requiring pressors and intubation and NSVT.
2. Ischemic cardiomyopathy:  TTE-[**9-11**] EF 20 %, 3+MR, 1+TR
3. CHF: Baseline 2 pillow orthopnea, chronic intermittent LE
edema.
4. DM type II
4. HTN
5. Hyperlipidemia

Social History:
Ms. [**Known lastname 42104**] moved to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab a few months ago, and enjoys it
there.  She lost her husband almost 30 years ago, and has 2
sons.  She denies any history of smoking or alcohol use.  No
IVDU.

Family History:
non-contributory

Pertinent Results:
EKG:
Sinus rhythm
Long QTc interval
Q's in the inferior leads consider old inferior infarct
Poor R wave progression consider probable anteroseptal infarct -
age
undetermined
Lateral ST-T changes may be due to myocardial ischemia
Lateral ST-T wave changes less pronounced than previous

CXR [**3-10**]:
The diffuse perivascular haze greater on the right than on the
left has regressed since the most recent study but has not
completely disappeared, indicating improved congestive heart
failure. Once again, there is cardiac enlargement in a
configuration consistent with a left atrial enlargement. There
are mural calcifications of the thoracic aorta. Osseous
structures are unremarkable.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 42104**] is an 89 y.o. female with history of three vessel
disease (99% LAD, 90% LCx, 100% RCA), NSTEMI 8.04, CHF with EF
20%, 3+ MR, who has repeatedly refused CABG/cath, admitted for
respiratory failure in setting of rising BUN/creatinine
(baseline 1.2).  Pt's lasix had been held for last week or so
secondary to low blood pressures.  On [**3-3**], BUN/creatinine was
103/1.6.  She presents with CHF exacerbation.

1. CHF exacerbation:  Resolved with diuresis and BIPAP support,
as CXR with marked improvement, diuresed to -2.5 L since
admission, O2 requirement decreased to room air.  Pt did flash
again on [**3-10**] AM, thought d/t ischemia with a CK peak of 216.
Pt improved to baseline after an hour of BIPAP and with IV
Lasix.  Pt was discharged on carvedilol and Lasix.  An ACE
inhibitor was held due to hypotension and history of acute renal
failure while on an ACE I.  Zaroxylyn was stopped because pt
responds to Lasix alone.  Pt will need daily weights and lung
exams with diuresis as needed.

2. CAD: Pt has three vessel disease, as noted above.  Continue
ASA, simvastatin, carvedilol, and ticlopidine, which was added
on this admission.  Pt has an allergy to Plavix.  Pt likely had
NSTEMI on [**3-10**] AM owing to flash pulmonary edema.  She was
placed on IV heparin for two days and her cardiac enzymes
trended down.  Pt refused cath and was managed medically with
aforementioned drugs.

3. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Patient has chronic renal
insufficiency with reported baseline creatinine of 1.2, but
seems to have been between 1.3 and 1.8 on past admissions.
Acute renal failure thought related to impaired forward flow in
setting of CHF exacerbation.  After diuresis and correction of
CHF exacerbation, pt's creatinine on discharge was 1.3.

4. Leukocytosis:  WBC elevated on admission but down to 6.8 on
discharge.  There was a concern for infection, possibly
superimposed PNA to explain subacute respiratory decompensation
2 days prior to admission.  Pt remained afebrile in hospital.
Renally dosed levofloxacin was started on [**2132-3-7**] for a 10
day course.

5. Decreased hct: Initial value of 39 likely spurious, as
outlier - on past admissions, seems to range from 30-32.
Discharged with Hct of 30.

6. DM: Pt's AM blood glucoses were in the low 100's.

7. PPx: lansoprazole.

8. Dispo: Pt to return to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.

FULL CODE: discussed with pt and her son, who is her health care
proxy.
