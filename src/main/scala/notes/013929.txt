[**2141-12-24**] 04:34PM BLOOD Lactate-1.1
.
Right upper extremity venous ultrasound [**12-24**]: No evidence for
deep vein thrombosis in the right upper extremity.

CXR [**12-28**]: A single semiupright view is compared to previous
examination of [**2141-12-26**]. There is new right basilar
atelectasis. The heart size remains stable. The small focus of
consolidation in the left mid lung has resolved. There is also
better aeration of the left lung base. There is no evidence of
pulmonary edema. Again, note is made of tracheostomy tube and
left subclavian PICC line with the tip in proximal SVC.

.
CXR [**12-24**]:There is a faint airspace opacity in the right middle
lung zone, which is new in comparison to prior study, and may
represent aspiration or pneumonia. There is bibasilar
atelectasis, and small bilateral pleural effusions, greater on
the left. No pneumothorax is seen. A left- sided PICC line is
seen, with the tip in the upper SVC. A tracheostomy tube is seen
with the tip approximately 4 cm above the carina. The pulmonary
vasculature is stable in appearance. Degenerative changes are
seen within the mid thoracic spine. The mediastinal and cardiac
contours are stable in appearance.

IMPRESSION: Faint new airspace opacity within the right mid lung
zone. As this is a new finding in a short time period, this is
concerning for aspiration, though pneumonia should also be
considered. Again seen are small bilateral pleural effusions.
.
head CT [**12-24**]:CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: No new intracranial
hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures,
or mass effect is identified. A small amount of hyperattenuating
fluid consistent with hemorrhage is layering within the
occipital horns of the lateral ventricles bilaterally, unchanged
from the previous exam. Bilateral frontal areas of
hypoattenuation as well as within the splenium of the corpus
callosum consistent with diffuse axonal injury and/or contusions
are unchanged. Partial opacification of the left maxillary,
sphenoid, ethmoid, and frontal air cells is again identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or edema.
2. Intraventricular hemorrhage again identified within the
dependent portions of the lateral ventricles bilaterally,
unchanged from the previous exam.
3. Changes from diffuse axonal injury/parenchymal contusions
again seen.
.
Left lower extremity venous ultrasound [**12-24**]: No evidence of
left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Upon admission Mr. [**Known lastname 62280**] was started on Ceftaz, Vanco, and
Flagyl for a possible aspiration PNA. Admission CXR showed RML
infiltrate. He had been on levofloxacin since discharge on [**12-22**]
for continued treatment of pansensitive E. Coli bacteremia and
E. Coli and Enterobacter positive sputum, which was d/c'ed on
arrival to the floor. Overnight he required frequent suctioning
of thick mucous and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer
monitoring.

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], Mr. [**Known lastname 62280**] continued to be tachycardic and have
copious secretions. He was continued on ceftazidime and
vancomycin. Flagyl d/c'ed on [**12-26**]. In efforts to determine the
etiology of his tachycardia (up to 120s), RUE, RLE and LLE U/Ss
were done, which showed no evidence of thrombosis (despite pt's
recent h/o RUE superficial vein thrombosis). PIV was attempted,
but despite several attempts, could not be placed and, thus, CTA
to r/o PE could not be done. Since no DVTs were appreciated,
coumadin was d/c'ed.

A morphine trial was done [**12-27**], which resulted in no slowing of
HR. His HR responded moderately to IVF, but remained somewhat
tachycardic. A similar protocol was carried out on [**12-28**], with
HR to 130s, not responding to morphine or lopressor, but did
decrease to 90s after 500mL NS bolus. Metoprolol was titrated up
to 75mg tid. Tachycardia possibly [**3-8**] autonomic instability as
result of his accident, possibly with mild overlying
hypovolemia.

Due to nonspecific T-wave changes in anterior leads, was ruled
out with negative trops x 3.

Mr. [**Known lastname 62281**] FIO2 was weaned from 0.5 to 0.35 trach mask, and
nursing noted that suctioning was required only intermittently
(approximately 4 times yesterday), with less thick secretions
than at admission. His temperatures, which were initially
elevated, normalized, and he was afebrile by time of discharge.

He was sent out on a somewhat altered regimen, with
significantly increased metoprolol dose (25mg [**Hospital1 **] to 75mg tid).
Coumadin was also d/c'ed, as U/S's showed no evidence of
thrombosis. He was discharged back to [**Hospital **] hospital for
further management.
