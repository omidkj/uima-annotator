Chief Complaint:
right sided weakness, speech difficulties

s/p tpa

History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 39440**] is a 72 year old right handed man who presents
for evaluation in the setting of diagnosed left MCA stroke.

The patient's wife states that he appeared well this AM.  They
had had breakfast and he was watching TV.  Around 11am, the
patient's wife came out of the shower and asked him to look at a
scar on her back from a recent surgery.  He said it looked fine
and returned to his seat.  About a minute or two later, his wife
turned back to him and she noticed that he was responding to
her. She walked over to him and say that he was drooling out of
his left face and his voice was just slurred.  She told him she
was calling 911 and he didn't respond.  After calling 911, she
noticed that his right hand had fallen in between the couch and
table.  She picked his arm up but it was limp.  EMS arrived and
he was quickly taken to [**Hospital3 **].

On arrival to [**Hospital1 **], the patient's NIHSS was 22.  CT of the head
was notable for a dense left MCA. Troponins were negative. He
was evaluated by tele-neurology at [**Hospital1 2025**] and was deemed a
candidate for tPA, however his blood pressure was 202/92 and
infusion was delayed as 30mg of labetalol were given to bring
his blood pressure down to goal.  The tPA bolus was given at
13:33.  Due to
bed avialability issues at [**Hospital1 2025**], the patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for additional care.  tPA infusion completed on arrival to
this hospital.

The patient is currently unable to complete a thorough review of
systems. According to his daughter, he called his PCP yesterday
complaining of tightness in his throat, concerning for angina.
Otherwise, he had no recent illnesses.  At present the patient
denies headache, vision loss, chest pain.  He feels his
breathing is a bit difficult.  He has no abdominal pain.

Past Medical History:
- CAD- s/p quadruple bypass 15 years ago.  Had a catheterization
6 months ago at [**Hospital1 3278**] which demonstrated "70% occlusion" per his
family.
- Diastolic CHF- ECHO [**5-/2197**] with EF 65%
- Hypertension
- Hyperlipidemia


Social History:
Married, retired. No smoking, alcohol or drugs.


Family History:
Not available


Physical Exam:
Initial Exam:

BP 167/90 HR 76 RR 18 O2%  97% 2L
General: Awake
Head and Neck: no cranial abnormalities, no scleral icterus
noted, mmm with copious oral secretions.  No carotid bruits
appreciated.  Small hematoma on the right lower lip.
Pulmonary: Clear anteriorly
Cardiac: irregular rhythm with frequent PVCs on tele. Distand
heart sounds, no murmurs appreciated.
Abdomen: normoactive bowel sounds, non-tender
Extremities: well perfused
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.

Neurologic:
Awake, follows midline and appendicular commands but there is
some left right confusion which can be overcome with
re-prompting.  Pt is able to state his name.  Language is
non-fluent, speech is dysarthric.  Naming with phenomic errors
and neologisms (chair= fair, glove= gov).  Repetition is intact
for single syllable words (though significantly dysarthric), but
there are dropped articles and/or syllables for longer
phrases/words.  He is right handed, but he was able to write the
words "I think" this his left hand.

CN:
PERRL 4 to 2mm.  Visual fields. EOMI without nystagmus.  Right
face without sensation to touch, pin. Right facial droop.
Hearing
intact bilaterally. Palate elevates symmetrically.
5/5 strength in trapezii and sternocleidomastoid bilaterally.
Tongue protrudes in midline.

-Motor: Normal bulk, decreased tone on the right. No pronator
drift. Strength 5/5 with the exception of the musles of the
right
hand which where flaccid.

-Sensory: Absent sensation to pinprick and touch on the right
hemibody.

-Deep tendon reflexes: 1+ thoughout, right toe upgoing.

-Coordination: FNF intact on left, right side was slow but
accurate.

Exam at discharge: Much improved speech - near fluent but
halting and severely dysarthric.  R hand weakness but
antigravity with wrist extension and finger flexion.  Also,
numbness of RLE.

Diagnostic Studies:

EKG: Sinus rhythm with A-V conduction delay. Left atrial
abnormality. Modest intraventricular conduction delay.
Borderline prolonged/upper limits of normal QTc interval.

CXR: Mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion. Left
base opacity which may represent atelectasis although
consolidation
cannot be excluded

CT PERFUSION: There is a matched region of increased MTT and
decreased rCBV in the left frontal lobe that corresponds to the
area of infarction on non-contrast CT. No additional areas of
abnormal perfusion are identified.

HEAD CTA: This portion of the study is limited due to suboptimal
bolus
timing. There is no evidence of intracranial flow-limiting
stenosis,
occlusion, or aneurysm within limits of this study.

NECK CTA: This portion of the study is limited due to suboptimal
bolus
timing. The carotid and vertebral arteries are grossly
unremarkable.

MRI: Expected evolution of the large late acute-early subacute
infarct in the left frontal lobe, territory of the superior
division of the left MCA.
Fairly extensive region of "blooming" susceptibility artifact
involving
much of the infarcted territory, representing hemorrhagic
transformation, new since the CTA performed the preceding day.
There is no evidence of hemorrhage elsewhere. Small focus of
slow diffusion at the right frontovertex, which may be either
embolic or, possibly, ACA/MCA watershed infarction. Scattered
FLAIR-hypointensities in bihemispheric subcortical and
periventricular white matter, likely the sequelae of chronic
small vessel ischemic disease.

TTE: No PFO or ASD seen. Normal global biventricular systolic
function. Mild pulmonary hypertension


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 39440**] initially presented to OSH with right arm weakness
and speech difficulties (he was noted to be not responding
verbally at home). He was given IV tpa at OSH for L MCA stroke
and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care. His exam was noted to
improve since onset of syptoms, though post-tpa he continued to
have a nonfluent aphasia, weakness of the right lower face and
hand and right sided sensory loss. By report, he had a transient
episodes of AFib in the ambulance bringing him from [**Hospital1 1474**] to
[**Hospital1 18**], but there has been no documentation of this. Upon arrival
to [**Hospital1 18**], CTA/CTP performed and given the improvement and lack
of further clot burden on CTA, no additional intervention was
pursued. He underwent MR imaging, which showed expected
evolution of the large late acute-early subacute infarct in the
left frontal lobe, territory of the superior division of the
left MCA. There was also hemorrhagic transformation noted of his
stroke. In addition, there was a small focus of slow diffusion
at the right frontovertex, which raises the probability of an
embolic event as there are b/l infarcts.

He was initially admitted to the ICU for monitoring s/p tpa. He
was then transferrted to the floor after 24 hours. While
admitted, he underwent testing to determine the etiology of his
stroke. He was monitored on tele for cardiac arrhythmias which
was normal during this admission. He had TTE, which showed no
PFO or ASD and normal global biventricular systolic function;
there was mild pulmonary hypertension. His HbA1C was 5.6. His
cholesterol is 142, with HDL 46 and LDL 76; triglycerides are
98.

Given the hemorrhagic transformation of the stroke, Coumadin was
not started at this time. Instead, he was kept on ASA 325mg once
daily and will get rep
