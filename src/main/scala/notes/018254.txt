Patient was a direct admission to the Operating Room on
[**2178-2-11**] where she underwent aortic valve replacement.
Please see the OR report for full details.

In summary, the patient had a difficult operative course.
She had an aortic valve replacement with a #19 mosaic valve.
Her bypass time was 93 minutes with a cross clamp time of 66
minutes.  The patient showed evidence of right heart failure
following a wean from the bypass pump.  Her chest was left
open with a rubber [**Doctor Last Name **] and she was transferred from the
Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At
the time of transfer the patient's mean arterial pressure was
96.  Her CVP was 17 with a PAD of 19.  She was in a sinus
tachycardia at 130 beats per minute with Levophed at 0.4
mcg/kg per minute, milrinone at 0.75 mcg/kg per minute,
Amiodarone at 1 mg per minute, Neo-Synephrine at an
undisclosed dose, epinephrine at 0.5 mcg/kg per minute,
Vasopressin at 2.4 units per minute, and Lidocaine at 2 mcg
per minute as well as propofol at 30 mg per hour.

Upon arrival in the Intensive Care Unit the patient was
placed on a _______ infusion as well as Ativan and Fentanyl
infusions.

On postoperative day one the patient remained hemodynamically
unstable, and she returned to the Operating Room, at which
time a right ventricular assist device was placed.  Please
see the OR report for full details.

In summary, the patient had an RVAD placed, and following the
procedure she was again returned to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit, again, with an open chest.  Over the
next several days the patient remained in critical condition
in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  She remained
paralyzed and sedated with full ventilatory support.  She was
slowly weaned from her vasoactive medications.  She had flow
rates of 4 to 4.5 liters per minute with her right
ventricular assist device.  She was seen by the Renal Service
to assist in fluid removal.  Additionally, the patient was
seen by the Heart Failure Service for assist in patient care
management.

On postoperative day seven the patient returned to the
Operating Room, at which time she had her chest closed.  On
postoperative day eight the patient was brought to the
Cardiac Catheterization Lab for a diagnostic catheterization
which showed a tight right coronary artery lesion which was
stented at that time.  Please see the cath report for full
details.  Following the stenting to the RCA the patient
returned to the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  She
remained hemodynamically stable with her RVAD in place and
the paralytics were slowly weaned to off so that by
postoperative day nine all paralytics had been weaned off.
By that point the patient had also been weaned from her
epinephrine, significantly weaned from her Pitressin.  The
milrinone had been weaned down.  The Lidocaine had been
discontinued, and the Levophed was also weaned to off.

Patient did well over the next several days.  However, she
was noted to have an elevated white blood cell count.  She
was pancultured and Infectious Disease was consulted at that
time.  By [**2178-2-27**] the patient was beginning to have an
ARDS type picture by chest x-ray, and at that time she was
bronched by the Interventional Pulmonary Service.  The
bronchoscopy showed diffuse blood in the airways with
bleeding from the right upper lobe.  Following the bronch the
patient's Heparin was discontinued.  The patient remained
stable over the next several days with good right ventricular
assist device flows.  She was further weaned from her
cardioactive IV medications, and on [**2178-3-3**] she again
returned to the Operating Room, at which time her right
ventricular assist device was removed.  Please see the OR
report for full details.

Following RVAD removal the patient was again transferred to
the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At that time, she
had two new mediastinal tubes, mean arterial pressure of 92
with a CVP of 19.  She was in a sinus rhythm at 110 beats per
minute with milrinone at 0.75 mcg/kg per minute, epinephrine
at 0.5 mcg/kg per minute, Levophed at 2 mcg/kg per minute,
Vasopressin at 1.2 units per hour, Amiodarone at 0.5 mg
