IMAGING:
CXR ([**2154-3-10**]):
FINDINGS: Single semi-erect AP portable view of the chest was
obtained.
There are low lung volumes. Previously seen right PICC is no
longer
identified. There is also removal of a previously seen
nasogastric tube.
There are likely bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
right, with overlying atelectasis, there is also perihilar
vascular prominence, more so on the left than the right, raising
concern for asymmetric pulmonary edema. The cardiac silhouette
is difficult to assess due to the bibasilar opacities.
Mediastinal contours are slightly less prominent as compared to
the prior study.

CT Torso w/ Contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Multifocal pneumonia predominating the lingula, also
involving the left
upper lobe and right lower lobe, with likely reactive
prevascular
lymphadenopathy.
3. Fatty liver.
4. Stable elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.
5. Right ventral hernia containing nondilated bowel loops.
However, the
extreme anterior portion of the hernia sac is incompletely
imaged.

Brief Hospital Course:
66F with COPD (on 3L home O2), morbid obesity, dCHF p/w fever,
cough, imaging and exam consistent with multifocal PNA, admitted
to ICU with elevated O2 requirement, was treated for multifocal
PNA and an acute diastolic CHF exacerbation.
.
# Multifocal Bacterial PNA - Pt presented with several days
productive cough and fever, increased O2 requirement to 6L
(baseline 2L), exam with bilateral ronchi, CT demonstrating
bilateral pnuemonia;  most concerning aspect of presentation is
hypoxia, initially requiring bipap in ED, but improved with IV
lasix and nebs, sugggesting component of volume overload and
COPD as well. Covered broadly with
vancomycin+cefepime+levofloxacin given [**Hospital3 **], but then
narrowed to PO levofloxacin. Transferred to the floor when O2
requirement improved.
.
# Chronic dCHF - EF75%, currently appearing euvolemic on exam.
Pt was diuresed ~10L down to weight of ~316lbs. Cr bumped from
0.8 to 1.1. Bicarb 42 on discharge. Breathing comfortably 94% on
3L (her home 02).
- Will d/c pt on her home dose of Lasix 40mg PO, pt likely has
more fluid to diurese but would monitor weights, 02 requirement
and Cr closely.
.
# DMII - reports on metformin at home, although PCP records
demonstrate it was discontinued several months ago. Continued on
sliding scale humalog while in house.

# Depression: continued duloxetine
.
# GERD: Continued omep
