Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Cardiac Arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Left ventricle [**First Name3 (LF) 33362**]
2. Implanted cardiodefibrilator device (ICD) placement


History of Present Illness:
71M with hx of MI in [**2081**] medically managed, AFib on coumadin,
and IDDM2 who was headed to the gym when he felt dizzy in his
car. He got out and collapsed and was found by bystander. Denies
LOC (although family states he is a poor historian) ambulance
was called and he was found to be in monomorphic vtach with
pulse. Was shocked into polymorphic VT and got amiodarone, went
into vfib (although no strip evidence of this) and was shocked
again with return to NSR with prolonged PR and STE but was alert
and interactive. Was BIBA to our ED.
.
ED/Cath Lab Course: VS: HR 72, BP 142/84, O2 97%NRB
Per report, EKG in ED with RBBB and prolonged PR. Given ASA 325
and Plavix 600mg. Code STEMI and was transferred to cath lab,
found to have 60-70% occluded Mid LAD, total occlusion of RCA
and circumflex. No intervention taken as occlusions did not
appear to be acute. Received 4000 U of Heparin on table.
Transferred to CCU.
.
In unit, he is alert, oriented, interactive and asymptomatic. He
corroborates much of the above story. Denies chest pain, SOB,
lightheadedness, weakness, numbness, or tingling. He denies
recent illness, changes in health, prodromal syndromes, recent
syncope, pre-syncope or other symptoms of concern to him.
.
He additionally denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. S/he
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CARDIAC CATH [**2108-10-26**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrates three vessel coronary artery disease. The left
atnerior
descending contains a 60-70% lesion in the mid-vessel. The right

coronary artery is chronically occluded. The circumflex artery
is
calcified and stenosedin the second obtuse marginal to 50%. \

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
.
ECHO [**2108-10-26**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is a
left ventricular aneurysm involving the basal inferior and
posterior walls. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to extensive
inferior and posterior akinesis. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
The right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. The mitral valve leaflets do not
fully coapt secondary to posterior displacement of the papillary
muscles and consequent mitral leaflet tethering. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.
.
ECHO [**2108-10-29**]
LV systolic function appears depressed. The right ventricle is
mildy dilated with normal free wall contractility. An eccentric
jet of mld to moderate ([**1-1**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2108-10-26**],
findings are similar.
