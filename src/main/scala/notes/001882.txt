History of Present Illness:
EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:
Mr [**Known lastname 76050**] is a 52-y/o gentleman with PMHx sig for HTN, HL, CAD
(s/p CABGx4 in [**5-/2164**]), recently admitted to the floor with
unstable angina, now transferred to CCU after SVG-OM perforation
during cardiac cath.
.
Pt has been in his USOH since the CABG in [**5-/2164**] (active,
independent, chest pain free) until ~3 weeks ago, when he began
experiencing intermittent non-radiating chest
tightness/discomfort and shortness of breath on exertion,
similar to the sxs he had before CABG. Pt began to experience CP
with less and less exertion--previously able to walk [**1-18**] mile,
progressing to 1 block pta--at which point, pt presented to PCP
who referred him to the ED ([**11-12**]).Pt had no PND, orthopnea,
pedal edema at that time.
EKG showed no new ischemic changes, troponins were negative and
pt was admitted to the floor with unstable angina, intermediate
risk, TIMI score 3. Pt was started on Heparin and underwent
cardiac catheterization on [**11-13**]. A 95% occlusion was noted in
the SVG-OM graft, but the graft was perforated during stent
placement. Integrillin and Heparin were stopped (Protamine was
given) and hemostasis was achieved after transient balloon
occlusion and placement of 2 covered stents. A small posterior
pericardial effusion was noted on echo and pt c/o CP and HA
following vessel perforation/hemostasis but pt remained
hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure.
On arrival to the CCU, pt's vitals were stable and pt reported
cp resolved, though mild HA persisted.

Brief Hospital Course:
52-y/o M w HTN, HL, CAD (s/p CABGx4 in [**5-/2164**]), recently
admitted for UA now s/p OM perforation during cardiac cath.
.
PERFORATION DURING CATHETERIZATION: Pt arrived in CCU with
stable vitals and Swan numbers.  An echo on [**11-14**] showed no
tamponade.  Hematocrit was stable.  No significant events were
seen on telemetry and EKGs were unchanged.  The swan catheter
was pulled and pt ws transferred to floor.
.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: His troponin was initially positive at
.14, attributed intra-procedure placement of stents and
hemostasis.  Troponin had trended down to .09 by the following
day.  Pt never complained of chest pain or dyspnea or had any
new EKG changes.  He was continued on ASA 325mg PO daily,
clopidogrel, pravastatin, metoprolol.

Discharge Diagnosis:
S/P Coronary Artery Bypass Graft
Hyperlipidemia
Hypertension
Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction


Discharge Condition:
stable


Discharge Instructions:
You had symptoms that were caused by a blockage in one of your
bypass grafts. This graft was opened in the catheterization lab
and a drug eluting stent was placed. This will help to keep the
artery open but you will need to take aspirin and Clopodigrel
every day for at least one year. Do not miss [**First Name (Titles) 691**] [**Last Name (Titles) 4319**] or the
stent can clot off and cause another heart attack. It is very
important that your cholesterol numbers are very well
controlled. Information about a heart healthy diet was discussed
with you.
.
Please take all of your medicines as ordered. Please call Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] if you have any chest pain, nausea, trouble breathing,
unusual swelling, or a new cough.
.
You need to weigh yourself every day and call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if
you have a weight gain of more than 3 pounds in 1 day of 6
pounds in 3 days.
