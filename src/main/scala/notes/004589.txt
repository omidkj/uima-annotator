EEG

FINDINGS:
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were none.
AUTOMATED SEIZURE DETECTIONS: There were none.
AUTOMATED SPIKE DETECTIONS: There were 567. As on prior days,
many
multi-focal independent spikes, sharp waves, and spike and slow
wave
discharges were seen. These were prominent over the left
parietal and
right posterior temporal regions, although discharges in other
locations were seen as well. Some discharges appeared to be left

occipital in location as well.

ROUTINE TIME SAMPLE: Showed a slow and disorganized background
throughout the entire recording. Frequent multi-focal
independent
epileptiform discharges as described above were seen on the
routine time
sampling, at times in runs of 10 to 15 seconds at a time
repeating
at a 1 Hz frequency. However, these discharges were never
prolonged,
persistent, or frequent enough to suggest ongoing seizures,
although
they occurred throughout the entire day's recording.
SLEEP: No clear state changes were seen.

CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.

IMPRESSION: This 24-hour video EEG portable telemetry captured
no
pushbutton activations. Although no discrete seizures were
detected,
there were frequent multifocal epileptiform discharges seen in
an
ongoing fashion throughout the day's recording, sometimes in
runs
lasting 10 to 15 seconds with a 1 Hz frequency. The background
was
suggestive of a mild to moderate encephalopathy. Overall, this
recording appears essentially unchanged from the prior day's.
