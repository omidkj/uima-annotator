Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Haldol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
Reason for admission: Chest pain
Reason for transfer to the MICU: hypercarbic respiratory failure



Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation.
Arterial line placement.

History of Present Illness:
87 y/o woman with CAD, Afib, presents with shortness of breath
and chest pain since morning of admission. She felt that her
shortness of breath has improved since getting to the hospital.
She can't elaborate as to what the extent of her activity level
is, but she cannot walk up one flight of stairs. She denied any
orthopnea or PND. On the morning of admission she was doing
regular housework, when she developed substernal pressure, as if
someone was sitting on her chest. She took one SL nitro and
called her friend to take her to the [**Name (NI) **]. On interview, she
denies any CP. She also c/o of having visual hallucinations at
night, she thinks it prob in her dreams.
.
On review of systems, the patient denied any chest pain,
shortness of breath, fevers, chills, weight loss, night sweats,
fatigue, headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, sore throat,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, any new rashes, denies
dysuria, hematuria, increased urgency, diarrhea, constipation,
hematochezia, melena, epistaxis. All other systems were reviewed
in detail and were negative except for what has been mentioned
above.
.
In the ED, VS T 98.2 HR 80 BP 147/73 Sat 94 on RA increased to
98 on 3:. ECG with subtle ST dep/TW flattening anterior leads.
She was given ASA 325mg, combivent neb, plavix 600mg and lasic
40mg iv times 1. CXR showed vascular congestion. She had a foley
placed.
.
On the floor, patient was agitated requiring large amounts of
zyprexa and also Haldol was used. 1 Am [**6-12**] patient was found
unresponsive. ABG was performed with PH 7.15 pCO2 112 pO2 105.
Pt was electively intubated. Moving all four extremities,
responding to sternal rub. Suction of brown material, question
of aspiration. Pt to CT scan to assess for bleed, CVA and then
to MICU for further work up and management.

6. Anxiety.
7. Osteoarthritis.
8. Carpal tunnel syndrome.
9. Sciatica.
10. Status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy.
11. Status post lumpectomy


Social History:
Negative tobacco, occasional alcohol. Lives alone. Has two sons
and five grandchildren. Patient was born in Poland, Now lives
alone in [**Location (un) 583**] with daily care taker visits and [**1-23**]
times/week VNA.

Family History:
Father with heart problems.

Physical Exam:
On admission to MICU
VS: 95/57. 62, 99.1, 100% on AC 450, 18/5 100 fio2
Gen: intubated, agitated, moving all extremities.
HEENT: Pupils pinpoint, ET tube in place.
CV: irregularly irregular
Lung:course breath sounds bilaterall, no wheezes noted.
Abdomen: Distended, hypoactive bowel sounds, but soft.
Ext: 1+ peripheral edema bilaterally, no clubbing, cyanosis, no
calf pain, DP pulses are 2+ bilaterally
Neuro: moving all extremities, unable to follow commands. DTR 2+
throughout, Toes downgoing
Skin: pink, warm, no rashes


Pertinent Results:
Echocardiography: EF 45% The left atrium is elongated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis. The right
ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. No aortic stenosis is suggested. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-22**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2158-9-28**],
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower.
The severity of mitral regurgitation is slightly increased. Left
ventricular systolic function is similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 87 y/o woman with CAD, atrial fibrillation, Asthma,
who presented with acute onset of substernal chest pain and
altered mental status.  On [**6-12**] the floor she was found to be in
respiratory distress and found to be in hypercarbic respiratory
failure; this prompted emergent intubation and transfer to MICU.
 The patient was noted to be frequently agitated as well.  A
psychiatry consult was called and believed she had [**Last Name (un) **] body
dementia--notably the patient had received large dose.
The patient's hypercarbia resolved and the patient was extubated
on [**6-14**].  She was maintained on albuterol and atrovent
nebulizers.  Post extubation the patient was markedly less
agitated and her respiratory status remained stable.   She
passed a speech and swallow evaluation [**6-16**] and was subsequently
discharged.
.
In summary, this is an 87 year old woman with atrial
fibrillation, coronary artery disease and newly diagnosed with
[**Last Name (un) 309**] body dementia that was likely exacerbated by use of
antipsychotic medication.  This in turn may have led to
oversedation, hypoventilation and subsequent hypercarbic
respiratory failure.  She has been extubated for 48 h with nl
respiratory status and now appears again at her baseline mental
status.

Issues:
1) Reactive airway disease/respiratory failure, asthma vs. COPD
vs. sedative related hypoventilation.
-continue albuterol, atrovent nebulizers
-should get pulmonology followup with PFT's
-question component of aspiration, continue broad spectrum
antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn) for two more days against
presumed hospital acquired pneumonia.
.
2) [**Last Name (un) 309**] Body dementia
-needs psychiatry and possibly neurology follow up
-avoid all antipsychotics
.
3) Atrial fibrillation, rate controlled without medications
-was on digoxin, but was bradycardic, would not continue digoxin
-continue coumadin, INR therapeutic.
.
4) CAD/chest pain
-continue aspirin.
-ruled out for MI
.
5) CHF, EF 40-45%
-held diuretics for low nl blood pressures
-diuresed cautiously, can restart PO lasix
.
6) Hyperglycemia, likely steroid related
-insulin sliding scale (humalog)
-consider A1c
.

evaluation cleared.
