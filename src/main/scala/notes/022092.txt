History of Present Illness:
64 y.o. man with hairy cell leukemia x 10 years, protate CA,
non-small cell lung Ca in RUL presenting from [**Hospital3 **] for
hemoptysis. Pt was admitted there on [**12-28**] for febrile
neutropenia. On day of admission, pt noted himself to be febrile
to 101 and he had been having increased productive cough with
some blood tinged sputum. He also had some DOE, 8 pound wt loss
over 2 weeks. Pt was maintained on levaquin which he was already
on for salmonella prophylaxis. CXR showed increased opacity of
RUL c/w PNA. Pt was treated with levaquin.
.
On [**12-30**], he developed hemoptysis. He was taken to the OR,
intubated on [**12-31**]. A bronchosopy was performed which showed a
large clot at the carina and some minor oozing but no active
bleeding. The patient maintained good oxygenation and
ventilation on the ventilator. A pre-bronch Hct was 26.1 (from
28 on admit) and went to 24.3 post-bronch and 21.2 this morning.
He received 1 U PRBC and 2 U FFP for INR of 1.4.
.
Patient was admitted on [**12-28**]

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course:
64 y.o. man with hairy cell leukemia x 10 years, protate CA,
non-small cell lung Ca in RUL presenting from [**Hospital3 **] for
hemoptysis.  He was admitted to OSH on [**12-28**] with fever and
borderline neutropenia; he was started on levofloxacin for ? RUL
PNA. He developed massive hemoptysis and was transferred here
intubated. He remained febrile and neutropenic. He has undergone
two major IR procedures to stop the bleeding from his RUL which
is full of tumor.  There are no further interventions that IR
can do if he bleeds more.  Thoracics has seen him in case he
bleeds more an needs emegency surgery.
.
On day of admission to the OSH, pt noted himself to be febrile
to 101 and he had been having increased productive cough with
some blood tinged sputum. He also had some DOE, 8 pound wt loss
over 2 weeks PTA.  Pt was maintained on levaquin which he was
already on for salmonella prophylaxis.  CXR showed increased
opacity of RUL c/w PNA.
.
On [**12-30**], he developed hemoptysis. He was taken to the OR,
intubated on [**12-31**]. A bronchosopy was performed which showed a
large clot at the carina and some minor oozing but no active
bleeding. The patient maintained good oxygenation and
ventilation on the ventilator. A pre-bronch Hct was 26.1 (from
28 on admit) and went to 24.3 post-bronch and 21.2 thereafter.
He received 1 U PRBC and 2 U FFP for INR of 1.4.
.
In terms of his NSCLC treatment, he has undergone three cycles
of Taxol/Carboplatin, completed ~4 weeks PTA. Treatment was
halted [**1-11**] pancytopenia. Has also been receiving radiation
treatment with last treatment [**2113-12-28**]. Has received about 24
treatments (5 treatments/wk x 5 weeks). Has been taking Procrit
for chronic anemia, and received 1U PRBC on [**2113-12-22**]. Also on
daily SC neupogen, started in-house.
.
The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for the specific
interventional radiology and pulmonology procedures unique to
the institution.  Multiple attempts to control the bleeding via
selective embolization were undertaken, and tenuous hemostasis
was acheived.  The patient, who had been intubated for airway
protection, was extubated without incident and suffered no
respiratory failure.  He had arrived with fever and neutropenia
from the OSH, and vanco/caspo/cefepime broad coverage was
initiated.  Multiple cultures were drawn given the persistent
fever, and all were negative in the final read.  Although the
patient was stabilized via multiple bronchoscopies and
interventional radiologic procedures, rebleeding remains a
significant risk, and little could be done if another
catastrophic bleed were to develop.
.
His persisent neutropenia was unexpected so far out from his
last dose of chemotherapy.  However, with persistent Neupogen
dosing the patient's ANC and total leukocyte counts gradually
increased into a non-neutropenic state.  He was continued on
vanc/cefepime/caspo until ANC > 1000, then all were discontinued
since the patient had remained afebrile for > 48 hours and had
persistently negative culture data.
.
At the time of discharge, the patient was with stable
hematocrit, adequate pain control, stable O2 requirement,
improving functional mobility, and good mental status.  The
family would like to transition care to Hospice, likely at a
long-term institution as this patient would be very difficult to
care for at home.
.
Plan:
.
#. Hemoptysis: Recently extubated, with stable Hct and no
visible hemoptysis.  IR options have been exhausted.  CT surgery
has evaluated patient and would only take back to the OR if
massive bleeding recurs.  IP and IR have exhausted all options.
Patient will likely suffer recurrent bleeding and hemoptysis
despite our best efforts.
-- QD Hct.  Would likely be very obvious if rebleeds.
Transfused 1u PRBC [**1-15**].
-- End of life issues currently being addressed with family, SW
involved, palliative care involved.
-- Patient recently extubated.  Follow pulmonary exam and VS for
signs of decompensation.  Continue inhalers.  Nebs available
PRN.
-- Respiratory status stable, slightly improved over last
several days.
-- Hct slow decrease over past week, may be [**1-11**] decreased
production.  1u PRBC transfused on [**1-15**].  No signs of active
bleeding.  Hemolysis labs negative.
.
#. Fever/Neutropenia: Cause of neutropenia remains obscure,
definitely a component of chemo-induced neutropenia, but also a
possible component of HCL relapse.  Filgr
