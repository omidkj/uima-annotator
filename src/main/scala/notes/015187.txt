History of Present Illness:
58 yo M with history of CML treated with allogeneic stem cell
transplant in [**2121**] and complicating graft versus host disease
presents from rehab following an episode of hypoxia to the 70s
earlier today. Patient was discharged from the ICU to the high
level rehab facility on [**2124-10-11**]. Patient notes that he was
doing all prescribed pulmonary hygiene, including inexsufflator
and was at his baseline until early on day of admission when he
felt acutely dyspneic and was noted to have an oxygen saturation
in the 70s. (ED resident originally reported that patient's
[**Year (4 digits) 30712**] was measured on room air; however, patient cannot
corraborate this information. Patient was discharged with
instructions to remain on 4L supplemental oxygen at all times.)

Upon presentation to the ED: T 100.1, HR 76, BP 114/74, RR 22,
O2Sat 100% NRB. Patient was assessed as having a worsened CXR
and was given prednisone 60 mg, albuterol and ipratropium neb,
acetaminophen, Zosyn, and tobramycin. Vitals prior to transfer
to the ICU were: HR 84, BP 112/71, RR 14, O2Sat 98% NRB.

ROS:
(+)ve: productive cough, dyspnea, back pain (baseline),
abdominal pain (baseline)
(-)ve: fever, chills, sweats, constipation, diarrhea, orthopnea,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, sore throat, myalgias, coughing
with meals or drinking

Past Medical History:
1) CML s/p allogeneic stem cell transplant [**2121**] c/b GVHD
2) Chronic graft vs host disease on immunosuppressants
-has had chronic abdominal discomfort since transplant that is
thought to be associated with GVHD
-bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis obliterans related to GVHD of
the lung
3) h/o resistant pseudomonas ([**2124-6-8**]), ESBL E coli ([**2124-5-21**]),
stenotrophomonas ([**2123-12-23**]) in sputum
4) Linezolid for VRE bacteremia ([**2124-4-24**]) which he contracted
during a hospitalization for cellulitis (see d/c summary
[**2124-5-4**])
5) Chronic RUQ pain since [**2113**] (?in addition to GVH-related
pain)
- work up unrevealing
- on narcotics
6) GERD w/ Barrett's esophagus
7) Hypertension
8) h/o pulmonary embolism in [**5-8**]; DVT [**12-27**]
9) Compression fractures since the beginning of [**2122**] at T8, T9,

Studies:
=============
[**2124-10-14**]: ECG: Sinus rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2124-9-28**] there is no change
.
[**2124-10-14**]: Chest Xray: Markedly limited study as above. There has
been interval opacification of the retrocardiac left lower lung
which is presumably in part due to atelectasis and large
effusion although a concurrent pneumonia cannot be excluded.
Mild edema.
.
[**2124-10-15**]: CT Chest w/o Contrast:
1. Stable left pleural effusion with dependent consolidation.
Interval
increase in size of right pleural effusion and dependent
consolidation at the right lung base. New opacities at the right
lung in a dependent distribution, likely atelectasis, though a
component of aspiration is possible.
2. Secretions/mucus in the right mainstem bronchus.
3. Stable centrilobular emphysema and basilar bronchiectasis.
4. Multilevel compression fractures throughout the thoracic
spine, not
significantly changed compared to prior study.
5. Nonobstructibe nephrolithiasis.
.
[**2124-10-17**] Chest Xray:
Greater opacification at the base of the right lung is probably
worsening
atelectasis. Severe atelectasis in the left lower lobe and small
bilateral
pleural effusions are stable. Lungs elsewhere are grossly clear
though
pulmonary and mediastinal vascular congestion suggests volume
overload. Of
note, recent chest CT scan showed abundant bronchial secretions
which may be playing a role in the persistent atelectasis.
Moderate cardiomegaly is
stable.
.
[**2124-10-23**] TTE: IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's
body habitus. Left ventricular function is normal, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle
is not well seen. Diastolic function is probably normal. Mild
mitral and aortic regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2124-4-24**], mild aortic regurgitation is seen on the current
study. This was present on the prior study although not reported
as such, likely due to suboptimal image quality.
.
[**2124-10-25**] CXR portable AP: As compared to the previous
examination, the monitoring and support devices are in unchanged
position. The pre-existing left pleural effusio
