Chief Complaint:
Asymptomatic

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2133-4-8**] Mitral Valve Repair, PFO closure

History of Present Illness:
64 year old female who was found to have a new heart murmur on
physical exam in [**Month (only) 1096**]. An echocardiogram was performed which
revealed severe posterior leaflet mitral valve regurgitation.
She was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1655**] who performed a cardiac
catheterization which showed no significant coronary artery
disease however it confirmed severe mitral regurgitation noting
severe pulmonary hypertension. Given the severity of her mitral
valve disease, she has been referred for surgery. She presents
today for pre-admission testing prior to surgery.

Carotid Bruit- referred murmur

Pertinent Results:
[**4-8**] Echo: Pre Bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. A patent foramen ovale is present. A left-to-right
shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely
more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated and the st junction
appears partially effaced. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous.
There is partial Posterior mitral leaflet flail of P2 and
possibly part of P3 with a torn chordae seen. An eccentric,
anteriorly directed jet of Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect).
Post Bypass: Patient is in sinus rhythm on phenylepherine
infusion. There is a partial annuloplasty ring on the mitral
valve, which is also status post partial posterior leaflet
resection. There is trace/minimal mitral regurgitation. Peak
mitral gradients 4, mean 1 mm Hg. AI remains mild. TR remains
mild. PFO is now has tiny flow from left to right s/p closure.
LVEF 50-55%. Aortic contours intact. Remaining exam is
unchanged. All findings discussed with surgeons at the time of
the exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit after undergoing pre-operative
work-up as an outpatient. On [**4-8**] she was brought to the
operating room where she underwent a Mitral valve repair with a
triangular resection of the middle scallop of the posterior
leaflet/Mitral valve annuloplasty with a 28 mm Physio II ring/
Closure of PFO with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please refer to operative report
for further details.She tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CVICU for further invasive monitoring in
stable condition. Within 24 hours she was weaned from sedation,
awoke neurologically intact and extubated. Beta blockade and
aspirin were resumed. All lines and drains were discontinued in
a timely fashion. She was gently diuresed towards her
preoperative weight. She continued to progress and was
transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring on
POD#1. The physical therapy service was consulted for assistance
with her postoperative strength and mobility. On POD#2 she went
into postoperative atrial fibrillation. She was administered
Amiodarone and became bradycardic. Amiodarone was discontinued
and her home medication, Nadolol, was resumed. Her atrial
fibrillation was rate controlled and she was asymptomatic. After
24 hours of remaining in Atrial fibrillation anticoagulation was
initiated with Coumadin.  She continued to make steady progress
and was discharged home on postoperative day #4. All follow up
appoinments were advised.
