History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 59148**] is a 70 year old female admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital
for chest pain. She ruled in for a myocardial infarction by
enzymes with a troponin of 0.21. Her hospital course was
complicataed by pulmonary edema on [**2134-2-17**] for which she was
intubated. She was also found to be quite anemic requiring 6
units of blood total. Ceftriaxone was started for pneumonia. A
cardiac catheterization was significant for an 80% stenosed
right coronary artery, mild circumflex disease and questionable
left main disease. She was subsequently transferred to the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for percutaneous coronary
intervention and further management.

[**2134-2-26**] EKG
Atrial fibrillation. Left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-T wave
changs. No
previous tracing available for comparison.

[**2134-2-26**] Cardiac Catheterization
Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated significant disease in the LMCA. The short LMCA had
an
ostial and proximal 80% lesion which resulted in pressure
damping using
a 5 French catheter. The LAD had mild luminal irregularities
without
angiographically apparent, flow-limiting disease. The LCx had a
60%
lesion in the OM1 branch and mild disease in the OM2. The RCA
was not
selectively engaged but had a known 50% diffuse proximal segment
and a
focal 80% midvessel lesion.

[**2134-3-1**] Carotid duplex ultrasound
Plaque formation seen at the bilateral carotid bifurcations,
associated with a 60-69% stenosis in the right internal carotid
artery and a less than 40% stenosis in the left internal carotid
artery.

[**2134-3-1**] ECHO
Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
global
and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation.

[**2134-3-2**] CXR
Cardiomegaly

[**2134-3-4**] Successful exchange of nonfunctioning right IJ
hemodialysis catheter for a new 19-cm catheter-tip tunneled
hemodialysis catheter with tip in right atrium. Line is ready
for use.

[**2134-3-8**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Severe native three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. LIMA with 90% narrowing in the mid vessel consistent with a
kink.
3. Severely elevated right sided filling pressures.
4. Moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension.
5. Severely elevated left sided filling pressures.
6. Successful placement of drug-eluting stents in RCA

[**2134-3-11**] Head CT
Multiple foci of decreased attenuation involving both the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]
and white matter in the parietooccipital regions bilaterally,
which likely represent infarcts. Given the lack of a specific
vascular distribution and the multiplicity of these, this likely
is an embolic phenomenon. No intracranial hemorrhage.

[**2134-3-17**] PICC Placement

[**2134-3-23**] Abdomen CT scan
Extensive atheromatous disease involving the aorta as well as
the visceral arteries. Probable hepatic and splenic infarcts.
Probable colitis distal colon. Correlate clinically and with
endoscopy if indicated. Discussed with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] of referring
team. There are patchy-ground glass changes within the entire
lungs, which findings should be correlated with other parameters
of failure. Airways appear patent. Incidental small tracheal
diverticulum was seen.

[**2134-3-26**] Ultrasound
1) Normal Doppler evaluation of the portal veins, hepatic veins,
and hepatic arteries. Given these findings and the subsegmental
appearance of the hepatic infarct, an embolic etiology may be
considered.
2) Ill-defined hypoechoic region in the right lobe/dome of the
liver, corresponding to the area of suspected hepatic infarct.
3) Spleen not able to be imaged due to obscuring gas from the
coexisting pneumothorax.

[**2134-3-29**] ECHO
1. The left atrium is normal in size. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
6.There is a small posterior ( to the right atrium) pericardial
effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be
excluded.
7. There is an echogenic density in the right ventricle
consistent with a
pacer wire.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 59148**] was admitted to the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1675**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Medical
Center on [**2134-2-26**] for further management of her cardiac disease.
She underwent a cardiac catheterization which revealed left main
and 2 vessel disease. After her cardiac catheterization she
developed right lower quadrant pain. A CT scan was performed
which revealed a moderate to large retroperitoneal bleed in her
pelvis extending to the right kidney. As her vitals signs and
hematocrit were stable, careful observation was performed. The
renal staff was consulted for assistance with her end stage
renal disease necessitating hemodialysis. Hemodialysis was
resumed per her schedule. Given the severity of her coronary
disease, the cardiac surgical service was consulted for surgical
revascularization. Ms. [**Known lastname 59148**] was worked-up in the usual
preoperative manner. She was transfused for anemia. Ceftriaxone
and clindamycin were continued for pneumonia and an elevated
white blood cell count. A carotid duplex ultrasound was
performed which revealed moderate right and m
