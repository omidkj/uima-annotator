Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 371**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall down stairs

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
On [**2164-4-15**]: posterior cervical laminectomy C4-C7.
2. Posterior thoracic laminectomy T4-T5.
3. Posterior cervico-thoracic arthrodesis C3-T9.
4. Posterior cervico-thoracic instrumentation C3-T9.
5. Application of local autograft.
6. Cortical cancellous allograft.


History of Present Illness:
53-year-old male who fell down 15 steps by report while
intoxicated. He was brought to an area hospital and subsequently
transferred to the [**Hospital1 1444**] for full trauma evaluation.
On his arrival he was found to exhibit flaccid paralysis of
bilateral upper extremities, but demonstrated some sacral
sensory sparing and distal lower extremity strength 3/5 in
the gastrocnemius soleus complex, [**Last Name (un) 938**], tibialis anterior. He
underwent imaging including fine-cut CT and MRI of his entire
spine.  This identified an undisplaced fracture of the C2
pars into the body, involving the foramen transversarium
without vertebral injury as well as a C3 spinous process
fracture, evidence of previous C4 and C5 spinal process
fractures, severe subaxial spondylosis with ligamentum flavum
buckling causing severe central as well as foraminal subaxial
stenosis and a non-displaced C4 injury with increased STIR
signal. Thoracic imaging identified T3 spinous process fracture
with posterior ligamentous complex disruption, a T4 burst
fracture with retropulsion, and a minimally displaced T7
compression fracture with increased STIR signal.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2164-4-24**] 4:02 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: eval for interval changes

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
53 year old man with recent trach/PEG placement s/p multilevel
spinal fractures
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for interval changes
HISTORY: Multilevel spinal fractures, to assess for
cardiopulmonary disease.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**4-23**], there is
improvement in the diffuse bilateral pulmonary changes extending
outward from the hilum, consistent with decreasing pulmonary
venous pressure. The cardiac size remains within normal limits.
The costophrenic angles are now more sharply seen. Metallic
devices and support monitoring devices remain in place. The IVC
filter is again noted.

IMPRESSION: Improving pulmonary vascular status.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2164-4-21**] 9:16 AM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: Acute intracranial process?

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
53 year old man with hypertension breaking through
supratherapeutic doses of benzodiazepines and opioids
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Acute intracranial process?
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST.

INDICATION: 53-year-old man with hypertension, breaking-through
supratherapeutic doses of benzodiazepines and opioids. Rule out
acute intracranial process.

COMPARISON: [**2164-4-14**].

CT HEAD WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is no acute
intracranial hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline
structures, or hydrocephalus. The density values of the brain
parenchyma are within normal limits.

Since prior examination, there has been development of extensive
mucosal thickening involving the imaged maxillary sinuses, right
greater than left, as well as air-fluid levels of sphenoid sinus
and opacification of mastoid air cells. Nondisplaced right
occipital condyle flap fracture is incompletely imaged.

IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of acute hemorrhage or edema.

2. Interval development of sinus disease.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2164-4-14**] 5:08 AM

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

Reason: ? INJURY
Field of view: 36

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
53 year old man with s/p fall 15stairs +loc +etoh
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please eval for acute injury
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: 53-year-old male after fall while intoxicated with
concern for traumatic injury of the torso.

COMPARISON: No prior.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis
after Optiray IV contrast with multiplanar reformats.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart and great vessels of
the chest opacify well. There is no evidence of mediastinal
hematoma. There is no pericardial fluid. Circumferential
atherosclerotic calcification is noted throughout the aorta.
Dependent opacity is noted of both lower lobes which may simply
represent atelectasis but is concerning for aspiration. There is
no pleural fluid or pneumothorax.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: In the peripheral right
hepatic lobe is noted a 3.4 x 2.7 cm triangular-shaped area of
relative low attenuation of the hepatic parenchyma. There is a
suggestion of a tiny amount of adjacent subcapsular fluid. A
small round subcentimeter hypodense focus of the left hepatic
lobe is too small to characterize. The background hepatic
attenuation is somewhat heterogeneous suggesting underlying
chronic liver disease. There is mild gallbladder wall thickening
possibly due to liver disease, but no adjacent fluid or stones.
The spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, and
intra-abdominal large and small bowel are unremarkable.
Incidental note is made of pancreas divisum. There is no free
intraperitoneal gas or fluid. Several mildly enlarged
retroperitoneal lymph nodes are noted measuring up to 11-mm on
short axis.

Atherosclerotic calcification is noted at the origins of the
celiac, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**].

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, prostate, seminal
vesicles, and pelvic loops of bowel and bladder are
unremarkable. There is a Foley catheter within the urinary
bladder.

BONE WINDOWS: An acute wedge compression fracture is noted of T4
with retropulsion of bone causing moderate central canal
stenosis. Also noted is a minimally displaced fracture through
the spinous process of T3 which extends into the bilateral
transverse processes.

IMPRESSION:

1. Acute wedge compression fracture of T4 with retropulsion of
bone causing moderate central canal stenosis. Minimally
displaced fracture involving the transverse and spinous
processes of T3.

2. 3.4 cm hypodense region of the peripheral right hepatic lobe
with suggestion of tiny amount of adjacent subcapsular fluid is
suspicious for laceration in a patient s/p trauma. Subcentimeter
low density focus of the left hepatic lobe not fully
characterized and relation to trauma uncertain.
