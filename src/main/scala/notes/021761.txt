===================
MICROBIOLOGY:
Urine Cx negative [**2103-5-10**] and [**2103-5-11**]
===================
ECG [**2103-5-10**]:
Atrial fibrillation with a slow ventricular response.
Non-specific
intraventricular conduction delay. Non-specific ST-T wave
changes.
In the setting of the non-specific intraventricular conduction
delay
the Q-T interval is probably prolonged. Compared to the previous
tracing
the rate is slower.

IMAGING STUDIES:

CXR [**2103-5-10**]:
There has been prior median sternotomy and coronary artery
bypass
surgery. Pulmonary vascularity appears increased in caliber but
there is no evidence of acute pulmonary edema. Small-to-moderate
right pleural effusion has slightly increased in size from the
prior study, and is accompanied by adjacent right basilar
parenchymal opacity, likely atelectasis.

CT CHEST [**2103-5-10**]:
1. Increasing right pleural effusion with no evidence of
pneumothorax.

2. Increasing anterior chest wall hernia, which contains part of
the
transverse colon.

3. Unchanged sternal widening after sternotomy and CABG with no
evidence of
osteomyelitis.

4. Multiple new ground glass pulmonary nodules. Given very small
individual
and overall size, likely not of significant clinical
consequence. Correlate
clinically.

CXR [**2103-5-11**]:
Since yesterday, right pleural effusion significantly increased,
now moderate to severe, could be hemothorax given the clinical
information of
supratherapeutic INR. Right middle lobe and right lower lobe
collapse
increased. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours
are otherwise unchanged. Sternotomy wires are intact. The left
lung is essentially clear.  There are no signs of volume
overload.

CXR [**2103-5-12**]:
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improvement
with
reduction of the pre-existing right-sided pleural effusion. The
remaining
effusion is mild-to-moderate in extent. There is no evidence of
newly
occurred focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia. The
retrocardiac
lung areas, however, are less well-aerated than on the previous
film. The
size of the cardiac silhouette appears unchanged.

CXR [**2103-5-13**]:
As compared to the previous examination, the extent of the
pre-existing right pleural effusion has markedly decreased.
Although dorsal portions of the effusion might not be
visualized, the chest radiograph now displays the entire right
hemidiaphragm. Substantial portions of lateral pleural effusion
are no longer present. Unchanged cardiomegaly. Dense right
hilum. Minimal signs indicative of overhydration. Focal
parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia have not newly
occurred.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 77911**] is a 67 year old female with a history of
diastolic heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and atrial
fibrillation who presented with worsening dyspnea over the
course of one week both with exertion and at rest. She was felt
to be having an acute exacerbation of her diastolic heart
failure given clinical signs of volume overload including
increased right sided pleural effusion, crackles on lung exam,
elevated jugular venous pressure, and lower extremity edema. On
the floor she was diuresed with intravenous lasix but continued
to be hypoxic despite increasing her oxygen and even delivering
oxygen via face mask. Her course on the floor was further
complicated by epistaxis, likely related to digital trauma in
the setting of a supratherapeutic INR. She was seen by ENT who
placed absorbable packing which stopped the epistaxis. Reversal
of INR initiated with Vitamin K 2 mg PO x 1.

Patient ultimately, required transfer to the ICU given her
persistent hypoxia. She had a CXR prior to transfer that showed
increased right pleural effusion volume that was particularly
concerning given she was actually diuresing quite well. In the
MICU diuresis with lasix boluses was continued. Given
improvement in right sided pleural effusion thoracentesis was
not attempted.

Patient was called back out to the floor today, [**5-13**]. On morning
rounds she appeared closer to euvolemia and CXR confirmed that
right sided pleural effusion markedly decreased. Patient's sats
in high 90's on [**2-5**].5 L which is what she uses at baseline.
Later in am patient began to have intermittent epistaxis managed
with pressure. Per nursing hemostasis was achieved with this
manuev
