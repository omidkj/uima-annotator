Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3151**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter
Central Line Placement (R IJ)


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 51-yo woman with T1-T2 paraplegia, COPD, and
multiple recent admissions for pneumonia, who comes in from home
with hypoxia, somnolence, and cough productive of green sputum.
The pt and husband confirm that she had been feeling very well
until the morning of admission. On the morning of admission, the
husband found her to be more difficult to arouse. He checked her
oxygen saturation and found her to be 92-93% on 2L NC, but over
the next few hours continued to be somnolent and with
progressively worsening hypoxia to the low 80s on 2L NC and
still less than 90% on 4L NC, so she was brought in to the ED.
Her husband also reports that she has had increased cough today,
with green liquid/watery secretions, and feeling cold, but notes
that she was warm to touch. He found her temperature to be 99F.
She denies any chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or
wheeze.
.
On arrival to the ED, VS - Temp 101.8F, BP 144/102, HR 110, R
24, SaO2 81%. She was placed on NRB with improvement to 100%.
CXR showed worsening RLL process, and ECG was unremarkable.
Right IJ CVL was placed due to difficulty gaining access, and
blood Cx were sent. She received 1L NS IVF, Zosyn 4.5g IV, and
Vancomycin 1g IV. She is admitted to the MICU for further care
given her hypoxia requiring NRB. Lactate was 1.5 and all other
labs were pending at time of transfer.
.
Of note, the pt was admitted for pneumonia from [**2148-6-11**] -
[**2148-6-15**] with RLL consolidations, treated with Vancomycin and
Cefepime, with a brief admission to the MICU for hypotension and
fever that improved without intubation or pressors, transferred
to the floor and ultimately discharged on a 7-day course of
antibiotics. She was again admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2148-7-19**] -
[**2148-7-21**] with fever and hypoxia, which was thought to be related
to a possible exacerbation of viral bronchitis with atelectasis.
She was discharged with acappella for chest PT to aid in lung
expansion and decrease oxygen dependence. She was feeling
significantly improved on discharge and was doing very well at
home until the day of admission.
.
ROS: As per HPI. Otherwise, she denies any headache, dizziness,
lightheadedness, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, arthralgias, or
myalgias.
