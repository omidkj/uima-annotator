ID/CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is a 66 year old man who has a
history of tobacco use and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the [**Hospital1 346**] CCU after an elective cardiac
catheterization for increasing shortness of breath over the
past four and one half years.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recently diagnosed
with his history of shortness of breath on exertion, however,
no documented pulmonary function tests.
2.  Hyperlipidemia.
3.  Recent diagnosis of sleep apnea.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Accupril.
2.  Lasix.
3.  Metoprolol.
4.  Combivent.
5.  Flovent.
6.  Aspirin.
7.  Vitamin E.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient presented to Dr.[**Name (NI) 35819**] office on [**2191-7-29**], with a history of shortness of
breath on exertion over the past 4.5 years.  The patient
stated that the shortness of breath had worsened over the
past three to four months.  Prior to five years ago, the
patient was capable of walking approximately six miles per
day.

The patient subsequently underwent a stress echocardiogram
for evaluation of this shortness of breath. Apparently there
was evidence of mitral regurgitation but no ischemia on the
study.  Two years ago, the patient underwent repeat exercise
stress test which was apparently "OK" according to the
patient.

On [**2191-8-24**], the patient presented to [**Hospital 21242**] [**Hospital 107**]
Hospital with dyspnea on exertion.  He stated that walking
from the parking lot to the Emergency Department he needed to
stop after walking twenty feet.  The patient was diagnosed
with congestive heart failure and underwent an echocardiogram
on [**2191-8-24**], which apparently showed mildly decreased left
ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 50%.  There
was also concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.  The
patient was started on Accupril and Lasix and was referred
for cardiac catheterization today as an outpatient.

On cardiac catheterization, the patient had normal coronary
angiography.  On left ventriculography, the patient had
severe global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 10%
and mild mitral regurgitation.  His hemodynamics at that time
included a cardiac index of 1.4, pulmonary artery wedge
pressure of 40 and left ventricular end diastolic pressure of
30.  His pulmonary artery pressure was noted to be 44/24.

The patient was treated with Dobutamine and intravenous
Nitroglycerin and given 40 mg of intravenous Lasix.  His
mixed venous oxygen saturation improved from 49 to 75 without
intervention.  The patient was subsequently transferred to
the CCU for further management.

During the preceding months, the patient denied any unusual
symptoms.  He denied any history of rashes, arthralgias,
cough, upper respiratory infection, fevers.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a history of tobacco use and
quit sixteen years ago.  He uses alcohol rarely and does not
use illicit drugs.  He is a happily married man.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination in the CCU, the patient
was afebrile with a heart rate of 109, respiratory rate 19,
blood pressure 96/55 with oxygen saturation of 97% on three
liters nasal cannula.  On examination, the patient was awake,
alert and comfortable in no apparent distress.  His sclera
were anicteric.  On cardiovascular examination, he was noted
to have jugular venous distention with normal S1 and S2,
regular rhythm and no S3 or S4.  He had no murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  He had 2+ bilateral dorsalis pedis pulses.  He had
mild 1+ pitting edema in his ankles.  His abdominal
examination was benign and his right groin arterial sheath
was intact and not bleeding.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's white blood count was 10.1
with a hematocrit of 44.5 and platelets of 282,000.  Chem7
revealed sodium 137, potassium 4.4, chloride 101, bicarbonate
27, blood urea nitrogen 23, creatinine 1.4, glucose 65.  He
had CK and troponin from [**Hospital 21242**] Hospital which were negative.
His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were
within normal limits and his arterial blood gas was 7.40, 42,
86 in room air.

Electrocardiogram showed the patient to be in sinus rhythm at
110 beats per minute with left axis deviation, occasional
premature ventricular contractions and low limb voltages.
His lateral T waves were flat and he did not have any Q
waves.

His postcatheterization film was unchanged from his
precatheterization film.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient, on [**2191-9-3**], was noted to have
an 18 beat run of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia
without any symptoms.  He was maintained on his Dobutamine
and Nitroglycerin drip and Captopril 3.125 mg t.i.d. was
titrated. The patient subsequently had a troponin done at the
[**Hospital1 69**] which was less than 0.3
The patient also had a PPD done which was negative.  His
chest x-ray was unremarkable with no evidence of pulmonary
edema.

The patient was aggressively diuresed with Lasix and his
Dobutamine drip and Nitroglycerin drip were weaned off
on [**2191-9-4**].  He also begun on anticoagulation due to his low
ejection fraction.  On [**2191-9-4**], the patient was started on
Aldactone and his Captopril was titrated upward.  He was
subsequently transferred to the floor after his groin
Swan-Ganz catheter was discontinued.

The patient also had a workup for hemochromatosis which was
negative and a serum protein electrophoresis was normal.  His
ESR was noted to be 25 and [**Doctor First Name **] was negative.  His TSH was
within normal limits.

On [**2191-9-6**], the patient was noted to have a run of
accelerated idioventricular rhythm which was again
asymptomatic.  Due to his recurrent arrhythmias, the
electrophysiology service was consulted.  They recommended
starting the patient on Amiodarone and with discharge
follow-up using [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts Monitor.

The patient continued to be diuresed with Lasix and Aldactone
and underwent an echocardiogram on [**2191-9-7**].  On that study,
the patient was noted to have an ejection fraction of 20%
with left atrial enlargement and lipomatous hypertrophy of
his interatrial septum.  He had normal left ventricular
thickness and cavity size.  There were no thrombi
demonstrated in his left ventricle.  His left ventricular and
right ventricular systolic function were both depressed.
There was a degree of mitral regurgitation present but it was
unable to be quantified.  He had 1+ to 2+ tricuspid
regurgitation and a small pericardial effusion. There was
also a note of mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension.

During his hospital stay, the patient also was evaluated and
treated by the physiotherapist.  He was also begun on
Coumadin for outpatient anticoagulation.  On [**2191-9-8**], the
patient's dyspnea and his congestive heart failure had
improved to the point that the patient was stable and ready
for discharge.

The patient was discharged home on [**2191-9-8**], with
instructions to follow-up with his primary care physician
early in the next week for checking of his INR.  He was also
instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**] in two weeks with
regards to his congestive heart failure.  The patient's wife
was able to pick up [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of Hearts Monitor and was
instructed on its use.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Aldactone 50 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Carvedilol 3.125 mg p.o. b.i.d.

9.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10. Combivent two puffs t.i.d.
11. Flovent four puffs b.i.d.

At the time of discharge, the patient still had some
outstanding tests pending for his workup of his
cardiomyopathy including [**Location (un) **] B viruses and
Enteroviruses.
