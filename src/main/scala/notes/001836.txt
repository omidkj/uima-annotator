HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 55-year-old
male with a history of upper GI bleed, acute renal failure,
who was admitted to the medical Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital1 1444**] in early [**Month (only) 956**] with an
upper GI bleed.  At this point he was found to have a
superior mesenteric artery aneurysm as well as gastric
duodenal artery bleed.  The gastric duodenal artery was
embolized.  The patient presents on [**2-20**] with abdominal pain,
it was intermittent sharp and dull abdominal pain.  He went
to the [**Hospital3 3583**] Emergency Room and was transferred to
the Emergency Room at [**Hospital1 69**]
where he was found to have decreased white cells, stable
hematocrit and LFTs were improving from his previous
admission.  Abdominal CT in the Emergency Room showed
decreased hematoma compared to prior CT as well as some
pericholecystic fluid.  Surgical team was consulted.  Patient
was admitted to the hospital.

pneumothorax, immune complex glomerulonephritis, acute renal
failure, peptic ulcer disease, SMA aneurysm with
retroperitoneal hematoma, [**2151-1-29**] pneumonia, [**2151-1-29**]
increased bilirubin with biliary sludge, status post
percutaneous stent in [**2151-1-29**] by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19731**].
Fluid overload with echo, EF greater than 55% and history of
narcotic addiction and paranoia.

times three.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation.  HEENT exam was otherwise unremarkable.
Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy.  Chest showed
slightly decreased breath sounds at bilateral bases,
otherwise clear.  Heart was regular without murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  GI showed positive epigastric and right upper
quadrant tenderness, no guarding, slight rebound tenderness
in the epigastrium.  There are bowel sounds present.  Abdomen
was soft, guaiac positive.  Extremities showed 2+ edema
bilaterally.  Neuro, cranial nerves II through XII intact.

bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission sodium 138, potassium 3.3,
chloride 104, CO2 25, BUN 21, creatinine 1.0, glucose 92,
white count 13 down from 16 upon discharge, hematocrit 26
down from 28.2.  Platelet count 622,000, MCV 89, 78%
neutrophils, 12% lymphs.  ALT, AST were 27 and 27, alkaline
phosphatase 365, total bilirubin 1.7, lipase 132, albumin
1.8, calcium 7.9, phosphorus 3.4, magnesium 1.4.  Urinalysis
showed [**3-2**] white cells, otherwise within normal limits.
Chest x-ray showed improved alveolar pattern, question of
left lower lobe atelectasis vs consolidation as well as small
bilateral pleural effusion.  Abdominal CT showed gallbladder
with minimal pericholecystic fluid, pancreas is unremarkable.
Hematoma 8?????? by 5.5 cm slightly decreased from discharge in
mid [**Month (only) 956**], slight thickening adjacent to colon.  His stent
in his common bile duct with associated pneumobilia.  This
was a contrast negative CT.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  GI:  Patient was taken to the OR for concern over a
re-bleed of his SMA aneurysm.  This was unable to be fixed by
the vascular surgery service.  Based on its proximity to the
pancreas, the patient subsequently underwent SMA artery
aneurysm on [**2-22**] with interventional radiology service.
Other GI issues during this admission were the presence of
the two biliary stents by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 19731**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19731**]
was aware of his prolonged hospital course and planned to
remove the two some time during the patient's upcoming
rehabilitation stay.  Patient had a PEG tube placed on [**3-23**]
and was tolerating tube feeds.  At the time of discharge he
was also beginning to tolerate solid po intake with only
intermittent vomiting.  Pancreatic enzymes which had been
elevated earlier in the hospital course came down to normal
at the time of discharge.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was in the SICU with poorly
controlled hypertension from [**2-20**] to [**3-8**] and was started on
Labetalol as well as Captopril and Isordil and Lasix.  In mid
[**Month (only) 958**] the patient had an EKG which showed diffuse T wave
inversion.  The patient's enzymes were cycled and he ruled
out for MI.  Shortly thereafter chest x-ray showed congestive
heart failure and patient was diuresed and his respiratory
status improved but echocardiogram at that point showed a
decrease in his EF from 55% in early [**2151-1-29**] to 20-25% in
mid [**2151-2-26**] with multiple wall motion abnormalities in the
left anterior descending artery territory.  On approximately
[**3-24**] to [**3-25**] the patient's blood pressure began to rise again
and was treated with Labetalol, Captopril.  A repeat echo on
[**3-25**] showed an ejection fraction which had increased back to
greater than 50%.  At that point there were still some
residual wall motion abnormalities in the left anterior
descending artery.  The patient was followed by a cardiology
consult service for the remainder of this hospital stay.
They questioned, and it was felt appropriate that the patient
undergo cardiac catheterization for evaluation of anterior
descending artery wall motion abnormalities.  The patient
deferred cardiac catheterization until after his rehab stay.
He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 96121**] at [**Hospital1 190**] for further evaluation and planning of his
elective catheterization.

Hypertension:  The patient remained with significant
hypertension running systolic pressures in the 150's to 180's
and diastolic pressures in the 70's to 90's throughout the
remainder of the hospital course.  Antihypertensives were
titrated up such that on the day of discharge his
antihypertensive regimen including Labetalol 600 mg po bid,
Isordil 60 mg po tid, Captopril 100 mg po tid, Losartan 100
mg q d, Lasix IV 120 mg [**Hospital1 **] and a Clonidine patch.

3.  Neurology:  The patient was stable with normal mental
status at the time of admission, however, on [**3-15**] mental
status declined and at that point CT of his head was negative
for acute CNS bleed.  One day prior to this the patient had
been in the vascular Intensive Care Unit where he was noted
to have three generalized tonic clonic seizures that were
witnessed by staff on the floor.  MRI and CT showed bilateral
watershed infarct.  At this point the patient was started on
Dilantin and his mental status declined.  He was in a coma
for approximately two weeks but then his mental status
improved.  As of [**3-29**] his mental status was at his baseline
and he remained that way throughout the remainder of his
hospital stay.

4.  Pulmonary:  The patient had known effusions at the time
of admission and had an oxygen requirement.  A chest CT done
on [**3-14**] showed a large right lower lobe pulmonary embolism
and the patient was started on Heparin, however, on [**3-17**] he
had hematocrit drops on Heparin so Heparin was discontinued
and inferior vena cava filter was placed on [**3-18**].  The
patient had bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
right throughout the remainder of the hospital stay.  Left
sided effusion was tapped on [**3-1**] for one liter of
transudative fluid with symptomatic improvement.  The patient
still had bilateral pleural effusion at the time of discharge
with an oxygen requirement of approximately three liters by
nasal cannula and the plan was to attempt to minimize the
size of the effusion with diuresis.  His oxygen requirement
was stable at the time of d
