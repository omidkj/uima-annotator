Pertinent Results:
[**2146-12-14**] Echo:
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed
free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at
the sinus level. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#).
There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a small to moderate sized
circumferential pericardial effusion without echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal left ventricular
cavity sizes with preserved global systolic function. Right
ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2146-11-8**], a small-moderate circumferential
pericardial effusion is now present. The severity of tricuspid
regurgitation and the estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure are now reduced.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 63108**] was admitted and given Vitamin K for an INR 6.7.  He
remained on bed-rest until INR came below 5.  His echo revealed
a small, 1.2 cm circumferential pericardial effusion without
evidence of tamponade. Sternal erythema was noted and IV
vancomycin and oral cipro were started.  Additionally, he
developed small, fluctuant collections of the sternal incision.
These were incised and drained to reveal blood and serous fluid.
 There was no pus or evidence of infection.  He remained on
antibiotics and wound was the packed. His INR continued to drift
down.  The erythema continued to progress on antibiotics and the
sternum became unstable.  The patient was brought to the
operating room on [**2146-12-20**] for sternal exploration and
debridement with a vacuum dressing placement.  He underwent a
subsequent debridement on [**12-23**] with the plastic surgery
service.  On [**12-29**] he had a third debridement with a vacuum
dressing placement.  On [**1-2**] he had a fourth debridement with
pec and omental flap.  Please see the operative notes for
details.  He was seen in consultation by the ID service for an
OR culture that grew pseudomonas and for c.diff (PCR positive)
diarrhea.  He was placed on oral Vancomycin and ceftazapine.  He
was started on TPN due to poor oral intake.  He was started on
wellbutrin to help with smoking cessation and any depression
that may be inhibiting his poor oral intake.  Coumadin was
started for atrial fibrillation and history of pulmonary
embolism, but due to his extreme sensitivity toward coumadin,
only low doses were used and INR was checked daily. His
permanaent pacemaker was interrogated secondary to what appeared
to be oversensing, but the electrophysiology service felt that
it was pacing appropriately to APCs.  He complained of a painful
abdomen but was given maalox with resolution of his symptoms. By
post-operative day 25 he was ready for discharge to rehab.  All
follow-up appointments were advised.
