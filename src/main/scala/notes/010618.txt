CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70-year-old,
nondiabetic white male, with a history of myocardial
infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, who was recently
evaluated for a symptomatic prostate.

On physical exam the patient was found to have a pulsatile
abdominal mass by his primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] scan of the
abdomen done at [**Hospital3 **] showed an infrarenal
abdominal aortic aneurysm with dimensions of 8.1 x 8.7 cm.

The patient denied any history of abdominal pain, back pain
or claudication symptoms.  The patient was referred to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] for further treatment and was seen in the office
on [**2197-5-18**].

CTA of his abdomen and pelvis revealed that the patient was
not a candidate for endovascular repair of his abdominal
aortic aneurysm.  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 120**] saw the patient for
preoperative cardiac evaluation on [**2197-5-31**].

A stress test done on [**2197-5-31**], showed a moderate,
fixed inferior defect, mild fixed septal defect, and a
moderate partially reversible distal anterior defect, global
hypokinesis, ejection fraction of 42%.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease; AMI in [**2184**], AMI [**Month (only) 205**] 200;
coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2194-8-9**].

vein at [**Hospital 4415**] in [**2194-8-9**].
2.  Bilateral inguinal hernia repair.
3.  Revision of the right inguinal hernia with mesh in
[**2196-12-9**].
4.  Transurethral resection of prostate, [**2197-2-3**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

who is involved in his care.  He is a former cigarette
smoker.  He does not drink alcohol.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN CAUSES HIVES.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Mavik 1 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Iron 325 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Serevent.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals signs:  Pulse 52, respirations
12, blood pressure 138/80.  General:  Alert, cooperative
white male in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Carotids palpable.
No bruits.  Range of motion within normal limits.  Heart:
Regular, rate and rhythm.  Lungs:  Clear bilaterally.
Abdomen:  Protuberant, nontender, palpable pulsatile
abdominal mass present.  Extremities:  Feet equally warm.
There was a well-healed saphenectomy incision on the left
leg.  Pulse:  Palpable femoral, popliteal and posterior
tibialis pulses bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission, [**2197-6-1**], WBC 8.2,
hemoglobin 12.8, hematocrit 37.5, platelet count 255,000; PT
12.6, PTT 25.1, INR 1.0; sodium 142, potassium 4.4, chloride
103, CO2 29, BUN 17, creatinine 0.9, glucose 82; urinalysis
negative.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 64,
nonspecific ST wave changes present, possible septal infarct,
age undetermined.

Chest x-ray showed no signs of congestive heart failure or
infiltrates, status post CABG and possible sternal revision.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital on
[**2197-6-7**], following an uneventful abdominal aortic
aneurysm resection with an aorto-[**Hospital1 **]-iliac bypass graft.
Estimated blood loss was 2 L.  The patient received 2 U
packed red blood cells intraoperatively.

Perioperatively the patient was given intravenous Vancomycin
because of his history of penicillin allergy.  At the end of
the surgery, the patient had equally warm feet with a
palpable right dorsalis pedis and a palpable left posterior
tibial pulse.

Postoperatively the patient could not be immediately
extubated due to his severe pulmonary disease.  The patient
was weaned slowly and finally was extubated on [**2197-6-10**].

The patient's hematocrit decreased to 24.9 on [**2197-6-10**].
He was transfused with 2 U packed red blood cells.

An episode of melena was noted with a T-max of 100.9??????.  Over
the next few days, the patient had several more episodes of
melena and fever.  He was cultured and was found to have E.
coli urinary tract infection.  Levofloxacin and Flagyl were
started.

GI was consulted for the patient's recurrent melena and
subsequent hematocrit drops.  A colonoscopy was done on [**2197-6-15**], which showed diverticulosis, diffuse colitis,
inflammatory bowel disease versus infection.  Biopsy of the
left colon showed chronic active colitis with ulceration.
Biopsy of the sigmoid colon showed chronic active colitis.
Several stool cultures for C-difficile were negative.  Flagyl
for presumed C-diff colitis was stopped.

The patient's abdominal staples were removed on [**2197-6-16**].
The patient's diet was advanced as tolerated.  Physical
Therapy evaluated the patient for full weightbearing
ambulation.  They recommended a [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation
stay.

At the time of dictation, the patient's abdominal incision is
clean, dry, and intact.  His feet are equally warm with
palpable dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  The patient will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in the office following
discharge from the [**Hospital 3058**] rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. t.i.d.

4.  Atrovent 1 puff q.6 hours.
