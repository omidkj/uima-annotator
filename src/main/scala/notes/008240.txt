Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, recurrent cough with hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2190-7-16**] Aortic valve replacement with a 27-mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic
    Ultra valve, serial number [**Serial Number 85284**].
Mitral valve repair with a 30-mm [**Company 1543**] CG Future
    annuloplasty ring, serial number [**Serial Number 85285**]


History of Present Illness:
62 yo M c HTN, HL initially presented to [**Hospital 1725**] Hospital on
[**6-27**] with a fever and cough 2-3 months after a trip to [**Doctor Last Name **]
[**Country **].  The patient has no symptoms in his usual state of health
other than occasional headaches.  He spent most of his vacation
at a resort on the coast and did some diving in the ocean, but
did not go into the rainforest or have exposure to exotic
animals.
.
He states that his initial symptoms occurred 2-3 weeks ago, when
he developed "chest heaviness", fevers to 101, and a cough
productive of yellow sputum.  When he initially presented, CXR
was unremarkable and patient was d/ced on Z-pak.  Patient
re-presented on [**7-1**] with persistent fever, cough and was noted
to have a mild transaminitis (AST ~ 50).  He also had developed
some nausea and vomiting.  His simvastatin was discontinued.  At
that time, abdominal ultrasound showed mild hepatomegaly without
biliary dilation or gallstones and hepatitis panel was
reportedly normal.  CT sinus showed mild mucosal thickening; CT
head was normal.  He was again discharged home but again
re-presented on [**7-3**] with fever and headache.  At this time, an
LP (glucose 62, protein 23, WBC 4, culture negative, Lyme PCR
negative), CT chest/abd, repeat CXR, Lyme serology, CMV IgG,
malaria smear, and serologic test for babesia was performed.
All of these tests were normal but the patient was discharged on
empiric doxycycline pending final results.
.
He was re-admitted on [**7-6**] with fever, shaking chills, and
recurrent cough productive of yellow sputum with mild streaking
of blood.  In the OSH ED, a D-dimer was positive, and the
patient was sent for CTA chest.  Both this and a CXR showed
evidence of R lung airspace disease (RUL/RML/RLL) and small
effusions, R > L.  He was started on CTX and continued on
doxycycline.  He underwent a bronchoscopy and BAL that was
limited by intraprocedural hypoxemia.  Lavage was sent for
bacterial, fungal, AFB/TB cultures.  At this time, the patient
requested a transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  At the time of discharge, as it
was felt the patient may have a nosocomial infection, his CTX
was switched to Zosyn.
.
The patient states that his fevers are episodic, lasting hours
at a time, and are associated with shaking chills and sweats,
especially when they are high (peaking at 104).  The episodes
occur every few days and occur both at day and night.
.
At the time of transfer, pending tests included BAL results,
ANCA and anti-GBM antibodies.
.
The patient denies rash, weight loss, diarrhea, constipation,
arthralgias.  Endorses genralized weakness.  ROS otherwise
noncontributory.
