Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year old man with a complicated past
medical history including congenital heart disease, chronic AF
s/p AV ablation, on coumadin and worsening systolic and
diastolic heart failure who presents with shortness of breath,
fever and chills. For the past week at home he has had cold
symptoms including nasal congestion and cough. Today he had
worsening dyspnea, new fever and malaise, so he called his PCP
who referred him to the ER for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 100.4, 84, 114/68, 24, 89% on RA. He
initially required a NRB with improvement in his oxygen
saturation so that he was able to be weaned to 5LNC with sats in
the high 90's. He was febrile in the ER to 101. A CXR was done
that showed mild pulmonary vascular congestion, with a small RLL
consolidation that was read as atelectasis vs. pneumonia. EKG
was v-paced that was reportedly unchanged from prior. Labs were
notable for a white count of 11.2 with 88.6% neutrophils, a BNP
of [**Numeric Identifier **], which was up from 5487 on [**2128-4-22**], a Cr of 2.2 (near
baseline) and a lactate of 3.0. He was given ceftriaxone,
levofloxacin and 2L NS (given his elevated lactate) and admitted
to the ICU for further management. VS on transfer were: 98.8,
79, 101/63, 26, 100% on 5LNC.
.
On the floor initially his VS were: 99, 84, 101/65, 19 and 95%
on RA. Also of note his current weight is 237lbs, which is up
from his dry weight of 221lbs. He says that he feels like he
started gaining some fluid a few days when he was starting to
feel sick. Although currently denies any orthopnea/PND.

CXR on admission:
Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained. The
patient is
status post median sternotomy. A left-sided AICD is again seen
with leads
extending to the expected positions of the right ventricle and
coronary sinus.
Abandoned pacer lead again noted on the right. Mild pulmonary
vascular
congestion is seen. Subtle right base opacity is seen, which may
relate to
atelectasis, although early pneumonia is not entirely excluded.
There is
marked enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, given differences
in technique in inspiration, likely similar to the prior study.
.
.
ECHO
The left atrium is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular ejection
fraction is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) due primarily to right
ventricular predominance and interventricular dependence
resulting in dyssynergic interventricular septal displacement,
rather than actual contractile dysfunction of the left
ventricular myocardium. The right ventricular cavity is markedly
dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. A bioprosthetic mitral valve
prosthesis is present. The mitral prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right
atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial effusion.
