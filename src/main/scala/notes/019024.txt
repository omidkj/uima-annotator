Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2199-3-14**] Cardiac Catheterization
[**2199-3-26**]:
1. Aortic valve replacement with a 21-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic
    tissue valve.
2. Coronary artery bypass grafting x4 with a left internal
    mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, and

    diagonal artery.


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with HTN, HL, DM, [**Last Name (un) **] who presented to [**Hospital1 **] with chest pain s/p a fall.  He had been developing
worsening right sided chest pain since a mechanical fall on [**3-11**]
(no LOC).  Paitent described sensation as right sided "chest
deadness" worse at night and with activity.  Sensation woke him
on the morning of [**3-12**] after 2 hours of sleep.  On the morning of
admission his chest pain was worse and he had dyspnea, prompting
his presentation to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
.
There, he was found to have EKG changes, CK 542, TropI 15.7, Cr
1.8, BNP 1040.  He was started on Lasix and an NTG gtt and
transferred her for futher eval.  A head CT was done that was
negative for bleed.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] CCU and
underwent cardiac catherization [**3-14**] which showed 3VD, and
patient
underwent successful PCI and stent of RCA.  Patient medically
treated with BIPAP and lasix gtt and transferred to inpatient
floor on [**2199-3-16**]. On [**2199-3-17**] patient triggered on floor x2 with
acute SOB, RAF,and confusion. Again medically treated with
lasix,
lopressor and amiodarone (converted to sinus rhythm on [**2199-3-18**]).
Triggered again on [**2199-3-19**] for respiratory distress, poor
oxygenation and transferred back to CCU for aggressive diuresis.

Consulted today for surgical evaluation for AVR/CABG.

[**2199-3-14**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
three
vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild nonobstructive

disease. The mid LAD was occluded after a diagonal branch with
70%
stenosis. The LAD was heavily calcified. The LCx was occluded
proximally, with an occluded OM. The RCA had a 90% proximal
stenosis
with diffuse disease distally.
2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated mildly elevated right and
moderately elevated left sided filling pressures (RVEDP 15 mm
Hg, PWCP
mean 23 mm Hg, respectively). There was moderate pulmonary
arterial
hypertension (PASP 49 mm Hg). The systemic arterial blood
pressure was
low-normal (SBP 105 mm Hg) with sinus tachycardia. The cardiac
index was
depressed at 1.9 l/min/m2. The systemic vascular resistance was
high
normal (1422 dynes-sec/cm5). The pulmonary vascular resistance
was
elevated (267 dynes-sec/cm5).
3. Successful PCI of the proximal RCA with a 3.0x12mm Vision
BMS,
post-dilated to 3.5mm proximally.
4. Unsuccessful attempts to cross the LAD with Choice PT ES and
Choice
PT [**Name (NI) 9165**] Int wires. Further attempts were deferred to spare
additional
radiation and contrast exposure.

[**2199-3-26**] Cardiac Catheterization
Pre-Bypass:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen
in the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-35 %).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with normal free wall
contractility.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). There is little movement of the
left coronary cusp, and the right and non-coronary cusps don't
move at all. .No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric,
anteriorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**2199-3-26**] at
0845.

Post-Bypass
The patient is in SR on Epinephrine infusion.
The aortic valve prosthesis is well seated with no leak and no
AI. Residual mean gradient = 14.
MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 86253**] improved, still moderate.
Biventricular systolic fxn is much the same as pre-bypass, with
EF 30 - 35%.
Aorta intact.

[**2199-3-19**] Carotid Ultrasound
There is less than 40% stenosis within the internal carotid
arteries bilaterally.



Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with diabetes, hyperlipedemia, and hypertension without
past known CV disease presents with chest discomfort and ST
depression consistent with NSTEMI.
.
# NSTEMI:
Patient with TIMI score of 5, presented with elevated cardiac
biomarkers (CK peak 1683 with Trop 9.6) and resolved chest pain.
 Patient denied past CV disease, though his EKG suggestted prior
inferior MI.  He was started on a heparin drip on presentation.
He was loaded with clopidogrel, placed on aspirin and
atorvastatin high dose.  [**3-13**] preliminary transthoracic
echocardiogram decreased EF, severe aortic stenosis (estimated
aortic valve area ~0.8 cm2), moderate to severe mitral
regurgita
