Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 633**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status per ED. Per patient, I am not sure why I
am here

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
percutaneous cholecystostomy tube


History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 year old woman with schizophrenia (some records
indicate dementia too), a history of pulmonary embolism in [**2156**]
(bilateral pulmonary emboli: large saddle embolus in the right
main pulmonary artery and segmental left lower lobe branches),
and deep venous thrombosis in [**2153**] on Coumadin who presented
from her nursing home (living at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in [**Location (un) 14307**]) with altered mental status. ED notes says that she was
found non verbal , confused, and with hypoxia. In [**Hospital1 18**] ED she
was found to have hypoxemia and she underwent CT of the chest,
PE protocol (CTA) and leg ultrasoud. She was also found to have
severe microcytic anemia with gauiac positive brown stools. The
CTA showed decrease in the pulmonary embolism involving the
segmental and subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe
(chronic pulmonary embolism versus residual embolus from a prior
event). The leg ultrasoud did not show leg venous thrombosis.
The patient was admitted for further work up.

In terms of her presenting symptom, the patient can not provide
any meaningful history. In fact, she is unsure why she is in the
hospital. She is alert but not oriented to time (day, month, or
year; states its year 1211) or place (she knows the address of
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] but not the name of the index hospital, the city
or the state. On the other [**Known lastname **] she knows I am a doctor and that
[**Last Name (un) 2753**] is the president). She has good attention span and denied
hallucinations or paranoia. She denied all symptoms. Most
importanantly she denied recent bleeding or dark stools. She
denied shortness of breath but occasionally uses oxygen at her
nursing home but not sure when (not 24 hours). She has no cough
or sore throat. No diarrhea. ROS: all remaing systems were
reviewed and symptoms were negative.

Of note, our records indicate EGD in [**2156**] but no colonoscopy.
The EGD showed medium hiatal hernia, Schatzki's ring,
esophagitis, and gastritis (biopsy)

Code in old records was DNR/DNI. She was unabel to confirm.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: 99.1 BP: 130/74 P: 108 R: 30 O2: 96% on 3L
General: Alert but not oriented to time (day, month, or year;
states its year 1211) or place (she knows the address of
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] but not the name of the index hospital, the city
or the state. On the other [**Known lastname **] she knows I am a doctor and that

HEENT: pale sclera but anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, no LAD
Lungs: clear
CV: Aortic stenosis mumur

no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
Ext: Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or

Pertinent Results:
EKG-Sinus tachycardia. Other than rate, tracing is normal.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2157-5-28**] heart rate has
increased.
.
CXR [**3-24**]-IMPRESSION: Chronic interstitial abnormality and likely
left retrocardiac atelectasis. Mild pulmonary vascular
congestion.
.
HEAD CT [**3-24**]-IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Stable encephalomalacic changes in the left frontal and right
occipital
lobe, unchanged since the prior studies.
.
CTA chest [**3-24**]-IMPRESSION:
1. Decrease in pulmonary embolism involving the segmental and
subsegmental
branches of the right lower lobe, with decreased caliber of the
vessels,
likely chronic pulmonary embolism versus residual embolus from a
prior event.
2. No acute thoracic aortic pathology.
3. Mild pulmonary edema.
4. A 6-mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule, is unchanged since
the prior
study. No new pulmonary nodules .
5. Multinodular left thyroid lobe, unchanged in appearance since
the prior
study. If this has not been evaluated before, a thyroid
ultrasound can be
obtained for further assessment.
6. Interval enlargement of a single prevascular lymph node.
.
[**3-25**] LENI-IMPRESSION:
1. No DVT in the right lower extremity.
2. No DVT in the left lower extremity up to the level of the
popliteal veins. The proximal left calf veins were not well seen
in this study and calf DVT can not be excluded.
.
[**3-25**] f/u CXR-IMPRESSION:
Mild pulmonary edema, COPD. Atelectasis left lung base.
.
[**3-28**] CXR-FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**3-27**], there
is little change in the displacement of the lower cervical
trachea to the right, consistent with a left thyroid mass. No
evidence of acute focal pneumonia or vascular calcification.
Kyphoplasty is seen in the lower thoracic spine.
.
EEG [**3-29**]-IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous EEG due to
the presence of a
[**5-15**] Hz theta rhythm background with bursts of superimposed
generalized
delta slowing seen throughout the most awake portions of the
record.
This is consistent with a mild to moderate diffuse
encephalopathy
commonly seen with medication effect, metabolic disturbance, or
infection. In addition, the presence of frequent multifocal
sharps and
spike and slow wave discharges seen throughout the tracing, in
the left
and right frontal regions, and most prominently in the right
posteror
quadrant, is suggestive of multifocal cortical irritability. The

increased frequency of the sharp discharges, as well as the
presence of
intermittent focal slowing seen over the right posterior
quadrant, is
suggestive of an underlying focus of subcortical dysfunction
with
epileptogenic potential. There were no electrographic seizures
seen.
.
EEG [**3-29**]-IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous EEG due to
the presence of
nearly continuous disorganized [**4-13**] Hz theta frequency
background, with
frequent bursts of generalized [**12-10**] Hz delta slowing, as well as
focal
slowing over the right posterior quadrant. This pattern is
consistent
with mild to moderate diffuse encephalopathy, most commonly from

medication effect, metabolic disturbance, or infection. The more

prominent focal slowing seen over the right posterior quadrant
is
suggestive of an underlying focus of subcortica
