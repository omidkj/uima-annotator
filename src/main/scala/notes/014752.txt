Brief Hospital Course:
86 year-old female with Atrial fibrillation, history of
diverticular bleeding, now with BRBPR. Upon arrival to the ICU,
pt had HR up to 100's (in afib), and SBP dropped to the 80's.
She then had about 600cc of BRBPR. Repeat hct was 28.9 (down
from 33.8 on presentation). Pt c/o lightheadedness, nausea, and
mild abdominal cramping, but denies CP or SOB. She was ordered
for an additional 2 U PRBC's, and GI and angio services were
notified.
.
A tagged red cell scan was positive within 1 minute, but
mesenteric angiogram of SMA and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] was negative. Pt received
total of 7 units RBCs in the MICU and Hct has been stable for 12
hours, and pt was without complaints. She was called out the
floor and Hct stabilized with only 1 unit pRBC's given to keep
Hct>30. More detailed hospital course by problem below:
.
#) BRBPR: Likely due to diverticular bleeding given severe
diverticulosis on endoscopy. Bleeding scan positive in sigmoid,
mesenteric angiography negative. No localization of bleeding.
Colonoscopy performed.  It was initially felt that she may need
sigmoid colectomy if she starts to bleed again profusely.
Surgery was consulted for this reason.  Patient said she would
be amenable to surgical intervention if necessary.  Continued
pantoprazole and held aspirin. Patient will restart ASA in [**6-15**]
as an outpatient with her PCP.
.
#) Atrial fibrillation: Patient in and out of Afib/flutter. BP
stable with rate 60's-90's.  Initially held verapamil given
possible rebleed potential however it was restarted after BP and
HR were stablized.
.
#) DM: Patient had been on insulin, but this was recently
changed to glucotrol only. Pt currently with poor control.
Started on NPH 14AM/8PM and uptitrated on HISS.
.
#) Hypertension: Initially held Lasix, verapamil, and lisinopril
given hct drop and hypotension.
.
#) Gout: pt on allopurinol at home, held in light of RF but once
stable, continued allopurinol given sx of gout.
.
#) History of CAD: pt with 1 vessel CAD by '[**15**] cath.  Held ASA
but continued statin. Should hold ASA for 7-10 days post
discharge as discussed above.
.
#) Asthma: Stable. continued Zafirlukast.
.
#) OA: continued tylenol for pain. Held oxycodone. Pt to resume
on discharge.
