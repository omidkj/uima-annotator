Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Gentamicin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1881**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness and lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 72 yo female with h/o MCA embolic stroke in [**1-13**],
HTN, tachy-brady syndrome, breast CA, PAF, DM II, Diastolic HF,
and UTIs who presented to her PCP's office yesterday with LE
edema and was called into the ED tonight when labs came back
pertinent for hyperkalemia. Her son picked her up at home and on
transport to the hospital she became weak and lethargic and
required being carried out of the car into the OR.
.
On arrival to the ED vitals were T97.2 HR77 BP137/61  RR17 o2
99% RA. She was found to have a UTI and given her previous cx
data was started on vancomycin and CTX. Her exam was noticle for
lethargy, but arousable, not speaking, and poor capillary
refill.  Her CXR showed  bilateral pleural effusions and ? of
old femur fracture.  Her lab was notable for a lactate of 5.4,
WBC of 10.5, creatinine of 1.4 (recent baseline 1.2).  EKG with
no evidence of hyperkalemia. While in the ED her SBPS remained
stable with lowest SBP in the 110s.  She received a total of 2.5
L of fluid in the ED including abx). Vitals prior to transfer
were 97.2 77 137/61 17 99% on 2L.
.
On arrival she was somulent but arousable.  Vitals on arrival
were 95.6 162/78 16 84% on RA. Her o2 sat improved to the high
90s on a non rebreather.  Her gas on arrival to the floor was
ph7.19 pCO281 pO2 255 HCO3 32.  She was placed on BiPAP and her
gas improved to pH7.30 pCO264 pO2 86 HCO3 33.  She then dropped
her pressures to SBP to 80s which responded to IVF bolus. She
dropped her pressures 2 more times during her centralline
placement which responded to bolus. A left IJ was attempted and
a R IJ was ultimately placed.

Imaging:
CXR: [**2172-4-27**]
This exam is limited due to patient's body habitus and low lung
volumes. There is left-sided pleural effusion with likely
adjacent atelectasis. There is also a right-sided small pleural
effusion causing blunting of the right costophrenic angle. Heart
is enlarged.
The aorta is calcified and tortuous. There is no pneumothorax or
evidence of congestive heart failure. Bones are severely
osteopenic. Likely prior left humeral fracture is seen.
IMPRESSION: New bilateral pleural effusions, left more than
right. Cardiomegaly. No overt pulmonary edema.
.
ECHO: [**2172-4-29**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no systolic prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR: [**5-1**]
Compared to yesterday, the fluid level on the right has
resolved. There is
unchanged mild pulmonary edema, unchanged large layering
bilateral pleural
effusions with an unchanged retrocardiac opacity, likely
atelectasis.
Unchanged left pacemaker terminating in the right atrium.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged hypervolemia with mild pulmonary edema and
moderate to
large bilateral pleural effusions.
.
CT head: [**5-2**]
There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage. Extensive
encephalomalacia in the left MCA territory, with gyriform
mineralization, is unchanged and compatible with a left MCA
infarct with pseudolaminar necrosis.  Mild ex vacuo effect on
the left lateral ventricle is most pronounced in the left
temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**]. There is no evidence of acute major vascular
territorial infarct. Periventricular white matter hypodensities
are again noted, compatible with chronic microvascular ischemic
disease. An opacified left ethmoid Haller cell is again noted.
The bones are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
Large chronic left MCA infarct. MRI would be more sensitive for
an acute infarct, if indicated.
.
Left upper extremity ultrasound [**2172-5-4**]: No evidence of DVT of
the left upper extremity.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 year old Russian speaking female with h/o stroke, HTN, DMII,
A fib, tachy/brady s/p pacemaker, breast CA, and diastolic heart
failure who presented with UTI, hyperkalemia, and severe sepsis.


1. Severe sepsis secondary to urinary tract infection: Presented
to ED with lactate of 5.4, leukocytosis to 12.3, intermittent
hypotension and low urine output.  In the emergency department,
lactate decreased and hypotension resolved with IV fluid bolus.
Blood and urine cultures were drawn and placed empirically on
vancomycin and ceftriaxone (subsequantly broadened to zosyn).
CXR with no evidence of pulmonary infiltrate.  Source of
infection attributed to urinary tract infection with grossly
positive urinalysis.  Started on early goal directed therapy
with placement of arterial and central venous line for
hemodynamic monitoring.  Although blood pressure required brief
support with levophed, hemodynamics normalized and patient
defervesced.  1 of 2 sets of blood cultures f
