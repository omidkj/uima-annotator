HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old
white female, who presented to an outside hospital the
morning of [**2-19**], with the chief complaint of weakness
and sensory changes in the left arm and leg since
approximately 3 a.m. that morning.  Head CT was obtained and
reportedly positive for a right basal ganglia
interparenchymal hemorrhage.  The patient was noted to have
slurred speech, dysarthric, some swallowing difficulties.
The patient then rapidly deteriorated, becoming unresponsive
and right pupil become dilated and nonreactive.  The patient
was emergently intubated, stabilized, and given [**Location (un) **] to
[**Hospital1 69**] for further management.
The patient's coagulation studies at the outside hospital
revealed the following:  INR 4.4.  The patient has been on
Coumadin for cerebrovascular accident in the past;  she was
left with right sided weakness and the cerebrovascular
accident was 14 months prior to this most recent event.  She
also has a history of hypertension and increased cholesterol.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has an allergy to PENICILLIN.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, she was intubated
uneventfully upon arrival.  Pupils were 7-mm and dilated,
nonreactive on the right, 3-mm and nonreactive on the left.
The lungs revealed scattered coarse breath sounds.  She was
tachycardiac, sinus rhythm at 108.  ABDOMEN:  Abdomen was
obese, distended, positive bowel sounds.  EXTREMITIES:
Extremities revealed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
NEUROLOGICAL:  The patient had five to six beats of clonus in
the left lower extremity, positive mild withdrawal to deep
painful stimuli in the right upper extremity, nonresponsive
in the left upper extremity and no spontaneous movements
noted.  The patient does not grimace to pain.  Head:  No gag
reflex.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission revealed the following:
White count 13, hematocrit 40, platelet count 527,000, sodium
140, potassium 3.8, chloride 108, CO2 22, BUN 17, creatinine
.7, glucose 134, PTs 47, INR 4.4 at the outside hospital.

Labs upon arrival after two units of FFP:  INR down to 2.1.
The ABG was 7.44, 240, 34, 24, and 99.  The patient had
ventilation drain placed.  Head CT at [**Hospital1 190**] showed a 4.9-cm x 3-cm right basal ganglion
interparenchymal hemorrhage with blood now filling the right
posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle and filling the right
temporal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] as well with obstructive hydrocephalus.  The
patient had ventilation drain place on [**2-20**].  The patient
also had temperature spike on admission to 102.2.  On [**2-21**],
neurological examination was slightly improved.  The patient
is to continue to have no eye opening, but moved the right
side spontaneously, extended to pain in the left upper
extremity.  She did follow some commands.  Pupils 2 -mm on
the left and 3.5 on the right; both sluggish to react.  She
underwent an arteriogram to rule out any vascular
malformation to cause the bleeding, which was negative.

Chest x-ray showed left lower lobe pneumonia.  The patient
was started on Vancomycin for aspiration pneumonia.  The
patient continued to spike temperatures to 102.9.  The
patient had blood, urine, and sputum cultures sent; all are
pending.

The patient was started on Bactrim for sinusitis on [**2-22**].  On
[**3-25**], the patient again spiked a temperature up to 103.2. The
patient was fully cultured to date.  Sputum from the 19th
showed gram-positive rods.  On the 18th, oral flora.  Urine
is pending from the 19th.  On the 17th it was negative.
Nasal swab was positive for gram-positive rods.

The patient continued on Vancomycin and Bactrim for
aspiration pneumonia and sinusitis.  The patient had repeat
head CT on [**2-23**], which was essentially unchanged with still
significant mass effect.  Neurologically, the patient was
opening her eyes to sternal rub.  Pupils:  Right was larger
than the left.  Both sluggish and reactive, no corneals on
the right.  The patient was not following commands and
extending to pain in the bilateral upper extremities with
slight withdrawal on the lower extremities.  The CSF was sent
and it was negative for no growth.

On [**3-26**] the patient had right IJ line changed over a wire.
The patient had ventilation drain clamped on [**2-25**] and had
trial of CPAP with pressure support.  The patient continued
to spike temperatures to 102.8 on [**2-26**].  All cultures were
sent and all pending are negative including sputum, urine,
blood, and CSF.  Catheter tip also revealed no growth, on
[**2-26**].  The patient was having difficulty with respiratory
status on [**2-26**] with poor saturations.  The patient's PEEP was
increased.  The patient remained on SIMV at 60% with 500
times 6 and 10 of PEEP and 5 of pressor support.

On [**2-28**], the patient bit through her ET tube and a required
reintubation.  On [**2-26**], the patient's ventilation drain was
discontinued.  Sputum culture from [**2-26**] showed rare
gram-negative rods.  The patient was started on Levofloxacin.
The patient was seen for a question of tongue laceration
after intubation.  This required no surgical intervention.

The patient continues to spike temperatures to 102.2 on the
26th.  Cultures, blood, from the 23rd were negative.  Sputum
from the 23rd revealed sparse yeast and rare gram-negative
rods.  Urine was negative.  Catheter tip was negative.  CSF
was negative.  Neurologically, the patient was sedated, not
following command.  Pupils equal and reactive but sluggish.
.................... in the upper extremities, slight
withdrawal in the lower extremities.

On [**3-1**], the patient had ventilation drain replaced secondary
to deterioration and neurological status.  The patient had no
significant change after ventilation drain placed.

On [**3-2**], the patient was seen on rounds and found to have a
new left blown pupil.  Head CT showed no significant change.
Ventilation drain was placed on [**3-2**].

On [**3-3**] pupils were three down 2.5 bilaterally, extensor
posturing in the bilateral lower extremities and withdrawal
again in the lower extremities.  The patient was weaned to
CPAP and to continue to spike temperatures to 102.7, without
any clear-cut source of infection.

On [**3-3**], the patient had tracheostomy and PEG placed without
complication.

On [**3-9**], the patient showed .................... on the right
hand, opened eyes to noxious stimulation.  Pupils on the left
continued to be larger than the right, but reactive and
minimal movement to painful stimulation with increased tone.
The patient continued on Vancomycin for ventilation drain
prophylaxis.  The patient had VP shunt placed on [**3-13**], which
was done without complication.  The patient remained
intubated, unable to be weaned off the ventilator.  She had a
bronchoscopy done on [**3-12**], which showed mucus plugging with
nothing positive growing from her sputum from the
bronchoscopy.

Neurologically, the patient currently opens her eyes.  She
shows ....................on the right hand.  She has a left
hemiparesis.  She withdraws her lower extremities to painful
stimulation.  She does not track with her eyes.  She does
follow simple commands.  She is currently on CPAP with 12 of
pressure support and 40%.  Most recent gas from [**3-19**] revealed
743, 30, 96 and 21.  She is alert, following simple commands,
withdrawing both her legs and minimal withdrawal of the left
upper extremity.  Labs on [**3-19**] revealed the following:  White
count 12.7, hematocrit 30.6, platelet count 414,000, sodium
141, potassium 3.2, chloride 106, CO2 17, BUN 17, creatinine
.4, glucose 178.

Currently, she has gram-negative rods in her sputum from the
10th.  She is currently on Levofloxacin.  She has a PICC line
in place.  She is neurologically stable.  She is being
followed by the Department of Physical Therapy and
Occupational Therapy.  She will require vented rehabilitation
bed.
