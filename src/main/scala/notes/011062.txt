pack per day for 15 years.  No recent alcohol use.  Only
drank socially when he was younger.  Denies intravenous drug
use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Admission physical examination
Vital signs:  Temperature 97.4, pulse 85, respirations 21,
blood pressure 128/58.  Respiratory oxygen saturation 95% on
room air.
General:  In no acute distress.
Neurological:  Alert and oriented times three with no focal
neurological deficits.

holosystolic, crescendo/decrescendo murmur auscultated along
the left sternal border and precordium.
Pulmonary:  End inspiratory bibasilar crackles one third of
the way up.

Extremities:  2 to 3+ pitting edema of the lower extremities
bilaterally below the knees.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  No icterus, no pallor.
Mucous membranes moist, no oropharyngeal exudate.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient initially presented to the
Emergency Room after noticing a small amount of blood on the
toilet paper, after having a bowel movement after being
constipated for two days which is not uncommon.  He denies
gross blood in the toilet, melena or maroon stools.  He
denies hemoptysis or hematemesis.  He denies dizziness or
headache.

The patient reports experiencing decreased exercise tolerance
for the two months prior to admission.  He describes this as
shortness of breath after 5 to 10 feet of walking as opposed
to 50 to 100 feet of walking.  He also reports a generalized
drowsiness and discomfort.  He reports increasing bilateral
leg edema for the last two weeks but denies chest pain,
palpitations and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea as well as
orthopnea.  He denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting or
abdominal pain.

The patient was initially admitted to [**Location (un) **] to monitor his
hematocrit given his history of gastrointestinal bleed.  The
hematocrit remains stable and no intervention was performed.
The gastrointestinal bleed was attributed to his hemorrhoids.
There was no repeat bleeding in-house.

A cardiology consult was placed to evaluate the patient's
symptoms of increasing heart failure and history of critical
aortic stenosis.  The decision was made to take the patient
to the Catheterization Laboratory.  Per the Catheterization
Laboratory report, findings at catheterization are as
follows:  Severe pulmonary hypertension and severely elevated
left-sided filling pressures, cardiac index severely reduced
at 1.2 liters/minute/meter square, focal 50% left anterior
descending stenosis with calcified left anterior descending
as well as a distal 70% left anterior descending stenosis.
Mild diffuse disease in the circumflex, 60% diffuse disease
in the right coronary artery.  Valvuloplasty of the aortic
valve was performed, increasing the valve area from baseline
0.29 cm squared to 0.41 cm squared.  The patient tolerated
the procedure well.  He was treated post-valvuloplasty with
Dobutamine and Lasix, right ventricular pressure 90/20,
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and he was subsequently
given a trial of Milrinone which failed, 35.  The patient was
then transferred to the Cardiology Floor Service.  Aortic
blood pressure was 170/90 and he was administered Nutracort
for 24 hours.  The patient was started on ACE inhibitor which
was gradually increased.  His Imdur was discontinued and he
was started on daily p.o. Lasix.  At the time of discharge,
the patient was hemodynamically stable and breathing
comfortably without any distress.  The patient was able to
start ambulating with the help of physical therapy.  Right
after admission it was also noted that the patient had
elevated liver function tests which subsequently resolved.
This transient rise was attributed to passive hepatic
congestion.  He was also ruled out for myocardial infarction
upon presentation.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is stable for discharge to
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; Lisinopril 20
mg p.o. q. day; Dulcolax 10 mg p.r. q.h.s. prn; Ambien 5 to
10 mg p.o. q.h.s. prn; Desipramine 20 mg p.o. q.h.s.; Colace
