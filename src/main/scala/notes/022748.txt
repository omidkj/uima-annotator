History of Present Illness:
This is an 83 yo F with a past medical history significant for
critical AS/3VD CAD, CHF, HTN and a recent history of steadily
worsening mental status and confusion in the setting of
underlying dementia, who came to the ED with complaints of
worsening mental status and diarrhea. She was found to be
afebrile, with labs notable for a leukocytosis to 24,000, acute
on chronic renal failure with a creatinine of 2.1 (baseline
1.5-1.7), and hyperkalemia to 6.0. She was also noted to have
guaiac positive stool and a Hct of 25 (baseline low 30's since
[**Month (only) 956**]).
.
Of note, she has had multiple ED visits and admissions since
[**Month (only) 956**] for CHF exacerbations, increasing confusion and once
for GIB.
Her most recent visit to the ED was on [**2106-5-20**] with complaints
of confusion, and was treated empirically based on evidence of
possible RLL infiltrate on CXR for pneumonia with a 7 day course
of levofloxacin. In [**12-30**], her GIB was found to be due to
gastritis and angioectasias in the gastric mucosa, and she was
recommended to start carafate QID and protonix [**Hospital1 **].
.
In the ED, she was hemodynamically stable and remained afebrile.
She was given kayexalate x 1 and calcium gluconate x 1 for her
hyperkalemia, was given a ppi for GIB and NG lavage was negative
x 2. She was also seen by GI consult who recommended likely EGD
in 24 hours. She was given 1 unit of packed red cells for her
Hct of 25, as well as 1 dose of vanco/zosyn for the
leukocytosis, empirically. She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
further management of her GIB.
.
The patient denied chest pain, shortness of breath, and
abdominal pain.  She was admitted to the medical floor for
further evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 83 yo F with history of critical AS, 3VD CAD, HTN, CHF, GIB
and progressive dementia over several months presents with slow
GIB and leukocytosis.
.
1. GIB: Patient has a history of angioectasias and gastritis
which has caused a hct drop, req. hospitalization in [**Month (only) 956**].
She received 3 units of PRBCs and her HCT remained stable at 34
(admission HCT of 24.9) for 4 consecutive days.  She remained
hemodynamically stable with SBP in 110s and her BP regimen was
slowly added back.  GI consult service was involved during
admission and given her stablized hematocrit it was felt she
could be discharged with protonix twice daily, sucralfate and
follow up with GI as an outpatient.  There was no acute need for
endoscopy during this hospitalization.
.
2.  Pleural effusion/pulmonary edema on CXR, [**12-25**] volume
resuscitation with 3 units of PRBCs with h/o severe AS and CHF.
After she was volume resuscitated she was given her home lasix
dose of 40mg po daily and was weaned off of supplemental oxygen.

3. Leukocytosis: Patient had a significant leukocytosis, but no
left shift, and a predominance of lymphs, with an absolute
lymphocyte count of 12,500 on admission. This trended down
throughout the hospitalization and no infectious etiology was
found.  Patient remained afebrile and required no antibiotics
during her stay. Urine and blood cultures were negative and she
had one c. diff that was negative as well.  The patient
initially presented with diarrhea but had no episodes while
hospitalized. Her caretakers were [**Name2 (NI) 111387**] to call her PCP if
she developed any fevers, cough, or urinary complaints once
discharged.

5. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Patient's baseline Cr is
1.5-1.7. She seems to be mildly elevated to 2.1 on admission and
with hydration her Cr returned to 1.3 on the day of discharge.
Meds were initially renally dosed and her electrolytes remained
stable during her stay.

6. Cardiac:  Given her initial presentation of low hct with a GI
bleed her ASA was held on admission and she will not be
discharged on this medication.  Her caretakers were informed
that she will need to follow up with her PCP in the future.  The
beta blocker was initially held given her bleed and was added
back at a lower dose of Toprol xl 50mg po daily.  This may need
to be titrated up as an outpatient.

7. Dementia: Patient has underlying history of dementia, with
reports
of worsening over the last several months. Given her mental
status all benadryl and benzo's were held to prevent further
exaccerbation.
