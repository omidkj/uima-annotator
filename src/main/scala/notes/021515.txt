Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5790**]
Chief Complaint:
slowly increasing right upper lobe nodule

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy,  videoassisted thoracoscopy, right thoractomy  for
lung mass, nonsmall cell lung cancer wedge resection, and right
upper lobectomy and several bronchoscopies post-op

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 67-year-old gentleman who has a history of CNS
lymphoma and also is status post a right thoractomy with biopsy
of pleaural mass and lung nodule, the pathology of which
revealed a nonnecrotizing granulomas. Since that time, he has
been followed with serial CT scans following the discovery of
the right upper lobe nodule after a bout of pnuemonia.  In
addition he has been followed for bronchiectasis, most
prominently noted in the left lung.  The right upper lobe nodule
in retrospect has been present since [**2190-10-22**] and it was found
to have a increasing in size.  So he presents for diagnosis and
possible treatment with lobectomy.

Clinical:  right upper lung lobe nodule.

Gross:

Part 1 is received fresh labeled with "[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **]" and the
medical record number and "right upper lobe wedge" and consists
of a 5.5 x 2.0 x 1.2 cm wedge of lung with a red and smooth
pleura. The specimen is sectioned to reveal a nodule measuring
up to 1 cm with a red maroon cut surface. A portion of the
nodule is frozen, and frozen section diagnosis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
is "non small cell, favor squamous process." The frozen section
remnant is entirely submitted in A and the remainder of the
specimen with the exception of the stapled parenchyma is
entirely submitted in B-C.



Part 2 is additionally labeled "level 10" and consists of a
single lymph node measuring up to 1.8 cm entirely submitted in
cassette D



Part 3 is additionally labeled "level 12" and consists of an
aggregate of tan-brown and focally anthracotic lymph nodes
measuring 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm entirely submitted in cassette E.



Part 4 is additionally labeled "right upper lobe" and consist of
a lobe of lung measuring 13 x 10 x 4 cm. There are multiple
suture and staple lines identified, representing the site of
prior biopsy. The pleural surface is predominantly smooth, with
no areas of puckering identified. The pleural surface is inked
black and the specimen is bread-loafed to reveal a hemorrhagic
appearing lung parenchyma, without discrete lesions identified.
The bronchus resection margin is frozen and frozen section
diagnosis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9885**] is: "Bronc
