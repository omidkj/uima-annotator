Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization, [**2118-2-17**]
removal of retained catheter with left lower extremity
arteriogram and placement of left external iliac covered and
bare metal stents, [**2118-2-17**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2627**] is a 74F with DM and CHF (EF 50-55%) on chronic
steroid treatment who presents with increased shortness of
breath and tachypnea at her living facility.
.
Of note, she was recently hospitalized from [**Date range (1) 2628**] for a
nonhealing RLE ulcer. She underwent partial thickeness skin
grafting and was treated with a variety of antibiotics:
initially vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, flagyl then cefazolin and
zosyn, ultimately discharged on meropenem for Enterobacter UTI.
Prior to discharge, she developed chest discomfort and was ruled
out for myocardial infarction. She also developed increased
pulmonary edema, and the cardiology consult recommended
increasing his lasix to 40mg daily -- though she was discharged
on only 20mg daily.
.
The day prior to admission she developed increasing dyspnea and
tachypnea. Per daughter, but not patient she was coughing as
well, but patient did not have fevers, chills, or sweats.
.
ROS: No PND or orthopnea, leg pain, asymmetry, h/o thrombosis,
chest discomfort, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
diarrhea/constipation. Does complain of sore buttocks.
.
She was initially sent to an OSH where she was treated with 40mg
IV lasix, 750mg levofloxacin and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
In the ED here, here vitals were T 97.6 P 102 BP 133/81 RR not
recorded O2 83% on room air improving to mid 90's on 2-3L. Her
chest film showed cardiomegaly and [**Hospital1 1106**] congestion
consistent with heart failure, though there was a question of L
retrocardiac opacity.
On the floor, she complained of palpitations and dyspnea,
improved at time of interview.

Imaging
[**2-12**] CXR
IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-severe cardiac enlargement with central
[**Month/Day (4) 1106**] congestion is consistent with congestive heart failure.
 Left retrocardiac opacity is present which likely represents a
combination of effusion and atelectasis, however, underlying
pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
.
[**2-9**] TTE
The left atrium is dilated. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal
inferior wall and hypokinesis of the basal inferolateral and mid
inferior and inferolateral walls. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent with
single vessel CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
three vessel coronary artery disease.  There was minimal disease
in the
LMCA.  The LAD was 100% occluded after the diagonals and filled
via
collaterals.  The LCx had 90% and 80% lesions.  The RCA was a
large
vessel with a focal-mid vessel 90% stenosis and a 70% ostial
RPDA
lesion.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures with LVEDP 36 mmHg and RVEDP 14 mmHg.  There was
evidence of
moderate-severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with PASP
65
mmHg. The cardiac index was preserved at 2.84 L/min/m2.  There
was
evidence of mild systemic arterial systolic hypertension with
SBP 146
mmHg.
3. Aborted RCA intervention due to Guide kinking and tangling in
the
left iliac.
4. Unsuccessful attempt at Guide snaring and removal and
referral to
[**Month/Day/Year 1106**] surgery for percutaneous removal with provisional open
repair
of the vessel.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
3. Moderate-severe pulmonary artery and mild systemic arterial
systolic
hypertension.
4. Aborted RCA intervention due to Guide entaglement.
5. Unsuccessful attempt at Guide removal with Snare.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. CHF, systolic, acute on chronic:
The patient's presenting symptoms of dyspnea and peripheral
edema were thought to be due to worsening of her CHF. The
precipitation for this exacerbation may have been development of
atrial fibrillation. There was no evidence for an acute
myocardial infarction, though she continued to have a troponin
leak. She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from cardiology who recommended
cardiac catheterization. This was performed on [**2118-2-17**] and
demonstrated three vessel CAD; medical managment was
recommended.
Her dyspnea improved with diuresis, and she continued her ACEI
and metoprolol. She will follow up with cardiology for further
management of her heart failure.

2. Atrial fibrillation
The patient denied any history of atrial fibrillation, and there
was no documentation of prior atrial fibrillation in the records
available to us. She was anticoagulated with heparin bridging to
warfarin was begun. ***On the day of discharge, the pt's INR was
1.2. She was continued on IV heparin until the time of dischage;
she will be due to her first dose of subq Lovenox around 8PM
this evening.*** Her rate was adequately controlled on oral
metoprolol, and she remained hemodynamically stable throughout
her hospitalization. Her PCP will adjust her warfarin dosage as
required.

3. Coronary artery disease
She was ruled out for acute MI. Prior stress testing had showed
inferolateral WMAs consistent with single vessel CAD. She
underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2-17**] that showed three
vessel disease. The cath procedure was complicated by kinking of
the Guide catheter. With assistance from [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] surgery, the
catheter was unkinked and removed; a
