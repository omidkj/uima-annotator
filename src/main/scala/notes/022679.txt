History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 74813**] is an 83yoF Russian speaking, with h/o CAD s/p MI
with CABG in [**2110**] (in [**State **]) with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2 in OM/Cx placed in
[**2118**]. DES in LM in [**2118**], Ischemic CMP with EF of 20-25% and
PPM/ICD in [**2116**], paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, CKD with
baseline creatinine 1.6-2.0, hypertension, presenting from home
with acute onset SOB. She states that she was recently told by
her doctor that she has been dehydrated, and that she should
drink lots of water, which she has been doing. Patient's
daughter states that pt awoke this morning with severe shortness
of breath. She had been well night prior, and denies recent
sickness, other dietery indescretion, or changes to medications.
She reports one episode of chest pressure in the last 24 hours,
which came on at rest and resolved within seconds. The daughter
gave her a double dose of torsemide (20 mg total) and called
EMS.  On EMS arrival, she was hypoxic into the high 80s, placed
on a non-rebreather, and nitro-paste, then BiPAP and transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
On arrival to the ED, initial vitals were 74 140/69 30 99% on
BiPAP.  ECG showed a-pacing, old RBBB, c/w prior.  She was
initially given SL Nitro and SBPs dropped from 150s to 50s,
which then came up to low 100s with 250 cc bolus after 2
minutes.  CXR was consistent with volume overload, with a
possible increased opacity in the RLL.  She was given 80 mg IV
Lasix, and given 750 mg levofloxacin IV.  She was not tolerating
BiPAP well, placed on a nonrebreather, and pressures improved.
She had 300 cc in urine output, and improved and looked better
on the non-rebreather.  On transfer to the unit, she was
comfortable, vitals 97.6, 60, 113/50, 20, 99 on Venti mask @
50%.  She put on 900cc to the 80 IV lasix down in the ED.
.
Also of note, her INR yesterday was 3.3 and she was told to hold
her coumadin.  Her daughter also notes that she has had [**2-3**]
episodes of chest pressure over the last several weeks, relieved
with nitroglycerin.

Imaging/Studies:

CXR Portable [**2124-10-20**]:
IMPRESSION: Numerous limitations as above. Overall there is
apparent heart
failure with bilateral pleural effusions. Slightly more
confluent opacity at the right lung base may be secondary to
focal edema versus a concurrent
infectious infiltrate or aspiration. Recommend repeat
radiography after
appropriate diuresis to assess for underlying infection.
.
Renal U/S [**2124-10-20**]: The right kidney is atrophic, measuring 8.7
cm, with an echogenic cortex and mild hydronephrosis. There is a
1.2 cm calculus within the right renal pelvis, similar to that
seen on the prior CT examination. There is a 1 cm exophytic
simple cyst arising off the upper pole of the right kidney.
The left kidney measures 10.1 cm. No stones or hydronephrosi
