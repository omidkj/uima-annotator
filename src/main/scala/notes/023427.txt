Service:  C-MED

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 36795**] is a 58 year-old
gentleman with a prior history of neurofibromatosis who
transferred from an outside hospital on [**2116-9-28**] for
emergent catheterization for an anterior wall myocardial
infarction.  The patient had been started on tissue
plasminogen activator at the outside hospital and had
received Lidocaine in the field for ventricular tachycardia.
The patient underwent catheterization on [**2116-9-28**] and it
revealed the following:  90 percent proximal LAD stenosis
with thrombus and a 90 percent mid LAD stenosis at the
trifurcation with V2 and V3.  The patient received Angiojet
thrombectomy and stent to the proximal LAD lesion and PTCA
plus stent to the mid LAD lesion which jailed D2 and E3.
Free flow was visualized post stent.  The patient was
subsequently monitored in the Cardiac Care Unit where he
suffered recurrent left sided chest pain associated with ST
elevations anteriorly.  He underwent repeat catheterization
that revealed the stents to be open.  His peak CPK was 4900.
In the post catheterization period the patient developed mild
congestive heart failure with aggressive volume repletion.
An echocardiogram obtained on [**2116-9-29**] revealed ejection
fraction of 20 percent.  In the first 48 hours following the
patient's myocardial infarction he had multiple episodes of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.

On [**2116-10-1**] the patient was transferred to C-MED for further
care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Depression.  2) Neurofibromatosis.


MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Paxil 20 mg q.d.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives alone, works with government
records which requires him to be on ladders to retrieve
ladders.  He quit tobacco 28 years ago and only rarely drinks
alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  1) Father died of myocardial infarction at
the age of 72.  2) His mother has an enlarged heart which may
be secondary to a history of acute rheumatic fever.  3) His
brother died of lung cancer.  4) A sister died at the age of
75 from myocardial infarction.  5) He has a son with an
arrhythmia, the details of which he is not familiar.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission to C-MED - afebrile,
blood pressure 120/80, pulse 90, respiratory arte 18, O2
saturation 97% on room air.
General:  pleasant, resting comfortably in a chair.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round,
reactive to light, extraocular movements intact.  Sinuses
nontender, oropharynx clear, mucous membranes moist.
Neck:  No carotid bruit, no jugular venous distention.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rhythm, normal rate and positive S4,
no rub, no murmur.
Pulmonary:  Decreased breath sounds to the left base, some
inspiratory crackles [**12-5**] of the way up on the right.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, normal active bowel
sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  Trace edema with 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses,
groin site catheterization site stable without hematoma, no
bruit.
Neurologic examination:  Cranial nerves 2 through 12 intact
moving all extremities well, gait normal.  Strength 5/5 in
all four.

LABORATORY DATA:  Transfer electrocardiogram to C-MED:
Normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 110, normal axis, normal
intervals, Q waves are noted in V2 and V3 and ST elevation, [**Street Address(2) 36796**] elevations are noted in V1 through V4.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was transferred to C-MED
for further management of his anterior myocardial infarction.
The primary issues surrounding the post myocardial infarction
management were as follows:  1) anticoagulation, 2) afterload
reduction, 3) diuresis.  He remained chest pain free
throughout his stay on C-MED requiring no nitrates.  In terms
of afterload reduction the patient tolerated a low dose of
Captopril which could not be advanced secondary to borderline
low blood pressure.  He appeared euvolemic on a standing dose
of 40 mg of Lasix p.o. q.d. achieving good urine output and
resolving the initial pulmonary findings on examination.

The patient was started on Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. for post
anterior myocardial infarction anticoagulation with a target
INR of 2 to 3.  At the time of discharge his INR was 1.6 on
7.5 mg p.o. q.d. of Coumadin.  The patient's serum
chemistries and CBC are normal.

The patient was seen by physical therapy and cleared to
undergo cardiac rehabilitation as an outpatient.

The patient received nutrition consult for instruction on a
cardiac diet.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.      Status post anterior myocardial infarction with
        status post two stents to the LAD single vessel
        disease.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1) Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., 2)
Coumadin 7.5 mg p.o. q.d., 3) Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d., 4)
Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d., 5) Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. times one
month, 6) Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d., 7) Atenolol 25 mg p.o.
q.d., 8) Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Discharged to home.

DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up with his
primary care physician on [**Name9 (PRE) 766**] or Tuesday in 24 to 48 hours
at which time he should have his INR rechecked and his
primary care physician will give him a referral to a follow
up with cardiology within the next one to two weeks.
