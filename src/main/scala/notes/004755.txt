Service:  MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old
male who initially presented to the podiatry service after an
elective triple arthrodesis of the right foot.  He was
initially admitted for pain control and was placed on
clindamycin postoperatively.  He initially did well, but
began to develop some low blood pressures into the systolic
90s, which initially responded to IV fluid boluses.  These
low blood pressures continued with systolics into the
70s-80s, which required several liters of fluid.  He also
developed a temperature to 101, at which time blood cultures
were obtained which revealed [**1-8**] positive blood cultures with
gram-positive cocci.  He also, at that time, had increasing
creatinine with a peak of 2.6, and began to develop a new
oxygen requirement.  He was 92% on 2 liters nasal cannula.
He also developed some diarrhea, as well as some mental
status changes, and was thought to be encephalopathic.  The
medical consult resident was [**Name (NI) 653**], and the patient was
then transferred to the medical team.

respiration rate 20, satting 93% on [**1-5**]/2 liters nasal
cannula.  Ins and outs - 4,400 in with 300 out.  Bowel
movements x 6.
GENERAL APPEARANCE:  The patient is older than stated age,
sleepy but arousable, in no apparent distress.
HEAD AND NECK EXAM:  Anicteric.  Mucous moist.  No JVD noted.
LUNGS:  Bilateral lower lobe crackles.
CARDIAC EXAM:  Tachycardic with II/VI systolic ejection
murmur with radiation to the apex.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  There was no CVA
tenderness.
EXTREMITIES:  Right lower extremity in a cast.  No clubbing,
cyanosis or edema.
NEURO EXAM:  He was alert, appears somewhat confused, with
notable asterixis on exam.

LABS ON TRANSFER:  Notable for a white count of 11.4 down
from 14, hematocrit 33.1, MCV 104, platelets 192.  Chem-7
with a sodium of 136, K 4.6, chloride 108, bicarb 16, BUN 54,
creatinine 2.6 up from 2.5, glucose 126, calcium 8.2, mag
1.9, phos 4.4.  Coags were notable for an INR of 1.4.  Blood
cultures at this time were notable for [**12-8**] gram-positive
cocci in pairs and clusters.  Previous C. diff toxin was
negative.  EKG appeared sinus with a rate of 114.  No ST
elevation.  No clear markers of ischemia or tamponade were
noted.

HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  The patient
appeared to be in sepsis which was likely due to globalized
sepsis from his Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus
which later grew out of his blood.  The source of this was
somewhat unclear.  It was initially thought to be related to
his foot surgery, although his foot appeared clean per
podiatry notes.  He initially was placed on vancomycin,
Flagyl and gentamicin.  He was transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit initially where he received several liters of IV
fluids, and antibiotics were continued.  He did well and
maintained his blood pressure with improvement in his
creatinine and pulmonary status.  He was transferred back to
the floor.  While back on the floor, his gentamicin was DC'd.
He was afebrile the day of discharge, and follow-up cultures
continued to remain negative.  He received a TTE and later a
TEE to evaluate for endocarditis, which showed no evidence of
thrombus or vegetation.  A PICC line was placed for a 14-day
course of vancomycin, as the patient could not receive
penicillin derivatives or fluoroquinolones.

2) DIARRHEA:  Based on his clinical history, there was a very
high suspicion for C. diff infection as the cause of the
patient's diarrhea.  He had been on clindamycin as an
outpatient and was continued on clindamycin as monotherapy as
an inpatient.  His clindamycin was DC'd, and he had numerous
C. diff studies for toxin A which were negative.  A C. diff
toxin B assay was sent which was not available at the time of
discharge.  He was treated empirically for C. diff colitis
with a 14-day course of Flagyl with gradual improvement in
his diarrhea.

3) CARDIOVASCULAR:  During his initial presentation to the
medical team, the patient developed atrial fibrillation with
rapid ventricular response into the 150s.  He was initially
given IV Lopressor and then po Lopressor with adequate
response while in the Intensive Care Unit, and his heart rate
was maintained.  Approximately 3 days after the onset of his
atrial fibrillation, he was sent for TEE and was cardioverted
successfully.  He was placed on Coumadin, became therapeutic,
and was discharged on a 6-week course of Coumadin, and to
have his INR checked at rehab.

4) RENAL:  He developed what appears to be acute renal
failure secondary to sepsis, which resolved with the
resolution of his sepsis and aggressive IV fluid management.

5) PULMONARY:  He had an initial O2 requirement which was
likely secondary to his sepsis.  He did not have any evidence
of systolic congestive heart failure on echo, and his
transient O2 requirement was likely secondary to capillary
leak which later resolved.  He did not require intubation
during his hospital course and was satting well on room air
at the time of discharge.

6) PODIATRY:  His postop wound remained clean throughout his
hospital course, and he was discharged in a cast to be
followed up in [**4-10**] days, and to be changed by podiatry.
