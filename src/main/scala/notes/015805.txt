Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. No spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: No spontaneous echo contrast in
the body of the RA. A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA.
Good RAA ejection velocity (>20cm/s). No thrombus in the RAA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Normal
LV cavity size. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). Transmitral Doppler
E>A and TDI E/e' <8 suggesting normal diastolic function, and
normal LV filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Doppler parameters are
most consistent with normal LV diastolic function.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Trivial
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.
Conclusions
Pre-CPB:

The left atrium is normal in size. . No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium. Right atrial
appendage ejection velocity is good (>20 cm/s). No thrombus is
seen in the right atrial appendage
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal diastolic
function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter.
No thoracic aortic dissection is seen.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 25457**] was transferred from outside hospital with left
main coronary disease. She was appropriately worked up for
bypass surgery and on [**4-17**] she was brought to the operating room
where she underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x 2. Please
see operative report for surgical details. Following surgery she
was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated without difficulty. Beta-blocker/Aspirin/Statin
and diuresis was initiated. All lines and drains were
discontinued in a timely fashion, without complication. POD#1
she continued to progress and was transferred to the step down
unit for further monitoring. Physical therapy was consulted for
strength and mobility evaluation. The remainder of her
postoperative course was essentially uneventful. Due t
