Pertinent Results:
[**2166-1-13**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated two vessel disease. The LMCA had non-obstructive
coronary
disease. The LAD had a 70% stenosis mid-vessel. The LCx was
diffusely
diseased. The RCA had an 80% mid-vessel stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed normal right and left sided
filling
pressures with v waves to 25mm Hg.

[**2166-1-19**] CXR
The patient is status post sternotomy. Allowing for differences
in
positioning, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely stable.
A right-sided pacemaker is present, with lead tips over right
atrium and right ventricle. There is some patchy increased
retrocardiac density and atelectasis at the left base. There is
minimal blunting of left greater than right costophrenic angles,
consistent with minimal pleural fluid. Upper zone
redistribution, without other evidence of CHF.

Compared with [**2166-1-16**], there has been partial interval clearing
of opacity at the right base and of the right effusion.
Atelectasis at the left base is slightly worse.

[**2166-1-14**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. There is
moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **]
prior to surgical incision.

Post-bypass:

The patient is not receiving inotropic support post-CPB.
There is a bioprosthetic valve well-seated in the mitral
position with good leaflet excursion. There is no transvalvular
regurgitation . The [**Location (un) **] transvalvular gradient is approximately
7 mm Hg with the valve area approximately 2.3 cm2.
Biventricular systolic function is preserved and similar to
pre-bypass function. All other findings consistent with
pre-bypass findings.
The aorta is intact post-decannulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Presented for cardiac catheterization as preoperative workup and
was admitted post procedure.  He completed preoperative
evaluation and on hospital day two he was brought to the
operating room for coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral
valve replacement surgery. Please see operative note for
details. He received vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics.
Post operatively he was transferred to the intensive care unit
for management.  Electrophysiology interrogated his pacemaker
that evening.  In the first twenty four hours he was weaned from
sedation, awoke, and was extubated without complications.  He
remained in the intensive care unit for pulmonary and
hemodynamic management.  Physical therapy worked with him on
strength and mobility. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. He had a brief episode of atrial
fibrillation which converted with beta blockade. He had loose
stools which resolved when discontinuing his Colace. He
continued to make steady progress and was discharged to Life
care rehab in [**Location 15289**]. He will follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist and his primary care physician as an
outpatient.
