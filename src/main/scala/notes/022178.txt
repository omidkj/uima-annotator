HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81-year-old female
with a history of recent CABG with AVR, CHF, protein S
deficiency who presented from [**Hospital3 **] in the
morning on [**2162-2-14**] with fever and respiratory distress.  She
was felt at [**Hospital1 **] to be in CHF versus pneumonia and was
given levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and Lasix.  They were unable
to contact her proxy and thus sent her to EMS, as her oxygen
saturation decreased to 90 percent on nonrebreather.

In the ambulance, she was given morphine and BiPAP was
attempted, but her saturations decreased and she was
intubated in the field.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Recent CAD, status post CABG and AVR
in [**11-26**] complicated postoperatively by multiple recurrent
episodes of congestive heart failure versus pulmonary disease
of unclear etiology.

Protein S deficiency with recurrent DVTs and PEs.

Schizophrenia.

Chronic renal insufficiency with creatinine ranging between
1.3 to 1.5.

CHF with an EF of 25 percent by echo in [**11-26**].

COPD.

Dementia.

History of MRSA.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Singulair 10 mg by mouth every day.
2. Coumadin.
3. Colace 100 mg by mouth two times a day.
4. Aricept 10 mg at bedtime.
5. Aspirin 81 mg a day.
6. [**Doctor First Name **] 60 mg a day.
7. Protonix 40 mg a day.
8. Advair 100/50 mcg.

15.      Lasix 60 mg two times a day.
16.      Ceftriaxone 1 g.
17.      Levofloxacin 500 mg.


ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit tobacco several years ago,
lived in [**Hospital3 **] prior to her hospitalization in
[**Month (only) 1096**]; however, after her operation in [**Month (only) 1096**] had a
prolonged hospital course with multiple attempts of
extubation and difficulties with this resulting in severely
deconditioned patient and need for [**Hospital3 **]
afterwards.  She has been in there since her discharge in
[**Month (only) 404**].  Her husband lives in a nursing home.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Notable for temperature of 102.6,
blood pressure of 100/39, and assist control 16/450 with 5
PEEP.  Lungs with bilateral coarse rales and rhonchi with
mechanical ventilation in all lung fields.  Neurological
examination, the patient opens eyes to voice.  Cranial nerves
II through XII intact, withdraws all 4 extremities to
peripheral painful stimuli, and toes are upgoing on the
right.

LABORATORY DATA:  Notable labs on admission were white count
of 7.8 with left shift, hematocrit of 27.1, INR of 1.6, and
creatinine of 1.2.

ABG 7.28, 67, 341 on AC 14/400.

RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES:  Chest x-ray with pulmonary
interstitial edema consistent with CHF and left pleural
effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit for further care.  Problem list at this time
included respiratory distress, congestive heart failure,
pneumonia, anemia, fever.  In addition, in the emergency
room, she had a left internal jugular line placed, which on
chest x-ray was noted to be cannulating the carotid.  This
was removed, FFP was given, and pressure was held for 1 hour
with no adverse events on follow-up CAT scan of the neck.
The patient was noted to have a left-sided pneumothorax,
which in comparison to CAT scan from her hospitalization in
[**12-27**] seemed to be there at that time also.

Respiratory distress.  The patient was intubated in the
field.  She initially was diuresed and a repeat
echocardiogram demonstrated an EF of 25 percent again with an
LV aneurysm.

She also continued to spike a fever and levofloxacin and
Flagyl were started.  On [**2162-2-17**], she continued to have
fevers and bronchoscopy was performed.  During her previous
admission, she had much difficulty being extubated and
bronchoscopy at that time had revealed tracheomalacia and the
patient was given a tracheal and left main stem bronchial
stent, which made it then easy for her to be extubated.  On
the repeat bronchoscopy on [**2162-2-17**], the stents were found to
be in place, and the patient was found to have no further
problems with her tracheomalacia.  However, she continued to
have difficulty with weaning off her vent and with continuous
fevers.

A CAT scan of the chest on [**2162-2-19**] demonstrated increased
cervical lymphadenopathy, a small stable pneumothorax,
hydropneumothorax, and left lower lobe consolidation.  Two
days later, the BAL returned with MRSA positivity, which she
has had in the past.  Although this is likely a colonizer,
vancomycin was started in addition to levofloxacin and Flagyl
on [**1-/2087**].

In addition, LENIs were ordered, which were negative for DVT.

On [**2-23**], the patient was able to tolerate pressure support
in the morning and thus was extubated later in the day on to
BiPAP.  She eventually was able to tolerate being off of the
BiPAP overnight, but then had recurrent respiratory distress
in the morning of [**2-24**].  At this time, she refused strongly
and clearly BiPAP and re-intubation.  She was able to state
back her understanding that she was going to die and
understood that we would make her as comfortable as possible.
She was allowed to discuss this with her family who agreed to
honor her wishes.

The patient's daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 30864**] was her proxy and also
went in and spoke to her mother and confirmed that her
mother's wishes were to be CMO.

On [**2162-2-24**], the patient was given IV morphine and made as
comfortable as possible and passed soon after.

A postmortem was declined by the family.

In addition to the above hospital course, there were multiple
other problems that contributed very little to her final
outcome such as a minor GI bleed with hematocrit of 27
requiring 2 units of packed red blood cells, worsening
chronic renal insufficiency up to 1.4 to 1.5 that improved
with hydration, and agitation, anxiety that was treated with
her outpatient psychiatric medications.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Multifocal pneumonia.

Congestive heart failure.

Chronic pneumothorax.

Gastrointestinal bleeding.

Anemia.

Respiratory distress.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  None.
