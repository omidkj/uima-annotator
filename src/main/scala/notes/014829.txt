Chief Complaint:

Cardiac Catheterization
Placement of tunneled right internal jugular central venous line


History of Present Illness:
68yo woman with h/o NHL s/p SCT in [**2199**] who presented to the ED
with acute onset shortness of breath.

She describes waking up at 5am on the day of admission because
of severe pain from post-herpetic neuralgia in her left face.
She then began feeling very short of breath and wheezy for the
next 20 minutes.
No associated chest pain. No fevers or chills. No nausea or
vomiting. She has otherwise been feeling well. She denies any
similar symptoms in the past. She has not had any orthopnea or
prior episodes of PND. No pleuritic chest pain, no dyspnea on
exertion, no LE edema or weight gain. She has been able to mow
the lawn and go up a flight of stairs without any difficulty. No
recent travel. She does not have a personal or family history of
blood clots nor does she have a history of miscarriages. She had
tacos last night for dinner. No nausea or vomiting.

In the ED, initial VS were: 97.5 192/101 128 24 86% RA. Her
oxygen improved to 100% on NRB. She appeared to have increased
work of breathing and she had b/l rales on exam; guaiac was
negative. BNP was elevated at [**Numeric Identifier 59336**]. The team was concerned
about the possibility of PE, but they did not obtain CTA chest
because of her advanced kidney disease. The ED team felt that PE
was high enough on their differential that they opted to treat
with a heparin gtt. They obtained a CT head, which showed some
lacunes that were new as compared to [**2199**]. Neurology was
consulted to advise whether anticoagulation would be safe. After
discussing with oncology, heparin gtt was started. Although the
team was concerned about the possibility of heart failure, she
was given SL nitroglycerin and ASA but not started on lasix or
BP medications. She did receive clindamycin and levofloxacin for
concern of a possible RLL infiltrate. She was also given
prednisone 60mg x 1 because of the possibility that she might be
adrenally insufficient on chronic steroids.

Upon arrival to the ICU, she reported feeling comfortable. Her
pain was mild and she was not having any difficulty breathing.


Past Medical History:
- Large Cell Lymphoma: Diagnosed [**2197**], s/p allogeneic SCT in
[**6-13**]. Has had multiple regimens of chemotherapy c/b GVHD
- Chronic Graft vs Host Disease, mild (cutaneous, liver)
- CKD Stage V: Unclear if secondary to chemotherapy,
cyclosporin, or GVHD. Had LUE AV fistula placed but found to
have occluded left brachiocephalic vessel on fistalugram
- Hyponatremia felt to be due to increased fluid intake
- s/p Thyroidectomy for thyroid mass, pathology was benign
- Herpes zoster c/b post-herpetic neuralgia s/p nerve block


Social History:
Quit smoking 36 yrs ago. Very occ EtOH use. Married with two
daughters. Formerly worked in human resources at a department
store.

OTHER STUDIES
==============
ECG [**2203-5-14**]:
Sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats. Poor R wave
progression
in leads V1-V3. Cannot rule out old anteroseptal myocardial
infarction.
Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2203-2-15**] there has been interval loss of R
wave in leads V2-V3.

Chest Radiograph [**2203-5-14**]:
CONCLUSION:
Added density at the right costophrenic angle is suggestive of
an infiltrate.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is
suggestive of a small basal effusion.

CT Head W/O Contrast [**2203-5-14**]:
CONCLUSION:
Periventricular ischemia and scattered lacunar infarcts. No
intracranial
hemorrhage.

CT Chest W/O Contrast [**2203-5-14**]:
CONCLUSION:
1. Bibasal effusions along with increased interstitial markings
and confluent
ground-glass opacities predominantly in the upper lobes. The
differential
considerations are fluid overload, or CHF. Please correlate
clinically.
2. Scattered tiny calcific densities in the left breast may
represent
fibroadenomas. Mammography is recommended on a non-emergent
basis.
3. No mediastinal masses.

Transthoracic Echocardiogram [**2203-5-17**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
borderline dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is probably mildly depressed (LVEF=~40-45%? %) with basal
inferior hypokinesis and possible septal hypokinesis (views are
technically suboptimal for assessment of regional wall motion).
Diastolic function could not be adquately assessed. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
--Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2203-1-6**],
the left ventricle is now more dilated, left ventricular
systolic function is more depressed with new regional wall
motion abnormality, the mitral valve chordae appear tethered,
mitral regurgitation is now much more prominent.
