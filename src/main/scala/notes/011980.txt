Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3290**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 34909**] is a 63 year old woman with history of MVR on
coumadin, dCHF (EF 55%), and COPD on 3L NC who presents to the
ED from pulmonology clinic with significant hypoxia with
exertion (73% on 3L NC).
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T [**Age over 90 **] F,P 64, BP 122/82, RR 20, O2
sat 94% on 8L NC. EKG was unchanged compared to baseline and
without ischemic changes. Labs were significant for BNP 3077
(baseline 800), INR 9.5, Cr 1.2 (baseline), lactate 4.0. CXR
showed interstitial edema and bilateral pleural effusions.
Patient was given nebulizers, solumedrol 125mg IV without
significant improvement in her symptoms.  Due to significant
desaturations to 70's% with exertion she was admitted to the
ICU.
.
On the floor, patient appears comfortable. She denies any recent
change in her baseline shortness of breath.  She reports only
being able to ambulate a few yards before needing to rest at her
baseline.  She admits to over a month of increased fatigue,
daytime sleepiness, nausea, and headaches.  She believes overall
she has lost weight in the last year but reports currently
feeling swollen and admits to increased feet edema. She admits
that she does not take her lasix on days that she is going
leaving her house because of her frequent need to urinate on her
lasix dose.  She reports missing 3 days of lasix in the last
week.
.
She denies fevers, chills, abdominal pain, chest pain, wheezing,
[**Age over 90 **], diarrhea, dysuria, sick contacts, increased [**Name2 (NI) **],
diaphoresis, lightheadedness, change in vision, loss of
consciousness, focal weakness.

[**Company 2676**],
no asbestos or TB exposure.  She quit smoking in [**2179**] after
smoking a pack per day for 35 to 40 years.  She denies any
illicit drug use.  She drinks occasional alcohol.  There are no
birds or pets at home.

Family History:

Neck: supple, JVP difficult to assess given habitus, no LAD
Lungs: Good air movement, decreased breath sounds at bilateral
bases, crackles in bottom two thirds of lung fields, no wheezes,
 no stridor
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, mechanical S1,, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
GU: foley in place
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, bilateral nonpitting edema,
no clubbing, cyanosis

By discharge on [**11-7**], her weight was 291 lbs, her lungs were
clear, albeit with diminished air entry throughout.  Non pitting
edema both legs.

CXR:
FINDINGS: The lateral view is nondiagnostic due to respiratory
motion. The
technologist notes the patient was unable to stay still for the
lateral.

There is blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles
suggesting bilateral effusions. Pulmonary vascular
indistinctness is evident. There is mild prominence of the
intralobular septate. No definite focal consolidation is seen.
There is evidence of prior valve surgery. The cardiac silhouette
is markedly enlarged consistent with cardiomegaly. Please note
multiple prior studies are available, the most recent, however,
dating [**2182-9-18**]. The visualized osseous structures
reveal mild multilevel degenerative disease throughout the
thoracic spine and marked degenerative changes noted at
bilateral acromioclavicular joints.

IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial edema, likely cardiogenic in
etiology given
underlying cardiomegaly. Small bilateral pleural effusions.

ECHO:  The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. There is
abnormal septal motion/position. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A bileaflet
mitral valve prosthesis is present. The mitral prosthesis
appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and
transvalvular gradients. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-12-20**],
the degree of AR and pulmonary hypertension detected has
decreased


Brief Hospital Course:
63 year old woman with history of MVR on coumadin, dCHF (EF
55%), and COPD on 3L NC who presents to the ED from pulmonology
clinic with significant hypoxia with exertion (73% on 3L NC).
.
# Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: The likely cause of her
hypoxia and respiratory distress given edema on exam and CXR,
lack of infectious symptoms, or wheeze.  She has poor adherence
to her home lasix dose.  She was aggressively diuresed in the
ICU with improvement in her symptoms.  No antibiotics or
steroids were given.  There was no evidence of acute ischemia or
PE.  She was transferred to the floor.  She diuresed very well
to lasix 60mg IV per day.  Echo was performed which showed well
positioned mitral valve and a small decrease in her pulmonary
hypertension.  Systolic fraction at 55%, suggesting her sx are
still from diastolic dysfunction with perhaps some right sided
heart failure as well. Her weight on day of discharge was 291
lbs, after having received only lasix 120 mg po daily; if
patient watches her salt and water intake, this dose of lasix
appears to be sufficient for her.

# Acute renal failure:  Improved with diuresis. creatinine 1.2
on discharge

# MVR/Supratherapeutic INR: Patient s/p MVR [**Hospital3 9642**] [**2182**] for
severe MR. INR 9.5 on presentation.  Patient denied recent use
of antibiotics or taking additional doses.  She does admit to
recent initiation of Cymbalta which may have increased her INR.
No evidence of active bleeding.  Patient was taking coumadin 4
mg daily prior to admission.  Coumadin dose held on admission.
Her cymbalta dose will be decreased to 30 mg a day on discharge,
and she will continue on coumadin 3 mg a day on discharge.  She
will have INR checked in a few days by [**Year (4 digit
