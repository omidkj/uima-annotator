Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Penicillins / Brimonidine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
difficulty with speech, LOC

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
CODE STROKE EVALUATION by fellow:

[**Age over 90 **] year old left-handed lady with a history of left atrial
myxoma, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on aspirin (large rectus
sheath hematoma while on coumadin), diastolic heart failure, s/p
pacemaker placement for sick sinus syndrome, history of DVT,
CHF,
Alzheimer's dementia, HTN, CRI, and hypothyroidism.

At 11:30AM, she was eating lunch and had "lost consciousness for
5 minutes."
She was unable to answer questions appropriately.  She denied
any
chest pain but did complain of weakness. Vitals included BP
100/60, Heart rate 60, RR 18 and sats 99% on RA.  She was alert
but not oriented.  This event was also referred to as "syncopy"
by [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.  EMS was called and noted a left facial droop.
She was then taken to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  Unfortunately, she is not able
to provide any details of the events.  Her daughters were
notified that she was being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] but was not
with
her at the time.

Patient was evaluated and had an NIHSS 4.  Per radiology, the
well-circumscribed hyderdense lesion at the right cerebellar
hemisphere is more consistent with meningioma rather than bleed.
 Her initial CT evaluation did not show an acute bleed.

Past Medical History:
Left atrial myxoma, pericardial effusion status post
pericardiocentesis, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on aspirin
(large rectus sheath hematoma while on coumadin), diastolic
heart
failure, s/p Guidant pacemaker placement for sick sinus
syndrome,
history of DVT, CHF, Alzheimer's dementia, HTN, CRI,
hypothyroidism, aspiration PNA, right eye glaucoma, lung cancer
on CT scan.


Social History:
 Per [**Hospital 100**] Rehab where she lives, at baseline, she has
dementia and difficulty with short term memory.  She is able to
ambulate independently with a walker.  She is able to feed
herself.

Family History:
Non-contributory

Physical Exam:
Exam on admission:

Limited due to patient being Russian speaking and
interpreter having difficulty understanding her speech.

Vitals:  AF   HR 60   RR 18   BP 130/103 100% on RA
No carotid bruits or thyromegaly.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm with
normal S1, normal S2, no murmurs  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended, no hepatomegaly, 1+ pedal edema bilaterally,
palpable peripheral pulses.

Awake and alert, knew that she was in the hospital but could not
name her birth year.  EOM intact, visual fields full, right
lower
facial droop (per daughters present, they think this is new), LT
intact V1 to V3, palate symmetric, tongue midline, trap [**4-9**]
bilaterally.  Confrontational testing limited by shoulder pain
but was able to hold up arms for 10 seconds and legs for 5
seconds.  There was no neglect and sensation to light touch and
pinprick intact.  There was no ataxia with FNF.  Bilateral toes
downgoing.

Examination at time of discharge:

Tachypneic.  [**Age over 90 **]F 138/64 50s 20-30 100% on shovel mask w/
humidified air.
Pulm: decr. brth snds on L, crackles [**12-7**] way up on the right.

Eyes closed, but opens eyes to command.  She is unable to answer
questions with more than one to two words.  She is able to
follow axial commands.  She is oriented to hospital.
Inattentive.

Speech hypophonic and dysarthric.

Pupils 4->2 b/l, right more sluggish R vs. L.  VFF to
confrontation.  R NLF flattening.  tongue midline, shoulder
shrug intact. L ptosis.

Motor: decreased bulk throughout.  RUE w/ UMN weakness
distribution, with wrist and FEs antigravity only.  Otherwise
symmetrically weak throughout, but likely due to
giveway/effort/attention impairment.

DTRs hyperreflexic on RUE, crossed adductor in LEs with
increased tone.  Otherwise 2, w/ exception of achilles, where it
is 0.
Sensory: inattentive, can not distinguish R vs. L.
Coordination and gati, could not assess.

Right toe extensor, L toe flexor.

EKG on admission:
Ventricular paced rhythm. Atrial mechanism is probably atrial
fibrillation
of [**2109-3-25**] there is no significant change.
TRACING #1

  Intervals Axes
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T

CT head on admission:
IMPRESSION:
29 x 21 mm hyperattenuated rounded focus in the right posterior
fossa. Given
the relatively well-defined margins, lack of edema, and
attenuation slightly
low for acute hemorrhage, a hyperattenuated mass with indolent
growth is
favored. A hemorrhage is not excluded, in light of the
presenting symptoms.
However, there is no significant mass effect, midline shift, or
herniation.
As patient cannot undergo MRI (pacemaker), short interval
followup head CT
would be useful to assess for attenuation stability (hemorrhage
evolves
rapidly) and exclude rapid enlargement.

CT head [**10-16**]:
IMPRESSION:

1. Stable high attenuation lesion in the right posterior fossa,
most likely consistent with meningioma, less likely corresponds
to hemorrhage. However, followup study is recommended with CTA
or contrast CT for further
characterization.

CXR [**10-16**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2109-3-26**], there is
persistent
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral pleural
effusions and
elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Pacemaker device remains in
place.

IMPRESSION: Little overall change

EEG [**10-17**] - Preliminary - mild encephalopathy, no epileptiform
discharges.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old left-handed woman with left atrial myxoma, pAfib on
aspirin (large rectus sheath hematoma while on coumadin),
diastolic heart failure, s/p pacemaker placement for sick sinus
syndrome, history of DVT, CHF, Alzheimer's dementia, HTN, CRI,
and hypothyroidism, who presented with an episode of altered
level of consciousness (no recorded witness account of what
actually happened).
