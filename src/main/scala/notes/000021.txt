Chest pain and anemia

History of Present Illness:
70 year old man with afib on coumadin, insulin dependent DM,
obseity, systolic and diastolic heart failure LVEF 40-45%, CAD
s/p CABG '[**93**], PTCA'[**15**], STEMI with BMS to the SVG-OM graft
[**2118-4-8**], presents with fatigue and dyspnea on exertion over past
week.  He was initially feeling well after discharge [**3-/2117**] and
began exercising and losing weight.  However, this past week
dyspnea increased and exertional capacity decreased.  He called
his cardiologist who thought he might be overdiuresed, therefore
his lasix and spironolactone were reduced to half prior doses.
Dyspnea worsened despite this change.  Then on the day of
admission he had 2 bowel movements, the second of which was dark
black.  The bowel movement was preceeded by crampy abdominal
pain.  He attempted to walk from the bathroom to the kitchen but
because acutely dyspneic.  He sat down and then developed chest
pain, took a nitro with relief.  Tried to walk again but the
chest pain returned, thus called EMS and was brought to an OSH.
There his chest pain was relieved by repeated nitroglycerin and
he was eventually started on a nitroglycerin drip.  Labs at OSH
were notable for HCT 25, INR 3.7, K 7.  Enroute to [**Hospital1 18**], his
SBP dropped with increasing nitro drip doses.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he was chest pain free with VS 97.6
99/56, 74 16 97% 2L.  ECG showed a new LBBB, trop negative.
Labs notable for K 7.2 (not hemolyzed) and thus he received
calcium, D50/insulin, and kayexalate.  INR was 4.9.  GI was
called given HCT drop from 31 to 25 and made plans to scope in
the morning.  Rectal exam notable for brown stool guaiac
positive with specks of black stool.  Nitroglycerin drip was
stopped and his pain was controlled with morphine PRN.  He
received 1L NS.  Vitals prior to transfer 98.1 69 109/41 16 99%
RA pain 0.

On arrival to the MICU, he was initially comfortable, but then
developed chest pain prompting morphine 2mg x3 without relief.
SL nitro was given with improvement in pain.  ECG showed narrow
complex sinus rhythm with ST depressions in I, V4-V6.  He later
had another episode of pain relieved by SL nitroglycerin.

Brief Hospital Course:
70 year old man with afib on coumadin, insulin dependent DM,
obseity, systolic and diastolic heart failure LVEF 40-45%, CAD
s/p CABG '[**93**], PTCA'[**15**], STEMI with BMS to the SVG-OM graft
[**2118-4-8**], presents with fatigue and dyspnea on exertion, found to
have hematocrit drop secondary to GI bleed.

ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:
=================
# Chest Pain: Demand ischemia in setting of GI bleed. He has
known coronary vascular disease with refractory angina that is
not amenable to intervention per cardiology team. No evidence of
consolidation or PTX on CXR to suggest pulmonary cause. Patient
was transfused a total of 8 units pRBCs; hematocrit initially
stabilized and when heparin gtt and coumadin were re-started,
hematocrit dropped again and chest pain returned without EKG
changes. He was continued on aspirin, plavix, and ranolazine.
Imdur was started at a lower dose than home dose given concern
for hypotension in setting of bleeding, but BP remained stable
so imdur was titrated up to his home dose. He then had return of
chest pain, with dynamic ST changes in V3-V5 and I/avL,
consistent with known non-intervenable areas of disease.  His
imdur was increased to 240mg and metoprolol was increased to
tartrate 150mg PO BID without further episodes of chest pain.

# UGIB/H.Pylori + Nodular Gastritis: On EGD, patient had
evidence of nodular gastritis with superficial erosions.
H.pylori returned positive and patient began triple therapy with
amoxicillin (not candidate for clarithromycin given interaction
with ranolazine), metronidazole and pantoprazole.  Coumadin was
held and INR was reversed with vitamin K.  Patient had ongoing
hematocrit drop without obvious bleeding once heparin drip was
restarted, so both coumadin and heparin were stopped.  Pa
