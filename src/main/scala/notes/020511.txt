HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 46-year-old male with
known metastatic renal cancer and known portal vein
thrombosis and biliary obstruction with esophageal varices,
diagnosed in [**2152-4-2**], who was transferred from an
gastrointestinal bleed.  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital **]
Hospital on [**2152-10-27**].  At that time, he complained of
nausea and vomiting times three days, hematemesis, and melena
times two days.  He was noted to have hematemesis in the
Emergency Department and his admission hematocrit was 20.1.
He was started on Sandostatin drip.

[**3-5**]+ esophageal varices without acute bleed and without
stigmata of bleed.  A red clot was seen on the greater curve
of the fundus without an active bleed.  There was an adherent
clot with normal underlying mucosa.  No [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tears
and patient had received nine units of packed red blood cells
with an increase in hematocrit to 23.5.  Patient also
received eight units of FFP for INR of 1.5.  He also received
10 mg of subcutaneous Vitamin K and was then transferred to
[**Hospital6 256**] for further management.
Patient was witnessed to have around 500 cc of bright red
blood with clots in route.  Also, had bright red blood per
rectum at that time.  Patient had not been hemodynamically
stable at any time prior to admission.

normal.  Malignant looking common bile duct stricture with
multiple filling defects and a 7 cm stent was placed.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This was a 46-year-old man with
metastatic renal cancer with known esophageal varices and
portal hypertension, secondary to extrinsic compression of
the portal system by the mass and portal vein thrombosis who
presented to an outside hospital with an upper
gastrointestinal bleed thought to be secondary to gastric
varices.

1.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed:  The patient with endoscopy
at outside hospital, negative for stigma of variceal bleed,
most likely secondary to gastric varices.  The patient was
put on octreotide and Protonix.  Despite this, patient
continues to have active bleeding.  Patient was planned to
have abdominal ultrasound and then Gastrointestinal and
Interventional Radiology to evaluate.  Hematocrit will be
followed and transfusion prn.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Gastrointestinal was consulted and an
emergent abdominal ultrasound was done which showed limited
portal vein flow distally.  A multiphasic CT showed unchanged
metastases with portal vein flow distally but minimal flow
proximally.  Interventional Radiology was contact[**Name (NI) **] and a
portal vein stent was placed along with an external-internal
biliary drain which drained percutaneously in one direction
and also into the duodenum.  Patient received a total of 28
units of packed red blood cells and 23 units of FFP.  During
the procedure, which the patient was stented by
Interventional Radiology, he went under general anesthesia.
There was some difficulty extubating the patient and he was
ultimately extubated two days later.  He developed a left
lower lobe pneumonia, believed to be due to an aspiration
pneumonia during patient's intubation.  He was put on a ten
day course of Levaquin and clindamycin.  Enterococcus also
grew out from patient's bile which was sensitive to Levaquin
and thus treated with a ten day course of Levaquin, also used
for the pneumonia.

Difficult with extubation, secondary to low oxygen
saturation.  Patient was later found to have an abnormally
high AA gradient and also a VQ mismatch.  This was believed
to possibly be secondary to small pulmonary emboli being sent
from patient's existent left popliteal deep vein thrombosis.
Interventional Radiology was again consulted and an IVC
filter was attempted to be placed secondary to patient's
inability to be anticoagulated.  During the procedure, it was
discovered that patient's inferior vena cava was abruptly
tapered secondary to extrinsic compression by tumor.
Therefore, a filter was not placed at that time.  Patient
remained on a 100% nonrebreather for two to three days and
ultimately his oxygen was weaned as his pneumonia resolved.
On [**11-6**], on the day of discharge, patient was
saturating between 92 and 99% on room air and was not
experiencing any dyspnea on exertion with ambulation and
denied any cough.

During patient's intubation, he was agitated on his vent,
and, therefore, started on propofol at which time he became
hypotensive and required Neo-Synephrine in order to maintain
blood pressure.  Patient also experienced acute renal failure
likely secondary to the dye load given during a CT and angio
procedure during the admission.  Patient maintained good
urine output and creatinine rose to 1.8, then resolved on its
own.

The patient's diet was slowly advanced from NPO to a full
regular diet.  Patient at time of discharge was able to
tolerate all foods.  His hematocrit remained stable for five
to six days around 30.  Patient's total bilirubin also rose
to a peak of 20.  Once the total bilirubin had peaked, it
began to drop status post drainage procedure a few points a
day.  In the days prior to discharge it had dropped from
