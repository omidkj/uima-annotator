Witnessed fall with striking leg

Central line placement


History of Present Illness:
This is an 88 yo F with a past medical history of afib and
frequent falls, recently admitted in [**10-16**] after a mechanical
fall, who was brought to the ED by EMS after a witnessed fall at
home. Her husband said he saw her fall, noting that she only hit
her leg, no head trauma, no LOC, no loss of bowel/bladder
function. When she was picked up by EMS to be brought to [**Hospital1 18**],
she was thought to have an altered mental status and to be
slightly tachypneic, which resolved en route. In the ED, she was
found to have a temp of 101.2. She received 1L IVF and her SBP's
dropped from 100's to 70's. An EJ was placed for another liter
of IVF, and her pressure came up to the 90's. At that point a
RIJ was placed, she was given a dose of vanco, levofloxacin and
flagyl, blood cultures and ua/urine cultures were sent. Her UA
came back with moderate leuks, neg nitrates, large blood and >50
WBC's. She was admitted to the MICU for further management of
urosepsis in the setting of a leukocytosis to 20,000, persistent
fevers to 102.3, lactate of 2 and hypotension.

Of note, on last admission she was found to have a dirty UA and
was treated for 3 days on ciprofloxacin. Urine culture grew out
E. coli.

On ROS, the patient denies chest or abdominal pain, shortness of
breath, n/v/d. Admits to leg pain, but this is chronic. Denies
dysuria, but admits to 24 hours of polyuria prior to
presentation.

Brief Hospital Course:
88 yo female with h/o afib, frequent falls, admitted with
urosepsis.

# Sepsis [**1-10**] UTI: Initially presumed to be secondary to UTI
given UA results.  Was, however, also evaluated for pneumonia,
community acquired or aspiration, but chest film was negative
for infiltrate or consolidation. Upon admission was hypotension
but responded to fluid [**Last Name (LF) 1868**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] patient was not in shock.
APACHE II score was 14 which estimated mortality risk of almost
17%.  She improved rapidly with fluid resuscitation and never
required pressors while in the ICU.  Antibiotic coverage was
started empirically for gram negative rods and gram positive
cocci with cipro and vanco.  Was briefly changed to levofloxacin
for improved pulmonary coverage when she developed a cough for
one day.  This was changed to ceftriaxone given her confusion,
but was ultimately returned to ciprofloxacin.  E.coli was
ciprofloxacin sensitive.
Was discharged with continued antibiotics for 10 day total
course.

# Afib with RVR: Was in normal sinus rhythm upon admission but
the evening of [**2188-12-17**] developed Afib with RVR.  Broken with
diltiazam boluses, then diltiazem gtt, with no response to
metoprolol IV (although had been on metoprolol XL 25mg daily at
home).  Was transition to diltiazam boluses, then to a diltiazam
oral equivalent prior to discharge.

# Altered Mental Status: Initially likely secondary to
sundowning versus infection with plan to treat underlying causes
and monitor.  On [**2188-12-17**] did recieve lorazepam 0.5mg IV and
olanzapine 5mg PO/SL x2 with increased delirium [**12-18**] AM. These
medications were not used further.  Much improved with
conservative treatment.  Continued to keep windows open and
re-orient frequently.  Avoided sedating meds and physical
restraint when possible.  Oral medications were briefly held for
her altered mental status as there was concern for aspiration.
Speech/swallow evaluation was obtained and her diet was adjusted
appropriately.  Upon discharge, had minimal aspiration risk, but
patient consistently tries to eat/drink while lying down.  She
will need to be continually sat up for all oral intake at rehab.
 Will need PT/OT at rehabilitation for further treatment.

# Respiratory distress: SOB initially developed while receiving
fluid resuscitation.  Initial considerations included
bronchospasm [**1-10**] volume overload v. aspiration pneumonitis v.
penumonia.  CXR was unrevealing for these processes beyond mild
fluid overload.  Initially responded to diuresis, but wheezing
recurred intermittently.  Albuterol & ipratroprium nebs were
used as needed and she did experience mild relief.  Aspiration
assessed with speech & swallow and diet adjusted accordingly.

# CAD: STABLE.  CAD s/p MI [**00**] years ago. Continued Atorvastatin.
 BB initially held given hypotension, then restarted for Afib
rate control.  Ultimately was not useful, and was transitioned
to diltiazam.

# Hyperlipidemia: STABLE.  Continued Atorvastatin.

# HTN: Normotensive since admission, and home regimen of
metoprolol XL 25mg daily held.  Started on diltiazam prior to
discharge given atrial fibrillation with RVR.  Discharged on
this medication.
.
# Falls: PT/OT evaluation recommended upon discharge.  Social
work consult was obtained for placement.  Should be monitored
for orthostatic hypotension given prolonged duration in bed
while inpatient.
