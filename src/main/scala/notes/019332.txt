right. There is no ptosis. Right NLF is flatter than right; she

She moves left upper extremity spontaneously and purposefully
antigravity. No spontaneous movement of right upper extremity or

and
lower extremities to noxious stimulation. She has slight

MRI: There is a large infarction involving both superior and
inferior
divisions of the left MCA territory.  Evidence includes
restricted diffusion
and cytotoxic edema on FLAIR imaging.  There is no intra- or
extra-axial
hemorrhage.  The ventricles and sulci are prominent, consistent
with the
patient's age.  Subcortical and periventricular white matter
FLAIR
hyperintensities are consistent with chronic small vessel
ischemic disease.
The flow void of the cavernous portions left ICA flow is lost
(4:10).

The brainstem, posterior fossa, and cervicomedullary junction
are preserved.
The orbits, periorbital and paracavernous spaces are
unremarkable.  No
abnormality is detected in the calvaria.

IMPRESSION:  Evolving left MCA infarction with persistent
occlusion of the
left internal carotid artery.
CT/CTA:
1.  Large acute left MCA territorial infarction, with no
definite evidence of
ischemic penumbra and no hemorrhage.
2.  Occlusion of the the left internal carotid artery with
reconstitution of
ICA flow at the carotid terminus.
2.  Approximately 45% stenosis of the right internal carotid
artery origin.
3.  Right P1 stenosis.  No aneurysm.
4.  Focal stenosis of the mid-V2 segment of the left vertebral
artery
secondary to adjacent degenerative changes of the C-spine.



Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 112194**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old right-handed woman with PMH
significant for HTN, HLD and a. fib with right sided hemiparesis
and global aphasia ,found to have decreased
perfusion in the left ACA and MCA territories due to an
occlusion
of her left ICA. s/p tPA in the ED (bolus given
at 1627).  Her stroke is most likely due to a cardioembolic
event
due to her a.fib with a subtherapeutic INR and with the embolus
lodging in the ICA.
1. Neuro:
-post tPA vital signs and neuro checks:initially she showed
improvement. MRI brain did not show any hemorrhage post Tpa but
there was a very extensive ischemic  infarction in L MCA and ACA
territory,but in the afternoon her mental status declined and
she became lethargic, her O2 sat went down to 60s with unstable
Bp, and as her heart and lung condition  were not reversible,her
family decided to continue management as comfort care measures
only.
