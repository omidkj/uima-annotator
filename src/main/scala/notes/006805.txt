CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post nephrectomy and Intensive Care
Unit stay, transfer for cardiac catheterization

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 89-year-old
female who is status post a nephrectomy on [**2162-5-24**] for renal
cell carcinoma.  She was originally admitted to the urology
service and subsequently the Intensive Care Unit and then
transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] for cardiac catheterization.
The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course after nephrectomy was
complicated by an episode of unstable angina while on the
surgical floor with increased troponin to 7.3.  The patient
was subsequently transferred back to the Intensive Care Unit
in the setting of anticoagulation with heparin, aspirin and
Plavix over the unstable angina episode.

The patient experienced a retroperitoneal bleed requiring 4
units of packed red blood cells as transfusion, as well as
reversal of anticoagulation.  Since then, the patient has
done well in the Intensive Care Unit and subsequently
transferred her care to the [**Hospital Ward Name 517**] in anticipation of
cardiac catheterization.  On transfer, the patient was
without complaints.  She did complain of mild shortness of
breath, but denied cough, chest pain, chest pressure, had a
good appetite, was slightly thirsty, was denying any urinary
symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2154**] with left internal mammary artery to
LAD, saphenous vein graft to PDA, saphenous vein graft to OM,
status post myocardial infarction in [**2161-10-19**] with
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent to
the saphenous vein graft and RCA.  The left internal mammary
artery was patent.  Saphenous vein graft to OM was totally
occluded.
2.  Status post cerebrovascular accident with no residual
deficits.  The patient was apparently placed on Coumadin for
the cerebrovascular accident.
3.  Breast cancer status post right mastectomy in [**2147**].
4.  Status post total knee replacement
5.  Status post carpal tunnel release

ALLERGIES:  MORPHINE SULFATE, THE PATIENT GETS HYPOTENSIVE
AND EXPERIENCES NAUSEA AND VOMITING.  PERCOCET, THE PATIENT
GETS NAUSEA AND VOMITING.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with her daughter in a
connected apartment.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  The patient was a pleasant female in no apparent
distress.
TRANSFER VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature was 98.9??????.  Blood pressure
was 140/70.  Pulse was 79.  Respiratory rate was 18.  O2
saturation was 91% on room air.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular muscles were intact.
Oropharynx was dry.  Left ear had a hearing aid in place.
NECK:  Supple.  Right IJ was in place.  There was no erythema
or exudate.
LUNGS:  There was decreased breath sounds at the bases
bilaterally, otherwise lungs were clear to auscultation.
CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm, 3/6 systolic murmur at the
left upper sternal border.  No rubs or gallops.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, some right lower quadrant tenderness, good
bowel sounds, no guarding, no rebound.  The incision site was
clean, dry and intact.
EXTREMITIES:  1+ bilateral lower extremity edema.

TRANSFER LABORATORY VALUES:  White blood cell count 12.5,
hematocrit 31.7, platelets 238.  PT 13.6, PTT 28.2, INR 1.3.
Sodium 142, potassium 3.8, chloride 104, bicarbonate 30, BUN
59, creatinine 1.6, blood glucose was 97.  Chest x-ray from
[**5-30**] showed increasing left sided pleural effusion and a left
retrocardiac opacity.  CT of the abdomen showed moderate
bilateral pleural effusions, moderate ascites and a hematoma
12 x 7 cm abutting the kidney in the retroperitoneal area.
Echocardiogram from [**2162-5-26**] showed mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy, ejection fraction greater than 50%,
at least mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, 2+ tricuspid
regurgitation.  Echocardiogram from the outside hospital was
read as some evidence of diastolic dysfunction.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient had a cardiac
catheterization which showed hemodynamics, aortic filling
pressures of 164/65.  Left main was diffusely disease,
proximal LAD with 90% stenosis.  Proximal circumflex was
normal.  Mid circumflex was normal.  The distal circumflex
had discrete 90% stenosis of OM1, discrete 100% stenosis.
Saphenous vein bypass graft #1 to segment #3 was normal.
Left internal mammary artery to LAD was normal.  There was a
known RCA occlusion that was not engaged or imaged.  The
patient had a patent stent in the saphenous vein graft to
RCA.  No intervention was done after cardiac catheterization.
The patient was hydrated prior to cardiac catheterization, as
well as given Mucomyst to prevent nephrotoxicity.  After
cardiac catheterization, the patient was given intravenous
fluids as well.

Subsequently, the patient started to have an increased oxygen
requirement up to approximately 4 liters to keep O2
saturations between 92% and 94%.  Chest x-ray was performed
which showed pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions.
Subsequently, intravenous fluids were discontinued and
patient was diuresed with Lasix with an improvement in her
oxygen requirement.  Prior to discharge, the patient was 98%
on room air.  Chest x-ray prior to discharge showed interval
improvement in the effusions with diuresis.  For the
patient's hypertension, hydralazine was started instead of an
ACE inhibitor, given the fact that she had recently had a dye
load, as well as one kidney removed, as well as diuresis.
The hydralazine was titrated up to initially 100 qid.
Subsequently, once the patient's creatinine stabilized an ACE
inhibitor was started and hydralazine was in the process of
being titrated down.

2.  PULMONARY:  Given the fact that the patient had these
immune pleural effusions of unclear etiology, initially the
thought was to try and tap the pleural effusions.  The family
requested that the interventional pulmonology service perform
the tap, however, they were unavailable at the time and
subsequently, by the time they were available, repeat chest
x-ray showed a decrease in the size of the effusion and the
family requested that if it was not completely necessary that
no further invasive diagnostic testing be done at the
family's request.  Given the fact the pleural effusions had
improved in size with diuresis, it was felt most likely they
were related to congestive heart failure in the setting of
diastolic dysfunction and mitral regurgitation and a fluid
load prior to cardiac catheterization.

3.  HEMATOLOGIC:  The patient did not require any blood
transfusions while on the medicine service here while on the
[**Hospital Ward Name **].  The patient's hematocrit was checked [**Hospital1 **] after
the cardiac catheterization since she was heparinized for the
cardiac catheterization and the patient's hematocrit remained
stable.  The patient was previously on Coumadin prior to
admission for this history of a cerebrovascular accident,
however given the fact that the patient had recently had a
retroperitoneal bleed while being on anticoagulants, it was
felt that the risk/benefit ratio would favor holding the
Coumadin.  However, this decision will ultimately be made by
the patient's primary care doctor.  The patient was continued
on antiplatelet agents such as aspirin for coronary artery
disease.  It was felt that this would also have antiplatelet
activity to prevent cerebrovascular accidents and would be
adequate

4.  RENAL:  The patient's creatinine after nephrectomy had
almost doubled.  Initially, the patient's creatinine was 0.8.
After nephrectomy, the patient's creatinine bumped to 1.3 and
eventually up to 1.8, however prior to discharge, the
patient's creatinine was 1.3
