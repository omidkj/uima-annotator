Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs.[**Location (un) 61752**] operative course was uncomplicated. She was
routinely observed in the PACU, and transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **] for
post-op care.
.
UGI Bleed:She had a few episodes of dark brown emesis with clots
on POD [**1-24**]. Hematocrit was checked, and dropped from 30.9 to
27.3, and even further to 24.5 which was evident for a bleed. GI
service was consulted. She was transferred to ICU for an EGD to
evaluate for upper GI bleed (please refer to Pertinent Results
section). She remained in the ICU for a few days for blood
transfusion, and close monitoring of HCT's. She had no evidence
of active bleeding per EGD, and her HCT's stabilized. She was
eventually transferred back to [**Hospital Ward Name **], and discharged home a few
days after.
.
ABD:Her abdomen is soft, NT/ND with active bowel sounds. Her
abdominal incision is OTA with staples, healing and intact. She
will have the staples removed at the follow-up appointment with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
NUT:She was NPO post-op. Her diet was advanced as her bowel
function resumed. Her diet was reverted to NPO during post-op
evaluation for dark brown emesis with clots. Once her condition
stabilized, she was advanced to regular food. She has been
tolerating a regular diet without complaints of nausea and/or
vomiting prior to discharge.
.
ELIM:She had a foley catheter inserted intra-op. The catheter
was removed, and she was able to urinate without difficulty. She
reports passing flatus, but has not had a bowel movement since
surgery.
.
PAIN:Her pain was managed with an IV PCA post-op. She was
advanced to oral Percocet once tolerating oral fluids. She
reports her pain is well tolerated. She will be discharged with
a 2 week supply of Percocet, and colace to prevent constipation.
