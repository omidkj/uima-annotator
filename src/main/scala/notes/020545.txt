Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia s/p cardiac cath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Hemodialysis
TUnnelled line placment

History of Present Illness:
59 y.o. Female presented to [**Hospital1 **] ER on day of admission w/
SOB, no chest pain. RA sat noted to be 86%, RR 36. EKG shows
borderline STE inferiorly, inferior Q waves, TWI in inferior and
lateral leads. She was given ASA, lasix 120 mg IV and solumedrol
and started on heparin and nitro gtt. Labs there notable for K
5.1, BUN 114, Crn 4.4, hct 28.8, CK 202, trop I 0.2, elev
transaminases, nl t bil, nl ocags, nl alb. tx'd to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cath. Of note pt fell recently and hurt L arm.

Got cath with following findings
  1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system
with three vessel coronary artery disease. The long LMCA had no
hemodynamically significant flow limiting lesions. The
attentuated LAD
had diffuse moderate disease with high grade disease in the
branch
vessels. The small attenuated LCX had diffuse moderate disease.
The RCA had an 80% proximal lesion with a 95% mid vessel
stenosis with thrombus. The PDA and PL branches had high grade
diffuse disease with left to right collaterals from the LAD.
  2. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated severely elevated right
sided
(mean RA 14 mmHg), pulmonary (mean PA 46 mmHg), and left sided
pressures (mean PCWP 33 mmHg). The cardiac index was normal (2.9
l/min/m2).
  3. Left ventriculography was deferred for severe renal
insufficiency.
  4. The right femoral arteriotomy was closed successfully with
angioseal.
  5. ABG in cath lab 7.16/55/70.

She was transferred to CCU post cath on 100% NRB, satting 95% on
natrecor. ABG in cath lab 7.16/55/70. Given elevated wedge,
hypoxia, and severe CHF, Renal was consulted. She was given 200
IV lasix and 500 IV diamox with little response. R femoral
Quinton catheter was placed. She was dialyzed with 2.5 kg UF.
She also was placed on Bipap for oxygenation. Repeat ABG on
Bipap and during dialysis was 7.31/41/94. She was ordered to get
blood transfusion, given her anemia, during dialysis but the
blood was not ready in time. She was taken off bipap and her
sats were 95% on 70%NRB and weaned to nasal cannula over the
first night of admission.

Labs: **creat 4.3, trop .2, ck 200's, bnp 2,320, h/h 9.5/28.8,

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**5-20**]:

[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] size. EF 35%. No ASD. LV wall thickness/ cavity size nl.
LV systolic function moderately depressed w/mild global HK and
near AK of inferior and infero-lateral walls. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] RV chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) mildly
thickened, no AS/ AR.
moderate (2+) MR. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Small to moderate sized pericardial effusion mostly localized
anterior to the RA. no tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo female w/ hx DMII, chronic kidney disease, baseline creat
4.0, hx " silent MI" w/ EF 30%, admitted s/p cath for borderline
STE in inferior leads, elevated PCWP 33, w/ distal occlusion of
RCA s/p stent, metabolic acidosis, with decompensated CHF
requiring dialysis.

1. CHF: Unclear exacerbating factor. Likely related to dietary
indiscretion and ARF on CRF with sytolic and diasotolic
dysfuncion. SHe responded well to hemodialysis with
approximately 2.5 liters taken off over 3 sessions. Pt had HD
again on [**5-24**] after tunneled line was placed at which time 1kg
was taken off. Last HD(ultrafiltration) prior to d/c was on [**5-25**]
at which time she had fluid removed (1.7 kg) [**1-20**] to O2 sats in
low 90's. O2 sats improved after dialysis. During admission she
was started on regimen of afterload reduction with isordil and
hydralazine. She will be discharged on Imdur, 90mg QD and
hydralazine, 25mg q6hr. We resumed her coreg at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
After she is stable on regular outpt hemodialysis, she should be
switched to an ACEI. Echo showed EF 35% during admission.
.
2. Hypoxia: Likely secondary to CHF and pulmonary edema. She had
no clear infiltrate on CXR. Her hypoxia improved after
hemodialysis.  She was sating 95-98% on room air at time of
discharge.
.
3. ACS: She may have had a small STEMI. Her CK's were flat, but
troponin of 0.22-0.4. She is S/P RCA stent at cath. She was
maintained on her coreg, ASA and plavix and lipitor were started
during admission. She was started on hydralazine and imdur. She
will benefit from and ACEI or [**Last Name (un) **] for afterload reduction and
remodeling after HD is started on outpt basis, and then can
discontinue hydralazine and imdur.
.
4. Hypertension: Her BP was quite labile at times. She was
treated with Carvedilol, isosorbide dinitrate. We held norvasc
given more benefit from hydral/nitrate and afterload reduction.
As above, she will be discharged on hydralalzine and imdur.
.
5. ARF: SHe is requiring HD at this point. Per her outpt
neprhologist she did require HD in past for CHF but recvoered
her kidney function and creatinine went down to 3.5. It appears
that she will need chronic dialysis to keep her euvolemic.
Renal ultrasound was negative for obstruction, urine eos neg,
u/a neg. Spoke to her nephrologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 26271**]
and plans underway for her to get out patient dialy
