Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain radiating to back with a pulsatile
abdominal mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EVAR AAA


History of Present Illness:
87 yo M with known 9cm AAA had previously refused Tx presented
on
[**9-4**] with abdominal pain radiating to back with a pulsatile
abdominal mass.  Patient presented to [**Hospital **] hospital where C-
CT showed leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm with maximum AP and
transverse Diameter of 9.6 and 9cm respectively.  Pt was med
flighted to [**Hospital1 18**] where he was met in the ED and found to have
stable vital signs and mentating well. He was immediately taken
for a CTA which showed:
1. Leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm with extensive stranding in
the
retroperitoneum adjacent to the aneurysm compatible with
hematoma. No active
extravasation of contrast is seen. Reduced flow within the
abdominal aorta as
evidenced by dilatation of the right atrium and ventricle and
absence of
intravenous contrast within the aorta distal to the aneurysm on
media
postcontrast images.
2. Extensive colonic diverticula without evidence for acute
diverticulitis.
3. Subcentimeter lesion in the left hepatic lobe incompletely
characterized
on this study.
4. Adequate opacification of the renal arteries, SMA and celiac
artery. The
[**Female First Name (un) 899**] is not clearly visualized.
5. Coronary artery and aortic valvular calcifications

Final Report
INDICATION: 87-year-old male with AAA.
COMPARISONS: None.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were obtained from the lung bases
through the
pubic symphysis following administration of 130 ml of
intravenous Optiray
contrast. Delayed images through the abdomen were also acquired.

No pre-contrast images were obtained. Multiplanar
reconstructions were
performed.

CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Extensive calcifications are seen
within the
coronary arteries and aortic valve. The heart size appears
enlarged with
distention of the right atrium and ventricle consistent with
right heart
strain. A 1.1 x 0.8 cm hypodensity in the left hepatic lobe
(3:41) is
incompletely characterized. There is no biliary ductal
dilatation. The
gallbladder, spleen and adrenal glands appear normal. The
pancreas is
atrophic without mass. There are numerous colonic diverticula
without
evidence for acute diverticulitis. Small mesenteric and
retroperitoneal lymph nodes do not meet criteria for pathologic
enlargement.

There is an abdominal aortic aneurysm which originates
approximately 4.6 cm distal to the lower most right renal artery
and courses in length 14 cm to the bifurcation. The maximal
outside dimensions of the aortic aneurysm are 10.0 x 9.1 cm. The
aneurysm contains extensive intramural thrombus with
heterogeneous attenuation consistent with acute on chronic
components with a maximal internal luminal diameter of
approximately 5.6 x 5.1 cm (5:16). The wall of the aneurysm is
calcified with no definite break in the wall identified. There
is a moderate amount of stranding and intermediate attenuation
(45 [**Doctor Last Name **]) in the retroperitoneum adjacent to the aneurysm, which
does not show an increase of attenuation values on the delayed
images, compatible with periaortic hematoma. Findings are most
consistent with a leaking aneurysm with surrounding hematoma,
with no evidence of active extravasation. No dissection flap is
seen. The common iliac arteries are heavily calcified and
tortuous, measuring 1.1 cm on the right and 1.6 cm on the left.
A saccular aneurysm measuring 2 cm is noted within the proximal
right common iliac artery (5:41). Flow within the abdominal
aorta is reduced given that intravenous contrast is not seen
within the distal aorta on immediate postcontrast images. There
is adequate opacification of the celiac and superior mesenteric
artery. The inferior mesenteric artery is not visualized.
Bilateral renal arteries opacify appropriately with symmetric
enhancement of both kidneys. There are multiple renal
hypodensities, the largest consistent with cysts and others too
small to characterize. There is no free intraperitoneal air.

CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There are numerous sigmoid
diverticula without
evidence for acute diverticulitis. The distal ureters, urinary
bladder,
rectum, prostate and seminal vesicles are unremarkable. There is
no free
pelvic fluid or air. No inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy is
identified.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no osseous findings suspicious for
malignancy.

IMPRESSION:
1. Leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm with extensive stranding in
the
retroperitoneum adjacent to the aneurysm compatible with
hematoma. No active extravasation of contrast is seen. Reduced
flow within the abdominal aorta as evidenced by dilatation of
the right atrium and ventricle and absence of intravenous
contrast within the aorta distal to the aneurysm on media
postcontrast images.
2. Extensive colonic diverticula without evidence for acute
diverticulitis.
3. Subcentimeter lesion in the left hepatic lobe incompletely
characterized on this study.
4. Adequate opacification of the renal arteries, SMA and celiac
artery. The [**Female First Name (un) 899**] is not clearly visualized.
5. Coronary artery and aortic valvular calcifications.

Findings were reviewed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] the surgical staff
immediately upon completion of the study.
