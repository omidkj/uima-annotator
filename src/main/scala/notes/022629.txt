Brief Hospital Course:
Summary: 74yoF with history of wegener's granulomatosis with
recent admission for post-obstructive pneumonia, who was
re-admitted from rehab for asymptomatic hyperkalemia and EKG
changes
.
# Hyperkalemia: Felt to be most likely related to exogenous
potassium supplementation in the setting of acute kidney failure
(baseline 0.5-0.7, 1.1 on admission).  Her potassium normalized
after medications including insulin, kayexelate and Ca
gluconate. She was initially transferred to the MICU for EKG
changes (peaked T waves).  These changes remained stable and
present after her potassium had normalized for 24 hours, and she
was transferred to the floor, where she was subsequently
discharged to rehab without incident.
.
# Acute renal failure: Baseline Cr 0.5-0.7, admitted with Cr
1.1, improved with IV hydration. Possibly related to decreased
PO intake in setting of chronic loose stool.
.
# Transaminitis: Improved, likely related to voriconazole
therapy. U/s did raise possibility of parenchymal disease, so
this may warrant further outpatient work-up.
.
# Recent PNA and Aspergillous infection/COPD: Diagnosed with
presumed post-obstruction pneumonia recently on [**11-17**] on
vanco/zosyn/vori. Slated to finish Vanc/zosyn on [**12-2**] and
voriconazole on [**11-29**], and this course was continued this
admission
.
# Wegener's Granulomatosis: Last ANCA in house was negative. Her
prednisone dose during last admission was 20mg per rheumatology.
She came in on 30mg daily, and this was decreased back to 20mg
daily this admission
.
# Osteoporosis: We continued calcium/vitamin D
.
# Hypothyroidism: We continued home levothyroxine
.
# Depression/Anxiety: We continued home citalopram and ativan
=====
Transitional issues:
#) hyperkalemia: if potassium needs to be repleted, would do so
very judiciously given her hyperkalemia that required MICU
transfer.
.
#) EKG:  Her EKGs have persistently peaked T waves, and these T
waves were present on multiple EKGs well after potassium had
been corrected
.
#) Antibiotics:  Should complete the course previously set on
the last admission.  Vanc/zosyn to finish [**12-2**], and
voriconazole on [**11-29**].
.
#) Liver ultrasound:  Suggested the possibility of parenchymal
disease, which may suggest the need to be investigated further
as an outpatient.
