Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
Sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central venous catheter placement, [**2118-8-25**]

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 79yoM with chronic back pain, CHF, CAD, who presented to
ED with worsening back pain and was tranferred from the floor
for sepsis. Five days prior to [**Month/Day/Year **] patient received an
injection for worsening chronic back pain no longer responsive
to tylenol #4 at [**Location (un) 86**] Pain Clinic. Since then pain has
progressively worsened, especially on the left, and he felt warm
according to family. History was obtained via chart and family
as patient with depressed MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. They state
that he complained of HA in ED, but prior to that was
asymptomatic. No photophobia, neck stiffness, bowel or bladder
incontinence, sensory loss or muscle weakness. He ambulates on
his own at baseline. + constipation for 3 days, but no
complaints of abdominal pain, melena, hematochezia. Patient was
brought to ED by family for worsening back pain.
.
In ED they felt he had a cellulitis over lower spine and MRI
with contrast was obtained and there was no evidence of OM,
epidural abscess, or discitis. Pt was started on oxacillin out
of concern for cellulitis and received morphine for pain
control. Overnight the patient recieved a dose of unasyn for
further concern of cellulitis. This morning the patient was felt
to have an altered MS, HA, ?neck stiffness, and he was started
on vancomycin, cefepime, acyclovir, and ampicillin for presumed
meningitis. Blood cultures were obtained (not obtained in ED).
He was taken down for head CT, at which time his lactate came
back at 8. He was tachpnic and febrile to 101, and tranferred
emergently from radiology to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for sepsis.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], vitals were 101.9, 157/70, 109, 40, 96% on
2L NC. Patient was minimally communicative, saying 'help' often,
and grimicing in pain on palpation of abdomen and turning.
Family was present and history as above obtained. KUB
demonstrated dilated stomach but no dilated loops of bowel or
air fluid levels. ABG was 7.25/40/98. Left subclavian line was
placed and sepsis protocol initiated.


Past Medical History:
CHF
chronic back pain
CAD, CABG [**2113**]

Social History:
The patient does not use alcohol and does not have a smoking
history. He lives with his daughter and his wife. [**Name (NI) **] used to
work in maintenance. He is originally from the [**Last Name (un) 33854**]
Republic. Recently came to US in [**Month (only) 547**] to live/visit family. No
other recent travel.

Family History:
His brothers died of myocardial infarctions
at ages 63 and 66. He has a sister who had a coronary artery
bypass graft at age 73.


Physical Exam:
T 101.9, 109, 157/70, 40, 96% 2L NC
Agitated, moaning in pain, unable to verbally communicate d/t
depressed MS.
[**Name14 (STitle) 4459**]: PERRL, anicteric sclera, OM clear, no exudate, no LAD
Cardiac: RRR, NL S1 and S2, II/VI SEM at LUSB, no JVD
appreciated
Lungs: Mod wheezes bilaterally
Abd: Distended, not tense, TTP throughout with patient grimicing
and yelling out when palpated, low hypoactive BS. Rectal with nl
tone per ED resident.
Skin: No evidence of erythema or warmth along lumbar spine.
+bullae, 1cm, left of lumbar spine. Could not appreciate
paraspinal tenderness. + sacral edema. Skin color changes, but
no overt evidence of cellulitis.

Imaging:
[**2118-8-23**] MR without contrast:
Disc degeneration of L3-L4, L4-L5, L5-S1.Central disc bulge at
L5-S1. L5 facet joint DJD. Mod-severe central spinal stenosis at
L4-L5, L3-L4. No conus compression or lesion. Abnormal T2 singal
in left erector spinae muscle (infectious, traumatic,
neoplastic).
.
[**2118-8-25**] MRI (unsigned):
IMPRESSION:
1. Enlargement of the left spinal rectus muscle which
demonstrates abnormal increased T2 signal and enhancement. As
the fat planes are preserved, this is not consistent with an
abscess. These findings may be suggestive of myositis of the
patient has a prior history of trauma to this region, or
post-inflammatory process. Comparison with the patient's
previous MRI is recommended.
2. Degenerative disc disease as described above with most severe
spinal stenosis at L4-5.
3. No evidence of osteomyelitis or epidural abscess.
.
[**2118-8-25**]:
CT HEAD: No evidence of acute intracranial pathology including
no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
.
EKG: NSR, 0.5mm ST elevation in V1 and V2 with Jpoint elevation
in V3. No Q waves.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 79yoM with acute on chronic back pain, CAD, CHF, who was
tranferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for concern of sepsis.
.
1. Sepsis: Patient with severe sepsis, developing multisystem
organ failure with severe lactic acidosis and evidence of DIC
(elevated FDP), required intubation for respiratory failure
(ARDS vs. pneumonia vs. edema-less likely given patchy
distribution). No evidence of abscess on MRI of lower spine.
Only source of infection is blood cultures from [**8-25**] with 2/4
coag + staph. Abdominal source also possible given acute
abdomen, though this could also represent ischemic damage in the
setting of sepsis. UA negative. He was aggressively volume
resuscitated as well as treated with maximum dose levophed and
vasopressin to elevate blood pressure and elevate SVO2 per
sepsis protocol to maintain CVP 12-15 and MAP >60. He was placed
on a HCO3 gtt with additional HCO3 pushes in an effort to
elevate his pH, which continuted to fall as lactate continued to
rise during his hospital course. He was also started on Xigris
based on his APACHE score. Despite these measures his blood
pressure did not respond well as his pH fell to 7.27 then 7.03,
regardless of HCO3. His lactate continued to rise to 12.2. He
was treated empirically with ceftriaxone, vancomycin,
ampicillin, flagyl and acyclovir. He was designated CPR not
indicated on the evening of [**2118-8-25**] by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 217**]. The following day at 1355 he was noted to be
increasingly bradycardic with many missed or dropped beats and
rapidly became asystolic. He was assessed at 1400 and found to
lack have no heart sounds, breath sounds, corneal blink reflex,
oculocephalic reflex, withdrawl to pain in any extremity or
grimace to sternal rub, therefore he was pronounced deceased.
His family was at the bedside and they consented for an autopsy.

.
2 Abdominal Pain - KUB with dilated stomach but no overt
evidence of SBO, lavage with frank blood so pantoprazole was
started for ulcer protection. NG tube was left in place to
decompress the stomach but further imaging was not possible
prior to death.
.
3 H/O CAD - Patient with elevated CK and mildly elevated
troponin but normal CK-MB and MBI. Troponin trended up during
hospital course from 0.09 to 0.3 to 0.6 but in the setting of
severe sepsis with multisystem organ failure and DIC. He was
maintained on Aspirin and lipitor during this time but
betablockers and nitro were held in the setting of sever
hypotension refractory to vasopressors.
.
4 Elevated CK - Initially thought to be c/w traum
