Brief Hospital Course:
She underwent hemodialysis and then received rituximab. She was
plasmapheresed with ffp replacement then she received IVIG and
prograf per desensitization protocol. She was taken to the OR on
[**9-24**] for living related renal transplant placed on the right
side by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] without complications. A JP was
placed. She received a reduced dose of ATG 50mg for wbc of 1.8
and solumedrol induction. EBL was 200cc. She produced urine
ranging between 250-500cc per hour. Preop creatinine was 8.1.
The creatinine trended down to 1.7 on pod 9. She did experience
right lateral leg numbness which was slightly swollen. A non-in
     She received plasmapheresis x4 on subsequent days. ATG was
given x4. Prograf was continued at 2mg [**Hospital1 **] for level in the
11-12 range. Imuran was started at 50mg qd then increased to
75mg qd when wbc increased. Prednisone was tapered per protocol
then she was maintained on 25mg qd. Her platelet count was low
(62-51)postop.She received 1 unit PRBC on [**9-28**] for hct of 21.7.
Nephrology followed throughout this hospitalization making
recommendations which included increasing lopressor for elevated
BP. [**Last Name (un) **] followed for glucoses in the 113-168 range secondary
to steroids. Sliding scale insulin was recommended. On [**9-29**] she
had a temperature of 101.5. She was started on vanco and zosyn.
Her cline was changed over a wire without complications. Urine
culture was positive for 10-100,000 col enterococcus sensititive
to vanco. She received 4 days of iv vanco and zosyn then this
was switched to augmentin x2 days. A repeat urine culture was
negative.
     A repeat crossmatch was sent and this was negative.
     On [**9-29**], she complained of diarrhea. Stool was sent x 3 for
c.diff. These samples were negative.  The JP was removed. She
had a small amount of drainage from this site. On pod 7 she c/o
pain in RLQ. An u/s demonstrated a fluid collection which was
successfully aspirated under u/s and a catheter was placed. This
fluid was sent for Approximately 130 cc of clear yellow fluid
with the appearance of urine, was removed. Culture was negative
for growth. Fluid from this drain was sent for creatinine which
was 1.4-1.8. Three days later a rpt u/s revealed no interval
change in the appearance of the arterial waveforms within the
transplanted kidney. The resistive indices range from 0.73 to
0.8. A fluid collection adjacent and deep to the transplanted
kidney was seen, measuring 7.0 x 5.6 x 5.4 cm. This was slightly
smaller. A pigtail drain was left in place. Initially, the
patient was to d/c home at this time with Pigtail drain in place
and finish Augmentin course.  Creat at that time was 1.7. Renal
U/S shoewed good blood flow to the graft. On Post-op day 11 a
biopsy was performed that showed Glomerular and vascular changes
suggestive of thrombotic microangiopathy and patient was kept
for further hospitalization. Creatinine 3.8 at that time.
Patient received 2 more rounds of plasmapheresis and IVIG for a
total of 6 post transplant.
Abdominal wound from transplant was opened for drainage on [**10-9**].
Wound packed with NS wet to dry with good wound healing.
In spite of wound healing issues, immunosuppression changed from
Prograf to Rapamune for concern of Prograf toxicity to the
allograft.
On [**10-12**] patient was having some abdominal pain CT showed that
the pigtail drain appeared to be located laterally within the
collection. Patient underwent successful lysis of presumed
loculations within the perirenal transplant fluid collection,
with aspiration of all visible fluid in this collection. Fluid
analysis shows a creatinine content of 2.0 mg/dL. Gram stain and
culture were no growth.
Absolute CD3on [**10-13**] was 234. Patient continued to receive ATG.
Nadir of 0 on [**10-23**].
On [**10-14**] another allograft biopsy was performed. This was
consistent with acute cellular rejection, Banff Category 3. C4d
staining of peritubular capillaries was negative.
Following biopsy, the hematocrit was noted to have dropped to
19%, CT showed new subcapsular hematoma surrounding the
transplant kidney and extending into the right paracolic gutter.
Transfused with 2 units PRBCs with appropriate response.
On [**10-19**] patient spiked temp to 101.6. Blood cultures were
negative, however, she did grow Vanco resistant Enterococcus in
the urine. This was covered with Linezolid, continued on Zosyn,
Vanco d/c'd. ID was consulted and recommended Daptomycin. All
other antibiotics stopped at this time.
Blood pressure more elevated at this time, Metoprolol increased
to 100 mg TID.
Immunosuppresion: changed to Myfortic, Imuran d/c'd on [**10-22**]
Patient continued to improve and remained afebrile until
discharge home on [**10-28**].
Patient did have complaint of Right hip pain. X-ray on [**10-26**]:
Sclerosis and flattening suggestive of avascular necrosis of the
femoral head. Long-term steroid therapy may be the etiology.
Pigtail drain was left in to drainage.
Immunosuppression home course is Rapamycin 8 QD, Myfortic 360
[**Hospital1 **] and Pred 20
Final Absolute CD3 count on discharge was 57.
[**Last Name (un) **] followed blood sugars all during hospitalization, patient
on Lantus only for awhile and then c
