CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
80 year old woman with
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate effusion
TWO-VIEW CHEST:

COMPARISON: [**2117-5-22**].

INDICATION: Pleural effusion.

Patient is status post recent median sternotomy and coronary
artery bypass surgery. Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
stable in the postoperative period. There is improving bibasilar
atelectasis. Small pleural effusions are again demonstrated,
with apparent slight increase in the left pleural effusion,
although positional differences slightly limit comparison. A
tiny retrosternal gas collection on lateral radiograph, likely a
normal postoperative finding given the recent surgery.

IMPRESSION: Improving bibasilar atelectasis. Small pleural
effusions with possible slight increase on the left.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
LA/LAA or the
RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. No ASD by 2D or
color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Normal regional LV systolic function.
Overall normal LVEF
(>55%). Transmitral Doppler and TVI c/w Grade I (mild) LV
diastolic
dysfunction.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic
arch. Normal
descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.


AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Severe
mitral
annular calcification. No MS. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.


PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the

anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. The patient was
under general
anesthesia throughout the procedure. The patient appears to be
in sinus
the patient.

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size
and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade I
(mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch.
There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened.
There is severe mitral annular calcification. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
POST-BYPASS:
Preserved biventricular systolic function. LVEF 60%.
Trivial MR and trivial TR.
