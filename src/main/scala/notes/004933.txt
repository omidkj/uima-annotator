complete heart block

pacemaker placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 56272**] is a 51M w/ hx of AS (unknown severity), HTN,
hypothyroidism, s/p Hodgkin's treatment w/ extensive radiation
therapy to chest at age of 4, who presents intubated from
outside hospital with bradycardia.

The patient fell yesterday approximately 10pm, felt dizzy
previously, struck head and was evaluated by outside hospital
with CAT scan which was reportedly negative, reported to be a
concussion, and went home to rest. At the time that the patient
struck head, he reportedly "turned blue" and was subsequently
numb on his right side. Later in the day, the patient felt
faint, and began to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] EMS was called and the patient
returned to the same OSH ER.  He was found to be hypotensive and
bradycardic at a rate in 30s-40s, thought to be a ventricular
escape rhythm. The patient was given atropine and epinephrine
with no change in HR or BP. Labs subsequently revealed WBC:
14.7, HCT: 46.2, Plt: 237, INR: 1.3, K: 6.9, BUN:27, Cr:2.8,
Tn-I: 0.05. The pateint's baseline Cr is unknown. Patient was
started on a dobutamine drip, transferred here for further
evaluation.

Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED the patient was in complete heart
block with narrow escape rhythm at approx 35-40 bpm.  His
pressures were 100-110 on 5 of dopamine drip.  Repeat K
demonstrated K of 6.0.  He was given insulin and calcium
gluconate.   Placement of temporary pacing wire deferred
secondary to poor access (secondary to radiation) and renal
failure. The patient had a FAST exam that was negative.  CXR
demonstrated a large globular heart.  Cspine showed no acute
abnormality and CT head non-con demonstrated no acute
intracranial abnormality. A femoral triple lumen central line
was placed.  He received 3L IVF in the Emergency Department.
Repeat labs demonstrated K of 4.6, Cr of 2.5 and lactate of 6.4.

On review of systems (per sister [**Location (un) **], the patient had symptoms
of dyspnea and dyspnea on exertion for approximately 6-9 months.
 The sister knew no other symptoms.  Reportedly he had been
evaluated for AVR, and was denied both open and transcutaneous
minimally invasive procedures.

The patient was intubated upon arrival to the CCU, history was
obtained from sister [**Name (NI) **] and the medical record.  Upon arrival
to CCU, patient's rate 25-30, with SBP 80s-90s.  SBP originally
in 80s-90s, decreased to 70s-80s.  Dopamine transiently
increased in an attempt to elevated SBP. Transcutaneous pacing
was initiated.  Increased voltage of pacing to facilitate
capture.  SBP increased to 150s with capture of external pacing.
 Decreased dopamine and increased sedation (fentanyl, midazolam
gtts).

Studies:
CXR ([**2149-6-10**]): IMPRESSION:  Moderate pulmonary edema.

ECHO ([**2149-6-10**]):
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are top normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with basal anteroseptal akinesis and inferoseptal
hypokinesis (overall left ventricular ejection fraction ?45-50%
but views are suboptimal for assessment of sytolic function).
Cannot exclude additonal wall motion abnormalities. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal free
wall function. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**1-27**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe mitral annular
calcification. There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean
gradient 3 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Mild to
moderate ([**1-27**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve
prosthesis is not well seen. There is a small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

CT C-spine non-con ([**2149-6-10**]):
IMPRESSION:
1.  No fracture or subluxation.
2.  Likely status post thyroidectomy.

CT head non-con ([**2149-6-10**]):
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial process.

CXR ([**2149-6-12**]):
Transvenous right atrial lead curls anteriorly, its tip
projecting over the anterior wall of the mid portion of the
right atrium.  The right ventricular lead passes to the mid
portion of the right ventricle.  Pulmonary edema continues to
clear.  There is no pneumothorax or mediastinal widening and
small right pleural effusion is probably unrelated.  Severe
cardiomegaly has also improved.

Right upper extremity u/s ([**2149-6-13**]):
IMPRESSION:
1.  Acute thrombosis of the right basilic and cephalic
(superficial) veins.
2.  No evidence of right lower extremity DVT.  Axillary vein not
imaged, due to overlying bandage.

LE DOPPLER: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the right or
left leg
