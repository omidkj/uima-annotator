Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Re-do sternotomy , AVR (23mm porcine)


History of Present Illness:
This is a 61yo male s/p AVR in [**2162-6-17**] for aortic valve endocarditis. He has known bioprosthetic
aortic valve stenosis which has been followed by serial
echocardiograms. He has also had worsening symptomatology.
Current symptoms inlude dyspnea on exertion, fatigue and
peripheral edema. His most recent echocardiogram showed severe
aortic bioprosthetic stenosis with a peak of 74mmHg and a mean
of
44.mmHg. His aortic root and ascending aorta were dilated with
both measuring 4.3cm. Given the progression of his disease, he
has been referred for surgical management. Recent liver workup
by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] showed no evidence to suggest advanced chronic liver
disease. He was previously seen in [**Month (only) **] and [**Month (only) 359**] and now
presents for PATs. He has been cleared to proceed for redo
operation.

Pertinent Results:
Due to patient's history of gastric bypass surgery, only
mid-esophageal window images were obtained. No transgastric
views were attempted.

PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. No thrombus is seen in the
left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler.

Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free
wall contractility.

The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic
aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta.

A bioprosthetic aortic valve is present. The prosthetic aortic
valve leaflets are thickened. The transaortic gradient is higher
than expected for this type of prosthesis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.

Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at time of
study.

POST-CPB:
There is a porcine prosthetic valve in the aortic position. The
valve appears well seated with normal leaflet mobility. There is
no evidence of aortic stenosis or aortic insufficiency. There
are no paravalvular leaks.

Biventricular function is preserved. The tricuspid regurgitation
remains moderate. There is no evidence of aortic dissection.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the
operating room on [**2173-12-17**] where the patient underwent re-do
sternotomy AVR (23Porcine).  Overall the patient tolerated the
procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU
in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.
Cefazolin was used for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis.  POD 1
found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing
comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable on no inotropic or vasopressor support.
Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently diuresed
toward the preoperative weight. he developed a junctional rhythm
and hos lopressor dose was held then decreased without further
episode of junctional rhythm.  The patient was transferred to
the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest tubes and
pacing wires were discontinued without complication.  The
patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on POD #4 the patient was ambulating freely, the wound was
healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  The
patient was discharged to home in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
