Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Transferred from [**Hospital1 5042**] for management of
congestive heart failure

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 37-year-old
female with past medical history significant for non
Hodgkin's lymphoma in [**2115**] treated with chemotherapy and
radiation complicated by histoplasmosis, pulmonary fibrosis,
Aspergillus leading to left pneumonectomy in [**2122**].  The
patient also suffers from cardiomyopathy with last ejection
fraction measured in [**2124**] at 20%.  The patient is being
transferred for [**Hospital1 5042**] to [**Hospital6 2018**] Medical Intensive Care Unit for management of her
congestive heart failure.  The patient was admitted to
Medical Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital3 **] between [**1-6**] and [**1-31**] of this year for Pseudomonas pneumonia
requiring intubation for hypercapnic respiratory failure.  At
that time, the patient failed extubation and tracheostomy was
placed.  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital1 5042**] for pulmonary
weaning, however she had minimal success in coming off of the
respirator.  Per report, the patient's low systolic blood
pressures in the 80s to 90s lead to holding off her ACE
inhibitors as well as Lasix and gradual increase in her
weight.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Non Hodgkin's disease in [**2115**] treated with CHOP and XRT,
complicated by Histoplasma, ARDS, pulmonary fibrosis,
bronchiectasis, Aspergillus leading to left pneumonectomy in
[**2122**].  The patient's last pulmonary function tests are from
[**2130-9-18**] and revealed FVC of 0.6, FEV1 to FVC of 68 and
severely depressed total lung capacity indicating severe
mixed obstructive and restrictive disease.
2.  Tuberculosis in [**2121**]
3.  Status post splenectomy
4.  Anxiety and depression/insomnia
5.  Cardiomyopathy with ejection fraction of 20% in [**2124**]

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is single, lives with her mom.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.5??????, heart rate 114, blood
pressure 94/49, weight 152 pounds up from a dry weight of 112
to 114, respiratory rate 35, O2 saturation 100% on 50% O2
with pressure support of 15.
GENERAL:  The patient appeared as a chronically ill young
female in no apparent distress.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Her jugular veins were
distended to the angle of jaw.  Mucous membranes were moist.
Extraocular movements were intact.  Pupils were round and
reactive to light.
LUNGS:  Diffusely heard wheezes.
HEART:  Tachycardic, normal S1 and S2.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, distended, nontender, tympanic on the right
and dull on the left.  PEG tube in place leaking stomach
contents - food.
EXTREMITIES:  4+ edema to mid thigh bilaterally with good
distal pulses.

LABORATORY FINDINGS ON ADMISSION:  Sodium 130, phosphate 3.7,
chloride 85, bicarbonate 40, BUN 19, creatinine 0.6, glucose
96, calcium 7.8, magnesium 1.8.  Her white count was 8.8,
hematocrit 27.6, platelet count 429.  The differential on the
white count was 83 polys, 8 lymphocytes, 7 monocytes, 2
eosinophils.

IMAGING:  Her chest x-ray showed left sided whiteout, small
right pleural effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  During this hospitalization the patient's
issues included:

1.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  On admission, the patient was
severely fluid overloaded.  With aggressive Lasix diuresis,
the patient was able to return to her dry weight of
approximately 114 pounds.  The patient's blood pressure as
well as renal function tolerated diuresis well.  An
echocardiogram was obtained to confirm her cardiac function
and revealed LV function of approximately 30%.  Her right
ventricular cavity was markedly dilated.  There was severe
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.  The abnormal
septal motion was consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload.  The aortic valve appeared
structurally normal without aortic regurgitation.  Mitral
valve leaflets were mildly thickened.  There was mild 1+
mitral regurgitation.  There was severe 4+ tricuspid
regurgitation.  The main pulmonary artery was dilated with at
least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  At
discharge, the patient was on 160 mg of Lasix po and a low
dose of captopril for afterload reduction.  With these
medications, the patient was able to maintain systolic
pressure of around 80 without any signs of hypoperfusion.

2.  SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA:  The patient had a history
of supraventricular tachycardia.  During this
hospitalization, she had repetitive episodes of tachycardia
to 160 leading to slight shortness of breath and anxiety.
The patient was started on low dose Lopressor with
improvement in the frequency of the supraventricular
tachycardia episodes.  She was able to tolerate 12.5 mg of
Lopressor [**Hospital1 **] without significant change in her blood
pressure.

3.  VENT DEPENDENCE:  The patient had history of difficulty
weaning from respiratory in light of recent pneumonia.  As
her diuresis progressed, the patient was able to decrease her
ventilatory support.  Over the last four days prior to
admission, the patient was tolerating trach mask trials of
three hours and pressure support of [**4-22**] during the day.  At
night, the patient preferred to be rested on pressure control
ventilation set at FIO2 of 40%, PEEP of 5 and a driving
pressure of 20.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  During this hospitalization, the
patient had two gastrointestinal issues.  Issue #1 revolved
around her leaking G-tube.  Surgery was consulted and was
able to replace the tube with a larger caliber tube.
However, the patient persisted with slightly increased
leaking around the G-tube.  Her second issue was
constipation.  She required very aggressive bowel routine
including magnesium citrate and milk of molasses to maintain
regular bowel movements.

5.  ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND INSOMNIA:  During this
hospitalization, the patient initially had problems sleeping
and appeared to be very anxious.  Psychiatry consultation was
obtained and with their recommendation her medications were
changed to Remeron and Risperdal in addition to prn po
Ativan.  In addition, the patient remained on Haldol.  By the
end of the hospitalization, she reported improvement in her
insomnia.

6.  PROPHYLAXIS:  During this hospitalization, the patient
was maintained on subcutaneous heparin and Protonix.

7.  FREQUENT BLOOD LOSS:  A PICC line was placed on [**3-9**].

8.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  During this hospitalization, the
patient remained on percussions for prior Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.  She remained
mostly afebrile with one episode of low grade temperatures to
100.4??????.  The urine cultures from that day grew probable
Enterococcus.  The patient was not treated with antibiotics
with good resolution of low grade fever following change of
the Foley.  While in the hospital, the patient was started on
her inhaled tobramycin for history of Pseudomonas pneumonia.
On the date of discharge, she was on day #5 out of #21 for
the therapy.
