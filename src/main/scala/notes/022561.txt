Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
Transferred from OSH for cardiac catheterization and ICD
placement s/p VF arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pRBC blood transfusion
Cardiac catheterization
ICD placement

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 59 yr old male with PMHx of CAD s/p prior MI and
stents placed 5 years ago transferred from LGH s/p VF arrest.
Patient arrested on [**2134-11-9**] while at work driving a fork lift.
Fork lift crashed into wall, although pt did not have any
traumatic injury from that.  Shocked in the field x 3 by an AED
at his workplace.  He was down for almost 8 minutes.  He was
sent to LGH and found to have decorticate posturing by ER MD.
EKG on arrival was reviewed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at LGH and it was not
felt that pt had an STEMI. (0.5mm STE in (1 and AVF).  He was
intubated and underwent Artic Sun cooling protocol.  He was
extubated x 3 days.  Since rewarming, he was found to be
neurologically intact.  ECHO showed EF 30% with RV hypokinesis.
He was also hypoxic with concern for COPD flare vs CHF
exacerbation.  He was treated with nebs, PO steroids as well as
lasix.  Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath to r/o CAD and
subsequent ICD placement.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient was hemodynamically stable.  He was
admitted to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 but was found to be hypotensive to 60s.  This
initially responded well to fluids but he then experienced
another hypotensive episode to the 70s.  The patient denied
chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or lightheadedness.
No syncopal events occurred.  He also has occasional episodes of
hypoxia down the the 80s but denies shortness of breath.  He is
currently on IV heparin and IV amiodarone.  He is being
transferred to the CCU for closer monitoring.
.
He is currently endorsing left hip pain, LLQ pain.  This started
last night.  He is lightheaded when sitting up.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CTA-Torso [**11-16**]:
1. Massive left-sided retroperitoneal hematoma involving the
left pararenal
spaces, with intramuscular component in left psoas, iliopsoas,
iliacus and
proximal anterior thigh compartment. There is suggestion of
active bleeding
within the left psoas muscle. Small right psoas hematoma also
present.

2. Multifocal pulmonary opacity with severe emphysema. In
conjunction with
the regions of bronchial wall thickening and impaction, the
lower lobe
opacities are likely infectious (possibly aspiration related)
while the
additional opacities may relate to superimposed
alveolar/interstitial edema,
hemorrhage, or additional sites of infection. Small left simple
pleural
effusion.

3. Atherosclerotic disease involving the coronary circulation,
aorta and
suggestion of high-grade focal stenosis involving the proximal
right renal
artery.

4. Abnormal thick-walled appearing sigmoid colon in conjunction
with
moderate-to-severe diverticulosis. While this may relate to
underlying
sequelae of acute or chronic diverticulitis, the lumen appears
irregular and a
colonoscopy or follow up CT is recommended when feasible to
exclude underlying
neoplasm.

5. No findings of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism.
Mild-to-moderate
amount of ascites noted within the abdomen and pelvis.

TTE [**2134-11-17**]:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Diastolic function could not be assessed. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a prominent fat pad.

Cardiac Cath [**2134-11-18**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated insignificant coronary artery disease.  The LMCA
was free
of angiographically apparent disease.  The LAD had a 20-30%
stenosis in
the mid vessel.  The LCx had a 40-50% st
