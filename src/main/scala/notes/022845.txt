Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH for MI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with no intervention


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 60205**] is a 75 y.o man with hx of CAD with CABG [**11/2104**]
(LIMA-LAD, SVG-PLV, SVG-OM), LM BMS in [**2-/2106**] transferred to the
CCU from [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital for hypotension and decreased LVEF
following surgery for large colon mass on [**2107-6-24**].
The patient was in his USOH until about 4 weeks prior to
presentation when he started having constipation. He was
admitted to OSH on [**2107-6-18**] for acutely worsening abdominal pain
on the background of constipation. He underwent colonoscopy
which showed intussusception and fungating cecal mass with
biopsies showing invasive adenoCa. He underwent right
hemicolectomy on Friday [**6-24**]. Pathology report is pending at
this time. Pre-surgery he was given cardiac clearance after
having a stress test that showed only inferior scarring and an
ECHO with EF of 50%. He was extubated post operatively, but low
SaO2 to the 80's post extubation despite NRB led to reintubation
and transfer to the PACU. Per report he was extubated >1 day
later.
Pst-operatively, on [**6-25**] he developed hypotension requiring
Levophed gtt over the weekend which was weaned off the night
prior to transfer. Troponin I was noted to rise from 0.02 on
[**6-24**] to 2.28 on [**6-25**], then 1.77 on [**6-25**], with down trends q 8
hrs to 1.45, 1.21, and 0.55. A TTE was read as reduced LVEF to
25%, with mid/distal anterior wall akinesis, and inferior wall
akinesis/scarring. LV apex documented as akinetic as well with
mild impairment of the RV iwth free wall hypokinesis. Compared
to his [**6-21**] echo, the only read was mild concentric LVH, LVEF of
about 54%, with inferior wall akinesis/scarring/inferolateral
wall hypokinesis. He was started on aspirin 325 mg and heparin
gtt on [**6-25**] following the echo results. The following day, [**6-26**]
he was weaned off pressors and he was given another unit of
pRBCs with good UOP.
Patient also noted to be somewhat confused at OSH attributed to
operative sedation. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management of presumed peri-operative MI.
On arrival to the CCU, patient is alert and interactive. He
complains of severe pain in his right leg, behind the calf and
in the knee. The knee is swollen and warm, which his wife notes
is relatively new but has happened before. Has numbness in lower
extremities that is chronic. Denies any chest pain, SOB, nausea,
vomiting, or diarrhea. Has not eaten since surgery but is
passing gas. No abdominal pain. No new rashes. No headaches or
visual changes. Denies any history of alcohol withdrawal
seizures. He denies chest pain, SOB.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, recent fevers,
chills or rigors.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Discharge LabS:

Imaging:
Ultrasound right leg [**2107-6-27**]: Limited assessment of the right
posterior tibial and peroneal calf veins.  Otherwise no deep
venous thrombosis noted in the right lower extremity.

CXR [**2107-6-27**]: FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph,
the patient has received a
new right internal jugular vein catheter.  The tip of the
catheter projects
over the lower SVC.  There is no evidence of complications,
notably no
pneumothorax.  An increase in density of the right lung base is
likely caused
by patient rotation.  Moderate cardiomegaly.  Sternal wires are
unchanged and
intact.

CARDIAC CATH [**6-29**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective native coronary angiography in this right dominant
system
demonstrated 3 vessel coroanry artery disease.  The LMCA had a
patent
stent into the proximal LAD.  The LAD had a 60% lesion in the
mid
segment.  The LCX had an 80% lesion in the proximal se
