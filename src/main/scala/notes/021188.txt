[**2122-11-25**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system
demonstrated  three-vessel and LMCA disease. The LMCA had a 60%
ostial stenosis  followed by an ectatic segment. The LAD had a
highly ulcerated ostial 70% stenosis, an 80% proximal steniosis,
a 99% mid-vessel stenosis and a 99% stenosis in the first
diagonal branch. The LCx had a 60% proximal stenosis and was
totally occluded after a large first obtuse marginal branch. The
RCA had a 50% mid-vessel stenosis, 40% distal stenosis and a 60%
origin stenosis in the PDA. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics
revealed mild systemic arterial
hypertension, with an SBP of 159 mm Hg.
[**2122-11-26**] CArotid Ultrasound:
Right ICA stenosis <40% . Left ICA with no stenosis .
[**2122-11-27**] Intraop TEE:
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrium
is elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen
in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body
of the right atrium/right atrial appendage. A patent foramen
ovale is present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial
septum is seen at rest. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). The
right ventricle displays normal free wall contractility. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. POST BYPASS Normal
biventricular systolic function with a left ventricular ejection
fraction of 55%. No significant change in valvular function. The
thoracic aorta is intact after decannulation. The PFO flow
remains.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13170**] was admitted under cardiology and underwent cardiac
catheterization which revealed severe three vessel coronary
artery disease. Based upon the results, cardiac surgery was
consulted and routine preoperative evaluation was performed.
Workup was essentially unremarkable and he was cleared for
surgery. On [**11-27**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed coronary artery
bypass grafting surgery. For surgical details, please see
operative note. Following surgery, he was brought to the CVICU
for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. He
maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on
postoperative day one. He initially required aggressive diuresis
with intravenous Lasix. Given his mildly depressed left
ventricular function, heart failure therapy was optimized.
Swallow evaluation was performed due to difficulty swallowing
pills. There were no findings of aspiration, and his diet was
advanced.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed per cardiac
surgery protocol without complication. He remained mostly in a
normal sinus with a very brief episode of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation. Occasional PAC's were noted. He otherwise
continued to make clinical improvements with diuresis and was
eventually cleared for discharge to home on postoperative day
six. At discharge, surgical incisions were healing well and
incisional pain was controlled with Tylenol.
