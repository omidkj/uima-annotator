History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 88628**] is a 55 year old man recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] with
acute alcoholic hepatitis and found to be cirrhotic. His course
was complicated by hepatic encephalopathy and hepatorenal
syndrome. He was discharged to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] rehab two weeks ago. Pt
reports that he was improving and was about to be discharged
home from rehab, but over past week has been noticing that his
abdomen has becoming more and more distended. He has also been
gaining weight but does not know exactly how much. Pt reports
that his appetite has been decreasing over past week. Two days
ago he began to experience abdominal pain, which slowly
progressed until last night when it reached an [**6-29**]. Pain was
described as a stabbing sensation in the midline of abdomen,
nonradiating. Pt denies any fever or chills, nausea, vomitting
or change in bowel habits. No dysuria or change in urination
frequency.
.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt was given a paracentesis which did not show infection
and U/S of abdomen, which revealed decreased flow in portal
system.
.
On floor pt's vitals were stable, reports that abdominal pain
has been improved.
.

Studies:

[**2185-6-30**] RUQ Ultrasound: 1. No flow detected within the main,
left, and right portal vein which can be due to thrombosis or
extremely slow flow. Contrast-enhanced CT or MR is recommended
for further evaluation. This was discussed by phone with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 88629**] at 4:15 pm, [**2185-6-30**]. 2. Chronic liver disease with
splenomegaly and moderate volume ascites. 3. Gallbladder wall
thickening likely due to underlying chronic liver disease. No
evidence of acute cholecystitis.

[**2185-7-1**] MRI abdomen: 1. The central portal veins are patent with
appropriate direction of flow. 2. Moderate ascites. 3. Nodular
liver consistent with cirrhosis. No concerning focal liver
lesions.  4. Retroperitoneal varices, predominantly infrarenal.

[**2185-7-6**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia. The tracing is marred by
baseline artifact. There is prominent voltage in leads I and aVL
for left ventricular hypertrophy, more prominent as compared to
the previous tracing of [**2185-5-25**]. The rate has increased. There is
diffuse ST-T wave flattening. No diagnostic interim change.

[**2185-7-6**] CT abd/pelvis: 1. Diffuse dilation and air-fluid levels
of the entire small bowel with no transition point, most
consistent with ileus. Small bowel measures up to 4.8cm in
diameter, likely stable in size when compared to the KUB of
[**2185-7-4**], given differences in technique. 2. Moderate
amount of ascites, unchanged in amount since [**2185-7-1**]
abdominal MRI. Cirrhotic liver with varices, unchanged. 3.
Stable L1 vertebral body compression fracture.

[**2185-7-8**] TTE: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and excellent
global biventricular systolic function. Mitral regurgitation
with normal valve morphology.

[**2185-7-11**] UGI study/barium swallow: The study was extremely
limited due to the patient's immobility. With this limitation in
mind, barium was introduced into the esophagus and freed slowly
into the stomach. Once within the stomach, barium is seen
pooling and does not transit any further despite a one-hour wait
time. Again, this is likely consistent with the patient's known
diagnosis of ileus.  Evidence for distal obstruction was not
obtained due to patient's discomfort and the likelihood that the
transit of the barium into the small bowel would
take many hours.

[**2185-7-15**] Ascites cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

[**2185-7-23**] RUQ Ultrasound: 1. Large volume ascites. 2. No intra- or
extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. 3. Echogenic liver consistent
with fatty infiltration. More serious forms of liver
cirrhosis/fibrosis cannot be ruled out on the basis of this
study.

EGD [**7-8**]
Impression: An NG tube and Dubboff were indentified going in
from the esophagus all the way into the small bowel. Large
amount of liquid was seen in the 2nd portion that was aspirated
with the suction channel.
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

sigmoidoscopy [**7-8**]
Mildly dilated colon up to the splenic flexure
Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to splenic flexure

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 88628**] is a 55 year old man with a history of alcoholic
cirrhosis diagnosed in [**2185-5-20**] complicated by hepatic
encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome who presented with
abdominal pain from an ileus and had a prolonged hospitalization
complicated by respiratory distress requiring MICU transfer.
While in the MICU the patients condition continued to
decompensate despite supportive care. Multiple family meetings
took place between MICU team and patient's wife. The patient was
made DNR/DNI and moved to the general medical floor. On the
general medical floor, the patient continued to decline with a
calculated MELD consistently >40 and a rising bilirubin. Durring
family meeting between floor team and patient's wife, he was
made comfort measures only and he was enrolled into an in
hospital hospice program. He expired on [**21
