Brief Hospital Course:
25 M w/ [**Location (un) 849**]-Gastaut syndrome, chromosome 18q deletion w/
developmental delay, and medically refractory seizures transfer
from [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital for further management of fevers
and tachypnea, initially admitted to MICU [**2169-3-18**], transferred
to regular medicine floor [**2169-3-20**].  He was felt to have acute
bacterial pneumonia, and responded well to treatment with IV
vancomycin and aztreonam. He underwent PICC placement prior to
discharge, to enable completion of his antibiotics regimen at
home.

#. FEVERS- Imaging with CT Chest, high-grade fevers, cough and
dyspnea combined with leukocytosis were suggestive of acute
bacterial pneumonia. His infectious workup included: urine
culture with no growth, negative legionella antigen testing, no
evidence of influenza antigen, and blood cultures which
werewithout gorwth after four days at the time of discharge.  CT
abdomen was without evidence of intra-abdominal infection on CT.
 It was determined that the patient required broad coverage for
health-care associated pneumonia given residence at group home.
He was started on IV vancomycin and aztreonam given multiple
drug allergies.  A PICC line was placed for total antibiotic
duration of 10 days, and he will require 6 more days of therapy
after discharge.  He remained afebrile on the medical floor and
his white count trended down.  His cough improved and he was
stable on room air upon discharge, with a further improvement in
his pulmonary exam and level of alertness.

#. SEIZURES- Patient has history of medically refractory
seizures.  His home regimen entails: Keppra [**2158**
