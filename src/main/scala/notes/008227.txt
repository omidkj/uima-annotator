Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
[**2183-2-3**] CXR: Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is no focal
consolidation. No acute intrathoracic abnormality
.
[**2183-2-5**], CXR: Previous chest radiographs documented
hyperinflation likely due to emphysema or small airways
obstruction. Today's study shows normal lung volumes, although
there is distortion of the pulmonary vascular branching in the
upper lobes suggesting emphysema. Most significant is
interstitial abnormality at both lung bases, chronicity
indeterminate, that could be acute viral pneumonia or chronic
interstitial disease such as non-specific interstitial
pneumonitis. Of note, the heart is not enlarged. There is no
pulmonary vascular or mediastinal venous engorgement and no
pleural effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 68250**] is a 59 year old man with a history of left sided
hemiplegia secondary to CVA x2, HTN, significant tobacco use and
emphysema (COPD per ED report) who presented with difficulty
breathing. At presentation to the ED, he was additionally found
to be tachycardic and febrile.

# Dyspnea: The acute onset of shortness of breath is likely due
to underlying COPD exacerbated by influenza infection, possibly
with bacterial superinfection and worsened by anxiety.  At
presentation, there was minimal concern for PE given the lack of
risk factors; however, the patient has limited mobility at
baseline and was tachycardic at presentations.  Consistent with
a COPD exacerbation, wheezes were noted at presentation, and
again during periods of shortness of breath.  He was started on
steroids, azithromycin, and standing nebulizers.  The patient
had received a flu vaccine this year, but DFA for influenza was
sent given his poor respiratory status and fever, and returned
positive on HD2.  The morning of hospital day 2, Mr. [**Known lastname 68250**]
began suffering from worsening respiratory distress, and
required transfer to the intensive care unit for closer
observation.  Oseltamivir was given for influenza, as were
antibiotics for concern for a secondary bacterial infection
causing pneumo
