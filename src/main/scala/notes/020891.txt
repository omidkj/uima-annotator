Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
56-year-old female patient of Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 92952**] transferred from
[**Hospital3 417**] Hospital on [**5-18**] for evaluation of abdominal pain.
.
She is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2643**] for possible chronic
pancreatitis which has included evidence of pancreatic divisum
and borderline secretin test. Most recently, she was admitted to
OSH about 2 weeks ago for epigastric/RUQ comfort - unclear w/u
but pain eventually subsided and was d/c'd.  She represented to
OSH complaining of RUQ and epigastric pain, nausea and diarrhea
but no emesis. In OSH ED, she was found to be afebrile and
hemodymically stable with systolic blood pressure of 128/69.
Labs were unremarkable and pt received IVF, and anti-emetics and
pain control with narcotics. Ultimately, she was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
She reported that her epigastric/RUQ pain began about 3 days
prior to admission and is described as a tearing sensation like
someone was "sawing" through the abdomen. It does not radiate to
the back but instead localizes to the right side and sometimes
spreads in a band-like fashion. She also complains of  "the
runs" over the last 2 days but denies fevers/chills/EtOH. Her
last drink was a wine cooler 2 months ago and prior to that 1
year ago. Of note, she admits to sleeping from 8 pm to 2 pm and
waking up in pain. The pain is not worsened by eating. She does
admit to being very "gassey". Normally her pain is relieved with
small amounts of percocet but at this point progressed to where
she called 911 on the day of admission.
.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], pt noted to be afebrile with blood
pressure of 108/79 and hr in 60's. Labs notable for hypokalemia
to 3.2 and UA that revealed moderate LE with many WBC and
bacteria. Labs also revealed TSH of 14. The etiology of
abdominal pain was unclear but the plan was to check stool
studies, pain control and IVF and RUQ u/s to evaluate for
biliary process.
.
Shortly after admission to the medical floor she developed
hypotension to systolic 80's and bradycardia in the 50's. An ECG
obtained was sinus brady without ischemic changes. She had
recieved percocet and oxycontin but o/w no new meds. Pt was
slightly hypothermic to 96. ABG revealed 7.37/41/78 with lactate
of 0.9. Pt's mental status improved but still maintained
marginal systolic blood pressures - received 2L NS in boluses
without significant improvement in hemodynamics and marginal
urine output (15-20 cc urine per hour) so she was trasnfered to
the ICU for an overnight stay with rapid resolution of her
hypotension after fluid administration.
.
Further review of systems on arrival back on the medical floor -
Currently, pt complains of epigastric/ruq pain that does not
radiate. No fevers, chills. Mild dizziness and blurry vision. No
CP, reports DOE over last several days. No cough. Has history of
UTI's but doesn't feel like sx are c/w past infections.

Past Medical History:
1. abdominal pain for which w/u has involved:
ERCP which showed pancreas divisum and secretin test which was
negative for chronic pancreatitis. She last was studied with EUS
in [**2197**] that showed:
No evidence of chronic pancreatitis by EUS criteria.
Non-visualization of the main pancreatic duct in the pancreas
head consistent with pancreas divisum anatomy.
Dilated but otherwise unremarkable CBD.
Hyperechoic liver appearance suggestive of fatty liver
2. Status post open cholecystectomy
3. status post appendectomy
4. status post partial hysterectomy
5. status post several procedures for retention of urine.  The
patient currently uses self-catheterization.
6. ?lysis of adhesions
7. Asthma, now well controlled on singulaire.

Social History:
The patient is married, has 3 healthy children, is a nonsmoker
and is raising 2 of her grandchildren, ages 4 and 7. She
formerly was working in the Day Care Industry. She's looking
forward to her first airplane ride ever on an upcoming trip to
[**Country **] in [**Month (only) **].

Family History:
(per notes) Mother with diabetes, liver disease and congestive
heart failure.  Father with h/o DM and died of myocardial
infarction.  The patient has 9 female siblings and 1 male
sibling.  Among her siblings, there has been anxiety, diabetes,
uterine cancer, breast cancer, and atherosclerotic heart
disease.

Physical Exam:

Gen: chronically ill appearing female, lethargic but arousable,
oriented x 3
HEENT: mildly dry MM, anicteric sclera, OP clear, JVP at 8 at 45
degrees

Pulm: bilateral crackles about [**12-18**] from base, some clearing w/
cough
Abd: obese with multiple surgical incisions, soft NT,
nondistended tender to palpation on R upper and lower quadrants,
+ BS and epigastrum, no cvat
Ext: WWP no edema DP, radial 2+ bilaterally, strength 5/5 upper

Neuro: A+O x3, CN II -XII intact

Pertinent Results:
HIDA Scan - Normal transit time of less than 30 minutes.  No
evidence of CBD obstruction.
.
CHEST CT:
1.  Persistent bibasilar dependent atelectasis, with minimal
worsening in the right lower lobe since abdominal CT of one day
earlier.  Trace pleural
effusions are without change.
2.  Limited assessment of lung parenchyma due to expiratory
phase of
respiration.  No evidence of consolidation to suggest pneumonia,
but a subtle pulmonary abnormality would be difficult to detect
due to technical
limitations.
.
Labs were significant for a UA that revealed evidence of a UTI,
and slightly elevated transaminases and alkaline phosphatase.
.
CT CHEST:
1.  Persistent bibasilar dependent atelectasis, with minimal
worsening in the right lower lobe since abdominal CT of one day
earlier.  Trace pleural
effusions are without change.
2.  Limited assessment of lung parenchyma due to expiratory

respiration.  No evidence of consolidation to suggest pneumonia,
but a subtle pulmonary abnormality would be difficult to detect

limitations.
.
CT ABD:
1.  Distinct extrahepatic and mild central intrahepatic biliary
ductal
dilatation likely reflects sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.  No
choledocholithiasis.
2.  Fatty infiltration of the ventral portion of the pancreas,
as before.  No concerning pancreatic abnormality and no duct
dilation.  Pancreatic divisum seen better on prior MRI.
3.  Bladder augmentation with small bowel has the expected
appearance.
.
MRCP (limited):
Compared with the prior study, axial thin section T2-weighted
imaging shows progressive distention of the CBD from 7.7 mm in
[**2196**] to 1.4 cm on the current study.  In addition, the cystic
duct remnant seen posteriorly with respect to the CBD has also
increased from 7.7 mm to 10.7 mm.  While we see no fixed filling
defect, the study was not sufficient for ruling out filling
defects as the coronal MRCP images and other relevant imaging
was not completed.  Of incidental note has been a reduction in
size of the mid pole right renal cyst _____ now seen is two tiny
adjacent cysts laterally.  There is no hydronephrosis.  The
liver shows no evidence of solid mass lesion or distortion of
the intrahepatic vasculature.  The spleen, pancreas and adrenal
glands are normal. There is no evidence of significant
adenopathy or ascites.  Incidental note is made of small
effusions and some basilar atelectasis.
.
ERCP:
1. Evidence of previous sphincterotomy was present, with clear
bile draining into the duodenum. However, the sphincterotomy was
somewhat narrow in diameter.
2. Dilated bile ducts with tapered narrowing distally consistent
with ampullary stenosis.  Upon balloon sweep, this area was
resistant to the passage of the balloon, despite sphincterotomy.
3. An 8 mm Maxforce balloon was introduced for dilation into the
ampulla. Upon inflation, the wais
