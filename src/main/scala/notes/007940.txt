History of Present Illness:
46 yo M s/p renal transplant 17 yrs ago and ESRD on HD secondary
to focal glomerulosclerosis status post deceased donor kidney
transplantation on [**2163-5-13**] withgraft loss in [**2179-12-10**],

transposition of right upper arm arteriovenous fistula on
[**2180-11-8**]. He was found on the bathroom floor w/ blood on face
and in the mouth by family. Per EMS the patinet was
hypertensive, tachycardiac and intially unresponsive but MS

Imaging:
[**11-9**] KUB: NG tube in the stomach. No metal is seen in the
abdomen and pelvis
.
[**11-9**] CT Head/Neck:
1. Compression fractures of C4 and C5 with fracture lines
extending through the right transverse foramen of C5. Vascular
injury cannot be excluded at this level.
2. Grade I retrolisthesis of C4 on C5 with likely ligamentous
disruption is identified.
3. Fracture of the posterior-superior facet of C6.
.
[**11-9**]: CT Head: No intracranial hemorrhage or edema. No fracture
.
[**11-10**]: MRI/MRA head/neck:
BRAIN:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct. Small vessel disease
and chronic right-sided lacunar infarct. Soft tissue changes
right-sided maxillary, frontal, and ethmoid sinuses.
NECK
IMPRESSION: The right vertebral artery is small in size which
could be congenital variation as the vertebral artery is not
occluded or affected at the site of abnormality seen at C4-5
level. However, the MRA is limited by motion and for better
evaluation repeat MRA or CT angiography are recommended.
MRA OF THE HEAD:
IMPRESSION: Except for nonvisualization of distal right
vertebral artery, no other abnormalities are seen.
.
[**11-10**]: ECHO:
IMPRESSION: suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Dilated ascending aorta. No
structural cardiac cause of syncope identified.  Compared with
the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2179-12-23**], the seveirty
mitral regurgitation is reduced and a resting LVOT gradient is
no longer identified.
.
[**11-11**] MRI thoracic and lumbar spine:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence to support the presence of either
discitis or osteomyelitis within either the thoracic or lumbar
spine.
The visualized spinal cord, conus medullaris, and cauda equina
appear within normal limits. Within the limitations of coverage
of this study, there are no overt paraspinal abnormalities
discerned, either.
CONCLUSION: No evidence for discitis or osteomyelitis, or other
causes for spinal cord compression are seen.
.
[**11-11**]: EEG: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to bursts of
generalized mixed frequency slowing in the setting of a slow,
disorganized, poorly reactive background with the tracing also
notable
for triphasic waves. This constellation of findings is
consistent with
a moderate encephalopathy suggesting dysfunction of bilateral
subcortical or deep midline structures. Medications, metabolic
disturbance, infections, and anoxia are among the common causes
of
encephalopathy. There were no clearly focal or lateralized
features
although encephalopathic patterns can sometimes obscure focal
findings.
There were no clearly epileptiform features and no
electrographic
seizures were noted.
.
[**11-12**]: Prevertebral pathology:
A.  Prevertebral tissue:
Fibrovascular and adipose tissue with reactive vascular and
fibroblastic proliferation and mild chronic inflammation.
B.  C4 vertebral body:
1.  Fragments of reactive bone.
2.  Maturing trilineage hematopoiesis.
3.  No malignancy identified.
.
[**11-14**]: CT Sinus:
There is complete opacification of the right frontal sinus,
ethmoid air cells, and near complete opacification of the
sphenoid sinus and the right maxillary sinus. Moderate mucosal
thickening and retention cysts versus polyps of the left
maxillary sinus are seen. The OMUs are obstructed bilaterally.
High- density material is seen within the sphenoid sinus, which
may represent inspissated secretions versus fungal colonization
and less likely hemorrhage.
.
[**11-14**] CT Chest w contrast:
1. No central or segmental pulmonary emboli, however,
subsegmental emboli in the lower lobes cannot be excluded due to
atelectasis in the lower lobes.
2. Atelectasis and consolidation at the lung bases as described
above. Subcentimeter ground-glass opacity in the right middle
lobe is likely infectious or inflammatory.
3. Extensive atherosclerosis is present in the coronary arteries
4. Findings concerning for pulmonary artery hypertension.
.
[**11-14**] ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There
is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction
(measurement of gradient was technically suboptimal; ?peak of 11
mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is a no significant aortic stenosis (slightly increased
velocities due to left ventricular outflow gradient). No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean
gradient 4 mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial ef
