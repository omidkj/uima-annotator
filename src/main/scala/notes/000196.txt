Brief Hospital Course:
33 y/o female taken to the OR for symptomatic FNH with Dr
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. The patient was intubated without incident and
the procedure was initiated. The initial dissection was done and
the cut edge along the diaphragm was cauterized with the argon
beam. When the argon beam was turned off, anesthesia noted that
the patient did not return to normal sinus rhythm. Two
pre-cordial thumps were performed and the patient remained in
coarse VFib. Chest compressions were begun and epinephrine was
administered, this did not resolve the coarse VFib and
defibrillation was
accomplished with 360 joules and the patient returned to [**Location 213**]
sinus rhythm. Transthoracic echo was in place immediately and
demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary embolus or air embolus.
The intraoperative ultrasound and a Tru-Cut
biopsy of the mass lesion was done with the patient stable in
normal sinus rhythm. The resection was not completed that day
until the arrhythmia could be evaluated further. The liver was
again cauterized following the biopsy with no arrhythmias. The
abdomen was closed and she was returned to the PACU in stable
condition. She was monitored in the ICU for the next two days
and evaluated by the EPS service who could find no cause for the
VFib arrest. Echo showed No PFO or ASD with normal global and
regional biventricular systolic function.
She remained stable over the weekend and was taken back to the
OR on [**7-2**] for Left hepatic lobectomy and cholecystectomy
following review of the previous events and cardiology
clearance. The mass in the left lobe of the liver was removed
and cholecystectomy performed. Frozen section diagnosis was that
of focal nodular hyperplasia and the final pathology gave the
same diagnosis.
In the post op period, she was kept overnight in the ICU and
then transferred to the regular surgical floor the following
day.
She made excellent post op progress, was tolerating diet,
ambulating and had some return of bowel function and positive
flatus.
The JP drain remains in place. The incision was clean dry and
intact.
