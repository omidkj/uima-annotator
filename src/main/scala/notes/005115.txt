CXR: [**9-15**]
No evidence of CHF. A hazy opacity is noted in the left middle
lung zone, which likely represents an infiltrate/pneumonia given
the acuity of
its appearance.

CT head: [**9-21**]
IMPRESSION: New bilateral low-attenuation fluid collections
likely consistent
with chronic subdural hematomas, which were not present on the
previous CT
examination of [**2140-3-9**]. No evidence of more acute
intracranial bleed.
Symmetric mass effect with no evidence of midline shift. The
results of this

[**2140-9-21**], at approximately 5:30 PM.


NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: In the setting of infection,
these collections
may represent subdural effusions, which may be associated with
meningitis.
This possibility was discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 334**] at 11:10 am on
[**2140-9-22**].
