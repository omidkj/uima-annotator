Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2159**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain/nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
IR guided nephrostomy placement


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 78y/o WF w/a PMH significant for HTN and afib
who presented to an OSH w/ complaints of abd pain and nausea.
She was found to have a R ureteral stone w/ resultant
hydronephrosis and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ureteral stent
placement.  Her INR was found to be elevated when admitted and,
in the course of waiting for this to normalize, the patient
spiked a temperature to 105 and became hypotensive to the 70s.
She was bolused w/out effect and had little response to neo so
she was changed to levophed, given doses of cipro/vanco/gent and
transferred to the MICU for management.
.
In the MICU, urology was consulted and the patient received a R
nephrostomy tube.  However, tube placement was complicated by
renal artery puncture, afib, and increased dyspnea.  She was
intubated for this hypoxia and treated with lasix, metoprolol,
and diltiazem.  She was weaned off her pressors on [**1-1**] and
maintained her pressure w/out additional fluid boluses.  Her
sedation was weaned down and she was successfully extubated
shortly thereafter.  UCx grew proteus and her abx were changed
to levaquin alone and she remained afebrile for >24hr on this
regimen.  She continued to have trouble with afib and required a
dilt gtt on the day prior to call-out to control this rhythm but
she was transitioned to PO diltiazem and has been in NSR since
this time.  She was restarted on heparin prior to d/c as a
bridge to therapeutic coumadin anticoagulation.

Physical Exam:
140/66, 92, 18, 96% 2L
Gen: Pleasant obese female in NAD, in wrist restraints
HEENT: EOMI, PERRLA, MM dry, O/P clear
Lungs: clear anteriorly
CV: RRR, S1/S2 intact, 3/6 SEM at the USB
Abd: S/NT/ND, obese, +BS
Back: R nephrostomy tube in place and draining
Ext: brace on L wrist, 2+ LE edema
Neuro:CN 2-12 grossly intact, strength 5/5 bilaterally, AAO to
person, place (hospital in [**Location (un) 86**]), and time ([**2162-1-3**])

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2178-1-1**]: Right subclavian CV line overlies proximal SVC.
There is cardiomegaly and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta with
small bilateral pleural effusions consistent with CHF.  No
pneumothorax.  Overall appearances are essentially unchanged
since the prior film of [**2177-12-31**], apart from removal of
the ET tube.
.
CT Abd [**2177-12-29**]: 1) Moderate to severe right hydroureteronephrosis
with two obstructing distal right ureteral stones, 8 mm and 6 mm
respectively.
2) Probable obstructing 5mm right mid ureteral calculus causing
mild
hydroureter, though it is difficult to tell definitively if this
stone is
within or just medial to the right ureter on this CT without IV
contrast.
3) Small bilateral pleural effusions.
4) Coronary artery calcification.
.
ECHO [**2177-12-30**]: 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical  quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal LVEF>55%).
3. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular
systolic
function appears depressed.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is
mild aortic  valve stenosis.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
severe mitral
annular calcification. Trivial mitral regurgitation is present.

6. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 78 year old female with history of HTN, a.fib presenting
with ureteral stone, hydronephrosis, and urosepsis.  She
originally had hypotension and a leukocytosis in the ER and was
admitted to the MICU.  In the MICU, urology was consulted and
the patient received a R nephrostomy tube.  However, tube
placement was complicated by renal artery puncture, afib, and
increased dyspnea.  She was intubated for this hypoxia and
treated with lasix, metoprolol, and diltiazem.  She was weaned
off her pressors on [**1-1**] and maintained her pressure w/out
additional fluid boluses.  Her sedation was weaned down and she
was successfully extubated shortly thereafter.  UCx grew proteus
and her abx were changed to levaquin alone and she remained
afebrile for >24hr on this regimen.  She continued to have
trouble with afib and required a dilt gtt on the day prior to
call-out to control this rhythm but she was transitioned to PO
diltiazem on the day of call-out.
.
1. Sepsis - The patient was septic in the ER and her blood
cultures eventually grew proteus.  Her Bcx remained negative
throughout her stay.  She was treated with levaquin on the floor
and will complete a 14d course at rehab.  She has been afebrile
since she was called out to the floor.
.
2. Ureteral stone - The patient had a nephrostomy tube placed by
IR to relieve her hydronephrosis.  She was followed by urology
during her stay and will see them again 2wk after d/c for
definitive treatment of her nephrolithiasis.  At this time,
urology will coordinate removal of her nephrostomy tube with IR.
 Her nephrostomy tube was draining clear yellow urine at the
time of d/c.
.
3. a.fib - The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation
controlled with beta blockers at home.  She was treated in the
MICU as above.  Once on the floor, the patient had one episode
of afib w/ RVR that responded immediately to IV metoprolol.
Because of this, the patient's diltiazem was stopped and she was
started on tid metoprolol.  After this, the patient had no
further problems with her rate control.  She was maintained on a
heparin gtt for bridge to coumadin while on the floor after this
was cleared by IR and urology.  She will be d/c w/out her
heparin as she is trending upwards with her INR and has no MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 65330**]c heart disease.  She will continue her coumadin at
rehab to achieve an INR between [**1-30**].
.
4. delirium - The patient had troubles with agitation while in
the MICU.  She received prn haldol w/ little effect and improved
as her infection cleared.
