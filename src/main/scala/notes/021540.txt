LABS:  Sodium 142, potassium 4.4, chloride 105, CO2 24, BUN
15, creatinine 0.8, glucose 280, CK 142, MB 4, troponin 1,
troponin I 2.6.  White count 15.1, hematocrit 42.8, platelets
333.  PT 13.5, PTT 28.4, INR 1.3.  Electrocardiogram showed
sinus tachycardia at 141, 5?????? axis, V1 through 3 with [**Street Address(2) 94897**] elevation.  V2, 3 and F with 1 to [**Street Address(2) 94898**] depression.
T-waves are inverted in 1, L and V6.  Chest x-ray is
significant for mild congestive heart failure and
questionable left sided effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was treated in the Emergency
Room with Integrilin, intravenous nitroglycerin, aspirin,
Lopressor and intravenous Lasix and following stabilization,
he was brought to the cardiac catheterization lab.  Please
see catheter report for full details.  In summary, the
catheter showed LAD with 90% lesion, left circumflex with a
90% lesion and an RCA with an 80% lesion.  The patient's
ejection fraction was estimated at 10% to 15%.  He had an
intra-aortic balloon pump placed in the cardiac
catheterization lab and he was transferred to the coronary
care unit.  Cardiothoracic surgery was consulted.  The
patient was accepted for coronary artery bypass grafting and
on the following day he was brought to the Operating Room
where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting.  Please
see the Operating Room report for full details.  In summary,
the patient had a coronary artery bypass graft x4 with a left
internal mammary artery to the LAD, saphenous vein graft to
D1, saphenous vein graft to distal LAD and saphenous vein
graft to the RCA.  He tolerated the operation well and was
transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of transfer, the patient
had an oximetric Swan and intra-aortic balloon pump.  He was
on a Levophed drip, milrinone drip, a .............. drip,
dobutamine drip, insulin drip, propofol drip and amiodarone
drip.  The intra-aortic balloon pump was at 1 to 1.

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient was noted
to have a significant amount of bleeding from his chest
tubes.  He returned to the Operating Room at 1:30 on the day
of his surgery for re-exploration due to the mediastinal
bleeding.  No obvious bleeding site was found.  The patient
returned from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit after an intraoperative bronchoscopy
which removed several large mucous plugs.

On postoperative day #1, the patient's sedation was
discontinued.  He was successfully weaned from the ventilator
and extubated.  In addition, his pressor requirement was
significantly reduced.  His dobutamine was weaned to off.
His milrinone was also weaned to off and his Levophed
requirement was significantly diminished.

On postoperative day #2, the patient continued to do well.
He remained hemodynamically stable.  His intra-aortic balloon
pump was weaned to off and discontinued.  Following removal
of the intra-aortic balloon pump, the patient's chest tubes
were also removed.  The patient remained in the Intensive
Care Unit due to the need for aggressive pulmonary toilet.
Over the next two days, the patient continued to be weaned
from the remainder of his cardioactive drugs.  He continued
to receive aggressive pulmonary toilet in the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.  He remained hemodynamically stable.

On postoperative day #5, his pulmonary condition had improved
sufficiently and he was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Six for
continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.
Over the next several days, the patient's activity level was
increased with the assistance of the nursing staff and
physical therapy.

On postoperative day #10, it was deemed that the patient was
stable and ready to be transferred to cardiac rehabilitation
for continuing postoperative care.  At the time of transfer,
the patient's physical exam was as follows:

VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 98.9??????, heart rate 63 sinus rhythm,
blood pressure 109/65, respiratory rate 20, O2 saturation 93%
on room air.  Weight preoperatively is 102 kg, at discharge
is 104 kg.
