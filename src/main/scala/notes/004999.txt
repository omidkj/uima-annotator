Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
aspirin desensitization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
65 y/o woman with hx CAD, DM, HTN, CVA [**11-29**] presented to [**Hospital1 18**]
with CP and dyspnea, had EKG which showed STD V4 through V6 with
trop peak 0.17. There had been some concern for PE and she got
CTA, developed contrast induced nephropathy with Cr peaking at
2.2. A plan was made for cardiac cath but was deferred [**2-22**] acute
renal failure, and because she had been off aspirin (previously
desensitized) and she was sent to rehab for continued medical
management and optimization.
Prior to her previous desensitization she would get
hives,chills, rigors on exposure to ASA
.
On discharge from rehab her Cr was 1.88
On arrival to the floor she was chest pain free and
hemodynamically stable. An EKG was unchanged from prior.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.

Cardiac catheterization
1. Coronary angiography in this co-dominant system demonstrated
two
vessel CAD. The LMCA was very short with mild disease. The LAD
had an
ostial 80% stenosis with a 70% stenosis in the mid vessel. The
LCx had
an ostial 70% stenosis with a 60% stenosis after OM1 before the
L-PDA.
OM2 had a 70% stenosis. The RCA was small and co-dominant with
diffuse
irregularities.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic
arterial
systolic hypertension with an SBP 141 mmHg.
3. There was no pressure gradient between the left ventricle and
ascending aorta to suggest aortic stenosis.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel CAD.
2. Moderate systemic hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 y/o woman with hx CAD, DM, HTN, CVA [**11-29**] s/p NSTEMI in
[**Month (only) 956**] presenting for ASA desensitization prior to cath. Cath
was also deferred due to contrast induced /hypertensive
nephropathy.
.
# CORONARIES: CAD with cath [**11/2128**] showing diffuse LAD and Lcx
disease with cath deferred for NSTEMI in [**Month (only) **] secondary to renal
failure/asa allergy. She had previously undergone aspirin
desensitization but had at some point stopped taking aspirin
consistently. She underwent aspirin desensitization without
adverse event. On arrival from rehab the patients creatine was
still elevated at 1.9. She received prehydration and mucomyst
with her Cr 1.7 on the morning prior to her catheterization.Her
cardiac catheterization showed stable 2 vessel disease which was
not amenable to intervention. Cardiothoracic surgery consulted
on the patient and are considering coronary artery bypass
however she has multiple comorbidities and medical problems
which need to be optimized before she can undergo this surgery.
She will go to rehab for medical management. Her cardiac medical
management was continued with a high dose statin, labetolol,
plavix. Lisinopril continued to be held in the setting of her
renal failure but renal function should be assessed by her PCP
and lisinopril resumed when appropriate. The patient must
continue to take aspirin on a daily basis as missing doses for
greater than 48 hours will require repeat admission to the ICU
for desensitization. She will follow up with cardiothoracic
surgery in [**Month (only) 547**].
.
Renal Failure: Acute on chronic Renal Failure. The patient's
creatinine had been 1.1 in early [**Month (only) 956**]. She was hospitalized
after presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath, had a
CTA with dye load given to rule out for PE and subsequently
developed contrast induced nephropathy. She had also been in
hypertensive emergency that admission, which was thought to have
also contributed to her acute on chronic renal failure. On this
admission she had a Cr 1.9 and FENA 1.5 on admission. She
received prehydration and mucomyst before and after her cardiac
catheterization, with Cr 1.8 on discharge. Tight blood pressure
control was maintained during her admission and her lisinopril
continued to be held given its nephrotoxic potential. Her PCP
will continue to monitor her renal function as an outpatient,
and can decide when to resume her lisinopril.
.
# PUMP:Echo in [**3-2**] showed diastolic CHF, EF 55%.LVH pulmonary
HTN. Some volume overload with pitting edema however giving
gentle hydration in liue of cath for renoprotection. She was
able to tolerate this volume without any difficulty.
Her home lasix was held on discharge and will be resumed at the
discretion of her PCP.

#HTN: On admission her BP was in the 170s. Her labetolol was
being held per the aspirin desensitization protocol at that
time.She received IV hydral as well as her home norvasc,isordil
and p.o hydral with good effect. Following her successful
aspirin desensitization, her labetolol was restarted and her BP
was maintained within the normal range.
.
# Anemia: Hct 29, baseline 33, trending down over last month.
Prior iron studies, hemolysis labs negative. Her hematocrit was
stable at 25-28 this admission and she had no evidence of
bleeding and this was presumed to be anemia of chronic disease.
Age appropriate malignancy screening should be performed as an
outpatient with screening colonoscopy.
.
Back Pain: She had a history of chronic back pain for which she
continued to receive lidoderm patch to upper/lower back,
oxycodone 5, tylenol 650 mg prn pain, neurontin 300mg q24
(renally dosed), ultram 50mg TID and a bowel regimen of senna,
colace and lactulose.
.
#Diabetes: On lantus, Novolog SS at home . She continued lantus,
1/2 dose while npo
and was on an insulin sliding scale wit
