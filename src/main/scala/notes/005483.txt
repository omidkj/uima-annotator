respiratory failure requiring MICU stay related to acute on
chronic diastolic/systolic HF who presents from NH with
tachycardia, increasing secretions, and tachypnea non-responsive
to supplementatal oxygen. Given patient's baseline status,
history obtained from ED records and ED resident. Per report,
patient was found unresponsive to verbal or painful stimulation,
with pale skin and diaphoretic by the staff at NH. EMS was

IMAGING:
=======
CXR on [**2113-10-4**]
Persistent left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
Superimposed consolidation at the left lung base cannot be
excluded. The
right lung remains well aerated.

CT of the head w/o contrast on [**2113-10-4**]:
No intracranial hemorrhage or acute abnormalities. Chronic left
temporoparietal infarct. Enlarged ventricles suggesting
normal-pressure
hydrocephalus.

CT of abdomen and pelvis on [**2113-10-8**]
CT ABDOMEN: Small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
right, have increased. There is also mild bibasilar atelectasis,
left greater than right. Dense coronary artery calcifications
are unchanged. Likely non-calcified pleural plaque at the right
lung base between right ribs 10 and 11 is unchanged. Absence of
intravenous contrast limits evaluation of the abdominal
parenchymal organs and vasculature. Mild-to-moderate ascites
throughout the abdomen is new. There is diffuse anasarca within
the soft tissues. Liver is grossly unremarkable. There is no
biliary ductal dilatation. Mild gallbladder wall edema is likely
secondary to ascites. Gallbladder is not distended. Pancreas
remains fatty and atrophic. Scattered periportal and
gastrohepatic lymph nodes measure up to 8 mm in size, not
meeting CT criteria for pathologic enlargement. Spleen is
diminutive, but otherwise unremarkable. Non-contrast appearance
of the kidneys is unremarkable. G-tube remains in place within a
nearly completely decompressed stomach. Intra-abdominal loops of
bowel are
unremarkable. There is no sign of obstruction. Diffuse
atherosclerotic
calcification of the abdominal aorta and its branches is
unchanged. There is no free intraperitoneal air.
CT PELVIS: Pelvic loops of large and small bowel are
unremarkable. Rectal
tube is in place. Foley catheter is in place within decompressed
bladder.
Small amount of air remains within the dorsal aspect of the
bladder, likely related to instrumentation. Previously noted
rectal stool impaction has resolved.   Diffuse osteopenia is
unchanged. Multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracolumbar
spine are stable. There is no fracture. There is no osseous
lesion suspicious for malignancy.

Echocardiogram on [**2113-10-11**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to extensive apical akinesis
(with focal dyskinesis), anterior septal akinesis, and
hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle with relative
sparing only of the basal inferior and posterior segments. The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated
