History of Present Illness:
This is a 63 year old morbidly obese insulin dependent diabetic
female with severe aortic stenosis. This past [**Month (only) **] she was
admitted to the hospital for exacerbation of jher chronic lung

CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis [**2162-4-15**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Consolidation within the left lower lobe and the left upper
lobe are noted
which may represent pneumonia. Atelectatic changes of both lungs
are also
identified.

2. No fluid collection is identified within the abdomen and
pelvis.

3. Enlarged calcified thyroid gland is encasing the trachea.
This needs
further evaluation on a non-emergent basis.

CT Head [**2162-4-15**]
IMPRESSION:

1. Scattered sequelae of chronic small vessel infarction, with a
additional
asymmetric hypodensity within the white matter of the left
frontal lobe,
without significant mass effect to suggest edema, and with
sparing of the
overlying cortex. This is concerning for an evolving
subacute-to-chronic
infarct. Comparison with prior imaging, if available, would be
helpful,
alternatively, MRI could be considered for further evaluation.

2. No intracranial hemorrhage.

3. Opacification of the mastoid air cells and mucosal disease of
the
paranasal sinuses.

Intra-op TEE
Pre-bypass:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is
present. A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is
seen at rest. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate/severe mitral valve prolapse. There
is severe mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-bypass:
The patient is not receiving inotropic support post-CPB. There
is a well-seated mechanical valve in the aortic position with
good bileaflet excursion. There is no paravalvular or
transvalvular regurgitation. The mean pressure gradient across
the valve is 13 mm Hg at a cardiac output of 6.2 L/min.
Biventricular systolic function is preserved with a hyperdynamic
left ventricle (LVEF >75%). All other findings are consistent
with pre-bypass findings. The aorta is intact
post-decannulation. All findings were discussed with the surgeon
intraoperatively.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 10378**] was admitted and underwent an aortic valve
replacement by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please see operative report for
surgical details. Following surgery she was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring.

She did well initially, weaning from bypass on Propofol alone.
She was extubated and stable. Approximately 48 hours after
surgery she developed cardiogenic shock and pulmonary edema,
requiring intubation, multiple inotropes and a Lasix drip.
Echocardiograms showed only moderate to severe left ventricular
hypertrophy with no evidence o
