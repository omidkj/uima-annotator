History of Present Illness:
68 year old male with no known prior medical care who was found
on the floor covered in feces, with bottle of vodka and
cigarettes scattered around him. Fell at 2:30 AM. Per EMS last
drink was at 3AM. Called 911 this morning. EMS noted that his
floor was covered in diarrhea. A section 12 was placed by EMS
which was subsequently lifted when he was found to be calm and
cooperative on arrival to the ED.
.
On admission he denies any trauma but states that he may have
fallen. He states he has not eaten in the past eight days noting
that he just didn't feel like eating. Has been drinking fluids
and vodka. No specific nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain. He
thinks he has lost a lot of weight from not eating although he
is not sure since he hasn't weighed himself. Across the past 8
days he has felt quite fatigued but he credits this to not
eating as well.
.
He denies chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain,
nausea or vomiting. He states that he feels very weak and was
unable to walk this morning due to this but he denies any
specific lightheadedness or dizziness. Denies black or bloody
stools. He states he has never seen a doctor and is unaware of
any medical problems.
.
In the ED inital vitals were temp 95.9, hr 104, bp 103/71, rr
20, 99% on room air. A bear hugger was started due to
hypothermia. He was started on vanc/zosyn due to concern for
sepsis in the setting of hypothermia and a lactate of 12. Also
started on stress dose steroids as well as thiamine, folic acid,
calcium and magnesium. Guaic negative.
.
He was briefly hypotensive to SBPs of 60s-70s which was
confirmed manually. A right IJ line was placed. Started on
stress dose steroids. Received 2 units of packed RBCs and 3L of
NS. His lactate trended from 11.9 to 5.6. He did not require any
pressors. He has remained normotensive since. AOx3. Being
admitted to ICU for episode of hypotension and elevated lactate.
.
On arrival to the ICU he appeared comfortable and had no
specific complaints. He said that he wanted to go home and go to
sleep. He explained that his neighbor (the one who brings him
the vodka) had found him and called 911 because he was on the
floor and felt weak. He does not specifically remember falling
last night but thinks his last drink was about 2AM. Reports
loose stools for last few weeks with 3-4 bowel movements per
day. He denies any other recent symptoms.
.
He said that he has not left his house for the last month. He
mostly watches TV in his bedroom and walks between the bedroom
and the bathroom. He said that the kitchen is too far away so he
tries not to walk there unless he has to.
.
Review of OMR shows that he was seen in the ED almost a year ago
for a fall also in the setting of EtOH. Also of note he has lost
a significant amount of weight as compared to his driver's
license.

Images:
[**2132-1-27**] EKG: sinus tach at 100, left axis deviation, right
bundle branch block, inferior Q waves, no prior
CXR [**2132-1-27**]: 1. Concern for small left-sided hydropneumothorax
of uncertain etiology. 2. 13 mm right lower lobe pulmonary
nodule. Differential includes nipple shadow, osseous lesion, or
pulmonary parenchymal nodule. Followup radiographs with oblique
projections and nipple markers could be considered.
Alternatively, CT of the chest could also be performed for
further characterization of the left-sided pleural process and
the right lower lobe nodule. 3. No confluent consolidation or
pulmonary edema.
CXR [**2132-1-28**]: Mild pulmonary edema is new. Opacification of the
base of the left lung, accompanied by elevation of the left
hemidiaphragm is substantially atelectasis, now accompanied by
small pleural effusion. Followup advised to exclude developing
pneumonia in this location from presumed aspiration. Heart size
is normal. No pneumothorax. Right jugular line ends in the SVC.
Abdominal ultrasound [**2132-1-28**]: The liver is diffusely echogenic
