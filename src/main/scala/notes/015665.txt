HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 41-year-old
female with past medical history significant for alcoholic
cirrhosis and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome,
hemachromatosis, and history of neuropathy and myopathy, who
presented for orthotopic liver transplant on [**2136-6-4**].  Her
operation was relatively uneventful.  She had a duct-duct
anastomosis and two JPs.  When she left the operating room,
she left intubated.

On postoperative day #1, she had a positive fluid balance,
however, her mechanics were quite good.  Made decision to
electively extubate was made.  Later in the day, the patient
became progressively more agitated requiring increasing
oxygen and sedative medications, and ultimately, she has to
be reintubated.  She was noted to have high pulmonary artery
pressures and an echocardiogram revealed a new papillary
muscle dysfunction in the mitral valve with 3-4+ MR.  This in
combination with the intraoperative events of her having a
V-fib, V-tach arrest requiring ACLS resuscitation at the time
of the unclamping of her IVC, prompted a rule out protocol
that ultimately revealed that she had in-fact ruled in for a
myocardial infarction.

The Cardiology service investigated the patient and
ultimately she underwent a coronary catheterization.  No
stenting procedure was performed, however, there was mild RCA
disease that would explain the papillary muscle dysfunction.
Her medical therapy was optimized.  She was not
anticoagulated, and ultimately her MR improved as her
ischemia resolved.

Her postoperative course otherwise was remarkable for what
was presumed to be possible alcoholic withdrawal to some
extent.  Although she had been abstinent for many years, and
she does have underlying anxiety disorder, it was quite
difficult to control her sedation, therefore she required
inpatient psychiatric consultation for assistance with her
medication regimen.

Over the next couple of weeks in the Intensive Care Unit, the
patient's ventilatory support had been easily weaned, and she
was ultimately extubated approximately a week after
transplant.  The patient was serially diuresed, and her
immunosuppression levels were followed accordingly.
Ultimately by postoperative day #15, the patient was
discharged to the floor, where over the next 3-4 days the
patient continued to ambulate, tolerate a diet, move her
bowels without any difficulty.  She remained afebrile.  There
is no evidence of other opportunistic or iatrogenic
infection.

On the day of discharge, her temperature is 99.0 with a blood
pressure of 120/74, heart rate 62, respiratory rate of 18,
and 95% on room air saturation.  Fingersticks were under 165.
Her white count was 9.2 with a hematocrit of 32.5 and a
platelet count of 319.  Her PT and INR were 13 and 1.2.
Chemistries were remarkable for a potassium of 4.2, BUN and
creatinine of 29 and 1.3.  Her albumin is 3.6.  ALT and AST
were 18 and 13, alkaline phosphatase 105, total bilirubin
equals 2.0.  Otherwise, the patient had a cyclosporin level
of 351.  Remainder of her physical exam was benign.  She had
decreased breath sounds at the right base.  Her wound was
intact, clean, and dry with staples.  No drainage.

Remainder of examination unremarkable except for some right
lower extremity edema.  She was ruled out for DVT by Duplex
of the lower extremity prior to the day of discharge.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Valcyte 450 mg po q day.
2. Fluconazole 400 mg q day.
3. Bactrim single strength one tablet q day.
4. Protonix 40 mg q day.
5. Lopressor 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
6. Captopril 25 mg [**Hospital1 **].
7. Aspirin 81 mg q day.
8. OxyContin 10 mg po bid.
9. Lasix 20 mg po q day.
10. Neurontin 600 mg tid.
11. Dilaudid po prn.
12. Coumadin 3 mg po q day for a goal INR of 1.5-2 given her
antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and risk of hepatic artery
thrombosis.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Have her PT/INR drawn in 48 hours
from time of discharge.  To see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the Transplant
coordinators in the clinic approximately 3-5 days from time
of discharge.  She will have her Neoral levels which she will
leave on Neoral 100 mg [**Hospital1 **], prednisone 15 mg a day, and
CellCept 1,000 mg po bid.  Her Neoral will be titrated
serially as an outpatient.  She will get immunosuppression
levels checks with a goal level of 350-400.

DISCHARGE/DISPOSITION:  Home, stable, afebrile, tolerating a
diet.
