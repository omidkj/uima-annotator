Echo: EF > 60% The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen.  There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Bradycardia - sinus arrest but qrs narrowed and p waves
returned as flecanide wore off, symptomatic with
confusion/CHF/weakness, possible etiology from poor renal
clearence of flecainide and BB, r/o'ed out for MI. Pt eventually
restarted on metoprolol and rate returned to [**Location 213**].  Pt had
pacemaker placed to prevent bradycardia.

2) Afib - Pt had a few episodes of WCT which appeared to be A.
fib.  Pt bounced back and forth from WCT to bradycardia and then
HR eventually stabalized.  Pt remained in A.fib (narrow
complex).    Once pacemaker pt started on amiodorone.  Pt was to
get cardioversion but Afib spontaneously converted with
amiodorone.  Pt started on heparin drip which was eventually
bridged with warfarin.  Pt was sent home on warfarin and
lovenox.

2) CHF due to diastolic dysfxn w/ pulm edema causing hypoxia-
hypertensive.  TTE showed a normal EF (60%).  Pt initially given
lasix and metolazone for diureses and then switched to natrecor
which caused her to diurese.  CXR initially was consistent with
pulmonary edema.  Pt blood pressure during hospital stay
remianed high so pt started on nitroprusside drip and IV
hydralazine for afterload reduction.  Natrecor was stopped and
pt was weaned off nitroprusside and started on oral hydralazine
and isordil.  Htn medication simplified to isordil, metoprolol,
and norvasc and hydralazine.

3) Renal Failure - chronic w/ RAS s/p failed stent. Cre on
admission was as high as 2.4 but began to trend down throughout
hospital course.

4) Anemia - likely secondary to CRI and Waldestrom's. Guaiac
(-), continued to guaiac stools.  Pt got 2 units of blood and
iron workup was consistent for anemia of chronic disease.

5) Confusion - ? Delerium from hypoxia vs. Atropine. multiple
medical conditions. agitated and difficult to oxygenate, used
ativan to control pt agitation. Pt got head CT which showed no
acute bleed.  Pt was eventually weaned off ativan. Py mental
status returned to baseline during hospital course.

6) leukocytosis and fever. Pt was given Vanc/Levo for possible
aspiration pna. CXR suggested possible aspiration PNA in LLL.
Blood cultures and urine cultures sent.  Pt WBC returned to
[**Location 213**] value while in hospital.  Pt finished course of
antibiotics while in hospital.
