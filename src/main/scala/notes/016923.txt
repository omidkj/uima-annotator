History of Present Illness:
A 66yoM with HTN who presented with increasing intermittent
chest pain. Patient described [**8-6**] pain, chest tightness,
associated with nausea, diaphoresis and shortness of breath, no
radiation to the left arm/jaw or back that started on [**2172-1-13**] at
~3pm while working on some wood furniture. His pain was not
relieved with rest and lasted for about 9 hours resolving around
midnight on [**2172-1-13**]. His pain recurred on the afternoon of
admission while patient was accompanying his wife to his wife's
cardiologist appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65204**].  Given that his pain
started again, ECG was done which showed NSR at 80bpm, nl. axis,
Q- waves in v2-v4, II, III and AvF, and 3-[**Street Address(2) 5366**] elevations in
v3-v6.  He was sent immediatly to [**Hospital3 2737**] where he was
started on a heparin gtt, nitro gtt and aggrastat gtt.  He also
received ASA 81mgx4, plavix 300mg, and lopressor 5 mg IV. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for urgent cath.  On review of systems, Pt.
denied lower extremity edema, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and
reports dyspnea on exertion when climbing about two flight of
stairs.

.
Cardiac Cath [**2172-1-14**]: 1. Coronary angiography revealed a right
dominant system. The LMCA showed no angiographically apparent
flow-limiting stenosis. The LAD demonstrated a discrete 70%
proximal stenosis immediately followed by a hazy 100% midsegment
occlusion, with no collateral flow evident to the distal LAD.
The LCX demonstrated diffuse 50% proximal and midsegment
stenoses with a 805 distal segment stenosis. The RCA
demonstrated a 100% proximal segment occlusion with minimal
distal right to right collaterals. 2. Cinematographic imaging of
catheter injection into the left ventricle allowed approximation
of left ventricular function, demonstrating anteroapical
akinesis and inferior hypokinesis, with preserved anterobasal LV
wall motion.  Ejection fraction is estimated to be 25-30%. 3.
Hemodynamic studies demonstrated significantly elevated right
atrial pressures of 20 mmHg with moderately elevated pulmonary
arterial pressures of 55 mmHg. Pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was severely elevated at 30 mmHg, which is suggestive
of severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and volume
overload.  Cardiac index is severely depressed at 1.6 L/min/m2
(normal 2.5 or greater, with corresponding cardiac output of 2.9
L/min). There was no evidence of pressure gradients suggestive
of mitral or aortic stenosis. 4. Successful stenting of the LAD
with a 2.75 mm and a 3.0 mm Taxus drug-eluting stent. FINAL
DIAGNOSIS: 1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 2. Severe
systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction. 3. Moderate
primary pulmonary hypertension. 4. Acute anterior wall
myocardial infarction. 5. Successful stenting of the LAD.
.
Echo [**2172-1-15**]: The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
mid to distal anteroseptal, anterior, and anteroalteral
akinesis, apical akinesis, and basal inferior akinesis (thinned
inferior wall). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There
is focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right
ventricle. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.
.
Cardiac cath [**2172-1-17**]: 1. Selective coronary angiography of the
right dominant circulation was performed. The LMCA was patent,
as were all the LAD stents. The LCX had a midvessel 70% lesion
followed by a more distal 70% lesion. The RCA was totally
occluded proximally and was supplied by left-to-right
collaterals. 2. Successful PCI of the LCX with two overlapping
Cypher DES (3.0 x 23 mm and 3.0 x 18 mm). 3. Unsuccessful
attempt at PCI of the totally occluded RCA. 4. Successful
closure of the left femoral arteriotomy site with a Perclose
Proglide device. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Two vessel coronary artery
disease. 2. Successful PCI of the LCX. 3. Unsuccessful attempt
at PCI of the RCA.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 66yoM with h/o [**Hospital **] transferred from OSH with evidence of acute
anterolateral STEMI.  Patient underwent cardiac cath on
admission with successful [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2 to LAD. Patient was
transferred to CCU for further monitoring. He was kept on
Tirofiban for 18 hours, along with aspirin, plavix and statin.
His enzymes peaked on [**2171-1-15**] with CK 5033 and MB>500, and then
slowly trended down. An echo showed an EF 20-25%. The Pt. was
monitored on telemetry throughout the hospitalization.  He
remained in normal sinus rhythm, a reperfusion rhythm was noted
during the first 24 hours post-cath, and later only occasional
PVCs were recorded.
.
Pt. was diuresed 1-2 L after admission, and was discharged on
spironolactone.  A beta-blocker and ACE-inhibitor were slowly
titrated up as his blood pressure tolerated.  He was taken for a
second cath on [**2172-1-17**] in order to fix the LCx lesion. He had
successful PCI of the LCx with two overlapping Cypher DES.
Unsuccessful attempt at PCI of the totally occluded RCA. Patient
did well after the procedure with no complications.
.
Following cath and [**Date Range 461**], heparin was started given
risk of thrombus formation as bridge to warfarin.
