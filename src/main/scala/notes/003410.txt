History of Present Illness:
This is a 85 yo M w/ h/o COPD, DM presents from [**Hospital3 417**]
after polymorphic VT. The day prior to presentation the patient
was golfing when he started to feel lightheaded. The patient has
a chronic history of vertigo that is treated with meclizine but
he states that this was different from his usual vertigo. This
episode was associated with diaphoresis and pain in the neck
that radiated to the jaw. He also had stomach pain. This lasted
30-60 minutes. Patient presented to OSH w/ presyncopal episode.
K on arrival was 3.1. On traimterene/thiazide at home. He was
given total of 100mEq K. He was ruled out for MI. On day of
transfer patient syncopized. Rhythm was polymorphic VT that
patient spontaneously terminated. He was loaded with amiodarone
15- and transferred to ICU. HR was 70 and BP was 130/70 at that
time. QTc was 502 initially but 440 on day of transfer. There
was concern that he might have ACS causing VT so he was stared
on heparin gtt, loaded with plavix, and continued on his aspirin
prior to transfer. He also got 4gm MG empirically. Prior to
transfer K was 2.9 so he got 80 of PO K. Vitals on transfer were
HR 63 93% on 2L 26 BP 123/65.
.
Of note ptient was being treated for COPD exacerbation with
advair, albuterol, atrovent. No pulmonary edema or consolidation
was seen on CXR.
.
He had also been complaining of abdominal pain for 48 hours.
There was some concern for mesenteric ischemia, but no workup
had been done.
.
ROS negative except as noted in HPI. Of note, no abdominal pain
on admission.

CARDIAC CATH RESULTS [**2123-6-7**]
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had
no
significant stenosis.  The LAD had a long 50% lesion in the mid
vessel.
The LCx had a 70% origin lesion and a 50% mid-vessel lesion.
The RCA
had a long 99% proximal complex lesion and an 80% lesion just
beyond the
PDA.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a mildly elevated LVEDP
of 17
mmHg.  There was no gradient upon carefull pullback from left
ventricle
to aorta.  The central aortic pressure was elevated at 160/69
mmHg.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 85 yo M w/ h/o DM, HTN, presents from OSH w/
monomorphic VT
.
# VT: Strips were reviewed and consistent w/ monomorphic VT.  He
was initially maintained on amiodarone drip, which was stopped
on hospital day #2.  Patient ruled out for MI.  He was taken to
cath lab, that demonstrated chronic 3 vessel CAD and mild LV
diastolic dysfunction (no intervention done).  Prior to
discharge, the pt had a cardiac MRI which was pending at the
time of discharge. The EP and CCU teams felt the pt was safe for
discharge on Thursday [**2123-6-10**]. He will return next week when EP
study with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with possible VT ablation can be
arranged.
.
# COPD: He was given Ipratropium/albuterol nebs prn and
advair,which was changed to symbicort (home med) at discharge.
His home theophylline was discontinued given small risk of
arrhythmia with this medication.
.
# Gout: Continued colchicine with 1 extra dose on [**6-8**] for early
gout flare in the ankles which resolved after this dose.
.
# BPH: Continued Flomax.
.
# HTN: Continued losartan and started on spironolactone. Also
started on metoprolol.  Triamtere/hctz was stopped given
hypokalemia, methyldopa also d/c'd.
.
# Chronic dizziness: Continued home meclizine twice daily rather
than four times daily.
