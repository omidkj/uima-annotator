History of Present Illness:
47 year old female s/p renal transplant [**2182**] with severe
restrictive lung disease presents from home for SOB.
.
She did not have pulmonary disease until the summer of [**2196**] when
she was hospitalized for ureteral strictures.  Following
cystoscopy, her hospital course was complicated by ARDS, TRALI
and VAP which led a 6 week hospital stay and a PEG/TRACH.  She
spent the next few months at rehab where the PEG/TRACH was
pulled but has suffered from pulmonary disease ever since.  She
is on home o2, 3LNC at baseline and 5LNC with any exertion.  She
had been following Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7474**] at [**Hospital **] Clinic.  She had
PFTs done in [**Month (only) 205**] that showed severe restrictive disease.  She
has had a chronic problem with oxygenation and workup so far
included CT scan done last week that showed progression of
bilateral upper lobe ground glass opacities.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7474**]
discussed the findings with the patient and it was decided that
she get a repeat CT in 4 weeks and she may need to proceed to
[**Last Name (STitle) **] with Bx to determine the cause of the ground glass
opacities.  The differential according to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7474**] for the GGO
include alveolitis ([**1-5**] PCP or HP) or a superimposed viral
syndrome since she complained of upper respiratory symptoms 4
days prior to that CT.
.
Chronically, the patient seems to retain CO2.  According to
serial ABGs, her PaCO2 is chronically about 50.  At baseline,
she reports doing housework with includes walking up the stairs
and doing laudry.  Over the past 3 days, she is unable to do
much housework becuase of SOB.  She also reports a fever to 103,
measure by her sister and [**Name2 (NI) **] with blood tinged sputum.  She
has been using her albuterol and advair with mild improvement.
.
In the ED, her initial vitals were: 98.4, 101, 172/77, 35, 66%
on 4LNC.  She was put on a NRB and ABG was 7.18, 75, 206.  She
was treated for a presumed COPD flare with 125mg IV solumedrol,
ceftrixone, azithromycin and combivents.  Because of her initial
poor oxygen saturation, she was treated for a PE emperically
with heparin.  CTA was not done due to ARF.  Repeat ABG was
7.39, 75, 53 on a high flow face mask.  Because of her tenous
respiratory status, she was sent to MICU for futher care.

# CXR [**2198-7-9**]:
No infiltrate.  No pleural effusion.  Some cephalization.
.
# CT CHEST OUTPATIENT [**2198-6-29**]:
1.  Interim progression of diffuse upper lung ground glass,
consistent with alveolitis.  The differential diagnosis includes
pneumocystis carinii, hypersensitivity, and drug reaction.
2.  Improved basilar consolidations, with plate-like atelectasis
now seen at both bases.
3.  Moderate simple pericardial effusion, unchanged and without
CT evidence of tamponade.
4.  Increased size of hilar lymph nodes, possibly related to
alveolitis.
5.  Coronary artery calcifications, noteworthy in a patient of
this age.
6.  Focal narrowing of the airway at the thoracic inlet, at the
level of the clavicular heads, possibly stenosis complicated by
malacia.
.
# ECHO [**4-/2198**]: EF 60%
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity  size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
is normal. There is a small to moderate pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: normal LV and RV function. Small pericardial
effusion without evidence of tamponade. Compared to the prior
study dated [**2198-3-31**], no significant change.
.
[**2198-7-10**] Bronchial lavage:

  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

  Numerous hemosiderin-laden macrophages and few bronchial
  cells.

[**2198-7-10**] Chest CT:1. Worsening of the diffuse pulmonary process
with increased ground-glass opacity and new peribronchial patchy
ill-defined opacities in both lungs, more prominent in upper
lobes, as well as increased consolidation in lingula and lower
lobes with new bilateral small effusion. Increased pericardial
effusion with cardiomegaly and reactive lymphadenopathy. Finding
is most likely due to diffuse infectious process, such as virus,
or bacteria, or other atypical infections, or alveolitis, or
eosinophilic lung disease. Correlation with BAL result is
recommended.Given the fact that the upper lobe predominant
disease has progressed steadily over a few months, an
accelerated idiopathic/reactive alveolitis is strongly
considered. If BAC is non-contributory, a lung biopsy might also
be considered. The lingular and basal disease might represent
unrelated ventiltor associated disease.
