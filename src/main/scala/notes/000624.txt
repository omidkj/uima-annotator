Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1055**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain. Transferred from OSH.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with stent placed in CBD [**2195-12-24**]
Endotracheal intubation [**2195-12-24**]; extubated [**2195-12-29**]

History of Present Illness:
67 yo male, h/o 3vd, [**Month/Day/Year **] s/p ablation in [**4-27**] at [**Hospital1 2025**], RA,
diastolic dysfunction, who presented from [**Hospital 1263**] hospital with
?biliary sepsis.  Pt reports that on day of admission, he woke
up with malaise, nausea, vomiting, fevers, and rigors.  He went
to [**Doctor Last Name 1263**] ED, found to be febrile with abnormal LFT's, was
started on antibiotics  (clinda/ceftaz) and IVF, and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for presumed biliary sepsis and further
management.  On transfer, he was started on zosyn/levo/flagyl,
was hemodynamically unstable, was intubated prior to ERCP.  ERCP
showed no obstruction, no stones, some biliary sludging only
(normal cholangiogram).  A stent was placed in the CBD.  He
continued to by hypotensive/unstable post ERCP, was found to
have an evolving NSTEMI (tnt leak, 2mm ST depre in v3-v6; peak
tnt 1.8, now trended down).  He remained intubated.  SWAN on
[**12-24**] showed PCWP 35, BP 95/43, FA=22, and the next warning, he
went into rapid afib with decompensation requiring single 200 J
shock.  He was on 3 pressors at the time (levophed, vasopressin,
dopa), converted into NSR temporarily, was started on amio. He
had recurrence of afib.  DCCV was repeated 2 times without
success; he spontaneously reverted to NSR (?s/p DCCV on [**12-26**])
has remained in this rhythm, and is on an amio taper (drip).
Cardiology is following.  Etiology of this new onset afib was
thought to be in the setting of volume resuscitation and acute
illness.

With respect to his sepsis, he required 3 pressors as above, was
on vanco/zosyn/lev/flagyl.  Blood cultures from [**Doctor Last Name 1263**] grew out
[**4-26**] E. coli (with E. coli also in urine) resistant to
amp/pip/sulbactam.  Ciprofloxacin was added to regimen on [**12-26**].
He is currently just on cipro and is to complete a 14 day course
for E. coli.  He continued to improve clinically, was extubated
on [**12-29**], and he was transferred to the floor on [**12-30**] (stable,
mentating).  Other MICU events include a drop in platelets
following 48 hours of heparin therapy (HIT negative, Hep d/c'ed,
and platelets recovering).  He had a bump in his creatinine to
3.0 (baseline 1.3-1.5 as per PCP) which is resolving (?ATN [**2-23**]
hypotension but no muddy brown casts on sediment).  Renal US was
obtained that did not show hydronephrosis or cause or ARF.  Hct
has been stable, but he has been guaiac positive on exam.  Pt
was stable on transfer to the floor.

[**2195-12-29**] 3:59 PM
PORTABLE RENAL ULTRASOUND: Limited views of both kidneys were
obtained. The right kidney measures 11.7 cm. The left kidney
measures 11.2 cm. There is no evidence of renal stones,
hydronephrosis, or perinephric fluid collections.

IMPRESSION:
Limited portable exam shows no significant abnormalities.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2195-12-24**] 3:21 AM
An AP portable study of the chest was obtained. No prior studies
available for comparison. There is poor inspiratory effort. The
lungs are clear of an active congestion or infiltration. No
evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothoraces. The cardiac size
cannot be evaluated on this AP portable study of the chest. A
left subclavian CVP line is in place the tip is entering the
superior vena cava.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of active diseases in the lungs or
heart.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY) PORT  [**2195-12-24**] 6:44 PM: There are multiple
mildly gas distended loops of small bowel and gas present in the
colon. A plastic biliary stent is present in the right upper
quadrant. The diaphragms are not included on the film.

IMPRESSION: Mildly gas distended loops of small bowel,
nonspecific.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) PORT  [**2195-12-24**] 3:53 AM:
FINDINGS: Examination is limited due to patient body habitus.
Allowing for this, liver appears echogenic, consistent with
fatty infiltration. No focal masses are identified. There is no
intrahepatic or extrahepatic ductal dilatation. The common bile
duct measures 6 mm in diameter. The gallbladder contains sludge,
but there are no secondary signs of cholecystitis. Specifically,
there is no wall edema, pericholecystic fluid, or gallbladder
distention. Normal color flow is identified within the main
portal and hepatic veins. There is no ascites. Note is made of a
markedly atrophic right kidney, with evidence of cortical
thinning.

IMPRESSION:

1) Echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration. Please
note that more severe forms of liver disease, including
significant hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis, cannot be excluded
on the basis of this study.

2) Gallbladder sludge but no secondary signs of cholecystitis.

3) No evidence of biliary obstruction.

4) Patent portal and hepatic veins
