Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
Right flank pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
45-year-old Female with lupus nephritis s/p living related renal
x-plant in [**2136**] who presented with right flank pain for the past
4 days. She has had rising creatinine over the last couple of
months and had a biopsy in [**2147-2-11**] with evidence of chronic
allograft nephropathy. She is currently undergoing another
transplant evaluation from another brother as she is chronically
rejecting.
.
On admission, the patient reported 3-4 days of right flank pain.
She described the pain as a burning [**11-19**] pain, without
significant radiation, located over the flank and the back
approximately at the level of the iliac crest. She denied any
pain over her transplanted kidney. She had been tolerating POs
without any n/v/d. She denied any trauma to the site prior to
development of pain or musculoskeletal strain. She also denied
any f/c/r, hematuria, dysuria, and urinary frequency. The
patient also denied any sick contacts (although she works as a
clinical lab technician drawing labs from patients in local med
center), as well as any travel or exposure to new pets. Of note,
she did have an illness with diarrhea approximately one month
ago, but recently she had been having one regular stool/day. In
terms of medications, she has been compliant with her
medications without any missed doses. She has been prescribed
Ultram for PRN pain which she has been taking nightly for years.
With the onset of pain, she has been taking 1-2 tabs Q6 hours
over the last 4 days. The only new medications are Aranesp
injections as well as iron tablets started 6 weeks ago for
anemia. She was previously on lisinopril for several months
which was stopped in [**Month (only) 547**] due to Angioedema.
.
In the ED, she was thought to have had some tenderness to
palpation. A renal graft ultrasound was performed and
demonstrated increasing size and edema of the kidney. The
transplant service was called, but did not have any specific
recommendations. The patient was given morphine 2mg x2, at which
point she developed nausea and vomiting. She was subsequently
given Dilaudid 2mg x1, and Anzemet 12.5mg x2.
.
At 4AM her peripheral IV infiltrated. The IV nurse found her
unresponsive, grey, clammy, and hypoxic (?) with an oxygen sat
of 40%. She was hypotensive to 100/palp (nl sbp 180) and mildly
tachycardic with a heart rate of 100. Her fingerstick at that
time was 200. She was placed on a NRB with an increase of her
oxygen sats to 100% at which time she quickly regained
consciousness. She was rapidly titrated down to 2L via nasal
cannula with an O2 sat of 100%. Her ABG (?timing and ?FiO2) was
7.3/65/70.
.
On review of systems here in the ICU, she has not had any
fevers, chills, SOB, CP, weight loss, recent diarrhea, rashes,
hematuria, or traumatic injuries. She does snore at night and
likely has sleep apnea from what her husband has told her. On
further reflection, she has felt much more tired recently and
has been "sleepy."

RENAL TRANSPLANT ULTRASOUND [**2148-6-20**]: Transplanted right kidney
now measures 12.3 cm in length, and previously measured 9.7 cm.
There is a heterogeneous and edematous appearance of the
transplanted kidney. There are no peritransplant fluid
collections. There is no hydronephrosis or stone. The arterial
and venous flow is patent and normal. The RIs range from
0.58-0.67. IMPRESSION: Compared to the prior examination, the
transplanted kidney has increased in size and has an edematous
appearance. There is normal flow demonstrated with RIs within
normal limits. There is no peritransplant fluid collection.
.
CXR: Subtle opacity in the right lower lobe concerning for early
pneumonia or aspiration. Mild cardiomegaly. Pulmonary arterial
hypertension.
.
V/Q scan [**2148-6-21**]:
Perfusion images in 8 views show slightly heterogeneous
perfusion without definite focal perfusion defect. Ventilation
images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m aerosol in the same 8 views
demonstrate
some central deposition of tracer consistent with airway
disease. There are no mismatched defects.
Chest x-ray shows right lower lobe pneuomonia.
IMPRESSION: Low likehood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypoxia/Hypercarbia - The patient was ruled out for PE with a
V/Q scan that was low-prob. CXR was consistent with pneumonia
and the pt was started on levofloxacin. Her O2 sats improved
gradually as did her cough and on day of discharge her
ambulatory sats were 94% on RA. She was discharged to complete a
10 day course of levofloxacin.
.
# Flank pain: Given the increase in size as well as the
edematous appearance of the x-planted kidney with associated sx
of pain and nausea, there was a possibility of acute on chronic
rejection of the x-planted kidney. However she had no
pain/tenderness over her transplanted kidney and she has a
creatinine of 3 which was lower than it has been since [**Month (only) 958**]
[**2148**]. Ultrasound of the transplanted kidney showed that it had
increased in size and had an edematous appearance. However,
normal flow was demonstrated with RIs within normal limits. On
the 3rd day of admission the pt developed a
