History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 487**] is a 67-year-old man with a history of CHF,

to 105, HR 137, BP 72/31 RR 28 SpO2 98%. EKG reveal afib with
RVR and ST depressions in V4-6. Labs were notable for a WBC
27.6, PLT 45, INR 2.3, creatinine 4.1 digoxin 0.5. A femoral
line was placed and he was given levaquin and zosyn for presumed
urosepsis given a positive UA (packed WBC, 4+ bacteria). CT
abd/pelvis without contrast showed no free air and no bowel wall
thickening. He received 6 L IVF and was started on dopamine and
levophed prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED VS were 98.9 130 77/49 28 100% 3L
Dopamine was discontinued due to tachycardia and levophed was
titrated up. He was given decadron 10 mg IV and 1 L IVF.
Transplant surgery was consulted to evaluate for mesenteric
ischemia given elevated lactate, WBC and intermittent abdominal
pain. They recommended admission to MICU.
.
Of note, records from OSH mention admission on [**2188-8-13**] for SBP
and recent Klebsiella infection.
.
Review of systems: Unable to assess due to confusion.
