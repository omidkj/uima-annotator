History of Present Illness:
75 yr old W with PMH of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, COPD,
ulcerative colitis who was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 77005**] to
[**Hospital 4199**] Hospital with b/l upper lobe pneumonia and COPD
exacerbation.  Following the pneumonia she was discharged to
rehab facility on [**1-18**], but returned to [**Location 4199**] with abdominal
pain, no BMs, nausea, and difficulty taking PO meds on [**1-21**] and
found to have a small bowel obstruction. CT abd/pelvis [**1-22**]
showed small pneumoperitoneum, SBO, ascites, pericardial
effusion, and bibasilar bronchiectasis.  She underwent
exploratory lap and lysis of adhesions on [**1-22**].  NG tube was
placed, and she was made NPO after surgery.  Post op, her
hematocrit dropped to 25.9 from 32, and she was transfused 2
units with a bump to 34.4.
.
On the morning of transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], while being transferred to
chair in ICU, patient was noted to have 10mm ST elevation
anterolaterally on telemetry, confirmed by 12 lead ekg (V2-V6,
I, aVR). She was asymptomatic at this time, with no chest pain.
She was noted to be hypertensive.  Initial markers minimally
elevated: CPK 79, index 7.8, trop 0.12. WBC 22.5 (down from 36)
but she was on solumedrol and unasyn for PNA.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for cardiac catheterization.

COPD
GERD
Anemia
Depression/Anxiety
Dermatitis/Eczema
s/p back surgery for bone spur and disc

Social History:
Social history is significant for hx of tobacco use, quit 3 yrs

[**2118-2-3**] Flow Cytometry: INTERPRETATION
Non-specific T cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic
immunophenotypic features of involvement by leukemia/lymphoma
are not seen in specimen.  Correlation with clinical findings is
recommended.  Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may not detect
all lymphomas due to topography, sampling or artifacts of sample
preparation.
