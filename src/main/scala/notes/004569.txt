Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Ciprofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cath on [**6-21**]; no intervention done

History of Present Illness:
78 year old female PmHx of HTN, CKD, CHF, and CAD s/p PCI and
CABG [(MI [**2175**] w/ PCI to the LAD and acute CHF in [**2182**] w/
LIMA-LAD and PCI/DES to LCX to Left Main (since no saphenous
veins) complicated by VT arrest x 2 s/p ICD (Guidant Vitality
DS)] transfered from [**Hospital3 7569**] for acute CHF
exacerbation.
.
Pt initially went to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2188-6-16**] for abdominal
pain, nausea, chills, found to have elevated WBC (14.5),
baseline CKD (Cr 1.65), Calcium 10.5, and Abd CT with
diverticulitis. Was started on Abx (initially Pip/Tazo from
[**Date range (1) 8767**] then CTZ/Metronidazole) and Naproxen for
diverticulitis and developed acute renal failure. Naproxen and
home lasix also stopped on [**6-18**] due to [**Last Name (un) **] on CKD. She was
started on continuous fluids on [**6-18**].  At OSH she developed
weight gain and respiratory worsening thought due to CHF
exacerbation in setting of being off lasix and on IVF. On [**6-20**],
found to have troponin I of 1.68 -> 2.12, CK 95 -> 100. WBC
trended down from 17.7 -> 13.2. No labs slips with Cr sent over
but physician notes with Cr of 2.31 on [**6-18**] and 2.26 on [**6-19**].
She was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for CHF exacerbation and question of
need for cath. Still on CTX/Metronidazole for colitis which
seems to be improving. Immediately prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**],
starting IV nitro gtt, VS at [**Location (un) **] 140s-150s and HR 60s in
Afib with O2 91-93% on RA.
.
Pt reports that she was in normal state of health until
presentation to [**Location (un) **]. At baseline she can walk to get mail
but gets SOB on way back to house. Follows closely with outpt
Cardiologist [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11493**] and reports having ECHO 1 month ago and
stress test in last year (she cannot remember if got
pharmacologic stress but didn't tolerate ETT). She reports that
on [**6-19**] (day prior to transfer) she was getting lots of IVF and
became progressively more SOB to point where SOB with lying flat
and minimal movement. Also noted increased ankle swelling.
Reports her dry weight is 168lbs and that her weight last night
at OSH was 180lbs. No chest pain. No diaphoresis,
light-headedness. Improving abdominal pain from admission but
still with some LLQ pain to palpation. Initially had small
amount of blood in stools but this has cleared. No significant
diarrhea. Feels very weak. Still intermittently nauseated. Last
fever was on [**6-18**].
.
On arrival to CCU, patient feeling short of breath and mildly
nauseated. No other symptoms currently.
.

CARDIAC CATH:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

demonstrated a moderate LMCA disease.  The LMCA had a 60% distal
lesion with moderate calcification.  The LAD was patent with a
patent
previously placed proximal stent.  The LCx was a moderately
calcified
non-dominant vessel and was patent.  The RCA was occluded at its
origin and distal flow was supplied via left to right
collaterals.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right sided
filling pressures with an RVEDP of 22 mmHg and a mean PCWP of 25
mmHg.  The cardiac output was preserved at 2.71 l/min/m2.  There
was a moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with a
PASP of 50 mmHg.  There was a severe central arterial systolic
hypertension with an SBP of 180 mmHg.
3.  Left ventriclulography was deferred given elevated
creatinine.
4.  The LMCA lesion was evaluated with a pressure wire
interrogation.
Baseline FFR was 0.92.  The FFR was 0.76 with maximal hyperemia.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. LMCA and RCA disease.
2. Moderate diastolic left ventricular dysfunction.
3. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
4. Severe systemic arterial systolic hypertension.

EKG: SR, IV conduction delay with left-bundleoid appearance with
possible posterior fascile abnormality, poor b
