Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7881**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

stent
- Pulmonary artery catheter


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 woman with a history of asthma and seasonal
allergies who three weeks ago developed symptoms of a sinus
infection. This was associated with pronounced congestion and
some asthma symptoms such as wheezing and shortness of breath.
Shortly thereafter, she also developed symptoms of acute
gastroenteritis (nausea, vomiting - nonbloody, nonbilious,
diarrhea - nonbloody). She notes that she has had similar
symptoms following past sinus infections. She waited
approximately 1 week before visiting her PCP to discuss these
symptoms. She was started on a Z-pack for the sinus infection,
which she completed. The diarrhea resolved shortly thereafter,
but she has continued to vomit ~ once daily, which is unusual
for her. Recently she has experienced worsening SOB such that
she is unable to walk down stairs or from bedroom to bathroom
without becoming SOB. At baseline, she is SOB with walking
upstairs. These episodes are often associated with wheezing
(typical of her asthma) and chest pressure like "an elephant
sitting on my chest." However, she has had this same sensation
with her asthma for years. When she becomes SOB, she "pushes on"
but then has recently started to become lightheaded.

After hearing that she may have had a past problem with her
heart, she recalls an episode 2-3 weeks ago when she had right
arm pain that was new and severe, but short lived. She often has
aches/pains on her right side since she has had multiple sports
injuries on the right, including rotator cuff repair for
snowmobiling injury 2 years ago. However looking back she
wonders if this pain could have been cardiac. She occasionally
has "random sharp chest pains" with lifting or moving heavy
objects, but has had these symptoms for years.

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. She denies
dysuria or other urinary symptoms. She endorses ankle edema,
which she states is related to prednisone use and correlates
with the amount that she takes. Also endorses "aches and pains"
especially of the right side, related to old sports injuries -
this includes "grinding" in the right knee. Finally, has been
recently having hot flashes and believes she is perimenopausal.
All of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Past Medical History:
- Asthma
- Severe springtime allergies with rhinitis and wheezing
- Obesity
- s/p delayed laproscopic appendectomy age 13

- tubal ligation [**2149**]
- Rotator cuff repair on R [**2154**] (injury to C4-C5 nerve roots ->
chronic pain)
- Exploratory laparoscopy 17 years ago for abdominal pain
(thought to be related to "scar tissue" from appendectomy)
- Cysts on R ovary
- Fracture of R metatarsal in high school


Social History:
Currently unemployed, worked as an accountant. She has two
boyfriends at the moment, one of whom "smokes like a chimney"
providing significant second-hand smoke exposure. She lives
alone. Has significant stressors including related to sister's
murder and the fact that a boyfriend died in bed while sleeping
next to her. Has 6 tattoos.

smoker in youth

Family History:
Mother has type II diabetes and breast cancer 14 years ago.
Details of her father's family history cannot be obtained - he
"went out for milk and never came back" when she was very young.
She believes he is now deceased. No known family history of
early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death.
