Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: Abd pain and fever
Reason for MICU transfer: A. fib with


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PEG tube placement [**2153-6-19**]


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 10680**] is a 76 y/o F with a h/o frontal dementia,
hypothyroidism, and hypertension who was admitted from [**Location (un) 8220**] (lives there as long term care) on [**2153-6-3**] with abdominal
pain and fever. CT of her abdomen/pelvis in the ER were notable
for an SBO and a LLL PNA, she was admitted to ACS for
conservative management of a SBO. Her abdominal pain improved,
she had a BM and ACS said her SBO resolved, they then
transferred her to CC6 on [**2153-6-5**] for management of her pna and
and delirium. She is currently on vanc/cefepime/flagyl for abx
coverage. She is afebrile, only oriented to herself, she is
pulling out her IV's, etc. Her O2 requirement and CXR was
worseing during her [**Hospital1 **] course. On [**2153-6-6**] she triggered at
8:55 for difficulty breathing and HR to 140s in a fib with BPs
of 170s to 90s. Pt noted at that time to be positive 4Ls with
UOP of about 20/Hr of fluid and requiring 2L NC for 88%. 20mg of
IV lasix was given and 5mg of metoprolol iv which she diuressed.
Throughout the day she had occasional a fib with SBPs in the
160-170s and triggered an additional two times. She was given
20+20+40 IV lasix, 5+5 of metoprolol and 25 of PO metoprolol
Q8Hr. Then she continued to be in A. fib with RVR to the
150-160s and was transferred to the MICU.

Past Medical History:
- Dementia, Hypertension, Hypothryroid, Latent syphilis,
depression, Osteoarthritis
- Bilateral knee replacement in [**2140**]


Social History:
The patient quit smoking 30 years ago, does not drink alcohol.
No recreational drugs, no transfusions.  Stopped working more
than ten years ago.

Family History:
Two brothers and two sisters, one of which died of old age.  The
living siblings have dementia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus
and a stroke.  Five children, one with asthma, three with
hypertension.

movements apparent under closed lids. When eyes are forced open
she does resist, with positive Bells phenomenon. No clear
neglect, as she
attends to her daughter on either side.

MOTOR: paratonia more on the left side. Bilateral hand tremor
while at rest, R>L that is not suppressible.
LUE spontaneous antigravity and purposeful (tries to grab my
hand while pinching her).
RUE not moving as much as left and not as purposeful, withdraws
very briskly and antigravity to pinch.
LLE is externally rotated and paratonic. Both LEs withdraw
briskly to Babinski testing.
Sensation intact to pinch throughout.
DTR: 2+ UEs, 0 patellars (s/p TKR), no clonus, L toe upgoing at
baseline with positive Babinski response, R toe equivocal.

DISCHARGE EXAM:
GENERAL EXAM: mildly tenderness to palpation on abdominal exam,
otherwise comfortable, NAD.

NEURO:
MSE: opens eyes briefly to voice, and the keeps it closed for
the rest of the exam. does not follow commands.
CN: PERRL 4->2mm bilaterally, right nasolabial flattening
MOTOR: paratonia on L side, also increased tone on right side.
LUE spontaneous antigravity and purposeful movements. RUE
withdraws with antigravity strength in elbow, some spontaneous
movements but less than left side. Both [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 43829**] to noxious
stimuli.
Reflexes: hyperreflexic in RUE, positive babinski bilaterally.

IMAGING:
[**2153-6-3**] CT ABD/PELVIS:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Findings consistent with small-bowel obstruction with a
transition point in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen.
2.  Left lower lobe pneumonia.
3.  Extensive lumbar spine degenerative changes with compression
of L1
vertebral body, acuity unknown.
4.  Healing right-sided rib fractures.

[**2153-6-8**] ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 65%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2153-6-8**] HEAD CT:
1.  No evidence of acute vascular territorial infarction.  In
the setting of high clinical suspicion for acute ischemia, MRI
with diffusion sequences can be considered for further
assessment.

[**2153-6-15**] HEAD CT:
1.  Low-attenuating region within the left corona radiata
extending into the left caudate head and possibly the left
putamen appears better evolved than [**2153-6-8**] and is concerning
for subacute infarction.
2.  Lacunes in the left striatocapsular region are unchanged
since the prior examination.
3.  Left maxillary sinus disease.

[**2153-6-8**] MRI HEAD:
IMPRESSION:
1.  Extensive relatively acute infarction involving the left
deep [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter structures, including the caudate and lentiform
nuclei, likely accounting for the acute presentation.
2.  Numerous additional more punctate infarcts scattered
throughout both cerebral hemispheres, including in the posterior
circulation territory.  The overall appear
