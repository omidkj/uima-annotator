Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
 The patient is an 82-year-old male with history of CAD, s/p MI
in [**2187**], CHF w/ EF 10-15% who had a recent admission to
[**Hospital 16843**] hospital for CHF exacerbation. He was discharged 1
week prior to this admission on [**2199-9-22**]. The patient has been
complaining of shortness of breath since his last
hospitalization. He reports new exertional dyspnea after walking
just "10 feet" and he has [**1-13**] pillow orthopnea and needs to
sleep upright on occasion. No new lower extremity swelling and
he reports weight loss of 15lbs over the last 2-3 months. Has
has a "constant cough" with white/green phlegm but no blood. No
sick contacts. [**Name (NI) **] recent travel. By report from family patient's
lasix dose was recently decreased by his home visiting
nurses/CNAs due to low blood pressures. Previously had been
taking 60mg [**Hospital1 **] and now was taking 40-60mg daily (unclear,
patient limited historian and daughter uncertain).

Patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital a week ago where
he was treated for a CHF exacerbation. 2D Echo done at [**Hospital **]demonstrated an EF of 10% w/ severe global LV
hypokinesis, pulmonary HTN, and severe aortic stenosis. BNP was
elevated to 5,000, Troponin I of 0.05. Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 75012**] was diuresed
1.5L but fluid removal was limited by hypotension. The [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course was further complicated by acute on chronic
renal failure with Cr 1.7, and by recurrent NSVT. He was started
on amiodarone infusion at OSH. Impression from cardiology was
for re-stenosis of stents placed in [**2199-2-9**] and he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization and EP consult
for discussion of possible upgrade of ICD to BivPM.
.
In the cath lab, RHC demonstrated CI 1.78, PCWP 28, RA pressure
of 5, PAP of 34. LHC demonstrated LM w/ obstruction, LCX with
proximal TO, RCA and LAD with minimal disease. Were unable to
cross the LCx w/ wire. Felt to be a CTO. Post-procedure patient
was hypotensive to upper 70's low 80's. Baseline BP 80-90's.
Also with brief episode of chest pain post procedure (no EKG
changes). Transferred to CCU for further management.
.
On arrival in CCU, patient was chest pain free and otherwise had
complaints of mild dyspnea. No complaints of dizziness, back
pain, groin pain, or leg pain.
.

Past Medical History:
CAD with MI in [**2187**], underwent angiogram at [**Hospital1 498**] (no stent
placed)
ICD placement in [**2193**] at [**Hospital6 15083**]
Prostate Cancer, no intervention, "slow growing" per patient
HTN
Nephrolithiasis
Gout
h/o pancreatic duct obstruction
Borderline Diabetes, diet controlled
Acute on Chronic Kidney Disease


Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. Past tobacco use over 50years ago. There is no history of
alcohol abuse or drug abuse per patient. Patient is a retired
firefighter and is currently still very active working with
lumber. He ambulates 2 flights of stairs easily.


Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death. Father lived to be [**Age over 90 **] years old.

delay, no ST T changes. One EKG with no discernable p-waves and
atrial fibrillation .

[**2199-9-21**] 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: The left atrium is moderately
dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15-20 %) with global
hypokinesis. The inferior and infero-lateral walls are thinned
and akinetic. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. There is mild global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Significant aortic stenosis is present
(not quantified). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**12-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, the patient is an 82yo male with longstanding
history of CHF with poor EF of [**9-25**]%, severe aortic stenosis
and CAD who was transferred from OSH for evaluation of
progression of CHF and question of in-stent re-stenosis. He
underwent cardiac catheterization which showed CTO of LCX and no
other acute lesions. He had complication post-procedure for
hypotension and he was transferred to the CCU.
.
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE /NSTEMI: The patient had a prior CABG,
an MI in [**2187**] and a PCI 6 months ago at OSH. He also has
advanced COPD and he has had several CHF episodes in the recent
past. The patient had CTO of LCX but otherwise no obstructive
disease was noted on his cardiac catheterization. He initially
had no elevation in his CK level and a mild increase in his
troponin which was attributed to his worsening renal function.
Unfortunately, however, his CK trended up from 469 to 726
post-catheterization and MB-I went up to 22.3 from 19.8 and
troponins increased from .75 to 1.47 on [**2199-9-21**]. He had some
T-wave changes suggesting ischemia and a possible NSTEMI on EKG.
Follow-up EKG later in the evening after admi
