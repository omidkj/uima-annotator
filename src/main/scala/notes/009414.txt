History of Present Illness:
082 y/o F w/Sjogren's syndrome s/p numerous prolonged
hospitalizations at [**Hospital1 18**] earlier this year for GI bleed, pelvic
abscess, complicated by hemoptysis, resp failure req trach,
CDiff, adrenal insufficiency, anemia, ARF requiring HD, DVT,
acute proliferative glomerulonephritis, transferred to [**Hospital1 **]
[**2177-5-12**] for further management.  Had a very long vent wean at
[**Hospital1 **] but was doing well until 2 days ago, developed resp
distress requiring increased ventilatory support, increasing
secretions from trach, weight increased approx 10 pounds over 2
weeks and increased FiO2 requirement overnight.  Blood cx from
[**2177-8-3**] grew gram negative rods 2/4 bottles, sputum cx [**2177-8-2**]
grew 2 different species of pseudomonas.  CXR at [**Hospital1 **] showed
RLL infiltrate vs atelectasis.  Her WBC increased from 12 to 29,
her creatinine increased to 2.2 from 1.8.  Her FiO2 requirement
increased from 40% to 100%, and her ABG on the Fio2 of 100 was
7.34/45/102.  She received vanc for increasing secretions and
resp distress, aztreonam 500 mg x1, gent 5 mg/kg x1 for GNR
bacteremia.

In the ED, she was afebrile (98.8) and hemodynamically stable
(bp 140s, tachy in 100s).  Her FiO2 was at 70%.  She was noted
to have acute renal failure at 1.8 (but 2.0 at [**Hospital1 **]), and
was hyperkalemic at 6.3.  She was given insulin/glucose, bicarb,
and kayexalate and transferred to the MICU.

Past Medical History:

bilateral pneumothoraces, s/p chest tube placement, s/p talc
pleurodesis.  s/p trach, has been off vent x3 weeks, placed back
on it 2 days ago
2. Sjogren's
3. Glomerulonephritis, proliferative.  Rx with prednisone and
cytoxan, required HD [**2-5**].

7. GI bleed adm early [**2-5**]: gastritis, esophagitis on EGD,
proctitis with erythema and small ulcers, diverticulosis on
colonoscopy.  Readmitted with GI bleed later that month,
underwent left colectomy, appy, colorectal anastomosis, and
gastrostomy.
8. Pelvic abscess, adm [**3-8**], s/p drainage by surgery.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Resp failure:  The etiology of this was felt to be a
combination of pseudomonal pneumonia plus pulmonary edema.  ID
was consulted who recommended treating the pseudmonas with
meropenem since it was sensitive, and because it was sensitive
she did not need to be double dovered.  She was also diuresed
with lasix as tolerated.  She also had a pleural effusion that
was very small (history of talc pleurodesis due to pleural
effusion).  An ultrasound was done to evaluate the effusion but
it appeared to be too small to tap.  She was also given a dose
of vancomycin in the ED because of the degree of her illness.
She was on AC ventilator setting for most of her hospital stay,
but over the past 2-3 days she has tolerated CPAP+PS (PS 10,
PEEP 5) and short sprints (2-3 hours) on trach collar.

2. Bacteremia:  She grew pseudomonas from her blood at [**Hospital1 **],
and the most likely source was felt to be her Quinton catheter
given that it had been in for over 6 months.  This was removed
by surgery on [**8-5**], although the tip culture was negative. She
was covered with meropenem 500 IV q12h, and was started on
gentamicin before the sensitivities from [**Hospital1 **] were received
which revealed 2 strains of Pseudomonas, one of which was
resistant to gentamicin. Gentamicin was then stopped and she was
continued on Meropenem.  She remained afebrile and her
leukocytosis improved.  Her blood pressure remained elevated
throughout her hospital course.

3. Renal failure: Had extensive w/u in the past, biopsy
consistent with glomerulonephritis, treated with prednisone and
cytoxan.  Her creatinine was elevated on admission but trended
down to 1.1 by discharge.  This was felt to be due to
intravascular volume depletion.  Her ACEi was held given her
elevated creatinine.

4. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: She has a history of chronic anemia
and required numerous transfusions as well
