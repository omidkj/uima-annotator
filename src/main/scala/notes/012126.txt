History of Present Illness:
72 year old female with an extensive smoking history presents
with one day of intermittent left chest pain and worsening
shortness of breath.  Was comfortable when EMS arrived, but on
transport, her breath sounds became less clear with crackles to
the mid lung fields and she became tachypneic. Was given 6
sprays of NG, 40mg of Lasix, 4mg of morphine and put on BiPaP.
Highest SBP is reported but not documented at 180. While on
BiPaP she was tachypneic to 32-40. She admits to eating some
sausage today prior to feeling short of breath. Also, she visits
her husband at a long term care facility and said that many
people had "colds" there. She has had chills, and developed a
cough, but did not measure her temperature.

Sinus rhythm. There is slurring of the upstroke of the QRS
complex consistent with pre-excitation. Compared to the previous
tracing voltage for left ventricular hypertrophy is slightly
less.

COMMENTS:     1.  Coronary angiography in this right dominant
system

angiographically
apparent disease.   The LAD had a 80% proximal stenosis.  THe
LCx had
minimal diffuse disease.  The RCA had a 90% stenosis in the
mid-portion.

CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2146-10-24**]

pulmonary edema.
Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
Minimally
increased pulmonary vasculature and blunting of the costophrenic
angles
remain. No focal consolidation or pneumothorax. There are low
lung volumes.
IMPRESSION:
1. Marked interval improvement in pulmonary edema.

PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:

REASON FOR EXAM: Status post AVR and MVR repair and CABG.

Comparison is made with prior studies [**10-30**].

Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Now mild to moderate pulmonary
edema has
markedly improved. Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions
are
decreased associated with adjacent atelectasis. Left PICC tip is
in the upper
to mid SVC. Sternal wires are aligned.


Brief Hospital Course:
Presented to emergency department tachypneic to 32-40 while on
BiPaP and  hypotension.  She was admitted and transferred to the
CCU at which time she was chest pain free; vitals on transfer to
the CCU T 98.0, HR 83, BP 105/63, RR 30, 100% on bipap. She was
actively diuresed and put out over 4L with significant
improvment in pulmonary edema seen on CXR and concomitant
improvement in respiratory status. Given severity of AS and
resent exacerbation, pt was evaluated for AVR and felt to need
valve replacement. Pre-op work-up intiated and she underwent
repeat CXR, carotid ultrasound and cardiac catheterization.
Cardiac catheterization revealed coronary artery disease.

On [**2146-10-25**] she was brought to the operating room and underwent
aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass graft
surgery.  She received vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics
and was trasnfered to the intensive care unit for post operative
management.  She remained intubated, as she remained lethargic
and unable to protect airway.  She was transfused two units of
packed red blood cells for anemia due to blood loss and
hemodilution.  She was extubated on POD 3, by this time she had
been weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support.  Beta
blocker was initiated and she was gently diuresed toward the
preoperativ
