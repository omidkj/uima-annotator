Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia, increased secretions

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
J-tube reinsertion
central venous catheter insertion

History of Present Illness:
67 YO M w complicated surgical history after a distant
esophageal resection for esophageal Ca c/b TEF and recurrent
PNAs requiring chronic trach/intermittent vent and j-tube who
presented with increased secretions and hypoxia. The patient is
not able to provide history so information was obtained from his
daughter and medical records. The patient was in his usual state
of health, living in a chronic vent facility, on [**4-14**]. On the
evening of [**4-15**], while off the vent, he was noted to have
shortness of breath with a large amount of secretions. He was
hypoxic and was placed back on the vent. On the morning of [**4-16**],
he was noted to be restless with SBPs in the 70s-80s with
minimal response to IVF boluses. He was therefore given cefepime
and vanc and sent to the ED.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, VS were: 98, 83/64, 22, 97% on AC with
FiO2 60%, VT 500, RR 12, peep 5. He was noted to be comfortable.
RT suctioned thick yellow secretions. Labs were notable for
bandemia 7% and hct 22. CXR was c/f multifocal pneumonia. He was
started on levophed.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, he is unable to provide any further
history. He denies pain or shortness of breath.

IMAGING:
[**2120-4-16**] CXR: Tracheostomy tube remains in unchanged position.
Surgical clips are noted projecting over the left mediastinum as
well as left upper quadrant of the abdomen. There are
ill-defined opacities within both lung bases, predominantly
involving the right upper lobe as well as the left upper lobe
concerning for multifocal pneumonia, which appear progressed
when compared to the prior study. There is likely an element of
mild pulmonary edema as the pulmonary vasculature is somewhat
indistinct and there is mild perihilar haziness. Small bilateral
pleural effusions are likely present, but not completely imaged
on this exam. Old left-sided rib fractures are noted.

[**2120-4-19**] CXR: No appreciable change is demonstrated as compared
to the prior study in the location of the tracheostomy, right
internal jugular line as well as the mediastinal contours and
widespread parenchymal consolidations, pleural effusions, and
lungs hyperexpansion. No interval development of pneumothorax
has been noted.
.
[**2120-4-19**] Abdominal XR with gastrograffin: J-tube in place; no
leakage.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 year old man with a distant esophageal resection for
esophageal Ca c/b TE fistula and recurrent pneumonias requiring
chronic trach/intermittent vent and j-tube who presented with
increased secretions and hypoxia.
.
# Increased secretions, hypoxia, bandemia, hypotension
suggestive of SIRS [**3-6**] pneumonia. He was initially started on
levophed for hypotension. He was weaned off of this almost
immediately with the aid of fluid boluses. He was started on
vancomycin and cefepime for hospital acquired pneumonia. Sputum
cultures grew gram negative rods. Blood culture grew
corynebacterium in one bottle, which was thought to be a
contaminant. Urine culture was negative. He has been afebrile
and his leukocytosis is resolving. He will be treated with a
10-day course of the vanc/cefepime for healthcare associated
pneumonia, to be completed on [**2120-4-25**].
