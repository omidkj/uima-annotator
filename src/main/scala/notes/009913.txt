[**2161-10-19**] Liver US :
1. Findings concerning for acute cholecystitis.
2. Diffusely echogenic liver without focal lesion, most
compatible with
diffuse fatty infiltration. Other forms of advanced liver
disease including fibrosis or cirrhosis cannot be excluded.

1. Bibasilar atelectasis vs. consolidation, correlate
clinically.
2. Findings consistent with previously known diagnosis of acute
cholecystitis, this appears uncomplicated.
3. Splenosis.

degenerative disc disease.

[**2161-10-26**] CT Torso :

1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus, bibasilar consolidation
versus collapse, correlation is necessary to discern between the
two.
2. Extensive coronary artery and aortic calcification.
3. Diffusely dilated esophagus, stomach, and large and small
bowel, most
consistent with a postoperative ileus. There is an abrupt
transition in bowel caliber involving the distal sigmoid colon,
which was present on the prior study, no mass lesion is seen;
however, given its unchanged appearance on two
CT scans, a stricture should be considered.
4. Postoperative changes and surgical drain in this patient is
apparently
status post cholecystectomy.
5. Remaining findings such as splenosis, degenerative changes,
radiopaque
foreign densities are all unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 29179**] was evaluated by the Acute Care service in the
Emergency Room and based on his physical exam, lab data and
Abdominal CT scan he was admitted to the hospital for treatment
of acute cholecystitis.  Due to his multiple co morbidities he
underwent percutaneous drainage of the gallbladder on [**2161-10-20**].
He tolerated the procedure well and returned to the Surgical
floor with a drain in place and on broad spectrum IV
antibiotics. He did well and was tolerating a regular diet with
plans to be discharged with his drain in place.

Unfortunately he developed hypotension and oxygen desaturation
on [**2161-10-22**] prompting transfer to the Surgical ICU for
resuscitation as he appeared in septic shock.  His
cholecystotomy tube was no longer draining.  He was taken to the
Operating Room after his hemodynamics were stable and he
underwent an open subtotal cholecystectomy.  He tolerated that
procedure well and returned to the ICU in stable condition.  He
maintained stable hemodynamics and his pain was well controlled.

He was transferred to the Surgical floor the following day and
gradually started a liquid diet.  His abdominal incision was
healing well but his abdomen was a bit distended therefore his
oral intake was limited.  The JP drain was draining clear fluid.
 Over the next few days he developed intermittent respiratory
issues with bronchospasm and increased secretions. He underwent
vigorous pulmonary toilet including Chest PT, nebulizers and
incentive spirometry but had only transient improvement.  His
chest xray showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates vs.
atelectasis and on [**2161-10-26**] he had an episode of desaturation
and altered mental status.

As he transfe
