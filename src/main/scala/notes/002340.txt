SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
80 y/o female with h/o MDS transformed to AML tranferred from
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] following an admission for SOB.
.
Presented to the ER [**8-14**] with SOB. Patient was found to have a BP
of 220/80. She was given 40mg PO lasix and [**12-11**] inch of
nitropaste, which quickly brought her BP down to 100/50. Her VS
at the time were notable for a temp 97.8, HR 96, and a RR of 44
(O2 sats were not documented). She then became tachycardic, with
a HR of 136. She was given 0.5mg ativan PO for anxiety which
then caused her BP to drop further to 80s/50s. Her pulse
gradually slowed, down to 96 and then down to 62. However, her
BP remained 80s/50s. Ms. [**Known lastname 60949**] appeared diaphoretic and
continued to be tachypneic, with RR in the 40s. O2 sats dipped
down to 86% but then came up to 94% on 6L O2.
.
In the ER, no temp was checked, but pt was 89% on RA on arrival,
with a RR of 18. Sats improved to 93-94% on 3L by nc (is on 2L
at home). BP was 84-129/40-58 and HR 62. Her PAC was accessed
for blood draw. She was given lasix 40mg IV x1 and a foley was
placed to monitor UOP. She was also started on a nitro gtt at
10mcg/min. She was started on BiPAP with improvement in her
tachypnea. By the time she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], her BP
was in the 120s/80s and her RR was 17.
.
Of note, the pt's functional status has been slowly declining
over the recent months. Per her daughter, the patient has even
mentioned stopping transfusions at times because they seem to be
causing her to develop more episodes of CHF. At her baseline the
patient can walk a few steps with a walker but must stop [**1-11**]
fatigue and dyspnea. She is essentially limited to movements in
her room at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab (gets up to commode, up to the chair,
etc).
.
in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] the patient was briefly on BIPAP and then weaned to
NC. She was given lasix for presumed CHF flare. When she was
stable off BIPAP she was transferred to the floor for further
management.


Past Medical History:
Past Medical History:
Onc history: Mrs. [**Known lastname 60949**] was diagnosed with MDS
in [**2169-9-9**] after a greater than 6 year history of anemia
treated with iron supplementation. In [**7-14**] [**Known firstname **] became more
fatigued and irritable and was noted to be pancytopenic.  Bone
marrow biopsy at that time showed: hypercellular for age bone
marrow erythroid hyperplasia, moderately dysplastic
granulopoiesis, mildly increased myeloblasts, megaloblastic and
dysplastic erythropoiesis, abundant megakaryocytes wtih frequent
small hypolobate dysplastic forms, decreased stainable iron, no
ring sideroblasts seen, and mild to focally moderatley increased
bone marrow reticulin. Her biopsy and aspirate were consistent
with a myelodysplatic disorder. Cytogenetics show multiple
abnormalities including a deletion of the long arm of chromosome
5 and trisomy 8. She has been receiving blood product support
now
for several months requiring transfusions 1-3 times weekly of 1
bag of platelets and [**12-11**] units PRBC. She last received blood
products on [**2170-7-20**] of 1 bag of platelets.

[**2170-8-14**] CXR - A pacemaker overlies the left chest, with leads
overlying right atrium and right ventricle. There is a right
internal jugular central venous catheter in place, with the tip
in the proximal right atrium. The cardiac and mediastinal
contours are unchanged, with aortic calcifications.
Moderate-to-severe congestive failure persists. There is likely
a left effusion. No pneumothorax.  IMPRESSION: Persistent
moderate-to-severe congestive failure. An underlying pneumonia
cannot be excluded

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo f with MDS recently tranformed to leukemia presented from
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab after acute onset SOB likely due to CHF
exacerbation with possible PNA as well.
.
On admission the patient had evidence of volume overload on CXR
an on exam. However, PNA couldn't be excluded either. It was
thought that there may also have been a component of
leukocytosis contributing to her resp distress as well given her
CBC showing 80% blasts. The patient's SOB was very responsive to
nitropaste so she was started on 1 inch q6h with good effect.
She was also given lasix IV boluses as needed for SOB. For her
possible leukocytosis she was given hydrea, 500mg x1 and 1000mg
x1. Although she responded to diuresis, given her refractory
leukemia she remained transfusion dependent and unfortunately
with transfusion would become overloaded with worsening
respiratory status.  She continued to complain of SOB and she
began to require morphine IV to make her breathing more
comfortable.  She was continued on Nitropaste and given morphine
as needed for comfort.  When it became clear that the patient
would continue to require more and more transfusion support and
her respiratory status was not improving, a family meeting was
arranged to discuss the goals of care.  She had elected not to
pursue any aggressive treatment up to this point.  It was
explained to the patient and the family that the patient would
continue to need transfusion support which would likely worsen
the patient's respiratory status and make it difficult for her
to return to
