Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
NSTEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 68 yo man with h/o CAD s/p CABG in [**2158**], who
presented with 12 hour history of chest pain and was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.  The patient states that
he began to experience chest pain last night at approximately 5
PM, when he was laying in bed.  The pain was an [**7-20**],
substernal, non-radiating sharp pain.  He also experienced
associated shortness of breath and nausea.  The patient states
that he believes he lost consciousness after this event and then
woke up multiple times throughout the night with similar chest
pain.  When he woke up this morning at 5 am, he continued to
experience the pain, so he called EMS.  He was found to have a
FSBG of 46.  He was then brought to [**Hospital 26580**] Hospital for further
evaluation.
.
In the ED, his VS were T 98.7, P 101, R 24, BP 124/99, O2 97% on
RA.  He had an ECG which showed ST depressions in II, III, AVF,
V4-V6 and TWIs in V4-V6.  Cardiac enzymes were drawn and were
found to be elevated (CK [**2100**], TroponinI 60.83).  He was given
ASA 325 mg, Plavix 300 mg, Zofran for nausea, and was started on
heparin gtt.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization.
.
In the cath lab, the patient was found to have known severe 3VD.
 His LIMA-LAD graft was patent but had moderate diffuse disease
and distal collaterals.  His other three SV grafts were all
occluded at the origins, and one of the OM grafts appeared to be
newly occluded.  It was thus decided that the patient would
undergo medical management of his CAD.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient is no longer experiencing
chest pain.  He states that he is short of breath and has a
productive cough, which has been present for the past three
days.  Of note, the patient states that he also lost
consciousness five days ago while at home and believes that his
shortness of breath began at this time.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations,
syncope or presyncope.  He does endorse a recent increase in his
peripheral edema (2 months).

CARDIAC CATH ([**2167-6-24**]):
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated three
vessel disease. THe LMCA had diffuse disease on angiographical
examination. The LAD had a total occlusion at the origin on
angiography.
The Cx had a total occlusion at the origin on angiography. The
Ramus had
an 80% occlusion at the origin on angiography and also had
diffuse
disease throughout. The RCA had a 100% occlusion in the mid
portion of
the vessel on angiography.
2. Arterial condui angiography revealed the LIMA to be widely
patent and
if feeds the LAD which subsequent [**Last Name (un) 36**] collaterals to the RCA
and the
Cx. On angiography of the LIMA, moderate diffuse disease of the
LAD was
noted. All three SVG grafts are occluded at the origin with
thrombus
present within one of the vein grafts.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures with an RVEDP of 13 mmHg and a PCWP of 28 mmHg.  There
was
severe pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension with PASP of 72
mmHg.
The Cardiac index was low at 1.7 l/min/m2. Central aortic
pressure was
109/74 mmHg. The SVR was increased at 1624 dynes-sec/cm5 and the
PVR was
increased at 447 dynes-sec/cm5.

TTE ([**2167-6-25**]):  The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior, lateral, septal
and apical akinesis. There is moderate hypokinesis of the
remaining segments (LVEF = 15-20%). No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. There are filamentous strands on
the aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal
variant). The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 year old male with history of CABG in [**2158**] presents with
NSTEMI s/p cardiac cath. No intervention could be done, so
patient will continue with medical management.

# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: The patient initially presented with
a 12 hour history of chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes, and
ST depressions in the inferior leads and V2-V4.  On cardiac
cath, he was found to have occluded SV grafts to the OMs, and
one of the grafts appeared to be acutely thrombosed.  He is not
a surgical or PCI candidate, and it was determined that he will
