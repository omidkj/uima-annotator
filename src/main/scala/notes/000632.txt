Severe back pain

History of Present Illness:
47F with breast cancer metastatic to bone, breast, and lung,
status post multiple rounds of chemotherapy complicated by
herceptin-induced cardiomyopathy with Serratia
hypotension/sepsis.  Patient presented to the Emergency
department with severe back pain unlike previous back pain due
to metastatic lesions, refractory to Vicodin.  As patient was
being worked up in ED for spinal cord compression, patient
became extremely hypotensive to systolic blood pressures to
70s-80s. Patient was administered 4 liters of IV fluid bolus and
was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she was maintained on Levophed
and Vasopressin with SBP in 100s (MAPs 58-83). Patient was felt
to be in bacterial sepsis and empirically started on vancomycin
and ceftriaxone which was later changed to ceftazidime and
ciprofloxacin when blood cultures were positive for gram
negative rods X [**3-1**].

Patient denies previous history of sepsis, has never been on
TPN, has no history of urinary tract infections, and has had
this porta cath since [**2179-4-27**]. In addition, patient complains
of history of loss of right hand dexterity over the last year,
with tingling in the fingertips of both hands, which she feels
started when she began taking Decadron. Otherwise, she denies
any asymmetric weakness or paresthesias.

Past Medical History:
1) Pulmonary embolism [**2180-6-27**], anticoagulated on Coumadin
(target INR [**2-29**])
2) Breast Cancer
3) Hypertension
4) Depression
5) S/P tonsilectomy
6) Cardiomyopathy due to Herceptin toxicity - Ejection fraction

      SERRATIA MARCESCENS.    FINAL SENSITIVITIES.
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy..
         Therefore, isolates that are initially susceptible may
become
         resistant within three to four days after initiation of
therapy.
         For serious infections, repeat culture and sensitivity
testing may
         therefore be warranted if third generation
cephalosporins were
         used.

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2180-10-8**]):
      MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT
WITH SKIN
      AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION.
Radiology Reports:
MRI Spine:
1. Findings indicative of metastatic focus in L2 vertebra
described by the recent bone scan of [**2180-8-2**].
2. Heterogeneous marrow signal in L1 vertebra indicative of
previous history of metastasis to this area.
3. No acute compression fracture or area of new pathologic
fracture.
4. No evidence of high grade thecal sac compression, or
compression of the distal spinal cord.
---
Chest X-Ray:
FINDINGS: Lung volumes are low. The heart size and pulmonary
vasculature are within normal limits. A Port-A-Cath device has
its tip in the central most SVC. There are no pleural effusions.
The previously identified right lower lobe mass lesion is again
identified and unchanged. There is overall no significant change
from the previous exam. The lungs are clear without evidence of
consolidation.

IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
47F with metastatic breast cancer and herceptin-induced
cardiomyopathy, now with Serratia hypotension/sepsis.

1) Sepsis: Patient had porta-cath removed by general surgery on
hospital day 2, and was weaned off pressors by hospital day 3.
Wound culture and gram stain yielded no organisms.  Tip culture
was not performed.  By hospital day 4, blood cultures speciated
Serratia with a high possibility of developing resistance to
third generation cephalosporins, and so antibiotics were changed
to ciprofloxacin and cefepime, and vancomycin was discontinued.
Patient continued to be hemodynamically stable without pressor
support, was afebrile, in no acute pain and was felt to be
stable for the floor on hospital day 4.

Infectious disease was briefly consulted with regard to the
organism and treatment course.  Consultants
