Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2154-12-24**] 1.Coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with left internal
    mammary artery, left anterior descending coronary;
    reverse saphenous vein single graft from aorta to first
    obtuse marginal coronary artery; reverse saphenous vein
    single graft from aorta to the distal right coronary
    artery.
2. Bilateral pulmonary vein isolation using the [**Company 1543**]
    BP2 irrigated bipolar RF system with resection of left
    atrial appendage.
3. Endoscopic left greater saphenous vein harvesting.

History of Present Illness:
83yo man admitted to [**Hospital6 10443**] 6 days prior to transfer with dyspnea on exertion. He
had history of COPD and was presumed to be having COPD
exacerbation. CT revealed effusion and the patient had
thoracentesis. He also had stress test that showed normal
perfusion w/o defects. Following the stress test he develped
chest pain and had ST depression in V2-6. During this episode
the
patient was noted to be in atrial fibrillation. He had cardiac
catheterization today that revealed 3VD with preserved EF.
Referred for surgery.

Pertinent Results:
Conclusions
PRE BYPASS The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results in the operating
room at the time of the study.

POST BYPASS The patient is being a paced. There is normal
biventricular systolic function. The left atrial appendage has
been resected. There is mild to moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Other valvular function is unchanged from the
pre-bypass study. The thoracic aorta is intact s/p
decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 30620**] was admitted on [**12-16**] from an outside hospital and
his pre-op work-up was done. Over the next several days he was
diuresed and had thoracentesis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a pleural
effusion. He also had a plavix washout. Antibiotics also were
started as well as BP med titration. He underwent coronary
artery bypass, MAZE, and left atrial appendage ligation with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] on [**12-24**] and was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition on phenylephrine and propofol drips. He extubated
later that day and remained in the CVICU over the next few days
for aggressive pulmonary conditioning. His atrial fibrillation
returned and he was treated with amiodarone. A renal consult was
requested for acute renal failure with highest creat 3.8. He
also had an ileus but was ultimately transferred to the floor on
POD #6 to begin increasing his activity level. His beta blockade
was titrated.  Coumadin was not started for atrial fibrillation
per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] [**Name (STitle) 88067**] to fall risk.  By post-operative day
nince he was ready for discharge to rehab per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**].  All
follow-up appointments were advised.
