History of Present Illness:
39 yo F h/o asthma, tracheobronchomalacia s/p y stent [**2119-6-22**]
and anxiety here with tachypnea. Was recently hospitalized which
required intubation on [**7-14**]/12 for worsening

Past Medical History:
1. Asthma, multiple prior intubations
2. Tracheobronchomalacia, diagnosed on CT trachea [**2119-6-7**]
3. Possible inflammatory lung process such as hypersensitivity
pneumonitis. (Had open lung biopsy in [**10/2118**] which was reviewed

by [**Hospital1 18**] pathologists and showed undefined inflammatory process
superimposed on normal lung,and poorly formed granulomas that
seemed to be consistent with a hypersensitivity pneumonitis).
Most recent CT trachea showed no evidence of hypersensitity
pneumonitis.
4. History of positive PPD (the patient reports that it was
borderline degree of induration for many years and has not
received INH. She states the reason for no INH was a clear CXR
5. PCOS

8. Status post multiple colposcopies and cervical LEEP procedure

9. Meningitis in [**2118-12-11**]

asbestos exposure according to the patient as she was a
volunteer firefighter in the past. History of positive PPD. Has
a dog, cat, a lizard and a hamster at home.

CXR: FINDINGS:  The lungs appear clear.  The cardiomediastinal
silhouette and hilar contours are unremarkable. No pleural
effusion or pneumothorax.

IP Rigid Bronch
Procedure: The procedure, indications, preparation and potential
complications were explained to the patient, who indicated her
understanding and signed the corresponding consent forms. A
standard time out was performed as per protocol. The procedure
was performed for diagnostic purposes at the operating room. A
physical exam was performed. The bronchoscope was introduced
through an endotracheal tube and advanced under direct
visualization until the tracheobronchial tree was reached.The
procedure was not difficult. The quality of the preparation was
good. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no
complications.

other findings: Following general anesthesia a yellow Dumon
rigid tracheoscope was inserted with slight difficulty. The
airway was examined with flexible bronchoscopy, there was
minimal secretion in the stent, the distal airways were patent.
Using rigid forceps the Dumon Y stent was removed. The airway
was again examined, there was no granulation tissue, except a
small rim at the distal end of the LMS limb of the Y stent.

Impression: Severe Trachchiobronchomalacia
Removal of Dumon Y stent with rigid forceps through a Rigid
tracheoscope.

Recommendations: Admit to ICU
Will follow as inpatient

Additional notes: Patient medication list was reconciled.
Attending was present for the entire procedure. FINAL DIAGNOSES
are listed in the impression section above. Estimated blood loss
= zero. No specimens were taken for pathology.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 92011**] is a 39 woman who presents with shortness of breath x
2d, periodic hemoptysis with coughing since [**2119-6-27**]. Hx
signficant for severe asthma, severe tracheobronchomalacia with
air trapping treated with y stent on [**2119-6-22**]. She had her Y
stent removed on [**2119-6-28**].

#Tracheobroncheomalacia: pt has a h/o tracheomalacia s/p y stent
placement with IP on [**2119-6-22**] for worsening TCM which required
hospitalization from [**Date range (1) 40836**] where pt required intubation. Due
to recent placement of stent, this is most likely the cause of
tachypnea and hemoptysis. Does have a h/o asthma requiring
multiple intubations, but this does not seem likely to be an
asthmatic exacerbation. Per pt, on MTX for sarcoidosis and this
was held during hospitalization. Bronchoscopy was done on [**6-28**]
with interventional pulmonology. Pt was tachypneic and
distressed after bronch, and anxiety and coughing paroxysms
could only be controlled with precedex drip initially. During
this time, pt was still accepting lidocaine, albuterol and
ipratropium nebs with morphine and benzodiazepines to control
anxiety with coughing episodes. Anxiety and coughing paroxysms
would worsen to the point where pt received multiple PRN doses
of Ativan, morphine, Haldol and heliox. Of note, pt would not
desaturate during coughing episodes. Throughout hospitalization,
pt continued her home inhaled corticosteroids and oral asthma
medications. Interventional pulmonology followed patient while
in house and could not suggest other stents. Only BiPAP was
recommended which patient refused on multiple occasions. CT
surgery also assessed pt and found her to not be a good surgical
candidate for tracheoplasty. Towards the end of her MICU course,
the pt was transitioned off of the precedex drip to a low-dose
of clonidine and Zyprexa [**Hospital1 *
