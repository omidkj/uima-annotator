Radiology:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2198-9-7**] 12:18 PM
IMPRESSION: Mild central vascular congestion without overt
failure.
Bibasilar atelectasis. Increased opacity of the retrocardiac
left lower lobe may reflect underlying pneumonia or aspiration.
Correlate clinically.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2198-9-7**] 12:34 PM
LUNG BASES: There is consolidation and ground-glass
opacification of the
superior segment of the left lower lobe, as well as portions of
the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2198-9-7**] 12:33 PM
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2198-9-7**] 12:34 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of rupture of the patient's 3.8-cm abdominal
aortic aneurysm. Stability in size maintained.
2. Area of density within the left breast has a lucent center,
and may
represent an intramammary lymph node, fat necrosis, or oil cyst.
Recommend
correlation with mammogram.
3. Stable appearance of adrenal nodule over 5 years, described
above.
4. Status post cholecystectomy, with stable and expected
dilatation of the
common bile duct.
5. Diverticulosis with no evidence of diverticulitis.

cirrhosis or
other parenchymal disease. No mass lesion identified. There is
no
intrahepatic biliary dilatation. There has been interval
