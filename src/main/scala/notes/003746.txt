Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3561**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status, septic shock

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, central line placement, tunnelled line placement,
deep tissue biopsy of thigh, CVVH, hemodialysis. tracheostomy

History of Present Illness:
52 year old woman with hx of lupus nephritis, multiple
sclerosis, hypertension who is presenting with altered mental
status, fever, and shock.  The patient was in her usual state of
health until yesterday when she noticed a rash late in the
evening which she mentioned to her family.  Per family, at that
time she had no other symptom that she mentioned including
headache or vomiting.  Early on the day of admission, the
patient was found minimally responsive and moaning on her bed.
EMS was called.
.
Of note she was recently seen in her nephrology clinic on [**2117-6-30**]
at which time her blood pressure was 150/90 with HR 68. At the
time she had 3+ bilateral lower extremity edema.  Her lisinopril
was increased from 5mg to 10 mg daily and her lasix was
increased from 20 mg to 40 mg daily.
.
In the ED, her initial vital signs were 104  140  60/palp 16
86% on 100%.  She received 6L of NS. She was intubated for
airway protection. A RIJ central line was placed after a failed
attempt at the left IJ.  A CXR, CT head/torso were done.  She
received vancomycin and ceftriaxone at meningitic dosing.  She
received decadon 10mg x1. A FAST u/s showed free fluid in the
abdomen.

Pertinent Results:
[**2117-7-4**] CXR -
1. ET tube approximately 1 cm above the carina. NG tube in
appropriate position and IJ catheter within the cavoatrial
junction.
2. Left suprahilar increased rounded density and left mid lung
zone 1.7 cm nodule. Dedicated lateral view may be of use in
determining what these structures are.
.
[**2117-7-4**] CT torso -
1. Moderate pleural effusions, pericardial effusion, ascites,
subcutaneous edema, and mild interstitial pulmonary edema are
all consistent with volume overload.
2. Small anterior left pneumothorax.
3. Consolidation in the lower lobes of the lungs bilaterally,
most suggestive of aspiration, probably with a component of
atelectasis as well. Infection cannot be excluded.
4. Fibroid uterus.
.
[**2117-7-4**] CT head - Limited study without evidence of hemorrhage or
mass effect.
.
[**2117-7-6**] CT abdomen/pelvis:
1. Worsening of bibasilar effusions and associated airspace
disease, most
likely atelectasis, underlying infection cannot be excluded.
Slight decrease in pericardial effusion.
2. Persistent, diffuse simple ascites, with new
ascending/transverse colitis without dilatation or perforation.
No definable abscess or focal collection, as clinically
questioned. Findings are suspicious for infectious colitis;
however, this could also be seen with ischemic bowel as a result
of prior hypoperfusion episode and/or ongoing vasculitis, given
the history of SLE. Diffuse mild small bowel thickening is felt
to be due to third spacing.
3. Delayed enhancement and no evident excretion of contrast
through the
kidneys at this time, compatible with ATN.
4. Fibroid uterus.
.
[**2117-7-6**] CT Right lower extremity:
1. Surgical wound as described above in the mid thigh anteriorly
with packing material. No soft tissue or muscle fluid collection
or abscess.
2. Diffuse low-attenuation throughout the muscles of the thigh,
which may represent muscle edema. Muscle infarct is not entirely
excluded.
3. Fluid tracking in both the deep and superficial fascial
compartments of the anterior and posterior thigh. No soft tissue
gas is present.
4. Probable bone infarct of the proximal tibia.
.
[**2117-7-4**] echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20
%). Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with mild global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe(3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
moderate sized pericardial effusion, mostly posterior (minimal
anterior fluid seen). There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomyopathy. Moderate pericardial effusion
without overt tamponade.
.
[**2117-7-14**] echo: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The
effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or
other cellular elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
52 year old woman with history of multiple sclerosis, SLE c/b
nephritis presenting with altered mental status found to be in
shock complicated by multi-organ failure.
.
# Septic shock: [**2-27**] serratia bacteremia presumably from GI
source given pancolitis on CT abdomen/pelvis.  Shock requiring
max dose 4 pressors on presentation and she was initially
started on broad spectrum antibiotics and stress dose steroids
until blood cultures grew serratia bacteremia.  Also cardiogenic
in setting of sepsis as EF was severely depressed on initial
echo obtained upon presentation to the ED (since normalized s/p
treatment of sepsis).  Serratia was initially covered with
cefepime which was then changed to ciprofloxacin given
sensitivities as per ID recs.  She completed a full 2 week
course of the above antibiotics with resolution of her shock and
discontinuation of pressor support.  Of note, she also grew
serratia from right leg deep tissue biopsy (performed by surgery
on presentation), but suspect leg was seeded from blood as
opposed to leg as source of bacteremia.  CT right LE was
negative for fluid collection/abscess/air. At the time of
discharge, her BP was stable, she was afebrile, and there was no
leukocytosis.
.
# Livedo necrosis:  Right lower extremity biopsied on initial
presentation out of concern for necrotizing fasciitis and source
of sepsis.  General surgery and dermatology were consulted and
deep tissue biopsy did not show e/o nec fasciitis however did
also grow serratia to lesser degree than in blood.  CT right
