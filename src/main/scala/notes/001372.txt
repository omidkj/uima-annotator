HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 87-year-old woman
with history of COPD who presents with decreased mental
status, mumbling, anorexia, and dyspnea for the last 2-3
days.  In [**2101-10-8**] the patient was admitted to the
[**Hospital1 69**] MICU for COPD
exacerbation and pneumonia, intubated for respiratory failure
times 24 hours, given Levaquin and steroids and then
discharged on [**2101-11-1**].  She was recently readmitted to the
MICU on [**2102-1-29**] with an ABG of 7.18, PCO2 122, PO2 217 on
non invasive ventilation with improvement in mental status
and ABG to 7.4/63/56.  Her hypercarbia was thought to be
secondary to Opioids and Benzos.  She was not given steroids
during that admission.  Now patient presents with decreasing
mental status, mumbling, anorexia and dyspnea times 2-3 days.
No fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest pain,
palpitations, abdominal pain or cough.  The patient arrived
by ambulance from home, was somnolent but arousable to verbal
stimuli.  Her vital signs on admission, temperature 98.8,
blood pressure 126/34, pulse 91, respiratory rate 30 and O2
sats of 75% on room air, with increasing to 93% on four
liters of oxygen.  Her ABG at that time was PH 7.22, PCO2 95,
PO2 85 on four liters of oxygen.  Bi-pap ventilation was
initiated with increase in sats to 93 to 97%.  She was more
awake with the bi-pap ventilation.  Her next gas showed
improvement with PH 7.24, PCO2 87 and PO2 of 62.  Upon
initial presentation to the MICU her white blood cell count
was 20.4 and subsequently she was given one dose of Levaquin.
She was hydrated with D5 normal saline.  Upon stabilization
of her respiratory status, she was transferred to the [**Hospital1 139**]
service on [**2102-2-14**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  COPD, on home O2 2-3 liters for last
four years.  Adenocarcinoma of the rectum, status post
resection, LAR [**4-/2098**].  Lower back pain.  Osteoarthritis.
Anxiety.  Migraine headaches.  SIADH.  Osteoporosis.  Old
lacunar infarct in the right coronary radiata.

ALLERGIES:  Doxycycline.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission, Albuterol 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **], Atrovent 2
puffs tid, Ritalin 5 mg q day, Colace 100 mg po bid, Zantac
150 mg po bid, Klonopin 0.5 mg [**Hospital1 **], Darvon 65 mg po q 6 hours
prn, Megace 40 mg/ml 1 tsp qid, Serevent 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **].

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is divorced, lives with her two
sons at home.  History of tobacco use, quit 20 years ago,
prior to that 40 pack year history.  No ethanol, no IV drug
use, no exercise.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On transfer to [**Hospital1 139**] service,
temperature 97.4, pulse 82, blood pressure 138/60,
respiratory rate 18, O2 saturation 97% on 35% venti mask.
General, alert and oriented times two, no apparent distress.
Pulmonary, decreased breath sounds bilaterally, no wheezes or
crackles.  Cardiovascular, regular rate and rhythm, S1 and
S2.  Abdomen, nontender, non distended, positive bowel
sounds, soft.  Extremities, no cyanosis, erythema or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 12.6, hematocrit
33.6, platelet count 291,000, sodium 132, potassium 4.8,
chloride 31, CO2 36, BUN 27, creatinine 0.6, glucose 141,
calcium 8.4, phosphorus 2.6, magnesium 1.9.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary:  Through the rest of her course on the [**Hospital1 139**]
firm the patient's pulmonary status remained stable.  She did
not require any bi-pap at night and her O2 requirements
slowly decreased to baseline level of [**3-12**] liters.  Her O2
saturation at time of discharge was 93% on two liters of
oxygen.  The patient's respiratory decompensation was thought
to be secondary to excessive Benzodiazepines, narcotics on
top of her underlying COPD.  The patient's white blood cell
count decreased over the course of her stay in the hospital.
Since there was no radiographic evidence of pneumonia, the
patient was not continued on antibiotics.  No steroids were
initiated.

2.  Infectious Disease:  The patient's white blood cell count
decreased over the course of her stay in the hospital.  The
patient remained afebrile throughout the course of her stay
in the hospital.  The patient had femoral line placed in her
femoral vein.  Initial sets of blood cultures drawn through
the femoral line grew coagulase negative staphylococcus and
corynebacterium.  Subsequently the femoral line was removed
and the tip was sent for culture.  The tip culture also grew
coagulase negative staphylococcus and corynebacterium.  Prior
to starting Vancomycin, two surveillance cultures were drawn
peripherally.  The patient was started on Vancomycin for
empiric treatment.  The surveillance cultures remained
negative at time of discharge and subsequently the Vancomycin
was stopped.  The patient remained afebrile throughout the
course of her stay in the hospital.  The patient's white
blood cell count trended down through her course in the
hospital.

3.  GI:  The patient's hematocrit remained stable throughout
her course of stay in the hospital.  Her stool was guaiac
positive.  Given her history of rectal carcinoma, she will
need a follow-up colonoscopy as an outpatient.  She remained
hemodynamically stable throughout the course of her stay in
the hospital.

4.  Neuro:  The patient's mental status improved with
improvement in her respiratory status.  The change in mental
status that brought her to the hospital was likely secondary
to her hypercarbic respiratory distress.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary to
Benzodiazepine and narcotic use.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Atrovent MDI 2 puffs tid, Serevent
MDI 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **], Albuterol MDI 2 puffs q 4-6 hours prn,
Tylenol prn, Zantac 150 mg po bid, Colace 100 mg po bid,
Ritalin 5 mg po q day, Megace 40 mg/ml, 1 tsp qid.

nursing and VNA, home PT.  Patient to follow-up with PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
