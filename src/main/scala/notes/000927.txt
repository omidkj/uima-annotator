Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**]
Chief Complaint:
productive cough, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of PICC line


History of Present Illness:
61 y/o male with history of right lung Non Small Cell Cancer,
s/p right upper lobe lobectomy, severe COPD, and a history of
MRSA and psuedomanous PNA who presents from ED to ICU with
hypoxia and possible PNA. He recently had a 3 week
hospitalization for COPD exacerbation and treated for a
pneumonia with Bactrim (for MRSA) and levaquin (for
pseudomonas). He was discharged on [**8-6**] but continued to feel
SOB and was readmitted several days later where he grew out
pseudomonas Resistant to ciprofloxacin. Workup also included a
CXR which showed a question of interstitial process and CTA was
negative for PE but did reveal bilateral patchy infiltrates in
middle and lower lobes bilaterally c/w pneumonia. Pt was treated
with vancomycin and ceftaz during this hospital course, and was
discharged on prednisone taper.
.
He was doing well at home until 1 week PTA when he reports onset
of fevers to 101, weakness, SOB, pleuritic CP, cough. Denies any
arm or jaw pain, diaphoresis, nausea, palpitations. ROS + for
photophobia, dizziness with some balance loss, but no loss of
consciousness over this time period as well.
Pt therefore presented to [**Hospital **] hospital. He remained clinically
stable throughout his course at MVH - afebrile, BP
110s-130s/60s-70s, HR 60s-80s, RR 18-24 and sats of 93% on 3L ->
93% on 2L. His pulmonologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14069**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] and
recommended transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible bronchoscopy to
figure out why he is having recurrent COPD flares.
On arrival here, he states that his breathing feels comfortable.


Past Medical History:
1. Non-small cell lung cancer, s/p R upper lobectomy, partial R
fifth rib resection c/b chronic pain. No chemo or radiation.
2. COPD w/ severely reduced DLCO, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC ratio
3. h/o MRSA and pseudomonas PNA
4  UC - s/p multiple surgeries, most recently in late 80s. S/P
total colectomy and ileostomy
5. Steroid induced hyperglycemia
6. PFO
7. h/o cardiomegaly
8. h/o depression


Social History:
Married, 2 daughters, lives on the [**Name (NI) **].  Not current
smoker, quit in [**2177**] w/ dx of lung cancer, 40 pack-yr history.
Occasional EtOH use. Worked as a paiting contractor, retired
after lung cancer surgery.


Family History:
F died of lung cancer; M died of Alzheimer's. Has 3 sisters, all
older than him, healthy

Pertinent Labs/Studies:
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2181-9-8**] 10:10 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. New right middle lung opacification most consistent with
newly developing pneumonia given acuity of onset (1 month).
2. Underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, status post
right thoracotomy.
.
[**2181-9-24**]: Portable CXR -
IMPRESSION:
Minimal worsening of right pneumonia, superimposed upon severe
emphysema.  It is difficult to exclude a component of
necrotizing infection.
Persistent air collection at right apex, likely due to a
postoperative
pneumothorax, unchanged since recent radiograph, but worse when
compared to older studies from [**2181-7-20**].
.
[**2181-9-11**]: Echocardiogram
Conclusions:
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.
2. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral
valve is not well seen.
3. There is no obvious vegetations seen, but the cardiac valves
are not well seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 y/o M w/ h/o NSCLC s/p RUL lobectomy, severe COPD, recurrent
pna over past couple months, with righ sided PNA
(MRSA/Pseudomonas) and severe hypoxia requiring significant O2
suppplementation.
.
1. PNA with Severe Hypoxia: Had right multilobar PNA with
MRSA/Pseudomonas growing from sputum, with WBC count of 9,000
and bandemia as high as 22%, elevated anion gap, and elevated
lactate to 2.4. Also has poor underlying lung function from COPD
(FEV 1.2L in [**2181-7-20**]) and h/o right upper lobe lobectomy.
Patient was initially treated with high flow face mask of 15 L
at 40% with additional NC with saturations varying from 88 to
98%, but with continued frequent coughing which causes
desaturations. The patient has since decreased his oxygen
requirement to Venti amsk at 12 lpm with O2 sats rangin 89 to
97%. The patient continues to cough and is draining sputum well
with transition from dark brown thick sputum to thinner
grey/clear s
