Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10593**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p failed gallstones removal c/b gallbladder perforation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IR guided attempted removal of gallstones and fragmented
cholecystostomy tube (failed attempt), complicated by
perforation of the gallbladder.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 92497**] is a 61 y/o male with h/o HTN, COPD, chronic renal
disease on HD, s/p AAA repair and cholecystitis who was admitted
to the MICU after a failed attempt to remove stones/biliary
dilation and removal of previous catheter fragment that was
complicated by gallbladder/cystic duct perforation. The patient
presented with acute cholecystitis on [**2169-10-17**] and
underwent percutaneous cholecystostomy; at that time as based on
his comorbidities he was not felt to be a good surgical
candidate. Since then he has undergone ERCP x 2 with
sphincterotomy as well as failed laparoscopic cholecystectomy
because of adhesions on [**2170-2-8**]. His cholecystostomy
tube came out accidentally and a new percutaneous tube was
replaced on [**2170-3-9**]. Unfortunately this
cholecystostomy tube was severed by VNA, leaving him with a
cathetar fragment at his ostomy site.
.
Of note, all of his prior care has been at [**Hospital1 498**]. He was
referred to IR (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4686**] for a cholangiogram via his
existing cholecystostomy tube +/- stone extraction, catheter
fragment removal and sphincteroplasty. The procedure performed
yesterday was unsuccessful in removing the gallbladder stones or
the catheter fragment, and was also complicated by
gallbaldder/cystic duct perforation. Pt was hemodynamically
stable, complaining only of RUQ pain ([**5-8**]).
.
This morning pt had episodes of hypotension with SBP's to the
70's prior to dialysis. Pt was mentating well, Tmax of 100.1.
Pt not currently complaining of abdominal pain.  Pt was
transferred to the MICU because of concern for sepsis following
perforation.

Imaging:

CT Abd/Pelvis ([**2170-4-10**]):
1. Phlegmonous change within the gallbladder fossa with one
intact pigtail
catheter in place. There is also a fragment present laterally
within No
drainable collection identified. Adjacent inflammatory fat
stranding and
pericholecystic fluid.
2. Moderate duodenal diverticulum.
3. Simple cysts within both kidneys.
4. Multiple stable subcentimeter hepatic hypodensities which are
too small to characterize.
4. Intrahepatic ductal dilation with enhancement of the
intrahepatic duct
suggestive of cholangitis.
5. Stable aneurysmal aorta and right common iliac artery.
6. Sigmoid and ascending colon diverticulosis, without evidence
of acute
diverticulitis.
.
TTE ([**2170-4-11**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
RUE Ultrasound ([**2170-4-12**]): No evidence of deep venous thrombosis
in the right upper extremity.
.
CXR ([**2170-4-15**]):
Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. No lung parenchymal
disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
61yoM with h/o HTN, COPD, chronic renal disease on HD, s/p AAA
repair and cholecystitis who was admitted after failed attempts
by IR to remove stones and previous catheter fragment,
complicated by gallbladder/cystic duct perforation and sepsis.
.
# Hypotension/Perforated Gallbladder/Common Bile Duct: The
patient was admitted on [**4-9**] following a failed IR attempt to
remove gallstones and a cholecystostomy catheter fragment, which
was complicated by gallbladder/cystic duct perforation with
contrast seen extravasating from the gallbladder.  Post
procedure BPs were in the 90s from a baseline of 120-140
systolic, attributed to sedation with slow clearance in the
setting of liver failure.
