Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the floor after evaluation in the
emergency room. He began to undergo DT's prior to surgery, he
was transferred to the SICU and was intubated. He was
subsequently taken to surgery and returned intubated to the
SICU. He was extubated the following day. He continued to be
agitated and was kept and halodol and ativan. Subsequent to his
extubation the ICU team noted that the patient had increasing
trouble swallowing. An MRI was obtained. This showed anterior
hematoma, but no compression on the airway. For safety the
patient was re-intubated. He was extubated when an airleak was
noted around the ET tube. He was discharged to the floor when

evaluated by physical therapy.

Discharge Instructions:
You have undergone the following operation: Anterior Cervical
Decompression and Fusion

Immediately after the operation:
-	Activity: You should not lift anything greater than 10 lbs for
2 weeks. You will be more comfortable if you do not sit in a car
or chair for more than ~45 minutes without getting up and
walking around.

-	Rehabilitation/ Physical Therapy:
o	2-3 times a day you should go for a walk for 15-30 minutes as
part of your recovery.  You can walk as much as you can
tolerate.
o	Isometric Extension Exercise in the collar: 2x/day x 10 times
perform extension exercises as instructed.

-	Swallowing: Difficulty swallowing is not uncommon after this
type of surgery. This should resolve over time.  Please take
small bites and eat slowly.  Removing the collar while eating
can be helpful ?????? however, please limit your movement of your
neck if you remove your collar while eating.

-	Cervical Collar / Neck Brace: You need to wear the brace at
all times until your follow-up appointment which should be in 2
weeks.  You may remove the collar to take a shower.  Limit your
motion of your neck while the collar is off. Place the collar
back on your neck immediately after the shower.

-	Wound Care: Remove the dressing in 2 days.  If the incision is
draining cover it with a new sterile dressing.  If it is dry
then you can leave the incision open to the air.  Once the
incision is completely dry (usually 2-3 days after the
operation) you may take a shower. Do not soak the incision in a
bath or pool.  If the incision starts draining at anytime after
surgery, do not get the incision wet. Call the office at that
time. If you have an incision on your hip please follow the same
instructions in terms of wound care.

-	You should resume taking your normal home medications.

-	You have also been given Additional Medications to control
your pain.  Please allow 72 hours for refill of narcotic
prescriptions, so plan ahead.  You can either have them mailed
to your home or pick them up at the clinic located on [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] 2.
 We are not allowed to call in narcotic (oxycontin, oxycodone,
percocet) prescriptions to the pharmacy.   In addition, we are
only allowed to write for pain medications for 90 days from the
date of surgery.

-	Follow up:	
o	Please Call the office and make an appointment for 2 weeks
after the day of your operation if this has not been done
already.
o	At the 2-week visit we will check your incision, take baseline
x rays and answer any questions.
o	We will then see you at 6 weeks from the day of the operation.
At that time we will most likely obtain Flexion/Extension X-rays
and often able to place you in a soft collar which you will wean
out of over 1 week.

Please call the office if you have a fever>101.5 degrees
Fahrenheit, drainage from your wound, or have any questions.
