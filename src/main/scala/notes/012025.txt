History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 953**] is a 76 y.o. M s/p CABG on [**2129-6-7**] complicated
post-operatively with pulmonary edema, intubation and mechanical
ventilation, recently discharged to [**Hospital1 **] on [**7-12**], presents
for dyspnea.  He was noted to have experienced respiratory
distress at 0900, audible bilateral wheezes and increased work
of breathing with retractions. He was given albuterol nebs,
lasix 60 mg IV x 1, solumedrol 60 mg IV x 1, and placed on 10L
bipap at [**Hospital1 **].  CXR and EKG completed and he was placed on
tele.  CE and BNP were collected and ABG completed at [**Hospital1 **].  He
was unable to take his meds po and was lethargic but arousable.
CK 322, trop I <0.05, BNP 4374. ABG at 7 AM at [**Hospital1 **]
7.4/45/93/30 --> ABG at 10:42 AM at [**Hospital1 **] 7.45/46/82/31. CXR CHF
with possible superimposed PNA in RUL. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation.

Per son, the patient has had constant audible wheezing since he
was extubated on [**6-23**] after his CABG.  He states that his father
also had some wheezing prior to admission.  Patient himself
states he has chronic cough but non productive. Denies fever,
chest pain, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea.

CXR: Recomended PA and lateral chest radiograph when condition
permits for
further evaluation of increased retrocardiac opacity which may
represent
atelectasis or pneumonia. Mild pulmonary edema or cardiomegaly
are similar to [**2129-7-7**]

CT trachea:
1. No tracheal stricture.
2. Mild bronchomalacia of bronchus intermedius and left lower
lobe basal
trunk.
3. Small oropharynx and hypopharynx could be the source of noisy
breathing, more likely stridor than wheezing.
4. Small postoperative pericardial effusion, retrosternal soft
tissue
thickening and small retrosternal hematoma common postoperative
findings.
5. Diaphragmatic pericardial calcification is chronic.

ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior akinesis and
severe inferolateral akinesis. The remaining segments contract
normally (LVEF = 35-40%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened, and there is tethering of the
posterior leaflet to the akinetic LV segments. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+), posteriorly directed
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate to severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w prior inferoposterior MI. Moderate ischemic
mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2129-6-4**]
(last full echocardiogram), left ventricular systolic function
has improved slightly, primarily due to partial functional
recovery of the inferolateral segments. Pulmonary pressures are
higher. The other findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo M with CAD s/p CABG in [**6-11**] complicated post-op course
with pulmonary edema and prolonged intubation and mechanical
ventilation who now presents from rehab with dyspnea, likely due
to COPD flair.

# Dyspnea: On arrival pt was requiring 6L NC for adequate
saturation. Wheezing and poor movement was concerning for COPD
flare. PT was treated with IV then PO steroids,
albuterol/ipratropium, and antibiotics for possible pneumonia.
Although OSH CXR was read as CHF, clinically pt did not appear
fluid overloaded. Lasix was intially held for prerenal renal
failure but was restarted on his standing regimen to keep him
euvolemic. There was also concern of tracheal stenosis from long
intubation vs. tracheobronchomalacia, thus CT scan was preformed
and ruled these etiologies out. Pt improved with treatment of
COPD and pneumonia with decreasing requirements for O2 and
improving subjective SOB. Pt also had ECHO to evaluated post
CABG function, which revealed slightly improved function but
worsening pulmonary hypertension.

On discharge pt was satting mid 90's on 2L nasal canula, will
need to complete another 5 days of Levofloxacin and Vancomycin,
a long taper of Prednisone and nebs prn.

# Acute renal failure: Baseline 1.5. peaked at 2 on admission,
slowly trending down. Thought to be prerenal with FeUrea 27, low
urine Na, with possible contrast nephropathy component.
Nephrotoxins were maximally avoided, I/O closely monitored. On
discharge creatinine was 1.8.

# CAD s/p CABG: EKG remained unchanged, and pt denied chest
pain. He was continued on his medical regimen of BB, statin,
ASA. He may benefit from ACEi if renal function allows, given
his decreased EF.

# Atrial fibrillation: Well rate controlled. Anticoagulated but
coumadin held given supratherapeutic INR. Coumadin was restarted
on [**7-22**] at 3mg and will need to be adjusted based on ongoing
INRs given interaction with frequently changing antibiotic
regimen. Digoxin level was checked in the setting of renal
failure and found to be elevated. Dosing was decreased to QOD
and should be rechecked in 3wks to ensure appropriate dosing.

# OSA: Recently diagnosed periop. Not tolerating CPAP at rehab
but was able to use for several hours per night while admitted.
Should continue autoset CPAP at rehab and home.

# HTN: Well controlled on home regimen of  carvedilol

# Hyperlipidemia: Simvastatin continued

# h/o delerium: Pt was started on standing Haldol on previous
admission, and continued TID. Here was only given nightly prn
