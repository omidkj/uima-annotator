[**2106-10-14**]: CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the SICU on [**10-14**] with sudden onset
oliguria, acute CHF exacerbation, diarrhea and G+ stool.
Nephrology transplant, hepatology, gastroenterology, and
cardiology were consulted.  Cardiac enzymes were followed and
trended downward.  He was fluid restricted and diuresed.  Daily
serum creatinine levels were 4.5-4.8.  Initial hematocrit was
stable at 30.8 and trended upward with appropriate reticulocyte
count.  Daily rapamycin levels were followed.  On [**10-16**] he was
stable to be transferred to the floor.  On [**10-20**] he underwent
capsule endoscopy to evaluate for midgut GI bleed and results
were pending.  He also received IV iron on [**10-21**], but towards the
end of this infusion (500mg/500cc), he became acutely short of
breath after ambulating to the bathroom off O2. O2 dropped to
low 80s. He was hypertensive and tachypneic. A non-rebreather
was applied with improved O2 to 90-91%. IV lasix and iv
lopressor were given with slight improvement. CXR showed severe
symmetric bilateral opacification worse in the lower lungs had
progressed, particularly on the left, accompanied by stable
moderate left and  small right pleural effusion. EKG was stable.
Levaquin was started for pneumonia. He was transferred to the
SICU for management. He was briefly placed on bipap and was
subsequently weaned to a non-rebreather after more iv lasix and
IV hydralzine were given. A lasix drip was started. O2 sats
improved and the non-rebreather was switched to nasal cannula.
The lasix drip was changed to po lasix. He was transferred out
of the SICU.

Nephrology discussed potential need for hemodialysis in the
future. Vein mapping was recommended. This was done on [**10-25**].

He was discharged to home with home O2 as he desaturated to 87%
while ambulating. Vital signs were stable.

Of note, rapamune dose was adjusted for trough level of 10 on
[**10-24**]. Dose was decreased to 2.5mg qd. A script for liquid
rapamune was provided. Levaquin course was completed as of [**10-25**].
