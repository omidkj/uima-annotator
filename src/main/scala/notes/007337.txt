Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization [**2108-11-29**] x 2


History of Present Illness:
61yo F w/ hx of HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, CAD, s/p MI and CABG x
3 (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM, SVG-RCA) in [**2097**], s/p known occluded vein
grafts, s/p cardiac cath in [**2103**] c/b dissection of the LCx and
s/p 2
Cypher DES placed. Pt is s/p prosthetic [**Year (4 digits) 1291**] in [**1-/2107**] for AS and
underwent cath prior to that surgery and had a BMS to the left
subclavian artery.  Most recently [**2108-10-1**] had 80% ostial LAD
lesions and got BMS to proximal LAD.
.
Patient reports worsening chest pain over the last few months,
and reports using nitro multiple times a day.  This pain occurs
with rest and with activity.  She describes intermittent chest
pain over past 3 days which became constant, associated with
diaphoresis.  On the day of presentation, the patient had sudden
onset of substernal chest pain while walking, and experienced
associated shortness of breath, palpitations, diaphoresis.  She
denies any presyncopal symptoms, nausea, or vomiting.  Despite
[**3-31**] does of NTG, the pain was did not improve, and the patient
activated EMS.
.
When EMS arrived in the field, HR was 210, BP 160/110.  Pt was
given SL NTG and Lopressor 5mg IV X 3 which brought rate to
140s-150s.  On presentation to ED, initial vitals were BP
144/106, HR 85, RR 20, 98% on 2L.  Pt received several mg IV
morphine, nitro 0.4mg LS, ativan 0.5mg IV, then 1mg IV, dilauded
1mg X 2, ASA 325, Lopressor 5mg IV X 2.  Was started on Nitro
gtt which was increased to 200mcg/min. Despite these
medications, the patient only had mild improvement of symptoms.
Initial ECG showed afib with new LBBB pattern, ST depressions in
V5, V6.  Given unremitting chest pain and positive cardiac
markers, the patient was admitted to the CCU for further
monitoring with planned cath in the morning.

described fixed inferior wall perfusion defect. No definite new
or reversible perfusion defects identified, although the

LVEF of 36%.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. NON-ST ELEVATION MI
The patient presented with chest pain, ST depressions on ECG and
positive biomarkers consistent with an NSTEMI.  She was
initially placed on a nitro drip in the ED and given Morphine,
then Dilaudid for pain control.  Upon arrival to the CCU on
[**2108-11-29**], she underwent cardiac catheterization during which an
in-stent restenosis of her BMS to LAD was seen.  She had distal
filling via her LIMA graft and no intervention was performed.
The patient continued to have chest pain post-procedure and was
taken back to the cath lab later that day.  She had a DES placed
in the in-stent thrombosis of her prior BMS to LAD.  She was
able to be weaned off the nitro drip and chest pain subsided.
She was transferred out of the CCU on [**2108-11-30**].  She continued to
take her home doses of MS Contin and Morphine IR for pain
control.  She was chest pain free until the morning of [**2108-12-2**]
when she developed an episode of chest pain similar to her
anginal pain while walking to the bathroom.  ECG showed a
junctional rhythm with RBBB which had changed from admission.
Pain was releived with rest and SL nitro X 1.  The patient then
developed chest pain later that same day of similar nature.  Her
isosorbide mononitrate was increased first to 60mg PO qday, then
to 90mg PO qday.  Her metoprolol was decreased du
