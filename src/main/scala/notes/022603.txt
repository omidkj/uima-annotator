CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Pneumonia/sepsis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81 year old Hispanic
male with a history of coronary artery disease status post
myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure with ejection
fraction of 31%, status post CVA with residual left sided
weakness, who was recently discharged from [**Hospital6 8866**] on [**12-12**] following a month long admission
for head and neck bilateral dissection of laryngeal cancer
and total laryngectomy and trach placement.  He presents with
progressive cough and fatigue per family.  His [**Hospital6 8866**] course was also notable for being discharged
on Flagyl, levofloxacin and Keflex for a two week course and
complicated by pharyngocutaneous fistula as well as Mobitz
type I arrhythmia.  He was sent to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and one day
prior to admission he was noted to be in respiratory distress
with a respiratory rate of 30 to 32 and minimally responsive
to albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.  Vital signs at that
time were temperature 98.3, blood pressure 160/100, heart
rate 104, 97% in room air.  Upon arrival at [**Hospital1 346**] blood pressure was 60/30,
respiratory rate 28, 98% on 100% tent mask.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Status post CVA with left sided
weakness.  Coronary artery disease status post myocardial
infarction.  Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction
of 31%.  Vitamin B-12 deficiency.  Head and neck cancer
status post total neck dissection and total laryngectomy with
subsequent trach placement.  Cataracts.  Aspiration.  Mobitz
type I heart block.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin causes shortness of breath.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Topical bacitracin, glycopyrrolate
1 mg NG t.i.d., heparin subcu b.i.d., regular insulin sliding
scale, Reglan 10 mg NG q.i.d., Lopressor 25 mg NG b.i.d.,
Flagyl 500 mg NG t.i.d., nystatin 2 million units swish and
spit t.i.d., Zantac 150 mg NG b.i.d., pravastatin 20 mg NG

nebulizers, aliconazole powder, Jevity tube feeds at 85 cc an
hour, fluconazole 100 mg NG q.d. times seven days, free water
150 cc NG q.eight hours.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.0, blood pressure
117/61, heart rate 88, respiratory rate 12, 100% on trach
mask.  In general, patient was awake, responded to yes/no
questions, nonverbal, breathing comfortably.  HEENT left
surgical pupil.  Right pupil 3 mm.  Anicteric sclerae.  Neck
supple.  Well healed surgical scars with no fluctuance of
discharge.  Tracheostomy clean, dry and intact.  Oropharynx
with thrush on tongue.  Cardiovascular exam regular rate and
rhythm, normal S1, S2.  Lungs clear to auscultation on left
anterior laterally, decreased breath sounds with occasional
crackles on right.  Abdominal exam soft, distended,
percussive, decreased bowel sounds, no suprapubic tenderness.
Extremities warm, no ulcers, no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 19.5, 77% neutrophils, 18%
lymphocytes, hematocrit 36.9, platelets 441, MCV 99.  Sodium
130, potassium 5.9, chloride 97, CO2 25, BUN 23, creatinine
0.7, glucose 314.  Urinalysis was positive for nitrites, 500
glucose, 0 to 2 white blood cells, occasional bacteria, no
yeast.  Chest x-ray revealed diffuse right infiltrates
consistent with aspiration pneumonia, also possible left
lower lobe pneumonia.  EKG #1 revealed tachycardia at 122, no
P waves seen, new right bundle branch block with T wave
inversions in V1 through V5, Q waves in V2 through V5.  EKG
#2 revealed sinus tachycardia at 106, normal axis, old ST
depressions in V5 through V6, T wave inversion in V4, old Qs
in V3 and V4 with resolved right bundle branch block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted directly to the
medical intensive care unit for control of his respiratory
distress and hypotension.  His hospital course will be
documented by issues which are as follows.

1.  Respiratory distress.  Otorhinolaryngology was consulted
emergently for evaluation of his tracheostomy and further
workup of his right lung collapse.  Pulmonary was also
consulted for emergent bronchoscopy and patient was
adequately suctioned with adequate aeration thereafter.
Patient was initially started on vancomycin, ceftazidine and
clindamycin for broad coverage.  Aggressive chest physical
therapy and aggressive suctioning were performed throughout
his hospital course.  His oxygenation continued to remain
satisfactory.  His antibiotic regimen was tailored based on
his sputum gram stain revealing moderate growth of gram
negative rods and patient will complete a 10 day course of
ceftazidime.

2.  Cardiac.  The patient was noted to be hypotensive on
admission which responded well to IV fluid boluses.  Cardiac
enzymes were subsequently drawn and there was noted to be a
peak CK of 156 with MB of 7 and peak troponin of 13.5.  It
was felt that this was due to his pneumonia coupled with
demand ischemia.  No further workup was suggested at this
time.  He was continued on aspirin, ACE inhibitor and beta
blocker as per his outside meds.  His blood pressure remained
stable throughout his hospital course after initial
presentation.  Telemetry again demonstrated Mobitz type I
block with occasional PVCs.  Metoprolol was decreased to 12.5
mg b.i.d.

3.  Anemia.  The patient was noted to have an admission
hematocrit of 37 which slowly down-trended with IV fluid
hydration.  Given his history of vitamin B-12 deficiency, we
have included cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg IM subcu q.month.

4.  Glucose control.  The patient was noted to have
fluctuating hyper and hypoglycemia which eventually
stabilized on a regimen of NPH 20 units q.a.m. and q.p.m.
plus regular insulin 10 units q.a.m. and q.p.m. and tolerated
well covered with a regular insulin sliding scale.

5.  Nutrition.  The patient was continued on his tube feeds
at a goal rate of 85 cc an hour.  He is to have a barium
upper GI series which will be performed at [**Hospital6 8866**] for further evaluation of his swallowing.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.
