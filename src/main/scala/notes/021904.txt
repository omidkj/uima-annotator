MICROBIOLOGY:
[**2179-7-17**] BLOOD CULTURE Blood Culture, Routine-PENDING
INPATIENT

[**2179-7-17**] LENI:
LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and Doppler
son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of
the left common femoral, left superficial femoral and left
popliteal veins
show normal compressibility, flow and augmentation. Left
posterior tibial and peroneal veins show normal flow.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in left lower extremity veins.

[**2179-7-17**] CTA:
CT OF THE CHEST: The visualized lungs show trace bibasilar
atelectasis, but no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. The visualized heart and pericardium are
unremarkable. Mediastinal, axillary and hilar lymph nodes do not
meet CT size criteria for pathologic enlargement. No filling
defects are noted within the pulmonary vasculature to suggest
pulmonary embolism. The abdominal aorta shows normal caliber. No
intramural hematoma or dissection is noted. This study is not
optimized for subdiaphragmatic evaluation. Within this
limitation, there is a small hiatal hernia noted. The upper
abdominal
structures are otherwise unremarkable.  Multilevel degenerative
changes are noted but no focal lytic or sclerotic lesion
suspicious for malignancy are identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute pulmonary embolism or acute aortic injury.
2. Small-to-moderate hiatal hernia.
3. Bibasilar atelectasis.

[**2179-7-17**] CT Abd/Pelvis:
ABDOMEN: The visualized lung bases demonstrate minimal dependent
atelectasis. There are pacing wires within the heart. There is a
small hiatal hernia but the stomach and abdominal bowel loops
are otherwise normal in their appearance. The spleen, adrenals
and pancreas appear within normal limits given the lack of IV
contrast. The liver and gallbladder appear normal.  Contrast is
being excreted from the kidneys related to the earlier
contrast-enhanced CT the patient received but otherwise the
kidneys appear normal. The aorta and its branches appear normal
in caliber. No free air or free fluid or adenopathy is present.
PELVIS: No free air or free fluid or adenopathy is present,
although the deep low pelvis is difficult to evaluate due to
extensive streak artifact from the right hip fixation hardware.
Contrast is present within the bladder. Colonic diverticula are
present without diverticulitis.
BONE WINDOWS: There is right femoral and acetabular fixation
hardware which appears intact. One of the acetabular fixation
screws, however, traverses through the acetabulum with its tip
within the expected location of the iliacus muscle (2:63) which
is atrophied. Scoliosis is present with
degenerative changes but no suspicious bone lesions are present.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute findings in the abdomen or pelvis although low
pelvic evaluation
is limited by streak.
2. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
3. Intact right hip fixation hardware with an acetabular
fixation screw
traversing throu
