Chief Complaint:
Cough, Dyspnea, and Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
55 yo female with history of hypocomplimentemia (C3 and C4),
necrobiosis lipoidica with chronic leg ulcers on long term
immunosuppressant, multiple past admissions for pneumonia
presents with complaints of productive cough and dyspnea for
approximately 2 weeks, worse over the last 3-4 days.  Patient
also reports feeling very tired and weak, with fever to [**Age over 90 **]
yesterday. Had one episode of hemoptysis last night, with a
small amount of blood on a towel. Denies abdominal pain,
vomiting, dysuria, or diarrhea. No [**Age over 90 **] contacts or recent
travel.
.
Of note, she has multiple episodes of PNA (4 in the last 5
years); was hospitalized in [**2124**] for pseudomonal sepsis and
pneumonia. Most recently admitted for PNA in [**2127-4-22**]. Pt also
has history of recurrent UTIs; most recent culture showed
pan-sensitive E.coli in [**2126-10-22**]. Pt had multiple UTIs in [**2125**]
included Enterococcus (resistant to tetracycline), Enterobacter,
and pseudomonas resistant to cipro and meropenem. Her leg wound
has been chronic and has required skin grafts; it was also
infected back in [**2124**] when pt was septic.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 98.4, 95, 106/52, 20, 84% RA.  She
triggered for hypoxia. Labs significant for WBC 15, CXR
concerning for multifocal PNA. Patient was given vancomycin and
zosyn. Also given 1 amp D50 for glucose 55, and 2L NS for SBP in
the 90's.  She was given hydrocortisone due to chronic
prednisone use.  Admitted to the MICU for continued lethargy.

On the floor, pt is very sleepy but arousable.  Maintaining good
sats on 2L NC.

CXR- [**2127-12-2**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is mild
progression.  The pre-existing extensive bilateral multifocal
areas of opacities, presumably reflecting multifocal pneumonia
show a rapid tendency to consolidations. As a consequence, the
lung bases have decreased in transparency and the number of
visible air bronchograms has increased. No evidence of newly
appeared focal parenchymal opacities. Unchanged size of the
cardiac silhouette. Presence of a minimal left pleural effusion
cannot be excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pneumonia:  Patient reported two week history of fevers, cough,
brief hemoptysis, and shortness of breath.  Presented with
leukocytosis on admission and worsening bilateral infiltrates on
chest x-ray.  Given history of multiple pneumonias in the past,
she was started empirically on vancomycin, zosyn and
levofloxacin.  Sputum culture was obtained along with blood and
urine culture.  In the ED she was hypoxic to 84% on room air and
admitted to the ICU for observation.  She was started on
hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q6hrs with SBP's in the 90's given
concern for adrenal insufficeincy due to history of chronic
prednisone use.  In the ICU, oxygen requirements were weaned to
room air, and leukocytosis improved.  Patient was afebrile for
the remaining hospital stay.  Based on history of recurrent
pneumonias, she was dischaged on levofloxacin to complete a
total of 10 day course of antibiotc therapy.  Post discharge,
patient's sputum samples came back positive for two different
strains of Pseudomonas Aeuriginosa. Both starins were sensitive
to levofloxacin with a MAC of 0.25.  Should follow up patient's
symptomatology in clinc, and consider Xray to assure no
advancement of radiographic consolidation.

Hemoptysis: has a history of hemoptysis.  Had trace hemoptysis
prior to presentation, thought to be secondary to her
bronchiectasis.  Hematocrit stayed stable
