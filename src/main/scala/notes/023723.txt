ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Chest pain.
2.  Unstable angina.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft times three.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old
man with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
inferior MI in [**2137**], treated with TPA.  The patient has
recently had two episodes of left arm pain radiating to the
chest in the past two weeks.  The patient did have associated
diaphoresis, shortness of breath, and nausea.

The patient went to an outside hospital where an EKG revealed
an ST depression in V4 and T wave changes in the lateral
leads.  The patient received Plavix, Lovenox, aspirin,
nitroglycerin, Lopressor, and Captopril.  He was transferred
to the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital for cardiac
catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Myocardial infarction in [**2137**], treated with TPA.
3.  Diabetes mellitus times five to six years.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Glyburide 10 mg b.i.d.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
3.  Glucophage 1,000 mg b.i.d.
4.  Imdur 50 mg q.d.
5.  Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.
6.  Avandia 8 mg q.d.
7.  Lipitor 20 mg q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  General:  The patient is
an elderly appearing gentleman in no acute distress.  Vital
signs:  Stable, afebrile.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.
EOMI, PERRL, anicteric.  The throat was clear.  Neck:
Supple, midline, without masses or lymphadenopathy.  No JVD
or bruit.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm without
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended,
without masses or organomegaly.  Extremities:  Warm and
noncyanotic times four.  There is 1+ pitting edema
bilaterally.  Palpable dorsal pedis pulses bilaterally.
Neurological:  Grossly intact.

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  CBC 5.5/30.7/170.  PT 13.8, INR
1.3, PTT 34.2.  Chemistries:  140/3.9/103/27/19/1.1/184.  ALT
38, AST 78, alkaline phosphatase 90, amylase 63, total
bilirubin 0.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for urgent cardiac
catheterization.  This revealed an ejection fraction of 45%
and a right dominant coronary artery system.  There was
severe three vessel disease with occlusive left circumflex
disease.  The patient was referred to the Cardiothoracic
Surgery Service for probable emergent revascularization
procedure.  The patient was assessed and appropriately
preopped.

On [**2151-3-3**], the patient was taken to the Operating Room for
coronary artery bypass grafting times three with LIMA to the
LAD, saphenous vein graft to the OM and PDA.

Postoperatively, the patient was taken to the CRSU for closer
monitoring.  On postoperative day number one, the patient did
have an episode of atrial fibrillation and flutter.  The
patient received Amiodarone and was placed on an Amiodarone
drip.  The patient was extubated later on postoperative day
number one.  Atrial fibrillation continued despite p.o.
Amiodarone and the patient was begun on anticoagulation with
heparin and Coumadin.  All appropriate pressors were weaned
off and the patient was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day number four.

While the patient was on the floor, he was initially fairly
lethargic and a Swan study was obtained in order to make sure
that the patient would not aspirate.  The patient passed the
swallowing study.  It was also noted that the patient had
some marked drainage from his sternal incision requiring
three dressings on the first night that it was noticed, the
night of postoperative day number four.  Anticoagulation was
stopped and the patient was assessed for sternal drainage.

The drainage steadily decreased and there was no evidence of
a wound dehiscence.  Hematocrit remained largely stable in
the upper 20s.  The patient continued to work with Physical
Therapy and showed slow and steady improvement.  The patient
did convert back into normal sinus rhythm.

On postoperative day number eight, the patient complained of
some tenderness around his right lower extremity saphenous
vein graft harvest site.  There was some minimal erythema
which was marked but seen to increase in size over the course
of the day.  The patient was begun empirically on Kefzol,
although he remained afebrile and never had an elevated white
count.  The erythema did not expand through the rest of his
hospital course.

On postoperative day number ten, the patient was restarted on
antihyperglycemics and monitored overnight to see his
response.

Ultimately, the patient was discharged on postoperative day
number 11, after having been cleared for discharge home by
Physical Therapy.  At that time, he was tolerating a regular
diet, in good pain control on p.o. pain medications, and
having no further anginal symptoms.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.  Normal sinus rhythm.
Unchanged erythema of the right lower extremity.

DISPOSITION:  To home.

DIET:  Cardiac and diabetic.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Plavix 75 mg q.d.
2.  Percocet 5/325 one to two q. four hours p.r.n.
3.  Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
4.  Lasix 60 mg b.i.d. times ten days.
5.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq b.i.d. times ten days.
6.  Lopressor 12.5 mg b.i.d.
7.  Rosiglitazone 8 mg q.d.
8.  Metformin 1,000 mg b.i.d.
9.  Glyburide 10 mg b.i.d.
10. Amiodarone 400 mg b.i.d.
11. Keflex 500 mg q.i.d. times ten days.
12. Combivent inhaler two puffs q. four hours p.r.n.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient should follow-up with
his cardiologist in one to two weeks time and address the
need for anticoagulation as well as diuresis and adjustment
of cardiac medications at that time.  The patient should
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in four weeks time.  The patient
was instructed to elevate his legs when sitting or laying
down.  He should also continue monitoring the erythema on his
right lower leg and report if he has significant fevers,
chills, or spread of the erythema.
