Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is an 82 yo female w/ bronchiectasis, CHF and COPD who
presents with an acute change in mental status (became
nonverbal). On EMS arrival to her home, she was found to be
cyanotic and in respiratory distress. Was placed on NRB with
sats to 90s. Family states she had a sore throat yesterday, but
no cough or SOB that they noted. Also mention in records of ear
pain and odynophagia last night, as well as chills.

In the ED, initial VS: T 98.7 75/39 79 20 80s RA -> high 90s
NRB. Placed on BiPAP, satting 100%. Patient told EMS she did not
want to be intubated. ED paged her pulmonologist [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
re: intubation, and he said patient would not want to be
intubated; family also agrees. Her PCO2 on BiPAP was 110 with pH
7.05 so settings were increased from [**9-22**] to 15/8 with better Vt
(repeat ABG/lactate pending). Family unsure re: central lines,
DNR status. CXR with increased RUL infiltrate and ?dilated
bowel, also ?UTI, so given levofloxacin, metronidazole,
vancomycin, cefepime to include Pseudomonas given
bronchiectasis. She received 1.5 L of NS. Head, abdominal CT
performed to look for other sources of infection. Noncon CT head
and abd unremarkable. Current VS: 80/paced 98/60 28 96%BiPAP. On
2nd L IVF, on norepi 0.08 peripherally. Mental status improving.
She was given 1 L NS on the floor.

Note that remaining parts of hx (PMHx, Meds, SHx, FHX) are per
records given acuity of patient's presentation and treatment.

CXR [**2139-12-5**]: Stable appearance of the lungs since [**2139-4-4**].

CT head [**2139-12-5**]: No acute intracranial pathological process, or
overt change from prior study. MRI scanning is more sensitive
than CT imaging in detecting acute brain ischemia.

CT abd/pelvis [**2139-12-5**]:
1. Limited exam without oral or IV contrast, but no evidence of
intraabdominal catastrophe.
2. Moderate bibasilar bronchiectasis.
3. Significant vascular calcifications.
4. Left renal hypodense lesion, likely a simple renal cyst.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented with an acute change in mental status with
hypercapnic respiratory distress. Appeared to be in setting of
septic shock with potential sources being PNA and UTI. She was
initially admitted on BPAP with pressure settings of 15/8.
Initially, ABG showed improved ventilation and acidemia,
although repeat ABG in the ICU showed worsening CO2 retention
and acidemia despite high levels of pressure support (20/8). She
was continued on broad antibiotics with
vanco/cefepime/levofloxacin/ metronidazole and received 125mg IV
methylprednisolone. She had arrived on peripheral
norepinephrine, but was transitioned to IVF boluses when the PIV
infusing norepinephrine was lost. Family meeting was held with
her 3 sons and they wished to observe for improvement in the
next few hours before deciding on how aggressive to treat her,
but agreed to DNR/DNI, no CVC and no Aline at that time. Her BP
continued to trend down to SBP in 70s with minimal UOP, and IVF
were stopped given O2 sat 90% on 100% FiO2. Her RR was in
40s-60s initially, and she received a dose of 1mg IV morphine
for symptom control. After about 4 hrs from admission, her RR
trended down to 10-12 suggesting she was unable to maintain
appropriate ventilation. Her family then agreed that comfort was
the priority and prn morphine was ordered; the patient expired
shortly after and autopsy was declined.
