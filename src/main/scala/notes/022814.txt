[**2124-1-28**] Cardiac Catheterization:
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION: CAD, cardiogenic shock
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA to LAD, patent SVG to ramus.
3. Successful stenting of OM1.
4. Successful PTCA of the LMCA.
5. Successful PTA of the right external iliac artery.
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant circulation
demonstrated
severe native three vessel disease. The LIMA had a distal 70% in
stent
restenosis vs thrombosis. LAD had diffuse 70-80% proximal and
mid
disease. The LCX into the major OM branch had a 99% proximal
instent
restenosis vs thrombosis with TIMI 2 distal flow. The AV groove
vessel
had an ostial 90% lesion. RCA was proximally occluded.
2. Angiography of bypass grafts showed patent LIMA to LAD. The
SVG to
ramus was widely patent. SVG to OM was known occluded.
3. Resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated filling
pressures. The mRAP was 19 mmHg and mPCWP was 38 mmHg. The
cardiac
output and cardiac index were reduced at 3.9 L/min and 2.2
L/min/m2 with
presumed oxygen consumption index of 125 ml/min. There was
moderate
reactive pulmonary hypertension. Significant V wave in the wedge
tracing
was indicative of severe ischemic mitral regurgitation.
4. Successful stenting of OM1 with three overlapping 2.5 mm
MiniVision
stents and PTCA of the LMCA in-stent restenosis with a 3.5 mm
balloon.
5. Successful PTA of the right external iliac artery with a 7.0
mm
balloon and placement of a 7Fx30 cc IABP.
.
[**2124-1-28**] Echocardiogram:
 There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
inferior akinesis, inferolateral hypokinesis, inferoseptal
akinesis and anteroseptal hypokinesis. Anterior and
anterolateral systolic function appears preserved in focused
views. Views are suboptimal for estimation of ejection fraction
(?30%?). Intrinsic function may be more significantly depressed
given the presence of significant mitral regurgitation. The apex
is not visualized. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened (aortic valve gradient not assessed); aortic
regurgitation and stenosis were not adequately assessed. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. At least mild to
moderate ([**1-24**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen in focused views
(parasternal long axis view only; may be underestimated). There
is no pericardial effusion detected in focused views.
.
[**2124-1-31**] Chest X-Ray:
FINDINGS: ET tube, NG tube, and Swan-Ganz catheter are in good
position.
There is no pneumothorax. There is increasing pulmonary edema
and bilateral small effusions. There is persistent cardiomegaly.
The patient is status post median sternotomy with normal
alignment of the sternal sutures.
IMPRESSION:
1) Increasing primary edema.
2) Small bilateral effusions and persistent cardiomegaly.
3) Lines and tubes in good position. No pneumothorax.
.
Cardiac Catheterization [**2124-2-2**]:
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Hemodynamic instability.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful stenting of the LMCA.
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of the left coronary artery showed a 60%
distal
LMCA stenosis, diffuse disease with up to 30% stenoses in the
previously
treated OM1 and a 90% ostial stenosis of the jailed LCX (which
only
supplied small OM2/3).
2. Resting hemodynamics showed mildly elevated right and left
heart
pressures with a preserved cardiac output.
3. Successful stenting of the LMCA with a 3.5 mm Taxus
drug-eluting
stent, which was post-dilated to 4.0 mm.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old male with CAD s/p CABG '[**16**] (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM,
SVG-ramus) PCI with stent from LMCA to LCx presents with ISR
after stopping ASA, coumadin x1 week for elective TURP (Plavix
off for 3 mos).  Found to be in cardiogenic shock, intubated,
cathed with new stent opening up LMCA-LCx into OM1 on [**1-28**] and
distal Left Main stent on [**2-2**].  Patient was extubated
successfully on [**2124-2-3**].
.
1. ACS:
 Ischemia - s/p cath with In stent rethrombosis of LMCA/LCx
stent. The LMCA was then stented (bare metal) to the OM1.
Continued ASA, plavix, statin.  Patient enrolled in SHOCK trial.
 Pt failed extubation on first attempt and reintubated.  The
thought was that possibly ischemia from remaining vessel disease
vs MR could be contributing to his lack of tolerating
extubation.  Patient returned to cath on [**2-2**] and had stent to
distal Left Main lesion.  Cardiac enzymes continued to trend
down and peak CK was 252 and peak MB 10 on [**2124-1-29**].
 Pump - Patient was requiring Dopamine and
