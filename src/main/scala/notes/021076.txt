Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA
ejection velocity. All four pulmonary veins identified and enter
the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD
by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Moderately dilated LV
cavity. Moderately depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Mild global RV free
wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Focal calcifications in
aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter. Focal
calcifications in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter.
Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta
diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). Thickened AVR
leaflets. Increased AVR gradient. Abnormal AVR. No masses or
vegetations on aortic valve. Severe AS (AoVA <0.8cm2). Mild (1+)
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification. Calcified tips of
papillary muscles. No MS. Mild to moderate ([**12-29**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate [2+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR. Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. No TEE related complications. The patient received
antibiotic prophylaxis. The TEE probe was passed with assistance
from the anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. The patient
was under general anesthesia throughout the procedure. The
patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally
post-bypass data

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is globally moderately depressed.
3. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.

POST-BYPASS: Pt is being A paced and is on an infusion of
epinephrine and phenylephrine
