Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Outside hospital transfer for intracerebral hemorrhage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation
PICC placement
nasogastric tube placement
Lumbar Puncture x 2

History of Present Illness:
76yo man with PMH significant for HTN, hyperlipidema, DM, old
lacunar stroke by head CT, presents with one day abnormal
behavior and lethargy and acute worsening in mental status,
transferred from an OSH with ICH. Reportedly, he was found by
his family in bed when he would usually be taking care of his
wife.
They brought him to [**Hospital3 3583**], where he was found to be
febrile and thought to have a LLL PNA. He had a head CT on
admission that showed only an old lacunar infarct. He was found
to have GPC bacteremia, and started on vancomycin and
levofloxacin. During the day on [**9-17**], however, he stoppedf
following commands, and was only responding "yup" to questions.
He went for head CT, where he was found to have a right frontal
ICH with SAH of unknown size (reports did not accompany patient
on transfer, and referring MD is not available). He was
intubated for airway protection and transferred. Prior to
intubation he was noted to have nystagmus, equal pupils,
movement of his right
side, and "twitching" of his left side. He was sent to [**Hospital1 18**].

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2122-9-18**] 1:53 AM
FINDINGS:
There is a 2.1-cm right frontal intraparenchymal hematoma with
subarachnoid hemorrhage in the adjacent cerebral sulci in the
frontal lobe. There is mild perilesional edema noted around the
parenchymal hematoma. There is no mass effect, shift of normally
midline structures, or hydrocephalus. There is no
intraventricular hemorrhage. Dural calcifications are noted in
the frontal region, parasagittal in location.

A small hyperdense focus noted in the left frontal region, most
likely represents volume averaging from adjacent frontal bone
(series 4, image 12). No osseous lytic or sclerotic lesions are
noted.

IMPRESSION: Right frontal intraparenchymal hematoma with
subarachnoid hemorrhage in the adjacent frontal sulci on the
right side with no mass effect or midline shift.
Please note that on the preliminary report, subdural extension
was wrongly mentioned; it is subarachnoid extension.

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2122-9-18**] 10:23 AM
FINDINGS: CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: A 2.1-cm right
frontal intraparenchymal hematoma is again redemonstrated with
subarachnoid hemorrhage. Edema is again noted surrounding the
hematoma. Otherwise there is again change with no mass effect,
no shift of the normally midline structures and no evidence of
hydrocephalus. There is no intraventricular hemorrhage. Dural
calcifications are again noted in the frontal region. The
ventricles and the extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid spaces are
slightly prominent likely due to age-appropriate parenchymal
involution. The patient has an ET tube and an OG tube in place.

CTA OF THE HEAD: There are punctate atherosclerotic
calcifications in bilateral distal vertebral arteries. The left
vertebral artery is dominant and the right vertebral artery has
narrower caliber due to hypolasia; in addition there appears to
be effective PICA termination with marrow segment after the
origin of PICA. There is no flow- limiting stenosis of the
vertebral arteries. There are degenerative changes noted in the
cervical spine that is visualized, more severe in the C1- C2
articulation but also seen in the C2-C3 region.

There are also atherosclerotic calcifications noted in bilateral
carotid arteries particularly at the bifurcation of the common
carotid artery and in the carotid siphons. There is moderate
stenosis of the right proximal internal carotid artery but
without any flow-limiting stenosis. There is no evidence of
aneurysm formation or other vascular abnormalities. However, we
cannot exclude underlying vascular lesion in the region of the
right frontal hematoma itself.

Based on the axial images obtained there is no obvious evidence
of venous thrombosis. However, this is pending confirmation by
review of the 3D venous reconstructions.
There are degenerative changes noted in the visualized portions
of the cervical spine.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of aneurysm or other vascular abnormality.
However,we cannot exclude underlying vascular lesion in the
region of hemorrhage. Would recommend CT angiogram to evaluate
for underlying vascular lesion in the region of hemorrhage after
resolution of the hematoma.

2. Based on the axial images no evidence of venous thrombosis.
However, this result is pending review of the venous
reconstructions.

3. Atherosclerotic disease involving predominantly bilateral
internal carotid and left common carotid bifurcation. No
flow-limiting stenosis or occlusion.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 6452**] W & W/O CONTRAST  [**2122-9-19**] 2:42 PM
CERVICAL SPINE:
FINDINGS: At C3-4 level, there is mild-to-moderate spinal
stenosis seen with mild indentation on the spinal cord. At other
levels in the cervical region at C2-3, C4-5 to C7-T1, mild
degenerative changes are identified. No abnormal signal seen
within the spinal cord. Prevertebral soft tissue thickness is
maintained. No evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis. Mild
increased signal is seen in the posterior soft tissues which
indicate mild soft tissue edema.
IMPRESSION: Mild-to-moderate spinal stenosis at C3-4 level with
slight extrinsic indentation on the spinal cord. Mild
degenerative changes at other levels. No evidence of discitis or
osteomyelitis.

THORACIC SPINE:
FINDINGS: Anterior osteophytes are identified at T1-2 level and
also in the lower thoracic region. There is no abnormal signal
seen within the vertebral bodies or discs or abnormal
enhancement identified. There is no discitis or osteomyelitis
seen. Mild increased signal between the osteophytes at T1-2
level could be secondary to degenerative change.

There is no spinal cord compression seen or intrinsic spinal
cord signal abnormalities.

IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis in
the thoracic region.

LUMBAR SPINE:
FINDINGS: From L1-2 to L3-4, mild degenerative changes noted.
At L4-5, thickening of the
