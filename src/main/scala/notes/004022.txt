Service:  MED


PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Postmenopausal bleeding status post dilation and
    curettage.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Diabetes.
5.  Postoperative CRFA endometritis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 53-year-old woman with
a history of diabetes, chronic hypertension, and congestive
heart failure, who presented originally with postmenopausal
bleeding x1 episode. An ultrasound done as an outpatient
showed an endometrial stripe of 12 mm and normal ovaries. The
decision was made to do a D and C to rule out malignancy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery
disease, CHF with a ejection fraction of 55% on a [**2192-3-28**]
echo, insulin dependent diabetes, atypical chest pain with a
negative work up and a negative MIBI on [**2192-3-28**], asthma,
sleep apnea, anemia, lower extremity edema, GERD, and a PE in
[**2188-9-28**] requiring 12 months of Coumadin
anticoagulation, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, migraines,
colon polyps, depression, hypercholesterolemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  D and C x3, open cholecystectomy in
[**2161**], right knee arthroscopy bilateral rotator cuff repair
and acromioplasties.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Singulair 10 q day.
2.  Prilosec 20 q day.
3.  Renodil 800 t.i.d. with meals.
4.  Humulin.
5.  Seroquel 25 at bedtime.
6.  Verapamil 240 q day.
7.  Albuterol.
8.  Bupropion.
9.  Lisinopril 20 q day.
10. Effexor.
11. Lasix 40 q day.
12. Advair.

ALLERGIES:  Codeine, aspirin, Augmentin, Trazodone,
ibuprofen, Atrovent, Reglan, Ampicillin, and Lipitor.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives alone and ambulates independently.
She denies any type of alcohol or drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for heart disease, diabetes, and
colon cancer.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted on [**11-20**] for an
outpatient procedure of a dilation and curettage for
postmenopausal bleeding. However, during the procedure the
patient was noted to have dis-complete ventilating by
anesthesia. A quick curettage was done. The hysteroscopy
portion was aborted and the patient was too unstable to
extubate, although intraoperative chest x-ray was consistent
with pulmonary edema that was thought to be due to her CHF.

She was brought to the ICU for diuresis and ventilation
weaning. She was given Lasix overnight on postoperative day
#0, and diuresed well. A chest x-ray done 4 hours after the
initial chest x-ray done intraoperatively showed improvement
of the pulmonary edema after IV Lasix. She continued to
diurese well overnight and was extubated on postoperative day
#1. She remained well oxygenated on room air into
postoperative day #2.

Cardiac: Given the flash pulmonary edema, cardiac enzymes
were cycled x3 and were all negative for any evidence of a
troponin leak. An EKG was noted to have a right bundle branch
block, but had been noted at a preoperative EKG.

Hypertension: The patient was started on a nitro drip for the
CHF, which was successfully weaned off by postoperative day
#1. She was started on her home regimen of hypertensive
medications. Her blood pressure ranged in the less than 120's
to 202/60's to 80's. The 202/64 was noted to be an out layer
and on postoperative day #2 it was felt that she was well
controlled on her home regimen.

Diabetes: She was started on a regular insulin sliding scale
with adequate control of her sugars in the 200's. She was
started on her diabetic diet on postoperative day #1, and
started on her home insulin regimen with sugars in the mid
200's.

Asthma: She was started on her home regimen of Albuterol
inhaler, had noticed some productive cough, and this was sent
off for cultures. However, as noted, the chest x-ray that was
done after diuresis did not show any evidence of infiltrates
suggestive of pneumonia.

Postoperative fever: She spiked to 101.3 on postoperative day
#0, and given the chest x-ray with no evidence of infiltrates
beyond pulmonary edema, as well as a negative UA, it was felt
this was most likely consistent with endometritis. She was
started on Gentamycin and Clindamycin until she was 24 hours
afebrile. This was discontinued on postoperative day #2.

After a thorough discussion with the ICU team, it was felt
that she was stable for discharge home. She continued to have
no postoperative issues with regards to her medical
management. The ICU team felt that her current home regimen
was actually adequate for the [**Hospital 228**] medical issues. She
will follow up closely with her primary care physicians, as
well as her respective specialists. She was discharged home
in stable condition on postoperative day #2 from the ICU.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Continue home regimen. She will also
use extra strength Tylenol at home for pain control, as
ibuprofen causes gastritis.
