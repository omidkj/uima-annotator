GERD

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2111-1-22**] Rigid Bronchoscopy, placement of a 14mm Y-stent

Bovona trach
[**2111-2-6**] Nissen fundoplication


History of Present Illness:
62yo F w/ admission to St. Vincents for complaints of a several
days of increased SOB/sputum change.  Ultimately, the patient
required vent support and work-up at the OSH discovered severe
TBM.  The pulmonary service at the OSH sent the patient to [**Hospital1 18**]
for definitive management.  She completed a course of bactrim
for a Stenotrophomans and Serratia PNA (?CAP vs VAP).  Upon
transfer, she was on the vent but tolerating oral feeds., HD
normal with no new culture or temparture findings.

Past Medical History:

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the CSRU where initial work-up
included an airway CT scan and a bedside flexible bronchosopy.
She was deemed a non-surgical candidate given her functional
status and likely prior tracehal resection.  On HD3, the patient
had a 14mm Y-stent and within 12 hours, she was able to
extubate.  Speech and swallow as well as ORL saw the patient.
They agreed that the patient does have paradoxic movement of her
cords -- continuance of her usual diet of soft solids & thin
liquids.

Early on the morning of HD 5 the patient had an episode of acute
respiratory distress for which she was bronched. Thick
secretions were suctioned and the patient improved.  Later that
day a second bronchoscopy was performed with revealed an almost
completely plugged L mainstem bronchus and distal portion of the
Left limb of the stent.  This plug was removed with a much
suctioning and ultimately the patient coughed it out. Upon
replacing the scope the stent was visualized to be in good
position and now clear of secretions.  She was started on
mucomyst nebs and Ciprofloxacin for 7 days.

Over the ensuing 72 hours, she was given aggressive pulmonary
care and appeared quie stable clincally.  Her secretions were
more easily managed and discussions were held between the
Interventional Pulmonology service and the Thoracic Surgical
Service as to whether or not the Y-stent was a tenable solution
for long-term palliation of her severe tracheobronchomalacia.
Although not entirely documented, she appears to have had prior
tracheal surgery/reconstruction and it is unclear if her
recurrent laryngeal nerves were injured at this time,
nonetheles, she does in fact have paradoxic cord motion and
severe tracheobronchomalacia in the setting of prior tracheal
reconstruction with the background of a prolonged
hospitalization for respiratory failure and pneumonia.  She is
not an ideal surgical candidate, particularly since she has a
high risk of recurrence/failure in the setting of where a major
reconstruction would be the only realistic chance for potential
palliation (i.e. thoracotomy, tracheal resection, bronchoplasty
+/- mesh prosthesis).

However, the patient continued to be suctioned for large amounts
of thick yellow secretions.  She also developed severe cough and
chest tightness after the stent placement.  She had a bedside
bronchoscopy on [**2111-1-26**] with suction of large amounts of
secretions.  The patient was started on prednisone because of
the possibility of an asthmatic component contributing to her
cough and mucous production.  The patient was re-bronched [**2111-1-28**]
to evaluate the Y stent as well as the secretions because it did
not appear as if she was tolerating the stent.  It was
determined that the Y-stent was in the appropriate position with
only minimal secretions noted and distal granulation tissue
forming at the left bronchial limb of the Y-stent.  However even
though the patient is not an ideal surgical candidate, her
tracheal malacia was so severe that it required treatment and
surgery remained the only and best option for her.  Because a
tracheobronchoplasty can result in proximal esophageal motility
disorder, which can worsen acid reflux leading to aspiration and
further vocal cord dysfunction, it is imperative that she
undergo definitive surgical treatment for her reflux before the
tracheoplasty is performed.  As part of her GERD workup, the
patient had an esophageal manometry study on [**2111-1-29**] which showed
diffuse esophageal spasm and a slightly hypotensive lower
esophageal sphincter.  The patient had repeat bronchoscopies on
[**2111-1-30**] and [**2111-2-2**] for therapeutic aspirations.  On [**2111-2-4**], the
patient went to the OR for a rigid bronchoscopy with granulation
tissue excission, stent removal, and tracheostomy tube change
which she tolerated well and improved the patient's symptoms.
Two days later, the patient went to the OR again for a
laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication.

The patient's post-operative course was uneventful as she was
soon able to tolerate a regular diet.  She was started on
Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.  After a recovery period of a week,
the patient returned to the OR on [**2111-2-15**] for tracheoplasty. Pt
recovered well from tracheoplasty and post bronch revealed good
repair. She was maintained on empiric  keflex for tracheal mesh.
Coumadin was resumed and lovenox was d/c'd once INR was
therapeutic. Her main issue post op was pain control-requiring
prolonged use of parenteral narcotics. she is currently on po
pain med and using parenteral narcotics for break thru.

she requires ongoing hospital level of care at [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Hospital3 6783**]
Hospital and then transition to home.
