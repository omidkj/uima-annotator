History of Present Illness:
This 79 year old male with known aortic stenosis has been
followed for at least the last 10 years by his primary in New
[**Location (un) **] with serial echocardiograms. A little over a year ago
he had two syncopal episodes. The first occurred while in the
shower, the second while climbing up a flight of stairs.  On
both occasions he became dizzy and weak prior to passing out.
Over the past six months he has had progressive dyspnea on
exertion, which has exacerbated more over the past three months.
He is now short of breath with performing daily activities and
is classified as NYHA class III. Due to his significant decline
he was referred for right and left heart catheterization. He is
also being referred to cardiac surgery for an evaluation of an
aortic valve replacement.

Pertinent Results:
[**2155-2-17**] Echo: PREBYPASS: No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a very small pericardial
effusion.
POSTBYPASS: Biventricular systolic function remains normal.
There is a well seated, well functioning bioprosthetic in the
aortic position. No AI is visualized. The remaining study is
unchanged from prebypass.
