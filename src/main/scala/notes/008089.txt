Admission Date:  [**2172-11-4**]       Discharge Date:  [**2172-12-17**]

Date of Birth:   [**2117-3-1**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient presented with a
history of type 2 diabetes, on insulin at baseline, admitted
on [**2172-11-4**] for a Whipple procedure to stage a
pancreatic mass.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.  2.
Jaundice.  3.  No known coronary artery disease.  4.  No
pancreatic insufficiency prior to present episode.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Morphine sulfate 20 mg and
fentanyl.

LABORATORY DATA:  Prior to surgery, a CT scan showed no
metastasis.  Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
was done prior to surgery, with bile duct brushing negative
for malignant cells; it showed common bile duct obstruction
from a distal stricture and stents were placed at an outside
hospital and the patient's painless jaundice resolved after
placement of stents.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2172-11-4**], the patient was taken
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] to the Operating Room to undergo a Whipple
procedure.  However, intraoperatively, the portal vein was
lacerated and a Dacron graft was placed.  During the
operation, the estimated blood loss was 15 liters, requiring
33 liters of lactated Ringer's, 21 units of packed red blood
cells, 4 units of fresh frozen plasma and 2 bags of
platelets.

The patient had a very stormy recovery course.
Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit and required full ventilatory support on the
ventilator.  Due to his large transfusion, the patient was
suffering from coagulopathy.  Also, intraoperatively, due to
the graft placement, a T-tube was placed at the bile duct and
served as a drainage conduit.  A pigtail catheter was placed
outside the bile duct to drain out any biloma that was
accumulating in the abdomen.  A nasogastric tube was placed.
A feeding jejunostomy tube was placed in the Operating Room.

The patient was taken back to the Operating Room on [**2172-11-7**] for re-exploration and evacuation of the hematoma.
The patient was taken back to the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit postoperatively.  Due to the patient's dependence on the
ventilator, he underwent a tracheostomy in the Intensive Care
Unit on postoperative day number ten.

The patient was spiking fevers.  Multiple CT scans were
obtained and Citrobacter was grown out from the Dacron graft
site.  The patient was started on ciprofloxacin for 42 days,
per the recommendation of infectious disease.  This was
started on [**2172-11-13**] to treat the Citrobacter at the
graft infection.

The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition to
boost his nutritional status.  A central line was placed.
Total parenteral nutrition was continued until postoperative
day number nine.  On postoperative day number ten, the
patient was started on tube feeds, initially at 10 cc/hour
which the patient tolerated well.  Tube feeds were continued
and increased up to goal.

During this time, the patient had developed some agitation
and the patient was placed on a standing dose of Haldol to
control his agitation.  While in the Intensive Care Unit, we
essentially administered supportive care.

Eventually, on [**2172-12-10**], the patient condition was
noted to be steadily improving and he was stable enough to be
transferred on a regular floor.  Prior to transfer, the
patient had an echocardiogram which showed 4+ regurgitation.
Cardiology was consulted prior to the Intensive Care Unit
transfer and recommended cardiac medication for the
congestive heart failure while in the Intensive Care Unit.

The patient was transferred to the regular floor on [**2172-12-11**].  While on the floor, the patient was afebrile with
stable vital signs.  We obtained a swallow study on the
patient and it appeared that the patient had begun to
tolerate regular oral intake and the swallow study team had
recommended to start the patient on a soft liquid diet.  It
was recommended that patient start on soft solids and regular
liquids for a diet as tolerated.  Meanwhile, we would
continue the tube feeds.

The patient's tracheostomy was decannulated on [**2172-12-14**] and the patient tolerated the decannulation well.  Prior
to discharge, he was breathing without the tracheostomy,
saturating at 97% without any difficulties.

Cardiology had scheduled the patient for an magnetic
resonance angiogram to look at his coronary arteries.
However, due to the patient's large body habitus and
claustrophobia, the study could not be done.  Cardiology
recommended medication for the patient's 4+ regurgitation
found on the echocardiogram.

DISPOSITION:  The patient is scheduled to be transferred to a
rehabilitation facility on [**2172-12-17**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg p.o./per J-tube b.i.d., to end on
[**2172-12-23**].
Ativan 1 mg p.o./per J-tube q.h.s.
Aspirin 80 mg p.o./per J-tube q.d.
Captopril 150 mg p.o./per J-tube t.i.d.
NPH 38 units s.c.b.i.d.
Criticare per J-tube 90 cc/hour.
Magnesium oxide 800 mg p.o./per J-tube b.i.d.
Coumadin 1 mg p.o./per J-tube q.d.
Zantac 150 mg p.o./per J-tube b.i.d.
Aldactone 2.5 mg p.o/per J-tube q.d.
Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o./per J-tube q.d.
Regular insulin sliding scale.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Prior to transfer, the patient was
instructed to have his INR level followed at the
rehabilitation facility and to adjust the Coumadin level to
achieve an INR goal of 2.  The patient's diet status was a
soft solids and regular liquid diet as tolerated.  Meanwhile
he is to have Criticare per jejunostomy tube at 90 cc/hour,
also refeed with T-tube drainage and pigtail drainage.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient was instructed to follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 468**] in two weeks.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is afebrile with
stable vital signs.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, incision healed, no
drainage, no pus, T-tube in place, pigtail in place,
jejunostomy tube in place.  The patient is tolerating orals
without aspiration
