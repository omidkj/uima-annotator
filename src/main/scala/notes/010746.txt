CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Congestive heart failure, non ST elevation
myocardial infarction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75 year old female
with a history of coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft, hypertension and
hyperlipidemia, who developed a cough five days prior to
admission.  She was started on antibiotics one day prior to
admission secondary to being short of breath.  The patient
was at an outside hospital on [**1-16**], was intubated,
became hypotensive and started on Dopamine, briefly found to
be pulseless in the field.  At that time, echocardiogram
showed an ejection fraction of 20 percent with anterior
hypokinesis.  CK checked at that time was 3000, MB was 60,
troponin was 2.6.  An emergent catheterization showed patent
grafts, however, severe congestive heart failure with
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 34.

On admission to [**Hospital1 69**] the
patient was found to be in cardiogenic shock with a low
cardiac output and high SVR.  Cardiac output improved on
dopamine although the patient developed ATN and shock liver
with AST in the 10,000 range.  Urine output improved on
vasopressin.  On [**2107-1-18**], the patient was
transitioned to Milrinone and Levophed but was tachy to the
140s and hypotensive.  The patient then developed atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate versus atrial
tachycardia without any response to adenosine.  The patient
was cardioverted on amiodarone but the amiodarone drip was
discontinued secondary to liver failure.  The numbers on
[**1-18**] were more consistent with sepsis with a cardiac
output of 5.0 and an SVR of 704.  The patient was switched
back to Levophed and Dopamine and then titrated off Dopamine.

On [**1-19**], the patient developed atrial fibrillation with
a heart rate in the 170s with shocks times two and loaded on
digoxin.  Throughout this course, the patient has been on
broad antibiotics for a questionable sepsis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Significant for coronary artery disease status post
   coronary artery bypass graft in [**2102**].
2. Questionable diet controlled diabetes mellitus.
3. Hypertension.
4. Hypercholesterolemia.
5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
6. Status post mitral valve replacement, bioprosthetic valve.

5. Protonix 40 twice a day.
6. Lopressor 25 three times a day.
7. Lisinopril 5 q day.
8. Pravachol 80 q day.
9. Pulmicort.
10.Serevent.
11.Albuterol three puffs four times a day.


LABORATORY DATA:  Cardiac catheterization at the outside
hospital on [**1-13**] showed right atrial pressure of 16,
left ventricular end diastolic of 21; pulmonary artery
pressures 51/33; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 34.  Left
main coronary artery with mild disease.  Left anterior
descending with diffuse disease.  Left circumflex with mild
disease; right coronary artery with proximal total occlusion;
saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and left
anterior descending were patent.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  No significant lesions in graft
   on catheterization.  CK was elevated 3000 and MB of 60;
   the MB index was around 5 percent.  The patient was
   started on aspirin and started on a statin when her liver
   function tests improved.

1. PUMP:  Repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction
   of 20 percent with global left ventricular hypokinesis.
   Initial concern was for cardiogenic shock; however, the
   patient continued to spike fevers and physiology was more
   concerning for sepsis.  Managed with broad spectrum
   antibiotics for a two week course.  The patient remained
   tachycardic during most of the hospital course.  Once the
   pressors were weaned, able to initiate an ACE inhibitor
   and low dose beta blocker and titrate as tolerated by
   blood pressure.

1. RHYTHM:  Atrial fibrillation versus supraventricular
   tachycardia versus atrial arrhythmia.  Heart rate elevated
   to the 170s on [**1-18**].  Initially controlled with
   carotid massage; given 12 mg of Adenosine without
   significant effect.  On [**1-19**], systolic blood pressure was
   in the 70s, heart rate was in the 170s.  The patient was
   shocked times two, given bicarbonate, calcium gluconate,
   titrated up on Levophed and started on digoxin.  The
   patient needed anti-arrhythmic loading but limited by
   hepatic toxicity and blood pressures, so therefore the
   patient was started on digoxin.  When liver function tests
   improved, the patient was subsequently placed on
   amiodarone and was subsequently in sinus rhythm.

1. HYPOTENSION:  Initially presumed to be cardiogenic, but
   hemodynamics later were more consistent with sepsis and
   blood pressure and cardiac output improved with fluid
   boluses.  The patient was weaned off Levophed but
   exquisitely sensitive to small changes in dose
   questionably thought to be secondary to autonomic
   dysfunction.  Random cortisol was 6 and improved to 22 on
   corticotropin stim test.  The patient was treated with
   hydrocortisone times seven days, given low random cortisol
   but not thought to be adrenally insufficient.  Hypotension
   improved with volume.  The patient was able to be weaned
   from pressors.  Blood pressure stabilized and the patient
   was able to be started on low dose ACE inhibitor and beta
   blocker.

1. INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Persistent fevers, septic physiology.
   A chest x-ray was without infiltrate.  Urinalysis remained
   negative.  Blood cultures were negative to date.  Concern
   for sepsis given increased cardiac output and dropping
   SVR.  The patient was continued on Vancomycin,
   Levofloxacin and Flagyl for broad coverage empirically
   times two weeks on the antibiotics which were renally
   dosed.  Surveillance blood and fungal cultures were
   negative.  After a two week course of broad spectrum
   antibiotics, the patient started to produce sputum
   positive for E. Coli.  The patient was treated with a two
   week course of Ceftaz  (Cultured E. Coli was found to be
   fluoroquinolone resistant) with the improvement in white
   blood cell count and downward trend in fever curve.  The
   pathogen was thought to be from a new ventilator acquired
   pneumonia versus prior infectious etiology for sepsis.

1. GASTROINTESTINAL:  Evidence of shock liver with
   transaminases in the 10,000 range and concerning for bowel
   ischemia given guaiac positive stools.  Right upper
   quadrant ultrasound was performed without any gross
   abnormalities.  As perfusion formed, liver function tests
   normalized and bowel function returned.  Given the concern
   for guaiac positive stools, the patient had an EGD and
   colonoscopy.  EGD showed a 1 to 2 centimeter mass in the
   esophagus and mild gastritis in the stomach body.
   Colonoscopy showed non-bleeding rectal ulcer thought to be
   the cause of the guaiac positive stools.  Hematocrit at
   the time of discharge was stable.

1. NUTRITION:  Once bowel function returned, the patient was
   started on tube feeds to assist her catabolic state.  Once
   extubated, Speech and  Swallow evaluation ultimately
   cleared the patient for taking a regular diet.  At the
   time of discharge the patient was tolerating p.o. intake.

1. PULMONARY:  Evidence of congestive heart failure by chest
   x-ray and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
   Oxygenation has not been an issue during this hospital
   course.  The patient was intubated prior to arrival and
   extubated on [**2-2**], oxygenating and ventilating well.
   She received a two week course of antibiotics with
   ceftazidine for E. coli pneumonia.

1. RENAL:  Acute renal failure / ATN from shock.  Post ATN
   diuresis.  The patient's creatinine improved.  At the time
   of discharge, the renal function was stable.

1. THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  First noted on [**1-20**].  HIT antibody
   was negative, however, H2 blocker was stopped.  There was
   no evidence of DIC.  The patient was restarted on
   subcutaneous hep
