Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 983**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP to evaluate for question of
blockage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with sphincterotomy and removal of small stone

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 67 yo F with a past medical history of aortic
stenosis, DMII as well as symptomatic cholelithiasis who was
admitted to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital for elective cholecystectomy. She
underwent laproscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram on
[**2179-3-31**]. Intraop cholangiogram was concerning for blockage as no
contrast was seen to reach the duodenum, and the cystic duct was
large with sludge. Post-operatively, she was hypotensive with
systolic blood pressure in the 80s and received 1 L IVF and then
continued to receive LR at 100 cc/ hr for maintainence fluid.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP to evaluate for question
of blockage.

[**2179-4-1**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Cardiac enlargement and pulmonary congestion clearly
more marked than it was seven years ago. Findings are compatible
with CHF, if this is related to fluid overload is a clinical
question to be answered.

[**2179-4-2**] Echo:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and global systolic function (LVEF 70-75%). The estimated
cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened (cannot determine #).
There is moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
0.9 cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is an anterior space which
most likely represents a prominent fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to severe aortic stenosis. Mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function.

ERCP:
Impression:	
Normal major papilla
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep after a
guidewire was placed
A small stone was noted at the distal CBD. Otherwise, normal
biliary tree
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using
a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
The stone was extracted successfully using a balloon

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 67 yo female with PMH of aortic stenosis, DMII as
well as symptomatic cholelithiasis who was admitted to [**Hospital 1562**]
Hospital for elective cholecystectomy now transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for ERCP after intraop cholangiogram showed question of
obstruction
.
#S/p Cholecystectomy and CBD obstruction: The patient underwent
elective cholecystectomy for ~1 year of symptomatic
cholelithiasis at [**Hospital 56652**] Hospital and intraopperative
cholangiogram showed question of CBD obstruction so she was
referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP. This was initially deferred due to
her respiratory distress and hypoxia.  After the patient was
diuresed she was taken for ERCP on HD#2.  She had sphincterotomy
with balloon extraction of a small stone.  The procedure was
otherwise uncomplicated.  She was given dilaudid for pain
control.  She was kept NPO overnight and started on clears,
which she tolerated well the next morning and her diet should be
advanced as tolerated.  She was started on unasyn/cipro because
of fevers, although the fever was thought to be related to
recent ccy as she had no abd pain or acute signs of infection.
Abx were changed to cipro after ERCP and continued for a 5 day
course.
.
#Acute diastolic CHF/Aortic stenosis:  On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the
patient was dyspneic, hypoxic to 88% on 3L NC but otherwise
hemodyamically stable. She remained hypoxic to 90% on 6L NC. A
CXR was performed and showed mild pulmonary edema and pleural
effusions. She received 20 mg iv furosemide in the PACU and was
transferred to the ICU where she was diuresed with improvement
in her symptoms.  Her hypoxia was felt to be from pulmonary
edema in the setting of aortic stenosis with previous IV fluid
resuscitation at OSH to treat her hypotension.  She did have an
echocardiogram that showed EF 70%, aortic valve area of 0.8 cm2
with peak gradient 58mmHg.  After diuresis she was discharged on
RA.  She will continue her betablocker/acei on discharge and was
given lasix 20mg po to use prn for sob or le swelling.
.
# Superficial Thrombophlebitis/cellultis: Pt developed this
initially on her left forearm on at OSH. She subsequently
developed it on another area in her L forearm during ICU stay.
She has some mild erythema of the L forearm with tenderness to
palpation.  This should be monitored for signs of developing
infection.  On day of discharge her eyrthema and pain was
slightly worse.  She was discharged with 5 day course of keflex

#DM II:  The patient's home dose of metformin was held and she
was maintained on an insulin sliding scale. She should restart
her regular diabetes regimen upon discharge home.

#Hypertension: The patient was normotensive.  Her home atenolol
and lisinopril were held given her recent hypotension.  She will
eventually need to be restarted on these medications.

Hypothyroidism: The patient was continued o
