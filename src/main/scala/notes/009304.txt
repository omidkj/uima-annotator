Chief Complaint:
Reason for admission: Seizures


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 916**] is a 63yo male with PMH significant for seizures,
atrial fibrillation, and s/p CABG who is being transferred from
OSH for management of seizures. Per patient's wife, on Tuesday
the patient complained of seeing spots in his eyes. On Wednesday
night/early morning the patient complained of seeing spots
again. At approximately 4am Mr. [**Known lastname 916**] attempted to go the
bathroom but fell on the floor at which time his wife woke up
and found her husband seizing. She called 911 and the patient
was brought to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital. Initial vitals in ED were T
100.4 BP 182/66 AR 128 RR 14 O2 sat 96% RA. In the ED he had
another generalized tonic clonic seizure. He was given Keppra
via the NGT. He was intubated for airway protection. Per OSH
records, the intubation was difficult and required help of
anesthesiologist. CT scan of head and C spine were unrevealing.

.
He was then transferred to the ICU for closer management. In the
ICU the patient spiked a temperature to 102 and he was given
Rocephin and Clindamycin for suspected aspiration pneumonia. On
[**8-2**] at 3am patient went into 15-30 minutes of status
epilepticus. He was loaded with Dilantin 500mg IV x1. and placed
on benzos. Ventilation settings at this time were: SIMV TV 600
RR 10 FiO2 60% PS 15 PEEP 5. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management.
.
Per patient's wife, he was diagnosed with seizures 1 year ago
when he had a seizure at home and presented to [**Hospital1 2025**]. Found to
have CVA which was thought to be cause of seizure. He was
started on Keppra. He has not had a seizure since then but has
complained of seeing spots occasionally. She is followed closely
by her neurologist and saw him 1 month ago.
.
No recent fevers, chills, chest pain, SOB, dizziness, or
dysuria. Per wife, the patient has good and bad days but had
been feeling well prior to this admission.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
63 year old man with SOB, hypoxia
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o DVT
Shortness of breath and hypoxia. Question DVT.

Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] were performed of the IJ,
subclavian and axillary veins on the left and of the IJ on the
right. There was diminished compressibility in the left cephalic
vein compatible with acute thrombosis. There was normal
compressibility, flow, and augmentation in the other vessels.

IMPRESSION: Superficial venous thrombus noted in the cephalic
vein. No DVT.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
63 year old man with SOB, hypoxia
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o DVTs
INDICATION: Rule out DVT.

[**Doctor Last Name **] scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral common femoral,
superficial femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and peroneal
veins was performed. There is normal compressibility, color
flow, and augmentation.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of right or left leg DVT.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
HD#1 ([**2131-8-2**]):  Patient arrived in the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU-6 the
afternoon of [**2131-8-2**] intubated, sedated and in stable condition
with NGT in place.  On arrival active patient medications
included Keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] and sedation with Fentanyl 50 mcg/hr
and Midazolam 4 mg/hr.  All other home medications were intially
held.  Given suspicion for meningitis in the setting of seizure
+ fevers patient was given one dose of Ceftriaxone 2 gm IV with
infectious disease consent required for further treatment.
Also, a history suspicious for Patient was sent for urgent MRA
of head & neck and MR of head which showed:  1)No enhancing
lesions.  Chronic infarct in left parieto-occipital lesion, and
2)50% narrowing of right proximal ICA.  Left ICA origin
atheroma."  Patient was initially seen on unit by Neurology who
recommended continuation of Keppra, EEG to evaluate for seizure
activity, ECHO for new murmur + fever, LP when INR < 1.5, and an
increase in versed drip with consideration of dilantin load if
patient seized again.  Suctioning from ETT showed brownish-grey
aspirate and UA that day showed no organisms.  Patient remained
febrile throughout first day in MICU.
.
HD#2 ([**2131-8-3**]):  Patient received Tylenol for fever overnight
and had ECHO and EEG in the morning.  ECHO showed no signs of
valvular vegetations and EEG showed no signs of an epileptiform
focus.  In the setting of seizure + fevers meningitis remained
at the top of our differential diagnosis and an LP was arranged.
 Prior to admission patient had taken coumadin for his atrial
fibrillation and on transfer to MICU initial INR was 2.5,
patient was initially given 3 units of FFP with following
INR=1.7.  Transfusion of two more units of FFP resulted in no
change in INR so plan for LP was aborted.  During the day
patient became very anxious, became tachycardic to the 140s,
began demonstrati
