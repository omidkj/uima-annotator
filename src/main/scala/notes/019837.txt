Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma service for pulmonary care and
pain management related to her rib fractures. The Pain Service
was consulted for assistance with pain medication
recommendations; an epidural catheter was placed and remained in
place for several days. Her pain was only fairly well controlled
with the epidural; long and short acting narcotics were added.
it should be noted that she initially became sleepy with the
short acting narcotic and it is being recommended that the
lowest dose be used as indicated. She is also on a bowel
regimen.

Social work was consulted given her history of alcohol and
concerns voiced by her family regarding this and also for coping
related to recent death of her husband. She was provided with
information pertaining to alcohol use and treatment but refused
as noted in social work documentation. She was placed on CIWA
protocol initially but did not show any signs of active
withdrawal.

She was evaluated by Physical therapy and is being recommended
for rehab after her acute hospital stay.
