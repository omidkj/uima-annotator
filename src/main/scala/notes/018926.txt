Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
83 F ho stage 3 CKD (Cr 1.5 baseline), HTN, CAD, who is being
transfered from Cardiovascular surgery to CCU for medical
management of severe aortic stenosis and acute renal failure.
Pt presented to [**Hospital3 **] with shortness of breath. She
was told by her primary physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **] few days prior to
presentation to stop her lasix.
While at OSH, she was felt to have volume overload and was given
lasix 20mg IV initialy then switched to 40mg PO BID. Echo at OSH
showed mild concentric LVH, EF 50%, severe AS with mean gradient
31mmHg, [**Location (un) 109**] 0.75 sqcm. She then had cardiac cath on [**8-2**] (given
contrast load, unknown amount) which confirmed severe AS with
valve area 0.75 (unknown if they also evaluated coronaries).
Pt was then transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] yesterday for planned AVR. She
was noted to have Cr 2.2->3.3, bicarb 19, Na 126, K 5.5, and
pedal edema up to thighs. She was given 80 IV lasix overnight
(takes 40 po BID at home) and only put out only 20cc. Pt being
transfered to medical CCU for acute on chronic renal failure,
acute diastolic heart failure and AS.
Pt also noted to have positive UA and started on cipro.
When pt is medically optimized, plan is to take her to the OR
for AVR.

Notable OSH labs:
BNP increased to 5,000->13,000. Troponin 0.08->0.14->0.12. HCT
40, MCV 90, Ferritin 151, Fe 43, TIBC 229. Pt was given procrit
on [**2119-8-1**], per nephrology. Cr 1.5-> 2.2 prior to transfer.

On arrival to the CCU, pt is comfortable, no SOB, no chest pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 F with history of CKD (stage 3, baseline Cr 1.5), severe
aortic stenosis, HTN, HLD, DM2, admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for planned
AVR, now being transfered to CCU for management of severe AS,
acute diastolic heart failure and acute renal failure.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
#Acute on chronic Renal Failure: Pt has known CKD 3 with Cr
baseline 1.9 and Cr 3.3 on admission to the CCU concerning for
ARF. The differential included pre-renal in the setting of
volume overload and poor forward flow and intrinsic etiologies
including contrast nephropathy (recent contrast load sp cardiac
cath), cholesterol emboli (pt with severe AS and recent
manipulation of vasculature during cardiac cath), AIN (less
likely since no new medications), ATN (possible given pre-renal
state which can proceed to ATN). This was thought to be
multi-factorial with pre-renal, contrast nephropathy, and
possibly cholesterol emboli. ACE inhibitors and colchicine were
stopped. The patient was found to have elevated eosinophil
counts in her urine and in the context of no new drugs likely
causing AIN, cholesterol embolization was considered.
Fundoscopy, however, revealed no Hollenhorst plaques. The renal
service was consulted and felt that her kidney injury was likely
severe contrast nephropathy resulting in oliguric acute tubular
necrosis in the setting of severe AS. She remained oliguric and
was started on a furosemide drip to maintain her urine output.
By [**2119-8-7**], her Cr had increased to 5.0. We started metolazone
to help with diuresis and she eventually started putting out
urine. Eventually we stopped the lasix drip and the metolazone
because she was putting out good urine on her own. She had
elevated eosinophilia (20%) which can be seen in cholesterol
emboli. Her Cr plateaued at around 5 while here which his not
uncommon to see during [**Last Name (un) **], especially ATN. Again the most
likely etiology for [**Last Name (un) **] was multifactorial: cholesterol emboli,
contrast nephropathy and ATN from CHF.

# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient
presented with pedal edema and pulmonary edema, suggestive of
acute diastolic heart failure. CXR on [**2119-8-4**] showed small
bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary vascular congestion,
both of which had improved (after diuresis) on a repeat film
dated [**2119-8-7**]. Her lung sounds improved while she was here.

# Severe Aortic Stenosis: Cath at OSH showed [**Location (un) 109**] 0.78 consistent
with severe AS. Pt initialy admitted to OSH for CHF in setting
of holding her home lasix, suggestive of symptomatic aortic
stenosis. An echocardiogram was obtained that showed severe
aortic stenosis and an ejection fraction of 55%. Cardiac surgery
deferred any intervention given her acute-on-chronic kidney
injury, as described above. She was medically managed in the
cardiac care unit with afterload reduction, as described above.
Surgery decided they did not want to operate till her k
