Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2191-11-2**] Redo Sternotomy. Single Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass
Grafting utilizing free left internal mammary artery to left
anterior descending artery. Aortic Valve Replacement utilizing a
19mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Mechanical Valve.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 73 year old female with rheumatic heart disease and
history of coronary artery disease. She underwent closed mitral
commisurotomy in [**2149**]. She subsequently underwent single vessel
coronary artery bypass grafting and mechanical mitral valve
replacement in [**2158**]. Since that time, she has undergone PCI of
the right coronary artery with placement of DES in [**2188**] for
recurrent angina. Recently in [**2191-9-11**], she presented to
outside hospital with chest pain and ruled in for a small
NSTEMI. Echocardiogram at that time was notable for aortic
stenosis. While on Integrillin and Heparin, she developed melena
followed by a 17 unit GI bleed. Once her bleeding issues
resolved, she underwent cardiac catheterization. Left
Ventriculograhpy showed an LVEF of 50% without mitral
regurgitation through the mechanical MVR. Coronary angiography
showed total occlusion of LAD, 60% lesion in the distal
circumflex and patent stents in the RCA. The vein graft to the
LAD was known to be occluded. Right and left heart
catheterization demonstrated critical aortic stenosis with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Location (un) 109**] of 0.5cm2 and mean gradient of 37mmHg. The mean PA pressure
was 30mmHg and cardiac output was 3.2l/min very consistent with
congestive heart failure. Based on the above results, she was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac surgical intervention.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate left lower lobe opacity

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
73 year old woman s/p redo sternotomy/AVR/Cabgx1
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate left lower lobe opacity
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient after sternotomy,
aortic valve replacement and CABG.

Portable AP chest radiograph compared to [**2191-11-9**].

The pulmonary edema has been improved being now mild. The
bilateral pleural effusions and left lower lobe retrocardiac
atelectasis are unchanged.
The replaced aortic valve is in unchanged position.

IMPRESSION: Improvement in pulmonary edema, now being of mild
degree. Otherwise unchanged.

Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response.
Slight T wave
inversions in leads I, aVL and V4-V6 suggest possible
anterolateral ischemia.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2191-11-6**] the anterolateral T
wave
inversions are new. Clinical correlation is suggested.

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body
of the left atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium
or left atrial
appendage. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left
atrial
appendage.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular
cavity size is normal. No left ventricular aneurysm is seen.
Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed.
There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
moderate aortic valve
stenosis (area 0.8-1.19cm2) Mild to moderate ([**12-13**]+) aortic
regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic
regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.]
Asingle tilting disk mitral valve prosthesis is present. The
motion of the
mitral valve prosthetic leaflets appears normal. The transmitral
gradient is
normal for this prosthesis. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS (on milrinone):
Mild LV global dysfunction. Overall LVEF 45%.
Aortic contour is maintained.
Mitral valve prosthesis appears similar to prebypass.
A bileaflet aortic prosthesis visualized,well seated and no
periprosthetic
leaks seen. The images are poor due to acoustic shadowing .
Normal RV systolic function.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the cardiac surgical service. She
remained on Heparin with no clinical signs of active GI bleed.
She was started on Ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection.
Given her recent history of massive GI bleed and known AV
malformations, the GI service was consulted to evaluate for any
potential sources of bleeding prior to heparinization with
cardiopulmonary bypass. Capsule study was performed along with
EUS, EGD and colonoscopy. EGD found two polypoid le
