History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 60 M w/ end-stage COPD on home O2, CHF and 3
prior suicide attempts who presents to [**Hospital1 18**] ED s/p witnessed
mechanical fall down one entire flight of stairs after tripping
over his O2 tubing. Per wife and 14 year old son, he was found
with empty bottles of anti-hypertensives and anti-epileptic
medications including proprolol, gabapentin and mirtazipine that
were prescribed to a friend. [**Name (NI) **] had been slurring his words
and walking hunched over all day yesterday after having been out
at night for 3 hours without telling his wife where he was
going. Upon his return, he fell down the stairs after tripping
over his O2 tubing. Per wife who subsequently called 911, he did
not lose consciousness and was able to ask for a tissue prior to
arrival of EMS. He presented to the ED A&Ox1-2 MAE and following
commands. On initial trauma exam, there was no spinal tenderness
and good rectal tone without gross blood. During his ED course,
the pt rapidly deteriorated from a respiratory standpoint and
required intubation to maintain SaO2 > 80s. Pt was a difficult
intubation and aspirated thick olivey liquid in the field, for
which he was treated with CTX/Flagyl. (He had a heavy dinner
consisting of mashed potatoes, meatloaf, a scone and ice cream).
.
CT head/C-spine/torso shwoed injuries c/w C4 pedicle fx, T12/L1
compression fxs and T12 spinous process fractures. He also has R
clavicular fx and R pareital subgaleal hematoma as well as
multiple skin and soft tissue injuries Neurosurgery was
consulted for evaluation of spinal injuries and recommended
C-spine immobilization w/ logroll precautions in place, order
for TLSO brace and MRI C& L-spine w/n 48h to assess ligamentous
injury.
.
VS prior to xfer: Afebrile, 118 114/85 24 92% on
450/24/100/14peep
.
In [**Name (NI) 10115**] pt is intubated and sedated, not following commands as
on propofol but [**Name8 (MD) **] RN was awake and answering questions
appropriately before propofol bolus was given. Per patient's
wife who is in the process of getting divorced from him, he has
had multiple suicide attempts in the past and this was one of
them. His 1st 2 prior attempts were narcotics overdoses and his
3rd was antifreeze ingestion. He apparantly has been having
suicidal ideation since [**2124-10-3**] but exhibited markedly
worsened depressive behaviour over the past few weeks when he
lost his job and filed for bankruptcy. Per wife, they recently
had a meting with their attorney to declare bankruptcy and sell
their house. His wife then told him she wanted to get separated
and they recently looked at rooms for him to move into. She
believes this may have precipitated his recent suicide attempt.

................................................................
MICROBIOLOGY: c diff positive
................................................................
IMAGING:
[**2126-3-22**] CXR: The lungs are low in volume and show bilateral
interstitial opacities. The cardiac silhouette is enlarged. The
mediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are normal. No pleural
effusions are present.
.
[**2126-3-22**] CT Head w/o con: Right subgaleal vertex hematoma. No
intracranial hemorrhage.
.
[**2126-3-22**] CT C-Spine w/o con:
1. Left left superior articular facet fracture at C4.
2. A small amount of air noted along the PLL at C5 is likely
related to degenerative disc disease. There are disc osteophyte
complexes at C4/5 and C6/7.
3. Retrolisthesis of C4 on C5.
.
[**2126-3-22**] CT Chest/Abd/Pelvis w/o con:
1. Compression fractures of the T12 and L1 vertebral bodies and
fracture of the T12 spinous process as described above.
2. Fracture of the right distal clavicle (features are
consistent with a chronic finding).
3. Ground-glass opacities in the right upper and middle lobes
and atelectasis and consolidation in right lower lobe could
represent sequelae of aspiration or pneumonia. However, given
the history of trauma, pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be excluded.
.
[**2126-3-23**] TTE:
The left ventricle is not well seen. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
IMPRESSION: Very suboptimal image quality due to patient's body
habitus. Left ventricular systolic function is probably normal,
a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
right ventricle is not well seen. No significant valvular
abnormality seen.
.
[**2126-3-23**] MRI Spine:
1. Mild to moderate compressions of the superior endplate of T12
and L1 without retropulsion or spinal stenosis.
2. Multilevel degenerative changes. Moderate spinal stenosis
seen at L4-5 level and mild-to-moderate spinal stenosis seen at
L3-4 level. Bilateral spondylolysis of L5 with grade 1
spondylolisthesis of L5 over S1 and foraminal narrowing.
.
[**2126-3-28**] RUE U/S:
1. Superficial thrombophlebitis involving the right cephalic
vein.
2. No evidence of deep venous thrombosis within the right
subclavian, axillary, or brachial veins.

Brief Hospital Course:
60M w/ COPD, CHF, s/p mechanical fall down a flight of stairs w/
multiple spinous fx, subgaleal hematoma, and difficult
intubation for respiratory failure c/b aspiration event.
.
# RESPIRATORY FAILURE/ASPIRATION: Patient haS primarily
hypercarbic respiratory failure w/ primary respiratory acidosis
as pH 7.22 PCO2 83 PO2 136 but this is also oxygenation failure
as ABG was on 100% FiO2 so indicates high A-a gradient. Patient
has end-stage COPD and likely has PCO2 i
