Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization with Stent placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 7518**] is a 67 year old woman with known CAD who
presented to [**Hospital3 10377**] Hospital on [**2134-9-14**] with
worsening shortness of breath x 2 days. At time of presentation,
her HR was 120, RR 30's, and BP 210/136. She had a CXR and
elevated BNP of 660, felt to be consistent with congestive heart
failure. She received Lasix 60 mg IV and was started on a
nitroglycerin drip as well as NIPPV.
Patient ruled in for an NSTEMI at OSH with troponin increase
from 0.12 to 3.4. Cardiac cath was receommended at this time,
but the patient refused. Patient agreed to a Myoview stress
test, which demonstrated an apical myocardial defect with an EF
of 28%. No c/o chest pain or dyspnea. Hospital course was
complicated by UTI for which she has been treated with
Levofloxacin since [**9-15**].
.
In cath lab, all vein grafts from her CABG were down. Patient's
left subclavian was occluded. LIMA was attempted to be reached
via right brachial then right radial approach. 2 stents were
deployed to right subclavian, proximal and distal. Catheter
perforated branch of left radial artery. Heparin was stopped.
While arm was being compressed, patient became bradycardic to
30's, BP unknown. CPR was initiated x 20 seconds. Atropine was
given and heart rate to 150's. Hand Surgery was consulted for
perforation of radial artery.
.
Pt was transfered to the floor on [**9-21**]. She underwent an
additional cardiac cath on [**9-22**] with placement of 5 stents.

Past Medical History:
1) CAD s/p 4-V CABG at [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2125**], with LIMA to the LAD, SVG
sequential to [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], SVG to PDA.
2) Hypertension
3) Hyperlipidemia
4) PVD
5) s/p right carotid endarterectomy [**10-10**]
6) s/p right carotid stent in [**6-/2134**]
7) TIAs due to r/t left carotid occlusion (Patient has known
occlusion of left internal carotid artery intracranially at the
level of the opthalmic artery, and she has had multiple TIAs
from this occlusion. Patient develops TIAs when her BP becomes
too low, and thus she requires SBPs ~130s to maintain perfusion.
Patient is on Florinef due to low BP causing TIA symptoms r/t
carotid
occlusion and CHF was felt to be related to the Florinef.)
8) [**3-12**] intracranial hemorrhage [**3-12**] while on asa, plavix and
coumadin (coumadin subsequently stopped)
9) Diabetes
10) Peripheral neuropathy


Social History:
Patient lives with her husband. She has a 40 pack-year smoking
history, and she quit in [**2125**]. Patient drinks alcohol
occasionally.

Family History:
Patient has five surviving children. Two of her sons have
diabetes. Brother died of CAD in his 50s. One of her sisters has
DM2. Father died in his mid-70s from alcoholic cirrhosis. Mother
was diabetic and died in her mid-50s.

[**9-20**] Cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed severe diffuse coronary artery disease. The LMCA had
diffuse
calcification. The LAD was diffusely diseased, and was occluded
mid
segment. The LCx had severe diffuse disease with a 90% stenosis
of the
OM. The RCA was a dominant vessle with severe diffuse disease
througout.
2. Coronary angiography of the bypass grafts revealed an
occluded SVG to
D1 and an occluded SVG to RPDA. The LIMA to LAD graft was
patent.
3. The left subclavian artery was occluded proximal to the LIMA.

4. Resting hemodynamics were performed. The right sided filling
pressures were normal (Mean RA pressure was 5 mm Hg and RVEDP
was 7 mm
Hg). The pulmonary atery pressures were within the normal range,

measuring 30/9 mm Hg. The left sided pressures were normal, with
a mean
PCW pressure of 12 mm Hg. The systemic arterial pressures were
elevated
with a systolic pressure of 150-170mm Hg. The cardiac index was
calculated using FIck's principle with an assumed oxygen
consumption
index of 125 ml O2/min/m2, and was mildly decreased at 2.2
L/min/m2.
5. Left ventriculography revealed a depressed ejection fraction
of 36%.
There was no gradient across the aorta on pullback of the
catheter from
the left ventricular into the ascending aorta.
6. Successful PTA and stenting of the left subclavian artery
with two
overlapping stents. Final angiography revealed 0% residual
stenosis and
normal LIMA flow.
7. Arterial extravasation at the forearm without hand ischemia.
Normal
radial and ulnar pulses and no evidence of compartment syndrome.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Diffuse three vessel coronary artery disease with occluded
SVG to D1,
occluded SVG to RPDA and patent LIMA to LAD
2. Left subclavian artery occlusion with PTA/stent x 2.
3. Systolic ventricular dysfunction with a depressed ejection
fraction
of 36%.
4. Successful stenting of the left subclavian artery with two
overlapping stents and normal LIMA flow.

COMMENTS:
1.  Selective angiography of the left subclavian demonstrated
two widely
patent stents with normal flow throughout.  Angiography of the
left
upper extremity demonstrated a an ulnar artery that filled the
left hand
and backfilled the proximal portion of the occluded radial
artery.
2.  Selective angiography of the native coronary arteries
