Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain.
Reason for MICU transfer: urosepsis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 78-year-old gentleman with history of systolic CHF
(LVEF 35%), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, and prostate CA s/p
radical [**Hospital 110597**] transferred from OSH to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
treatment of possible cholecystitis with CTAP concerning for
ureteral obstruction with pyelonephritis. He originally
presented to OSH with complaint of groin pain radiating to the
left flank x1 day. There was associated urinary incontinence,
nausea, dry heaves, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis. At
OSH, he was found to be hypotensive. He was treated with
ampicillin, given 4 liters of IVF, and started on peripheral
dopamine. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
treatment.

In the [**Hospital1 **] ED, initial vital signs were HR 88, BP 88/53, RR 20,
satting 92% on 2L. Labs notable for white count of 19.2 with 18%
bands, ALT/AST of 70/70, normal Tbili, lpase was 16, INR 3.5
(patient takes coumadin as outpatient). UA showed many bacteria,
white count of 21-50 with positive leuk esterase and negative
nitrite. Patient underwent non-contrast CT of the abdomen/pelvis
that demonstrated left ureteral stone with partial obstruction
and perinephric stranding suggestive of pyelonephritis. There
was gallbladder wall thickening, and thus the patient then
underwent ultrasound that showed gallbladder wall thickening and
no other changes to suggest cholecystitis. The patient received
vancomycin and ciprofloxacin, was started on 5 mcg/kg/min
dopamin, and RIJ CVL was placed.  In addition, the patient was
seen by Urology and his Cardiologist was [**Name (NI) 653**], Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 110598**], who agreed that his coumadin anticoagulation was for
AF and could be reversed as necessary, so the patient 2 units
FFP and was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management.
.
Currently, the patient is complaining of mild left flank pain
radiating to his groin. He also endorses shortness of breath and
orthopnea.
.
ROS: As above, otherwise negative.

.
EKG ([**2191-10-30**]):
A-V sequential pacing. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2191-8-11**] no change.
.
Portable CXR ([**2191-10-30**]):
1. Interval development of mild-to-moderate pulmonary
congestion.
2. For better assessment, recommend repeating with PA and
lateral views and better inspiration efforts.
.
CXR s/p Line Placement ([**2191-10-30**]):
Interval placement of a right IJ CVL, but with the tip being
obscured by the overlying pacemaker/ICD catheter. If clinical
concern remains high for potential malposition, recommend
repeating the radiograph with double opaque views.
.
Portable CXR ([**2191-10-30**]):
Indeterminate termination point of the new right IJ CVL.
Recommend repeat lateral view for better assessment.
.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis ([**2191-10-30**]):
1. A 5 mm stone within the left mid ureter without
hydronephrosis, though there is increase in perinephric
stranding on this side. Recommend clinical correlation with UA
for presence of pyelonephritis.
2. Gallbladder wall thickening. Recommend further correlation
with right
upper quadrant ultrasound.
3. Volume loss in the left chest with elevation of left
hemidiaphragm and
consolidation of the posterior portion of the left lower lobe
likely
infection.
.
RUQ U/S ([**2191-10-30**]):
Gallbladder wall thickening without sludge or stones, with a
normal appearing common bile duct. These findings may be related
to CHF,
systemic inflammation, or hepatitis. Recommend clinical
correlation.
.
CXR ([**2191-10-30**]):
The previous dictation requested oblique views if possible to
evaluate the position of the right IJ catheter, since it is
superimposed by pacemaker leads. The current study is again a
frontal view that is
essentially identical to the previous study. Unfortunately, it
is again
difficult to precisely document the tip of the IJ catheter,
which could be
either in the lower SVC or possibly within the right atrium.
Oblique views
or, if possible, lateral projection would be helpful for
precisely documenting the tip of the tube.
.
AXR ([**2191-11-1**]):
Previously seen left ureteral stone is not clearly visualized in
this
radiograph.
.
CXR ([**2191-11-2**]):
Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved but severe left lower
lobe
atelectasis has not. Heart is still moderately enlarged. No
pneumothorax or appreciable pleural effusion. Transvenous right
atrial pacer, right
ventricular pacer defibrillator lead and a third lead probably
right
ventricular as well are unchanged in their respective positions.
Previous
right jugular line has been removed. No pneumothorax.
.
Renal U/S ([**2191-11-2**]):
Mild residual focal caliectasis in the lower pole calyx of the
left kidney without evidence of calculus.
