Comparison to [**2149-12-4**], the Swan-Ganz catheter as well
as the chest tubes are in the left hemithorax, and the
nasogastric tube and endotracheal tube have been withdrawn. The
cardiac silhouette is still slightly enlarged. No pleural

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement. Cannot exclude LAA
thrombus.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD
by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Mildly dilated LV
cavity. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). [Intrinsic LV systolic
function likely depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV hypertrophy. Normal RV chamber size. Normal
RV systolic function.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Simple
atheroma in aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple
atheroma in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple
atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter.
Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets. No valvular AS. The increased transaortic
velocity is related to high cardiac output. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate mitral annular calcification. Calcified tips of
papillary muscles. No MS. Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications.
patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. A left atrial
appendage thrombus cannot be excluded. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.]
3. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. There are
simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic
stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely related
to high cardiac output. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The vena contracta measures
.45 cm. There is both anterior and posterior leaflet retraction
with a dynamic central to posteriorly-directed jet. There is
dilation of the mitral annulus which measures 3.4 cm.
7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. Well-seated annuloplasty
ring in the mitral position. No MR. Normal LV systolic
fiunction. LVEF now 60%. Aortic contour normal post
decannulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted preoperatively. He was seen by electrophysiology
for bradycardia/atrial fibrillation on admission and his digoxin
and atenolol were discontinued. He was also seen by sleep
medicine after periods of apnea were noted preoperatively, and
he will need outpatient follow up approximately four weeks after
discharge. He was taken to the operating room on [**2149-12-4**] where
he underwent a CABG x 1 and MV Repair. He was transferred to the
ICU in critical but stable condition. He was extubated on POD
#1. He was given 48 hours fo vancomycin as he was in the
hospital preoperatively. He was seen by [**Last Name (un) **] for
hyperglycemia, and was started on Lantus. His chest tubes and
wires were pulled without incident. He remained in the ICU
because there were no beds on the floor. He was ready for
discharge to rehab on POD #5.
