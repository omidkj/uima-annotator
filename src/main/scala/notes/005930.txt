Admission Date:  [**2167-2-13**]       Discharge Date: [**2167-2-22**]

Date of Birth:   [**2134-6-23**]       Sex:  F

Service:  ICU

This report covers the date from [**2167-2-13**] until [**2167-2-22**].

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  The patient is a 32 year old female
transferred from an outside hospital for adult respiratory
distress syndrome, poly- and pancreatitis following multiple
ingestions in an attempted suicide.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 32 year old
female with a past medical history of bipolar disorder and
multiple prior suicide attempts who was found unresponsive by
her husband on the [**7-9**].  Multiple empty pill
bottles were noted in her vicinity that included Seroquel,
Motrin, Prozac, and Lamictal.  The patient was taken to the
[**Hospital3 417**] Hospital although aspirated in the ambulance
on the way over.  The patient's toxicology screen on
admission to the [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital was positive for
cocaine as well as ethanol with ethanol level of 128.7.  The
patient had a further episodes of aspiration in the Emergency
Department and was thought to have aspirated charcoal and
gastric contents at which point she experienced acute
respiratory failure and was intubated for hypoxic respiratory
distress.

Her [**Hospital3 417**] hospital course was further complicated by
inability to wean her from the ventilator with worsening
progressive bilateral infiltrates consistent with adult
respiratory distress syndrome, as well as elevation of
pancreatic enzymes in the setting of hypertriglyceridemia at
995 while on TPN and Propofol.  The patient also experienced
persistent fevers despite initiation of broad spectrum
antibiotics that included Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone,
Clindamycin, as well as replacement of her central venous
line.  The patient further experienced and developed ATN that
developed by the [**7-12**] which was treated with
Mannitol and intravenous fluid, diuresis with good recovery
with creatinine on transfer of 0.8.  The patient's
temperature maximum at the hospital was 102.3 F., with blood
pressures that ranged in the 90 to 100s over 60s to 80s.
Pulse is 100 to 110, saturations 95 to 97% on FIO2 of 0.6,
CVP of 810 and Swan-Ganz catheter data obtained on the [**7-11**] showed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)
of 23 to 25 with a PAP of 60/30.

An echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 55%
with mild left ventricular hypertrophy and apical dyssynergy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Bipolar disorder.
2.  Multiple prior suicide attempts, approximately seven.
3.  Obesity.

ALLERGIES:   The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Prozac.
2.  Lamictal.
3.  Seroquel.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Clindamycin.
2.  Vancomycin.
3.  Ativan drip.
4.  Heparin subcutaneously.
5.  Dexamethasone 4 three times a day.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient smokes one pack per day.  She
does use alcohol and cocaine.  She lives with her husband.
She was recently dismissed from a job at a Mobil Gas Station
and has no children.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 99.5 F.;
pulse 94; blood pressure 100/57; respiratory rate of 23; O2
saturation of 97% on assist control with tidal volume of 650,
respiratory rate of 24 and FIO2 of 60%.  In general, the
patient was found to be intubated, sedated, appearing her
stated age.  The patient's pupils equally round and reactive
to light.  She is anicteric.  Conjunctivae are not injected.
Mucous membranes were moist.  No thrush or lesions are
evidence in the oropharynx.  No cervical lymphadenopathy.
Lungs are clear anteriorly and laterally.  Heart rate is
tachycardic although regular without any murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Abdomen is soft, nontender.  The patient grimaces
however with deep palpation.  There are bowel sounds present
times four.  Extremities show no edema.

LABORATORY:  Data from the day of transfer sputum culture
obtained at the outside hospital is white blood cell count of
7.4, hematocrit of 39, platelets 201.  Sodium 137, potassium
3.7, chloride of 103, bicarbonate of 21, BUN of 25,
creatinine of 0.8, amylase of 420, lipase of [**2180**], total
bilirubin 0.5, alkaline phosphatase 51, AST 26, ALT 49.

Arterial blood gas of 7.4/32/65.1 on AC-650/24/80/60% FIO2.

Microbiology data from the outside hospital include from the
[**7-15**] that shows Gram negative rods as well as scant
Gram positive cocci in clusters with rare polymorphic nuclear
cells.  Urine culture on the 20, 23 and 24 were negative.
Blood cultures on the 19th, 23, and 24 were negative.

Chest films demonstrated significantly worsening bilateral
infiltrates.

CT scan of the abdomen at the outside hospital did not
demonstrate any abscess, masses, fluid collection or
pancreatic necrosis, and as mentioned, the echocardiogram at
the outside hospital showed an ejection fraction of 55% with
concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, no effusion, normal
right ventricular function with trace tricuspid
regurgitation.

EKG shows sinus tachycardia, pulse of 101, normal axis and
intervals.  No ST or T segment changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  ADULT RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME:  The patient was
noted to have progressively worsening pulmonary function.
Given her apparent adult respiratory distress syndrome on
chest film, the patient was attempted to be ventilated
according to the adult respiratory distress syndrome
protocol.  CT scan on the [**6-29**] showed extensive
ground glass opacification / consolidation consistent with
adult respiratory distress syndrome.

The patient did not tolerate the rapid respiratory rate and
small target volumes of the ARDS protocol and required
further sedation with fentanyl and midazolam as well as
eventually paralysis with cisatracurium.  The patient was
ventilated according to permissive hypercapnia with a pH
between 7.2 and 7.35, however, the patient was noted to have
worsening pulmonary compliance measured both by recordings
taken through the ventilator as well as by several esophageal
balloon studies.  Despite ARDS ventilation with paralysis
adequate sedation, the patient continued to have worsening
infiltrates fibrosis on chest film with worsening pulmonary
compliance and worsening hypoxia and the patient was given a
trial of prone positioning on the [**6-23**] with little
improvement and returned to the supine position.

As the patient continued to have ongoing fevers (see below)
and as her sputum repeatedly grew out Gram negative rods.
The patient was maintained on empiric antibiotic coverage for
possible ventilator associated pneumonia.  The speciation of
this Gram negative rod is not available at the time of this
dictation although it is a non-lactose fermenting organism
and is not thought to be Pseudomonas.

The patient was covered with Levofloxacin which the isolate
is known to be sensitive to and Zosyn was added on the [**6-24**] for double coverage as the patient continued to have
fever and worsening respiratory status.  Repeat CT scan was
obtained on the [**6-24**] and the results of that scan are
pending at the time of this dictation.

2.  FEVER:  The patient was noted to have ongoing fevers at
the [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital for most of her hospitalization
there.  The patient continued to experience fevers on
transfer to the [**Hospital1 69**] and
further work-up for the etiology of these fevers has been
negative other than for the presence of the Gram negative
rods in her sputum mentioned above as well as one plus Gram
positive cocci in the sputum whose speciation and
sensitivities are pending at the time of this dictation.

Serial blood cultures have been negative.  Urinalysis
revealed only 10,000 to 100,000 yeast and the patient's Foley
catheter was changed; however, she did have zero white cells,
zero red cells on urinary sediment.

As mentioned above, the patient was transferred on broad
spectrum antibiotics that included Vancomycin, Clindamycin
and Ceftriaxone.  The patient was begun on imipenem while in
transfer given the concern for possible necrosis in the
setting of pancreatitis (see below).  The ceftriaxone,
Clindamycin and Vancomycin were initially discontinued,
however, as it b
