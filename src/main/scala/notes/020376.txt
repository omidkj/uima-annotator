History of Present Illness:
78 y/o f with htn, cad s/p mi and pci ([**2178**]), copd (on bipap and
2lnc at home) admitted [**2197-6-1**] to [**Hospital3 **] hospital for a copd
exacerbation (started on methylprednisolone 125mg and nebs),
felt to be secondary to a rll pna, for which she was placed on
levofloxacin, then ticarcillin, then vancomycin for mrsa found
in the sputum.  She became hypotensive and was briefly on
neosynephrine, but weaned off.  During her stay, she fell from
bed and fractured both her left hip and left humeral neck.  The
hip has been surgically repaired by ORIF, but not the humerus,
with post-op delirium (pain meds) and 19pt hct drop (hematoma to
back/thighs [**2-22**] to asa and lovenox use).  During course, also
briefly intubated for hypercarbic resp failure, then weaned to
bipap.  Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management,
where she was found to be in respiratory distress and was
quickly intubated for ventilatory support.

Past Medical History:
1. COPD (2lnc at home)
2. CAD MI/PCI [**2178**]
3. HTN
4. hypothyroidism

Social History:
Pt is a former smoker.  She lives with her son and husband.  [**Name (NI) **]
son describes her as an indepedent person, able to fully take
care of herself prior to this admission.

Pertinent Results:
##
CT head [**6-21**]:
Prominent ventricles, including temporal horns, although not out
of proportion to sulci. Probable atrophy. No evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage.
##
L hip [**6-22**]:
Status post bipolar left hip hemiarthroplasty in anatomic
alignment.
##
L shoulder [**6-22**]:
1) Oblique fracture of the left humeral surgical neck with
medial displacement of humeral shaft. Fracture fragments are
overlapped, as discussed above. The humeral head is inferiorly
subluxed medially rotated. Dislocation cannot be excluded.
2) Lucency at the greater tuberosity, probably a non-displaced
fracture.
##
CXR [**6-28**]:
1) Persisting right upper lobe opacity, which given the clinical
history is likely consistent with a pneumonic infiltrate.
Although less likely, without prior films malignancy remains in
the differential.
2) Bilateral pleural effusions, which allowing for differences
in technique are not significantly changed.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 y/o female with CAD, COPD admitted to osh with copd
exacerbation thought [**2-22**] to pna, fell there with resultant left
humeral and hip fx (s/p hemiarthroplasty of hip), transferred
for furhter management.
1.)Respiratory failure -- Initially hypercarbic respiratory
failure secondary to copd, Mrs. [**Known lastname 62033**] had been extubated at
the outside hospital.  Once admitted, her work of breathing
greatly increased, and her pCO2 rose from a baseline in the 60's
to around 100, and she was re-intubated.  She was slowly weaned
on the vent, with decreasing levels of pressure support.  The
wean was aided by COPD tx (prednisone taper and scheduled
albuterol/ipratropium MDI's) and gentle diuresis.  However, the
patient failed her second extubation attempt despite a bipap
bridge; her failure seemed most related to excessive respiratory
fatigue, probably from a combination of volume overload and
COPD.  At this point, in discussion with the family, it was
decided the best course would be to perform a tracheostomy and
have Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 62034**] be discharge to a rehab facility for prolonged
rehabilitation and ventilator weaning.  At discharge, her
baseline venous blood gas was 7.36/67/33.

2.)Altered mental status -- Per her family, she is clear and
independent at home.  Her AMS was initially due to sedative
medications, but was also from ICU psychosis and her general
ill-state.  She did, at admission, have a CT head that was
negative for any acute pathology, such as bleed or mass effect.
As her sedation was weaned, she was initially started on
haloperidol for agitation on the ventilator, but once she was
trached this became unecessary as well.  By the time of
discharge, she was off of haloperidol and all sedating
medicaitons and was clearing.  She could communicate basically
and follow basic commands.  It is anticipated as her health
improves, she will become increasingly clearer.
4.)Ortho -- Pt is s/p hemiarthroplasty of left hip at the OSH.
Ortho evaluated Mrs. [**Known lastname 62033**] during this admission and said
that due to her ill health and poor nutritional reserve, the
left humerus should be immobilized in [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8688**] brace, and
that she was not an operative candidate.  Following
immobilization, the focus was on pain control, which was
achieved with IV fentanyl.  This was converted to a fentanyl
patch with sc hydromorphone as needed for breakthrough pain.
She will follow-up with the orthopedist she saw while an
inpatient.
5.)Hematoma -- Slowly resolving during the admission, this
finding was from her fall at the outside hospital.  Her hct
remained stable, and the finding, though still present at
discharge, had significantly improved.
6.)Anemia -- Pt had hct drop following procedure, but no other
obvious blood loss source; She was transfused one unit given h/o
CAD.  Baseline anemia mainly related to blood loss into the
hematoma and her ill state with its attendant marrow
suppression.
7.)Guaiac positive stool -- No melena/hematochezia, this was
only a one time finding.  Excepting the drop following procdure,
her hct otherwise remained stable.  She was placed on a [**Hospital1 **] PPI.

9.)FEN -- She was placed on tube-feeds and advanced to goal
without residuals.
10.)Hyperglycemia -- Related to her steroid use, she was placed
on sliding scale insulin that will need to be titrated down at
the rehab as she comes off the taper.
