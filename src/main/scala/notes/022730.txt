Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4654**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 81 year old female w/h/o DM2, Alzheimer dementia, and
hypothyroidism who was brought in from her NH by EMS w/hypoxia.
Per NH report, she had lethargy and decreased po intake last pm;
this AM she was found to be hypoxic to 80-82% on RA.  Per her
daughter, she had been otherwise well. She does note that her
mother seemed "fatigued" the last time she saw her. Otherwise,
denies that she had complained of F/C, N/V/D/abdominal pain, or
chest pain to her knowledge.
.
In the ED, T 99.2 lowest BP 120s/50s max BP 181/57 HR 80s-90s RR
25 initially O2sat 88% on NRB improved to 99% on NRB w/nebs. ARF
to Cr 2.9 from baseline 1.1; cardiac enzymes were elevated w/TNI
0.07. Lactate was 8.0.  She received 2L NS as well as IV
Vancomycin 1g, IV MetRONIDAZOLE 500mg, and IV Cefepime; she
received 10 units of IV insulin and was started on an Insulin
gtt. She was noted to be oriented x 3.
.
Of note, per her last outpt notes, her mental status has been
worsening and she spends much of her day in bed.  She has been
eating less and is completely incontinent and is unable to
complete any ADLs by herself.
.
ROS: The patient is unable to recall why she is in the hospital
and currently endorses thirst, otherwise denies any shortness of
breath, cough, subjective fevers/chills, weight change,
constipation, melena, hematochezia,  orthopnea, PND, lower
extremity edema- "they are always big", urinary frequency,
urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal
weakness, vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

[**2148-12-28**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Suboptimal examination. Large hiatal
hernia. New left lower lobe pneumonia. New right middle lobe
pneumonia vs. atelectasis.

[**2148-12-30**] TTE:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. The
left ventricle is not well seen. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are not well
seen. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's body
habitus. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right
ventricle is not well seen but is probably dilated with normal
function. Probable diastolic dysfunction. No pathologic valvular
abnormality seen. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
81 year old female w/h/o DM2, Alzheimer dementia who was is
admitted for HONC and with associated LLL PNA with evident
hypoxia.  Main items to cont abx below including IV Vanc for 10
days with day 1 [**12-31**] - check BMP on [**1-6**] - if Cr 1.0 or less -
change levoquin to q24h and vanc to q12 - otherwise continue
currently dose.  Wean of o2 as tolerated - cont DM mgmt as
below.
<br>

# HONC/diabetes II, uncontrolled, with complications: Calculated
osm 320 on admission. Presenting glucose 503. Likely
precipitated by PNA. Corrected serum sodium on admission
normonatremic at 139, AG was 26. Pt was initially started on an
insulin gtt which was switched to insulin SC after AG closed on
[**12-30**]. IVF were started with 1/2 NS which were stopped on [**12-30**]
when pt passed speech and swallow and started to take PO.
Electrolytes were checked Q 4hrs which was later spaced out to
[**Hospital1 **] and repleted PRN. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted on day of admission.

-lantus decreased to 30u on [**1-1**] - BS now controlled (started
glyburide on [**1-1**] as well) - ****pm level last pm mod higher
(291) - otherwise overall controlled - [**Hospital1 1501**] to f/u on SSI -
adjust SSI vs long-acting insulin as indicated)
-re-started glyburide at 5mg [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 387**] on [**1-1**]
-Holding metformin with ARF - pt with likely baseline CRI II if
not likely III - may consider d/c long-term - f/u on renal fx
and re-start if appropriate
-cont appreciate [**Last Name (un) 387**] recs - please arrange close f/u in next
1-2 weeks with [**Last Name (un) 387**]
<br>

# LLL PNA: CXR on admission w/evidence of LLL infiltrate. Pt
presented from NH with hypoxia and large A-a gradient.
Initially, she was maintained on a non-rebreather then
transitioned to NC. On transfer out of the ICU, pt with O2 Sat
mid 90's on 4L NC. Pt afebrile since admission, but
w/leukocytosis and bandemia resolving at time of transfer. Pt
was placed on Vanco/Zosyn/Flagyl initially for coverage of
possible aspiration PNA and healthcare associated PND. On [**12-31**],
Flagyl was d/c'd.
-tried checking for sputum cx - however pt unable make any
sputum also none in unit - given cont to clinically improve -
will have to cont vanc given no da
