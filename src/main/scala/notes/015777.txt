[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   78 year old man with s/p cabg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   f/u atx, effusionq



Final Report
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of a patient after CABG.

PA and lateral upright chest radiograph was compared to prior
study obtained
[**2146-7-22**].

Patient is after median sternotomy and CABG. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette
is stable. There is overall improvement in bibasilar opacities
consistent
with atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions
demonstrated, left more
than right, decreased since the prior study. There is no
evidence of
pneumothorax or mediastinal air.

IMPRESSION: Overall improvement in bibasilar aeration with still
present left
basilar atelectasis. Small bilateral pleural effusions, left
more than right.
No pneumothorax. No failure.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2146-7-26**]  12:39:38 PM


Sinus rhythm and frequent atrial ectopy. Low limb lead voltage.
Prior
anteroseptal myocardial infarction. There is T wave inversion in
leads V1-V3
consistent with further evolution of acute anterior wall
myocardial infarction
recorded on [**2146-7-21**]. Followup and clinical correlation are
suggested.

Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness:  0.9 cm  0.6 - 1.1 cm

Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension:  5.0 cm  <= 5.6 cm
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  40% to 45%  >= 55%
Aorta - Ascending:  2.8 cm  <= 3.4 cm
Aorta - Descending Thoracic:  2.1 cm  <= 2.5 cm

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate ([**12-8**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
LV systolic fxn is reduced to an EF of 40 - 45%. The septum,
antero-septal and infero-septal walls are hypokinetic.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
An IABP is seen well-positioned in the proximal descending
aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**12-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
Patient is AV-Paced, on a NTG infusion.
RV systolic fxn is good.
LV systolic fxn is improved to an EF of 45 - 50%. The septum
shows improved motion compared to pre-bypass.
MR remains 1 - 2+.
No AI. Aorta intact.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred in from outside hospital with intra aortic balloon
pump and went emergently to the operating room for coronary
artery bypass graft.  See operative report for further details.
He was transferred to the intensive care unit for furthe
hemodynamic monitoring.  He was weaned from sedation, awoke, and
was extubated in the first twenty four hours.  He remained with
the intra aortic balloon pump until POD 1 due to hemodynamic
instability when it was weaned.  He was started on ACE inhibitor
and IABP was weaned and removed.  Cardiology was consulted for
heart block postoperatively which was second degree mobitz type
1, beta blockers were started and titrated up.  He continued to
do well and remained on the intensive care unit as oral
medications were titrated and he was weaned from vasodilators.
He had atrial fibrilla
