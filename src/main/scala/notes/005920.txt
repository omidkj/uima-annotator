Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 88-year-old man
with a history of coronary artery disease, status post prior
CABG in [**2095**], paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, peripheral
vascular disease, pulmonary hypertension, who presents status
post episode of amaurosis fugax.

In terms of his coronary artery disease, he denies any angina
or need for nitroglycerin.  His last cardiac catheterization
was in [**2101-6-21**] for increased edema.  At that time, his
EF was noted to be 55%.  He had 2+ MR and severe tricuspid
regurgitation.  Angiography revealed native three vessel
disease, a patent LIMA, and occluded graft.  The patient had
an echocardiogram on [**2103-12-24**] which revealed an ejection
fraction of 55%, dilated atria, 2+ mitral regurgitation, 2+
tricuspid regurgitation, significant pulmonary regurgitation.

In terms of his atrial fibrillation, the patient is currently
managed on sotalol and Coumadin.  He was referred for d-c
cardioversion in [**Month (only) 205**], but was found to be in sinus rhythm on
presentation to the [**Hospital1 **].  Since that time, he has been going
in and out of atrial fibrillation.

In [**2104-6-20**], the patient had an episode of amaurosis
fugax of the right eye.  He has not had any further
neurologic symptoms since then.  A CT scan of the patient's
head was negative.  Carotid ultrasounds in [**2104-6-20**]
revealed an 80-99% stenosis of the right carotid.  The left
carotid was without significant disease.  He was referred to
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for carotid stenting.  The patient also
has BOOP and is currently on prednisone 5 mg q.d.  He has
dyspnea when climbing stairs or bending down to pickup
things.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. BOOP.
2. Coronary artery disease status post CABG in [**2095**].
3. Right sided heart failure.
4. Hypertension.
5. Hyperlipidemia.
6. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
7. Peripheral vascular disease/claudication.
8. Pacemaker implantation in [**2095**].
9. Left carotid endarterectomy.
10. Hyperlipidemia.
11. Hypertension.
12. Chronic right loculated pleural effusion.
13. Invasive squamous cell carcinoma of his left vocal cord
status post XRT in [**2093**].
14. Chronic renal insufficiency.
15. Anemia.
16. Transient ischemic attack.

ALLERGIES:  Amiodarone with pulmonary toxicity.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 117/52, heart rate 70.
General:  Patient was alert and oriented in no apparent
distress.  HEENT:  Oropharynx was clear.  Mucous membranes
were moist.  Neck:  Normal thyroid, no appreciable
lymphadenopathy.  Lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm with
2/6 systolic murmur heard best at apex.  Abdomen is soft,
nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Skin:  No
rashes.  Neurologic:  Patient was alert and oriented times
three.  Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  Strength
was [**3-24**] in upper and lower extremities.

ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  Significant for an INR of 1.8.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted for elective carotid
stenting.  He was seen by the Neurology team, who recommended
no further imaging studies of his carotid.  MRI was not
indicated as the patient had a pacemaker.  They recommended
proceeding with the scheduled carotid stenting.  Thus taken
to the catheterization laboratory.

Initial angiography demonstrating 90% stenosis at the
bifurcation of the right external and internal carotid
arteries.  Patient was heparinized.  A CrossSail balloon was
used to predilate the stenosis, then a Precise stent was
deployed across the stenosis.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well with no neurologic incident.

Patient was then admitted to the CCU team for further
observation.  The patient remained asymptomatic, but did have
an episode of hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in
the 80s.  During this time, he was mentating well and was
without complaint.  A Neo-Synephrine drip was started which
brought his pressures up to a systolic pressure of 120.
Neo-Synephrine was then gradually weaned off.  Patient's
blood pressure remained stable and there are no further
events.  It was thus the consensus of the Cardiology team
that the patient was stable for discharge home.

The patient was thus discharged home with a plan for him to
return to see Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who is to restart his
antihypertensive medications.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home.
