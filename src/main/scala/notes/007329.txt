Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 68 yo male with acute MI in pulmonary edema and
cardiogenic shock with severe left main and 3 vessel disease s/p
cath with IABP placed, who was awaiting CABG and then became
septic.
.
# Cardiogenic shock - We continued the IABP, pressors for MAP <
55. Plan was for CABG but this had to be deferred as he became
septic. We continued ASA and statin, heparin gtt.  TEE without
evidence of valvular disease.

#Sepsis: He continued to be hypotensive and swan numbers was
consistent with sepsis. Source was felt to be pneumonia with
MSSA and E. coli, pseudomonas in sputum. He was treated with
zosyn. His cortisol stimulation test was WNL. Then his LFT
bumped and he was presumed to have acalculous cholescystitis. A
gall bladder drain was placed by IR. Meropenum was added to
broaden coverage

#Anemia: He had some nose bleeding. ENT eval'd, packed nose. We
kept his hematocrit >30 with several transfusions.
    .
# DMII - He was maintained on an insulin gtt for BG control.
.
# ARF - His renal funtion continued to deteroiate. Renal was
consulted. Felt to be secondary to ATN or contrast nephropathy.
He was treated with bicarbonate IVF.
.
#Elevated LFTs: GI consulted for possible acalculous
cholecystitis. Gallbladder drain was placed by Interventional
radiology.
.
#Given his poor prognosis, multiple family meeting were had. On
[**2138-5-12**] he ws made CMO and died comfortably with his family at
his side.
