Brief Hospital Course:
70yoF with duodenal ulcer, hx of diverticulosis, bipolarism p/w
nausea, vomiting, blood per rectum.
.
1. GI bleed: Patient had a history of a GI bleed in [**2187-6-10**]
secondary to a duodenal ulcer.  When the patient arrived to the
ED, she received 1Uprbcs and was transferred to the floor.  She
continued to have bloody BM when going to the floor and was
quickly transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring. IN the
ICU, she recieved 3 additional units of prbcs.  She was started
on an IV PPI.  She was prepped for an EGD and colonoscopy which
was done on [**2187-10-7**].  The results of these studies showed a
healing duodenal ulcer and diverticuli with no clots or active
bleeding.  She likely had a diverticuli bleed which stopped on
its own.  GI recommended PPI [**Hospital1 **].  Hct was subsequently stable
and was placed on PO PPI [**Hospital1 **].  Her diet was advanced. UPon
discharge, she was tolerating a regular diet and Hct was stable.
