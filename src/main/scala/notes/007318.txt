[**2113-5-31**] Abdominal Ultrasound: The liver is normal in echo
texture with no focal lesions identified. There is no
intrahepatic ductal dilatation. The common bile duct measures 7
mm in its proximal free segment. The distal common bile duct and
pancreas cannot be visualized. There is appropriate forward
portal venous flow. There is no perihepatic ascites.

[**2113-5-26**] Abdominal CT Scan: 1. Findings consistent with chronic
pancreatitis. No CT evidence of acute on chronic pancreatitis.
2. Essentially unchanged appearance of the pancreas since
[**2106-3-12**]. 3. Pneumobilia. 4. Diverticulosis without evidence of
diverticulitis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Initially admitted under Vascular Service and underwent
successful left carotid stent placement on [**5-18**] by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Postoperatively experienced hematuria related to
traumatic foley placement. He was followed closely by the
urology service which recommended to continue foley catheter
with void trial after surgical revascularization surgery. Over
several days, his hematuria improved. He otherwise remained pain
free on medical therapy. On [**5-23**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed
coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. For surgical details,
please see seperate dictated operative note. Following the
operation, he was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring.
Initially hypertensive, he required aggressive blood pressure
management. He also experienced persistent hyperkalemia which
was intermittently treated with glucose, insulin, kayexelate,
and intravenous lasix. He otherwise maintained stable
hemodynamics and remained in a normal sinus rhythm. On
postoperative day one, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without incident. Early postop, he complained of
nausea and vomiting. Given chronic pancreatitis, he was
initially kept NPO, with nasogastric tube in place and general
surgery was consulted. White count was only slightly elevated.
Pan cultures remained negative. Abdominal ultrasound and CT
scans were obtained which found no evidence of acute
pancreatitis. Over several days, his abdominal symptoms
gradually improved as did his white count and amylase levels.
The NGT was eventually removed and he was started clear liquids.
He made slow but steady progress and eventually transferred to
the SDU on postoperative day seven. Foley was removed and he was
voiding without difficulty. His diet was slowly advanced. As
expected, he continued to experience abdominal pain given his
chronic pancreatitis. He should followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as
an outpatient to continue management of his chronic pain. Prior
to discharge, the pain service was consulted and recommended
Neurontin in addition to his narcotics. His renal function
postop remained relatively stable with creatinine ranging from
1.9 - 2.3. He remained in a normal sinus rhythm without atrial
or ventricular arrhythmias. He continued to make clinical
improvements with diuresis and was eventually cleared for
discharge to home on postoperative day 10.
