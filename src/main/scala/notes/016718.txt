Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5644**]
Chief Complaint:
50M w/ hx obesity, CHF p/w lower abdominal/groin erythema,
swelling.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 25267**] is a 50 year-old gentleman with history significant
for obesity and CHD who presents with chief complaint of
abdominal and scrotal swelling and pain.  Mr. [**Known lastname 25267**] stopped
taking his Lasix several months ago, as he did not appreciate
the frequency with which it caused him to urinate.  Since that
time he has noted gradually increasing swelling in his lower
abdomen.  The region of swelling has appeared irritated and hard
to Mr. [**Known lastname 25267**] at times; he has used Vitamin E lotion, which
sometimes helps.  During the last several weeks, the area has
become increasingly irritated, hard, and painful, and during the
last two nights the swelling extended to his R scrotal sac > L.
He has felt slightly feverish during the last several weeks,
with occasional mild nausea.  He also notes increased shortness
of breath during the last several months, with no acute
worsening.  He denies chest pain, orthopnea, or PND.  He sleeps
on 2 pillows at night, a requirement that has not changed.

Of note, Mr. [**Known lastname 25267**] had a surgery on his R groin approximately 20
years ago at the [**Location (un) **] Hospital.  He recalls that he had
injured a blood vessel while straddling a fence, followed by
erectile dysfunction.  He had what sounds like a vascular graft
bypass repair to restore blood flow to the penis, followed by
resolution of his dysfunction.

On ROS, the patient denies chills, abdominal pain other than
superficially at the irritated region, changes in appetite,
constipation, or diarrhea, dysuria, changes in vision, hearing,
any coriza or sore throat.  He notes seeing some blood in his
stool one week ago, which he attributes to his chronic
hemorrhoids.

swelling has decreased since diuresis last night.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 50M with history of CHF, DM, and morbid obesity who
presented with several months of abdominal swelling and
intermittant lower abdominal tenderness, increasing shortness of
breath, and scrotal swelling.  The patient was diuresed
aggressively, with resolution of the scrotal swelling, and
treated with oxacillin for a presumed cellulitis.  While
in-house, two additional issues came to light: (1) a significant
hypoxia and (2) night-time delerium.  The first was deemed
consistent with obesity hypoventillation syndrome, and the
second was thought related to either Seroquel, hypoxia, or
hypercapnia.  The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course by problem is
discussed below.

1. Volume status

The patient's report of stopping diuretics several months prior
to presentation, along with increasing SOB and lower
abdominal/scrotal edema, suggests that the patient was fluid
overloaded.  JVD is unreliable in a patient with this habitus.
His volume overload might have contributed to his low
saturations if there were pulmonary congestion.  CXR was
difficult to assess, also due to habitus, but suggestive of some
pulmonary edema.

The patient was diuresed with Lasix, with initial doses of 40
early in his stay, and 20 later.  His scrotal edema resolved
with diuresis.  Other factors likely contributing to the scrotal
edema could include the patient's habitus, compressing the IVC;
and a history of R vascular insufficiency due to an old injury,
addressed through a bypass procedure 20 years ago -- which might
explain why the patient's scrotal edema is R > L.  The patient
was fluid restricted and ran approximately 1-1.5 L negative each
day.  By the end of the stay, the patient's weight had declined
by approximately 10 kg.

2. Hypoxia

Mr. [**Known lastname 25267**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3780**] significant baseline hypoxia, with sats
on RA in the low 80s.  He appeared perfectly comfortable at
these saturations, likely indicating a chronic hypoxia.  When
pressed to breath deeply, his saturations on room air would
increase to mid-90s, suggesting a strong hypoventillatory
component to his hypoxia.  On [**2-18**] L O2 by nasal canula, his sats
would go to the low 90s.

At night, Mr. [**Known lastname 25267**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3780**] concerning desaturations,
occasionally to the 70s or 60s.  He was poorly rousable at these
times.  He was attempted on CPAP/biPAP at night, but often
ripped the mask off his face.  Aggressive oxygenation, in fact,
seemed to worsen his mental status at night.  Serial ABGs during
his stay [**Last Name (Titles) 3780**] the following:

10 L O2 by FM: pH 7.29, pCO2 85, pO2 61, HCO3 43.
3 L O2 by NC: pH 7.35, pCO2 71, pO2 57, HCO3 41.
RA: pH 7.37, pCO2 64, pO2 39, HCO3 38.

These data implicated that aggressive oxygenation caused
hypercapnia, consistent with a chronic obesity hypoventillation
syndrome.

Pulmonary was consulted, and suggested a sleep study.  A parital
study to assess for biPAP goals was conducted on the evening of
[**2127-10-9**], and results are commented on in the MICU discharge
addendum.

We strongly recommend pulmonary follow-up with a formal
outpatient sleep study and biPAP for Mr. [**Known lastname 25267**], and have
arranged several appointments to this effect.

3. Cellulitis/panniculitis

Mr. [**Known lastname 25269**] lower abdominal pannus was red, hot, and painful on
admission, implying a cellulitis.  He was afebrile and his white
could was unimpressive.  He was treated with oxacillin.  While
the erythema and induration did resolve somewhat during the
hospital stay, some tenderness remains.  He might have had a
cellulitis, or simply chronic congestions secondary to regional
lymphatic or venous drainage in the region.  He will complete a
10 day course of oxacillin --> diclox as an outpatient.
