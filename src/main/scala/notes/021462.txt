History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 28064**] is a 65 year old man with history of COPD (2 L NC at
night), and CHF who presented after a fall with lower back pain
and shortness of breath.

Patient describes having a coughing fit while leaning over the
dishwasher on the morning of admission and falling back on his
back side. He is uncertain if he lost consciousness. He does not
believe he had any head trauma and denies use of
anticoagulation.  He reports this coughing episode was similar
to his baseline daily cough but that it was accompanied by some
lightheadedness. He reports being in a seated position on the
kitchen floor after his fall and that he was unable to stand up
due to lower back pain.  He denied shortness of breath, numbness
or weakness in his lower extremities contributing to his
inability to stand up initially.  He denied loss of bowel or
bladder function or tongue biting with the fall.  He describes
eventually being able to crawl upstairs to a phone and calling
EMS.  He reports his shortness of breath did not begin until EMS
arrived and they were attempting to help him to a stretcher.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.5 P 94 BP 152/77 R 20 O2 sat
98% RA. Labs were notable for BNP 186, Cr 1.8 (baseline 1.2),
WBC 12.7, Hct 36 (baseline 46), Etoh 56. Preliminary read of
pelvic and lumbar-sacral x-rays were negative for fracture. CXR
revealed mild pulmonary congestion. EKG was negative for
ischemic changes. Patient received azithromycin 500 mg po,
ceftriaxone 1 g IV, albuterol nebs x 6, ipratropium nebs x 6,
methylprednisolone 125 mg IV, lasix 40 mg IV empirically for his
hypoxia and shortness of breath.  He received dilaudid 0.5 mg IV
x 2 for pain control and subsequently vomited and was given
zofran 4 mg IV.

On arrival to the ICU, he reports reports his back pain is
slightly improved but still present. He describes a pain across
his lower back that progresses until he has to change positions.
 He reports his breathing feels near baseline though on arrival
he is on 5L NC and at home he is on room air.  He denies any
chest pain, palpitations, increased orthopnea, recent leg
swelling, fevers, chills, increased sputum production, sick
contacts.  [**Name (NI) **] has no history of calf pain, recent
immobilization, malignancy or VTE.  He does admit to recent
weight gain of the last several months which he attributes to
his increased caloric intake and sedentary life style after
retirement.

IMAGING:
 - [**2187-11-28**] CXR (PA and LAT): As compared to the previous
radiograph there is no relevant change. Moderate elevation of
the right hemidiaphragm with basal areas of atelectasis and
lateral areas of pleural thickening. Diaphragmatic elevation is
not recent and has been present in very similar manner on the
previous examination of [**2186-7-22**]. No newly appeared focal
parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia, minimal retrocardiac
atelectasis. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Tortuosity
of the thoracic aorta. No evidence of larger pleural effusions.
 - [**2187-11-29**] Renal US: No hydronephrosis. No stone or solid mass
seen in either kidney. Bilateral simple renal cysts.
 - [**2187-11-19**] Head CT with no acute intracranial abnormality.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 28064**] is a 65 M with a medical history notable for COPD on
home oxygen at night, CHF with preserved LVEF, alcohol
dependence, and current tobacco use who presented with back pain
from a veterbral compression fracture after a fall. His hospital
course was complicated by a COPD exacerbation (briefly admitted
to ICU for hypoxia though not intubated) and acute renal
failure.

1. COPD: Patient improved with steroids, nebulizer treatments,
and a 5 day course of levofloxacin. He was discharged on a
steroid taper and with home oxygen. On the day of dicharge he
was requiring 2L of oxygen at rest, with O2 saturations of 94%
at rest and 88% with ambulation. He was told to wear 2L around
the clock while at rest and to increase to 3L with ambulation. A
VNA will be monitoring his oxygen saturations after discharge.
The risks of continuing to smoke in general, and smoking while
wearing oxygen, were explained in full. The patient is
pre-contemplative at this time.

2. Acute renal failure: Initially secondary to dehydration on
admission with some improvement with hydration. Secondary
worsening of renal function later in hospital course thought to
be secondary to volume overload and poor forward flow. The
patient was diuresed 2L on [**2187-12-4**] with Lasix 40mg IV x 2 and
his home Metolazone. The following day he was re-started on his
home dose of Lasix 40mg PO daily; his Metolazone was increased
from every other day to every day. He was instructed to have his
electrolytes checked prior to his follow-up appointment with his
PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name11 (NameIs) **] continued to be held throughout this admission.

3. Recurrent vetebral compression fractures: Pain was
well-controlled at the time of discharge. Patient has undergone
vertebroplasty in the past with good effect, and was instructed
to discuss this with his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was advised not to drink
alcohol or drive while taki
