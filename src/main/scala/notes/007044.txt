History of Present Illness:
This is a 85 y/o F w/h/o CAD txfed here from OSH s/p MVA.
Restrained, hit tree. She was on her way home from visiting her
very ill husband in the hospital. She remembers driving, then

Imaging:
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2120-12-19**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensively comminuted fractures of the base of the C2 (type
3 C2 fracture), with 4-mm destruction and retropulsion fragment
indenting the thecal sac. No gross hematoma is noted, however,
the assessment of the spinal cord is somewhat limited, and MRI
will further delineate this abnormality in the spinal canal and
thecal sac. Fracture line extends to the right transverse
foramen, however, the right vertebral artery itself is somewhat
away from the fracture line separated by the fat plane. If
clinically indicated, dedicated vascular study such as CTA or
MRA could be obtained. Degenerative changes.
.
CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS  [**2120-12-21**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pars interarticularis and posterior body of C2
fractures with minimal epidural hematoma not compressing the
cord.
2. The left vertebral artery is largely thrombosed shortly after
the origin with retrograde filling via the basilar artery at the
more distal portion. Given only mild stenosis of the origin of
the left vertebral artery, this occlusion may be an acute event.
3. Calcified atherosclerotic plaques involving the aortic arch
and the common carotid artery and internal carotid artery bulbs
without significant stenosis.
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular
territorial infarct. Left maxillary sinus disease.
.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2120-12-24**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are
consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. There is a small pericardial effusion.
There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the
presence of elevated right sided pressures.
.
EEG Study Date of [**2120-12-24**]
IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG in the waking and drowsy states due to
the
frequent bursts of generalized slowing. This finding is not
specific
with regard to etiology but implies a dysfunction in midline
structures.
Vascular disease is one possible cause. Nevertheless, there were
no
areas of persistent focal slowing, and there were no
epileptiform
features.
.
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2121-1-1**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild congestive heart failure.
2. No evidence of pneumonia or lung mass. Secretions or
aspirated material, left lower lobe segmental bronchi.
3. Atherosclerosis, including coronary arteries.
.
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2121-1-1**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged Hangman's fracture: Bilateral pars interarticularis
and posterior body of C2 fractures.
2. No radiologic evidence for a mass or CVA.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo woman with PMHx sig. for CAD who presents after MVA from
syncope with C2 and sternal fx and found to have L vertebral
artery thrombosis.
.
# C2, sternal fx:  She was evaluated and treated by [**Month/Day/Year 1957**] Spine.
 She was found to have a bilateral fracture of the C2 pars
"Hangmans" fracture, Type 1 or Type 2, and has elected to have
treatment in cervical collar as opposed to halo or surgery due
to several factors including her medical co-morbidities and a
unilateral vertebral artery injury with occlusion.   [**Month/Day/Year 1957**] Spine
has discussed with her that if her fracture does not heal
satisfactorily in the future, surgery may need to be
reconsidered.  She is to wear the neck collar for 8 weeks.
Physical therapy worked with her.  She has elected to follow up
with a local orthopedist in [**Hospital1 **].  An appointment has been
made for her.  Pt was discharged to rehab.
.
# Syncope:  Pt was ruled out for MI upon admission by CEs and
EKGs.  She had no sig. events recorded on telemetry.  She had an
ECHO that showed no outlet obstruction.  She was not
orthostatic.  An EEG showed no epileptiform features.  Neurology
felt that a dissection of the L vertebral artery could have
resulted in thrombosis, resulting in syncope.
.
# L vertebral artery thrombosis:  Pt's neurological exam
remained nonfocal throughout her hospitalization.  Vascular
