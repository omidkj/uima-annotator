Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**]
Chief Complaint:
Distal and proximal tracheal stent granulation tissue and
tracheomalacia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid bronchoscopy, Y stent removal.


History of Present Illness:
60 yo M w/TBM s/p Y-stent placement in [**12-25**] found to have
persistent, moderate stenosis w/granulation tissue around stent
in [**1-22**] admitted from Federal Prison on [**4-1**] to [**Hospital 16843**]
Hospital with MRSA pneumonia and hypoxic, hypercapnic
respiratory
failure complicated by acute congestive heart failure.

The patient was doing okay at prison, with his trach, but using
pessy-muir valve, speaking, eating, breathing okay, until
recently when he developed increased mucus plugging and
shortness
of breath, and so was transferred to [**Hospital 16843**] Hospital (as
above).  There, he was placed on mechanical ventilation for
presumed PNA with LLL collapse (per report) and sputum that grew
out MRSA, and leukocytosis of 12.1.  He was started on
antibiotics (vancomycin), was initially weaned off the
ventilator
but then restarted after mucus plugged.  He underwent
bronchoscopy that revealed granulation tissue distal to the
airway stent in RMS and LMS, along with "dynamic obstruction" of
airway due to TBM distal to the stent.

He also had an NGT placed and was started on tube feeds
(osmolite
1.5), and had a Foley placed to monitor UOP, and a rectal tube
for the development of diarrhea (C dif neg thus far). The
patient
was alos treated for congestive heart failure, as was diuresed
with lasix [**Hospital1 **] (per records not a home med), though his
creatinine did rise from 0.9 to 1.74.
