Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1148**]
Chief Complaint:
dizziness at home

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o female with CAD, A fib, HTN, restless leg
syndrome, with recent [**Hospital1 18**] admissions in [**2-11**]-25 for
viral gastroenteritis. and most recently from [**3-4**] to [**3-6**] for
exacerbation of RLS. During this admission, she presented with
worsening symptoms of her restless legs; subsequently started on
ropinorale (Requip). Was then seen again in the ED on [**3-10**] with
worsening of restless leg syndrome. Subsequently seen by
Neurology in th ED who recommended rapidly uptitrating her
Requip.  Negative LENIs [**2132-3-10**].  Pt not great historian, most
history is obtain through records and geriatrics CM.
.
Now presents after a presyncopal episode while sitting on the
toilet (with the lid down).  She remembers the entire episode.
HHA found slumped on the seat, but conscious and talking.  She
was just distressed because she was weak and could not get up.
Yesterday pt had what sounded like a mechanical fall, while
attempting to walk without her walker. CT head done and was
negative.  When EMTs arrived to site, pt was found to be in NAD,
pale, breathing normally, c/o urticaria both hands, no NVD, no
fevers, no chills, no cough.  + dizziness.  BP was 88/50, hr 68;
bg 101. Apparently, pt had an extensive w/u of her LE weakness
that has been ongoing for at least 1yr.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 31464**], the pt's
neurologist recently ordered MRI LS spine and EMG, which were
abnormal.  MRI was concering for lesions consistent either with
MM or metastatic lesions (this information was passed on from
the geriatric case manager, not known to patient or PCP).  We
don't have the records of those tests.
.
Regarding her hypoxia, she was reportedly found by PT 2 days ago
to be hypoxic with sats in the 80s, but apparently no decision
has been made to send the patient to the ED. Upon the
presentation to the ED, the patient was satting 94% on 5L NC.
Initial VS in the ED:  965, 70; 104/54; 14; 94%5L.  Diffuse
maculopapular, pruritic rash all over trunk and extremities was
noted, that the patient states was 2 days old.  The 2 new
medication started in the beginning of [**Month (only) **] were her
ropirinole for RLS and amlodipine for HTN.
.
Pt is a poor historian but on ROS, denied CP, SOB, stated that
she has "spastic stomach" , no GU discomfort, no dizziness, no
lightheadedness, no palpiations, no weakness, no back pain.  She
complained of diffuse itching.

MICU COURSE:
[**3-23**]: Diuresed. Derm and Rheum consulted; consensus being
hypersensitivity reaction, possibly to drug.
[**3-24**]: Lasix gtt discontinued, started on nitro gtt.
[**3-25**]: Continued nitro drip. Added hydral for BPs. Attempting to
wean O2. Hyponatremia continues. Rash improved.
[**3-26**]: Gently diuresed. Returned hard copies of CT spine to Ms.
[**Known lastname **].
[**3-27**]: Changed steroids to prednisone 60 daily. Increased
hydralazine.
[**3-28**]: Increased hydral to 75 Q6H. D/c topical steroids.
[**3-29**]: Prednisone lowered to 30 daily.

Pertinent Results:
Labs on admission:
.
Imaging:
CXR ([**3-22**]): A single AP view of the chest is obtained on [**2132-3-22**]
at 2240 hours and compared with the prior radiograph performed
the same day at 1155 hours. There appears to be some increased
prominence of the interstitial markings bilaterally above what
has been seen as chronic findings in this patient suggesting
that the patient is developing some interstitial edema
superimposed on chronic interstitial disease. No other changes
noted since the prior examination.
.
CT head ([**3-22**]): No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
EKG ([**3-22**]): Atrial pacing. Prolonged QT interval. Left
ventricular hypertrophy. Since previous tracing, no significant
change.
.
CXR ([**3-23**]): A single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2132-3-23**] at
0530 hours and is compared with the prior evening's radiograph.
There is further worsening of the interstitial [**Doctor Last Name 5926**] since the
prior examination together with patchy alveolar opacities
consistent with developing failure or fluid overload
superimposed on the chronic interstitial changes. There is also
likely a new small right- sided pleural effusion and a possible
small left pleural effusion.
.
CXR ([**3-24**]): Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has improved since
[**3-23**]. Small right pleural effusion persists. Borderline heart
size is stable. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular
pacer leads are unchanged in their respective positions. The
atrial lead is lower in the right atrium than generally seen. No
pneumothorax.
.
ECHO ([**3-24**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The interatrial
septum is mildly aneurysmal. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 11-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-11-30**],
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher. The
severity of aortic regurgitation is reduced (likely mild on
review of the prior study) and the blood pressure is lower.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2122**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate a low risk (prophylaxis not recommended).
Clinical decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be
based on clinical and echocardiographic data.
.
CXR ([**3-26**]): The heart is moderately enlarged. There are no overt
pleural effusions. There is no pneumothorax. Diffuse
interstitial and airspace disease consistent with pulmonary
edema is stable since [**3-25**], but improved since [**3-23**]. Left
pacemaker leads end in the
