Studies:
1. CT abd/pel: New since the prior study of [**2128-11-21**] is
enlargement of the left kidney with heterogeneous enhancement
and perinephric as well as periureteral stranding. Given the
patient's history, these findings are likely from
pyelonephritis. Suprapubic catheter is in place.  No evidence of
bowel obstruction. While collapsed, there is mild stranding
surrounding the right colon, possibly representing nonspecific
focal colitis. Chronic osteomyelitis of right ischial tuberosity
unchanged with adjacent sinus tract. Irregular partially
calcified plaque along the infrarenal abdominal aorta, again
with luminal narrowing down to 8 mm. Findings suggesting
underlying cirrhosis. Splenomegaly unchanged. Suggestion of
paraesophageal varices.

2. CXR: Atelectasis remains in the left lung base. No definite
focal
consolidation is seen concerning for pneumonia.

MICRO:
UCx [**7-4**]: Mixed flora
BCx: [**7-4**]: Coag negative staph (2/4 bottles), Pansensitive
Citrobacter (2/4 bottles)
Stool cx and c diff [**7-4**]: Neg


Brief Hospital Course:
68 yoM w/ C4-C5 quadraplegia presents w/ mental status changes
and tachycardia found to have sepsis and pyleonephritis.

# Sepsis: Pt initially admitted to ICU for aggressive IVF,
antibiotics and pressors (required for 24hs). He quickly
responsed to IVF and was able to be weaned of pressors and be
transferred to the medical floor. The source of sepsis was
thought to be urinary, given suprapubic catheter, multiple
bacteria growing in urine, and evidence of left pyelonephritis
on CT scan. Pt also has chronic ischial ulcer with chronic
osteomyelitis per CT scan which may act as source, but was
evaluated by plastic surgery and not thought to be infection. Pt
grew citrobacter and coag negative staph in multiple bottles of
initial cultures and had multiple surveillance cultures
negative. He was initailly treated with Vanc, Zosyn and Gent,
then switched to Vanc and [**Last Name (un) **] and on discharge to vancomycin
and ciprofloxacin based on sensitivities. These end on [**2129-7-18**].
Pt's suprapubic catheter was changed again in the ICU. For
access pt initially had central line placed and was replaced
with PICC line and several peripheral IVs. Please check Blood
cultures on [**2129-7-24**] after completion of antibiotics to ensure
clearance of bacteria.  PICC line should be removed when
antibiotic course is completed.

# Electrolyte abnormalities: Pt had repeatedly low electrolytes,
including K, Mg, phos, and these were aggressively repleted.
Cause was unclear but appears chronic. Please check chem 10 on
[**2129-7-11**].

# Altered mental status: Resolved, likely due to infection
rather than encephalopathy.

# Pancytopenia: After initial leukocytosis, pt was pancytopenic
with WBC 2s, HCt high 20s, platelets ~50. This was likely due to
sepsis induced marrow suppression and chronic effects of
cirrhosis. Meds were unlikely to be contributing. All cell lines
were increasing at time of discharge.

# Cirrhosis: Etoh induced, longstanding with thrombocytopenia,
INR 1.4, anemia.

# DM2: Pt usually diet controlled, but blood sugars elevated
while in house likely due to infection. He was managed with
QACHS FS and humalog insulin sliding scale.

# Ischial wound: Pt with chronic wound, followed by plastic
surgery as inpt and outpt. Usually with VAC at facility, but
just wet to dry dressings [**Hospital1 **] while inpt per plastics/wound care
recs. Pt to resume VAC when discharged.

# Quadraplegia: Pt was continued on his home regimen of
baclofen, supplements, vitamins, bowel regimen. Keflex for UTI
prophylaxis was held while on other antibiotics.
