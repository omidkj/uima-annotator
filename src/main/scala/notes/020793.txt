Pertinent Results:
ADMISSION LABS & TESTS:

CT Head:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process. Extensive
periventricular white
matter hypodensities most consistent with chronic small vessel
ischemic
changes.

CXR:
IMPRESSION: Interstitial prominence may be in part due to
crowding from low lung volumes, however, mild element of central
vascular congestion cannot be excluded. There is no overt
failure, however. Hypertensive cardiomediastinal configuration
is noted.

A non-occlusive thrombus was found in both the right internal
jugular vein and the right basilic vein. The thrombus in the
right internal jugular is
approximately 0.6 cm in length; both thrombi obstructs greater
than 50% of
their respective vessel. The remainder of the studied vessels
show normal
compressibility and flow.

IMPRESSION: 2 nonocclusive thrombi -- one in right internal
jugular, other in right basilic vein

Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR ADMISSION:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 69 year-old female with history of multiple
recent admissions for catatonia, CAD, dCHF, dementia/psychosis
(baseline oriented X 2) who presented with  altered mental
status from her nursing home.

ACUTE DIAGNOSES:

# Encephalopathy: The patient has been hospitalized on multiple
occasions recently for delirium & unresponsiveness. She as been
worked-up extensively for these episodes without identification
of a clear organic etiology. On this admission, the patient was
tachycardic, febrile, & with intermittent apneic episodes where
she desatted to the 80s.  A head CT was negative & a chest xray
was unremarkable. ABG showed respiratory alkalosis. The patient
was admitted to the MICU where she patient became selectively
responsive to some questions. She was transferred to the general
medicine floor on hospital day #1.  No clear infectious source
was identified.  On the floor, she was seen by psychiatry who
recommended ativan which has worked for Ms. [**Known lastname **] in the
past (ativan 0.5mg every 6 hours).  ECT was consulted but felt
her symptoms had significantly improved & she could continue on
ativan for her symptoms, although ECT may be considered in the
future were her symptoms to worsen.  She was alert & oriented to
self, location, & season at time of discharge.

# Acute Kidney Injury: Creatinine 1.3 on admission which
improved after IVFs to baseline of 1.0.

# Right upper extremity clot:   Felt to be old from prior line
and decision was made that the risks of anticoagulation out
weigh the benefits given patient's frequent refusal to take
medication and possible need for ECT therapy in the future.

CHRONIC DIAGNOSES:

# Depression: Her catatonic-like syndrome on admission resolved
as above.  The patient was discharged on PO ativan.

# CAD: The patient was cont
