possible focal
splenic lesions. Given the timing of the contrast [**Last Name (LF) 1868**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Respiratory:  Ms. [**Known lastname 50155**] was initially admitted to the BMT
unit but was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with progressive hypoxia on
the floor on [**9-8**].  Her O2 sats dropped to 90% on a NRB.  This
was originally felt to be due to a combination of causes: 1) CHF
due to large amt of fluid received via blood products (had 2
units PRBCs, 3 units platelets in prior 3 days), and 2)?
aspiration during her bone marrow biopsy [**9-6**].  She had not been
responding to Lasix on the floor.  Upon admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**],
she improved markedly on BiPAP.  Because she was increasingly
uncomfortable with the BiPAP mask, she was changed back to a NRB
for awhile, and was eventually placed on nasal CPAP.  Overnight
on [**9-8**], she began having increasing hemoptysis, first having
blood-tinged sputum and then coughing up frank blood.  She also
developed worsening diffuse bilateral infiltrates on CXR.  She
was intubated on [**9-9**] so that she could undergo bronchoscopy.
While it was hoped that her intubation was only for the bronch,
she instead required mechanical ventilatory support until
[**2107-9-21**].  The bronch revealed increasingly bloody fluid with
successive lavage, so it was felt she may have DAH (vs a fungal
or bacterial pna).  She underwent a course of high-dose steroids
(methylprednisolone 500 mg IV bid x 6 doses) for presumed DAH.
On [**9-10**], she developed a pneumothorax on the R side that was
moderate sized (R IJ TLC was placed on evening of [**9-8**] with 2
subsequent CXRs not demonstrating a ptx, had bronch [**9-9**], then
had ptx on CXR [**9-10**], so unclear etiology.)  This was treated
with 100% O2 and resolved on its own, not requiring chest tube
placement.  She had another episode of bleeding and underwent
repeat bronchoscopy [**2107-9-14**].  This was also nondiagnostic.  She
was very difficult to wean from the ventilator, and eventually a
family meeting was had with her primary oncologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  It was decided to extubate her and see how she did, and
her family preferred not to have her reintubated if she didn't
do well.  However, she did very well.  She was able to be
transferred back up to the floor on [**9-23**], and was slowly weaned
off her oxygen.  By discharge, she was alternating between room
air and 2 liters O2 per nasal cannula.  She has persistent
patchy alveolar and interstitial infiltrates on CXR, esp in her
LLL.  The etiology of her respiratory failure was never fully
confirmed.  Her [**9-9**] bronch grew out a spore called
sporobolomyces salmonicolor, which both the ID fellow and the
Microbiology lab felt was a contaminant (as it didn't grow out
until [**9-23**]).  She may have had a pneumonia, as she improved on
caspofungin, ceftazidime, and vancomycin.  She also may have had
DAH.  She definitely had at least a superimposed component of
diastolic failure, and she was diuresed aggressively while on
the floor, approximately 1-2 liters per day.  She was originally
on standing Lasix, but by time of discharge she only received
Lasix (20 mg IV) after RBC transfusions.  In terms of the
etiology of her disease, there was also a question of vasculitis
(as she has a hx of polyarteritis nodosum which was reportedly
treated at [**Hospital1 2025**].)  However, her ESR was 18, and house officers
here obtained her records from [**Hospital1 2025**] which consisted only of one
CBC and no notes of an
