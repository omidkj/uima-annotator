Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
left arm weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
MRI/MRA head and neck


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 60498**] is an 83 year old right handed woman with a
history of htn and nephrectomy.  Yesterday evening she had the
acute onset of left arm weakness that she noted when she was
unable to pull her pants up after having a bowel movement.  She
was brought to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED where she was noted to have a left
facial droop, distal > proximal arm weakness and decreased
sensation on the left side.  There was no hemorrhage on CT.  An
MRI/MRA did not show any vascular cutoff but there was an area
of
restricted diffusion and tPA was administered just under the 3
hour mark.  Since then she has had little change in her weakness
or numbness.  She has had brief 30 second episodes of left
facial
twitching which resolved after being loaded on dilantin.

Pertinent Results:
trans-thoracic ECHO:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral
regurgitation.
4. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

MRI/MRA brain:
1) Subacute or chronic infarct involving the right frontal lobe
posteriorly. Followup imaging can be helpful in further
evaluation of this area and assessment of progression of
possible stroke.
2) Moderate chronic small vessel infarct involving bilateral
cerebral hemispheres.
3) Diffuse atrophy.
4) normal MRA brain

Carotid duplex ultrasound:
FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid and
vertebral arteries.
On the right, peak systolic velocities are 71, 69, 52 in the
ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 1. This
is a consistent with no stenosis.
On the left, peak systolic velocities are 85, 76, 69 in the ICA,
CCA, and ECA respectively. The ICA to CCA ratio is 1.1. This is
consistent with no stenosis.
There is antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of stenosis in either carotid or
vertebral arteries.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the Neuro ICU after receiving IV tPA within 3
hours of stroke onset and was transferred to the floor on the
next day.  Patient sustained some improvement in left arm
strength s/p tPA.  She had a follow up head CT which showed no
evidence of hemorrhage s/p tPA.  While in the ICU, the patient
developed focal motor seizures (left facial twitching) and was
loaded with dilantin. An EEG was ordered while the patient was
in the ICU.  The EEG showed sharp waves and slowing in the right
frontotemporal/frontocentral areas and left temporal lobes
suggesting deep midline subcortical dysfunction consistent with
encephalopathy.  The EEG is also consistent with abnormalities
seconardary to a large stroke.  The patient's dilantin level was
routinely checked and was therapeutic on discharge.  She will be
continued on daily dilantin.

Stroke etiology was evaluated with several tests. Carotid
ultrasound was performed which showed no significant hemodynamic
lesions in either the right or left carotids.  Echocardiogram
was performed which showed an EF of 55% and no evidence of clot
or thrombus.  The patient's LDL was 95 and she was started on
lipitor 20 mg daily.  She also ruled out for a myocardial
infarction by three sets of cardiac markers.  The patient was
also started on an aspirin (325mg); on the day of discharge
aggrenox was added and her aspirin dose was decreased to 81 mg.
The patient is to continue with both medications for the next
two weeks and then is to discontinue aspirin and continue on
aggrenox alone.  It is also recommended that the patient be
started on an ACE-inhibitor.  Her beta blocker (metoprolol) was
held in the peristroke period.

Over the course of her hospitalization, the patient's proximal
left arm strength appeared to improve, however she did not
regain any movement in her left wrist, hand or fingers.  Her
left leg strength also improved.

The patient passed the swallow evaluation and she was started on
a full regular diet.  She was evaluated by physical therapy and
occupational therapy and inpatient rehabilitation was deemed
appropriate.  She is to be discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with
follow up in the neurology stroke clinic.
