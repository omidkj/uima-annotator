Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NG tube placement

History of Present Illness:
59yo M w CAD s/p MI, DM, AFib, ? Hep C, CHF with EF 30-35%, ESRD
on dialysis (Tue/[**Doctor First Name **]/Sat), polysubstance abuse, presents with
fever, altered mental status and abdominal pain. He reports
abdominal pain starting Sunday (1 day PTA), associated with
fever, throat pain, nausea and vomiting. He reports using
cocaine on Saturday. He reports a bloody bowel movement on
Sunday and is still passing gas. He had a tooth removed on
Wednesday and has been on Abx for that, but denies significant
tooth pain. He also reports pain in his right shoulder that was
similar to previous anginal pain.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 104 124 162/90 34 85. His BP was
stable, but he was febrile and tachypnic satting 85/RA, and put
up to 100% on a NRB. History was difficult to obtain given
waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status. He had abdominal distension and
pain. Rectal exam with guaiac positive pink mucous. A KUB showed
gaseous distention without frank dilation of small bowel loops,
air/stool seen throughout the colon. Head CT unremarkable. CT
scan with IV/PO contrast showed small bowel distention with no
clear transition point and fecalization of TI, thought to be
Ileus versus partial SBO. He was seen by Surgery who recommended
NG tube placement. NG tube produced a small amount of bilious
contents. A right EJ placed. He had a R 18G PIV, then lost,
replaced with a right PIV in hand. He recieved 2.5 L IVF, Vanc x
1 gm, Ceftriaxone x2 gm, Tylenol, Zofran, 1 mg dilaudid. Prior
to transfer, VS: 103 113 30 18 121/74 100/NRB.
.
On the floor, he was feeling more awake. He continued to
complain of throat, arm, and belly pain. He was thristy.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Fever, chills, headache, cough productive of clear sputum,
dyspnea, shoulder pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
(-) Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied
dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.
.
After abdominal pain, fever, and repiratory distress was
resolved in the ICU, the patient was transfered to CC7.  On the
floor, the patient complained of intermittent 5/10 chest pain.
He said that it was left-sided and worse after eating.  He
reported it to be the same pain he gets with heartburn.  An EKG
and Troponins were ordered to rule out an MI, and they were both
unremarkable and consistent with his baseline.  On the floor, he
had no abdominal pain, was having regular BMs, and was satting
95% on RA.

CT Abd/Pel ([**8-22**]): 1. dilated small bowel measuring up to 3.3 cm
noted to level of TI with fecalization of TI. findings
consistent with ileus vs partial SBO. no transition point
