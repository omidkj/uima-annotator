[**2137-5-3**] CT Head:

FINDINGS:
The previously detailed posterior fossa hyperdensity is now seen
to be choroid
calcification. There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect or
vascular territorial infarction. Hypodensity at the
posteromedial aspect of
the left occipital lobe (2:14) is consistent with
encephalomalacia, likely a
sequela of old infarction. Ventricles and sulci are large in
size and normal
in caliber consistent with parenchymal volume loss.
Periventricular white
matter hypodensity is bilateral and likely the sequela of
chronic
microvascular infarction.

The cranial soft tissues are normal. Mastoid air cells are clear
and
paranasal sinuses are unchanged, with persistent mild mucosal
thickening at
the maxillary sinuses and anterior ethmoidal air cells as well
as frontal
ethmoidal recesses.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Encephalomalacia at the left occipital lobe, the sequela of
an old
infarction as well as parenchymal volume loss.
3. Unchanged mild mucosal thickening in the paranasal sinuses.
<br>

Initial CXR:

FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEW, CHEST: There is diffuse prominence of
interstitial
markings, which is slightly more marked than prior study,
particularly in the
lower lobes. There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion,
or
pneumothorax. Right apical pleural thickening is noted. There is
no evidence
of pulmonary edema. Aortic contour is little bit prominent at
the site of the
ascending aorta. Heart size is normal. Hilar contours are
unremarkable.
Degenerative changes are noted in the vertebral column.

IMPRESSION: Progressive interstitial process, slightly more
marked in the
lower lobes. No focal pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
58 year old man with COPD, chronic HCV infection, polysubstance
abuse including alcohol abuse and related seizures who was
admitted to the ICU for hypoglycemia, alcohol intoxication, and
alcohol intoxication seizure. He also complained of progressive
worsening shortness of breath over the last 3 weeks with out
cough, fever, chills, or chest pain. He had unremarkable CXR. He
was treated for alcohol intoxication and acute COPD exacerbation
and transferred to the floor. He expressed wishes for inpatient
detoxification and therefore social work was consulted; however
initially with limitations for placement given holiday weekend.
He was noted to have acute normocytic anemia with out evidence
of external bleeding. He had recent normal colonoscopy by the [**Hospital **]
hospital. He was never told he had cirrhosis or esophageal
varices; but he does not recall previous EGD or GI bleeding. He
has telangiectasias but no other stigmata of chronic liver
disease. He required no Ativan or other benzodiazepines as he
had no withdrawal symptoms. Despite depression, he had no
suicidal ideation.  Pt treated for COPD - sx stable on day of
d/c with pt to complete steroid taper (finished azithro course
on day of d/c) - d/c to shelter as below while awaiting bed at
