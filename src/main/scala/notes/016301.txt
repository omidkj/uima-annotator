Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2138-10-28**] Mitral valve replacement (33mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Porcine),
Ligation of left atrial appendage

History of Present Illness:
80 yo M with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and known
moderate to severe mitral regurgitation who presented to ED with
dyspnea, cough, and evidence of heart failure. The patient has
experienced progressive orthopnea, cough with blood tinged
sputum and a low grade fever for 2 days. These symptoms are
believed to be related to his mitral regurgitaion. We are asked
to evaluate for mitral valve replacment.

Pertinent Results:
[**10-24**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this right
dominant system
demonstrated single vessel coronary disease. The LMCA, LAD and
Cx had no angiographically significant stenoses. The RCA had a
50% stenosis in the mid-vessel. 2. Resting hemodynamics revealed
mildly elevated right sided pressures with RVEDP of 11mm Hg and
moderately elevated left sided pressures with mean PCW of 25mm
Hg. Cardiac index was preserved at 2.4L/min/m2.
[**10-25**] Chest CT: 1. Perihilar ground-glass opacities, slightly
more prominent on the right, with bilateral small pleural
effusions, likely due to pulmonary edema. 2. Atherosclerotic
calcifications along the aorta and coronary arteries.  Also
mitral annular and aortic annulus calcifications.
[**10-27**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA stenosis
<40%.
[**10-28**] Echo: Pre-bypass: No mass/thrombus is seen in the left
atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler.
Left [**Month/Year (2) 14965**] wall thicknesses are normal. Overall left
[**Month/Year (2) 14965**] systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). This
function can grossly overestimate the real LV systolic function
in the presence of severe MR.
[**First Name (Titles) 167**] [**Last Name (Titles) 14965**] chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. There may be mild aortic stenosis with AV
area of 1.2 or more. The cardiac output in the presence of
significant MR was around 3. The 2D examination of aortic valve
had shown aortic valve sclerosis. These concerns were conveyed
to the surgeon. The presence of low flow aortic stenosis
(?pseduo aortic stenosis could not be ruled out)> Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is partial mitral leaflet flail. An
eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). There is no pericardial
effusion. Post-bypass: The patient is receiving 0.25 mcg/kg/min
of milrinone for inotropic support post-CPB. Overall LVEF is
40%. There is a septal hypokinesis which was conveyed to the
surgeon. There is a well-seated prosthetic valve in the mitral
position with good leaflet excursion and residual mean gradient
of 2 mm of Hg. There is no paravalvular regurgitation. There is
trace transprosthetic regurgitation. Normal RV systolic
function. The left atrial appendage has been excised with a
minimal appendage stump remaining. Aortic valve area was
estimated to be 1.9cm2 after MV repair with a cardiac out put of
4.5L/min. The aorta is intact post-decannulation. All findings
communicated to the surgeon.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known firstname **] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with
shortness of breath and acute on chronic heart failure from
severe mitral regurgitation. He was given the appropriate
medical management including antibiotics for possible underlying
pneumonia. He also underwent extensive work-up, including
cardiac cath, echo, carotid u/s and chest CT. He was eventually
stabilized with medical management and brought to the operating
on [**10-28**] where he underwent a mitral valve replacement on
[**2138-10-28**]. Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. On
post-op day one she was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further care. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were
removed per protocol. He was started on betablockers, diuretics
and an Ace inhibitor was added for blood pressure control. He
was evaluated and treated by physical therapy and was cleared
for discharge to home on POD#4 with VNA services.
