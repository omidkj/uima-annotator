Culture: Tissue L pleural: no growth to date

CXR: [**2104-9-19**]: In comparison with the study of [**9-18**], there is
continued extensive atelectatic change bilaterally, more
prominent on the left. If there are any clinical symptoms
suggestive of pneumonia, the areas of opacification, especially
on the left, would be compatible with this diagnosis. No
evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. There is mild
elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with blunting of the
costophrenic angle.
[**2104-9-18**]:  No evidence of pneumothorax. There is substantially
better inspiration, though diffuse bilateral atelectatic changes
are seen,
more prominent on the left.
[**2104-9-17**]: Extremely low lung volumes. Increased opacifications
at the bases, especially on the right, is consistent with
post-surgical atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting,
the possibility of pneumonia would have to be considered.






Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] Video-assisted thoracoscopy left wound wedges
on [**2104-9-17**].  He was extubated in the operating room, monitored
in the PACU. The patient received 100mg hydrocortisone in the OR
for stress dosing and [**Date Range 1834**] his L VATS lung biopsy without
complications yesterday evening. In the PACU, however, he
experienced respiratory distress and was placed on NRB with O2
sats only 83%. He was then placed on BIPAP with good effect. His
issue was thought to be mostly pain control. He was put on a
dilaudid PCA with decreased splinting and improved O2 sat to 92%
on 4L NC. He was then sent to the floor, where his pain
increased despite 10g dilaudid total. His respiratory status
began to worsen, and CXR showed decreased lung volumes
bilaterally without PTX or hemoTX. ABG was concerning:
7.27/75/80/36/4. Due to his tenuous respiratory status, he was
transferred to the SICU.   In the SICU, he appeared to mostly
have trouble expiring, using his abdominal muscles. He denied
significant pain, and there were wheezes bilaterally. He
improved on BIPAP, and a steroid taper was started.
Events:
[**9-18**] - Admitted with acute respiratory distress. A-line Right
placed. NGT placed for emesis. ABG steadily improving. Requiring
BiPAP and now weaned to high flow O2 2L face tent, much
improved. NGT removed and Left chest pigtail/JP removed.
Shuffled pain meds. D/C Foley, Right A-line out.
Respiratory: Respiratory distress of unclear etiology, likely
reactive airways disease, TBM, pain. Trouble with
expiration>inspiration. On BIPAP initially, now FM 2-6L O2 high
flow. Receiving nebs Q4 and steroid taper. Received
Methylprednisolone 125 mg IV x 1 with Prednisone 80 mg PO Q6
after, weaned to baseline O2 requirement. Improved with
nebs/steroids.
Neurologic: Significant pain postoperatively and history of
significant home narcotic use. Restart home oxycontin 40 [**Hospital1 **],
prn Oxycodone and dilaudid. Restarted MS Contin home dose.
Cardiovascular: Sinus tachycardia and HTN in SICU, on Lopressor.

Gastrointestinal / Abdomen: s/p NGT which has been removed.
Clear liquid diet.
Nutrition: Tolerating clear liquids increased to regular
Renal: MIVF at 85cc/hr. Foley removed. UOP adequate.
Hematology: SQH, no issues.
Endocrine: RISS. Euglycemic.
Infectious disease: No issues at this time. Steroid-induced
leukocytosis noted.
Disposition: On discharge he was on his home dose oxygen 4 L
sats: 96%, Prednisone taper and previous home medications.  He
will follow-up with his pulmonologist and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient.
