Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1234**]
Chief Complaint:
B/L life threatning leg ischemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2163-7-8**]

1.  Left  axillobifemoral  bypass  graft  using 6 mm ringed
    polytetrafluoroethylene.
2.  Re-do/revision.

[**2163-7-9**]

1.  Right femoral thromboembolectomy.
2.  Intraoperative angiogram, performance and S and I.


History of Present Illness:
The  patient  is  a 68 year old male with end stage    lung
cancer   who   has   undergone   a   previous axillobifemoral
bypass graft for lung ischemia.  He presented with  an
occlusion  several  months  ago  but could not have surgery  due
 to  his  chemotherapy regimen.  He now presents with  limb
threatening  ischemia of both legs, right greater than  left.
After  intravenous  heparin therapy and repeat angiogram,  he
was  taken to the Operating Room.  The family and  patient  were
aware of his critical medical condition as well  as  the
possibility  that  even with a revision of his
bypass graft, he may still have the potential for limb loss.


Past Medical History:
Past medical history is significant for lung cancer that is
metastatic to the neck and hilum that is being treated with
chemotherapy and is being monitored by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] from The
Cancer Center of [**Location (un) 86**].

Also past medical history is significant for pancytopenia with
anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia

He also has a history of pericardial infusion with approximately
1200 cc of bloody fluid removed from the pericardial sac in
[**Month (only) 1096**] without recurrence.

Patient's primary care doctor is Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 41246**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], who is
part of [**Hospital6 **] Medical Associates, phone number
is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 30837**].

Past surgical history is significant for laparoscopic
cholecystectomy, exploratory laparotomy for cancer, and
questionable partial colectomy for diverticulitis.

Social History:
pos alcohol remote
tobacco abuse remote

Family History:
non contributary

Physical Exam:
Physical examination upon admit revealed a well-developed and
well-nourished, ill appearing.

His neck was supple without evidence of jugular venous
distention or
carotid bruits.

The heart was sinus tachycardia without murmer
without evidence of murmur.

Lungs scattered rhonchi

Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended
with a well-healed midline scar.

His extremity examination revealed the right lower extremity to
be somewhat cool and paler from the left with decreased
sensation.

echo

PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Pericardial effusion.
BP (mm Hg): 70/40
HR (bpm): 113
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2163-7-14**] at 03:21
Test: TTE(Focused views)
Doppler: No Doppler
Contrast: None
Tape Number: 2003W275-0:0
Test Location: West Echo Lab
Technical Quality: Suboptimal


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality due to poor echo
windows. Emergency  study performed by the cardiology fellow on
call.

Conclusions:
Large somewhat echo dense region around the heart (particularly
the apex)
consistent with an organized pericardial effusion/mass. The
right ventricle  appears compressed. No atrial collapse is seen
(pericardial effusion/mass smaller around the right atrium).

INDICATION FOR CONSULT: INVESTIGATION OF TRANSFUSION REACTION

INDICATIONS FOR CONSULT:
Investigation of transfusion reaction

CLINICAL/LAB DATA: Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68-year-old man, s/p left
axillobifemoral bypass for bilateral lower extremity ischemia.
He
developed fever and respiratory distres during the transfusion
of a
unit of RBC on [**2163-7-13**]. His temperatoure was elevated from 99.3F
to
101.0F. The transfusion was stopped after about 200 ml of RBC
was
transfused. According to the note from nurse and on-call
resident,
before tranfusion, the patient had two episodes of fever
(>101.4) over
the previous 48 hours, and a few hours before transfusion, he
was noted
to have shortness of breath and tachycardia. He was coded and
expired in
the early morning of [**2163-7-14**].

Laboratoy data:
Patient ABO/Rh: O/neg
Unit ABO/Rh: O/pos
Pre-transfusion Hct: 26.7
Post-transfusion Hct: 28.2
WBC: 12.6 K (20% bands)
PT/PTT/Plt: 19.1/73.8/93

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: f/u CHF

CHEST AP PORTABLE: Comparison is made to the prior study
obtained on [**2163-7-12**]. The heart is again noted to be mildly
enlarged. The Swan-Ganz catheter is again noted, with tip in the
right main pulmonary artery. There is no significant change in
overall pulmonary vasculature pattern. There is residual
bilateral lower lobe infiltrate/atelectasis. Again noted is a
bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than left.

IMPRESSION:

Persistent CHF, with bilateral pleural effusion, right greater
than left. There is no significant change from the prior study.

ECG Study

Sinus tachycardia
Low voltage
Incomplete right bundle branch block pattern
Early precordial QRS transition with prominent R wave in lead V2
- consider posterior myocardial infarct of indeterminate age
Diffuse ST-T wave abnormalities with slight ST elevation -
cannot exclude in part injury/ischemia. Clinical correlation is
suggested
Since previous tracing of [**2163-7-10**]: sinus tachycardia rate has
increased.

INTRO AORTA FEM/AXIL

Reason: assess RLE circulation

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
68 year old man with cold right foot acutely
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess RLE circulation
HISTORY: 68-year-old male presents with right cold foot. The
patient is status post right axillary-bifemoral bypass which is
now occluded as seen by duplex ultrasound.

RADIOLOGISTS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] with the attending radiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
[**Name (STitle) **] being present in the entire procedure.

FINDINGS: The angiograms showed occlusion of the abdominal aorta
just below the takeoff of the inferior mesenteric artery ([**Female First Name (un) 899**]).
The celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery and single right
and double left renal arteries are opacified. The [**Female First Name (un) 899**] is
prominent. There are also some lumbar arteries visualized giving
collateral circulation.

On the right, the iliac vessels and common femoral artery are
not opacified. The superficial femoral artery and profunda
femoris are reconstituted just below their takeoff and patent.
The right popliteal artery is faintly opacified but appears
patent up to its bifurcation in the anterior tibial artery and
