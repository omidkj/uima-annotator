Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

REASON FOR MICU TRANSFER: acute hypoxemia, intubated and sedated

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2125-6-22**] - Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage

History of Present Illness:
This 84 year old male with COPD presents to [**Hospital1 18**] after being
transferred from [**Hospital3 **], with hypoxemia.
.
Over the past several months, he has been admitted several times
to [**Hospital6 3105**] and [**Hospital6 5016**] for
shortness of breath at home. He has a known history of COPD - he
has applied for oxygen however has not received approval for it
yet. He has never been intubated in the past for COPD.
.
His current hospital course begins on [**6-3**] - when he
presented to [**Hospital3 **] following worsening shortness of breath
to the point where he was not able to get around at home. EMS
was called requiring intubation in the field. He was treated for
COPD flare and pulmonary edema in the setting of diastolic CHF.
After two days, he was extubated. On [**6-7**] he had a CT scan which
demonstrated extensive multifocal infiltrates in both lungs
especially in right upper and middle lobe. He was started
empirically on Vancomycin, Meropenem, and Levaquin. Following
antibiotics course, his hypoxemia persisted along with
radiographic abnormalities; he was treated with IV micafungin
with concern for superimposed fungal infection (although no
positive culture data). Doxycycline was started to cover
atypical organisms. He was reintubated in the setting of
persistent hypoxemia. However, he then developed hemoptysis;
bronchoscopy revealed clotted blood in lungs but no fresh
hemoptysis. He was reintubated. He was noted to be
intermittently in afib, which his daughter states is new for
him. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

MICROBIOLOGY DATA:
[**2125-6-22**] RAPID VIRAL RESPIRATORY SCREEN - culture pending
[**2125-6-22**] BRONCHOALVEOLAR LAVAGE - 1+ PMNs, no organisms
.
IMAGING:
[**2125-6-24**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - Bilateral asymmetrically
distributed alveolar opacities affecting the right lung to a
greater degree than the left have progressed in the interval,
particularly in the right lower lung and left perihilar area.
Observed findings could be due to clinically suspected pulmonary
hemorrhage, but differential diagnosis is broad, including
pulmonary infection and edema.
Layering right pleural effusion has apparently increased in
size.  No evidence of a left pleural effusion.
.
[**2125-6-20**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP) - The patient is intubated. The tip
of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 2 cm above the
carina. The tube could be pulled back by approximately 1 cm.
there is moderate overinflation with bilateral perihilar
opacities that could represent either centralized pulmonary
edema or pneumonia. The moderate asymmetry of the changes, in
particular the right lung predominance, weighting the
differential diagnosis towards pneumonia rather than edema.
Normal left internal jugular vein catheter. Normal position of
the nasogastric tube, but the tip of the tube is not included in
the image. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette with moderate
tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No pneumothorax. No larger
pleural effusions.

Brief Hospital Course:
IMPRESSION: 86M with a PMH significant for COPD, HTN, CKD who
presented with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring
multiple re-intubations occurring in the setting of presumed
acute COPD exacerbation, acute on chronic diastolic congestive
heart failure, multifocal pneumonia ([**Female First Name (un) 564**] and mold species)
in the setting of alveolar hemorrhage complicated by atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and acute on
chronic renal insufficiency.
.
# ACUTE HYPOXEMIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE - Over the past several
months, the patient had been admitted several times to [**Hospital3 12748**] and [**Hospital6 5016**] for shortness of
breath while at home. He has a known history of COPD - he has
applied for oxygen, however, has not received approval given
insurance concerns. He has never been intubated in the past for
COPD, or required ICU hospitalization.
.
He initially presented on [**6-3**] - to [**Hospital3 **] following
worsening shortness of breath to the point where he was not able
to get around at home. EMS was called requiring intubation in
the field given his acute hypoxemia and labored respiratory
status. He was treated for an acute COPD flare and cardiogenic
pulmonary edema in the setting of known diastolic congestive
failure with IV steroids, fluoroquinolone antibiotics and
diuresis. Following 2-days of treatment, he was successfully
extubated.
.
On [**2125-6-7**] he had a CT scan which demonstrated extensive
multifocal pulmonary infiltrates in both lungs; especially in
the right upper and middle lobes. He was started empirically on
Vancomycin, Meropenem, and Levaquin. Following an antibiotic
course, his hypoxemia persisted along with his radiographic
abnormalities. At that point, his coverage was expanded to IV
Micafungin with concern for superimposed fungal infection
([**Female First Name (un) 564**] and non-specified mold speciating from [**2125-6-15**] BAL
sample). Doxycycline was started to cover atypical organisms. He
was reintubated in the setting of persistent hypoxemia, despite
antibiosis and diuresis. Following his first re-intubation, he
then developed hemoptysis and bronchoscopy revealed clotted
blood in the lungs, but without fresh hemoptysis. Throughout
this, he was noted to be intermittently in atrial fibrillation
with a rapid ventricular re
