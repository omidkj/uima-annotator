[**Name (NI) **] EMS, the patient had a question of blown R pupil,  Kussmaul
respirations and no purposeful movement. He was intubated in
field and transferred to [**Hospital3 7569**]. On arrival he was
hypotensive with no purposeful movements. He was given narcan
6mgIV with no response. CT head was negative per OSH and labs
were significant for WBC 50.2 with 28% bands, glucose 1259 with
AG 35, K 7.2. On ABG 6.88/23/94/4.3/89% and lactate 2.6.

CXR was consistant with multifocal penumonia and question of
aspiration. He received zosyn, unasyn, 4L IV NS, 1 amp Ca
gluconate, 1amp HCO3. Given no intensivist available at [**Location (un) **]
ED he was Transfered [**Hospital1 18**] by [**Location (un) 7622**].

On arrival to ED, patient was hypotensive (83/45, hr 80s),
received 4L IV NS, IV vancomycin and zosyn were started. Insulin
drip at 8U/hr was initiated and FS 780 reported prior to ICU
transfer. Levophed drip was initiated

According to family (ex-wife provided history), he has had
recurrent episodes of hyperglycemia (to the 500s) at home. Last
week he was taken to [**Hospital3 7569**] (by ambulance) for
hyperglycemia where he was admitted for several days. Prior to
this he had teeth pulled and was given pain medications but not
antibiotics. He also recently had a fall and was taken to OSH
for stitches to his head. He is known to have peripheral
neuropathy and takes several types of pain medications,
including a duragesic patch. Otherwise he has not had any other
medical issues or symptoms to her knowledge.

IMAGING STUDIES:
CXR [**2128-1-19**]:Multifocal consolidative pulmonary abnormality,
continues to improve in the left lung since [**2128-1-16**], while
the right lung improved between [**2128-1-16**] and [**2128-1-18**], and
has remained stable or worsened slightly since. Findings are
consistent with pulmonary edema, including noncardiogenic
causes, including ingestion and drug reaction, as well as
pulmonary hemorrhage or unusual condition such as chronic or
acute eosinophilic pneumonia.
------
CT Abdomen and Pelvis [**2128-1-19**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited examination secondary to lack of intravenous contrast
and
opacification of small bowel with oral contrast. Possible short
segment of
small bowel wall thickening in the left mid abdomen. The
differential
diagnosis is broad and includes infectious, ischemic and
inflammatory
etiologies for enteritis.
2. Rectal wall thickening and perirectal stranding suggestive of
proctitis.
3. Ascites and anasarca. Lack of intravenous contrast, limits
sensitivity for
the detection of a small intra-abdominal abscess. No large
intra-abdominal
abscess.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar consolidations and
scattered
ground glass opacities suspicious for pneumonia.
5. Unchanged bilateral n
