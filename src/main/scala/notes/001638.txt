Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Benadryl

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Colonoscopy

History of Present Illness:
84 year-old right-handed man with a history of hypertension,
long-standing diabetes, and atrial fibrillation (not on
anti-coagulation or anti-platelet therapy due to a history of
gastrointestinal bleeding), and chronic kidney disease
(creatinine baseline ~[**1-14**]) who presented earlier today after a
fall with left hip pain; a code stroke was called at 8:13 pm,
after concern for a right MCA infarction on CT of the head.

According to the patient's daughter, with whom I discussed the
case over the phone, the patient was in his usual state of
health until awakening this morning.  At that time, he reported
difficulty seeing multiple objects in the kitchen, including a
kettle on the stove as well as a cup.  He did not further
describe the character of the vision loss.  His daughter thought
that this was unusual in a well-lit room, but attributed the
difficulties from recently awakening, transitioning from the
dark to light.  He did not have any clear weakness, difficulty
with speaking or comprehension.  He has chronic tingling in his
fingers related to diabetes, though no new sensory changes.

At approximately 2 pm, he tripped over a cord as he walked from
the kitchen, and fell forward.  He was able to break his fall
with his hands on a nearby table before landing on the floor of
the study.  There was no observed head trauma nor loss of
consciousness.  He reported pain in the left hip and was taken
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.  Once at [**Hospital1 18**], the patient
underwent a trauma evaluation for his fall.  He was reporting
pain and given 4 mg of morphine  at 5:55 pm for his discomfort,
then 50 mg bendadryl at 6:04 pm for subsequent itchiness.  An
attempt to perform CT scan was made around this time (~6 pm),
but the patient was sent back as he was becoming increasingly
confused and unable to sit still. He subsequently received 1 mg
of lorazepam at 6:42 pm, then developed apneic periods for
~10-15 seconds at a time over a period of 20 minutes, by ED
report.  He received the CT of the head at 7:45 pm and a code
stroke was called at 8:13 pm after a preliminary read of a right
middle cerebral artery stroke.

Review of Systems:
Unable to obtain at this time due to confusional state.

An NIHSS could not be performed due to the patient's confusional

Neurologic Examination:
Mental Status:
Alert and oriented to place and self.  Mildly dysarthric speech
but fluent.  Follows commands.

Cranial Nerves:
Fundi difficult to visualize bilaterally; inconsistent blink to
threat on either side.  Pupils equally round and reactive to
light, 3 to 2.5 mm bilaterally.  Eyes move to the left and
right, but no gaze deviation.  Corneals intact bilaterally, and
face appears grossly symmetric.  Tongue midline and palate
elevated evenly.

Sensorimotor:
Normal bulk throughout, though tone is difficult to assess given
active movement.  No tremor.  He had mild L pronator drift but
full strength otherwise.

Reflexes: B T Br Pa Pl
Right     2 2 2  2  0
Left      2 2 2  2  0
Left toe upgoing, right toe downgoing.

Coordination and gait: Mild dysmetria with FTF more on L likely
reflecting weakness.  Ambulatory with minimal assistance.

HEAD CT [**3-29**]:
1. Acute infarct of the distal right MCA (M3) distribution.
Regional sulcal effacement without midline shift. No
intracranial hemorrhage at this time.
2. Left frontal arachnoid cyst, unchanged.

Carotid US [**3-31**]:
No evidence of internal carotid artery stenosis in their
extracranial portion.

Renal US [**3-31**]:
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis.
2. Small amount of ascites.

MRI HEAD [**3-31**]:
1. Right MCA, superior division, acute infarct.
2. Chronic small vessel ischemic disease.
3. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.

Echocardiogram [**4-2**]:
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 10-20mmHg.There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and severe
global hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %). No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The
ascending and descending thoracic aorta are mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2109-7-16**],
left ventricular systolic function is less vigorous. In the
absence of a history of marked hypertension, the findings are
suggestive of an infiltrative process (e.g., amyloid, Fabry's
etc.)


Brief Hospital Course:
84 year-old right-handed man with a history of hypertension,
long-standing diabetes, and atrial fibrillation (not on
anti-coagulation or anti-platelet therapy due to a history of
gastrointestinal bleeding), presented to ED after a fall and
left hip pain.  Code stroke was called after a head CT
concerning for R MCA infarct and his
examination was limited, given an acute confusional state with
left upgoing toe is the only clear localizing finding at the
time.  He was out of the window for intervention and vessel
imaging and contrast studies were risky given his degree of
renal failure.

Patient was admitted to neurology service and he underwent
pelvis study to rule out hip fracture and renal US to rule out
renal obstruction.  His left lower back pain most likely spasm
s/p fall since he responded very well to small dose Valium and
analgesics.

Although, he initially was quite confused, he improved
significantly with near full strength on his left side except
for mild left facial, left pronator drift and so
