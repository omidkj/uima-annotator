Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] is a 67 year old gentleman who has had multiple
recent hospital admissions for congestive heart failure.  A
subsequent work-up revealed severe mitral regurgitation, severe
tricuspid regurgitation, and 90% occlusion of left main.  He was
therefore recommended for surgical correction of his cardiac
pathologies.

He was taken to the operating room on [**2151-11-22**] with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for a redo sternotomy and off pump CABGx1.  He
tolerated the procedure well and transferred to the surgical
intensive care unit in critical but stable condition.  On the
following day on [**2151-11-23**] he underwent the second stage of his
intervention, a mirtal valvereplacement with a #29 [**Company 1543**]
mosaic valve and a tricuspid valve repair with a 32 CE ring via
a right thoracotomy.  He tolerated this procedure well and was
transferred in critcal but stable condition to the surgical
intensive care unit.

He was extubated on post-operative day 7 after multiple failed
attempts. He was weaned from his pressors, his chest tubes were
removed.  His LFTs were found to be elevated early in his
post-operative course, but these lab values were trending toward
normal by the end of his stay.

By post-operative day 9 he was transferred to the step down
floor.  His epicardial wires were removed.  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
ready for discharge to a rehab by post-operative day 10.
