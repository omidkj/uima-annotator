PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   His physical examination shows his
heart rate to be 58 and in sinus rhythm; blood pressure
154/77; respiratory rate is 14 with an O2 saturation of 99%
on three liters of nasal cannula.  He is in general a
pleasant male who is awake and alert and lying on the
stretcher in no apparent distress.  His lungs have an
increased A/P diameter.  His breath sounds are clear but
diminished bilaterally; there is no wheezing or rhonchi.  His
heart is regular rate and rhythm without rub.  There is a
positive III/VI harsh systolic murmur.  His abdomen is
positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.  Liver
is palpable to 2 centimeters below the costal margin.  There
are no masses and no splenomegaly, no bruit.  Extremities:
Show bilateral lower extremity edema with stasis changes,
left anterior shin dark.  He has no edema and no evidence of
varicosities.  He has no clubbing or cyanosis.  The skin
examination shows multiple well healed surgical scars.  His
neurological examination shows strength to be equal on
bilateral upper and lower extremities.  His pulse examination
shows his carotids to be without bruit on the right and with
a bruit on the left.  His radial artery pulses are two plus
bilaterally; femoral arteries are two plus bilaterally;
popliteal pulses are one plus bilaterally and dorsalis pedis
and posterior tibialis are two plus bilaterally.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count of 8.4, hematocrit of
36.6, platelet count 228,000.  Sodium 137, potassium 3.8,
chloride 104, carbon dioxide 27, BUN 17, creatinine 0.8 and a
blood glucose of 113.   His liver enzymes were all within
normal limits.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2156-9-16**], the patient underwent
a cardiac catheterization which showed an ejection fraction
of 60%; no mitral regurgitation.  His left main coronary
artery was short with moderate calcifications; left anterior
descending artery has proximal moderate calcifications with a
70% tubular lesion at the ostium.  The first diagonal has a
90% lesion at the origin; left circumflex has a 70% lesion at
the origin and 90% lesion at the bifurcation of the obtuse
marginal 1.  The distal left patent ductus arteriosus with
competitive flow.  His right coronary artery is co-dominant
with an 80% lesion at the origin.

A consultation was then put in to Cardiac Surgery for a
possible coronary artery bypass graft and a question of an
aortic valve replacement.

On [**2156-9-17**], the patient underwent coronary artery
bypass graft times four with left internal mammary artery to
left anterior descending artery; saphenous vein graft to left
patent ductus arteriosus; saphenous vein graft to the right
patent ductus arteriosus and a saphenous vein graft to the
obtuse marginal.  He also had an aortic valve replacement
with a #23 millimeter pericardial DE valve.

This surgery was performed under general endotracheal
anesthesia with cardiopulmonary bypass time of 174 minutes
and a cross clamp time of 140 minutes.  The surgery was
performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**] with [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 54443**] and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], PA-C and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], N.P. as assistants.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
to the Surgical Cardiac Recovery Unit with atrial pacing
wires, two ventricular pacing wires, two mediastinal and one
left pleural chest tube.  He was on a Neo-Synephrine drip and
a Propofol drip and paced at 74 beats per minute.

Intraoperatively, the patient had been coagulopathic and had
received 4 units of packed red blood cells and 6 units of
fresh frozen plasma, two units of platelets and protamine.
When he arrived in the Intensive Care Unit, he did receive
more fresh frozen plasma to help control bleeding.

By the morning of postoperative day number one, he was awake,
but agitated.  His ventilator was weaned to extubate.  He was
extubated on postoperative day number one, but throughout the
day continued to have increasing secretions and was
re-intubated.  He subsequently underwent bronchoscopy at the
bedside on postoperative day number two, where it was noted
that he had thick secretions in both the right and left main
stem bronchi.  He was then kept intubated for the following
couple of days, again bronched for copious secretions.

On postoperative day number four, he was extubated without
incident.  During this time that he was intubated, his chest
tubes were discontinued without incident.  On postoperative
day number five, he remained in the unit and had intermittent
periods of confusion and delirium.  He did remain this way
until the following day, but he was thought to be ready for
discharge to the floor.

He was transferred to the Surgical Floor on postoperative day
number six, and continued to be pleasantly confused.  He did
have a Code Purple called on postoperative day number six in
the evening as the patient attempted to leave the floor.  He
was then started on Haldol and was more cooperative by the
morning. Throughout this time, he continued to work with
Physical Therapy and by postoperative day number seven, they
felt that he could be cleared for discharge to home.

By postoperative day number seven, his confusion was present
at times and he still does have hallucinations but he has
been stable and it is felt that he will be ready to be
discharged to home on postoperative day number eight.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   His discharge examination shows his
vital signs to be stable with a heart rate of 71, blood
pressure of 138/71; re
