Cardiac Cath: The peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve
was 60 mmHg. The mean gradient was 52 mmHg. The calculated
aortic valve area was 0.9 mmHg. Selective coronary arteriography
of this right-dominant system
revealed single vessel disease. The LMCA and the LAD were free
of flow-limiting stenoses. The previously placed stent in the
LCX had a proximal 90% instent restenotic lesion. The RCA had an
80% lesion in the major acute marginal branch.
Pre-op CXR: No acute pulmonary process.
