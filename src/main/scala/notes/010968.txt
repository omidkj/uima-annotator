This dictation will cover the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course from
[**2126-6-19**], to [**2126-6-25**].  The remainder of the dictation will
be dictated in an addendum.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient was admitted with the chief
complaint of chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69 year old
male with multiple medical problems including coronary artery
disease, status post several SNTEMIs, congestive heart
failure with an ejection fraction of 15 percent, end stage
renal disease on hemodialysis Monday, Wednesday and Friday,
hypertension, dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  The
patient was in his usual state of health until the morning
prior to admission when he awoke with acute onset of nausea,
vomiting and diarrhea as well as some incontinence of stool.
The morning of admission the patient woke up with shortness
of breath and was diaphoretic and had chest pain.  He
presented to [**Hospital3 4527**] Hospital and was found to have
a CK of 1773 and troponin I of 62.95 and a potassium of 6.1.
He was treated with four Baby Aspirin and was started on
Nitroglycerin drip, was given 80 mg of intravenous Lasix, 10
units of intravenous insulin, one amp of D50, Calcium
Gluconate, Aggrastat and then became chest pain free.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
emergent cardiac catheterization.  This showed a 60 to 70
percent left main stenosis, left anterior descending coronary
artery with a widely patent stent, and in the midvessel,
there was 40 percent stenosis.  The left circumflex had a 50
to 60 percent stenosis at the origin and a previously placed
right coronary artery stent was widely patent.  There was a
totally occluded posterolateral branch and moderate pulmonary
hypertension.  Hemodynamics revealed a pulmonary artery
pressure of 49/28, cardiac output of 2.1 with an index of
1.3, SVR 2667 and pulmonary artery saturation of 39 percent.
No culprit lesion was identified.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, status post
several SNTEMIs, in [**2113**], inferolateral myocardial
infarction, status post percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty of his right coronary artery.  In [**8-3**], he had
right coronary artery stent for 90 percent proximal stenosis.
He was also noted at that time to have three vessel disease
and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 18.  His
ejection fraction at that time was 36 percent.  On [**2126-3-5**],
he had a cardiac catheterization which showed left diffuse
three vessel disease, left main had 60 percent maximal
stenosis, his proximal midvessel left anterior descending
coronary artery had a 50 percent stenosis.  He also had
proximal 60 percent stenosis in the left circumflex.  He also
had 80 percent stenosis in the obtuse marginal two and
diffusely diseased obtuse marginal three.  The right coronary
artery stent that was placed in [**2125**], was widely patent.  He
subsequently had stents of the left circumflex and obtuse
marginal two.  A repeat catheterization was done two weeks
later on [**2126-3-21**], and  at that time he underwent stenting to
his left anterior descending coronary artery.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15
percent.
End stage renal disease on hemodialysis Monday, Wednesday and
Friday.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
History of gastrointestinal bleed.
Anemia.
History of falls.
History of cerebrovascular accident in [**2112**].
Legally blind.
Diabetic neuropathy.
Hypertension.
Dyslipidemia.
History of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.

ALLERGIES:  Shellfish which causes hives.

3. Plavix 75 mg once daily.
4. IMDUR 30 mg once daily.

11.      Calcium Carbonate 500 mg p.o. three times a day.
12.      NPH 20 units q.a.m.
13.      Protonix 40 mg p.o. once daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a former tobacco user.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, temperature is 97.4,
blood pressure 120/54, pulse 70, oxygen saturation 96 percent
on two liters.  Pertinent findings on examination revealed
jugular venous pressure seven centimeters.  He had crackles
in the lateral lung fields.  His heart was regular rate and
rhythm.  His right groin site was without hematoma or bruits.
He had Dopplerable posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  At [**Hospital3 4527**] Hospital before
transfer were remarkable for a potassium of 6.1, blood urea
nitrogen 76, creatinine 11.0, blood sugar 318.  His BMT was
greater than 5000.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Cardiac - There was no culprit lesion
identified on his cardiac catheterization and the patient was
treated medically for a non ST segment elevation myocardial
infarction.  The patient was continued on Aggrastat, Aspirin,
Plavix and Heparin.  The patient was continued on beta
blocker, ace inhibitor.  The patient also had a Swan-Ganz
catheter placed for optimal hemodynamic monitoring and was
started on Natrecor with hopes of improving cardiac output
and indices through afterload reduction.  Because of the
patient's bacteremia (see below), the patient was not felt to
be an optimal surgical candidate at this time.  Additionally,
as the patient had been having rigors (see below), and was
noted to have elevated CKs with flat troponin and MB
fractions, his Lipitor was held.

Renal - The patient was followed by the renal team while in
house and received intermittent hemodialysis.  The patient
initially had a tunneled right subclavian HD catheter which
was subsequently removed due to bacteremia (see below).  The
patient eventually had a subsequent right femoral line placed
for hemodialysis.  Until the patient was transferred to a
medical team, he continued on hemodialysis.

Gram negative rod line bacteremia - The CTU team was called
to see the patient on [**2126-6-21**], at the Dialysis Unit when he
was noted to be agitated and rigoring.  The patient also was
noted to have a gram negative rod bacteremia at that time.
Subsequent culture from the line confirmed the presence of
gram negative rods.  Subsequently the tunneled HD catheter
was removed by surgery.  He was initially started on
Gentamicin for treatment of the gram negative rod bacteremia.
Ceptaz was also added to cover for possible pseudomonal
infection.  Around this time, the patient also had been
complaining of some left shoulder pain.  There was a concern
by the Coronary Care Unit team that the patient could have a
possible septic shoulder.  A rheumatology consultation was
obtained to tap his shoulder.  The shoulder was subsequently
tapped, however, very little fluid was obtained.  Subsequent
analysis from the joint fluid revealed coagulase negative
Staphylococcus.  He also had a blood culture from [**2126-6-22**],
which also grew out coagulase negative Staphylococcus.  The
blood cultures from the catheter tip as well as blood
cultures on [**2126-6-22**], grew Enterobacter Cloacae that was
pansensitive.  The patient also had an abdominal CT to look
for possible intra-abdominal source of his gram negative
bacteremia.  This showed linear atelectasis and scarring at
the left lung base, a 5.0 millimeter nodular opacity in the
right middle lobe.  There were no abscesses identified.  Also
of note, the patient was started on Vancomycin for the gram
positive cocci.  The patient had several urine cultures which
were negative.

Diabetes mellitus - The patient was continued on regular
insulin sliding scale while he was in house.

Mental status changes - From the time the patient was
admitted to the Coronary Care Unit, he was noted to be
intermittently agitated, often combative.  A head CT was
obtained to rule out intracranial bleed as the patient had
recently been on anticoagulation.  There was no intracranial
hemorrhage or acute pathology.  His electrolytes had all been
normal during this time.  The patient was not
