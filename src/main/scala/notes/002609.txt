HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The [**Hospital 228**] medical doctor is
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 452**] (telephone number [**Telephone/Fax (1) 904**]).  His renal
doctor is Dr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 174**].  His history of present
illness is as follows.

This 73-year-old male came in with a chief complaint of
constipation times five days and increase in creatinine.  He
has coronary artery disease and chronic renal insufficiency
and presented with a 4-day to 5-day history of constipation.
He said he had problems with this before; however, this was
more severe.  He reports a decrease in his appetite over this
same period as well as emesis times two.  There was no
fevers, no chills, and no sweats.  He did have some abdominal
pain.  He has tried mineral oil (two doses worth) as well as
Dulcolax without relief.

In the Emergency Department, rectal examination and abdominal
films were unrevealing.  However, because of his increased
creatinine to 4.5 from a baseline of about 3 to 3.5 and
bicarbonate of 18, he was admitted for further workup and
evaluation.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   On review of systems he had low back
pain.  He reported about a 10-pound weight loss over the past
week.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Past medical history is significant
for)
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post an anterior
myocardial infarction in [**2161-11-23**] with a stent to the
left anterior descending artery, percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty to second diagonal.  Catheterization in
[**2161-11-23**]; the proximal right coronary artery was 30%,
distal right coronary artery 70%, proximal left anterior
descending artery 100% with a stent placed, and middle
circumflex with 100%; deemed a poor a surgical candidate
secondary to his history of cerebrovascular accidents.  An
echocardiogram in [**2162-7-24**] revealed an ejection fraction
of 30%, diffuse akinesis, right ventricle was normal, 1+
aortic regurgitation, 1+ mitral regurgitation.  Stress MIBI
in [**2162-5-24**] showed 59% maximum heart rate, partially
reversible anterior defect, fixed apical and cervical
defects.
2.  He also has a history of hypertension.
3.  Dyslipidemia.
4.  Cerebrovascular accident back in [**2162-5-24**].
5.  Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine
of 3 to 3.5 secondary to atherosclerotic renal disease;
formerly has had some end-stage renal disease one and a half
years ago.
6.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
7.  He is legally blind.
8.  He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
9.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy; and elevated
prostate-specific antigen.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies, but ACE
INHIBITORS and [**Last Name (un) **] are contraindicated in this man.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He drinks two drinks per night.  He quit
tobacco in [**2161**] but has a 50-pack-year smoking history by
report.

FAMILY HISTORY:   His family history in this particular
situation was noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   His physical
examination on admission revealed review of systems again
with low back pain.  He was an elderly white man in no
apparent distress.  Alert and oriented times three.
Temperature was 96.7, heart rate of 77, blood pressure
of 182/85, respiratory rate of 18, and oxygen saturation of
97% on room air.  His skin was warm and dry.  The oropharynx
was clear and moist.  The neck was supple.  He had positive
crackles in the right lung base.  First heart sound and
second heart sound.  A regular rate and rhythm.  A 2/6
systolic murmur at the base.  The abdomen was nondistended.
He had positive bowel sounds.  There was no guarding and no
rebound, but tenderness to palpation in the right upper
quadrant and the left lower quadrant.  Rectal examination in
the Emergency Department showed guaiac-negative stool, and he
also had decent rectal tone with an enlarged prostate on
rectal examination.  He had no peripheral edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  His laboratory
values were significant for a white blood cell count of 11.6,
hematocrit of 32.5, platelets of 406, mean cell volume of 91.
SMA-7 revealed sodium of 140, potassium of 4.5, chloride
of 104, bicarbonate of 18, blood urea nitrogen of 42,
creatinine of 4.5, and glucose of 97.  Differential with
83 neutrophils, lymphocytes 6.4, no bands.  His urinalysis
showed specific gravity of 1.02, pH of 5, moderate blood,
nitrite negative, 6 to 10 red blood cells, 3 to 5 white blood
cells.  Urine electrolytes revealed creatinine of 75, sodium
of 114, osmolalities of 462, with a FENa of 4.3.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Abdominal x-ray was negative.  No free
air.  No dilated loops.

Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at 83, left axis
deviation, left ventricular hypertrophy, T wave inversions in
aVL, and changes consistent with an anterior septal
myocardial infarction.  No changes from [**2164-1-16**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was treated according to the
following hospital course:

He was given D-5-W with 3 amps of sodium bicarbonate, and he
was continued on the gentle rehydration, and strict
ins-and-outs were watched.  Over time, the patient's blood
urea nitrogen and creatinine remained essentially stable in
the 4 range, and on the day of discharge he actually dropped
down to a blood urea nitrogen of 37 and creatinine of 3.8;
which was approaching his baseline renal function.  He was to
follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 174**] for further issues related to
management of his chronic renal insufficiency.

In addition, he was started on Epogen 4000 units subcutaneous
twice per week which will be provided by [**Hospital6 1587**] services.

From a gastrointestinal perspective, the patient had
constipation and was treated with an aggressive bowel regimen
including Colace, Senna, lactulose; and he eventually had
bowel movements, and by the time of discharge he had one on
the morning of his discharge; so he will be maintained with
his bowel regimen.  It was thought that his constipation
might have been due to either the chronic renal insufficiency
leading to his not feeling well and not eating much; and
therefore not providing enough bulk as the cause.  Liver
function tests were normal.

From a pulmonary perspective, during the rehydration of the
patient (he came in on [**2-8**]), and on the morning of
[**3-12**], the patient experienced difficulty breathing,
shortness of breath, with a blood pressure of up 210/110,
tachycardic to 110/150, normal sinus rhythm, with a narrow
complex.  Electrocardiogram showed question of ST changes in
V1 through V2.  Chest x-ray was done, and he was given 60 mg
of intravenous Lasix.  A nitroglycerin drip was started, and
a heparin was started without a bolus, and the patient was
given aspirin.  His oxygen saturations were at 78% on 4
liters nasal cannula, and intravenous fluids were stopped.

Pulmonary examination showed decreased breath sounds on the
right side and wet crackles bilaterally, and his skin with
mauled with red and white patches.  So the patient actually
responded to this tr
