Chief Complaint:
fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p intubation
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
77 year-old female with hypertension, renal sufficiency, CAD s/p
CABG ([**2174**]), SVT, diabetes mellitus type II, aortic stenosis
(valve area 1.0-1.2cm2 [**5-16**]), and frequent falls admitted with
fall (30 hours ago). Slipped out of bed Sunday (2am) and was
only able to get to telephone to call for help this morning; no
head trauma; no LOC. In the field, fs 226.

In the ED, initial vs were: 97.8 153 (regular) 133/75 18 100%
RA. Complained of left shoulder pain. Physical examination
notable for appearing dry. Laboratory data significant for HCO3
15 (anion gap 25), glucose 220, WBC 11.8 with left shift, CK/MB
2059/60 with troponin 0.33. Lactate 2.5>1.6 with IVF. Underwent
trauma series with showed no fractures. Intubated for flash
pulmonary edema after 1.5L. ET tube positioning confirmed with
CXR 1V. Received propofol, midazolam, and fentanyl. ABG at AC
500x14, 50%, 5 with pH 7.28, pCO2 45, pO2 325; rate increased to
16. Per cards evaluation in ED, atrial tachycardia; cardiac
biomarker rise suspected secondary to demand ischemia from
atrial tachycardia. On transfer to ICU, 96, 104/54, 16, 98% on

Imaging:
CT Head/Chest/Abdomen: No ICH. No PE. No evidence of RP bleed. R
adrenal adenoma.

SHOULDER (AP, NEUTRAL & AXILLA; HUMERUS (AP & LAT) LEFT; ELBOW
(AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) LEFT
FINDINGS:
LEFT SHOULDER: The humeral head articulates within the glenoid
without
evidence of dislocation. The AC joint appears normal. There is
no fracture.
HUMERUS: There is no visible fracture. There are no focal lytic
or sclerotic lesions.
ELBOW: The radial head and the coronoid and olecranon processes
of the
proximal ulna articulate properly with the humerus. No anterior
or posterior sail sign is seen to suggest fracture.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture or dislocation.

HIP UNILAT MIN 2 VIEWS LEFT PO; KNEE (2 VIEWS) LEFT
FINDINGS:
Three total images of the left femur are submitted. These are
limited
secondary to technique and patient positioning, but are the best
images
possible. No gross fracture is identified, but if clinical
suspicion
persists, then MRI is recommended for further assessment. There
is
tricompartmental osteophytes of the knee with narrowing of the
medial
compartment.

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT Study Date of [**2195-5-25**] 8:57 PM
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in bilateral lower extremity.

cyst.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2195-5-26**] 12:51 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No fracture.
2. Grade 1 anterolistheses at C3-4 and C5-6, which could be
related to facet arthropathy. If there is a clinical concern for
ligamentous injury at these levels, then MRI could be obtained
for further evaluation.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS
W/CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. No PE or acute intrathoracic process. Small bilateral
effusions and
pleural parenchymal scarring.
2. No intra-abdominal hematoma or other acute process. Stable
gallstone,
right adrenal adenoma, and renal cysts.

WRIST(3 + VIEWS) LEFT PORT Study Date of [**2195-5-28**] 5:56 PM
IMPRESSION: There is no evidence of an acute bony injury.

CAROTID SERIES COMPLETE PORT Study Date of [**2195-5-27**] 3:35 PM
IMPRESSION: There is less than 40% stenosis within the internal
carotid
arteries bilaterally.

Cardiac Cath ([**2195-6-3**])
COMMENTS:
1. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LCX stenosis
with a
2.5x8mm Promus stent that was postdilated to 2.75mm. Final
angiography
revealed no residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent
dissection
and TIMI III Flow (see PTCA comments).
2. Successful deployment of angioseal closure device.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal ventricular function.
3. Successful PCI of the LCX.
4. Successful deployment of angioseal closure device.


Brief Hospital Course:
77F HTN, hypertension, renal sufficiency, CAD s/p CABG, SVT,
DMII, moderate AS, presenting to ED with fall and to MICU after
flash pulmonary edema secondary to fluid resuscitation.

#. Hypoxic respiratory failure: Likely due to flash pulmonary
edema in the setting of fluid resuscitation, atrial tachycardia,
and aortic stenosis. Patient was emergently intubated in the ED.
CTA negative for PE. TTE performed showed no evidence of
worsening aortic stenosis. Patient remained intubated, was noted
to be apneic on fentanyl, versed, and propofol, so sedatation
was switched to presodex. diuresed with IV lasix. She was
extubated after 48 hours. Post-extubation she developed stridor.
ENT evaluated the airway, which was notable for mild
inflammation. She was given atrovent and dexamethasone with good
effect. Her respiratory status improved with diuresis.  She was
discharged with daily PO furosemide.
.
#. NSTEMI: NSTEMI from severe CAD s/p CABG (likely various
grafts are down given patient is 20 years s/p CABG) worsened by
demand ischemia from her atrial tachycardia. Patient with ST
