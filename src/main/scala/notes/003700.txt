Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**]
Chief Complaint:
chills, hypoxic episode, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
57 yo M with h/o metastatic prostate cancer presents after
episode of chills and acute SOB. Patient was dx with prostate
cancer 5 yrs ago on routine screening. He had recurrence about 1
year ago, now with known liver and bone met's. Of note, he
started an estrogen based chemotherapy (Estramustine) on Wed. of
last week with concurrent coumadin for possible hypercoagulable
state.
.
Patient had been at baseline prior to 1 day PTA when he
describes first feeling very cold and then developing severe SOB
after walking to bathroom. He attempted to get into bed, but
legs gave out and he fell onto floor. No LOC. Denies chest pain,
fever, leg pain, N/V/D. + leg swelling few weeks ago, but none
recently.  Denies any cough or hemoptysis. He has had nosebleeds
with clots when he blows his nose. Also had hemorrhoidal
bleeding 1 month ago and was admitted for endoscopy.
.
Called EMS and was noted to be hypoxic to 80s on RA, tachy to
150s initially. EMS gave him 40mg IV lasix en route for ? flash
pulmonary edema as he was on lasix at home.
.
In the ED, initial VS:97, 153, 112/68, 100% NRB. Shortly
thereafter spiked to 104 . Noted to have a lactate to 4.2.
Initial CXR was unimpressive, CTA was a suboptimal study but no
large central PE. Recieved levofloxacin/zosyn, 1.5L NS, Zofran
x1 and one unit of platelets. Noted to have guaiac positive red
stool in ED and one episode of hemoptysis. Groin central line
was placed. Given obstructive pattern on LFTs, got non-con CT
abd with no obvious obstruction, only a multinodular liver.
.
Transferred to ICU, transfused 2 units PRBC given low hct, HCT
went up 2 points only and has remained stable.
On interview in the MICU, patient endorses sharp R subcostal
pain this AM, but states that it occurs when he misses his
neurontin and it has not recurred since. He currently denies any
SOB or CP, is comfortable on room air.

IMAGING:
Portable CXR: 1. Low lung volumes which accentuate the
bronchovascular markings.
2. Widened mediastinum, which could in part be due to low lung
volumes and AP technique. However, if clinical concern for acute
aortic syndrome, recommend chest CTA for further evaluation.
3. Hilar prominence may be due to vascular engorgement.
4. Subtle opacities in both lung fields may be due to edema,
infection and/or metastases.
5. Bilateral, right greater than left pleural thickening versus
less likely effusions.

Chest CTA [**2135-10-31**]:
1. Suboptimal evaluation for pulmonary embolus, as above,
although no large, central embolus identified.
2. Extensive osseous metastatic disease due to prostate cancer.
3. Central interstitial thickening in upper lobes may be due to
pulmonary
edema, but given fever, also consider infectious source. Due to
history of
malignancy, malignant component is also possible. Recommend
follow-up to
resolution.
.
CTA chest [**2135-11-2**]
1. No evidence of central pulmonary embolism or aortic
dissection, but
limited study due to timing of contrast and motion.
2. New peripancreatic fat stranding. Clinical correlation for
acute
pancreatitis is recommended.
3. Pulmonary edema vs atypical pneumonia, slightly improved.
Multiple
pulmonary nodular opacities are incompletely evaluated on the
background of ground-glass opacity and a followup chest CT after
the acute pulmonary process resolves is recommended on an
outpatient.
4. 1.6-cm mediastinal lymph node, which may also be reassessed
at the time
of follow up CT.
5. Stable extensive osseous metastasis.
.
ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF 60-70%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CT AB/PELV
1. No evidence of colitis or acute abdominal process.
2. Cirrhosis.
3. Left base small effusion/atelectasis. Upper lobe interstitial
changes; see chest CT.
4. Extensive osseous prostate metastases; e.g. vertebral body
destruction.
.
RUQ U/S:
Innumerable echogenic masses throughout the liver without
biliary
ductal dilatation. This is an unusual pattern for metastatic
prostate cancer, and if appropriate, biopsy can be considered.
.
LENIS
No deep venous thrombosis identified in the lower extremities
bilaterally. Of note, the right common femoral vein was not
interrogated due to overlying dressing.
.
HEAD CT
1. No evidence of hemorrhage, edema or mass effect.
2. No acute fractures are identified.
3. Soft tissue swelling is noted over the left parieto-occipital
region.

Brief Hospital Course:
57 yo M with metastatic prostate cancer (bone, liver mets)
presents with episode of hypoxia and tachycardia, fever after
starting estrogen-based therapy.

#. HYPOXIA/TACHYCARDIA/FEVER: Patient's initial presentation

especially in setting of pro-coagulable state on
estrogen-chemotherapy. Patient had been started on coumadin [**2-20**]
