Allergies:
Celecoxib

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 17865**]
Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: Cough, fever, shortness of breath
Reason for MICU admission: transient hypotension in the ED
(fluid responsive)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 79 yo woman with complex past medical history
(asthma, diastolic heart failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia ?[**2-2**]
MDS) now p/w SOB, cough and fevers (up to 101.5) for 24-48h.
Cough is non-productive. No chest pain, abdominal pain,
palpitations, N/V/D. SOB increased from baseline but responding
to home nebs. Patient also endorsed generalized
weakness/fatigue, to the point where she was unable to reach the
bathroom this am because she could not get out of bed. Also
notes ? LBP with radiation to buttocks/legs, but denies
urine/stool incontinence and loss of sensation. No recent h/o
trauma per daughter.

In the ED, initial vital signs were: T 101.8, P 108, BP 171/72,
RR 24, sat 100% room air. Patient was given acetaminophen,
aspirin, albuterol nebs x3, ipratropium Bromide nebs x3,
vancomycin 1g, piperacillin-tazob 4.5 mg and 2L IVF. On exam,
diffuse wheezes bilaterally > at expiration. CXR and
l-spine/pelvis X-ray showed no PNA, no fractures. CT abdomen
showed no acute intra-abdominal or pelvic abnormalities,
cholelithiasis w/o e/o acute cholecystitis, renal cysts,
diverticulosis w/o e/o diverticulitis. UA was negative.
Laboratory showed a white count of 9.8 with 84% neutrophils,
lipase of 80, lactate of 2.6. EKG showed NSR [**Street Address(2) 35482**]
depressions in the lateral leads (and TWIs - unchanged from
prior [**2123-2-15**]) that resolved to near baseline without
intervention. Cardiac enzymes were negative x2 - six hours
apart. Vitals at time of transfer were T 98, BP 120/65, HR 104,
satting 100% RA. Access includes 2 PIVs.

Of note, patient was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 35483**] to general
medicine service for thrombocytopenia (platelets nadired at 9).
The cause was felt to be ITP secondary to MDS. She was started
on prednisone 60 mg daily with plan to taper over a 15-day
course (this taper ended on [**5-15**]). Patient was to follow-up with
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2148**] in hematology clinic on [**5-27**]. Other events
during that admission were a dropping hct (seen by GI who
recommended outpatient follow-up), fevers with no clear source
(she was treated broadly with vancomycin, Zosyn, and
levofloxacin which were all stopped after negative infectious
work-up), and acute on chronic renal failure (improved with
IVF).

Review of systems:
Patient currently denies headache, photophobia, stiff neck,
chest pain or tightness, shortness of breath, difficulty
breathing, abdominal pain or discomfort, diarrhea or
constipation, nausea/vomiting, or leg pain. Review of systems is
positive for dry cough, which she says started last night.

Brief Hospital Course:
A 79-year-old woman with past medical history of
thrombocytopenia, anemia, asthma, systolic CHF, and chronic
renal insufficiency, recent admission for GIB and ITP, who now
p/w fever and cough.

# Fever/cough: The patient had fevers of an unclear source. CXR
clear. U/A and urine cx negative. Blood cx with no growth. She
was empirically treated with Vancomycin/Zosyn in ED, but these
were not continued after admission, and she never had any
further fevers. She was ruled out for influenza with viral DFA.
She was kept on bronchodilator nebs given the wheezes on exam.
Additionally, she was started back on high-dose prednisone with
plan for continued course of 40mg daily until she sees her
hematologist in 10 days.

# Hypotension: The patient had transient hypotension in the
emergency room that was fluid responsive. Given that she just
finished a 15-day course of high-dose steroids, adrenal
insufficiency was considered, but was ruled out with a normal AM
cortisol of 15. TSH was also normal. Infectious workup negative
as above. Patient was given small boluses of IVF on the first
hospital day and her hypotension resolved, with no further
interventions needed. As above, predisone was restarted at high
dose (60 mg daily), and she was discharged on 40mg daily until
outpt followup.

# Thrombocytopenia: In the setting of myelodysplastic syndrome
and recent admission for ITP, her plt counts have improved. She
had a recent course on prednisone 60 mg daily, with last dose
approx [**5-14**]. Her platelets had nadired at 9 and were 27 at the
time of discharge [**2123-4-29**], but rebounded to over 100 during this
admission. Steroids continued.

# Eosinophilia: Patient with diagnosis of ?myelodysplastic
syndrome (see heme/onc note from [**2123-1-19**]) and worsening
eosinophilia despite treatment for two weeks with high-dose
steroids. She is also an asthmatic. No further work
