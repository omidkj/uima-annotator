Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion/Diminished exercise tolerance/ intermittent
angina

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2131-11-29**] Aortic valve replacement (19mm St. Juse tisse),
Coronary artery bypass graft x 1 (Saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal)

History of Present Illness:
75 year old female with a history of aortic stenosis which has
been followed by serial echocardiograms. Recently she has become
symptomatic with a markedly diminished exercie tolerance and
dyspnea on exertion which were new symptoms. An echocardiogram
was obtained which showed severe aortic stenosis with an
increased mean gradient. A stress test earlier in the year
showed poor exercise tolerance with slight ST depressions. In
preparation for surgery, a cardiac catheterization was obtained
which showed a 60% circumflex stenosis. Given the progression of
her disease and symptoms, she has now been referred for aortic
valve replacement and surgical revascularization.

Pertinent Results:
[**2131-11-29**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
POST CPB: 1. Preserved [**Hospital1 **]-vewntricular systolic function. 2.
Prosthetic valve identified in aortic position. It is well
sr\eated and stable. Normal lealfet motion. There is mild
perivalvular reguragitation. Unable to obtain gradients across
the aortic valve due to poor transgastric windows. 3. No other
change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 20677**] was a same day admit and on [**11-29**] was brought to
the operating room where she underwent an aortic valve
replacement and coronary artery bypass graft x  Please see
operative note for surgical details. Following surgery she was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. She initially woke with some right sided neglect
which resolved on POD1 with no residual focal deficits.  She was
agitated initially post op and self extubated on POD1.  All
narcotics were discontinued for lethargy and Zyprexa was given
once for delirium.  Her mental status slowly improved over the
next several days and she was neurologically intact at the time
of discharge.  On POD 2 chest tubes were removed with some
bleeding at chest tube sites requiring sutures in the right and
middle site with resolution of the bleeding. On POD 3 she went
into rapid atrial fibrillation with subsequent hypotension and
was briefly started on Neosynephrine and converted to sinus
rhythm on an Amiodarone drip.  She was given a unit of blood for
a hematocrit of 23 and weaned off pressors.  AFib resumed and
she was placed on
Coumadin.
On POD 4 the patient had an episode of amaurosis fugax of the
right eye.  This was associated with right temporal headache and
jaw claudication.  Additionally, ESR and CRP were elevated.  She
does have a history of temporal arteritis.  Rheumatology,
Ophthalmology and Vascular Surgery were consulted.  High dose
steroids were initiated.  Vascular Surgery did not feel that
temporal artery biopsy was warranted given the chronicity of her
symptoms and that she's had a right sided temporal biopsy in the
past.
Rheumatology feels strongly that the patient should be treated
empirically, and that she may have been incompletely treated for
her previous episode.  She was placed on PCP prophylaxis in the
setting of high dose steroids.  Visual symptoms resolved and the
patient will follow up with her Ophthalmologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient.
