Service:  NSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 52-year-old woman
who was in her usual state of health until [**2181-7-22**] when
she was at a community fair and complained of a headache.
She was unable to express herself and collapsed.  She was
taken to a local hospital where she was initially alert and
oriented.  Became somnolent.  She had a head CT which showed
subarachnoid hemorrhage.  She became more somnolent and was
intubated en route for airway protection.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital **] Medical Center ED.  Her vital signs on
presentation:  166/76, heart rate 59, respiratory rate 16,
sats 100 percent.  On exam, she was intubated, awake.  Pupils
were 2 down to 1 mm bilaterally.  She was following commands
and moving extremities times 4.  She was agitated on the
ventilator and was therefore started on propofol drip.  She
was given 100 grams of Mannitol.  Blood pressure remained in
the 160s.  She was started on a Nipride drip.  She was loaded
with Dilantin and transported to [**Hospital1 190**] for further management.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She was intubated, with no spontaneous
movement, unresponsive.  HEENT:  Anicteric.  She had an
endotracheal tube in place.  Neck was supple.  Lungs:  Clear
to auscultation anteriorly.  Cardiovascular:  Distant heart
sounds, regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  No clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema.  Neuro:  Mental status - Unresponsive to
verbal stimuli, slight grimace to pain, does not follow
commands.  Cranial nerve:  No blink to threat.  Pupils equal,
round, reactive to light; conjugate gaze; no doll's, no
corneal, no facial asymmetry, no gag.  Motor:  Slight
withdrawal of the left lower extremity greater than upper
extremity and no spontaneous movement.  Sensory:  Withdraws
to pain times 4.

LABORATORY DATA:  CT shows subarachnoid hemorrhage with no
hydrocephalus and no ventricular blood.  She had a
spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage, most likely aneurysmal
bleed.  She was still unresponsive but recently treated with
Versed and vecuronium before transport.  Sedation was
discontinued.  She had a CTA of the head.  She was started on
nimodipine, continued on Dilantin.

Off sedation, patient was examined today.  Her exam was much
improved.  She was awake, alert, following commands, pupils 2
mm and sluggish.  She had positive corneas, positive blink to
threat, withdrew all 4 extremities briskly with stimulation
and moved extremities to command.  She localized the pain.
CT again showed subarachnoid hemorrhage, left greater than
right, with no hydrocephalus.  CTA:  Question of fullness of
the A-comm.  Patient had a ventricular drain placed and was
taken for angio.

Patient underwent a coiling embolization of a ruptured A-comm
aneurysm on [**2181-7-24**] without complication.  The patient's
drain was opened at 10 cm above the tragus, and her blood
pressure was kept less than 130.

Post coiling, her exam:  Pupils were 2 down to 1.5, she
opened her eyes to command, wiggles her toes easily to
command, weak grasp bilaterally with much encouragement,
blood pressure was kept less than 130.

On [**2181-7-25**] the patient was taken to the Operating Room for
clipping of a second non-ruptured aneurysm on the A-comm
artery.  Patient tolerated the procedure well, without
complication.  Postop, vital signs are stable.  She was
awake, alert, following commands, moving all extremities,
able to show thumbs up, prior CP was 9 to 10, CBP 10 to 11.
She was monitored again in the ICU.

On [**2181-7-26**] the patient was extubated.  She was awake,
alert, following commands, moving all extremities.  Her blood
pressure was increased to the 150 to 160 range, and she was
seen by the Cardiology Department due to having episodes of
tachycardia and 1.4 second pauses and escaped beats.

On [**2181-7-26**] patient had a head CT that showed decreased
size of ventricles compared to [**2181-7-24**].  Patient has
remained stable, was out of bed with P.T., started on a
regular diet.  Blood pressure continued to be in the 140 to
160 range, and goal CBP 10 to 12.  Patient still having
episodes of SVT.  Cardiology recommended just watching it.
Patient had adequate escape beat to get her out of the
rhythm.  Patient was also treated with flecainide for the
runs of  SVT and given intermittent doses of metoprolol and
labetalol for episodes of SVT.

Vascular Surgery was consulted on [**2181-7-30**] for placement of
an IVC filter.  A temporary filter was placed and the patient
tolerated the procedure well, without complication on
[**2181-7-30**].  Patient continued to have episodes of SVT, and
flecainide was increased to t.i.d.  The patient was ordered
for a TTE.  Patient's echo showed a decreased EF thought
maybe secondary to neurocardiogenic effect of the hemorrhage.
Flecainide was stopped and the patient was treated with
amiodarone.

Patient's neurologic status continued to remain stable.  She
was awake, alert, oriented times 3, with no drift.  Strength
was [**3-21**] in all muscle groups on [**2181-8-1**].  Continued to
have frequent bursts of SVT.  On [**2181-8-1**] the patient was
taken for angio for assessment of aneurysm clipping and she
was assessed for vasospasm.  Patient did have diffuse
vasospasm, moderate, in the right MCA/ACA region and left
MCA/ACA region.  Triple H therapy was continued, although
patient's EF was low.  The patient was requiring large
amounts of Neo-Synephrine to keep her blood pressure in the
appropriate range.  The patient was started on albumin but
went into respiratory distress and required intubation on
[**2181-8-2**].

Chest x-ray on [**2181-8-2**] showed bilateral consolidation.
Head CT on [**2181-7-31**] was stable.  She was started on
dobutamine and continued on amiodarone and metoprolol for her
runs of SVT.

On [**2181-8-1**] the patient had Enterobacter in her urine.  She
also had gram-positive cocci in her CSF.  Infectious Diseases
was consulted on [**2181-8-4**] due to the gram-positive cocci in
the CSF.  Patient is also currently on Zosyn for broad
coverage for pneumonia and on vancomycin for treatment of
shunt infection of the CSF.  Patient was started in
intracecal vancomycin.  The vent drain was removed and a
lumbar drain was placed.  Despite problems with intubation
and pneumonia, the patient's neurologic status continued to
remain stable.  Patient was moving all 4 extremities,
following commands, pupils were equal, round, and reactive to
light.

On [**2181-8-7**] patient had a head CT which showed evolution of
subarachnoid blood with no hydrocephalus.  Lumbar drain was
draining 10 to 15 cc an hour and patient continued on
vancomycin and Zosyn for antibiotic coverage.

Patient was extubated on [**2181-8-8**].  Chest x-ray showed mild
CHF.  Head CT was stable.  Patient continued on Zosyn for
pneumonia, continued on vancomycin.  Patient was transferred
down to the Step-Down Unit on [**2181-8-10**].  Neurologically,
she remained stable, continuing on the Zosyn.  Vancomycin was
discontinued and ampicillin 2 grams q. 6. Started.  Coag-
negative staph on the shunt tip is most likely with
contamination.  Patient was awake, alert, and oriented times
3.  Face is symmetric.  She had no drift.  Her strength was
[**3-21**] in all muscle groups.  She was seen by physical therapy
once she arrived on the floor, was out of bed, ambulating.

On [**2181-8-12**] ID recommended discontinuing the Zosyn and
starting ampicillin.  Nimodipine was discontinued on
[**2181-8-13**].  The patient had neurologically remained stable
and is ready for transfer to rehab.
