CT Head:
Motion-degraded study. No intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect,
or fracture. Mucosal thickening and fluid within the left
maxillary sinus. Opacification of the left frontal and several
ethmoid air cells, possibly inflammatory in origin.
.
CXR:
ET and NG tubes in appropriate positions. Scoliosis.
.
EKG: Sinus rhythm. Normal tracing. No previous tracing available
for comparison.
.
CTA Chest ([**8-24**])
CONCLUSION:
1. Streak artifact due to body habitus and atelectasis at the
lung bases compromised the diagnostic ability of the scan,
within these limitations, there is no central pulmonary
embolism. There is no aortic dissection.
2. Bibasal effusions and pericardial effusion are present.
3. Atelectasis is present at both lung bases with patchy
opacities in the lung parenchyma, likely infectious or
inflammatory.
.
Difficult cross-match:
DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Ms. [**Known lastname 59365**] has a new
diagnosis of an anti-E antibody. E antigen is a member of the
Rhesus
blood group system. Anti-E antibody is clinically significant
and is
known to cause hemolytic transfusion reactions and hemoluytic
disease of
the newborn. In the future, Ms. [**Known lastname 59365**] should receive E-antigen
negative blood products for all red cell transfusions. In
Caucasian
populations, approximately 71% of all otherwise ABO compatible
blood
will be E-antigen negative. A letter and a wallet card stating
the
above information will be sent to the patient.

MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2153-9-4**] 4:38 PM
There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, shift of
normally midline structures, or evidence of acute infarcts.
There are several scattered small FLAIR/T2 bright
periventricular white matter lesions, consistent with chronic
small-vessel angiopathy. There is no hydrocephalus. There is a
mucus retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus. There is
mucosal thickening of several ethmoid air cells. Surrounding
soft tissue structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute ischemia or intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Several small (less than 5 mm) periventricular white matter
lesions consistent with chronic small vessel changes.
3. Mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus and several
ethmoid air cells.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2153-9-1**] 4:29 AM
FINDINGS: The examination is limited by motion and exclusion of
a portion of the right hemithorax. The endotracheal tube is no
longer visualized, and the nasogastric tube also appears to have
been removed. A right subclavian venous access catheter appears
to be in unchanged position, although the tip is poorly
visualized due to motion. The heart size and mediastinal
contours are grossly unchanged, as are bilateral interstitial
and bibasilar opacities and small left pleural effusion. The
right pleural effusion is not evaluated due to exclusion of a
portion of the right hemithorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
30 y/o F with unknown PMH who presented after being found
unresponsive. Positive for cocaine, opiates and alcohol,
intubated for airway protection
.
# Mental Status Changes/Unresponsiveness:  On admission the
patient had been found down and was intubated.  Etiologies
considered included acute intracranial processes, hypoglycemia,
toxic/metabolic insults, infection, ingestions and cardiac
etiologies.  CT of the head was negative for hemorrhage or mass.
 CXR and urine were without evidence of infection.  EKG was
unremarkable.  Toxicology screens positive for opiates,
benzodiazepines, cocaine and ethanol making toxic insult likely.
 Blood cultures and urine cultures were all negative.  Sputum
cultures grew group A strep but were otherwise negative.  She
received one dose of activated charcoal given her positive
toxicology screen and concern for other ingestions.  She did not
respond to narcan which suggested that she may have taken other
sedating drugs.  She received thiamine to prevent against
Wernicke's encephalopathy.  She was given folate and
multivitamins.  She was sedated with fentanyl and midazolam
given concern for withdrawal. Over the course of 48 hours she
became more responsive and agitated on her ventilator requiring
increased sedation.  She was changed to propofol as this would
allow for rapid reversal and extubation.  Once extubated she was
intermittently aggitated, which was treated initially with
haldol and ativan and then transitioned to valium dosed for CIWA
score>10.  this improved aggitation considerably.  She was also
was started on a methadone taper which was brought down to 10mg
IV q12h.  This was tapered down over the next 4 days at 25 % per
day.  Her agitation improved and on the medical [**Hospital1 **] she did not
require any sedatives for agitiation.
.
# Ataxic gait, dysarthria, disconjugate gaze and mild fine motor
deficits of right hand: After extubation she was noted to have
some difficulty managing to eat with her right hand, slurred,
dysarthric speech, and disconjugate gaze.  These were of unclear
chronicity as she had been unresponsive on presentation.  This
was discussed with her mother, who stated that the pt. had never
had disconjugate gaze, speech was more slurred than baseline,
and that pt. had not had difficulty with rt. hand in past.  On
arrival to the medical [**Hospital1 **] after extubation, these issues
persisted despite mild improvement in functionality and
ambulation/mobility, and the patient
