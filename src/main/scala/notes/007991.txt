Date of Birth:   [**2113-8-11**]     Sex:  F

Service:  Inpatient [**Hospital1 139**] Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 29-year-old female
with a history of recurrent acute pancreatitis approximately
once a month since undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy
[**2142-2-16**], who is presenting now with worsening right
upper quadrant pain x4 days.  The patient was previously seen
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3315**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 47768**] in [**2142-5-10**] for similar
symptoms.  She has had multiple studies including CT and
MRCP, which showed pancreatic dilatation in the past.  An
ERCP was performed on [**2142-5-14**], which demonstrated mild
diffuse common bile duct dilatation and a sphincterotomy was
performed without resolution of symptoms.

The patient was referred for further workup including a small
bowel follow-through, which was negative and a CFTR study,
which was negative.  The patient was recently admitted to
[**Hospital 1281**] Hospital for severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
fevers, and chills.  During that hospitalization, her amylase
and lipase were not elevated.  CT scan of the abdomen showed
no pancreatic ductal dilatation.  Patient was started on
pancreatic enzymes and given Carafate.

After discharge approximately three weeks ago, the patient
has progressively gotten worse with symptoms much worse over
the last three days after a large meal.  She states that she
is unable to tolerate p.o. and has subjective fevers, chills,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, and fatigue.  Her pain
is characterized as a knife and sharp cramping and it is a
[**2149-8-18**] up from her baseline of [**2149-3-14**].  She had bright red
blood per rectum approximately four days ago.  She has had a
cough productive of greenish sputum for which she has been
taking Levaquin x1 week.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. History of dilated common bile duct status post
sphincterotomy in [**2142-5-10**], which did not improve her
pain.
2. Status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy in [**2142-5-10**].
3. History of pancreatitis with multiple hospital admissions
most recently one month at [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital, complicated by
pancreatic ductal dilatation.
4. Hypothyroidism.
5. Anxiety.

7. Migraines.
8. Asthma.
9. Endometriosis diagnosed by exploratory laparotomy.
10. Manic depression.
11. Status post appendectomy.
12. Status post right ovarian cystectomy.
13. Status post knee surgery.
14. History of systolic dysfunction with an EF of 40-45% and
echocardiogram performed at [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital in [**2142-5-10**]
showing anteroseptal hypokinesis.

ALLERGIES:  Latex which causes scars.  Sulfa and Demerol,
which causes hives.  Vicodin, codeine, Percocet, and
vancomycin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient does not drink and quit smoking
10 years ago, but previously smoked two packs per day.  She
is currently on [**Social Security Number 47769**]social security due to her disability and is
married with one child.

FAMILY HISTORY:  She has uncles with diabetes, grandparents
with cancer, father with cardiovascular accident at age 26,
and mother and father with [**Name2 (NI) **].

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Vital signs:  97.3, 91/63, 100, 16, and 98%
on room air.  In general, the patient is awake and alert in
no apparent distress, lying in bed.  HEENT exam:  Pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light.  Sclerae are anicteric.
Mucous membranes are moist.  Chest was clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm.  Abdominal
examination is soft, mild right upper quadrant tenderness to
palpation, mild right lower quadrant tenderness with
palpation, no rebound, no guarding, and no hepatomegaly, and
positive bowel sounds.  Rectal exam:  Small amount of reddish
stool, which is guaiac positive, although the patient is also
menstruating and it is difficult to separate whether the
bleeding is coming from her stool or from menstruation.
Extremities:  No lower extremity edema.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  Show a white count of 14.6.  Her
amylase is 60, lipase is 26.  Remainder of laboratories are
within normal limits.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Right upper quadrant pain:  The patient had been seen at
[**Hospital **] Clinic on the day of admission.  They felt that her
symptoms were possibly related to pancreatitis and was sent
over to the ED for admission.  However, on admission her
amylase and lipase were within normal limits.  From previous
hospital records obtained from [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital, it is known
that the patient has had prior episodes of pancreatitis,
which have presented with elevated amylase and lipase.

The patient has had multiple recurrent attacks of acute
pancreatitis, although it is unclear whether the patient has
such chronic pancreatitis that she has burned out her
pancreas and that her amylase and lipase do not elevate even
though she has pancreatitis.

The patient underwent a right upper quadrant ultrasound to
evaluate for biliary duct dilatation.  It showed no intra or
extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  There was mild
prominence of the common bile duct with normal tapering.
There was no stone or filling defect in the common bile duct.
She had normal kidneys, normal spleen, and normal pancreas.

Given her recent history of cough, a chest x-ray was obtained
to determine if she possibly had a right lower lobe
pneumonia, which was producing this right upper quadrant
pain.  However, chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia.
In addition, she had been started on levofloxacin for
possible pneumonia.  There was also question raised of
whether this was cholangitis, however, the patient was
afebrile and there was no evidence for biliary duct
dilatation on right upper quadrant ultrasound.

A GI consult was obtained for assistance with deciphering the
cause of her right upper quadrant pain.  They recommended
MRCP for further elucidation of the patient's biliary duct
anatomy.  MRCP showed no biliary duct dilation in the liver.
Her common bile duct was 8 mm, which was dilated, but yet
normal for someone who has undergone cholecystectomy.  She
had small bilateral pleural effusions.

Further hospital records from [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital were also
obtained.  A CT scan obtained at [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital on [**2143-3-3**] showed prominence of part of the pancreatic tail
without acute changes.  The appearance was stable.  There was
diffuse fatty change of the liver.  GI felt that this
prominence of the pancreatic tail was normal and did not
represent pancreatitis.

The GI fellow called Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 47769**], who had previously
been involved in the patient's ERCP.  He stated given a
completely normal MRCP, there was no indication for
sphincterotomy.  In addition, she had previously received a
sphincterotomy, which should not lead to resolution of her
abdominal pain.  There was no indication for ERCP.  A gastric
emptying study was obtained to determine if there was any
evidence for gastroparesis, however, gastric emptying was
normal.

Given thus far extensive negative workup, GI consult
recommended further outpatient management.  The patient
should follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3315**] from the [**Hospital 13721**]
Clinic or Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1586**] [**Name (STitle) 2161**] for outpatient secretin test.  They
recommended advancing her diet to low fat low residue as
tolerated.  The patient should be started on Viokase with
meals, when she is taking good p.o.  She should also be
restarted on her pancreatic enzymes (Lipram three tablets
p.o. with meals) when the patient is taking better p.o.  She
should also be on ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d., which will
help increase the pH in order to activate her pancreatic
enzymes.

2. Anemia:  The patient was admitted with a hematocrit of 42.
She was note
