Palpitations

History of Present Illness:
44 yo male with history of HTN presented to his PCP today
complaining of weakness, intermittent fatigue, and occassional
cough for one week.  Over the past 2 days, he has had trouble
lying flat and has slept sitting in a chair.  He reports
palpitations; feels like his heart is "beating like racehorse,"
but denies dizziness, or lightheadedness.  Reports that
palpitations will last for few seconds and then self resolve.
He denies CP, but reports orthopnea.  Also reports worsening
dyspnea on exertion. In the past was able to walk long distances
without any SOB, but in the last few days the patient reports
that he has not been able walk more than ten minutes for the
last two days without stopping [**1-23**] shortness of breath.  The
patient denies ever having shortness of breath.  Of note, the
patient also reports developing a dry cough, mostly during the
day.  Started this past Wednesday.  Denies any recent
fevers/chills, no sick contacts.
.
Of note, he has not been taking lisinopril and HCTZ for past 6
months, as he reports not knowing he needed to continue these.
He reports occaisional NSAID/ibuprofen use for headache. Reports
that [**Last Name (un) **] has been his "second home."
.
Patient was first noted to have hypertension in [**2150**], initially
started on HCTZ 25 mg daily, and then lisinopril 10 mg added on.
 The patient has not been compliant with his medications; also
has had dietary indiscretions, even after being counseled about
the importance of low salt diet and exercise.
.
At [**Company 191**], he was found to have a HR in 150-160's with a narrow
complex SVT seen on EKG.  Vagal maneuvers were attempted but
were unsuccessful.  BP at the time was 150/100.  He was sent to
the ED for further evaluation of his tachycardia.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, initial vitals were 98.0 120
170/160-200/130 18 100% on unclear amt of oxygen.  Exam revealed
markedly elevated JVP, diffuse crackles, abdominal distension,
and [**12-23**]+ pitting edema.  EKG revealed a narrow compelx
tachycardia.  At 4pm, 12mg of adenosine was given through a
small right hand PIV, with conversion to sinus tachycardia at
140.  IVF were started for tachycardia with total 1.5L given.
At 6pm, he was still tachy to the 180's with another dose of
adenosine 12mg given.  He reverted to sinus brady at 50-60 for
10 seconds, then went back into sinus tachycardia.  CXR was
obtained and revealed volume overload so IVF were stopped.
Bedside TTE revealed no effusion.  EP was consulted and felt
this was likely acute heart failure [**1-23**] hypertension and SVT [**1-23**]
atrial stretch.  They recommended lasix 20mg x2, nitro gtt, and
bipap for recruitment.  RT started CPAP instead.  Vitals prior
to transfer: 139 142/102, 20, 100% on CPAP.
.
On review of systems, denies any abdominal pain, n/v/d, changes
in BM, denies any urinary sx, no blood in stool.

Relevant EKGs:
1. [**2154-10-31**]: Supraventricular tachycardia at 163 beats per
minute with a short R-P interval configuration. Left ventricular
hypertrophy with T wave inversions in  lead aVL and ST segment
sagging in leads I and V5-V6. Minimal J point elevation in the
inferior leads with inconsistent ST segment depression,
possibily artifactual in the inferior leads. ST segment
flattening in lead V4. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
2. [**2154-11-1**]: Sinus rhythm. Left ventricular hypertrophy. Left
atrial abnormality. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2154-10-31**]
sinus rhythm has replaced the supraventricular tachycardia. Left
ventricular hypertrophy is unchanged. T wave inversions in leads
I and aVL are improved. Non-specific ST segment flattening is
now prominent in the inferior leads and unchanged in the lateral
leads.  QRS morphology in the precordial leads is again
different consistent with alteration in precordial electrode
placement.
3. [**2154-11-2**]: Sinus tachycardia versus atrial tachycardia. Left
ventricular hypertrophy with secondary repolarization
abnormalities.
.
TTE ([**2154-11-1**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
There is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 30 %) with regional variation; the inferior free wall is
akinetic. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An eccentric,
posteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its
severity may be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect).
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

intraparenchymal renal arteries could not be adequately assessed
