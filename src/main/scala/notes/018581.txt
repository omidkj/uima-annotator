Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP and sphincterotomy

History of Present Illness:
62 yo male with hx of CAD s/p CABG, ischemic CMPY, and gallstone
and pancreatic stone pancreatitis who presented to OSH with
abdominal pain transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP now s/p
sphincteromy but aborted pancreatic duct stone removal. Prior to
recent presentation pt was treated with ERCP in [**7-17**] for
pancreatic stones which they were hesitant to attempt to remove
given his cardiomyopathy so he was manage expectantly. He
represented to OSH on [**2165-2-14**] with increasing adominal pain in
his epigastrum radiating to his chest. He had negative CE, but
amylase and lipase were elevated to 319 and 3209, respectively.
CT scan showed no acute abnormalities with coarse calcifications
in the pancreatic head with calcified gallstones. He slowly
improved with central line placement, TPN and NPO with
advancement to clears, and he was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP
vs laproscopic surgical therapy for definitive treatment. He was
initially reluctant to have a procedure due to his cardiac risk
but was seen by cardiology who felt his risk was not
unreasonable and the patient was agreeable. Of note during his
OSH stay he developed a cough with LLL infiltrate on CXR so was
started on CTX and azithromycin changed to vancomycin. Pt
tolerated his ERCP well on [**2164-2-28**] during which he received 3.1L
of crystaloid. The procedure was difficult and pancreatic stones
were unable to be removed although extensive sphincterotomy was
performed. He had severe nausea and abdominal pain post
procedure so given risk of ERCP induced pancreatitis in pt with
poor LV function he was tranferred to the ICU for close
post-procedure monitoring.

[**2165-2-27**] ERCP:
1. Localized continuous congestion of the mucosa was noted in
the first part of the duodenum
2. Cannulation of the bile duct was performed with a
sphincterotome using a free-hand technique.
3. The common bile duct was normal.
4. There were gallstones seen in the gallbladder
5. A biliary sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock
position using a sphincterotome.
6. Cannulation of the pancreatic duct was performed with a 5-4-3
tapered catheter.
7. Large impacted stones could be seen in a highly irregular
pancreatic duct in the head of the pancreas.
8. We were unable to traverse the stones with a guidewire.
9. A pancreatic sphincterotomy was performed using a
sphincterotome.
10. Pancreatic fluid mixed with stone fragments were seen
following the pancreatic sphincterotomy.


Brief Hospital Course:
62 yo male with hx of CAD s/p CABG, ischemic CMPY, and gallstone
and pancreatic stone pancreatitis who presented to OSH for
abdominal pain transferred for ERCP now s/p sphincterotomy but
aborted pancreatic duct stone removal.
.
## Abdominal pain: Patient received uneventful sphincterotomy
after presenting to OSH with symptoms consistent with acute
pancreatitis. The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **].
Given instrumentation and dye injection into the pancreatic duct
during ERCP, the pt was at increased risk of ERCP-induced
pancreatitis. He was therefore transferred to the ICU for
further monitoring.  The morning following the procedure, the
patient was completely asymptomatic without any complaints of
abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.  It was therefore requested
that he be transferred back to his initial hospital for further
watchful waiting. It was also discussed, given his improved
cardiac function on a recent study, whether surgery would be an
option for treating this disease.  However, this decision will
be deferred to his primary physicians.
.
## Cardiomyopathy: Recent imaging study suggested improving pump
function. He diuresed well on his own following the procedure
without need for any diuretics. His ace inhibitor and beta
blocker were restarted the morning following his procedure.
.
## Coronary artery disease: No evidence of ischemia over the
course of admission. Not on aspirin apparently since starting
warfarin at time of TIA in [**2158**].  Warfarin was held with the
possibility of further procedures in the near future.
.
## COPD: No documented PFTs in our system, although does have
significant smoking hx. Sounded more bronchospastic on exam
during admission. He was continued on albuterol, ipratropium as
needed.
.
## Pneumonia: Recently completed 10-day course of Zosyn. No
clinical evidence of pneumonia currently.  He was not treated
with antibiotics following his procedure.
.
## TIA: On warfarin as an outpatient, although reason is not
entirely clear as there is no evidence that patient has atrial
fibrillation. Likely fewer bleeding events with aspirin with
similar secondary prevention benefit.  He was not restarted on
aspirin or warfarin as described above, however, this should be
addressed with cardiolist/PCP at later time.
