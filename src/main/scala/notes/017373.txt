Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] hospital for possible open lung biopsy


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central line placement

History of Present Illness:
71 yo female with pmhx sig for dx of IPF, severe MR, CAD, COPD,
hypothyroidism who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation for
open lung biopsy and possible valve replacement/ CABG after
undergoing treatment for dyspnea, hypoxia at OSH. Pt arrived
intubated, sedated, majority of history is obtained by notes
from OSH. Pt initially presented [**11-22**] c/o increasing SOB, CXR
revealed bilateral pulmonary infilrates. Unclear if CHF given
elevated BNP and cardiomegaly vs. exacerbation of lung disease.
Pt treated with nebs, high-dose steroids, abx, and Bi-pap with
some improvement. Workup for lung disease included BAL,
legionella, acetone, [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], all of which were negative. TTE
on [**11-25**] revealed EF 35-40% with WMA, symmetric LVH. A Swan-Ganz
cath was placed which revealed PA systolic pressures 50-60,
wedge of [**1-15**]. The patient then had worsening of the BL
infiltrates and an episode of hemoptysis and was subsequently
intubated.
.
Per her medical chart, she did not have any preceding symptoms
of fever, cough, weight loss or chest pain to accompany the
shortness of breath. She did note increasing skin pruritis over
past few months. Speaking with her sister, it was reported the
pt had experienced a chronic cough and recent weight loss,
thought to be secondary to thyroid disease.

nature.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo female with prior history of asthma, CAD, uncertain
diagnosis IPF, CHF who was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Hospital 1562**]
Hospital for further evaluation and treatment of respiratory
failure, valvular disease, and ARF.

The respiratory failure was secondary to hypoxemia, cardiac vs.
pulmonary etiology. The patient carried a diagnosis of IPF
(based on radiologic findings) and asthma and had been on oxygen
at home for the past three weeks. The initial differential dx
included infection (bacterial vs. atypical vs. viral vs. PCP),
inflammatory (Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**], Wegener's), autoimmune, or shunt; a
PE was thought to be less likely given PA measurements.  She was
continued on high dose steroids and given broad antibiotic
coverage to include MRSA, atypicals, anaerobes.  She underwent
bronchoscopy which was consistent with alveolar hemorrhage,
although it was unclear whether this was just related to heart
failure.  Cultures from the BAL were negative.  She also
underwent a repeat chest CT which showed micronodular pulmonary
abnormalities, no evidence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,
enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, and extensive coronary artery
and aorta atherosclerotic calcifications.  She was ruled out for
influenza and legionella.  [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA, Anti-GBM ab were all
negative.

In terms of her cardiac disease, the pt had a history of CHF w/
severe MR.  She underwent repeat [**Doctor First Name 113**] which showed mild global
biventricular systolic dysfunction with severe mitral, aortic,
and tricuspid regurgitation.  Cardiology was consulted and it
was felt that she would not be a candidate for valve
replacement.  She was medically managed with afterload reduction
and diuresis.

In terms of her renal failure, the patient's creatinine doubled
by 50% since admission to the OSH from 1.2-->1.8. The
differential included pre-renal from over diuresis vs. AIN from
antibiotics, vs. Wegener's.  Urine lytes were sent along with
UA, urine sediment, and urine eosinophils, which were negative.


Following extubation, the patient developed tachycardia with a
rhythm most likely aflutter with varying block with demand
ventricular pacing, and diltiazem was utilized for rate control.
 The following day, she was quite stable on minimal supplemental
oxygen for several hours.  However, around noon she developed a
sense of dread and quickly became tachycardic and hypoxic with
an oxygen saturation in the 60's, requiring reintubation.  The
patient's a-line failed, she became hypotensive, and pressors
(Levophed and Dobutamine) were initiated.  She was intubated,
and became pulseless. Full resuscitation was attempted with CPR,
electrical defibrillation, and medications but the efforts were
stop when she became unresponsively asystolic.  The patient
expired on [**11-29**].  Her HCP and next of [**Doctor First Name **] were notified and
requested an autopsy.
