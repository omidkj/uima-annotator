Please note this is an addendum to two previous dictations on
this patient for the same hospital course.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is
a 76-year-old male with past medical history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease who presented to the [**Last Name (un) **]
Intensive Care Unit on [**2182-8-14**] with rapid atrial fibrillation
and congestive heart failure.  His hospital course has been
complicated by development of Enterobacter ventilator
associated pneumonia as well as a history of right cerebral
water stride strokes resulting in left sided hemiparesis as
well as diminished cough and gag reflex.  The patient was
extubated during his admission to the [**Doctor Last Name **] Intensive Care
Unit and transferred to the General Medicine Floor on the
[**Hospital Ward Name **] of [**Hospital1 69**].
However, on the floor he decompensated secondary to fever and
respiratory failure and was admitted to the MICU service on
the [**Hospital Ward Name **] with respiratory failure and enterococcal
sepsis of unknown etiology.

Again, this dictation is an addendum to two previous
dictations on the same patient for this hospital admission.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEMS ADDENDUM
1.  Respiratory failure. As noted previously the patient has
underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with
baseline O2 sats of 90% and is known to be a CO2 retainer.
He underwent extubation on [**2182-9-13**].  However, he required
reintubation on [**2182-9-14**] after failing secondary to inability
to handle secretions.  Status post his cerebrovascular
accident he has minimal cough and gag reflex.  Therefore he
is unable to clear respiratory secretions.  At this time the
family, namely his daughters were approached regarding
tracheostomy placement.  It was felt that this would be in
the patient's best medical interest to avoid prolonged
intubation and the risks there entailed.  However, family
would not consent to tracheostomy at that time.  The patient
remained intubated from [**2182-9-14**] to [**2182-9-21**]. On [**2182-9-21**] he
self-extubated.  Initially he did well.  However, he began to
have difficulty with increased work of breathing and
inability to clear his oropharyngeal and respiratory
secretions.  He underwent bronchoscopy on [**2182-9-23**] to
evaluate for mucous plugging.  Bronchoscopy showed moderate
thick secretions above and below the vocal cords and a small
amount of secretions in the left lower lobe.  These were
suctioned.  Moderate airway erythema was noted at that time
however, there are no major abnormalities of the airways.
Despite bronchoscopy and secretion management, the patient
had to undergo re-intubation on [**2182-9-27**] again secondary to
increased work of breathing and inability to handle oral and
respiratory secretions.  He then self-extubated again on
[**2182-10-2**].  Again, he did well for several days demonstrating
adequate oxygenation and ventilation.  However, once again he
failed to be able to handle his secretions and was
reintubated on [**2182-10-5**].  Ultimately the patient's guardian,
daughter [**Name (NI) 16883**] [**Name (NI) 4135**], consented for tracheostomy placement.
The patient underwent tracheostomy placement at bedside on
[**2182-10-2**].  He tolerated this procedure well without any major
complications.

Throughout his hospital course, he was continued on an
aggressive pulmonary regimen of chest physical therapy,
Metered dose inhalers, and aggressive pulmonary toilet
including q one to two hour suctioning.  The patient had been
started on high dosed steroids earlier in his hospital
course.  Steroid dose was tapered to the lowest dose
necessary in light of his history of adrenal insufficiency.

2.  Sepsis.  The patient was treated for his first course of
enterococcal sepsis with a total of five days of Gentamicin
and two weeks of Ampicillin therapy.  A transthoracic was
performed and was negative for any vegetations or
endocarditis.  At that time the patient would not consent for
transesophageal echo.  As the transthoracic echo was negative
a two week course of Ampicillin was approved by the
Infectious Disease Service.  The patient's blood cultures
were negative with several surveillance cultures.  However,
on [**2182-9-28**] the patient spiked a temperature and was
recultured.  At that time 3/4 bottles grew enterococcus,
Ampicillin sensitive, high level Gentamicin resistant.  At
that time the patient's pre-existing central venous line was
pulled.  Catheter tip was cultured and was negative.  The
patient was restarted on Ampicillin at 2 grams intravenous q
4 hours.  Multiple sepsis surveillance cultures were sent and
were consistently negative.  In light of the patient's
failure of previous Ampicillin therapy via the two week
course, decision was made to treat the patient with a total
of six weeks of therapy.  In order to facilitate long-term
antibiotic therapy, a PICC line was placed on [**2182-10-7**] by
Interventional Radiology.

3.  Atrial fibrillation.  The patient's atrial fibrillation
was well rate controlled with Diltiazem and Lopressor.  He
initially also was on Amiodarone.  However, Amiodarone was
discontinued as the patient had failed cardioversion times
one and was felt likely to fail cardioversion again due to
his history of prolonged atrial fibrillation as well as
evidence of dilated left atrium on echocardiogram.
4.  Congestive heart failure.  The patient had transthoracic
echo which demonstrated a normal ejection fraction, a normal
systolic function.  It was felt that he likely had diastolic
dysfunction.  He had several episodes of flash pulmonary
edema  all in the setting of tachycardia.  With each of these
episodes he was diuresed gently with Lasix which read to
resolution of pulmonary edema.  He does not warrant a
standing daily dose of Lasix.

5.  Status post cerebrovascular accident.  The patient had a
history of right cerebrovascular accident during this
hospitalization resulting in decreased gag reflex, depressed
cough and left sided weakness.  He was continued on aspirin
and Lipitor therapy for secondary stroke prevention.  He also
had witnessed evidence of focal, motor seizures of the right
upper extremity.  He was evaluated by the Neurology service
for these events.  He was started on Dilantin for seizure
prophylaxis.  His Dilantin level was monitored via free
Dilantin levels and is therapeutic at the current dose of 50
mg q 12 hours.  To facilitate rehabilitation from his acute
stroke the patient should likely undergo speech and swallow
evaluation as well as speech therapy and physical therapy at
his extended care rehabilitation facility as well as an
outpatient status post discharge from such facility.
Ultimately, he needs to follow-up with Neurology after
discharge.  A phone number will be provided to the Neurology
office so the patient can make an appointment. The patient
had a fluctuating hematocrit during this hospitalization,
originally admitted with hematocrit of 34 but thereafter
ranging in the values of 28 to 30.  He did have a CT scan of
the abdomen which showed no evidence of retroperitoneal
bleed. However, he did have several guaiac positive stools
however, no frank melena was noted.  In light of this his
Heparin was held.  Heparin was used primarily for
anti-coagulation in light of his history of atrial
fibrillation.  Several times during this hospitalization he
was transfused for a hematocrit less than 26.  On these
occasions we attempted to obtain consent from family members
but often said family members were [**Name2 (NI) 16535**] or refused
consent.  However, it was felt a medical necessity to keep
the patient's hematocrit and blood volume stable.  All told
he received a total of six units packed red cells during this
admission.

7.  Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition.  The patient is
undergoing tube feeds which are at goal.  He underwent
percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement at bedside on
[**2182-10-7**].  He tolerated the procedure well.  He will continue
to have tube feeds via his per
