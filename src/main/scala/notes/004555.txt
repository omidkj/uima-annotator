CXR [**2124-11-23**]: Bilateral pleural effusions, right much greater
than left. The large right effusion has enlarged in the interval
since prior exam.

ECG [**2124-11-23**]: Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular
response. Possible old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
Compared to the previous tracing there has been slowing of the
ventricular response rate.

Left lower extremity ultrasound [**2124-11-23**]: No DVT


Brief Hospital Course:
1. CHF, acute on chronic diastolic with hypoxemia and
respiratory failure
2. Pleural effusions
3. Acute renal failure with CKD, stage 3
4. Hypothyroidism
5. Atrial fibrillation
6. Acute blood loss anemia
7. Constipation

Found to have significant bilateral pleural effusions. She was
diuresed with IV furosemide, but this was somewhat limited by
blood pressure and kidney function.  On [**11-27**], she developed
hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring transfer to
the ICU. She was diuresed further there, with improvement. She
did not require intubation. She was transferred back to the
general medical [**Hospital1 **] on [**11-29**]. She underwent bedside right-sided
thoracentesis with pigtail placement on [**11-30**], followed by
left-sided thoracentesis with pigtail placement on [**12-2**]. Drains
was left in place until [**2124-12-5**]. Analysis of pleural effusion
revealed transudate.

The left-sided procedures once complicated by minor bleeding
which resolved with pressure dressings and administration of
ddAVP.

Her acute renal failure was likely related to diuresis. This
improved over the stay.
