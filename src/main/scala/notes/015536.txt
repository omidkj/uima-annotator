Admission Date:  [**2156-12-13**]       Discharge Date:  [**2157-1-11**]

Date of Birth:   [**2088-1-7**]       Sex:  F

Service: NEUROLOGY
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old
female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency and
coronary artery disease, who was admitted with a left sided
putamenal bleed.  She initially presented on [**2156-12-14**] with
interactive on presentation, however, required urgent
intubation with emesis and aspiration in the Emergency
Department on the day of admission.  Chest x-ray at the time
of admission showed a possible left lower lobe infiltrate and
a hazy right middle lobe infiltrate.

The patient was initially on the Neuro/ICU Service and
course while under the care of Neurologic Intensive Care Unit
Team included stroke care as above.  The patient had a left
sided putamenal bleed.  She was treated conservatively and
had partial return of her right sided function but waxing and
[**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status presented a good valuation of her right
sided function.  Acute renal failure that was nonoliguric ATN
thought to be secondary to renal hyperperfusion associated
with a decreased blood pressure.  Failure to wean from the
ventilator.  The patient had an attempted extubation on
[**2156-12-16**] but failed with respiratory distress and hypoxia.
The patient self extubated on [**2156-12-21**] while on pressure
supports and again was hypoxic, tachypneic and hypertensive.
The patient had evidence of congestive heart failure with
mild pulmonary edema.  The patient had an E coli urinary
tract infection that was treated with Levaquin starting on
[**2156-12-17**].

The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit Service secondary to failure to wean from vent.
Barriers to extubation at the time of admission were thought
to be copious secretions from her sputum, congestive heart
failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and ongoing
agitation and waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is
significant for a left putamenal bleed as documented in the

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS, history of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, history of hypertension, history of
diabetes mellitus, history of chronic renal insufficiency
with a baseline creatinine of around 2.5, history of
hypercholesterolemia, history of diet induced ATN in the
past, history of coronary artery disease, status post
myocardial infarction in 09/[**2154**].

She had a HOSPITAL COURSE at that time complicated by
cardiogenic shock requiring prolonged intubation and
pulmonary hemorrhage.  Hospitalization was a [**Hospital6 8866**].  The patient has a history of congestive
heart failure.

of admission were noted to be:
1.  Insulin.

15. Ativan prn.
16. Dilaudid .5 intravenous q 4 prn.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Social history is notable for patient with a
significant tobacco history, one to two packs per day for 45
years.  No history of alcohol use or abuse and no history of
intravenous drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's family history is significant
for stroke in a sister and a grandmother as well as history
of colon cancer in a sister and a grandmother.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  On transfer to the MICU, the patient had a
temperature of 99.3; pulse, 88; blood pressure, 159/69;
respiratory rate, 20.  She was on pressure support of PEEP of
10 and FIO2 of 60 percent.  Oxygen saturation, 100%.  The
patient's central venous pressure was 16.  The patient's in's
and out's for the 18 hours prior to admission were 940 in,
880 cc of urine out.  Generally, the patient was intubated
and sedated, however, responsive to verbal commands.  Pupils
were equal, round and reactive.  She had a right IJ that was
in place.  Cardiovascular exam was notable for regular rate
and no murmurs.  Lungs had coarse breath sounds bilaterally
but were clear anterior and laterally.  Belly was obese but
soft, non-tender.  Hypoactive bowel sounds.  The patient had
no lower extremity edema but left hand with 2+ edema.
Neurologically, the patient would open her eyes to command,
could grasp with her right hand, could move her right arm
with intention.  Left arm and left lower extremity moved
spontaneously.  Right foot moved intermittently.

LABORATORY ON ADMISSION:  White count, 9.4; crit, 33;
platelets, 259.  INR, 1.0; PTT, 25.  Sodium, 144; K, 4;
chloride, 109; bicarbonate, 25; BUN, 55; creatinine, 3.0

Chest x-ray prior to admission showed bilateral pleural
effusions with mild pulmonary edema.

The patient had had a sputum culture from [**2156-12-17**] which
showed rare growth of oropharyngeal flora.  Blood culture
from [**2156-12-17**] showed no growth and a urine culture from
[**2156-12-17**] which was E coli that was pan sensitive being
treated with Levaquin on transfer.

In short, this is a 68 year old female with a history of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery
disease, congestive heart failure, who initially presented
with left putamenal stroke and has subsequently had a failure
to wean from the vent likely secondary to chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure and copious
secretions.

ISSUE #1:  PULMONARY - The patient had multiple barriers to
weaning including coronary artery disease and congestive
heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
decreased mental status and copious secretions and pneumonia.
The patient was diuresed as tolerated with diuresis
occasionally being limited by her poor renal function.

ISSUE #2:  INFECTIOUS DISEASE - The patient continued to
spike fevers and was started on Vanco and Ceftabs for
ventilator acquired pneumonia.  The patient completed a 14
day course of antibiotics for ventilator acquired pneumonia
but still continued to have copious secretions on the day of
discharge.  The patient was treated with inhaled steroids and
Atrovent to palliate her chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.

The patient's mental status, unfortunately, remained
problem[**Name (NI) 115**] throughout the course of her hospitalization.
The patient self extubated twice more, always requiring
immediate reintubation.  Given the patient's perpensity to
self extubate and fail her own self initiated trials of
ventilator liberation, the patient underwent tracheostomy
prior to discharge and will require ongoing pulmonary
rehabilitation to wean from vent.

ISSUE #3:  INFECTIOUS DISEASE - The patient initially was
treated for her urinary tract infection with Levaquin,
however, she was spiking fevers to as high as 102 while on
Levaquin.  The patient's blood cultures eventually grew
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  The patient's
sputum cultures were significant for growing 4+ Gram negative
rods as well as Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
The patient was treated for 10 days with Vanco and Ceptaz for
ventilator acquired pneumonia and completed an additional
four days of antibiotics for treatment of her Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia with Vancomycin.
The patient had no further positive blood cultures after
initiation of treatment with Vancomycin.  The patient had a
sputum culture two days prior to discharge that was notable
only for oropharyngeal flora as well as Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus.  It should be noted that there were
greater than epi's
