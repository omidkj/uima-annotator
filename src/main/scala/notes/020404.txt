Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3276**]
Chief Complaint:
back and neck pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

Cytoscopy with clot evacuation - [**2172-2-20**]

History of Present Illness:
77 year old woman with history of hypertension, hypothyroidism,
significant vascular disease requiring multiple vascular
surgeries including aorto-R carotid bypass for subclavian steal
syndrome, and remote aortobifemoral bypass, seizure disorder,
and subacute onset of atraumatic chest, back and neck pain, who
was referred to ED from PCP's office today for worsening upper
and lower back pain. Her pain is primarily over her upper back
and neck, as well as some bilateral anterior chest pain, all of
which are worsened with movement.
.
These symptoms have been accompanied by worsening fatigue,
anorexia and decreased functional status over the past several
weeks. She typically is active, plays tennis and is totally
independent in her ADLs. She currently has great difficulty with
walking up stairs, lifting laundry, and exerting herself in
other ways. She has lost 15 lbs over the past 1-2 months. She
denies fevers, chills, or drenching sweats. Denies tingling,
numbness, paresthesias, bowel incontinence, or urinary
retention. Her PCP has recently considered the diagnosis of PMR
as an explanation for her symptoms; the patient's pain did not
respond to steroid therapy, and she completed a taper to off,
this morning.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 97.6. 151/77. 78. 18. 97% RA. Neuro exam
was nonfocal, and pt had no focal or midline spinal tenderness.
Labs notable for leukocytosis with left shift, anemia (hct 34)
and hyponatremia (129). U/a demonstrated pyuria, bacteriuria,
and hematuria. CTA of torso revealed obstructing bladder mass
with hydronephrosis and hydroureter, lytic T6 lesions extending
posteriorly into spinal canal, L3 compression fracture, and
other mottled appearing cervical vertebrae concerning for
metastatic disease. Pt was given normal saline, 5 mg diazepam
PO, morphine 4 mg IV x2, and ceftriaxone 1g. Spine was consulted
and recommended MRI for further characterization of vertebral
lesions and spinal cord pathology. MRI was ordered but pt was
transferred to floor prior to MRI, given delay. VS prior to
transfer were 89 174/80 18 97%RA.
.
Currently, she is accompanied by her daughter; both women are
quiet and intermittently tearful, expressing concern about pt's
life expectancy. She continues to have significant back and neck
pain with movement, but feels more comfortable when she is
still. Denies any paresthesias or numbness. Denies urinary
symptoms, although may be having the urge to urinate more
frequently than usual. She can pass urine easily when she needs
to.

IMAGING STUDIES:
[**2172-2-12**] MR CERVICAL, THORACIC, LUMBAR SPINE W/O C - Extensive
bone marrow changes of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine
as detailed above, representing osseous metastatic disease.
Compression fractures are identified at T3 and T6, the latter
with mild retropulsion and indentation on the spinal cord.
Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine with
spinal canal stenosis.
.
[**2172-2-12**] LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US - Distended gallbladder without
stones or other sign of acute cholecystitis. Mild intrahepatic
biliary duct dilatation. Severe right hydronephrosis, fully
discussed on the recent CTA torso from [**2172-2-11**], likely
secondary to bladder cancer. Trace perihepatic ascites.
.
[**2172-2-16**] MR PELVIS W&W/O CONTRAS - Urinary catheter is noted
within the bladder with thrombus identified in relation to the
right ureteric orifice. Abnormal region enhancing mass noted in
the right distal ureter causing proximal right hydronephrosis
and hydroureter concerning for either a transitional carcinoma
of the right distal ureter versus a bladder mass invading the
right ureteric orifice. Diffuse osseous metastatic disease noted
of the axial pelvic skeleton.
.
[**2172-2-18**] CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRA - No evidence of metastatic
lesions to the brain or bones. MRI would be more accurate in
identifying metastatic lesions if not contraindicated.
.
[**2172-2-20**] CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CON - Right hydroureter and
hydronephrosis, with hyperdense material distending the right
renal pelvis, ureter and the bladder, compatible with
hemorrhage. The biopsied periureteral mass likely responsible
for the hemorrhage is not appreciated by non contrast CT. New
low-density ascites, with small hyperdense component in the
cul-de-sac. Given the clnical history, this likely reflects
bladder rupture, with the low-density fluid representing urine.
The small hyperdense component in the cul-de-sac is attributable
to the blood products seen within the bladder. Left greater than
right pleural effusions, with associated atelectasis.
.
[**2172-2-21**] 2D-ECHO - The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right
atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. There is mo
