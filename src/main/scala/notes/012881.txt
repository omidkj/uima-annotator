Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 62-year-old woman with
a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, with a
history of postprandial epigastric pain.

In the recent past she had a markedly positive exercise
tolerance test which prompted cardiac catheterization
revealing severe left main coronary artery disease.  The
patient denies any history of orthopnea or paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea.  The patient does have occasional lower
extremity edema which was thought to be secondary to her use
of calcium channel blockers.  She denies any history or
symptoms of cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic
attack or atrial fibrillation.  She denies claudication.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes.
2.  High cholesterol.
3.  Hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She is status post total abdominal
hysterectomy/bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  General appearance
revealed well-appearing, in no distress, comfortable.  HEENT
revealed extraocular muscles were intact.  Pupils were equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  No carotid
bruits.  Pulmonary was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.  Abdomen
was obese, soft and nontender.  Extremities were warm.  No
edema.  Palpable pulses in all extremities.  No varicosities.
The patient had an intra-aortic balloon pump in place which
was placed in the catheterization laboratory on the day of
admission.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:   Coronary angiography findings revealed a
right-dominant system with significant obstructive left main
coronary artery disease.  There was a focal 90% ostial
stenosis.  The left anterior descending artery and circumflex
were without significant stenosis.  Right coronary artery had
a tubular 50% proximal stenosis followed by a middle 30%
stenosis.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left-sided
filling pressures.  The left ventricular end-diastolic
pressure was 15 mmHg, consistent with mild diastolic
dysfunction.  There was no significant pressure gradient
across the aortic valve.  Left ventriculography revealed
hypokinesis of the inferior and posterobasal walls.  No
significant mitral regurgitation was noted.  Calculated left
ventricular ejection fraction was 49%.  Intra-aortic balloon
pump was placed as a result of significant obstructive left
main coronary artery disease.  Placement of this pump
revealed appropriate diastolic augmentation of blood
pressure.

Exercise tolerance test:  Impression was a very limited
exercise tolerance; test terminated secondary to hypotensive
blood pressure response in the presence of a marked diffuse
ST segment changes which persisted until later recovery.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Chemistry revealed sodium
of 141, potassium 3.6, chloride 106, bicarbonate 30, BUN 10,
creatinine 0.8, glucose 129.  Complete blood count with a
white blood cell count of 5.1, hematocrit 40.8,
platelets 283.  Coagulations were PT 12.7, PTT 30.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted on the same day
of her cardiac catheterization and was brought to the
operating room on a semi-emergent basis.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**]
performed coronary artery bypass graft on three vessels.  He
anastomosed the left internal mammary artery to the left
anterior descending artery.  A saphenous vein graft was used
as a conduit for bypass to both the obtuse marginal and the
right coronary artery.  Please see previously dictated
Operative Note for more details.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred
to the Intensive Care Unit on a Neo-Synephrine and propofol
drip.

The patient had a relatively uncomplicated postoperative
course.  She was reversed and extubated on postoperative day
one.  Her intra-aortic balloon pump was also discontinued on
postoperative day one.  Once she was extubated she began to
tolerate a regular diet in the Intensive Care Unit.

On postoperative day two, she was transferred from the
Intensive Care Unit to the patient care floor.  Her chest
tube was removed in the Intensive Care Unit prior to transfer
to the floor.  Her cardiac pacing wires were removed on
postoperative day three as was her Foley catheter.

On postoperative day three, the patient was noted to have a
blood sugar of 405.  Because of this, her morning dose of
Lente was changed from 30 units to 35 units, and she was put
on a more aggressive insulin sliding-scale.  Also, the [**Hospital **]
Clinic was consulted.  Follow-up blood sugars were in a
controlled range, and she had reasonable blood sugar control
after this event.

On postoperative day five, the patient was ambulating at
level V and tolerating diet.  Pain was controlled.  Blood
sugars were controlled, and was urinating on her own and was
agreeable with going home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS: The patient was to be discharged home.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. times one week.
3.  Potassium chloride supplements 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. while
on Lasix.
4.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n.
5.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. while on Percocet.
6.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Ibuprofen 600 mg p.o. q.6h. with food p.r.n. for pain.
8.  NPH insulin; the patient had her insulin regimen altered
by the [**Hospital **] Clinic.  Their recommendations were to increase
her a.m. dose of NPH from 30 units to 35 units.  Her evening
dose will remain at 20 units.  In addition, she will be on a
pre-breakfast and pre-dinner sliding-scale of regular
insulin.  For blood sugar of 100 to 150 she was to take
2 units of regular insulin, 151 to 200 she was to take
3 units, 201 to 250 she was to take 4 units, 251 to 300 she
was to take 5 units, 301 to 350 she was to take 6 units, 351
to 400 she was to take 7 units.  This was discussed with the
patient and [**Last Name (un) **] also provided teaching.  It was confirmed
that the patient understood her current regimen of insulin
that she will be discharged home on.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:   Status post coronary artery bypass
graft times three.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   The patient was to see her primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 35916**], in three weeks.  The patient was to
see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] back in clinic in six weeks.
