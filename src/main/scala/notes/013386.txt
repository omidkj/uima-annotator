HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64-year-old gentleman
with a history of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease who was found to have esophageal cancer on endoscopy
and biopsy.  He underwent chemotherapy and radiation with
evidence of shrinkage on CT scan.  He now presents for
preoperative preparation for his distal esophagectomy and
total gastrectomy.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Esophageal cancer status post
chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  2. [**Doctor Last Name 15532**] esophagus.
3. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring home O2 at
three liters.  4. Peptic ulcer disease.  5. Coronary artery
disease status post myocardial infarction eight years ago.
6. Ventral hernia not repaired.

MEDICATIONS:  1. Atrovent 2 puffs q.i.d.  2. Flovent 2 puffs
b.i.d.  3. Lasix 20 p.o. q.d.  4. Diltiazem 240 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Theophylline 300 mg p.o. b.i.d.  6. Isosorbide dinitrate
20 mg p.o. b.i.d.  7. Xanax 0.5 mg p.o. q.d. p.r.n.  8.
Protonix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a significant smoker who
requires home oxygen and does have a history of alcohol in
the past but quit 20 years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He was afebrile at 99.9, heart rate
110, blood pressure stable at 120/60, respiratory rate 24,
and he was 92% on three liters of oxygen.  He was in no
apparent distress.  He had moist mucous membranes.  Pupils
were equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements were intact.  His lungs were clear with mild
wheezes and crackles at the bases.  His heart was tachycardic
but with no murmurs.  His abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended.  He was mildly obese and had a well-healed
ventral hernia scar.  His extremities were warm and well
perfused.  There was no clubbing noted.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission his arterial blood gas showed
a pH of 7.45, PCO2 52, PO2 60, bicarbonate 37 and a base
excess of 9.  His white count was 6.3, hematocrit 39.1,
platelet count 165.  His chemistries showed a sodium of 145,
potassium 2.8, chloride 99, bicarbonate 35, BUN 15,
creatinine 1.0, blood sugar 157.  His AST was 27, ALT 23,
alkaline phosphatase 148, total bilirubin 0.6, albumin 4.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to the hospital and given a
bowel preparation with neomycin and erythromycin and made
n.p.o. for the planned operation.

On [**2120-4-16**] the patient was taken to the operating room where
a distal esophagectomy and total gastrectomy was performed as
well as a jejunostomy tube placement.  The patient was
transferred to the surgical intensive care unit
postoperatively.  Please see the operative report for
details.

The patient did well in the surgical intensive care unit.
His PCO2 was maintained below 60 with his PO2 maintained
above 60 as well.  The patient was put on patient-controlled
analgesia for pain control on postoperative day one after his
epidural had fallen out.  He had good pain control at that
time.  The patient was able to be extubated immediately
postoperatively and did well.  His laboratory values were all
within normal limits.  He had good urine output at that time.
He was started on postoperative day one on tube feeds,
Impact with fiber at half-strength, 20 cc an hour.  The
patient was doing well on his tube feeds and the Dilaudid PCA
on postoperative day number two.  His tube feeds were slowly
increased to 30 cc an hour.  He was also started back on his
diltiazem.  His PCO2 at that time was 60.
Physical therapy was consulted to evaluate for ambulation and
the patient was found to be doing well from this standpoint.
It was felt that after adequate pain control was obtained the
patient would be able to be successfully able to ambulate
throughout his hospital course and could ultimately go home
when medically stable.

Nutrition was also consulted at that time on [**2120-4-18**] for
evaluation of nutritional needs.  It was felt that the
patient would require 90 cc of full-strength Impact with
fiber in order to meet his nutritional needs.  His tube feeds
on postoperative day number three were increased again to 50
cc an hour.  He continued to improve.  His blood gas at that
time also revealed that his PCO2 was in the 50s and his PO2
was in the 50s as well.  The patient was maintained on nasal
cannula oxygen throughout his hospital course after
extubation.  Aggressive chest physical therapy and pulmonary
toilet were instituted and the patient maintained a good O2
saturation on three liters of oxygen.

The patient was transferred to the floor on [**2120-4-22**].  His
tube feeds were slowly advanced to goal at half strength at
90 cc an hour and the patient was tolerating the tube feeds
well.  His blood gases continued to have PCO2 in the 50s and
PO2 in the 50s.  The patient was out of bed and ambulating
and doing well at that time.  It was decided that the patient
could be increased to two-thirds strength tube feeds after
arriving on the floor due to the fact that the patient was
tolerating his tube feeds.

Physical therapy continued to evaluate him at that time as
well and felt that he was doing well and progressing.  The
patient was started on sips on postoperative day six which he
was able to tolerate after an upper GI/small bowel
follow-through was performed.  This showed an open
anastomosis with no leak, therefore his nasogastric tube was
removed using mineral oil to lubricate.

On postoperative day number eight his tube feeds were
switched to two-thirds strength and the patient tolerated the
switch well.  He was also started on a clear liquid diet
which he was able to tolerate.

On postoperative day eight in the evening he was stared on a
soft solid diet and he continued to improve.  On
postoperative day number nine his tube feeds were cycled so
that they would run from 7 PM to 7 AM, giving him two-thirds
strength Impact with fiber at 90 cc an hour and he could be
disconnected from his jejunostomy tube feeds during the day,
allowing him to ambulate.  The patient continued to do well
and continued receiving chest physical therapy, and was out
of bed and ambulating.  JP teaching was performed and on
postoperative day number 10 the patient was tolerating a soft
solid diet, having six small meals a day.  Nutrition had seen
him and had given him nutritional teaching about a soft solid
diet and multiple small meals, and it was decided that the
patient could be discharged home.

The patient was discharged home in stable condition with
services in place, for planned jejunostomy tube feeds at 90
cc an hour of two-thirds strength Impact with fiber.  The
patient was also planned to have VNA services for
[**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain monitoring and wound check.  The patient
was discharged home at that time in stable condition.

to 7 AM.
10. Vicodin for pain control.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Esophageal cancer status post XRT and chemotherapy now
status post distal esophagectomy and total gastrectomy with

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] in one week's time for wound check, [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**]
drain removal as well as review of pathology.  Pathology
reports were not back at the time of discharge.
