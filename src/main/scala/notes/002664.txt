Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
seizures

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**4-5**] intubation

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 69 year-old man with PMHx of afib (not on
anticoagulation) s/p pacemaker, HTN, COPD, CAD s/p cardiac
bypass
in [**2104-1-19**], DM2 and adrenal insufficiency (on chronic steroids)
who presents from an OSH after 5 reported seizures.  Per pt's
wife, the pt had been c/o "not feeling well" for 3 days, but did
not have any specific sx like runny nose, cough, sore throat
etc.
and did not have any fevers/chills.  Then on [**4-5**], pt's wife
reports that he pt was on the phone with their granddaughter,
and
she thought he had hung up the phone (she was in the next room),
but then the phone rang again and he didn't pick it up, so she
went to check on him and found him on the bed with his arms and
legs shaking and her eyes rolled back. This lasted about a
minute
and so his wife called 911.  [**Name2 (NI) **] then had 2 more before EMS
showed
up.  EMS noted that he had urinated on himself.  He was taken to
[**Hospital3 **], but in the ambulance and while in the ED he was
given
6mg of ativan, intubated, sedated (on propofol) and given
fosphenytoin 1200mg x1.  He then began bucking the vent so was
given 2mg of additional ativan.  As the pt is on chronic
steroids, there was concern for an infectious source of the
seizures, so at the OSH he was given vancomycin and zosyn, as
well as hydrocortisone 100mg IV x1.
He was then sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  In the ED, he
was minimally responsive, not following commands. He had an LP
which showed 0 WBCs and 8 RBCs, with protein of 35 and glucose
of
165.  He was noted to be afebrile.  He was admitted to the neuro
ICU for further monitoring.
.
Pt is unable to complete the Neuro or General ROS as he is
intubated and sedated.

NCHCT [**2105-4-6**]: No acute intracranial process. If there is
ongoing concern of the cause of seizures, then an MR may be far
more helpful than this non contrast CT.

LENIs [**2105-4-6**]: No deep venous thrombosis in right or left
lower extremity.

KUB [**2105-4-7**]: An image of the abdomen centered at the
umbilicus shows a
nasogastric tube coiled in the stomach and may end just below
the
gastroesophageal junction. There is no particular distention of
intestinal
tract in the upper abdomen.

NCHCT [**2105-4-6**]: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema,
mass, mass effect, or infarction. The ventricles and sulci are
normal in size and configuration. The basal cisterns appear
patent and there is preservation of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation.
No fracture is identified. Bilateral sclerosis of mastoid air
cells, right greater than left, suggest chronic inflammation.
Bilateral retention cysts are noted in the maxillary sinuses.
The visualized ethmoid and frontal sinuses are clear.

Chest Film [**2105-4-7**]: As compared to the previous radiograph,
the patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube was
removed. Lung volumes have slightly decreased. The signs
suggesting fluid overload have slightly increased. The size of
the cardiac silhouette is still above the normal range. No
larger pleural effusions. No focal parenchymal opacity
suggesting pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
69M w/ AF (not on AC) s/p PPM, HTN, COPD, CAD (s/p CABG), DM2,
adrenal insufficiency presented s/p five seizures. Intubated for
airway protection/respiratory support initially in ICU. The
patient initially was admitted for control of a cluster of
seizures which did not recur. He was treated with Fosphenytoin
which his liver appeared to metabolize quickly, resulting in
initial subtherapeutic levels. Fosphenytoin was subsequently
bolused and titrated up. He had a 20 min EEG performed to
exclude the possbility of status epilepticus which showed
encephalopathy but no epileptiform discharges or electrographic
seizures. When he was tapered from Propofol and extubated, his
mental status returned to his normal baseline.

In terms of the possible etiologies, he could then report that
he had no prior history of seizures. There were no toxic
metabolic abnormalities on his laboratory studies including on
measures of electrolytes, given his history of adrenal
insufficiency. He does, however, drink ETOH daily (at least five
beers) which although reporting consistent drinking during the
prior three days when he felt ill he also had an ETOH level of 0
upon arrival to our ED. He was treated with an MVI, thiamine,
and folate. He will be maintained on Dilantin mono-therapy (PO)
for 4 weeks after discharge before discontinuation.

In the days prior to his discharge, he remained at times
noncooperative with RN staff and PT staff on the floor. He
refused PT evaluations. At times, he would become tearful, and
at other times, he would make open advances t
