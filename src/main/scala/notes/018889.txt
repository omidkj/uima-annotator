CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate pleural effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
49 year old woman s/p TV repair/VSD closure
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate pleural effusions
INDICATION: 49-year-old female status post tricuspid valve
repair and ventricular septal device closure. Evaluate pleural
effusions.

COMPARISON: AP semi-upright portable chest x-ray dated [**2112-2-3**].

AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY: The patient is status post
median sternotomy and tricuspid valve repair. The cardiac
silhouette is stablely enlarged. Pulmonary vasculature is not
engorged and there is no pneumothorax. Linear atelectasis
aligning the right minor fissure is decreased. A small right
pleural effusion is slightly decreased from one day earlier, and
there is a persistent tiny left pleural effusion. Diffuse
bullous changes are again noted bilaterally.

IMPRESSION: Decreased small right, and tiny left pleural
effusions.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Markedly dilated RA. A catheter
or pacing
wire is seen in the RA. Dynamic interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D
or color
Doppler. The IVC is normal in diameter with <50% decrease during
respiration
(estimated RAP 11-15mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Mild global LV
hypokinesis. Mildly
depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity. Moderate global
RV free wall
hypokinesis. Abnormal diastolic septal motion/position
consistent with RV
volume overload.

AORTA: Normal ascending, transverse and descending thoracic
aorta with no
atherosclerotic plaque. Normal ascending aorta diameter. No
atheroma in
ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. No atheroma in
aortic arch.
Normal descending aorta diameter. No atheroma in descending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR. No
AS. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Normal
mitral valve
supporting structures. No MS. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderately thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Tricuspid
leaflets do not fully coapt. Moderate to severe [3+] TR.
Eccentric TR jet.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR. Normal pulmonic valve leaflets. No PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results
were personally
post-bypass
data

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:

1.The right atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D
or color Doppler.

2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is mild
global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly
depressed.

3.The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is
moderate global
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
diastolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
overload.

4.. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in
diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque.

5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic valve
stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.

6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.

7.The tricuspid valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The
tricuspid valve
leaflets fail to fully coapt. There is tethering of the septal
leaflet and
prolapse of the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve.
Moderate to severe
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
regurgitation jet is
eccentric and may be underestimated.

8.There is no pericardial effusion.

9. There is an inlet Ventricular septal defect 0.7 cm in size
just underneath
the attachment of the septal leaflet to the interventricular
septum. There is
left to right flow across the interventricular septal defect.

POST-BYPASS: Pt is in sinus rhythm and is on an infusion of
milrinone,
epinephrine and phenylephrine

1. An annuloplasty ring is well seated in the tricuspid
position. Trace TR is
seen. A mean gradient of around 3-4 mm of Hg is seen across the
valve.

2. RV function is slighly improved. LV function also appears
slightly
improved. Septal thickening is improved.

3. Other findings are unchanged

4. Aorta is intact post decannulation

5. The inlet ventricular septal defect is no longer visualised.
