Admission Date:  [**2161-2-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2161-2-11**]


Service:  MICU/[**Hospital1 212**]
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fevers, low blood pressures and decreased
O2 sats.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old
white female with a history of dementia and prior
systolic blood pressures, hypertension with blood pressures
of 88/30 and hypoxia into the 80s with increased somnolence.
Of note the patient had recently presented to the Emergency
Room on [**2161-1-31**] with facial redness on the left and had
been diagnosed with V1 zoster corneal involvement and she had
been sent back to her nursing home with Acyclovir and
erythromycin ointment.  While she was at her nursing facility
admission with hypotension with blood pressures of 90s/50s
where as her baseline is in the 110s.  The O2 sats were in
the mid 80s, 85 to 89%.  She also was noted to have some
increased somnolence.  She was sent to the Emergency Room at
[**Hospital1 69**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Stroke in [**3-18**], which revealed left thalamic capsular
insult.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  History of right hip fracture.
4.  History of hearing impairment.
5.  History of pancreatitis.
6.  Echocardiogram in [**3-18**], which revealed an ejection
fraction of 45%.  The left atria was mildly dilated.  There
was mild regional left ventricular hypokinesis of the distal
septum
7.  History of peripheral neuropathy.
8.  Hysterectomy.
9.  Severe dementia.
10.  Given the history of cerebrovascular accident the
patient had a history of aspiration and she had a G tube
placed.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Acyclovir 800 mg five times a day,
Erythromycin optical ointment.  Aspirin 325 mg po q day,
Colace 100 mg po b.i.d., Milk of Magnesia, Metoprolol 25 mg
po q.a.m., 12.5 mg po q p.m., Remeron 30 mg po q.h.s.,
Sorbitol 70% in G tube.  Cyclogyl eye drops.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a resident of [**Hospital3 1761**] facility and her son is [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 105831**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 99.6.  Heart
rate 76.  Blood pressure 107/45.  Respirations 14.  Sating
92% on 100% nonrebreather.  In general, the patient was an
elderly ill appearing female, somnolent, minimally
responsive. HEENT showed irregular surgical right pupil with
left rash in the V1 distribution.  Dry mucous membranes.  No
neck stiffness.  Chest revealed occasional crackles at the
bases.  Heart regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or
gallops.  Abdomen soft with good bowel sounds.  Extremities
were with no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Neurological the
patient was responsive to painful stimulus only.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count was 8.8,
hematocrit 27.9, platelets 279.  The differential was 47%
neutrophils, 40% bands.  Chem 7 on admission sodium 132, K
5.9, chloride 95, bicarb 26, BUN 65, creatinine 1.4, glucose
154, coags INR 1.0, PTT 26.7.  Urinalysis on admission showed
moderate leukocyte esterase, small blood, 50 white blood
cells, 20 red blood cells, few bacteria, less then 1
epithelial cells.  Electrocardiogram on admission normal
sinus rhythm at a rate of 78.  Normal intervals.  No acute
STT wave changes.  Chest x-ray showed hazy hilar opacities
consistent with possible pulmonary edema.  There are also
bilateral pleural effusions noted.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a
history of cerebrovascular accident in the past with recent
history of V1 zoster presenting now with hypotension with
borderline blood pressures, hypoxia and fever who presented
with questionable opacity on chest x-ray as well as a dirty
urinalysis.

1.  Pulmonary:  The patient's initial blood gas given her
hypoxia was 7.36, 58, CO2 of 52 and 88 for the oxygen
saturation.  The patient initially had been admitted to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit for BiPAP treatment and this had
been changed to face mask as she had been clinically
improving.  Etiologies of the patient's pulmonary status may
have been secondary to aspiration pneumonia given the history
of bandemia on presentation with fever.  She had been started
on Levofloxacin and Flagyl for the aspiration pneumonia and
had improvement of her oxygen saturation.  She had a sputum
sample, which was done, however, the sputum sample was
greater then 10 epithelial cells and indicted it may have
been contaminated with oropharyngeal secretions.  In
addition, other etiology of the pulmonary symptoms may have
been secondary to some mild fluid overload as chest x-ray
showed bilateral pleural effusion and on admission also had
some hazy hilar opacities which may have been some mild
pulmonary edema.  During the course she had also been diurese
with Lasix as well. She was oberved to have difficulty handling
her secretions and required suctioning was was rather traumatic
and uncomfortable for her. She seemed to do better on Scopolamine
patch.

2.  Cardiovascular:  The patient during the hospital course
had presented with tenuous blood pressures on admission.
Likely cause sof the tenuous blood pressures probably
secondary to the recent infection.  She also had been
initially receiving fluids during the hospital course, but
may have given her decreased blood pressures and the
hypotension had resolved after receiving intravenous fluids
and 2 units of packed red blood cells.  Later on as her blood
pressure was stable she was diuresed with some Lasix as she
had extremity edema and possibly pulmonary edema as well.
Also she had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia with a
rate to the 150s.  During that course she had initially been
on diltiazem drip initially to control her heart rate.  She
converted back to normal sinus rhythm with these episodes.
As she moved out to the floor her Diltiazem drip was turned
off and her beta blocker was titrated upward during these
episodes.  While on the floor she had occasional episodes of
supraventricular tachycardia her heart rate was up into the
150s,but her blood pressures remained stable. She stopped having
episodes of SVT once her Lopressor was at 75 mg [**Hospital1 **].

3.  Renal:  The patient presented with acute renal failure
with a creatinine of 1.4, which had improved with hydration
initially to her baseline of approximately .5 and had been
stable otherwise.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient's hematocrit on admission
was 27.9, which is down from her baseline of 34.  She had a
history of guaiac positive stools, however, her hematocrit
had been stable after she had received 2 units of packed red
blood cells during the remainder of her hospital course.

5.  Infectious disease:  The patient presented with hypoxia,
temperature to 102. as well as borderline systolic blood
pressures in the 90s.  She had initially been treated with
Levofloxacin and Flagyl for aspiration pneumonia.  Her
urinalysis on admission also was dirty and the Levofloxacin
should cover any possible urinary tract infections as well.
She spiked low grade fevers and Vancomycin had been added on
[**2-8**] to cover a possible line infection. The patient had
initially a femoral line placed.  However, the blood culture
tip from the femoral line was negative and the Vancomycin was
stopped.  Also of note she had sets of blood cultures drawn,
which were from [**2161-2-4**], which were negative and from [**2-8**],
which were no growth to date.  She also had two sets of urine
cultures, which did not grow out anything as well.  Given her
clinical symptoms the patient will probably continue with the
Levofloxacin and Flagyl for the aspiration pneumonia.  Also
of note the patient had presented with zoster with ophthalmic
involvement to the Emergency Room on [**2161-1-31**] per
the Emergency Room note as possible ophthalmic nerve
involvement.  For this she was treated with Acyclovir and
Erythromycin.  She was seen by the ophthalmology services who
recommended routine ophthalmologic follow up as an
outpatient. The examination on the 25th there is no obvious
ophthalmic involvement, however, the examination was somewhat
limited  secondary to patient's mental status as it was
difficult to open the patient's eyes during the examination.
