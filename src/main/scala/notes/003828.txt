Imaging:
CXR [**6-20**] : prelim, left sided white out
.
Bedside U/S: loculated pleural effusion
.
[**6-20**] CT Ab/P/Ch c Contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiloculated large left pleural effusion with visceral and
parietal
pleural enhancement concerning for empyema.
2. Mediastinal adenopathy, likely reactive.
3. Cirrhosis. Splenomegaly and evidence of umbilical vein
recanalization,
suggestive of portal hypertension.
4. Left renal cyst.
.
[**6-24**] CT-Guided Pigtail
IMPRESSION:
Moderate to large residual loculated left upper effusion now
status post
successful 8 French modified pigtail drain catheter placement
into the pleural space. 165 mL of serosanguineous fluid was
aspirated. The findings were discussed with caring resident, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], shortly after exam completion at approximately 5:15 p.m.
via phone by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12919**]. System should be placed to suction
overnight.
.
[**6-25**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-23**] through [**2116-6-25**]:34
a.m.:

The volume of residual left pleural effusion is smaller today
than it was
yesterday and a closer apposition of pleural surfaces may
account for increase in pain. The pigtail catheter ends at the
level of the carina. Left lower lobe is essentially collapsed.
Less severe atelectasis at the right lung base is unchanged. No
right pneumothorax. Small volume of left apical pleural air is
decreasing as that compartment fills with fluid. Basal pleural
tube also unchanged in position but difficult to localize on the
single frontal view.
.
[**6-28**] CXR PA-L:

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-27**], there again are
areas of
air-fluid levels in the lateral aspect of the left hemithorax,
consistent with a complex hydropneumothorax. Chest tubes remain
in place. Right lung remains essentia
