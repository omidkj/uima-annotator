Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
back pain, chest tightness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 62 yo F with a history of schizophrenia who presents
with chest tightness, cough, dyspnea found to have a STEMI in
the ED.

The patient reports that she has had cough for approximately 1.5
weeks, dyspnea and back pain for a week. She then developed
chest tightess in the last 24 hours that was preceeded by nausea
and one episode of nonbloody emesis. The patient reports that
she has had difficulty with staying well as she in occasionally
homeless.

On review of systems, is negative except as per HPI.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of current
chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle
edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. However, she does
have occasional dyspnea, ankle edema and weight gain (that may
be related to diet)

In the ED, initial vitals were 97.4 115 110/74 18 99% RA. ST
elevations were found and CODE STEMI was called at 14:35. The
patient was given plavix 600 mg, heparin started.

The patient was immediately taken to the cath lab where the
patient would not consent to cardiac catherization.

echo
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial mass/thrombus
seen (best excluded by transesophageal echocardiography). The
right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of
the distal inferior and septal walls and apex. The apex is mildy
aneurysmal. LVEF 50%. No left ventricular thrombus is seen. The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An
eccentric, inferolaterally directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
c/w CAD (distal LAD distribution). Moderate mitral
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-12**], there is a
substantial
increase in the amount of pleural fluid on the right, which
layers out along the lateral chest wall on the decubitus view.
Smaller effusion is seen on the left. Left basilar atelectatic
change persists as does diffuse prominence of interstitial
markings that is a manifestation of background COPD.

IMPRESSION: Substantial increase in free right pleural effusion.


IMPRESSION: No DVT in both lower extremities.
CTA
VASCULAR: Small filling defects are noted within a segmental
pulmonary artery to the left lower lobe (image 3:57) and a
segmental pulmonary artery to the left upper lobe (image 3:47).
No filling defects are demonstrated within the pulmonary
arteries to the right lung. The aorta demonstrates a normal
course and caliber, without evidence of dissection or aneurysm.
The major aortic branches are widely patent.

IMPRESSION:
1. Segmental pulmonary emboli in the left lower and upper lobes.

2. Moderate-to-large right and small-to-moderate left pleural
effusions.
Associated atelectasis, including collapse of most of the right
lower lobe.
3. Calcifications in the pancreatic head, consistent with
chronic
pancreatitis.
4. Small splenic artery aneurysm.
5. Gallbladder wall edema, likely related to third spacing. Tiny

cholelithiasis.
6. Tiny volume ascites.

ECG
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Anterolateral ST segment elevation. Compared to tracing #1 the
anterolateral ST segment elevations  are not as severe. The
other findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Ms [**Last Name (un) 74715**] is a 62F w schizophrenia, admitted
with a possible STEMI, but refused cardiac cath and was later
instead diagnosed with likely myocarditis.
.
# Coronaries: Given ST elevations and chest pain, the patient
was taken to the cath lab but refused cath.  Medical management
of STEMI was implemented, including heparin and eptifibatide
drips, plavix, ASA 325, statin, beta bl
