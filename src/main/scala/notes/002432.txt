Per her daughter the patient woke up in the a.m. did not eat
breakfast, did not take her medications, but she was awake and
alert.  Her daughter then left for a period of time and then

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt's a 54 yo F with h/o OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome
with multiple admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure,
ASD w/ R to L shunt, HTN and pan hypopit presents with a fever
and mental status changes found to have a PaCO2 of 105 on
initial ABG in basic hypercarbic respiratory failure and
triggered by sepsis - initially tx for pulm source but later
evident to be more urospepsis with E. Coli.  (Initially covered
with vanc/zosyn/levo - later switched to to just levofloxicin.
Dosing has been challeging with pt admitted with ARF.  Pt with
period of hypotension - tx with levophed - off pressors and now
extubated 2 days ago - still with mild low grade temps am of tx
to floor.  Currently without complaints, breathing comfortably
on BiPAP (during night).

# Urosepsis/UTI - Patient admitted with fever and possible
pulmonary infiltrate as well as hypotension, so she was treated
for sepsis due to a pulmonary source (vanc/ zosyn/ levofloxacin
for legionella coverge).  Pt has had recent hospitalization so
at risk for HAP.  Additionally, pt UA was positive and urine
culture growing E. Coli that was resistent to Amp.  Pt blood
culture and sputum cx were no growth to date.  The patient was
stablized in the ICU.  Her coverage was reduced to levofloxacin
250mg q24 for urinary source of infection, but noted still with
low grade temps morning of ICU tx.  Patient's levofloxacin was
increased to 500 mg po qd.  She developed a leukocystosis to 16K
on [**2120-11-13**] with low-grade fevers to with a tmax of 100.3.  Her
right IJ CVC was removed on [**11-13**] with tip cultured.  The
patient subsequently was completely afebrile for over 24 hours
with improvemnt of her leukocytosis.  All studies to evaluate
for ongoing infection were negative to date.  Patient had rash
on leg and arms but not cellulitic in appearance.  The patient
was completely asymptomatic.  Of note, the patient is on
prednisone 5 mg po qd.
-patient to complete 5 more days of levofloxacin 500 mg po qd at
home.  Note made of hx of prolonged Qtc interval.
-Would recommend cbc check at f/u PCP visit in 2 weeks.

# Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Multiple hospitalizations
related to hypercarbic respiratory failure thought to be due to
obesity hypoventilation syndrome. At this admission, initial
PCO2 was 105 with improvement on mechanical ventilation. The
patient was successfully extubated on [**11-11**] and tolerated it
well.  Patient was continued on bipap at night.  Patient was
ambulated by PT with ambulatory sats in mid 90s.
-outpatient consideration of chronic trach or intermittant NIPPV
(this was brought up by the ICU attending).  Patient should f/u
with her pulmonologist.

# HTN: Pt BP medication were initially held due to hypotension.
She was restarted on her home clonidine, valsartan, and
metoprolol as outpatient.

#Acute on chronic, Diastolic CHF: Pt was restarted on her home
lasix.

#ARF: Resolved during admission. Baseline creatinine is 0.9.

#Hypernatremia: Serum Na 155 on am of discharge.  Repeat sodium
checked.  Likely secondary to free water deficit and/or steroid
replacemnt for pan-hypo pit.

# Panhypopituitarism: Partially empty sella, currently on
desmopressin, levothyroxine, prednisone at home.
- continuing these medications at the current dosage
(replacement dosing).

#Anemia: MCV normocytic. Stable.
