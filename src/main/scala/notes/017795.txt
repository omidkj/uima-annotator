Admission Date:  [**2151-6-5**]       Discharge Date:  [**2151-6-9**]

Date of Birth:                    Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 3314**] is an 89-year-old
male with a past medical history significant for diabetes
mellitus and hypertension who presents with a two day history
of reflux like chest discomfort and shortness of breath who
was in his usual state of health until two days prior to
admission when he began to notice epigastric pain that was
relieved with Zantac.  He had no epigastric pain the
following day, however two days prior to admission he had
increased shortness of breath with increased fatigue and
increased pallor noticed by his family.  His dyspnea became
especially marked over the last 24 hours prior to admission
with severe dyspnea with walking up one flight of stairs on
the day of admission.

Mr. [**Known lastname 40282**] cardiac risk factors include a positive
tobacco history.  He quit cigar smoking 12 years ago.
History of hypertension, history of diabetes mellitus, prior
congestive heart failure symptoms at baseline.  The patient
has variable lower extremity edema and has been treated with
variable doses of Maxzide titrated to his level of edema.  He
is very functional at baseline, able to walk one half block
before becoming dyspneic.  He has no orthopnea and has no
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

On presentation to the Emergency Department, the patient had
a blood pressure of 80/40 with a heart rate of 75 and an exam
with bibasilar crackles.  His electrocardiogram showed ST
segments, elevations in leads 2, 3 and AVF, as well as in
leads V5 and V6.  He was given aspirin and started on a
heparin drip for suspicion of acute coronary syndrome leading
to hypotension.  Due to his hypotension in the setting of
electrocardiogram changes, he was taken emergently to the
cardiac catheterization lab.  His catheter showed a diffuse
tubular 80% mid LAD stenosis as well as an 80% D1 stenosis.
It showed a total occlusion of the OM2 of a non dominant left
circumflex.  This lesion was stented.  His OM1 was also
totally occluded with left to left collaterals established.
The RCA system demonstrated a total occlusion of a PDA with
left to right septal collaterals.  Right heart
catheterization showed a right atrial pressure of 18, a
pulmonary artery pressure of 50/21 and a capillary wedge
pressure of 24.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Mr. [**Known lastname 3314**] lives with his son.  [**Name (NI) **] has a
positive tobacco history, quit cigar smoking 12 years ago.
No alcohol history.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

INITIAL IMPRESSION:  An 89-year-old male presented with chest
discomfort and shortness of breath with presentation
apparently due to recent myocardial infarction.  Patient with
evidence of end organ dysfunction with elevated creatinine in
the setting of hypotension with his event now status post
stent to the left circumflex system at the OM2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Mr. [**Known lastname 3314**] did quite well status post
his cardiac catheterization.  He was started on dopamine for
pressure support prior to arrival in the cardiac
catheterization lab.  The stent of his left circumflex system
went without complication and he was transferred to the CCU
where he was quickly weaned off of dopamine.  He was started
on aspirin and Plavix.  He was then started on a beta blocker
and ACE inhibitor and these were titrated as tolerated by his
blood pressure.  His lipid panel was excellent with an HDL of
71, an LDL of 58 and triglycerides of 40 so lipid lowering
drug which was initially started was discontinued prior to
discharge.  A transthoracic echocardiogram was done on the
third hospital day which showed an ejection fraction of 30%
to 35% with mild left atrial enlargement.  It showed 1+
mitral regurgitation as well as akinesis of the apex with
diffuse hypokinesis through the left ventricle.  The patient
was maintained on telemetry throughout his hospital stay and
had minimal events on telemetry with only one episode of
nonsustained ventricular tachycardia of 5 beats on the day
after his intervention.  He was otherwise in sinus rhythm
throughout his hospital stay.

2.  HEME:  Mr. [**Known lastname 3314**] was transfused 2 units of blood
during this cardiac catheterization and in the immediate post
catheterization.  Due to an initial hematocrit of 23,
hematocrit improved to 24.5 with these transfusions.  Despite
the small increase in hematocrit with 2 units of blood, it
was not thought that he was losing blood through his
gastrointestinal tract due to his negative stool guaiac test.
One additional unit of packed red blood cells was transferred
during his stay on the floor after transfer from the CCU.
His hematocrit remained around 25 at the time of discharge.
Epogen may be helpful for Mr. [**Known lastname 3314**] in the future, but
iron studies and Epogen level prior to initiation of therapy
would help guide therapy given his recent transfusions doing
these studies in approximately one month would be most
beneficial.

3.  RENAL:  The patient's creatinine on admission was 2.1,
however with improvement in his blood pressures and presumed
cardiac function after his intervention, his creatinine
improved back to baseline with a nadir of 1.0.  He maintained
good urine output throughout his hospital stay.

4.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient's liver enzymes on the
second hospital day were consistent with a shock liver
pattern.  His AST was 1488.  His ALT was 1310 with a normal
alkaline phosphatase of 74 and normal total bilirubin of 0.4.
His transaminases continued to trend down steadily throughout
his hospital stay with an ALT of 597 and an AST of 169 on one
day prior to discharge.  He was also started on proton pump
inhibitor during this hospital stay for gastrointestinal
protection.

5.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient is normally on Avandia and
DiaBeta for his glucose control.  His glucose was well
controlled with sliding scale insulin through his hospital
stay.  On the day of discharge, his DiaBeta was restarted.
His Avandia should be held for several days after discharge
due to his elevated liver enzymes and should
