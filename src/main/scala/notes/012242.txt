Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
referred for elective cardiac cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization
PCI with angioplasty and drug eluting stents

History of Present Illness:
60 year old woman with prior history of anterior MI, s/p lysis
with subsequent cath revealing only 45% LAD, CHF (EF 30%),
severe COPD who presented with several days of increasing DOE.
She indicates that these symptoms, as well as some epigastric
burning pain, have all been worseing over the past several
weeks. The epigastric burning is usually at night, and is
relieved with maalox / rolaids
.
She had an ETT as an outpatient two months ago that showed a
fixed apical defect. Two months ago admitted with CHF. Echo
revealing an LVEF of 35% with severe pulmonary HTN and apical
WMA. Diuresed. Had been stable at home for the past months on
diuretics, admitted on the 27th with two episodes of severe SOB
and chest burning. Ruled out for MI.
.
Underwent dobutamine echo at the OSH and had similar chest
burning with elevation of HR during dobutamine infusion.
Anterior wall remained AK, other walls fine.
.
Patient was transferred to the ICU at 3am on [**2155-10-31**] after she
went in to flash pulmonary edema. BP 174/100, she was started on
a Nitro gtt and given 80mg IV lasix. Patient diuresed 2100cc. Of
note, at that time, a chest xray did not reveal pulmonary edema.
At 5am BP 92/58- Nitro gtt off. She is currently stable, able to
lay flat without difficulty. She has heparin @ 1100units/hr.
[**10-30**] INR 0.9
.
Review of Systems: Otherwise she has been feeling fine. She
endorses PND, orthopnea, but no edema. She can walk less than
one city block at baseline before getting SOB.

Cardiac Catheterization: [**2155-10-31**]
1.  Selective coronary angiography in this left dominant system
revealed three vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was
normal.
The LAD had a 70% stenosis in the mid segment, mild disease
throughout,
and a very small D1 with a 90% lesion.  The LCx was subtotally
occluded
just before the lPDA. The RCA was a small nondominant artery
with
diffuse disease.
2.  Limited hemodynamic assessment demonstrated elevated left
sided
filling pressures with an LVEDP of 25.  There was systemic
arterial
hypertension with an SBP of 160 mmHg and DBP of 93 mmHg.
3. Successful direct stenting was performed of the mid LAD with
a 2.5x13
mm Cypher stent.  Final angiography revealed 0% residual
stenosis, no
dissection, and normal flow.  (see PTCA comments)
4. Successful PTCA and stenting was performed of the distal CX
with a
2.5x23 mm Cypher stent.  Final angiography revealed 0% residual
stenosis, no dissection, and normal flow.  (see PTCA comments)
5. Right femoral arteriotomy site closed with a 6F Angioseal
device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated left sided filling pressures.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the mid LAD and distal CX
with drug
eluting stents.
.
[**2155-11-2**]: CTA chest - 1. Severe emphysema. 2. No evidence of
pulmonary embolism. 3. Coronary artery calcifications.
.
[**2155-11-3**]: ECHO (TTE) -
The LA is normal in size. LV wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. There is mild regional LV systolic dysfunction with
focal severe hypokinesis of the distal half of the septum,
distal anterior wall, basal inferior wall and apex. The
remaining LV segments contract normally. RV chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The AV leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.  The MV leaflets are structurally normal.
There is no MV prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-2**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel
CAD. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.

.
[**2155-11-4**] CXR: The heart is normal in size. The cardiac
silhouette, mediastinal and hilar contours, and pleural surfaces
are normal. The pulmonary vasculature is normal and there is no
pneumothorax. The lungs are hyperinflated, similar to [**2155-11-4**].
The lungs are clear. There are no pleural effusions or
pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of pneumonia, unchanged compared to
[**2155-11-4**]. 2. Hyperinflation indicating emphysematous disease
shown to be extensive on CTA [**2155-11-2**].


Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 60F CAD, severe COPD, DM who was
referred for cardiac catheterization who underwent PCI, however
her course was complicated by respiratory distress and GNR
bacteremia.
.
1. Respiratory distress: The patient developed sudden onset
respiratory distress and new oxygen requirement this was thought
c/w a COPD exacerbation. Pt had a h/o severe emphysema with FEV1
of 0.8. Wheezing has remained the predominant finding on exam.
Despite her multiple episodes of SOB here and at [**Location (un) 620**], her
CXRs have all remaied clear. However the cath showed LVEDP of
25, which raises the possibility that some pulmonary vascular
congestion may be contributing to the bronchospasm. Another
possibility is dye allergy given the shellfish allergy, although
this did not seem likely given the contrast load during the cath
that was tolerated well. She was treated with steroids,
bronchdilators, and antibiotics.  She did receive a dose of
lasix and was briefly placed on a nitroglycerin gtt for
presumptive pulmonary edema, but much of her recovery was
thought secondary to the COPD therapy.  Her home dose of
beta-blocker was held until her respiratory status improved. She
will complete a 2 week course of steroids, as well as
levofloxacin for 14 days.  At the time of discharge, she was
feeling very comfortable, but still requiring two liters of
oxygen via nasal cannula.  She would desaturate to SpO2 87% with
ambulation.  She was discharged with home oxygen and visiting
nurse to monitor lung exam, oxygenation.
.
2. Cardiac
a. Coronary artery disease: The patient was referred for
elective cardiac cath after having an indeterminate dobutamine
stress echo at the OSH.  The cath revealed 3-vessel disease.  As
her severe COPD (FEV1 <1 L) would limit the safety of CABG, an
LAD lesion and LCx lesion were treated with angioplasty and DES
(please see full cath report for details). Her CK peak was only
56.  She will continue on aspirin 325, plavix, statin, and ACE
inhibitor. Her beta-blocker was held temporarily and was resumed
by time of discharge.
.
b. Pump:
The patient has a history of CHF with EF 30%.  She had been
treated for CHF exacerbation on her prior episodes however it is
unclear why she seemed to respond to diuresi
