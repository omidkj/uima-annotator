Bronchoscopy: Stain POSITIVE for PCP. +Atypical cells, unknown
etiology - could not exclude lymphoid origin
.
CXR: [**11-5**] -
Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged and pulmonary vascularity
remains
engorged.  Diffuse hazy opacities have progressed bilaterally
accompanied by underlying interstitial opacities.  Additionally,
a more confluent asymmetric area of airspace opacification has
developed in the left perihilar region. Although at least
partially due to pulmonary edema, coexisting infection should be
considered, particularly in the left upper lobe.

CTA chest [**11-13**]
CONCLUSION:
1. Extensive ground-glass change along with subpleural
reticulation, airtrapping and traction bronchiectasis most
likely representing the known PCP infective change.
2. Renal hypodensities are incompletely assessed and may
represent cysts. The left kidney is atrophic.
3. No pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.

[**Last Name (un) **] pathology [**2195-11-19**]
INTERPRETATION
Non-specific T-cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic
immunophenotypic features of involvement by B-cell lymphoma are
not seen in specimen.  Correlation with clinical findings and
morphology is recommended.  Flow cytometry immunotherapy may not
detect all lymphomas due to topography, sampling or artifacts of
sample preparation.
.
cytometry: Atypical cell present, favor reactive pneumocytes.
Pulmonary macrophages, inflammatory cells and blood. No viral
cytopathic effects seen.
.
ECHO [**11-19**]:
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D or
saline contrast. Images were suboptimal - a patent foramen ovale
or secundum ASD cannot be definitively excluded on the basis of
this study


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 66 y/o M w/ NHL-DLBCL with primary involvement of the
distal esophagus and proximal stomach, s/p R-[**Hospital1 **] p/w
neutropenic fever with episode of symptomatic SVT with
hypotension now in NSR without intervention.
.
# PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**]: Upon admission - CXR c/w multi-focal pneumonia.
 Pt with tachypnea and respiratory alkalosis. Fever as high as
103.3. Previously started on cefepime and levofloxacin for
neutropenic fever (ANC 240 on admission). Gran ct quickly rose
to normal levels. Initial sputum cx showed 1+ GPC in pairs but
negative for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] maintained high suspicion due to
bilateral infiltrate on CXR, rising LDH and hypoxia.
Bronchoscopy [**11-6**] --> Positive for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] with a component
of heart failure requiring diuresis. Pt. required intubation
soon after bronchoscopy but tolerated a slow wean and was
extubated on [**11-9**].  He continued to remain respiratorily
tenuous though was gradually improving until he was reintubated
again a couple weeks later for desaturations. He the had a
protracted course with pulmonary microatelectasis complicated by
barotrauma, pneumothoraces, and oxygen toxicity from ventilation
with high O2 and pressure/volume requirements.  He underwent 2
BALs with no addititive information, and he has continued to
decline despite antibiotic therapy, steroids, and a trial of
proning.  After everything within reason was done, he was
declared CMO by his family and allowed to expire on the morning
of [**2195-12-3**].
.
# Hyperkalemia: his course was also complicated by elevated
potassium.  It was probably exacerbated by the bactrim.  He was
given multiple rounds of insulin with D50 and calcium carbonate
to maintain his K below 6 until he
