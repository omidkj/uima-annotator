Service: [**Doctor First Name 147**]

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2156-9-2**] Tracheostomy
[**2156-9-16**] Open G-tube placement
[**2156-9-28**] Replacement of fenestrated tracheostomy tube with
non-fenestrated tube


History of Present Illness:
This is a 45 year old female with end-stage renal disease
secondary to diabetes mellitus (on hemodialysis since [**46**]) and
now status-post a cadaveric renal transplant in [**2149**] presenting
as a transfer from [**Hospital3 **] Healthcare for worsening renal
function. The patient's baseline Creatinine of 1.4-1.6 after her
transplant was recently elevated to 2.8. She was transferred
with other ongoing issues, including Bilateral pleural
infiltrates (left greater than the right) thought to be
secondary to pneumonia or posisbly congestive heart failure and
severe diabetic gastroparesis with persistant nausea and
vomiting limiting PO intake. On an admission in [**2156-7-23**] she was
shown to have bilateral lung infiltrates and was started on
Unasyn; she was readmitted with exacerbation of shortness of
breath on [**2156-8-5**] and drainage of pleural fluid from the level
yielded 900 cc. She had an EGD for her persistant nausea on [**8-5**]
which demonstrated esophagitis. On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2156-8-7**] she
was expressing shortness of breath but denied chest pain or
abdominal pain. She was not febrile and denied chills or rigors.
She expressed some nausea.

RADIOLOGY/CARDIOLOGY:

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2156-8-8**] 1:14 AM
IMPRESSION: Bilateral pleural effusions, with bilateral
opacities, right greater than left, consistent with air space
disease.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2156-9-12**] 1:27 AM
COMMENTS: Portable AP radiograph is reviewed, and compared with
previous study of [**2156-9-10**].
The tracheostomy tube is seen in place. The right subclavian IV
catheter terminates in the superior vena cava. The feeding tube
is coiled within the stomach.
The previously identified congestive heart failure has been
improving. There is continued mild cardiomegaly. There is no
evidence for pneumothorax.

ECHO Study Date of [**2156-8-9**]
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated.
2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular
cavity size is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic
(EF>75%).
3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.There is a small to moderate sized pericardial effusion. The
effusion
appears circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

MR CONTRAST GADOLIN  [**2156-8-22**] 2:40 PM
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST; MR CONTRAST GADOLIN
IMPRESSION:
1. No focal areas of restricted diffusion noted to suggest acute
infarct.
2. Small vessel disease as described above.

MR CONTRAST GADOLIN  [**2156-8-27**] 2:58 PM
MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST; MR CONTRAST GADOLIN
CONCLUSION: New right thalamic hemorrhage with extension into
the posterior limb of the internal capsule and into the cerebral
peduncle. This most likely represents a hypertensive hemorrhage.
Mastoid and paranasal sinus opacification.

CT HEAD [**2156-8-28**]:
Stable right thalamic hemorrhage.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2156-9-6**] 11:37 AM
CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST: There has been slight interval
reduction in size of the right thalamic hemorrhage with
surrounding edema. The ventricles are stably enlarged. No new
areas of hemorrhage are present. Differentiation of the
grey/white matter is otherwise preserved. There is opacification
of the left sphenoid sinus and left ethmoid air cells.
Additionally there is opacification of both mastoid air cells

Neurophysiology Report EEG Study Date of [**2156-9-6**]
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence
of a
slow background rhyt
