Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Latex

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3326**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Paracentesis and removal of 3L of fluid

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 70235**] is a 64 yo woman with metastatic uterine cancer,
obesity, hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presented to the
emergency department with dyspnea.
.
She was seen by her gynecologist-oncologist 2 days prior to
admission, at which time she discussed with him recent CT
findings of a large new abdominal mass. At that visit, she was
complaining of worsening shortness of breath. Per report, she
has had about a month of increasing abdominal girth and
increasing peripheral edema.
.
In the emergency department, her initial VSs were 97.7, 114,
104/40, 24, 98% RA. She received 4L NS without much change in
her blood pressure (lowest 88/58). She was intubated
semi-electively for central line placement. She was then started
on norepinephrine for mild hypotension. She also received
levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia prior to her chest CTA.
.
ROS was unobtainable as the pt was sedated and intuabted. She
denied pain in general and chest and abdominal pain in
particular.

Social History:

Family History:
mother with cervical cancer.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: 98.6 BP: 105/69 P: 99 R: 36 SaO2: 100%
General: sedated, intubated, responds to verbal stimuli,
responds appropriately to questions
HEENT: PERRL, no scleral icterus, MM dry
Pulmonary: Lungs CTA bilaterally anteriorly, no wheezes, ronchi
or rales
Cardiac: borderline tachy, distant S1 S2, no murmurs, rubs or
gallops appreciated
Abdomen: soft, ND, normoactive bowel sounds, ? of large mass in
center of abdomen, but not incredibly obvious
Extremities: 2+ pitting edema to knees bilaterally, 1+ DP pulses
bilaterally
Neurologic: Sedated, intubated, squeezes hands on command,
wiggles toes

Pertinent Results:
[**2187-12-2**] Renal U/S - No evidence of hydronephrosis

[**2187-12-3**] Paracentesis -  Successful therapeutic and diagnostic
paracentesis with aspiration of 3 L of clear amber yellow fluid.
Samples were sent for cytology and microbiology.

[**2187-12-3**] Peritoneal fluid - Atypical epithelioid cells, reactive
mesothelial cells and numerous inflammatory cells. See note.
Negative for malignant cells.
Reactive mesothelial cells and inflammatory cells.

[**2187-12-4**] CXR -  Free air in the abdomen, which is new. This was
discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4312**] at the time of dictation. No other
interval change

[**2187-12-5**] Abd xray - 1. No radiographic evidence for obstruction.
2. Persistent pneumoperitoneum.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 70235**] is a 64 yo woman with h/o uterine CA who was
admitted with recurrent disease (large intrabdominal mass), new
ascites, dyspnea and hypotension.  Her course was complicated by
likely bowel perforation due to tumor infiltration of adherant
bowel.  In setting of presumed bowel perforation she developed
increased tachypnea, tachycardia and respiratory distress.
Given her underlying malignancy, she decided not to be intubated
and chose to be comfort measures only.  She died overnight due
to respiratory failure from underlying bowel perforation and
increased abdominal free air.
.
1) Respiratory distress: On admission, her symptoms of dyspnea
were most likely [**12-22**] ascites and increased intra-abdominal
pressure.  She was intubated in the emergency department for
respiratory distress and inability to tolerate lying flat.  She
had ultrasound guided paracentesis and removal of 3L of ascitic
fluid.  She was extubated the following day without problem
however she continued to be tachypnic.  The following day her
respiratory status worsening in setting of suspected bowel
perforation.  She chose not to be intubated and died over night
due to respiratory distress likely from increasing abdominal
free air, abdominal mass, ascites and bowel perforation.  She
was treated with a morphine drip for symptoms of respiratory
distress.  She died overnight.
.
2)Intra-abdominal free air - visible on CXR and KUB most likely
due to bowel perforation most likely caused by tumor erosion
into adherant bowel. Surgery consulted and after discussion with
GYN-ONC and given patients underlying malignancy it was decided
that she is not a good operative candidate.  This was discussed
at length with the patient and she chose to be comfort measures
only at this point.  She was treated with vancomycin and zosyn
for bowel perforation.
.
3)Ascites: Likely related to large intrabdominal mass/recurrent
CA. She had bedside US guided paracentesis, with the removal of
3 liters. Cell counts show 9700 WBC (89% polys), and 1+ Budding
yeast, concerning for SBP.  She was treated with zosyn and
fluconazole.
.
4)Uterine CA: Recurrent disease, per oncology palliative
treatment at this time.
.
5) LE edema: Most likely due to IVC compression by large volume
ascites. No evidence of PE on CTA.
