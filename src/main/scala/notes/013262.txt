History of Present Illness:
80 year old male with MMP including DMII, hyperlipedemia, CRF,
COPD who presented with intestinal angina and was admitted by
vascular surgery for possible stenting. As per the patient his
abdominal symptoms occurred only when he was at dialysis about
[**3-1**] of the way through. Patient was also having symptoms of
abdominal cramping. Both of these sytmpoms were felt to be
related to poor abdominal blood floor. Paitent was admitted to
vascular surgery and underwent routine angiogram on [**2152-1-18**] with
stent placement to SMA. Patient appparently in the PACU had very
difficult to control pain requiring multiple nitroglycerins with
some relief.  Patient ruled in with NSTEMI with troponins
peaking to 0.89 and CK- MB to 34. Cardiology was consulted and
patient underwent cardiac catherization and was found to have
3VD. C-surgery was consulted and pt was deemed not a surgical
candidate for CABG, thus it was decided that pt would undergo
staged PCI. Plan current was for staged PCI to begin on Monday.

On transfer patient denies any current symptoms. Denies current
chest pain, abdominal pain, or shortness of breath. Patient has
severly depressed exercise tolerance. Patient states he can
barely walk a few feet without getting short of breath. Patient
also endorses chest pain with exertion that occurs when patient
walks just a few steps.  Patient states this pain improves with
rest.  Patient also endorses sleeping sitting up as he feels
uncomfortable if he is lying down flat. Patient states that
sometimes he sleeps upright in a chair because it is more
comfortable. IN addition, patient endorses + PND. Denies current
lower extremity swelling although he states that he previously
has had bilateral lower extremity swelling.

Past Medical History:
CAD
HTN
DMII - insulin dependent
hyperlipedemia
CRF - HD M/W/F
COPD- home O2 2L at night
Carotid stenosis s/p LCEA
CHF, dialstolic
Paget's disease
b/l total knee replacement
removal of neck cyst in [**2080**]

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. Pt quit smoking 4 years ago. Prior to that patient smoked
[**12-31**] pack of cigarettes from age 6 on = 35 year pack smoking
history. There is no history of alcohol abuse. Patient states he
drinks socially.

There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death.

Reports-
Cath [**2152-1-20**]
COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
three
vessel CAD.  The LMCA had mild luminal irregularities.  The LAD
was a
tortuous vessel with a 95% calcified mid vessel lesion.  The LCx
had a
99% mid vessel lesion. The RCA serial 90% proximal and mid
vessel
lesions.
2.  Hemodynamic evaluation revealed severely elevated right and
left
sided filling pressures.  The pulmonary arterial systolic
pressure was
severely elevated at 65mm Hg.  Mean PCWP was elevated at 31 mm
Hg.
Systemic arterial pressures were elevated at 132 mm Hg.  Cardiac
index
was preserved at 3.94 l/min/m2.
3.  Left ventriculography revealed no mitral regurgitation.
LVEF was
60% with normal regional wall motion.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severely elevated biventricular filling pressures.
3. Pulmonary arterial systolic hypertension.

Cath [**2152-1-25**]
COMMENTS:
1- Successful stenting of the mid LCX with two overlapping
Microdriver
BMSs (2.5x18 and 2.5x8 mm). Final anfiography revealed 0%
residual
stenosis with TIMIn III flow and no dissection or distal emboli.

2- Failed attempt to cross the LAD into the diagonal.


FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful stenting of the mid LCX with two overlapping bare
metal
stents.
3. Failed attempt to cross the LAD lesion.

COMMENTS:
1- Sucecssful rotablation, PTCA and stenting of the proximal-mid
RCA
with two overlapping Driver BMSs (3.5x15 and 3.5x24 mm). Final
angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis and no dissection or
distal
emboli.
2- Partially successful deployment of an 8 French Angioseal
closure
device to the left CFA with limited bleeding that responded to
compression.
3- Vagal reaction requiring Dopamine infusion.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Successful rotablation, PTCA and stenting
