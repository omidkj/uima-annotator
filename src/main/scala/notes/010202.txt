History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 YOM with significant CAD, CHF, and renal failure on
HD who presents with dyspnea. HE was hospitalized in [**2-16**] for
acute decompensated heart failure requiring ballon pump. After a

dyspnea or chest pain. 2 days prior to admission developed
dyspnea while lying in bed. No changes in his medications at
rehab. No change in low salt diet. No missed dialysis sessions.
No fever or cough. No chest pain or paplitations. Significant
dyspnea at rest and orthopnea.

Social History:
SH: Retired firefighter. Married. Used to smoke cigars and
occasionally cigarettes but quit in the [**2087**]. No EtOH.


Family History:
FH: mother - died in 50s suddenly, unknown causes; brother -
"heart problems"

Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 108/90 mm Hg while seated. Pulse was
97beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 30 breaths/min. He
appeared in respiratory distress, using accessory mouscles to
breath with paradoxical diaphragmatic movement. The patient was
oriented to person, place and time. The patient's mood and
affect were not inappropriate.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple with
JVD up to the angle of the jaw. There was no thyromegaly. The
were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis. The lungs
decreased bilaterally with expiratory wheeze heard through out..

There were no thrills, lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The heart
sounds distant, revealed a normal S1 and the S2 was normal.
Unable to hear any rubs, murmurs, clicks or gallops.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was
soft nontender and nondistended. The extremities cool and had no
pallor, cyanosis, clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal,
femoral or carotid bruits. Inspection and/or palpation of skin
and subcutaneous tissue showed multiple weal healed ulcers.
Pulses:
Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 0 PT 0
Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 0 PT 0


Pertinent Results:
C.Cath [**2124-2-22**]:
1. Severe left main and a three vessel coronary artery disease.

2. Cardiogenic shock requiring IABP for hemodynamic support.
3. Severe systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction.
4. Severe MR improved with IABP and diuresis.
.
C.Cath [**2124-3-3**]:
1. Severe three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI of the major D1.
3. Partially successful PCI of LAD with focal in-stent
underexpansion
with high risk of restenosis.
.
EKG demonstrated sinus with bigeminy. rate 87. nl axis. nl
intervals. no st changes. TWI in V3 v4 v5, III, AVF
.
TELEMETRY demonstrated:sinus tach
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**3-15**] demonstrated:
1.No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2.There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesia of the apex, mid and apical
portions of the inferolateral,lateral and inferior walls.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed.
3.Right ventricular function is mildly depressed.
4.There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**1-11**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. Tip of the intraortic balloon pump in good position.
8. Post percutaneous intervention ejection fraction is slightly
improved.
.
CXR - Comparison is made to [**2124-3-13**]. The heart is normal in
size. Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. A double
lumen right tunneled central jugular venous catheter terminates
at the cavoatrial junction. There is mild interstitial edema
with fluid in the right minor fissure. There is also left
basilar retrocardiac opacity, which is vaguely defined and
mostly linear in character, which may represent atelectatic
change but is nonspecific. There is no pneumothorax.
.
CTA [**5-20**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Left upper lobe bronchopneumonia/aspiration.
2. Bibasilar atelectasis/collapse.
3. Incompletely evaluated distended gallbladder and wall
thickening. Ultrasound can provide further information if
indicated as differential included third-spacing versus
acalculus cholecystitis.
4. Severe atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Dyspnea: Patient was admitted to the CCU due to his
hypotension requiring dopamine gtt.  In the CCU he underwent
dialysis with improvement in his symptoms.  On the evening of
admission, the patient was noted to be acutely unresponsive and
turned blue.  Telemetry revealed an initial rhythm of PEA then
quickly converted to vfib.  A code was called.  During the code
he was shocked several times, given epi, calcium, d5, insulin,
and bicarb. He then had runs of VT and was shocked with that,
with intermittent loss of pulse. ECG was c/w inferior STEMI. He
was also given amiodarone 150 mg load and started on amio gtt.
He had a bradycardia and was started on dopamine and transiently
levophed. One etiology considered for his arrest was PE as he
was blue from shoulders up at the beginning of code. Heparin gtt
started for treatment of MI or PE.  He was intubated and
remained stable overnight on pressors.  Given the concern for PE
the patient underwent CTA which showed no evidence of clot.
.
# Hypotension: Following cardiac arrest the patient continued to
require pressors for BP support.  On [**5-20**] his hemodynamics
continued to worsen requiring addition of more pressors for
support.  On EKG he had worsening ST elevations in the anterior
leads.  Given he was deemed to be not a surgical candidate he
was continued on medical management.  Over the course of the
evening on [**5-20**] his status continued to worsen. He spiked a
temp. to 102 and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for
presumed sepsis.  During this time he had recurrent episodes of
VT and was shocked for these with return to narrow-complex
rhythm.  Given his worsening status despite multiple pressors
and recurrent arrythmias a discussion was had with the patient's
wife and decision was made to make the patient DNR.  He was made
comfortable and expired at 5am on [**5-21**].
