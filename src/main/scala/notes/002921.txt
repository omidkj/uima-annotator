GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. The rhythm appears to be atrial fibrillation. Results
were

Conclusions:
PRE-CPB The left atrium is markedly dilated. Moderate to severe
spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No
mass/thrombus is seen
in the left atrium or left atrial appendage. Moderate to severe
spontaneous
echo contrast is present in the left atrial appendage. The left
atrial
appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). The right
atrium is
elongated. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the right
atrium or right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
There is mild
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There are simple
atheroma in
the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are
mildly thickened. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

POST-CPB Normal right ventricular systolic function. Left
ventricle initially
with some mild septal hypokinesis which improved after 15
minutes. Overall EF
about 50-55%. No other changes from pre-CPB.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 8026**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2165-9-30**] for further
management of her chest pain. She underwent a cardiac
catheterization which revealed 95% mid LAD lesion, 80% LCX
stenosis,and a 99% diffuse RCA lesion.  An echo showed an EF of
60-70%. Given the nature and severity of her disease, the
cardiac surgery service was consulted for surgical
revascularization. She was worked-up in the usual preoperative
manner including a carotid duplex ultrasound which showed
minimal internal carotid artery disease bilaterally.
Ciprofloxacin was started for a urinary tract infection. Heparin
was continued for anticoagulation. On [**2165-10-4**], Ms. [**Known lastname 8026**] was
taken to the operating room where she underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting to four vessels and a left atrial appendage
ligation. Postoperatively she was transferred to the cardiac
surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. She developed some
atrial fibrillation overnight that was self limited. On
postoperative day one, Ms. [**Known lastname 8026**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact
and was extubated. She was transfused for postoperative anemia.
Coumadin was resumed for her atrial fibrillation. On
postoperative day three, she was transferred to the step down
unit for further recovery. She was gently diuresed towards her
preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was consulted
for assistance with her postoperativ strength and mobility. The
geriatrics service was consulted for assistance with her memory
loss. Multiple medications as well as a social work evaluation
were recommended and implemented. It is recommended that she
follow up with the neurobehaviorist after discharge (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 6817**].

Ms. [**Known lastname 8026**] continued to make steady progress and was discharged
to rehab on [**2165-10-15**] in stable condition. She will follow-up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**], her cardiologist and her primary care
physician as an outpatient.
