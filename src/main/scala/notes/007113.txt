HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 43 year old man
with diabetes mellitus times twenty years, end stage renal
disease on dialysis times two months, with right permacath
present, who presents with fevers to 103.7 times two days,
positive chills, positive nausea and vomiting, decreased p.o.
intake times two days, also mild watery diarrhea with cough
and mild shortness of breath.  Of note, the patient had left
foot debridement surgery for osteomyelitis on the left second
digit per podiatry.  He had good granulation tissue of the
site.  He was getting Oxacillin two grams q4hours until
[**2102-3-10**].  In the Emergency Department, temperature was
102.2, pulse 90, blood pressure 113/59, respiratory rate 20,
oxygen saturation 100% in room air.  The patient had culture
of the Hickman at dialysis but before dialysis had decreased
blood pressure to 90/40 with his pulse increasing to 115 and
then 160s with supraventricular tachycardia.  The patient
received Adenosine in the Emergency Department with no effect
and he was then cardioverted successfully.  His heart rate
went to 116.  He received Vancomycin and Gentamicin in the
Emergency Department and two liters of normal saline.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Pulse 111, blood pressure 92/47,
respiratory rate 23, oxygen saturation 100% on four liters
nasal cannula.  In general, the patient is an ill appearing
white male in no acute distress.  The pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  The oropharynx is clear.  Mucous
membranes are dry.  Jugular venous distention is flat.  The
lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  The heart is
regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2, II/VI systolic murmur at
the left upper sternal border.  The abdomen reveals mild
diffuse tenderness, positive bowel sounds, nondistended.
Extremities revealed trace edema.  Neurologically, the
patient is alert and oriented times three.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 13.6, hematocrit
40.0, platelets clumped, 83% neutrophils, 15% bands, 1%
lymphocytes, 1% monocytes.  Sodium 130, potassium 4.3,
chloride 92, bicarbonate 17, blood urea nitrogen 69,
creatinine 10.2, glucose 194.

Chest x-ray showed no pneumonia.  Echocardiogram from
[**2102-2-14**], showed moderate left ventricular hypertrophy,
bicuspid aortic valve, no mitral regurgitation, no tricuspid
regurgitation, no vegetation.  Electrocardiogram after
cardioversion revealed normal sinus rhythm at 150 beats per
minute.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular - The patient was admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit following his supraventricular
tachycardia.  The patient remained stable following
conversion.  He was started back on his Lopressor for rate
control.  He was then transferred to the floor.  On the
floor, he remained stable, however, he remained persistently
tachycardic.  This was felt to be due to his underlying
infection, however, his beta blocker was titrated up.  The
patient was started back on his ace inhibitor and started
back on his statin.  Upon discharge, the patient was taking
Aspirin, Atenolol 100 mg once daily, Lisinopril 30 mg once
daily, Lipitor 10 mg once daily.

2.  Infectious disease - The patient was initially started on
Vancomycin and Gentamicin for possible Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis.   The patient's blood
cultures came back coagulase positive Staphylococcus from his
dialysis catheter.  His dialysis catheter was removed.  The
patient's cultures came back MSSA.  His Vancomycin and
Gentamicin were discontinued.  The patient was switched over
to Oxacillin.  The patient started complaining of pleuritic
chest pain along with pain in his back and left
sternoclavicular region.  The patient had chest CT done which
showed numerous nodules, one of which was cavitating
suggestive of pulmonary emboli.  The patient had an upper
extremity ultrasound done to evaluate for possible source of
septic emboli.  This was negative.  The patient also had a
transesophageal echocardiogram done to evaluate for
endocarditis.  The patient's transesophageal echocardiogram
showed that the right valves were clean.  On the left, mitral
valve was thickened, and a small minimally mobile strand was
seen on the left atrial side at the base of the anterior
leaflet without associated mitral regurgitation at that site.
Differential for the strand included fibrinous strand versus
small vegetation.  Aortic valve was moderately thickened but
no discrete masses or vegetation were seen on the aortic
valve.  Due to the possibility of vegetation, it was decided
that the patient would be treated for six week course of
intravenous antibiotics.  As the patient was complaining of
pain in his back and supraclavicular joint region, a bone
scan was ordered.  Bone scan showed no signs of osteomyelitis
or abscess.  The patient had persistent swelling at the time
of the sternoclavicular region.  CT surgery was consulted and
attempts were made to aspirate possible abscess.  No pocket
was found on aspiration, however, was sent and grew out MSSA.
It is likely that this represents a small abscess.  Status
post procedure, the pain improved in the sternoclavicular
region.  The patient defervesced.  His blood cultures grew
MSSA until [**2102-4-24**], following surveillance cultures were all
negative.  The patient's liver function tests began rising
several days after starting on Oxacillin and it was felt that
it was due to the Oxacillin.  His Oxacillin was discontinued
and the patient was started on Cefazolin.  The patient
tolerated the Cefazolin and will be dosed with two grams of
Cefazolin following hemodialysis.  The patient had low grade
fevers and persistent nausea and vomiting.  In an attempt to
evaluate for possible abdominal abscess, ultrasound was
performed.  Ultrasound revealed splenomegaly but no other
obvious foci. Splenomegaly likely reflects his infective
endocarditis.  The patient had abdominal CT done which showed
no obvious abscess.  A repeat chest CT was done and showed
decrease in size of his pulmonary nodules.  It is presumed
that these septic emboli were thrown when the dialysis
catheter was pulled.  The patient received over two weeks of
intravenous antibiotics while hospitalized and will receive
another four weeks duration of intravenous antibiotics.

3.  Hearing loss - During hospital course, the patient
developed acute hearing loss.  This was preceded with right
sided tinnitus followed by hearing loss along with nausea,
vomiting on standing.  The patient denied having sensation of
vertigo.  ENT was consulted and an audiogram was performed
which confirmed right sided sensineural hearing loss.  The
patient was started on Prednisone 60 mg once daily for seven
days.  The patient had repeat audiology examination six days
later which still showed hearing loss in the right ear.  The
patient did say that his balance improved after starting
Prednisone.  The patient will be discharged on Prednisone
taper and will follow-up with ENT, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], in one week.
