Microbiology:
[**2148-12-8**] Blood cultures: pending, no growth to date
[**2148-12-8**] Urine culture: negative
[**2148-12-9**] Blood culture: pending, no growth to date
.
Imaging:
[**2148-12-8**] EKG: One hundred percent A-V paced. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2148-1-29**] no diagnostic interval change.
.
[**2148-12-8**] Left Humerus X-ray: Three views of the left shoulder
are slightly limited, though were the best obtainable given the
patient's level of discomfort per the performing radiographic
technologist. Note is made of a subtrochanteric left humeral
fracture with some impaction of the humeral shaft into the
humeral head. There is no evidence of dislocation of the humeral
head. There is no other fracture or dislocation. A cardiac
pacing device is partially imaged
.
[**2148-12-8**] CXR: Moderate right pleural effusion largely fissural
has increased since [**9-17**]. Small left pleural effusion is
unchanged. Right middle lobe is atelectatic, and moderate
cardiac silhouette has increased in size, and there is greater
pulmonary vascularity, but no edema. Transvenous right atrial
and ventricular pacer leads are unchanged in their respective
positions. As before, the dialysis catheter ends in the right
atrium. No pneumothorax. There is no good evidence for
pneumonia.
.
[**2148-12-8**] CXR: There is interval development of new bibasilar
opacities consistent with newly developed aspiration given the
short interval. Asymmetric pulmonary edema would be another
possibility although less likely. The patient is rotated.
Within the limitations of the differences in the position of the
patient, no change in pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is unchanged.
.
[**12-30**] Shoulder X-ray:
FINDINGS: Central venous access catheter incompletely evaluated.
Dual-lead
pacemaker present. The visualized left lung and ribs are
unremarkable. Joint
space narrowing of the AC joint. No dislocation. Again seen is
the proximal
left humerus fracture of the surgical neck, which extends into
the humeral
head, including the greater tuberosity. There is no significant
change in
healing or alignment. No new fractures.
  IMPRESSION: No interval change in left proximal humerus
fracture, as above.

.
[**2148-12-10**] CT Chest w/Contrast:
1. No evidence of hemothorax.
2. Multifocal acute consolidation, most likely bacterial in
nature.
3. Associated mild pulmonary edema.

Brief Hospital Course:
65yo male with DM, ESRD on HD, CHF EF 35%, tachy/brady syndrome
s/p PPM placement, afib on coumadin, CVA w/left sided weakness
who presented s/p fall, was found to have comminuted humerus
fracture, and with hospital course complicated with persistent
hypotension.
.
#. Comminuted Left Humerus Fracture: Patient initially presented
s/p mechanical fall, and was found to have left humerus
fracture. Patient seen by ortho, who do not plan to surgically
intervene at this time.  They reccommended conservative
(non-operative) management at this time such as sling and pain
control. Patient also seen by acute pain service, for additional
recommendations regarding pain control.  Patient will need to
wear arm in sling/collar, and follow-up with ortho for
re-evaluation, he should schedule this appointment in early-mid
[**Month (only) 404**]. Had follow up X-ray of his fracture shortly before
discharge which showed no change. His pain was controlled with
oxycontin 20mg [**Hospital1 **], tramadol PRN and dilaudid 2-4mg prn. He
usually required only 2-4mg dilaudid a day.
**Team asked patient and rehab to coordinate the follow up appt
with Ortho within 1 month of discharge (mid [**Month (only) 404**]).
.
#. Hypotension: Patient's initial hypotension requiring MICU
admission felt to be due to sepsis, likely secondary to
multifocal pneumonia (HCAP) given CT chest findings. Was on
vancomycin and cefepime for empiric coverage of HCAP, completed
8 day course on [**12-15**]. He then persisted to have hyptension
averaging 70-90 every day and occasionally dropping to 55. He
was afebrile, mentat
