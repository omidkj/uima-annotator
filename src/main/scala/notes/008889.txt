Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2597**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute exacerbation of Left flank/back pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
64M well-known to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], w/ multiple medical issues who
has a known 5.5 cm AAA, last seen in clinic on [**3-25**] (at which
time was an increase by 4 mm since [**2201-7-27**]), now presents from
[**Hospital6 8972**] with acute exacerbation of lower back
pain and left flank pain.  The patient has chronic lower back
pain (s/p lumbar spinal fusion) but this is an exacerbation at
rest and the patient states that this pain is markedly different
from his chronic back pain. The patient denies nausea/vomiting,
dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, or loss of
consciousness. He had a L CEA on [**2201-8-18**], was readmitted POD4
for neck hematoma and troponin leak.  He is also s/p CABGx4 [**2199**]
but he has been stable from a cardiac standpoint since then.
There was a concern for AAA leak/rupture however, CTA abd/pel at
the OSH did not demonstrate any evidence for leak/rupture.  He
was treated for his HTN but was stable overall and he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and treatment.

PSH:

graft to D1)
- spinal stenosis s/p total laminectomy at L4 and discectomy
L4-L5 on [**2198-3-30**], s/p partial vertebrectomy of L4 and L5 and
fusion L4-S1 on [**2198-11-12**], s/p revision laminectomy of L4,
total laminectomy of L5, and fusion L4-S1 on [**2198-11-13**].

Social History:
Lives in [**Location (un) 8973**] with family.  The patient is a retired
police officer (retired in [**2192**]).  Tobacco smoking: half a pack
per day starting at age 15, smoking up to two packs per day,
currently on Chantix.  Former heavy alcohol use between [**2159**] and
[**2192**]. Currently, he drinks one drink per week.  No other drug
usage.


Family History:
Father died of an intracranial hemorrhage at the age of 35.
Paternal grandparents both had strokes. Maternal grandfather had
an AAA. Maternal grandmother had diabetes.  A daughter has
breast cancer.  Another daughter is healthy.  Five grandsons are
healthy.

IMAGING:
CTA abd/pel w/ recons [**2202-4-2**]:
1. Extensive atherosclerotic disease involving the thoracic and
abdominal aorta with calcified and noncalcified plaque
formation. Soft tissue penetrating ulcers in the thoracic aorta
are stable. No evidence of active abdominal aortic aneurysm
rupture.

2. Interval increase in the size of the abdominal aortic
aneurysm, now measuring 5.6 cm, previously measured 5.0 cm.

3. Extensive branch vessel narrowing and stenosis, including
SMA.

4. Centrilobular emphysema and borderline enlargement of the
mediastinal lymph nodes, unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was transferred from [**Hospital6 8972**] for
exacerbation of L flank/back pain in the setting of known
enlarging AAA.  Inital concern for AAA leak/rupture but CTA
there did not demonstrate any evidence of an acute process.

On arrival, patient was admitted to the CVICU and was
aggressively treated with IV/PO antihypertensives to control his
BP (goal of SBP<120) and a repeat CTA abd/pel with
reconstructions was performed.  This demonstrated: extensive
atherosclerotic disease involving the thoracic and abdominal
aorta with calcified and noncalcified plaque formation, stable
appearance of penetrating ulcers in thoracic aorta without
evidence of active AAA rupture but interval increase in size to
5.6 cm from 5.0cm.

He was treated with hydration/bicarb/mucomyst for renal
protection after the dye loads from the CTA.  His pain was
controlled with IV/PO narcotics and his symptoms progressively
improved.

His imaging was extensively reviewed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the
entire [**Last Name (STitle) 1106**] service and the decision was made to continue
only conservative management given that the risks of operative
intervention greatly outweighed the potential benefits,
especially in the current setting where his symptoms were
improving and his was clinically stable.  This was discussed
with the patient and his family.

The patient was eventually titrated off IV medications and was
stabilized with only PO medications.  He was restarted on a
regular cardiac diet on HD 3 and continued to void well.  His
creatinine was elevated from his baseline of 2.0 to 2.5 on HD4
but repeat Cr was 2.6. On HOD#5 his Creatinine was 2.7 and he
will follow-up with blood pressure and creatinine checks with
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] (neprhologist). He has an outpatient
appointment later this week.

He was discharged to home in stable condition with new
adjustments in his PO anti-hypertensive medications and was
instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] next week.
