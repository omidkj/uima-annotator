Service:  MEDICINE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76 year old
male recently discharged to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2192-3-13**], after an
admission to [**Hospital1 69**] for a
pneumonia, rib fracture and moderate right pneumothorax.  The
patient developed Clostridium difficile colitis and was
treated with Flagyl at [**Hospital1 **].  As part of a work-up, the
patient had an x-ray of the abdomen which revealed a
distended bladder and a Foley catheter was placed.

The patient saw a urologist on the day of admission, and had
Foley catheter replaced.  The patient subsequently developed
significant bleeding around the meatus and came to the
Emergency Room for an evaluation.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On review of systems, he noted recent
increased fatigue, and was reported feeling feverish.

In the Emergency Department, the patient had a temperature of
103.4 F., systolic blood pressure of 50; heart rate of 144;
and O2 saturation of 99% on room air.  The patient was given
four liters of intravenous fluids and was started on Levophed
with an increase in the systolic blood pressure to 90.

Urinalysis was positive and the patient was given Gentamicin
and ceftriaxone.  The patient received a total of 13 liters
of fluids to maintain blood pressure with decrease in O2
saturations to 85% with central cyanosis.  Arterial blood gas
revealed 7.21/31/51 and the patient was intubated for hypoxic
respiratory failure and uncompensated metabolic acidosis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Torticollis since early [**2170**].
2.  Congenital left club hand.
3.  Arthritis.
4.  Non-Q wave myocardial infarction in 02/[**2192**].
5.  Clostridium difficile colitis in [**2-/2192**], with negative
cultures times two.
6.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Benztropine 1 mg p.o. twice a day.
2.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
4.  Albuterol MDI.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with wife and has one son.
History of alcohol dependence and tobacco use with a 50 pack
year history.  Denies history of intravenous drug use.

LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count 17.0,
hematocrit 29.9, INR 1.6; creatinine 1.6, CO2 21, lactate
1.8.

A urinalysis with small blood, positive nitrites, protein 30,
21 to 50 white blood cells, many bacteria.

Arterial blood gas on six liters nasal cannula, 7.21/33/57.

Chest x-ray with florid congestive heart failure.

EKG normal sinus rhythm at 100; unchanged from [**2192-3-5**].
Poor R wave progression, low voltage.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature 102.7 F.;
pulse 98; blood pressure 96/55 on Levophed at 8.  O2 100% on
100% non-rebreather.  Intakes and outputs 13 liters in, 200
cc out.  In general, the patient is intubated.  HEENT:
Pupils equally round and reactive to light.  Respiratory:
Bilateral crackles and rhonchi.  Cardiovascular:  Regular
rate; no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen distended with
decreased bowel sounds.  Extremities with no cyanosis,
clubbing or edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 76 year old male who
presents to the Emergency Room with urosepsis after recent
Foley catheter manipulation and was intubated for hypoxic
respiratory arrest.  The patient was hypotensive with
systolic blood pressure in the 50s in the Emergency Room and
received 13 liters of intravenous fluid resuscitation.  The
patient developed florid congestive heart failure and
subsequent hypoxemia.  The patient was maintained on pressors
for blood pressure support.

The patient's blood cultures subsequently grew Klebsiella
pneumonia, resistant to Gentamicin.  An Infectious Disease
consultation was placed and the patient was started on
Meropenem.

The patient developed congestive heart failure in the setting
of intravenous fluid resuscitation.  In addition, the patient
developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on hospital day
number three.  An echocardiogram was obtained which revealed
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis and severely
depressed left ventricular systolic function.  The Levophed
was discontinued and the patient was maintained on
vasopressin for a blood pressure support with conversion to
normal sinus rhythm.

As the patient's sedation was weaned, mental status did not
improve, and head CT scan was obtained which revealed
development of a moderate amount of interventricular
hemorrhage.  A subsequent MRI revealed fluid levels in the
occipital horns of both lateral ventricles and increased
signal within the pre-pontine cistern, worrisome for
additional focus of subacute subarachnoid hemorrhage.

A Neurological consultation was placed at the time.  Interval
blood cultures from catheter tip grew Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus.  Neurology felt that the MRI findings
were consistent with possible infectious emboli.

Transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained which revealed
small mobile echogenic mass on the non-coronary cusp of the
aortic valve suspicious for vegetation.

A repeat head CT scan and subsequent follow-up head CT scan
showed no change in interventricular hemorrhage.

Subsequently a family meeting took place and given no
improvement in mental status over several days off sedation,
it was decided to make the patient comfort measures only.
The patient was started on a morphine drip and subsequently
expired on [**2192-5-10**], at 06:00 p.m.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Urosepsis.
2.  Endocarditis.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Atrial fibrillation.
