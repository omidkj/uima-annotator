Nadir HCT ([**2118-2-10**]): 21

ERCP ([**2118-2-10**]): Evidence of a previous sphincterotomy was noted
in the major papilla. Erythema was noted at the apex of the
sphincterotomy.
A small amount of oozing blood was noted on the upper aspect of
the sphincterotomy, at approximately 2 oclock. [**Hospital1 **]-CAP
electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Upper GI bleeding with acute blood loss anemia. Transferred
from OSH after 2 episodes of melena status post sphincterotomy
at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2-7**]. After initially stable HCT, dropped to 21 on
[**2118-2-10**] prompting repeat ERCP. This showed a small amount of
oozing blood on the upper aspect of the sphincterotomy site;
[**Hospital1 **]-CAP electrocautery was applied for hemostasis successfully.
.
In total, 4 units of pRBC were transfused.
.
Post-procedure he had severe abdominal pain with concern for
performation. Plain radiographs were read as possibly having a
very small amount of free air. CT abdomen was reassuring as no
air was seen.
- contin Amoxicillin-Clavulanic Acid 500 mg PO/NG Q12H for 7 day
course given concern for possible microperforation. D1=[**2-13**].
.
2. ESRD. Noted to have inadequate dialysis during initial
sessions. Underwent AV fistulagram with 2 areas peripheral
venous stenoses which were angioplastied. Pt's fistula function
improved on HD.
- due for HD [**2118-2-16**] (Wed)
.
3. Hypertension. Antihypertensive medications held initially
given his acute bleeding.
- continue Amlodipine 10 mg PO/NG DAILY
Currently holding clonidine 0.2 mg [**Hospital1 **], diovan 80 mg [**Hospital1 **],
atenolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **], lisinopril 40 mg daily, lasix 80 [**Hospital1 **]
In discussion with Nephrology, expect pt's BP control will
improve as he contin to receive more effective HD, thus will not
resume additional BP Rx for now.
