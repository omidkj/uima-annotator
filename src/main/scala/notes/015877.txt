Ciprofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
referred for right renal artery stenting and coronary
angiography

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Renal artery stenting
Cardiac catheterization with BMS placed in LAD, two overlapping
BMS's placed in proximal LCX


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 22627**] is an 80 year old woman with a history of aortic
stenosis s/p mechanical AVR [**8-4**], atrial fibrillation s/p
cardioversion, HTN, GERD, and PVD who presented [**2202-4-25**] for
elective coronary and renal angiogram complicated by pna and [**Last Name (un) **]
and is transferred to the CCU s/p cath for hemodynamic
monitoring.
.
The patient was referred for renal angiogram after a recent
hospitalization for claudication work up that revealed bilateral
superior femoral artery disease and right renal artery stenosis
>95%. She was referred for coronary angiogram after having an
"abnormal EKG" at Dr.[**Name (NI) 9654**] office. Of note, she has been
having episodes of chest burning for the last 2 months described
as "heartburn" that occurs primarily at rest and often when
laying in bed after a late night snack. This pain lasts 30 min
and is intermittently and inconsistently associated with
bilateral arm and jaw pain, and always self-resolves without
intervention.
.
The patient was admitted for pre-cath hydration given her Cr of
1.8. She initially complained of epigastric tightness radiating
to her chest and EKG showed no acute ST changes.

Pertinent Results:
REPORTS:

ECHO CARDIAC CATH [**2202-4-26**]:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated two
vessel CAD. The LMCA was patent. The LAD had a proximal 50%
stenosis.
The LCx had a 90% stenosis in the mid vessel. The RCA was known
to be
totally occluded and was not engaged.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic
arterial
systolic hypertension with an SBP of 162 mmHg.
3. Renal artery angiography demonstrated a recanalized total
occlusion
of the right renal artery.
4- Successful revasculrrization of a chronically occluded
(recanalized)
right renal artery, stented with a 5.0x18 mm Genesis Aviator
stent with
excellent result.
5- Return for LCX intervention on Thursday after hydration
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel CAD.
2. Moderate systemic hypertension
3. Successful stenting of right renal artery with Aviator stent.

4. Return to cath lab for LCX intervention on Thursday [**2202-4-29**]
after
hydration

CXR AP [**2202-4-27**]:
IMPRESSION: New left mid lung opacity, concerning for pneumonia.
Right lower lobe atelectasis and bilateral effusions. Recommend
followup radiograph in 4 weeks following treatment to assess for
resolution.

CARDIAC CATH [**2202-5-3**]:
COMMENTS:
1- [**Name (NI) 50257**] PTCA and stenting of the proximal LCX with two
overlapping (3.0x8 and 3.0x12 mm) Vision BMSs with excellent
results
(see PTCA Comments)
2- Unsuccessful attempt to revascularize the OM2 CTO.
3- Staged PCI of the mid LAD (+/- re-attempt to open the OM2)
4- Limited resting hemodynamic assessment showed mildly elevated

systemic arterial hypertension (154/68 mmHg).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal LCX with two
overlapping
Vision BMSs
3. Unsuccessful attempt to revascularize the OM2 CTO
4. Staged PCI of mid LAD
5. Monitor renal function, continue with Mucomyst and hydration
(add
lasix to maintain urine output of 100 cc/hour)
6. Continue medical therapy

CARDIAC CATH [**2202-5-4**]:
1. Successful PCI of the mid LAD with a 2.5x18mm bare metal
stent.
2. Unsuccessful attempt to open the occluded OM branch.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PCI of the LAD with BMS.
3. Unsuccessful PCI of the occluded OM branch.

RENAL ARTERY U/S [**2202-5-5**]:
1. Normal-sized kidneys with no evidence of hydronephrosis.
2. A likely dilated or calyceal diverticulum in the right kidney
which
contains milk of calcium.
3. Patient was unable to breathhold due to dyspnea, and
therefore an accurate evaluation of the renal arteries could not
be performed.

CXR [**2202-5-12**]:
FINDINGS: New left PICC terminates in the lower superior vena
cava. Heart
remains enlarged, and there is bilateral asymmetrical perihilar
alveolar
pattern, which has improved on the left, but is newly developed
on the right.  This is likely related to the patient's known
multifocal pneumonia, but coexisting edema is also possible.
Moderate right pleural effusion with adjacent right retrocardiac
opacity is not substantially changed. Moderate left pleural
effusion has slightly changed in distribution but is probably
similar in overall size.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 F with HTN, mechanical AVR, A fib s/p cardioversion, PVD
admitted for coronary and renal angiogram.  Hospitalization
complicated by NSTEMI, acute renal failure, pneumonia, GI bleed,
and hyponatremia
.
#. Coronaries/NSTEMI:  Patient with non-exertional epigastric
tightness radiating to the chest, found to have 90% occluded
left circ on cardiac angio on [**2202-4-26**], but was not intervened
upon because of poor renal function.  Patient had chest pain
following renal stenting, found to have new ST depressions on
EKG and rising cardiac enzymes consistent with NSTEMI. Pt needed
cardiac cath but renal functions following renal artery stenting
was elevated.  Patient maintained on nitrodrip while renal
functions improved.  Patient was brought for cath on [**2202-5-3**],
where she
