Admission Date:  [**2136-1-20**]       Discharge Date:  [**2136-2-14**]


Service:  Neurosurgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Decreased memory and difficulty finding
words.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 70-year-old
white male, Italian speaking, who presents with complaints
that he feels he cannot remember anything; he states other
than that he feels fine.  He indicates he is comfortable with
his family translating at the time of initial visit due to
his Italian speaking language barrier.  Family indicates that
the reason he is seen was for the wife having noticed
progressive deterioration of the patient's memory.  For
example, on the day that he was seen in the outpatient clinic
he could not remember his daughters' names.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Essentially unremarkable.  The patient
denied any fevers, chills, headache, sore throat, ear pain,
earache, visual blurring, cough, shortness of breath, chest
pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or
constipation.  He further denied any dysuria, focal numbness,
weakness or rash.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery bypass graft x2
approximately one year prior to admission.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lisinopril
2.  Metoprolol
3.  Aspirin

ALLERGIES:  He had no known allergies to medications.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is married with a very supportive family.
He has a positive past history of cigarette smoking.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  Well developed, well nourished Italian speaking
white male in no acute distress.  He was alert and
appropriate at the time of his physical exam and he did
indeed exhibit memory loss both to recent and distant events.
As an example, he did not know the President's name, the
mayor of [**Location (un) **] name or his daughters' names.
VITAL SIGNS:  Heart rate 66, blood pressure 166/89,
respiratory rate 16, temperature 97.1?????? and O2 saturation was
98%.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Unremarkable.
Extraocular movements were intact.  Pupils were equal, round
and reactive to light and accommodation.
NECK:  Supple.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythmic without murmurs, rubs or
gallops.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no evidence of
wheeze, rales, rhonchi or accessory muscle use.
ABDOMEN:  Nontender, soft with no guarding, rebound or mass
appreciated.
NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.  Muscle
strength was [**4-15**] in all four extremities.  The exam was
severely limited due to fairly poor patient cooperation and
compliance with instructions.

LABORATORY DATE AT THE TIME OF INITIAL ASSESSMENT AT [**Hospital6 **] ON [**1-17**]:  Essentially within normal
limits and he was seen at the [**Hospital6 2561**] in
consultation by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 6910**] who made arrangements
for the patient to be transferred and admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital for a craniotomy on the [**1-20**].

The patient had undergone an MRI prior to transfer from the
[**Hospital3 **].  An MRI showed heterogeneously enhancing lesion
in the left posterior frontal parietal lobe with a smaller
satellite nodule at the left periatrial location abutting the
left lateral ventricle.  There was mild mass effect with
effacement of the left lateral ventricle, but no significant
midline shift.  Due to these findings and the history of
decreased memory, the patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital on the morning of [**2136-1-20**] at
which time he was taken to the operating room where, under a
general endotracheal anesthetic, the patient underwent a
craniotomy and subtotal excision of the enhancing lesion.
The patient tolerated the procedure well, went to the post
anesthesia care unit in stable condition and was subsequently
transferred to the floor the morning following surgery and
did quite well on the floor for the first several days.  A
repeat head CT scan on the [**1-24**] showed a small
amount of blood products in the area of the tumor bed and
cavity of the tumor with some mild residual ring enhancement.
However, there was no indication for further surgery.

A neuro-oncology consult was obtained on the [**1-25**]
and the patient exhibited a brief episode of unresponsiveness
with a deep drop in his blood pressure to systolics of 70s
while he was sitting on the bed pan for bowel movement.  His
oxygen saturation at the time was 91% to 94%.  He was placed
supine and quickly became more responsive with the oxygen
saturation returning to 98% to 99%.  An electrocardiogram was
done which showed T-wave inversions in lead AVL.  He was
placed on telemetry.  He otherwise did fine from this and
there were no further electrocardiogram changes.

On the 14th, he was seen in consultation by neuro-oncology
and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 724**] who recommended external beam radiotherapy.
On the morning of the 15th, the patient was noted to
initially be afebrile with vital signs stable.  He was awake,
alert and oriented x3.  He had a mild to moderate persistence
of a right hemiparesis that was first noted after surgery.
His lungs were clear, however a CTA of the chest was obtained
which did reveal a saddle embolus and therefore the
interventional radiology department was consulted and this
lead to a thrombectomy and IVC filter.  The patient tolerated
this procedure quite well, was returned to the floor that
evening in stable condition.

On the morning of the 16th, he had a brief episode of
decreased responsiveness.  A head CT was obtained, but showed
no change in the tumor bed or condition of the brain and the
patient became much more responsive later in the day and
remained stable.  He was seen in consultation in the x-ray
therapy department on the [**1-31**] for evaluation and
initial planning and measurements for planned external beam
radiotherapy to be begun in an outpatient manner.  The
patient remained hospitalized with mildly waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]
responsiveness and alertness.  However, on the [**2-6**], due to bouts of respiratory failure, the patient
was intubated urgently and readmitted to the neurosurgical
Intensive Care Unit in acute respiratory distress and after
discussion with the family, the patient was then heparinized
for prophylactic treatment to avoid further risk of deep
venous thrombosis or embolus.  He did quite well, was weaned
from the intubation within 48 hours and was transferred to
the floor on the [**2135-2-9**].

He was maintained on heparin until the [**1-16**] with
Lovenox started on the [**1-15**] to overlap for one day
and did well throughout the remainder of his hospitalization.
The patient had been given a PEG tube for tube feedings and
nutritional support prior to discharge and on the morning of
the [**1-16**], he was noted to be awake, alert, afebrile
with vital signs stable.  Pupils 3 mm, bilaterally reactive
to 2 mm.  He continued to show a right dense hemiparesis, had
a slightly wet cough but with stable O2 saturations in the
mid 90s.  He responded with dysarthric speech and again was
noted to speak only Italian, so level of appropriateness was
difficult to obtain without the presence of an interpreter.

The telemetry was discontinued on the 4th and the patient was
subsequently to be discharged to the [**Hospital3 7**]
Rehabilitation Center on the morning of the [**2136-2-14**]
with plans for follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6910**] in
the clinic in approximately three to four weeks time and
instructions for the patient and/or family to call Dr.[**Name (NI) 38469**] office for scheduling of this and also plans
were made for the patient to begin his x-ray therapy as an
outpatient at the [**Hospital1 **] Hospital with plans
for the patient and family or rehabilitation staff to call
and confirm the start date for the outpatient x-ray therapy.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Glioblastoma multiforme of brain
2.  Status post saddle emboli, status post embolectomy and
inferior vena cava filter placement.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous q 12 hours
2.  Oxacillin 1 gm intravenous q 12 hours x10 days total
which was begun on the [**2136-2-9**].
3.  He was also to take aspiri
