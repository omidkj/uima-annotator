History of Present Illness:
45 year old man with UC, status post total proctocolectomy with
ileal pouch anal anastomosis with persistent diarrhea who
presented to [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital with 4 days of loose stools,
fatigue, lightheadedness with stools turning to bloody 2 days
prior to admission ([**2100-7-26**]).  On initial evaluation at outside
hospital, he was noted to have "melanotic" stools, that turned
to hematochezia.  Admission HCT was 22. Of note, he was taking
Ibuprofen for tendinitis, though only took 10 tablets over a
period of a week.  He was transfused 2U on [**7-26**] with unclear
result of on his HCT.  On [**7-27**] he had an EGD which showed normal
esophagus, stomach and duodenum and then underwent a
Pouchoscopy/enetorscopy which showed large amount of fresh
bright blood with blold clots, including J pouch and throughout
the entire small bowel examined (~ 70cm).  Since the last scope,
he was transufsed another 5U of PRBCs and his HCT remained at
22.  He was reported to be hemodynamically "stable", BP 100/50
and HR in 120s. He has 2, 18G IVs at time of transfer.
.
On the floor, he is without of lightheadedness, but has no other
symptoms.  He denies recent changes in BM frequency or character
until presentation. No abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting,
cramping or tenesmus.  No fevers, chills, malaise or weight
loss.  Denies recent CP, but reports shortness of breath for 1
year, which comes and goes, currently reporting mild sx
intensity.  No infectious symptoms, no arthralgias or myalgias.
No rashes or skin changes.  He has been off all medications for
~ 2 years, as "nothing has worked" for his loose stools.
.
Of note, ~ 1 month ago, had severe constipation and required an
endocsopic treatment to relieve this.  Has not had bloody stools
or melanotic stools since that time.

[**2100-7-27**] : CTA abd/pelvic per IR request. IMPRESSION 1. No CT
evidence of active extravasation of contrast. 2. Most of small
bowel is collapsed, without obstruction. 3. S/p total colectomy
with a ileo-pounch creation. No evidence of surgical
complication at the anastomosis. 4. No free fluid or air.

[**2100-7-28**] : Transthoracic Echo: IMPRESSION: hyperdynamic left
ventricle with severe left ventricular outflow tract obstruction
due to systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral leaflet;
no vegetations seen
.
[**2100-7-29**] : CTA abd/pelvic per IR request IMPRESSION: 1. No
evidence of acute gastrointestinal bleed in this study. 2. Small
amount of simple free fluid in the pelvis is minimally increased
since prior study.
.
[**2100-7-27**] CXR: Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach, with the
most proximal side port just beyond the gastroesophageal
junction. The degree of rightward displacement of the mid and
lower trachea and length of trachea displaced that lies above
the aortic arch is more than I would expect from the aortic arch
alone. This raises the possibility of mass effect from adjacent
goiter or adenopathy, less likely from an esophageal lesion. I
suggest you obtain repeat conventional chest radiographs when
feasible to see if this is a persistent finding. Heart size is
top normal, and the lungs are grossly clear. There is no
appreciable pleural abnormality or indication of pneumothorax.
.
[**2100-7-29**] CXR: Tracheal contour has returned to baseline with no
evidence of mass effect.


Brief Hospital Course:
45 year old man with UC, status post total proctocolectomy with
ileal pouch anal anastomosis with persistent diarrhea who
presented to outside hospital with loose bloody stools, was
found to have hemorrhage in the small bowel with a normal EGD,
status post 7 units pRBCs and with out improvement in HCTs.  He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further intervention.
.
# Anemia.  [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]-intestinal bleed from small bowel.
Etiology unclear: may be secondary to an arteriovenous
malformation, or to a mechanical injury from previous endoscopy
(although no intermittant bleeding) or from a leaky anastamosis.
 Alternatively may be UC flare, but wouldn??????t expect involvement
of the small bowel, although there is a question of underlying
crohns.  Patient reports recent NSAID use, however not
significant amount ingested, but a bleeding ulcer was not
completely ruled out.  After recieving 7 units without adequate
Hct response at the outside hospital the patient was transfused
2 additional units of pRBCs and 2 units of FFP on arrival to the
MICU. A CT??????A on admission demonstrated no active bleeding. On
HD2 the patient began actively bleeding with several episodes of
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] bloody diarrhea ~200 ccs per episode.  2 additional pRBCs
were administered with target Hct above 30.  On HD3 after
another episode of [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] GI bleed, a repeat CT-A demonstrated
again no active bleed - 2 more units of pRBC were transfused
after a Hct drop below 30. An upper and lower endoscopy on HD 2
revealed mild duodenitis, old blood, some mild ulcerations of
small bowel and mild proctitis.  No source of bleeding was
identified.  A push through enteroscopy was performed on HD 3.
The upper GI tract was visualized to the middle of the ileum and
all appeared normal with no sign of active or prior bleed.  It
was felt the site of bleeding was either in the remaining part
of the bowel not visualized or that the site of bleeding had
healed. The patient was scheduled for an outpatient swallow
endoscopy with GI, and observed for 24 more hours for active
bleeding and Hct drops below 30.  Pt's Hct remained stable, and
on HD4, pt was discharged home with c
