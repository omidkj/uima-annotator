Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 78**]
Chief Complaint:
headaches on bending, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Removal of right frontal ventricular catheter.
2. Removal of right parietal connector and external tubing.
3. Placement of new right frontal external ventricular drain and
placement of right parietal external ventricular drain.


History of Present Illness:
56 y/o female presents to ER with cheif complaint of headaches
upon bending. She has a very compilicated history that includes
a rt temporoparietal resection in [**2128**] with the placement of a
VP shunt. She has significant left sided weakness at baseline.
She was recently seen at [**Hospital1 18**] for a UTI and was treated with
Macrobid. She denied any fever, chills, or nightsweats.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], she reports headaches that is made worse
when bending. She states this is a new symptom which was first
noticed 3 weeks ago. Her headaces are located in the posterior
occipital area. She denies any photophobia or diplopia. In ER,
patient was noted to have a Tmax of 102.1 and was given steroids
and vanc/ceftriaxone for suspected meningitis. Neurosurgery was
consulted for questionable VP shunt malfunction vs meningitis.

On Discharge:

Pertinent Results:
CT Head W/O contrast ([**4-19**])-
1. Interval increase in caliber of the ventricular system, with
suggestion of periventricular white matter low attenuation,
which could reflect
transependymal flow of CSF. This may indicate a shunt
malfunction.
2. Stable area of encephalomalacia in the right temporoparietal
and occipital
lobes.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST ([**4-21**])-
The lateral and third ventricles have increased in size compared
to
the prior study. The fourth ventricle is stable. This is
concerning for
shunt malfunction. There are two intraventricular catheters in
stable
positions. A right frontal approach catheter terminates in the
left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**], and the second right temporal approach
catheter terminates in the right lateral ventricle near the
posterior septum pellucidum.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2155-4-21**] at 4:23:21 PM
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2152-10-23**], the
mitral and aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened, but
without discrete vegetation. Mitral regurgitation severity is
similar.
If the clinical suspicion for endocarditis is moderate or
greater, a TEE is suggested to better define the valve leaflets.


CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2155-4-22**] 4:28 AM
1. Stable-appearing enlarged lateral, third and fourth
ventricles. Possible transependymal flow of CSF seen. Persistent
sulcal effacement, particularly in the right frontal lobe
suggestive of mild edema.
2. Stable post-surgical encephalomalacic changes in the right
frontal,
temporal, and parietal lobes with stable right-sided craniotomy
and
craniectomy.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2155-4-23**] 6:11 AM
Intraventricular catheters remain in place, with interval
decrease in size of the lateral and third ventricles compared to
[**2155-4-22**]. Diffuse sulcal
effacement persists.

Head CT [**5-4**]:
FINDINGS: Intraventricular shunts are unchanged in position,
including right frontal approach terminating in the left lateral
ventricle and the right parietal approach terminating near the
atrium of the right lateral ventricle. Compared to [**2155-5-1**]
study, there is no significant change in size and configuration
of the lateral or third ventricles. Moderate periventricular
white matter hypodensity is unchanged, with no evidence of
transependymal migration of CSF. Diffuse sulcal effacement is
stable in appearance. There is a large area of cystic
encephalomalacia involving right temporoparietal lobe. The
craniotomy changes and fixation hardware are again seen. There
is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or shift of normally midline
structures. With the exception of right maxillary small
mucus-retention cyst, imaged paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are well-aerated.
IMPRESSION:
1. No change in size or configuration of the lateral and third
ventricles
compared to [**2155-5-1**].
2. Unchanged diffuse sulcal effacement.
3. No hemorrhage.

Head CT [**5-7**]:
FINDINGS: There is large-volume pneumocephalus in bilateral
anterior frontal horns and in the right temporal region. There
has been interval
redistribution of pneumocephalus which may have slightly
decreased in size
compared
