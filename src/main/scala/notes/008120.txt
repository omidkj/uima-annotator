MICRO:
AFB smears x3
Sputum cx - moderate respiratory commensal flora
Influenza antigen - negative

IMAGING:
Admission CXR:
- new consolidative process left lower lobe concerning for
pneumonia.
- continued mild left ventricular enlargement.
- Trace left pleural effusion is likely present.
- Scoliosis of the thoracolumbar spine convex to the right.

CXR ([**3-29**]):
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**3-27**] and 19: Large left
pleural effusion is unchanged obscuring detail in the left
chest.  Left lower lobe is airless consistent with either
collapse or an extraordinarily exudative pneumonia filling all
the airspaces. There is probably a small right pleural effusion.
Of greater concern is the possibility of new right apical
pneumonia, a region partially obscured by some external
artifact.

CXR [**4-3**]
SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST

REASON FOR EXAM: Pneumonia and respiratory distress. Comparison
is made with prior study [**4-2**] at 2100 hours.

There has been no interval change in multifocal lung
consolidations in the
right upper lobe, left perihilar region, and bibasilar regions
worse in the left side. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. ET tube is
in standard position. NG tube is out of view below the
diaphragm. Right PICC tip is no longer visualized in the chest.
There is a catheter projecting in the right axilla.  This could
be the PICC or an object located outside the patient. Please
correlate clinically. There is no pneumothorax.

[**2133-4-3**]:
Bronchial lavage:
     NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

[**2133-3-31**]: ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2125-10-16**], findings are similar.

[**2133-3-31**] CTA OF CHEST:
1. No pulmonary embolus seen.
2. Extensive, predominantly upper lobe ground-glass
opacification progressed over the past three days while left
lower lobe pneumonia is improvin, could be
due to hemorrhage, diffuse alveolar damage (ARDS) or multifocal
infection.
3. Mildly enhancing enlarged mediastinal nodes are likely
reactive.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusion, slightly larger on the
left.
