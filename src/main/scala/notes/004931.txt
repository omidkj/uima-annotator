Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Subdural hematoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 61 year old female with history of triple valve
replacement, on Coumadin, congestive heart failure, AICD
placement and chronic kidney disease, who was transferred from
[**Hospital1 **] after being incidentally discovered to have a subdural
hematoma on CT scan. Patient reports suffering a fall in her
kitchen approximately one month ago. She denies any prodrome
with the fall and attributes the fall to tripping over her
shoelaces, which are often untied. She fell on her bottom and
then fell backwards, hitting her head on the kitchen floor. She
denies any loss of consciousness, though she recalls feeling
dazed for several minutes. She was then able to get up from the
floor without assistance and later saw her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] INR was
noted to be 2 at that time and she had no evidence of bruising
or focal neurological deficits. She denies having a CT scan
performed at that time. Since the fall, she denies any
headaches, dysarthria, arm or leg weakness until the day of
admission when she was scheduled for a cardiology appointment.
She reports having difficult grasping papers in her hand and was
also complaining of weakness in her left leg, all of which were
new. She additionally reports a frontal headache over the past
few days. Her cardiologist was concerned and referred her to the
[**Hospital1 **] ER where a head CT revealed a SDH with midline shift
which reportedly measured at 12-13mm at the maximal area. She
was additionally supratherapeutic on Coumadin with an INR of
6.8. She was given 2 units of FFP and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for urgent
neurosurgical evaluation.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, neurosurgery was consulted and a repeat CT scan
was ordered, which showed a subdural hematoma that was slightly
larger, when compared to the previous CT head at [**Hospital1 **]. She
was given 2 more units of FFP for reversal of her INR and 1 [**Location 72557**]. Cardiology was consulted and recommended not correcting
her INR if at all possible, though neurosurgery recommended
aiming for a goal INR of 1.5 to 2. Patient was then admitted to
the MICU for observation.

Upon further interviewing, the patient reports one medication
change recently - Pantoprazole was increased to [**Hospital1 **]
approximately one week ago. She denies any recent antibiotics
and has been taking her Coumadin as directed, 2 mg daily since
Friday. She does report highly variable INRs in the past and is
thus not on a standing dose of Coumadin as it is adjusted per
her INR, which is checked twice a week.

cigarettes/day, reports rare alcohol use and denies illicit drug
use. Previously worked as an aide in nursing homes and
hospitals.

Imaging:
HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2115-3-7**]: There are bilateral acute on
chronic subdural hematomas, measuring up to 10 mm, overlying
cerebral convexities and extending along the tentorium and falx.
There is 4 mm leftward shift of septum pellucidum. There is no
edema or hydrocephalus. Basal cisterns are patent. Surrounding
soft tissues and osseous structures are unremarkable. Imaged
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.
Comparison is made with outside CT performed earlier today.
Acute subdural collection overlying left cerebral convexity is
slightly larger compared to the prior study. The extent of
midline shift is similar.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2115-3-8**] 7:48 AM:  Bilateral acute on
chronic subdural hematomas overlying both cerebral convexities
and extending along the tentorium and the falx are unchanged.
Shift of normally midline structures towards the left is also
unchanged, measuring up to 6 mm. The basal cisterns are
preserved. There is no hydrocephalus and the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. A hypodensity in the left frontal
subcortical white matter likely represents a lacune. Vascular
calcifications are again noted in the vertebral and cavernous
carotid arteries. There is slight decreased pneumatization of
the right frontal sinus and the right mastoid air cells; the
remaining visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
well aerated. The osseous and soft tissue structures including
the orbits are unremarkable.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2115-3-8**] 11:06 AM:  No previous images. The
cardiac silhouette is enlarged in a patient with extensive
sternal sutures and pacemaker device in place. Some evidence of
elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Opacification at the left
base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm could reflect a combination
of atelectasis and pleural effusion.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2115-3-8**]: The left atrium is dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. A
bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present. The transaortic
gradient is higher than expected for this type of prosthesis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. A bileaflet mitral valve
prosthesis is present. The mitral prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. A mechanical tricuspid valve prosthesis is present.
The tricuspid prosthesi
