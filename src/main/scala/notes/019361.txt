Micro:
[**11-30**] Pleural tissue: sparse growth of staph aureus
Otherwise no growth in blood, urine, and pericardial specimens.

Imaging:
[**2195-11-25**] CXR IMPRESSION: Interval significant enlargement of now
large left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.
Underlying consolidation not excluded. Persistent small right
pleural effusion.

[**2195-11-26**] RUQ ultrasound: 1. Dilated common bile duct with no
stone or obstructing mass identified.  Mild central intrahepatic
biliary dilatation also seen. An MRCP could be performed for
further characterization.
2. Increased echogenicity of the kidneys is suggestive of
diffuse renal
parenchymal disease. 3. Bilateral pleural effusions.

[**2195-11-28**] MRCP: 1. Mild central intrahepatic and CBD dilatation,
similar to prior ultrasound, without evidence of filling defects
or extraluminal mass lesion. 2. Status post cholecystectomy. 3.
Bilateral moderate pleural effusions and trace ascites.

[**2195-11-30**] Pleural pathology: 1.  Left pleural debris (A-B):
Neutrophilic aggregates with fibri
