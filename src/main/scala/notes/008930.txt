CXR [**2128-1-13**]
STUDY: PA and lateral chest.

COMPARISON: [**2128-1-11**].

FINDINGS:

The left pleural effusion has essentially resolved. The right
pleural effusion is unchanged in size and appearance, remaining
small. There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis, as before with
slightly shallower inspiration on the current study. No new
pulmonary opacities. Heart size and mediastinal contour are
unchanged. The sternal wires remain intact. No suspicious bone
lesions.

IMPRESSION:
Resolved left pleural effusion with persistent small right
pleural effusion.

Echo [**1-5**]
MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: 1.0 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm)

Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 1.0 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 5.2 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm)
Left Ventricle - Systolic Dimension: 3.7 cm
Left Ventricle - Fractional Shortening: 0.29 (nl >= 0.29)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 55% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Ascending: 3.4 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal
interatrial septum. No
ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size.
Overall normal
LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal
calcifications in
aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter. Focal
calcifications in
ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma in
aortic arch.
Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. No AS. Mild (1+) AR.


MITRAL VALVE: Partial mitral leaflet flail. Mild mitral annular
calcification.
No MS. [**Name13 (STitle) 650**] (4+) MR. Eccentric MR jet.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Significant PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results
were personally
post-bypass
data

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:
1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. There is partial mitral leaflet flail of the P2 scallop.
Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is
eccentric.
7. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.

POST-BYPASS: Pt is being paced
1. A mitral annuloplasty ring is seen well seated. Trace MR is
seen. Mean
gradient is around 3 mm of Hg. No [**Male First Name (un) **] is seen.
2. Biventricular systolic function is preserved.
3. Aorta is intact post decannulation
4. Other findings are unchanged



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1182**] was a same day admit and on [**2128-1-5**] he was brought
directly to the operating room where he underwent a mitral valve
repair. Please see surgical report for details. Following
surgery he was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring in
stable condition. Later on op day he was weaned from sedation,
awoke neurologically intact and was then extubated. On post-op
day one he was started on beta blockers and diuretics. He was
gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight. On this day he was
transferred to the telemetry floor. Later on this day he began
to have some confusion and agitation which required an observer
and restraints. He was then transferred back to the CSRU on
post-op day two d/t agitation (most likely d/t ETOH w/d) and
remained in unit for monitoring and treatment of agitation.
Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per
protocol. He remained in the CSRU until post-op day four when he
was transferred back to the telemetry floor. By post-op day five
his mental status seemed to improve and was more pleasant and
cooperative. Physical therapy followed patient for strength and
mobility during post-op course. Over the next several days
patient remained compliant and mostly A&O x 3 with occasional
incidences of confusion. He did require a observer on/off until
post-op day eight. He was ready for discharge to rehab on
post-op day ten. With plan for [**Hospital **] rehab after recovered
from cardiac surgery.
