pulmonary embolus

none


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 42 y.o. female with unremarkable PMH who was
transferred from [**Location (un) 745**]-[**Location (un) 3678**] for pulmonary embolus. Patient
injured left ankle 2 yrs ago and went for elective surgery on
[**2119-12-11**] to have hardware removed d/t swelling and discomfort
(not infected). After the procedure she was not placed on
anticoagulation but was able to ambulate with crutches, playing
with her kids. 3 days PTA she had right sided shoulder pain and
pain in lateral aspect of right ribs under arm, radiating around
to back, worse with deep inspiration. She took motrin and used
hot compresses x 2 days with no relief. This a.m. she awoke with
SOB and continued chest pain and went to PCP who found elevated
D-dimer to 4000. At NWH she had a CTA which showed large
pulmonary embolus (per report saddle PE). She was
hemodynamically stable, started on heparin, and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for possible lysis.

.
Eccho: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular
wall motion is normal. Tissue velocity imaging demonstrates an
E/e' <8
suggesting a normal left ventricular filling pressure (<12mmHg).
Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Preserved global and regional biventricular systolic
function.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
LENI: no DVT in either LE
.
CXR: Right sided pleural effusion
.
EKG: S1Q3T3 present. NSR. NL axis and intervals. Good R-wave
progression. No ST changes. Q in III, inverted T in III, S in I.

Brief Hospital Course:
At [**Hospital1 18**] the patient was tachycardic to low 100's with
temperature of 101 and RR 25, BP 160/100, sating 100% on RA. She
appeared visibly uncomfortable in ED and CTA was reviewed with
[**Hospital1 18**] radiologist who noted a large right sided PE with
infarction of part of the right lung and associated pleural
effusion, as well as several small left sided emboli (NO saddle
embolus). Patient denied calf pain and LENI's were negative. The
patient was maintained on heparin, given percocet for pain, and
transferred to the ICU for close monitoring. Upon arrival to the
ICU she was comfortable and her pain was [**7-22**], down from [**10-22**]
upon presentation (percocet moderately helpful), and she was
minimally SOB.
.
She was admitted to the MICU and started on heparin GTT and
transitioned to lovenox 80 SQ [**Hospital1 **] as a bridge and was started on
5mg coumadin therapy. An ecchocardiogram showed mild PA systolic
hypertension and no RV strain. On the day of transfer she
complains of persistant pleuritic chest pain for which she has
been taking percocet 5 q 6 hrs. She did have some mild dyspnea
and required 1.5L n/c oxygen in the MICU.  She was transferred
to the floor and did well on room air.  She was started on
morphine sulfate-SR 15mg [**Hospital1 **] for pleuritic chest pain.  She is
discharged with an INR of 1.2 on [**Hospital1 **] lovenox (80mg [**Hospital1 **]) and
coumadin 5mg daily.  She has follow-up for INR check in 2 days
and will see her PCP next week.  I spoke with her PCP regarding
her hospital course and probable indication for a
hyper-coagulability work-up.  Ms [**Known lastname 70334**] will receive at least
6 mos of anticoagulation and potentially longer pending the
results of this workup.
