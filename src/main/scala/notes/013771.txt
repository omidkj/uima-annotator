History of Present Illness:
66 yo male history of COPD, Crohn's on Remicade/Imuran, and
multiple admissions for PNA who presents from Interventional
[**Hospital **] Clinic with increasing SOB and hemoptysis over the past
week. He was in his usual state of health until [**5-23**], when
he fell on his bathroom floor and fractured multiple ribs on his
left side. In [**2102-6-14**], he reports a left sided pneumonia
treated initially with moxifloxacin, and then by a double course
of levofloxacin. He has felt SOB since [**Month (only) **], and has noticed
hemoptysis with thicker mucous production since [**Month (only) 216**]. It
initially was very small amounts of dark blood. Ht has since
progressed to 1/2-1 tsp at a time 10-12 times per day now bright
red. He has also noticed thick sputum mixed with blood. He was
referred to Pulmonary at [**Hospital3 **] where a CT scan was done
in [**2102-8-14**]. He reports there was something at the left base
(LLL GGO) and follow up was requested with Pulm there in one
month. He had another CT scan in [**2102-9-14**] which revealed
similar findings.
.
He reports worsening SOB, DOE, and hemoptysis since [**Holiday 1451**]
at which point his daughter in law referred him to [**Hospital1 18**]. He had
his first IP consult today and was unable to get to it requiring
assitance and a wheelchair. He states his O2 sat was low 80s on
Room Air. He reports some air hungery, but denies fevers,
chills, weight loss, and chest pain. He reports worsening DOE,
now unable to climb one flight of stairs. He notes that he is
only coughing to get up a thick bought of mucous.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 98.8 102 144/92 16 93% 4L. Labs
including CBC, Chem7, trop, and BNP were obtained. EKG, CXR, and
CT chest were obtained. He was given one dose of Levofloxacin
750mg IV and admitted to the floor.
.
Currently, he reports being nervous. He denies SOB and reports
decreased coughing now that the oxygen is in place. He has had
no further sputum production or hemoptysis since the ED.

Imaging:
CXR: [**2102-12-27**]
Cardiac size is top normal. There is no pneumothorax or pleural
effusion.
Diffuse bilateral lung opacities have minimally improved in the
right upper lobe. There are no other interval changes.

CTA chest: [**2102-12-26**]
Interval progression of diffuse ground-glass and reticular
opacities and reactive mediastinal lymph nodes. This may
represent diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage superimposed on
emphysema, drug reaction, or atypical infection. Interstitial
lung disease (such as NSIP), although associated with ankylosing
spondylitis, is considered less likely given the rapid
progression since 9/[**2102**].

Brief Hospital Course:
66 yo male with history of COPD and Crohn's disease on
immunomodulators who presented with SOB and hemoptysis, found to
be hypoxic with PCP on bronchoscopy.

ACTIVE MEDICAL PROBLEMS:

1. hemoptysis/ dyspnea: Patient presented with hemoptysis x [**2-16**]
months with diffuse ground glass opacities and mediastinal
lymphadenopathy on CT scan.  Symptoms were most likely secondary
to PCP pneumonia as identified on BAL.   In addition, patient
had evidence of a superimposed GNR pneumonia identified as
fluroquinolone- resistent e.coli.  He also has significant
underlying lung disease with severe COPD which likely
contributes to hypoxemia.  Differential diagnosis also includes
interstitial lung disease (associated with crohns disease or
medications) or malignancy.  Limited rheumatologic evaluation
showed positive [**Doctor First Name **], negative ANCA and normal complement levels.
Hemoptysis almost completely resolved after bronchoscopy and
initiation of bactrim/ prednisone.  Dyspnea improved with
antibiotics, steriods, nebulizers around the clock and
supplemental oxygen.  At time of discharge, patient required
continuous oxygen with significant desaturation to low 90% with
ambulation.  Of note, patient may require long term supplemental
oxygen for underlyi
