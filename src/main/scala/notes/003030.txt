[**72**]. multiple surgeries: appendectomy, cholecystectomy (ex lap),

partial hysterectomy

Social History:
She quit smoking 23 years ago - she started at age 13 with 1
pack per day and then increased to 2-3 packs per day until she
quit.  She denies alcohol.  She lives at home with a [**Doctor Last Name **]

independantly.

Her brother had a stroke at age 65.  There is a family history
of diabetes, hypertension, and Multiple sclerosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 62 year-old female who presented with dyspnea on
exertion and lower extremity edema who was found to have saddle
pulmonary emboli.
.
1. Pulmonary emboli: Her CTA was notable for a saddle embolus
involving the right and left main pulmonary arteries extending
to the middle and lower lobes bilaterally with an obstruction
index of about 50%.  She was started on heparin as a bridge to
Coumadin.  Her Coumadin dose was increased until a therapeutic
level was achieved.  This is her second pulmonary emboli and
therefore she will likely need anticoagulation for life.  She
will need a hypercoagulable work-up as an outpatient.  She was
discharged on 7.5 mg daily of Coumadin.
.
2. Hematomas: While on anticoagulation, she developed 2
hematomas in her left flank and left groin.  She had no evidence
of compartment syndrome.  Her pain was controlled with Tylenol
and oxycodone.  She did require red cell transfusions for blood
loss anemia.
.
3. Hypotension: Early on during this admission, she developed
hypotension to 85/41.  Her blood pressure responded to a fluid
challenge.  An EKG had no signs of ischemia and a echocardiogram
had no sign of right ventricular dysfunction.  Her hematocrit at
that time was stable and there was no sign of acute bleed.  She
appeared intravascularly dry with an low Fe Urea.  Therefore,
her hypotension was attributed to overdiuresis.  Her blood
pressure improved with hydration.
.
4. Lower extremity edema: On admission, she had increased lower
extremity edema above her baseline.  There was no evidence of
heart failure on echocardiogram.  She was initially overdiuresed
resulting in hypotension, as above.  Once her blood pressure had
stabilized, she was restarted on her outpatient Lasix dose with
decrease in lower extremity edema.  She appeared to be
overdiuresed on her previous outpatient dose of Lasix;
therefore, she was discharged on a lower dose (20 mg daily).
.
5. Urinary tract infection: She was noted to have cloudy urine
and a urine culture was positive for klebsiella.  She was
treated with a 7-day course of ceftriaxone.
.
6. Diabetes: She had been on 36 units of Lantus as an
outpatient.  Her sugars were under poor control (A1c = 9.3), so
her Lantus was increased to 42 units.  This regimen yielded good
glucose control.
.
7. Obstructive sleep apnea: She was maintained on CPAP at night.

.
8. Right toe ulcer: She had been seen by [**Doctor Last Name **] for
debridement of her ulcer. She was maintained on wet-to-dry
saline dressing changes daily.
.
9. Back pain: She was maintained on her outpatient gabapentin
and baclofen.
.
10. FEN: Low sodium cardiac diabetic diet. She had hyperkalemia
on admission that was treated.  She had no further episodes of
hyperkalemia.
.
11. Prophylaxis: Anticoagulation with heparin/Coumadin,
Colace/senna, PPI, ambulation.
.
12. Access: Peripheral IV
.
13. FULL CODE
.
14. DISPO: She was discharged to home once she was therapeutic
on Coumadin for 48 hours.  She will follow-up in clinic 4 days
post-discharge for an INR and hematocrit check.
