Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
65 y/o female with metastatic breast cancer who was admitted to
the oncology service with cough, SOB, and hypoxia. Hypoxic to
80% on RA at NH -> in ambulance improved to 100% on NRB. She had
been c/o weakness for the past several weeks along with
worsening back pain. She has had a nonproductive cough 3 days
PTA. She has had intermittent nausea and some abdominal pain,
but no vomiting. She denies any burning when she urinates but
does note that her R nephrostomy tube has been painful and the
urine in it has been bloodier. She denies any swelling in her
legs, PND, or orthopnea. She denies any recent bruising,
bleeding, or skin changes.

In the ED, VS on arrival were T 102.2, BP 142/86, HR 113, and
sats were 80% on RA, improving to 95% on 5LNC. CXR was initially
read as pneumonia of the RML and she was given cefepime 2gm IV
x1 and levofloxacin 750mg IV x1. However, [**First Name3 (LF) **] said her CXR
did not show evidence of pneumonia so she was sent for CTA which
was concerning for atypical pneumonia. Given her ongoing
dexamethasone taper, she was given bactrim 350 mg IV x 1 for
PCP.

On the floor, she was treated for PCP pneumonia vs. HAP. She was
given cefepime, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and bactrim +
steroids.  ID was consulted and agreed with the above
management.

On the floor, in the PM [**2121-1-5**], the patient triggered for
hypoxia with an oxygen saturation of 90% on a NRB. She was also
SOB. She is currently being treated for pneumonia, possible PCP
pneumonia vs. HAP. She is on broad-spectrum ABx including
Bactrim + steroids for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was also found to be hypotensive
earlier in the evening with SBPs in the 80s which also resulted
in a trigger. She was given a 500 mL IVF bolus and her SBP
improved to the 100s. Her code status was confirmed with the
patient and her family, DNR/DNI. She was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for possible non-invasive ventilation and closer hemodynamic
monitoring.

Past Medical History:
1. Breast cancer - dx [**2112**] by chest MRI, s/p left mastectomy -
ER+, her2/neu +, [**7-29**] LN +, treated initially w/ adriamycin,
cytoxan, developed bone mets in [**2114**], treated w/ xeloda, then
herceptin + gemcitabine, then herceptin + paclitaxel, brain mets
dx [**4-26**] -> s/p WBXRT, 2000cGy, completed in [**5-26**], also underwent
XRT to thoracic and lumbar mets, XRT to pelvic mets in [**8-26**],
pelvic involvement -> hydronehprosis -> [**Date Range **] nephrostomy
tubes, had also been receiving herceptin, vinblastine, and
[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] mets recurred in [**10-27**] -> s/p 5 treatments w/
Cyberknife in [**11-26**] for recurrence; also on seizure medication
currently, chemotherapy changed to Tykerb and Xeloda [**2120-12-25**]
2. HTN
3. GERD
4. Cataracts s/p surgery

EKG [**2121-1-4**]: sinus tach, rate 113, normal axis, normal
intervals, Q wave in III, flattened T waves in III, aVF, but no
other ST or TW changes (unchanged from priors)

CXR [**2121-1-4**]: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
Pulmonary
vascularity is unremarkable. Linear atelectasis is noted at the
mid-to-lower lung zones bilaterally. Multiple sclerotic lesions
involving the ribs and vertebral bodies are consistent with
known osseous metastases. Pigtail catheters again overlies the
left and right upper quadrants. IMPRESSION: Aside from
atelectasis, no evidence of an acute cardiopulmonary process.

CTA [**2121-1-4**]:
1. Multiple scattered nodular and linear ground-glass opacities
within a predominantly peripheral distribution, new compared to
study performed less than one month prior. Diagnostic
considerations include an atypical infection; however, other
etiologies such as drug reaction, eosinophilic pneumonia, or
cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) should also be
considered.
2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism

Brief Hospital Course:
65yo F w/ widely metastatic breast cancer, on dexamethasone
taper for brain metastases, and w/ bilat nephrostomy p/w SOB and
fever w/ likely PNA +/- UTI.

Given symptoms of fever, nonproductive cough, hypoxia, and CTA
findings of new nodular and linear ground glass opacities,
initially treated for pneumonia. Given her recent history of
long hospitalizations and recent NH stay, will treat for
health-care acquired pneumonia with cefepime, levaquin, and
vancomycin. She was also presumably started on IV bactrim in the
ER for ? of PCP (given that she was on dexamethasone) and new
ground-glass opacities on CT, LDH elevated from baseline.

Upon transfer to the ICU, the patient refused positive pressure
ventilation, stating that she just wanted to be comfortable.

After discussing the matter with her and the health care team,
the patient was made comfort measures only.

Antibiotics were discontinued and she was put on a morphine gtt
to treat her sense of dyspnea.  She expired at 4:50am on [**1-7**]
with her family at the bedside.
