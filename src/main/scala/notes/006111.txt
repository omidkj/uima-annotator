History of Present Illness:
27 year old male with Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] Syndrome, chronic trach with
restrictive lung disease and COPD, multiple episodes of PNA, and
recent osteomyelitis who presents after being found unresponsive
at home.

He was found by his grandmother at home today unresponsive with
labored breathing.  He was put on his ventilator by his
grandparents and they called EMS.  Was reportedly hypoxic, pale,
with agonal respirations.

He was taken to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] ED where initial vitals were
93.7 105 23 [**12/2092**] 99%on ambu bag.  Then got hypotensive to
70/37.  He was given Duonebs, hydrocort 100mg IV, ceftriaxone 1g
IVPB, Vancomycin 1g IV, Metronidazole 500mg IV, Ativan x 2 and
started on a dopamine drip.  Also given 3L IVF.

He has had multiple recent admissions to [**Hospital1 18**]. [**Date range (1) 20550**] he was
admitted with for right olecranon osteomyelitis.  He was treated
with Vancomycin.  He was then readmitted [**9-20**] with SOB and had
enterococcal (VRE) and coag negative staph bacteremia.  Echo
revealed no vegetation.  Vancomycin was changed to daptomycin.
He was admitted again [**10-10**] with worsening right elbow pain and
evaluated by ortho who decided against debridement and he was
continued on his previous course of antibiotics.

He was seen in [**Hospital **] clinic [**10-28**] where his right elbow ulceration
was felt to improve.  He completed 6 weeks of daptomycin therapy
on [**2129-11-3**] and he was transitioned to oral linezolid [**11-5**] with
plans for 2 additional weeks (still currently taking) of
antibiotic therapy.  His PICC line was removed [**11-7**].  He called
[**Hospital **] clinic [**11-8**] complaining of arm numbness and tingling since
starting Linezolid that was felt to likely be neuropathy from
linezolid.  It was decided to observe the patient off
antibiotics given his clinical improvement.

Imaging:

ECG [**2129-11-9**]: Sinus tachycardia. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since
the previous tracing of [**2129-9-21**] early precordial T wave
inversions are new. Clinical correlation is suggested.

CXR [**2129-11-9**]: Tracheostomy tube is at the midline, approximately
4 cm above the carina. The right central venous line tip is at
the cavoatrial junction. No change in the appearance of the
chest has been demonstrated since [**2129-10-10**] in this
patient with severe scoliosis and extensive known deformity of
the thorax.

Right elbow Xray [**2129-11-9**]: Two views of the right elbow were
obtained. There is marked soft tissue swelling surrounding the
olecranon process, suggestive of bursitis. Small areas of
subcutaneous emphysema are identified. There is subtle cortical
irregularity and periostitis involving the olecranon process,
suggestive of osteomyelitis. No acute fractures are identified.
Diffuse osteopenia is unchanged. Peripheral line catheter
projects over anterior arm. 1. Radiologic findings consistent
with bursitis and likely osteomyelitis as described above.
Assessment with MRI may be considered, if clinically warranted.
2. No acute fractures.

CT chest [**2129-11-9**]: 1. New bilateral lower lobe consolidation
concerning for infection. 2. Evidence of air-trapping and
chronic atelectasis in the upper lobes. 3. Suggestion of anemia.
4. Borderline enlarged lymph nodes, unchanged. 5. Central line
terminating in the proximal right atrium.

Brief Hospital Course:
27 year old male with Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] Syndrome, chronic trach with
restrictive lung disease and COPD, multiple episodes of PNA, and
recent osteomyelitis who presented after being found
unresponsive at home with hypotension and symptoms consistent
with septic shock.

#. Septic Shock: Was hypotensive on admission due to sepsis.  It
was felt that his sepsis was likely due to pneumonia given his
bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.  Worsened osteomyelitis was
also considered, as his right elbow xrays continued to show
findings consistent with osteo, but it was felt that his elbow
was clinically improved from previous.  He was given one dose of
daptomycin on admission for possible worsening of his
osteomyelitis.  He was then started on vancomycin and meropenem
for treatment of pneumonia and he clinically improved.  The ID
consult team followed him while he was hospitalized.  He was
briefly on Levophed for BP support but was weaned off within 24
hours.  UA and culture as well as blood cultures remained
negative.  A right sided subclavian central venous line was
placed on admission, and replaced with a PICC line. Total course
of Vancomycin and Meropenem will be 14 days (day 1 [**11-9**]). He
will follow up with infectious disease as an outpatient.

#. Respiratory Failure: He required an increased amount of
ventilatory support while in the hospital felt to be due to
pneumonia.  He was also continued on his home prednisone. Prior
to discharge, patient was not requiring ventilatory support
during the day.

#. Depression: His home bupropion was held given recent his
linezolid use.  He was continued on lorazepam at night.

#. Anemia: Hct remained at recent baseline.

#. Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] Syndrome:  His pain medications were held on
admission due to his mental status but he was gradually
restarted on his home methadone, gabapentin, and baclofen.  He
was intermittently sleepy after receiving his pain medications
during his hospitalization, but he was resistant to changes in
dosing.  This should be readdressed in the oupatient setting if
possible.
