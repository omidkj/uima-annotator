Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1452**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2133-3-21**] from OSH s/s C1-2
fusion on [**3-19**] for malunion type 2 dens fracture [**Month/Year (2) 18095**] in
[**2132-12-1**]. She was at NEBH for Fusion and she was
comatose post surgery. A CT scan demonstrated cerebellar
infarcts and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further care. She was
initially in the ICU as she was comatose, intubated and with
signs concerning for tectal pressure. Per the ICU course she was
extubated on [**3-24**] at [**Hospital1 18**], re-intubated on [**3-24**] secondary to
respiratory distress, and ultimately extubated on [**3-25**]. A chest
x-ray on [**3-26**] indicated increased bibasilar atelectasis and
bilateral pleural effusions.
She was transferred to the stroke Neuromed floor for further
care on [**2133-3-30**]. She was started on ciprofloxacin per sputum
culture and sensitivity (GNR's) and will continue this until
[**2133-4-13**].
On the Neuromed floor she was on diltiazem drip for a-fib rate
control and she was started on PPN. She had a PEG tube placed
and the diltiazem gtt was weaned off and PO dilt was started.
This produced good rate control.
She also developed auto diuresis, renal was consulted and
suggested that it was SIADH and recommended lowering the amount
of free water. Heparin gtt was switched to Lovenox 1mg/kg Q12hrs
for the Coumadin bridge and with the IV drips off her free water
PEG flushes were decreased.
On [**2133-4-3**] Supplemental salt was initiated. She will need her
lytes (sodium) measured at least Q48hrs and if less then 125
will need to come back to [**Hospital1 18**] for further fluid management.
Renal's thoughts are that she may have developed a reset central
osmostat.
Ortho recommended a flexion/ extension XR of the C-Spine before
going to a soft collar but was not obtained prior to discharge.
There is an Ortho appointment set up in the coming weeks.
Fosamax was not restarted at this hospitalization.

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay with us.

You were admitted as a transfer after being found comatose
following a spinal surgery. You had a history of atrial fib. and
were off your coumadin during the surgery. You had a CT scan
that demonstrated strokes involving the cerebellum. You did not
have an MRI scan to look for other strokes but it is likely that
you had strokes in other areas during this episode. You were
evaluated by neurosurgery but no intervention by them was done.
You were restarted on anticoagulation in order to prevent future
strokes. You also had developed a pneumonia and you were started
on an antibiotic for this. You were placed on medication in
order to control your heart rate, and you had a G-tube placed
for nutrition. Other issues that arose were something called
SIADH. This was managed by decreasing the amount of fluids that
you were getting and your sodium level should be checked every 2
days to ensure that it does not go below 125. You will need to
follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 29336**] in order to get your C-collar off (see
below).

Followup Instructions:
Neurology Appointment: Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. Date/Time: [**6-16**] at
3:30 pm
Please call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 7394**] one week before to ensure time and
location.

You have a follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 29336**] in Orthopedics
