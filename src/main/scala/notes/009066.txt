Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was taken to the OR.  After sternotomy, his aorta was noted
to be heavily calcified.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] then discussed the
high risk nature of the operation with the family; they
indicated that he should proceed with the operation.  A CABG
(LIMA -> LAD), AVR, MV annuloplasty, and PFO were performed.
Upon rewarming of the heart, the LV failed to contract.  An
additional CABG (SVG -> OM) was performed.  Pt again failed to
wean from bypass.  The aorta was reopened, and the AVR was
confirmed to be well-seated with good flow through the coronary
ostia.  Family was notified; BiVAD was agreed to be futile.  Pt
was decannulated and closed.  He expired at 4:23pm.
