Brief Hospital Course:
16 yo female with known type 1 DM who was initially admitted to
the MICU for DKA, precipitated by improper use of her insulin
pump. She was started on an insulin gtt in the ED and within 3
hours the gap had closed. In the MICU, her insulin pump was held
and insulin gtt was continued initially. When her glucose was <
250 and the patient was tolerating po, she was given NPH and the
gtt was d/ced. The next morning, the [**Hospital **] clinic was consulted
for management of her insulin pump. Social Work was also asked
to come talk to the patient given that she expressed feeling
depressed and waiting help. The patient had no active SI and
appeared motivated to get help, both medically and
psychologically. She also appeared to have a good relationship
with her mother, who was almost nearly at the patient's bedside.
[**Known firstname **] recently established care with a psychologist, and
wished to continue that therapeutic relationship. She was called
out to the medical floor on hospital day 2. Her time on the
floor was uneventful. The day of discharge, she did have a
morning low glucose which was asymptomatic. The [**Last Name (un) **] consult
team made further adjustments to the insulin pump prior to the
patient's discharge. She will be following up with the [**Last Name (un) **].
