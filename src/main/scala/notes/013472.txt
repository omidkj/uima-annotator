Brief Hospital Course:
On [**5-24**] the patient was taken to the OR and had a R
hemicolectomy, end-ileostomy and G tube placement. She was taken
to the TSICU post operatively for resuscitation as she was
intubated with a pressor requirement. On POD 1, her pressors
were weaned off and her vent settings were weaned to PS. On POD
2, the patient was extubated and she was started on a steroid
taper. She remained stable in the TSICU so she was transferred
to the floor.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor she was evaluated by
the Pulmonary service to assess the need for long term steroid
treatment.  They recommended weaning her steroids quickly as she
was not on them long term and that would also help in wound
healing.  Other than vigorous pulmonary toilet including chest
PT and incentive spirometry she will follow up with them as an
out patient for PFT's and further assessment of her COPD.

As her bowel function returned, her diet was gradually advanced
slowly and she tolerated it well.  Her G tube remained clamped.
She did have daily drainage around the tube notable for dark
brown/black fluid which was odorless.  There was no pain or
induration around the tube and her WBC was normal. This will be
followed closely.  Her surgical wound had surrounding ecchymosis
but no drainage and retention sutures remained in place.

A PICC line was placed as she had poor venous access and
required a 10 day course of antibiotics as she was perforated
with a WBC of 30K on admission.  Her vancomycin and Zosyn will
end on [**2124-6-3**].  Her last Vanco trough was 12.3 on [**2124-5-31**].

The ostomy nurse saw her on a regular basis for ostomy care and
teaching along with her daughters.  She still needs instruction
and hopefully as she becomes more mobile she'll be better able
to do the care.

Due to her size, COPD and deconditioned state, the Physical
Therapy service recommended a short term rehab prior to
returning home and she was discharged on [**2124-6-1**].
