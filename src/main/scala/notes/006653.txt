[**2105-6-23**] ABDOMEN ULTRASOUND
HISTORY: Increasing abdominal girth and history of heavy
drinking, evaluate
for ascites.

FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates slightly coarsened echotexture.
Within the
left lobe of the liver, there are multiple hepatic cysts, the
largest
measuring approximately 2.1 x 1.6 x 2.9 cm, which may contain a
septation.
There is normal hepatopetal flow in a patent portal vein. The
common bile
duct measures 3 mm. The gallbladder is collapsed. Within the
upper pole of
the right kidney, there is a small cyst measuring 1.3 x 1.1 x
1.3 cm which
contains a thin septation. The right kidney measures 9.4 cm. The
aorta is of normal caliber throughout. The spleen measures 10.3
cm. The left kidney
measures 10.4 cm. There is no evidence of ascites.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of ascites.
2. Hepatic cysts.
3. Right renal cyst with a thin septation as described above.


Brief Hospital Course:
This 72 year-old gentleman with a history of Stage III CKD
likely from hypertension presented with relative hypotension,
tachycardia, dyspnea, fever, an elevated lactate, and a history
of 4 days of cough, fever and malaise.

In the ED, intial VS ([**6-21**]): Tm 104.9 BP 104/65 (b/l is
l20-130s/80s) HR 138 RR 20 O2 96% on RA. ED labs were notable
for lactate 2.7, Cr. 3.0 (b/l is 1.7), WBC 12.7. A portable CXR
found a RUL PNA. He was given Acetaminophen 1 gm po x 1,
Levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1, Ceftriaxone 1 gm IV x 1. In the ICU
his antibiotics were continued, plus fluids, and patient
improved: His anion gap closed, he became hemodynamically stable
and he was admitted to the medicine floor.

This was a severe pneumonia which required ICU management and
presented as sepsis with tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension,
fever and elevated lactate levels. It was likely a
community-acquired pathogen, and unlikely to be pseudomonal.
With his improvement, the Ceftriaxone was stopped but he was
continued on a renally-adjusted dose of Levofloxacin for 5 days.
Blood and urine cultures were sent but grew nothing. His
acute-on-chronic renal failure resolved with hydration.

The patient endorsed a liter-per-day alcohol abuse habit, with
his last drink 6 days prior to admission. He was thus watched
closely for withdrawal symptoms, given MVIs, folate, thiamine,
and had a social work consult for alcohol abuse. Because he
subjectively felt his abdomen to be bloated, and objectively
seemed to have ascites, he was examined by abdominal ultrasound,
which found no ascites, and cysts in the liver and kidney. On
followup phone conversation with the ultrasonographers these
were described as incidental findings of no particular
significance requiring a workup at this time.
