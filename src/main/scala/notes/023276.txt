History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 29807**] is a 73 year old woman with a history of
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p bare metal stent [**2175**],
presenting with symptoms of acute heart failure.
.
Ms [**Known lastname 29807**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] the morning of admission ([**2183-8-29**]) at 3 am with
profound shortness of breath, a sensation of fluid in her lungs,
a desire to cough but an inability to do so, and the feeling
that "I thought I was a goner." She pressed a panic button in
her home which set off an alarm that alerted police; she was
ultimately brought by ambulance to an outside hospital where she
was evaluated further; and then was brought by [**Location (un) **]
helicopter to [**Hospital1 18**] for concern for STEMI.
.
In the OSH she had lab values notable for a BNP of 449. CK of
333, CK-MB 4.3; Troponin-I was <0.04; 2nd set CK 331, CK-MB 9.7,
Troponin I 2.01. She received Lasix 20 mg IV, lopressor 5 mg IV
x1, nitro drip 13 mcg, Mg replacement 1 gm IV, lovenox 40 mg,
aggrastat 4 mcg, ativan 1 mg x1; as well as many of her home
meds: protonix, indur, and fosamax were held, but asa,
lisinopril, allopurinol, plaquenil, plavix, atenolol.
.
The day prior to this episode, she woke up and "could hear
myself wheezing" but had no trouble breathing and proceeded on
with the rest of her day including working at a senior center.
.
Two or three weeks ago, her primary care physician became
concerned about Ms [**Known lastname 29808**] renal function and high potassium.
The PCP recommended that Ms [**Known lastname 29807**] go off lasix; avoid bananas,
oranges and other K-containing food; and drink lots of water.
Accordingly Ms [**Known lastname 29807**] bought bottled water and drank [**1-26**] 16 oz
bottles of water each day (roughly 1.4-1.9 liters/day). Her PCP
planned [**Name Initial (PRE) **] renal ultrasound for Ms [**Known lastname 29807**] but Ms [**Known lastname 29807**] was
concerned about the cost she would incur for this so this was
deferred in favor of future bloodwork, scheduled for next week.
The K was originally detected in follow-up for a question of
bacterial or fungal cellulitis on her foot. At her PCP's
recommendation, she has since been using a "steroid-type" cream,
she says, which has solved the problem.

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.
She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

1)CAD s/p silent myocardial infarction in [**2175**]
2)s/p L CEA in [**2175**]

Social History:
Social history is significant for a 50 pack year smoking
history; she quit in [**2175**]. There is no history of alcohol abuse.


Family History:
Family history is notable for a mother, died at 72 of "heart
problems", was diabetic; father, in his mid-60s fell off a
ladder and died of ruptured aorta. Brother died of cancer (she
is not sure what kind); he had CHF and a 4-vessel CABG prior; he
died at age 67. 2 sons, age 50, 46, one with high cholesterol.

change compared with prior several EKGs from OSH.

[**2183-8-29**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. Bibasilar opacities, compatible with small layering pleural
effusions and associated atelectasis on the left.
2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.

[**2183-9-2**] ECHO TTE - The left atrium is normal in size. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal inferior aneurysm
and inferolateral akinesis. The apical lateral wall may be
hypokinetic but is not fully visualized. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**11-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

NOTE: Addendum re apical lateral wall added on [**2183-9-2**].

[**2183-9-3**] RIGHT FEMORAL VASCULAR ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and
Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right groin puncture site demonstrate a
3.9 x 4.1 x 2.0 cm hypoechoic ovoid structure seen lateral to
the vascular sheath that demonstrates contiguity with the right
common femoral artery. There is internal swirling color flow
within this structure consistent with a pseudoaneurysm. The neck
of the aneurysm, where it meets the common femoral artery
measures 3 mm in diameter.

Also noted are mixed arterial and venous waveforms within the
right common femoral artery and common femoral vein suggesting
the presence of an AV fistula.

IMPRESSION:
1. Right groin pseudoaneurysm measuring 4 x 4 x 2 cm with 3-mm
neck joining the right common femoral artery.
2. Mixed waveforms within the right common femoral artery and
vein suggesting AV fistula.

[**2183-9-3**] Cardiac Catheterization
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

demonstrated a moderate LMCA disease.  The LMCA had a 60% distal
lesion
with moderate calcification.  The LAD was patent with a patent
previously placed proximal stent.  The LCx was a moderately
calcified
non-dominant vessel and was patent.  The RCA was occluded at its
origin
and distal flow was supplied via left to right collaterals.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left and right sided
filling
pressures wi
