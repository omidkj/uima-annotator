Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Iodine; Iodine Containing / Erythromycin Base

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3507**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
83 yo F with DM type I, CHF, asthma, HTN, and CAD transfered
from an OSH via [**Location (un) **] after an acute episode of SOB and
hypoxia (O2 sats in the 50's) at her NH.  She was speaking in 1
word sentences.
.
At the OSH, CXR and exam were c/w CHF and BNP was 2270.  Lasix
20 mg IV was given twice with 100cc of urine output each time.
Nitropaste 1 inch placed.  Pt placed on BiPAP and a nitro gtt
was started.  In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED her CXR revealed CHF with
?bilateral infilrates.  She had a leukocytosis (WBC 15 with 86%
Neutrophils).  Low grade temp of 100.0.  She was given one dose
of Ceftriaxone.  Nitro drip was continued at a low dose as her
BP was well controlled (goal SBP 120-140).  She was continued on
BiPAP (ABG 7.38/49/264/30).  Lactate 1.5.  O2 sats 100%.  She
received Morphine 2mg x1 for anxiety and HA.  Her first trop was
elevated at 0.17 (CK and MB negative) which was felt to be
secondary to demand ischemia and renal insufficiency per cards
fellow.  Blood and urine cultures were sent.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU the pt was on 2L NC with sats of 96% and
breathing comfortably. Pt notes over the past few weeks she has
had a cough with white sputum and a low grade temp of 99.0  Her
doctor at the nursing home thought this was asthma and then
worsening CHF.  Her lasix was recently changed from 20 PO BID to
20 in the AM and 40 at night.

.
CXR:  PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The study is slightly
limited secondary to positioning. There are bilateral pleural
effusions. The cardiac size is within normal limits. There is
extensive calcification of the aortic arch and descending aorta.
There is mild prominence of the pulmonary vasculature consistent
with interstitial edema. Additionally, there are areas of
increased opacity in the left mid and lower lung zones and the
right lower lung zone. No pneumothorax is seen. The osseous
structures appear osteopenic.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pleural effusions and increased interstitial
markings consistent with interstitial edema.
2. Areas of increased opacity in the left mid and lower lung
zones and right lower lung zone may represent areas of
asymmetric edema, though atelectasis, consolidation, or
aspiration are also considerations.
.
Echo
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are  normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal.
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe mitral  annular calcification. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
.
Renal U/S:
1. Markedly limited exam due to patient's inability to
cooperate. No evidence of stones, large mass, or hydronephrosis.
2. 7.7 cm cystic structure anterior and superior to the upper
pole of the left kidney, incompletely characterized by this
limited study. CT scan may help clarify the origin of the cystic
structure anterior to the left kidney.
.
CT Abdomen
CT ABDOMEN: Bilateral pleural effusions and associated
atelectasis. Calcification of the mitral annulus. Borderline
cardiomegaly. Small nodule in the subcutaneous anterior chest
wall likely representing a sebaceous cyst (2:4) measuring 11 mm.
.
The cystic structure seen on ultrasound measures 7.0 x 6.3 cm
and is located in the retroperitoneal region in the left upper
quadrant. It contacts the pancreas, tip of the spleen, and
kidney, but is not definitely arising from any of them. It
appears to have simple characteristics, although appears to have
a 1-2 mm wall. Additionally, a 1-cm cyst in the body of the
pancreas (2:28) which is incompletely characterized in this
study.
.
In the lower pole of the left kidney, there are two exophytic
areas best seen in the coronal images. One of them measures 2.0
cm and has fluid density likely representing a cyst. The other
located more laterally measures 1.6 cm but is hyperdense with
measuring 45 Hounsfield units (image 313D:37). Although this
could represent a hyperdense cyst, was incompletely
characterized in this study. With the limitations of this
non-contrast study, the adrenal glands, gallbladder, and liver
are unremarkable. The aorta and both renal arteries are
inferiorly calcified. There is edema of the subcutaneous
tissues, but no ascites in the abdomen. No retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy.
.
CT PELVIS: Patient is status post left hip prosthesis placement
(probably bipolar prosthesis) which limits the visualization of
the pelvis due to artifact. There is a large amount of fecal
material within the cecum, ascending and transverse colons
likely related to constipation.
.
CT Head:
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial mass lesion, hydrocephalus,
brain edema, or hemorrhage. No minor or major vascular
territorial infarct is apparent. The density values of the brain
parenchyma are within normal limits. Surrounding osseous
structures are unremarkable aside from exostosis of right
parietal bone. There is some mucosal thickening in the ethmoid
and frontal sinuses. There are calcifications in the distal
vertebral arteries.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  83 yo F with DM type I, CHF, asthma, HTN, and CAD admitted
with acute SOB and hypoxia (O2 sats in the 50's) secondary to a
CHF exacerbation and PNA.  Hospital course, by Problem:
.
#  Respiratory Distress: Multifactorial including component of
PNA, CHF, and asthma.
.
A- Pneumonia:  The patient presented with a persistent cough,
elevated WBC, O2 requirement ranging from 2L NC to FiO2 0.4 and
low grade fevers on admission.  A consolidation was seen on
x-ray in combination with likely volume overload from CHF.  She
was initially started on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin.  Cefepime
was added when the patient's respiratory status worsened for
concern of a resistant pneumonia but this was discontinued as
the patient began to improve.  She comp
