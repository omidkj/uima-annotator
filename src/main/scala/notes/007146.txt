"Trach fell out"

History of Present Illness:
65 yo male with CAD s/p cardiac arrest and ?vocal cord
dysfunction who presented to [**Hospital3 **] from his nursing
home after he accidentally knocked his trach out and they were
unable to replace it. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ENT
replacement of the trach as they were unsuccesful at [**Hospital1 **]. He
has had the trach for any between 7 to 17 months, and has
reportedly not been on a vent in greater than 4 months. It is
unclear why it is still in but the patient states that it was
due to come out next week anyways. He initially complained of
cough with mucus production in the ED but denies it currently.
He has noted some increasing DOE and swelling of his LE
recently. He also states that he has put on weight and feels
"heavy" but is unclear on how much over how long. Denies fever,
chills, rash, or dysuria. Denies abdominal pain, chest pain, or
pleuritic pain. Denies orthopnea or PND.
.
In ED, T 96.6 BP 160/74 HR 110 O2sat 93-94% on 28% Venti mask.
Received levaquin for possible pneumonia (elevated WBC count,
productive cough). Seen by general surgery who felt that he did
not need the trach replaced as he seemed to be fine without it.

.
On presentation to medicine floor, reports trach was placed [**8-9**]
months ago emergently. Since that time has experienced lower
extremity swelling. Reports mild SOB. Denies fever, cough, chest
pain. Reports unsteady gait.
.
ROS: Negative for fevers, chills, nightsweats, chest pain,
shortness of breath, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, melena, hematochezia, hematemesis, dysuria. No
HA/dizziness/paresthesias or weakness

HEENT: Tracheostomy dressed; clean, dry, nonerythematous; EOMI;
oropharynx nonerythematous
NECK: No JVD appreciated
CV: RRR, normal S1S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops
PULM: Normal work of breathing; decreased breath sounds; CTA
bilaterally; no wheezes, rales, rhonchi
ABD: Normoactive bowel sounds; obese; soft, nontender, not
distended
EXT: 1+ bilateral LE edema; radial pulses 2+

Pertinent Results:
CXR PA/Lat ([**2185-9-26**]): Gross cardiomegaly with prominence of
pulmonary vasculature suggestive of pulmonary venous
hypertension without evidence of frank cardiac failure.

CTA Chest ([**2185-9-27**]): 1. Limited study, no main or lobar PE. 2. 5
mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule, in absence of risk
factors, dedicated chest CT is recommended for followup at 12
months.

Brief Hospital Course:
65M with tracheostomy since [**4-9**] placed for vocal cord
dysfunction following intubation for respiratory and ?cardiac
arrest transferred [**2185-9-26**] from outside hospital after trach
tube accidently fell out.

On arrival to emergency department, patient was satting 93-94%
on 28% Venti mask. hypoxia was thought to be secondary to poor
air movement due to vocal cord dysfunction and loss of trach.
Per patient's ENT doctor (Pieter Nordzig at [**Hospital1 2177**]), trach was
placed in [**4-9**] for vocal dysfunction following intubation for
respiratory failure. Respiratory failure was thought to be
secondary to obesity hypoventilation syndrome and OSA. Per ENT
attending, patient keeps trach open at night, closed during day
time. Plan was to have trach removed in [**3-6**] weeks as patient was
improving.

Surgery was consulted in ED; it is unclear regarding their
evaluation of the patient, and trach was not replaced. Given
lower extremity edema and mildly elevated BNP, patient was also
given furosemide 80mg IV x1. Given concern for PE, CTA was done
and found to be without PE. Treated for pneumonia in ED and
continued on floor given productive cough and leukocytosis. No
clear infiltrate on radiograph.  Pt also developed a diffuse
reticular erythematous and pruritic rash on all 4 extremities,
abd, and chest.  It was thought that the Levaquin may have been
contributing to rash, in addition, there no infiltrate on CXR to
treat, so it was stopped in the ICU.  The rash did improve
following discontinuation.

On morning preceding transfer to ICU, patient desaturated to 70s
while sleeping and was difficult to arouse. Trigger was called.
Patient was placed on nasal cannula 3-4L and moved to chair; O2
saturation quickly improved. Blood gas was drawn and showed
acidosis with severe CO2 retention. Repeat blood gas was similar
but with worsening PCO2 and RR of 40. Patient was intubated and
transferred to the MICU.  Trach was replaced in OR the next day
([**2185-9-29**]). Patient was gradually weaned of the vent. And prior
to discharge, he was off of the ventilator for 48 hours and only
required supplemental oxygen intermittently via a trach collar.


## Leukocytosis: Unclear source. [**Month (only) 116**] be related to a possible
pneumonia, which was transiently treated with levofloxacin
(started [**2185-9-26**]) however patient developed a rash and the
levoquin was stopped. UA normal. Urine and blood cultures with
no growth thus far.  Sputum only grew OP flora.  Started
empirically on Flagyl but 2 c.diff toxins were neg.  Flagyl
discontinued prior to discharge.

## Hyponatremia: On presentation, serum sodium was 127. Clinical
scenario most consistent with hypervolemic hyponatremia. UNa 87
and FeNa 0.5%, indicating prerenal physiology. On floor,
furosemide dose was decreased to 40mg daily. On transfer to
MICU, hyponatremia was resolving and resolved eventually.

## CAD: Two negative sets of cardiac enzymes. While NPO, d/c'ed
all heart meds while NPO.  Pt developed tachycardia thought to
be [**3-5**] beta blocker withdrawal and thus restarted IV beta
blocker.  Once able to take po, transitioned IV bb to po and
restarted ACE and ASA.  Pt was admitted on Atenolol but was
discharged on metoprolol, equiv dose, [**3-5**] to easier titration
given tachycardia.

## Fluid overload: while in the MICU, goal net neg 1 L each day.
 Received 40mg IV lasix until transitioned to 80mg po Lasix with
goal to be net even.

## Altered mental status: Has schizophrenia at baseline but per
nursing home physician he has not been delusional.  At
discharge, he appears to be at his baseline.

## Thrombocytosis: per nursing home physician, [**Name Initial (NameIs) **]
