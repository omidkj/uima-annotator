DIAGNOSIS

Bone marrow aspirate and core biopsy:

Hypocellular bone marrow with persistent involvement with acute
myelogenous leukemia.





MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION



PERIPHERAL SMEAR

Smear quality is acceptable.  Red cells show mild
anisopoikilocytosis with rare teardrop and fragmented cells.

WBC count is markedly decreased.

Differential shows:  78% lymphocytes, 12% blasts, 10% atypical
cells.

Platelet count appears decreased; giant forms are present.

ASPIRATE SMEARS

  The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation, however, it
contains only rare hypocellular spicules almost entirely
composed of stomal cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes.  Of
scant hematopoietic elements present, a large number are
represented by blasts with morphologic features similar to those
seen at first diagnosis..
  Megakaryocytes are not seen.
  A 100-cell differential shows:  Blasts 65%, Promyelocytes 5%,
Myelocytes 1%, Bands/Neutrophils 1%, Plasma cells 4%,
Lymphocytes 24%.
CLOT SECTION AND BIOPSY SLIDES

The marrow is markedly hypocellular with eosinophil debris
consistent with recent chemotherapy.  In addition, there are
several small islands of immature appearing lymphoid cells
admixed with plasma cells.   Maturing myeloid and erythroid
elements are rare.  Megakaryocytes occur in rare clusters.
Overall, the cellularity is low and averages 20%.

SPECIAL STAINS

Iron stain is adequate for evaluation.  Iron stores are
increased.

Sideroblasts are not seen.  Ringed sideroblasts are not seen.

Previous biopsies:    [**-5/3901**]  Bone marrow for
Immunophenotyping.

DIAGNOSIS

Bone marrow aspirate and core biopsy:

Hypercellular bone marrow extensively infiltrated by acute
leukemia.  See note.

Note:  The leukemia is difficult to classify by morphologic
features alone.  While a subpopulation of cells show a
definitive myeloid differentiation including Auer rods, a second
population is composed of smaller cells with scant cytoplasm and
overall lymphoid-appearing features.  However, by flow
cytometry, the features appear uniform in that all cells express
CD117 and CD34, and lack most lymphoid markers with the
exception of extremely dim expression of CD19.



MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION



PERIPHERAL SMEAR

Peripheral smear (undated, submitted from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital
[H000885]:  Smear quality is acceptable.  Red cells show:
anisocytosis, polychromasia with fine basophilic stippling, and
tear drop forms.  Rare [**Location (un) **]-Jolly bodies seen.

Differential shows  3% segmented neutrophils, 9% monocytes, 26%
lymphocytes, 62% blasts, NRBC = 1.

Platelet count appears decreased; larger giant forms are
present.

ASPIRATE SMEARS

  The aspirate material is adequate for evaluation.  there is a
biphasic population of blasts.  Some show definite myeloid
characteristics, while others of a smaller size resemble
lymphoid cells.
  Erythroid maturation is dyspoietic with asymmetric nuclear
budding.
  Maturing myeloid and erythroid precursors are markedly
decreased.
  Megakaryocytes are present in normal numbers; abnormal forms
are not seen.
  Differential shows:  Blasts 72%, Promyelocytes 3%, Myelocytes
2%, Metamyelocytes 1%, Bands/Neutrophils 1%, Plasma cells 2%,
Lymphocytes 5%, Erythroid 11%, monos 3%.  Rare Auer rods are
noted.
  Pigment-laden macrophages are noted.
CLOT SECTION AND BIOPSY SLIDES

Cellularity of the marrow biopsy is 90%.

There is an interstitial infiltrate of immature mononuclear
cells with scant cytoplasm consistent with blasts occurring  in
sheets occupying >80% of marrow cellularity

Erythroid precursors occur in small clusters, are markedly
decreased, but show maturation.

Residual maturing myeloid forms are greatly decreased.

Megakaryocytes are present and include hypolobated forms.

Marrow clot section contains too few spicules for evaluation.

Touch prep is not submitted.



ADDITIONAL STUDIES

Chromosomes sent to Cytogenetics (see separate report).

Flow cytometry of marrow showed acute myeloid leukemia with
immature features.

Clinical:  24 y/o male. WBC 3.3.

Gross:  The specimen is received in B+ Fixative labeled with
"[**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname 16376**]" and "M05-619" and consists of a bone core biopsy
measuring up to 1.2 cm, and a single blood clot measuring up to
2.2 cm, entirely submitted into cassette coded A for
decalcification.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST

Reason: eval for progression of PNA, effusion, gallbladder
pathology
Field of view: 36 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
24 year old man with AML and PNA. now on HIDAC therapy w/ O2
requirement, RUQ pain and fever
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for progression of PNA, effusion, gallbladder pathology
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: AML and pneumonia with increasing oxygen requirement
and right upper quadrant pain and fever.

COMPARISON: CT torso dated [**2132-11-23**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired images of the chest, abdomen, and
pelvis were obtained after the administration of IV and oral
contrast.

CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: Small mediastinal and axillary
lymph nodes are unchanged. Left-sided effusion may be slightly
smaller compared to the prior study. Airways appear patent to
the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally. There is
interval improvement in left upper lobe consolidation compared
to previous study. Multiple patchy areas of consolidation in the
right upper and right lower lobe are again demonstrated. There
is possible slight interval improvement in several areas of
peripheral opacity in the right upper lobe. There is possible
slight interval worsening in the right lower lobe opacity. There
is a trace right-sided pleural effusion. Note is made of an
approximately 1.5 cm new nodular density in the right lower
lobe.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Liver, gallbladder
