evbaluated by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 171**]. TTE done. He presents today
for cardiac cath. Cardiac surgery was consulted for evaluation
of AVR/+/- Bentall.

Pertinent Results:
[**2164-4-24**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS: Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body
of the left atrium. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in
the left atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is present. A
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is
severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesis of the septum and hypokinesis of the remaining
segments. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic arch is moderately dilated. The aortic valve
is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**2-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on at
time of surgery.

POST-BYPASS: The patient is A paced. The patient is on an
epinephrine infusion. Left ventricular function appears improved
(LVEF = 40-45%). Right ventricular function is unchanged. There
is a well-seated, well-functioning bioprosthetic valve in the
aortic position. No aortic regurgitation is seen. No
paravalvular leak is seen. There is a mean gradient of 11mmHg
across the valve at a cardiac output of 4.5 L/min. Trace mitral
regurgitation is seen. The aorta is intact post-decannulation.

Sleep Consult [**2164-4-25**]
Recommend:
- Please complete overnight oximetry (off CPAP). This will allow
us to get a sense of the severity of sleep disordered breathing,
and whether CPAP at time of discharge is appropriate.
If patient requires oxygen at present while awake, would benefit
from repeat overnight oximetry off oxygen as discharge
approaches
as well.
- Should the patient desaturate repeatedly or persistently <88%,
or have witnessed apneic events, would initiate AutoSet CPAP
(range of [**6-23**] cm H20 should suffice).
- Would encourage patient to sleep in lateral position, with
head
of bed elevated, as this will optimize upper airway patency.
- Would minimize medications that can relax the upper airway and
worsen sleep disordered breathing such as benzodiazepines and
narcotics.
- Please have patient follow up with sleep clinic at time of
discharge--this will help facilitate set-up of equipment (eg
CPAP) if necessary. Sleep clinic contact is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 612**].
This is particularly important given patient's occupation as a
taxi driver and erratic sleep schedule.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13648**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2164-4-25**] for surgical
management of his aortic valve disease. He was taken directly to
the operating room where he underwent and aortic valve
replacement using a tissue valve and replacement of his
ascending aorta. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. Over the next several hours he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. Chest-tubes and cardiac pacing wires
were removed per protocol.

Respiratory: He was sucessfully extubated POD1.
Post-operatively, he was noted to have desaturations to the 80's
with slowing of his heart rate, as well as periods of
apnea.  Sleep service/Pulmonary service was consulted. Overnight
oximetry (off CPAP). The patient desaturated repeatedly to <88%
with witnessed apneic events and AutoSet CPAP(range of [**6-23**] cm
H20 should suffice) was initiated while in the SICU. Aggressive
pulmonary toilet, nebs and ambulation his oxygen requirments
improved to 93% on room air and with activity 99% 2L NC.

Cardiac; hemodynamically stable SR. Low-dose beta-blockers and
aspirin were continued. ACE was held until BP will tolerate.

GI: bowel function return. H2 blockers were continued. He
tolaterated a regular diet.

Renal: gently diuresed. Renal function normal with good urine
output. Electrolytes replete as needed.

Neuro: Pain well controlled with narcotics and NSAIDs.

Disposition: he was followed by physical therapy for strengthing
and mobility.  He was discharged to [**Hospital6 1643**] Center
on POD 6.  He will follow-up as an outpatient.
