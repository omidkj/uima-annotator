Reports:
--------
[**2111-5-9**]- head Ct- NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no acute
intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular territorial infarct.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved. The ventricles
are normal in size and configuration. The visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated.

IMPRESSION: Normal head CT.

[**2111-5-9**]- PA AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPHS OF THE CHEST: There has been
marked interval development of CHF compared to two days prior,
with moderate interstitial edema, cephalization of vasculature,
Kerley B lines, and small bilateral pleural effusions with
associated atelectasis. There is no focal consolidation. The
heart is also mildly enlarged. The osseous structures are
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Interval development of moderate CHF and small
bilateral pleural effusions. No focal consolidation.

[**2111-5-9**]- CTA chest-
CTA OF THE CHEST: There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism
within the main right and left pulmonary arteries as well as the
lobar branches. The subsegmental branches are difficult to
evaluate due to respiratory motion, however, no PE is readily
apparent. There is no aortic dissection. The heart is moderately
enlarged. There is no pericardial effusion. Small bilateral
pleural effusions are seen, with associated atelectasis. There
is moderate CHF as evidenced by diffuse septal thickening,
cephalization of the vasculature, and the small pleural
effusions. In addition, there are small scattered peripheral
areas of nodularity, tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacity, and ground-
glass which are likely due to atelectasis and alveolar edema
related to the patient's CHF. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is
prominent including a conglomerate area of lymph nodes in the
prevascular space measuring 5.9 x 1.3 cm, subcarinal lymph node
conglomerate measuring 4.4 x 2 cm, right hilar lymph node
measuring 0.8 cm. There are no pathologically enlarged axillary
lymph nodes. The visualized portion of the upper abdomen is
unremarkable.

There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.
2. Moderate CHF with cardiomegaly, extensive interstitial edema,
and small bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.
3. Prominent mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which may be reactive
to the pulmonary process, however, also raises the possibility
(in conjunction with the finding of CHF in this young patient)
of an underlying connective tissue disorder such as lupus.

FLOW CYTOMETRY REPORT

FLOW CYTOMETRY IMMUNOPHENOTYPING

The following tests (antibodies) were performed: Kappa, Lambda,
and CD antigens 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 19, 20, 45, 56.



RESULTS:

Three color gating is performed (light scatter vs. CD45) to
optimize lymphocyte yield.   Lymphocytes and monocytes comprise
approximately 55% of total analyzed events.  B cells comprise
approximately 7% of lymphoid-gated events and do not express
aberrant antigens.  T cells comprise approximately 77% of
lymphoid gated events, expressed mature lineage antigens, and
have a helper-cytotoxic ratio of 1.0 (usual range in blood
0.7-3.0).

Natural killer cells account for approximately 14% of lymphoid
gated events.



INTERPRETATION.

Non-specific T-cell dominant lymphoid profile; diagnostic
immunophenotypic features of involvement by B-cell lymphoma are
not seen in specimen.  Correlation with clinical findings and
morphology is recommended.  Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may
not detect all lymphomas due to topography, sampling or
artifacts of sample preparation.



Note: This test was performed using analyte specific reagents
(ASRs).  These ASRs have not been cleared or approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  However, the FDA has
determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary .
