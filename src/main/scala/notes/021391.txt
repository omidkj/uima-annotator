Brief Hospital Course:
#  BRADYCARDIA/INTOXICATION : Patient felt to have acute
intoxication of Nadolol which caused bradycardia. He was started
on a glucagon gtt which improved his HR and mental status.
Toxicology was consulted who felt that in the setting of renal
failure the nadolol would persist for 48 hours. His HR improved
after initial 12 hours. Psychiatry was consulted and offered him
inpatient psychiatric evaluation, which he refused.  He was
eventually discharged back on his nadolol with follow-up in a
partial day program.

#MENTAL STATUS CHANGES-Initially presumed secondary to
ingestion. CT head done [**2-7**] negative. Resolved before transfer
to floor.

#  BRONCHITIS: Unclear if patient completed treatment course
recently but no active pulmonary symptoms. Initial concern for
TB in the MICU given ETOH history and previous CT findings and
current CXR with RUL findings, however a documented PPD was
negative 2 weeks prior.  No need to r/o for TB.
.
# ACUTE RENAL FAILURE- Creatinine 2.8 (baseline 0.8); FENA 1.04;
The patient was felt to be profoundly dehydrated and after
fluids/PO intake this all improved to baseline.  Resolved on the
floor with rehydration and return of cardiac output.
.
#Elevated cardiac enzymes- Patient has bradycardia/hypotension,
EKG on arrival with new TW flattening anterolaterally; Troponin
markedly elevated in ED to 0.26 but has acute renal failure;
enzymes trended down.  They were unconcerning on the floor.
