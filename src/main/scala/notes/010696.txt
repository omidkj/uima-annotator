pattern.   Nl Axis.  No peaked T waves.

[**2133-10-27**] ECHO - The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the basal inferior wall and distal halves of the
anterior septum and anterior wall. The remaining segments are
mildly hypokinetic and overall systolic function is moderately
reduced. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral leaflets and
supporting structures are fibrotic. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 y.o. male diabetic vasculopath with [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] Tear in
[**5-26**], known unrevascularized 3VD, Ischemic CM with EF 30%, CKD
presents with hematemesis, acute renal failure and chest pain.
The patient was thought to be having a massive UGIB leading
which lead to an NSTEMI in the setting of a hct of 23.

1) GI Bleed: Likely upper GI by hematemesis and NG Lavage with
coffee grounds.   Has history of [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] Tear.  He was
seen by GI on admission who felt that this was a likely UGI
source (he subsequently had guaiac positive stools).  He
required 4 U PRBC initially (for hct nadir=23), and hct remained
stable after this.  He was hemodynamically stable throughout
MICU course.  He was maintained on a [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI and initially
had a NGT in place.  Given cardiac enzyme leak in the setting of
this demand, scope was delayed until hemodynamics stabilized.
An EGD was eventually performed and a MW tear was identified and
appeared to have recently bleed.  No cautherization was
performed.  The patients hct remained stable and he was mainted
on a [**Hospital1 **] PPI.  He was discharged after 3 days of stable hct.  He
was given specific instructions to return to the ED with an
signs of re-bleed.

2) CAD with known 3VD now w/ NSTEMI.  On ASA,
