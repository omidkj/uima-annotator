History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 yo M with COPD and stage 1 Lung Ca who
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with cough and dyspnea at rest. BIPAP was
attempted but failed, he desaturated, showed signs of fatigue,
was intubated and transfered to the ICU. He had a new LBBB on
EKG but cardiac enzymes were negative and so cardiology thought
LBBB was [**1-11**] COPD exacerbation and PNA. He was initially treated
with Ceftriaxone and Levofloxacin for PNA. He received a BAL
which revelaed to organisms but was significant for blood. ABx
regimen changed to include Vancomycin because of concern for
necrotizing PNA caused by kleb or staph. PEEP was lowered and
his LBBB resolved, cardiac markers continued to be negative.
While in ICU his Hct dropped from 35->27, guiac was negative. He
received 20mg Lasix yesterday and was negative 1L, overall
during ICU admission he was positive 2L. He has been in and out
of A.Fib with RVR into 120s which responded to IV lopressor. EKG
revealed t-wave inversions in III and aVF, but again cardiac
enzymes continued to be negative. Vancomycin course completed
but he will be on Ceftriaxone for 2 more days. Of note, patient
was extubated [**2197-6-13**], has been saturating in low 90s on RA, at
times requiring 2L NC and/or face mask. He is also being viral
screened and is on droplet precautions.

Discharge Labs: **************

Results:
[**6-17**] CXR: Bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left
are probably unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of
the patient. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Patient
is status post right upper lobectomy. There is no evident
pneumothorax. Left lower lobe opacities consistent with
pneumonia are unchanged. Opacities in the left mid lung are
worsening likely due to another focus of infection. Right lower
lobe opacity has worsened, most likely due to worsening large
area of atelectasis. Sternal wires are aligned. Patient is
status post aortic valve replacement.

but again cardiac enzymes continued to be negative.
Vancomycin/Ceftriaxone/Levofloxacin course completed
(3day/5d/5d). He was extubated [**2197-6-13**]. On the floor he was
weaned off oxygen and continuous O2 monitoring until he was mid
90s on 1L with only occasional desat with exertion.

# Respiratory failure/Hypoxia: Came to the floor S/P intubation
for increasing respiratory distress and fatigue while on Bipap.
Respiratory failure was likely [**1-11**] CAP given left
