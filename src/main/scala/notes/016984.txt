History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year-old woman with a history of gastric
DLBCL [**2158**] followed by autologous SCT [**2165**] and AML [**3-5**] secondary
MDS. She is being admitted for hypotension on day +8 after
underwent AraC/Idarubicin induction [**2169-8-30**]. She was
subsequently admitted [**Date range (2) 36123**] for febrile neutropenia
and pseudomonal sepsis. Bone marrow biopsy done at the time
demonstrated recurrence of AML, so she was enrolled in a trial
of AraC +/- clofarabine ([**Date range (1) 36125**]). She tolerated the
medication well and was discharged on day +6. She was again
admitted [**Date range (3) 36127**] with hypotension. Day 22 BM biopsy
[**2169-11-30**] showed persistant disease. She was discharged to home
with plan to follow-up in clinic.
     Since she was home, she was feeling well this past weekend.
Today her visiting nurse found her to have a temperature of 102.
She has an erythematous papular rash on her nose that she states
is not new for her and is not pruritic or painful - feels this
is irritation from tissues for runny nose. She denies any
localizing symptoms such as headache, neck pain, chest pain,
cough, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, or
dysuria.

Past Medical History:
Past Oncologic History
.
She was first diagnosed with gastric diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma in [**2158**]. She underwent partial gastrectomy, radiation
therapy, and CHOP chemotherapy. She relapsed in [**2164**] and was
found to have diffuse disease in the supraclavicular nodes and
mediastinum. She underwent R-CHOP and two cycles of RICE. She
subsequently relapsed and underwent autologous stem cell
transplant in [**4-4**].
.
After the transplant, she did well until [**2169-6-1**] when she was
admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital with symptoms consistent
with pneumonia. Her counts were significant for a white blood
count of 2.6, hematocrit 31.1, and platelet count of 23,000.
Bone marrow biopsy after resolution of the pneumonia showed
myelodysplastic syndrome with increased blasts (5-10% with
trilineage dysplasia), thought to be [**3-5**] her prior chemotherapy,
radiation therapy, and stem cell transplant.Chromosomal studies
revealed chromosome abnormalities of deletion 5, 7 and 20.
.
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was readmitted for persistent fevers on [**2169-8-4**] and
was noted to have increasing blasts in her peripheral blood. A
bone marrow biopsy on [**2169-8-14**] was consistent with increasing
blasts to 10% in the marrow. She underwent induction with
Idarubicin and Ara-C on [**2169-8-30**]. Bone marrow biopsy [**10-26**]
showed recurrence of leukemia. For this reason she elected to
enroll in the randomized trial of AraC/clofarabine.
.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. AML secondary to MDS, diagnosed in [**2169**] (see details above)
2. Gastric DLBCL (Diffuse Large B cell lymphoma) from
supraclavicular L/N in [**2158**] with relapse in [**2165**], s/p adriamycin

tx, 2 cycles of CHOP, 2 cycles of RICE tx, s/p autologous stem
cell transplant in 3/[**2165**]. Relapsed gastric lymphoma s/p partial

gastrectomy with chemotherapy.
3. GERD
4. Chronic systolic heart failure (EF 30-40%), recently
evaluated by cardiology; thought to be secondary to a previous
asymptomatic inferoposterior wall MI (distribution of injury not
consistent with cardiomyopathy secondary to anthracycline
toxicity). Had a P-Mibi for further evaluation which confirmed
moderate perfusion defect of PDA territory and medium sized,
severe perfusion defect of LAD territory as well as severe
systolic dysfunction. The decision was made to defer cardiac
catheterization until oncologic issues had been resolved.
Cardiac medications including low-dose ACEI and beta-blocker
were started. Repeat echo showed that EF was stable at 35-40%.

Social History:
The patient lives with her husband, and daughter's family. She
quit smoking 4 months ago, but had smoked for 25 years. She
denies alcohol use or drug use. She had previously worked as a
waitress. She was born in [**Country 2784**] and moved to the United States
at age 20.

Family History:
Father had heart failure and mother had diabetes.

Pertinent Results:
Chest radiograph, portable ([**2169-12-4**]): In comparison with study
of [**11-16**], allowing for the portable technique, there is little
change. Specifically, there is no evidence of acute pneumonia.

Immunophenotyping ([**2169-12-6**]): Immunophenotypic findings
consistent with peripheral blood CD34/CD33 positive myeloblasts.
 Ratio of mean fluorescent intensity of CD33 positive blast to
mean fluorescent intensity of isotype control is 3.2.

CT chest without contrast ([**2169-12-6**]): 1. Improvement of pulmonary
interstitial edema and decrease in the size of pleural effusions
from prior CT study. 2. Foci of ground-glass opacity in the left
upper lobe are stable-to-slightly improved and probably are also
part of the same process. 3. No evidence of pneumonia.

Bone marrow biopsy ([**2169-12-21**]): HYPOCELLULAR BONE MARROW WITH
EXTENSIVE FIBROSIS, MARROW REGENERATION AND INCREASED
MYELOBLASTS.  Though a significant population of maturing
erythroid and myeloid precursors are present, immature,
non-clustered cells consistent with blasts comprise at least 10%
of marrow cellularity.  By immunohistochemistry, CD34 highlights
mononuclear cells which comprise approximately 10% of the
cellularity.  The findings are consistent with marrow
regeneration with persistent involvement by acute leukemia.
CD117 and MPO stain approximately 30% of cells.  The remainder
appear to correspond to maturing erythroid precursors.

Chest radiograph, 2-view ([**2169-12-29**]): Minimal right perihilar
atelectasis. No evidence for pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo F with AML admitted with fever and neutropenia, noted to
have persistent leukemic involvement of bone marrow, who
underwent allogeneic SCT during this hospitalization. She  had a
very complicated hospital course including fever and
neutropenia, acute graft-versus-host disease, thalamic stroke,
CMV Viremia, and multiple UTIs. Patient had repeat bone marrow
biopsy on [**2170-5-8**] showing recurrent leukemia. Patient was made
DNR/DNI/CMO at that time by her health care proxy. She passed
away on [**2170-5-18**] after being hospitalized for 5 months.

#. AML: The patient was admitted on [**2169-12-4**] with fever.  She
underwent immunophenotyping on admission and was found to have
persistent AML.   The patient underwent Azacytadine/gemtuzumab
therapy from [**12-7**] to [**12-11**].  A bone marrow biopsy on [**2169-12-21**]
again showed marrow regeneration with persistent involvement by
acute leukemia.   The patient was then started on Dacogen
therapy. Another bone marror biopsy was performed on [**1-16**],
which revealed a hypocellular bone marrow and <5% blasts.  At
this time, it was decided that the patient should undergo an
allogeneic SCT.  She underwent a pre-SCT Infectious Disease
evaluation, and she increased her performance and nutritional
status.  The patient
