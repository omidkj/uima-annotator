CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY  OF  THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 81-year-old
Chinese  woman,  who presented with acute shortness of breath
this  morning.  She reported that over the last two weeks she
has had increasing dyspnea on exertion.  Her cardiologist has
had  increased her daily Lasix from 10 mg to 20 mg p.o. q.d.,
five days ago.  She awoke in the early morning hours, acutely
short  of breath.  She awoke her son immediately.  She denies
any  chest  pain  or  recent  angina.    Her son reports that
because  it  had been Chinese New Year, she may not have been
compliant with her low sodium diet.  Prior to presentation to
the  emergency  department,  the patient was acutely short of
breath.   Blood pressure systolic was 160 mmHg.  After prompt
evaluation  treatment with 100 mg of IV Lasix, and an unknown
amount  of  nitroglycerin,  her  blood  pressure  dropped  to
systolic  of  70/palpable.    Despite  this low pressure, she
remained  responsive  and  appropriate.  She denies any chest
pain,  fever,  abdominal  pain,  dysuria, or change of bowel,
recent change in bowel habits.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Mild mitral stenosis.
2.  Atrial fibrillation.
3.  Obesity.
4.  Diet controlled diabetes mellitus.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.

She  had  a  stress  ETT  MIBI  done  on  [**2113-5-9**], which is
negative for ischemia.  RV was prominent and she had an EF of
72%.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lasix 20 mg p.o.q.d.
2.  Lopressor 15 mg p.o.b.i.d.
3.  Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d.
4.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o.q.d.
5.  Coumadin dosed per INR.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL  HISTORY:    She  lives  in  her home.  She denies any
tobacco or any alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the pulse of 120,
irregularly   irregular.      Blood   pressure  78/palpation.
Respiratory  rate  16,  saturation  100%  on rebreather mask.
GENERAL:  She was obese and comfortable and in mild distress.
HEENT:   Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light.  Sclerae
were  anicteric.    Oropharynx  clear.    NECK:   Examination
revealed  JVP  to  the  jaw.    RESPIRATORY:    She had rales
posteriorly   with   expiratory   wheezes.    CARDIOVASCULAR:
irregular  irregular  with a 2/6 systolic murmur radiating to
the  axilla.  ABDOMEN:  Examination was benign.  EXTREMITIES:
Trace pedal edema with good peripheral pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data revealed the white count of
10.4,  hematocrit  42.9,  platelet count 183,000, sodium 138,
potassium   3.9,   chloride   97,  bicarbonate  23,  BUN  16,
creatinine  1.1, glucose 307, INR 3.7, ABG 7.28, pCO2 51, pO2
268   on   nonrebreather   mask.    Digoxin  level  was  0.8.
Urinalysis  revealed 0 to 2 WBCs, occasional bacteria, 300 mg
per  dl  of  proteinuria.    The EKG revealed that she was in
atrial  fibrillation with a rate of 120.  She had normal axis
and  intervals, Q-waves inferiorly.  She had evidence of left
ventricular hypertrophy.  No ST or T changes noted.

Chest x-ray revealed that she had cardiomegaly with bilateral
perihilar  opacities  consistent with severe congestive heart
failure.  She also had a left lower lobe infiltrate.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

Problem #1:  CARDIOVASCULAR:  She was started on Dopamine for
blood pressure support, which was eventually weaned off later
in  the  afternoon with stable blood pressures.  She was rule
out for cardiac event by serial cardiac enzymes.  Because she
was not rate controlled for atrial fibrillation and had a low
Digoxin  level,  her dose of Digoxin was increased from 0.125
to  0.25.    Repeat  Digoxin  level  revealed  that  she  was
therapeutic  on  her new dose.  Coumadin was also held for an
INR  of 1.3 and will need to be restarted and dose for a goal
INR  from  two  to three.  Chest x-ray was obtained revealing
that  the  patient was in mild congestive heart failure.  She
was then gently diuresed with p.r.n. Lasix.

Echocardiogram  was  obtained,  which  revealed that her left
atrium  was marked dilated as well as the right atrium.   She
had  mild  symmetrical  left  ventricular  hypertrophy with a
normal  left  ventricular  cavity size.  Her left ventricular
systolic  function was hyperdynamic with an EF of 70% to 75%.
The right ventricular inferior wall was hypertrophied and the
right  ventricular cavity was mildly dilated.  There was mild
global right ventricular free-wall hypokinesis.  There was no
significant aortic valve stenosis.  The mitral valve leaflets
were  mildly  thickened  without any evidence of mitral valve
prolapse.   There is severe mitral annular calcification with
moderate  thickening of the mitral valve chordae.  There is a
minimally  increased  gradient consistent with trivial mitral
stenosis,  mild  1+  mitral regurgitation seen.  She also had
moderate-to-severe  3+  tricuspid  regurgitation  along  with
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  Compared to
the  previous  study  on  [**10-26**],  [**2112**], multiple major
abnormalities   have  persisted  without  evidence  of  minor
change.    The  echocardiogram  was  performed.  She was then
transferred to the floor with no subsequent complications.

Problem  #2:   INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Upon being transferred to
the floor, she was found to be febrile to 102.0.  Chest x-ray
revealed  a  left  lower  lobe  infiltrate  along  with  mild
congestive  heart  failure.   She was started on Levofloxacin
for  presumed  pneumonia.    She has completed nine days of a
ten-day   course  of  Levofloxacin  upon  discharge.    Blood
cultures,  urine  cultures,  and  sputum cultures revealed no
growth final at the time of discharge.

On  the  day  of  discharge she was afebrile and had a normal
white count.

Problem #3.  PULMONARY:  She was given chest physical therapy
and  Guiafenesin to help loosen her secretions.  She was also
given  Albuterol  and  Atrovent  nebulizers,  MDI  p.r.n. for
wheezing.  Lung examination improved considerably at the time
of discharge compared to that on admission.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE   STATUS:      The   patient   was   discharged  to
rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o.q.d.day 9 of 10.
2.  Lasix 20 mg p.o.q.d.
3.  Aspirin 81 mg p.o.q.d.
4.  Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o.q.d.
5.    Combivent  MDI  one  to two puffs q.4 to 6 hours p.r.n.
wheezing.
6.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o.q.d.
7.  Coumadin doses per INR goal of 2 to 3.

DISCHARGE  INSTRUCTIONS:    The  patient  is to return to the
emergency  room,  should  she  develop worsening shortness of
breath or chest pain.

FOLLOW-UP  CARE:    She is to followup with the cardiologist,
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] in one week.
