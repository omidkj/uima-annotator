Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer for STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cath

History of Present Illness:
78yo female with multiple medical problems including type 2
diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia,
hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and AAA was
transferred from an OSH with a STEMI.
.
In [**2-15**], patient recently fell at home from "legs buckling under
her because of neuropathy" and was sent to rehab. While in
rehab, she tripped on the stairs and broke her ankle with no
subsequent surgical intervention. At rehab, she endorsed 2
separate episodes of epigastric burning over the past 2 weeks
that lasted a short amount of time and was relieved by oxygen
and vomiting. Today she had another episode which she describes
as an epigastric type burning sensation associated with nausea
and vomiting. The character of the episode was similar to the
previous episodes; however this episode lasted longer. She also
endorsed pain radiating to her back and shortness of breath.
.
Upon initial evaluation by EMS at 11:09am, her vital signs were
HR 58, BP 92/48, RR 16, and 88% on 2L. She was taken to [**Hospital 28941**] and arrived at 12:15pm. Upon arrival at [**Hospital3 **],
vital signs were BP 131/53, HR 86, RR 18, temp 98.4, and pulse
ox 100% (unclear how much supplemental O2 she received). She
received SL NG x 1, ASA 325mg PO x 1, nitro gtt at 10mcg,
dilaudid .5mg IV x 1, plavix 660mg PO x 1, and heparin drip. ECG
at the OSH demonstrated STE in II, III, and avF with reciprocal
STD in I, avL, V1, and V2.
.
She was med flighted to [**Hospital1 18**] where she was transferred to the
cath lab and received aspirin 325mg PO, heparin bolus,
integrelin, and potassium. She was found to have a subtotal
occlusion in the mid left circumflex for which she received a
bare metal stent.
.
Of note, she was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2151-3-15**] for a cardiac
catheterization and she was found to have 95% stenosis of her
left circumflex with a "miniscule" RCA with 30% mid segment
stenosis.
.
Patient is on oxygen at baseline for COPD-usually 2L but
recently increased to 2.5L. She also endorsed increased lower
extremity swelling since her ankle fracture 3 weeks ago. She
describes leg weakness and chronic back pain.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for presence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, ankle edema, but absence of palpitations,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, syncope or presyncope.

Reports/Imaging
3/14Cath
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
revealed
one vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had no
angiographically
apparent disease. The Lcx had a subtotal 95% occlusion at the
mid
vessel. The LAD had minimal diffuse disease throughout. The RCA
was
nondominant, small vessel without any angiographically apparent
disease.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic
hypertension
with a central pressure of 160/67 mmHg.
3. Successful primary angioplasty (direct stenting) of the mid
LCX with
a 3.0x18 mm Vision BMS. Final angiography revealed 0% residual
stenosis
without dissection or distal emboli.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate systemic hypertension.
3. Successful BMS stenting to Lcx.

[**2153-4-22**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
basal inferior/infero-lateral hypokinesis with overall preserved
left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**2-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
78yo female with a history of multiple medical problems
including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and peripheral
vascular disease was admitted with STEMI and had a bare metal
stent placed to the left circumflex.
.
#. CAD now s/pSTMEI: Has multiple risks for CAD as detailed
above. Her history of multiple episodes of epigastric pain
appears most consistent with unstable angina. Patient had STE in
inferior region but has left dominant system. Patient had BMS to
LCx and now is chest pain free.  She was continued on aspirin.
Although patient was concerned about starting statin because of
prior myopathy on different formulations, she agreed to try
Crestor which she tolerated without adverse reaction. Fasting
lipid panel showed LDL at goal. Started ACEI at low dose and no
adverse reaction so increased to 5mg PO qday. Also started
metoprolol at 12.5 mg PO BID which she tolerated well.
.
#Hematoma: Patient developed a 6x4 inch hematoma in right groin
s/p cath. Her hematocrit droped initially and required 3 units
of blood.  Throughout this she was hemodynamically stable. Her
hematocrit stabilized and hematocrit
