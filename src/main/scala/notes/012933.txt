Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 949**]
Chief Complaint:
flank pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
RIJ

History of Present Illness:
51yo female with a history of hepatic cirrhosis due to alcohol,
alcohol abuse, chronic pancreatitis, and asthma was admitted
from the Emergency Department with flank pain. Patient is a very
poor historian due to alcohol intoxication.
.
She reports that she has had multiple falls over the last 1.5
weeks due to gait instability and dizziness. She reports that
she had not been drinking alcohol during these falls. Then on
the morning of admission she developed marked worsening of her
pain for which she drank two drinks of vodka and cranberry juice
on the morning of admission.
.
Of note, she has had the following multiple admissions since
[**12-28**]:
- [**Date range (2) 31375**] - pancreatitis, abdominal pain, and alcoholism

- 1/22-27/09 - hematemesis requiring endoscopy with banding
- 2/14-17/09 - abdominal pain
- 2/23-26/09 - abdominal pain, alcohol intoxication
- 3/27-27/09 - nausea and vomiting, signed out AMA when
narcotics were not given
- [**Date range (1) 31376**] - hematemesis with EGD demonstrating varices
- [**Date range (1) 31377**] - nonspecific abdominal pain
- [**2182-4-2**] - abdominal pain and alcohol intoxication
.
Upon arrival to the ED, temp 99.5, HR 90, BP 79/47, RR 16, and
pulse ox 97% on RA. Her exam was notable for generalized
abdominal pain. Her labs were notable for ALT 45, AST 138, TB 3,
serum EtOH 266, serum acetaminophen 10.2, and INR 1.8. CT scan
in the ED was notable for patchy ground glass opacities
throughout the lungs, pancreatitis, liver cirrhosis, and air in
the biliary tree. She received ceftriaxone 2g IV x 1, dilaudid
2mg IV x 2, ampicillin / sulbactam, levofloxacin 750mg IV x 1,
vancomycin 1g IV x 1, and norepinephrine.

.
- [**2182-5-11**] - ECG - sinus rhythm at ~80bpm, normal axis, no acute
ST changes
- [**2182-5-11**] - CT Head IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage
or fracture. Prominent sulci
and ventricles, compatible with brain atrophy, unchanged since
[**2176**].

- [**2182-5-11**] - CT C spine IMPRESSION: No evidence of fracture or
malalignment.

- [**2182-5-11**] - CT Chest / Abd / Pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1. Peripancreatic inflammatory stranding with peripancreatic
fluid, most
compatible with acute pancreatitis.
2. Cirrhotic liver, with evidence of portal hypertension.
3. Air within the biliary tree and gallbladder, which were not
evident on
prior study on [**2182-3-28**]. Correlate with any recent
interventions such as
ERCP.
4. Patchy bilateral airspace ground-glass opacities, which may
be infectious
or inflammatory in etiology, with a suggestion of a tiny right
pleural
effusion.

- [**2182-5-11**] [**Month/Day/Year 5283**] US
IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhotic liver with new thrombosis of the main portal vein
which was not
present on the multiphasic CT of the abdomen of [**2182-3-28**].

2. Air within the gallbladder, better appreciated on CT from
today. No
gallstones.

3. Nonvisualization of the left hepatic vein.

CXR:
Lung volumes are lower, mediastinal vasculature is appreciably
more distended
and pulmonary vessels are mildly dilated, all suggesting volume
overload and
borderline cardiac decompensation. Heart size is normal but
increased since
yesterday. Right jugular line ends centrally

MRCP: [**2182-5-13**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings compatible with cirrhosis with fatty change in the
liver. The
portal venous system is patent.
2. Ascites as well as peripancreatic fluid. There is mild
heterogeneous
enhancement of the head of the pancreas. Findings are probably
due to
pancreatitis. Recommend clinical correlation.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis at the lung
bases, right
greater than left.

[**Month/Day/Year 5283**] U/S [**5-18**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Cirrhosis, with splenomegaly.
2. No evidence of cholecystitis.
3. No evidence of ascites, with a note made of a right pleural
effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
51yo female with history of alcoholic cirrhosis, alcohol abuse,
and chronic pancreatitis was admitted from the ED with septic
shock.

1. Septic Shock

Etiology of her septic shock is likely GPC bacteremia.  Source
is not clear.  No obvious skin source.  ? IVDU.  Relatively
immunocompromised. She was hypotensive in the Emergency
Department on arrival, although her blood pressure has improved
with IVF boluses. Now off pressors.  Plan is the following:

- follow-up final read of CT scan and [**Month/Year (2) 5283**] US -> findings c/w
pancreatitis, PV thrombosis, a few ground glass opacities

- follow-up blood and urine cultures

- continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and
cipro/flagyl,

- pain control with IV morphine for now

- IVF resuscitation with NS to aim for MAP > 60, goal UOP
30mL/hour



2. Acute Pancreatitis
The patient was initally hypotensive in the ED with SBP's in the
70's.  She was initailly on norepi for blood pressure support.
She was initially treated boadly with antibiotic, initally
ceftriaxone 2g IV x 1, ampicillin / sulbactam, levofloxacin
750mg IV x 1, vancomycin 1g IV x 1 in the ED. The patient had
findings consistent of pancreatitis on CT scan, most likely
related to alcoholism. Additional possibilities include
gallstone pancreatitis, although no significant findings of
gallstones were seen on [**Month/Year (2) 5283**] US. She was seen by surgery who
followed her during her admission.  She was given aggressive
fluid resuscitation initally in the MICU and weaned off pressors
shortly after admission.  Her antibiotics were narrowed to
vancomycin/cipro/flagyl.  The patient's blood pressure remained
stable and she was transferred to the floors.  She underwent
MRCP that was also consistent with pancreatitis. She also
underwent a repeat [**Month/Year (2) 5283**] that did not show obstruction or ascites.
 Her antibiotics were discontinued. She initally required pain
regimen with IV dilaudid and was transitioned to po d
