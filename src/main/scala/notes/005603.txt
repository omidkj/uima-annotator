Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
VT Storm

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Defibrillation during cardiac arrest

History of Present Illness:
60 y/o F w/ h/o dilated cardiomyopathy EF 20%, CAD and NSTEMI,
s/p BMS to LAD in [**3-16**], DM, Asthma, HTN, pulmonary HTN, h/o
Complete heart block, BiV ICD, who presents with VT storm.
Patient was recently hospitalized for syncope.  During that stay
she was found to have complete heart block and BiV Pacer and ICD
for primary prevention was placed.  Prior to this stay patient
was in her USOH until this weekend when her ICD discharged.
Patient was seen in device clinic on [**2105-5-11**] where her BiV ICD
was interrogated.  At that time the device reported two recent
episodes of VF one that had been terminated by a 36 joule shock.
 Her K+ was noted to be 3.2.  She was given PO potassium
supplements, PO amiodarone 200mg [**Hospital1 **], but diuretics were
continued.
.
Over the next 3 days patient had several ICD shocks.  Spoke with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who referred patient for admission.  Patient came
to ED by EMS.
.
In the ED, initial vitals: T97.8, Bp96/58, HR 88, RR 16, O2
100%RA.  Patient was seen by EP who interrogated device.  Felt
to have monomorphic VT at 220bpm with 7 shocks in last 3 days.
Impression was for over diuresis and hypokalemia triggering VT.
She was admitted to the CCU for management.
.
On arrival to the CCU, patient was stable and without
complaints.  She was given 40meq K+, Amiodarone 150mg IVx1.  She
subsequently had 7-10 episodes of recurrent VT over the next [**1-9**]
hours.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools.  She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 60 y/o F w/ DM, dilated non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy, CAD, p/w VT storm in setting of hypokalemia. Her
rhythm strips were consistent with Torsades. She was admitted to
the CCU on the Electrophysiology service. She was started on an
amiodarone infusion with initial bolus as well as lidocaine
infusion. She was given magnesium infusion and her electrolytes
were monitored with a goal of K>4 and Mg>2.5. At approximately
4:50am, patient was noted to be pulseless and a code was called.
 PEA algorithim was followed -- see code report for details --
and initial impression was for metabolic arrest [**2-9**] to
hyperkalemia/hypoglycemia or acidemia.  She was given
bicarbonate, glucose, insulin and calcium in addition to
epinephrine/atropine/vasopressin.  Pulse was intermittently
recovered and patient was given IVF's, dopamine and
neosynephrine.  Femoral line was placed for IV access.
Intubation was complicated by significant amount of aspiration
of stomach contents during the code.  Patient was difficult to
oxygenate during the code, but after successful intubation there
were no further apparent complications with her airway.  Bedside
echo demonstrated no pericardial effusion/tamponade, and showed
a hypocontractile left ventricle.  She had symmetric breath
sounds, and no apparent evidence of tension pneumothorax.  She
was shocked for VT x2 by external pacer pads during the code
with successful return of underlying rhythm, but without
sustained return of her pulse.  Ultimately, pulse could not be
maintained  in the face of substantial acidemia, and hypoxemia.
Lab work demonstrated profound respiratory acidemia with pH <
7.0.  She was given bicarbonate acutely and bag ventilation was
increased.  After 45 minutes of the above the decision was made
to terminate the code given prolonged hypoxemia and
pulselessness.  Time of death: 5:37AM.  [**Hospital **] healthcare
proxy, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] care team notified.
