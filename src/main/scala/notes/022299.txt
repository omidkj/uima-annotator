Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2200-7-30**] right IJ central line placement


History of Present Illness:
71 year old Haitian-Creole female with history of CVA, HTN/HL,
breast CA in remission, presumed CHF (on furosemide), and type 2
DM presenting with altered mental status from home. Her daughter
and grand-daughter provided much of the following history.  The
patient started to feel poorly 2 days PTA, when she started
vomiting from an unknown cause.  Since that time, she had become
progressively less responsive and was weak on her feet.  She is
normally able to get around with a cane or a walker, ascend
stairs, and walk independently.  However, she had difficulty
even standing up.  She did not eat or drink anything since
vomiting. She intermittently complains of abdominal pain of
fleeting character, but denies any urinary symptoms. She has a
history of GI bleeding, per the family, which they describe as
"mixed red and black". Her last "bloody" stool was about 2 weeks
ago.  No associated falls or trauma.  No recent medication
changes.  She recently visited her PCP within the past 2 weeks
and was due to return shortly to follow-up on her medications
and chronic conditions.

In the ED, initial vitals were: 98.7 53 100/53 18 96% on 2L.
Initial EKG shows ?complete AV block, prompting concern for CCB
toxicity and treatment with calcium gluconate + glucagon.
Subsequent EKGs showed 1st degree AV at a rate of 60bpm.
However, she remained hypotensive (lowest [**Location (un) 1131**] 63/50) and had
very difficult access, prompting insertion of an 18GA L EJ and a
RIJ triple lumen CVL.  After 1.5L NS (creatinine 3.7, unknown
baseline) and 1 units pRBCs (Hct 21.6, unknown baseline), CVP
was measured at 22.  Guaiac negative.  CT head and CT abd/pelvis
did not show any acute bleeding. CXR clear of infiltrate with
evidence of cardiomegaly in AP view.

She was seen by Cardiology in the ED who felt that her acute
kidney injury may have led to decreased clearance of diltiazem
resulting in AV nodal blockade, which spontaneously resolved.
They recommended aggressive fluid resuscitation to assess BP
response and monitoring on telemetry, with admission to MICU for
further work-up.

On arrival to the MICU, she was normotensive and no longer
bradycardic, still disoriented and picking at her central line.
She is not in any pain.
