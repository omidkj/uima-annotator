Echo [**2184-10-25**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior hypokinesis. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is a small pericardial effusion without tamponade.



Brief Hospital Course:
81F EF 45% inf HK, afib/C, DVT, dm2, copd p/w rapid afib and in
setting of rapid rate has angina and CHF
.
1. Cardiac:
a. Rhythm:
Pt was in rapid afib on admission.  Initially ther was poor rate
control in house and the patient went to ICU. She was on
atenolol 12.5 daily that uptitrated gradually and rate control
improved.  Pt's coumadin was held on admission for a
supratherapeutic level, though it was restarted.
.
b. Coronaries:
The patient did have anginal symptoms in the setting of rapid
heart rate. There was no known h/o CAD, though there is EF 45%
with inf HK which suggests CAD. The chest pain was likely
related to the rapid afib. The ECG showed only non-specific
changes. Enzymes showed trop t 0.03 with negative CK and MB.  Pt
was rate controlled as described and continued with aspirin,
beta blocker, and statin.

c. [**Name (NI) **]
Pt presented in acute CHF with pulmonary edema. LVEF 45%. The
patient was diuresed. She was continued on beta blocker and we
started an ace inhibitor as well.

2. Confusion:
Pt has h/o dementia and was hospitalized with mutliple sedatives
and psych meds.  Pt's sedating medications were held in house.
Confusion resolved and patient oriented again to person, place,
and time by hospital day 4.

3. Pleural effusions:
There were bilateral, moderate on the left and small on the
right. This is unlikely contributing to SOB. The plan was to
diurese and treat CHF.
.
4. Leukocytosis:
Pt had WBC of 16 on admission, but this resolved over hospital
course down to 11.1. Likely stress response.  Pt is afebrile, UA
is negative. CXR is c/w CHF.

5. Diabetes Mellitus
Patient c/w metformin and SSI in-house.
.
