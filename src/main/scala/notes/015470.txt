Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 49-year-old male with
poorly controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia with
refractive atrial fibrillation who has been cardioverted
every few months since [**2103-4-2**], but only remains in
normal sinus rhythm a few weeks after cardioversion.  An RF
ablation was attempted in [**2106-5-3**], but was aborted due
to vagal episodes and systolic blood pressures in the 50s.
He was admitted [**2106-8-2**] for an elective RF ablation.
During the procedure, contrast was noted in the pericardium
which was thought due to a possible septal perforation.
Transesophageal echocardiogram was done which showed a
moderate sized effusion and patient began hypotensive.
Tamponade was suspected and pericardial drain was placed from
which approximately 300 cc was removed with another 60 cc
being removed over the following hour.  A repeat
echocardiogram was then performed which showed that the drain
was still in place and there was no residual effusion.  While
in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, the patient complained of
chest pain refractory to most medications and 1% lidocaine
was administered through the drain with excellent relief of
symptoms.

He was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for close
hemodynamic monitoring, as well as telemetry.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Peptic ulcer disease.
3.  Asthma.
4.  Gout.
5.  Hyperlipidemia.
6.  Atrial fibrillation.
7.  Status post spinal cord injury from a motor vehicle
accident in [**2094**].

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Neck surgery secondary to motor vehicle accident.
2.  Laryngeal polyps removed as a teenager.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient denies any tobacco use.  Occasional
alcohol use.  He is married.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Hyzaar 100/25 mg.
2.  Norvasc 5 mg.
3.  Atenolol 25 mg.
4.  Probenecid 500 mg b.i.d.
5.  Aspirin 81 mg q.d.

ALLERGIES:  Zestoretic causing gastrointestinal upset.
Penicillin, allopurinol causing facial swelling.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO THE CORONARY CARE UNIT:
Temperature 99.9.  Blood pressure 131/74.  Heart rate 86 in
normal sinus rhythm. Respiratory rate 20.  Oxygen saturation
95% on three liters nasal cannula.  Patient is in no apparent
distress, winces mildly in pain. Oropharynx is clear.  Mucous
membranes were moist.  There was no carotid bruits present.
His lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly (patient was
lying flat due to pericardial drain).  His heart was regular
rate with a normal S1, S2.  The drain was in place with no
oozing or hematoma.  On abdominal exam, the patient was
nontender, nondistended, normal active bowel sounds were
present.  There was no hepatosplenomegaly.  There was no
cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  The femoral sheath was in place
on the left side.  There was no hematoma or signs of
infection.  2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses
were felt bilaterally.  Skin was warm and dry.  He was alert
and oriented, mildly sedated, but answered questions
appropriately.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 18.1,
hemoglobin 15.3, hematocrit 42.9, platelet count 233,000.  PT
13.1, PTT 28.0.  Sodium 142, potassium 3.9, chloride 104,
bicarbonate 27, BUN 19, creatinine 1.1, glucose of 136.

ADMISSION ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Showed normal sinus rhythm with
a heart rate of 95, normal axis and intervals, no acute ST or
T wave changes when compared to previous electrocardiograms.

IMPRESSION:  This is a 49-year-old man with refractory atrial
fibrillation, here for a second RF ablation, complicated by
perforation and tamponade, treated with pericardial drain and
resolution of effusion by transesophageal echocardiogram.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1. Cardiac:  The patient was transferred to the Coronary Care
Unit with a pericardial drain in place, very sedated.  He
developed atrial fibrillation around 11 a.m. the following
day and was cardioverted times two with 2 mg intravenous
ibutilide administered with reversion back to normal sinus
rhythm.  Pericardial drain was pulled a few hours later.  A
transesophageal echocardiogram was performed which showed no
pericardial effusion and no pulmonary vein stenosis.  A small
ASD which was previously known was also noted.  Following
conversion to normal sinus rhythm, the patient was started on
propafenone 225 b.i.d.  He was also restarted on his losartan
100 and Atenolol 50 q.d. which he takes as an outpatient.  No
other events were noted on telemetry and patient remained in
normal sinus rhythm for remainder of hospital course.

2.  Pulmonary:  Patient with no signs of heart failure.
Oxygen saturations were in the high 90s on two liters nasal
cannula.

3.  Hematology:  Of note, hematocrit dropped from 43 to 35
which was assumed mostly dilutional due to large volume of
intravenous fluids administered. He was stable around 35 on
discharge.

4.  Rheumatology:  The patient was treated with probenecid
for gout prophylaxis.  He had no symptoms of acute gout
during the hospital course.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Stable and improved.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Atrial fibrillation, status post RF ablation.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hyperlipidemia.
4.  Gout.
5.  Peptic ulcer disease.
6.  Asthma.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lipitor 10 q.d.
2.  Colace 200 b.i.d.
3.  Prednisone taper for pericardial irritation.
4.  Atenolol 50 q.d.
5.  Propafenone 225 b.i.d.
6.  Losartan 100 q.d.
7.  Percocet 1-2 tablets q. 4-6 hours prn pain #30 pills.
8.  Aspirin 325 mg.

FOLLOW-UP:
1.  Patient to schedule an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
one month.
2. Two week course of [**Doctor Last Name **] of Heart's.  Patient was scheduled
to have [**Doctor Last Name **] of Heart's set up before discharge, however,
patient refused to wait for the [**Doctor Last Name **] of Heart's to be placed
and, therefore, arrangements were made for patient to go to
Holter laboratory for [**Doctor Last Name **] of Heart's to be set up and
patient was instructed to stop by the Holter Laboratory
immediately after discharge.
3.  Repeat cardiac MRI to be scheduled one month as an
outpatient by Electrophysiology.
