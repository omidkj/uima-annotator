CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypertensive episode with hypoxia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 52-year-old
male with multiple medical problems and complex past medical
history recently discharged from [**Hospital1 190**] in early [**2153-5-26**] after extensive two month
hospital stay initially for dyspnea on exertion/shortness of
breath with right-sided heart catheterization showing fluid
overload, initially improved with palliative therapy using
Swan in the Coronary Care Unit.  However, [**Hospital 228**] hospital
course was complicated by intubation for hypercapnia and
sedation and then subsequent difficulty in being off a
ventilator.  He was subsequently transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for respiratory failure management at
which point he was treated for a right lower lobe pneumonia,
presumed Staph in origin, with intravenous vancomycin.  He
subsequently underwent placement of a trach for prolonged
respiratory care and also underwent a percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube.  These procedures were ultimately
complicated at the PEG by a large gastric hematoma requiring
multiple units of packed red blood cells.  Ultimately, the
patient required aggressive body fluid resuscitation and
several units of packed red blood cells and was returned to
the Intensive Care Unit for symptoms of volume overload.  He
was then diuresed again to near euvolemia.  His hospital
course was mired by difficulties in managing his fluid
balance; he was constantly fluctuating between hyper and
hypovolemia and congestive heart failure versus acute renal
failure.  Ultimately, he did develop increased renal failure
of unclear etiology and ultimately was started on
hemodialysis.  Later during his hospital course from a
respiratory standpoint, he developed a Pseudomonas and
Enterobacter pneumonia for which he was treated with
ceftazidime and Levaquin.  Also during his hospital course he
had an Enterococcus bacteremia.  Ultimately he was discharged
off of trach ventilation support to [**Hospital1 **] on [**2153-5-28**].
He had been weaned off the ventilator for five days.

However, on this admission the patient presented with an
increased lethargy and was found to have acute desaturations
into the 60's and 70's on trach mask 50 percent while being
on the commode.  The patient was noted to become cyanotic and
was thought to be unresponsive.  The patient was subsequently
bagged with a recovery of oxygen saturations but systolic
blood pressures dropped into the 60's and 70's.  The patient
then received one liter of normal saline and was transferred
to the [**Hospital1 69**] Emergency
Department where patient had improvement in his pressures
into the 70's and 80's and was asymptomatic at this point;
however, patient received additional three liters of
intravenous fluids, aspirin, heparin, empiric vancomycin and
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  Currently the
patient is comfortable without complaints.  He denies any
shortness of breath, coughing, fever or chills.  He denies
chest pain currently but does report fleeting chest pain at
the time of the hypoxia and hypotension episode subsequently
resolved spontaneously.  No abdominal pain, nausea or
vomiting.

platelet count 208,000.  INR 1.6, PTT 31.9.  His chemistry
shows sodium 145, potassium 4.9, chloride 107, bicarb 25, BUN
77, creatinine 4.4, sugar 238.  Calcium, magnesium and

____________ on chest x-ray.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Shows atrial fibrillation 103-94, low
voltage.  Question of old inferior Q-waves and old T-wave
inversions in anterolateral leads.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Hypotension.  It is unclear as to the exact etiology of
   his hypotension.  Initially, there were concerns about
   possible sepsis given particularly the elevated lactate.
   However, patient's blood cultures were negative.  A
   cortisol level was checked as patient's cortisol has been
   _____________ in the past which were all within normal
   limits.  Possible concerns for hypotension with hypoxia
   with aggressive positive pressure ventilation therefore
   decrease in preload.  Other thoughts were possible
   pulmonary embolism which could possibly explain hypoxia
   and hypotension.  At any rate, however, by the time he
   returned to the Emergency Department had pressures that
   were running into the 80's and 90's which is near his
   baseline.  A further workup for pulmonary embolism was not
   sought after.  He needed to be heparinized for his
   mechanical valve and for question of troponin leak.  Given
   the fact that they were concerned about preserving
   possible kidney function, contrast dye with CT was not
   desired.  As mentioned above, the patient has low blood
   pressures into the 70's and 80's but has been
   asymptomatic.  He will be given cautious amounts of a beta
   blockade as per his initial outpatient regimen.

1. Congestive heart failure.  Patient with a history of
   cardiomyopathy of [**11-9**] percent and by time of Intensive
   Care Unit evaluation was grossly overloaded although
   compensated on positive pressure ventilation with sats in
   the mid 90's.  The patient was challenging in terms of
   marginal blood pressures and also b
