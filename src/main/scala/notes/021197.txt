Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Nsaids / Aspirin / Influenza Virus Vaccine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Right foot and calf pain, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
52 yo F with history of pulmonary hypertension (prescribed 3L
home oxygen) presented with right foot pain, mild right calf
pain and redness. At presentation to ED denied chest pain,
dyspnea, fevers, chills, no new numbness or weakness.
.
In the emergency department, patient presented at approximately
2330 on [**2161-11-3**]. Initial vitals were T 97.8, HR 80, BP
143/100, RR 17, O2Sat 98% 2L NC. Her complaint of right calf
pain and tenderness prompted LENIS, which were negative. She was
started on Vancomycin for empiric cellultits treatment. CBC,
Chem 7, and troponin at presentation including were normal. Only
abnormal lab was slight INR elevation to 1.3. She received her
home medications in the ED overnight including omeprazole,
metoprolol, albuterol, and gabapentin. Also received two rounds
of 4 mg IV morphine for pain. On morning of [**11-4**] patient was
noted to have oxygen sat of 85% on 3L NC. She was additionally
complaining of chest pain. The chest pain resolved with
administration of nebulizers. She was awake at that time and
appearing compfortable and then was placed on NRB for
supplemental oxygen. Due to concern for PE, a CTA was obtained
and on prelim read showed no PE, but was consistent with CHF
showing cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Given unknown etiology
of hypoxemia, ED started levofloxacin and drew troponin and CK
again. Vitals immediately prior to transfer to the ICU were T
afebrile, HR 86, BP 127/87, RR 21, O2Sat 94% on NRB.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient denies chest pain or
dyspnea, though notes they were present transiently in the ED.
Her predominant complaint continues to be right foot and calf
pain. She denies fevers.
.

Microbiology:
[**2161-11-4**] Blood cultures: pending, no growth to date at time of
discharge
[**2161-11-5**] Urine culture: final, no growth
.
Imaging:
[**2161-11-4**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Marked
right axis deviation. Right ventricular hypertrophy. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2161-11-4**] no diagnostic interim change.
Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
[**2161-11-4**] Bilateral LENIS: No evidence of DVT. Limited assessment
of the right peroneal veins.
.
[**2161-11-4**] Right foot x-ray: There is no fracture or osseous
malalignment. There are no focal sclerotic or lytic lesions.
Slight generalized
demiineralization. There is fragmentation sugging old fracture
of distal
dorsal suirface of tarsal navicular. No acute fracture. An
incidental plantar calcaneal spur is noted. IMPRESSION: No
evidence of osteomyelitis.
.
[**2161-11-4**] CXR: Lungs are grossly clear. There is no pleural
abnormality or good evidence for central adenopathy.
Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly with particular enlargement of
central pulmonary artery is longstanding.
.
[**2161-11-4**] CTA Chest:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Marked cardiomegaly, and interstitial prominence without
frank edema,
consistent with congestive heart failure.
3. Right lower lobe 8 mm pulmonary nodule. Recommend three-month
followup.
.
[**2161-11-5**] TTE: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is very small, with
reduced diastolic filling secondary to the reverse Bernheim
effect. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 75%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is markedly dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The main pulmonary
artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are dilated.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
