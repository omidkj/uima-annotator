History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 63208**] is a 75M with known severe CAD s/p CABG in [**2167**],
systolic and diastolic CHF (EF 30%), and PVD, s/p recent
complicated admission from [**Date range (1) 107779**]/07 for NSTEMI, who
re-presented to the ED on the evening of [**9-26**] complaining of
shortness of breath. He states that since his recent discharge
on [**9-16**] until yesterday, he has been in his USOH, which features
stable dyspnea on exertion, 3-pillow orthopnea, lower extremity
claudication, and chronic angina which responds to SL nitrates.
He reports that yesterday afternoon he was out shopping with his
son when he experienced bilateral leg and hip pain, as well as
his typical chest pain. No radiation, no assoc SOB, n/v,
diaphoresis. He took two SL nitros with resolution of the pain.
His lower extremity symptoms resolved with rest.
.
Later that evening he was watching TV and went to bed feeling at
his baseline, which is "[**2-16**] shortness of breath." However,
during the night he awoke with acute onset shortness of breath
rated an [**2185-7-19**]. He sat up in bed and put the fan on, which
helped only minimally. He called his son, who lives upstairs,
and the son came and called EMS. He denies feeling any fevers or
chills, with no new cough. He denies chest pain, hand/arm pain,
nausea, or lightheadedness associated with the shortness of
breath. His chronic lower extremity edema has worsened of late.
He denies medication non-compliance or any type of dietary
indiscretion, stating that he has eaten mostly cereal and salmon
since discharge. He did have some ice cream the evening that his
symptoms developed.
.
In ED, had a CXR read as pulonary edema vs. infiltrate. Received
40mg IV lasix, to which he put out 500cc urine. Albuterol nebs
administered with minimal effect. Got Levoflox 750 IV x1 per ED
protocol. BiPAP was attempted, but pt refused. Nitroglycerin gtt
then started. Initially admitted to MICU team, where he noted to
be in obvious respiratory distress, with accessory muscle use,
tachypneic to high 30s. Received 120mg IV lasix, IV morphine 2mg
with good effect. He then received 5mg metolazone with 180mg IV
Lasix, again with minimal output. He was then transferred to the
CCU team for his primarily cardiac issues.
.
In his prior hospital course he ruled in for NSTEMI and had
multiple caths and interventions where he was found to have
severe native and graft disease. After his third cath of the
admission, he developed chest pain, hypertension, and
repsiratory distress, for which he was transferred to the CCU.
There, he was aggressively diuresed with significant improvement
in his respiratory status. Additionally, he was febrile and
found to have staph aureus bacteremia, for which he completed a
course of antibiotics. Finally, his CCU stay was complicated by
the development of complete heart block with bradycardia, for
which pacer placement was planned, but not performed pending
resolution of bacteremia with negative surveillence blood
cultures.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He does endorse exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for chronic exertional
chest pain relived by SL nitrates, chronic dyspnea on exertion,
3-pillow orthopnea, and chronic LE edema. No palpitations,
syncope or presyncope.

[**9-26**] Admission Chest AP: There has been interval development of
diffuse perihilar reticular opacities and a few scattered Kerley
B lines within the right base along with predominantly alveolar
opacities within the lower lung fields (right greater than
left). The apices remain clear and heart size remains enlarged
with unchanged slightly tortuous intrathoracic aorta. No
evidence of pneumothorax or large pleural effusions.
.
[**9-26**] EKG demonstrated SR @ 97, RBBB, LAFB; prolonged PR;
unchanged from [**9-15**]
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**9-27**] demonstrated:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal to mid
inferior wall, mid inferior wall, anterolateral wall and apex
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] There
is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.9 cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is no pericardial
