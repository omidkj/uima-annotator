History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4549**] is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o female with CAD/ CHF, afib, diabetes,
presenting from clinic with dyspnea:

[**2146-5-30**]: corneal transplant.
10 days ago: increasing dyspnea/ orthopnea
5 days ago: Markedly worse dyspnea and chills, can no longer
walk without dyspnea.
1 day ago: shoulder pain relieved with lidocaine.

At her baseline she is legally blind and ambulates with a cane;
she has had falls in the past.

Denies weight gain, cough, chest pain, N/V. Has subjective
chills at home.  Positve right shoulder pain as above.  Patient
also states that she has not been drinking more water than
normal or eating more salt than normal.  She also states that
she has not had any stepwise changes in her dyspnea.  No sick
contacts.

Patient was referred from clinic where her respiratory rate was
36 and was labored.  Her pulse was 105 and irregular.  Her O2
sat was between 89% and 91% on room air.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.5, HR 117, BP 116/78, and she

Micro:

EKG ([**2146-7-21**]): Atrial fibrillation with a moderate ventricular
response. Non-specific ST-T wave changes, most notable in leads
VI-V2. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2128-5-11**] atrial
fibrillation has replaced sinus bradycardia. The septal T wave
changes have been previously noted.

TTE ([**2146-7-21**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%). The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal with depressed free wall contractility.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is at least moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension, with evidence of right ventricular
pressure overload and consequent ventricular interaction. There
is a very small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

AP PORTAL CHEST X-RAY ([**2146-7-21**]):
1. Mild pulmonary edema and small left pleural effusion.
2. Ill-defined opacity in the left lung base is nonspecific, but
could
reflect an area of atelectasis, or possibly infection.

PA/LATERAL CHEST X-RAY ([**2146-7-22**]): There is unchanged
cardiomegaly. There is persistent atelectasis versus developing
infiltrate at the left lung base. This is stable. There are no
signs for overt pulmonary edema or pneumothoraces. Overall,
there has been no interval change.

PA/LATERAL CHEST X-RAY ([**2146-7-24**]): Cardiac silhouette is
enlarged. There is some atelectasis at the lung bases. There are
no signs for overt pulmonary edema.  There is some prominence of
some of the interstitial markings and atelectasis of the left
lung base which is stable. There is minimal wedging of several
mid thoracic vertebral bodies.

AP PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY ([**2146-7-25**]): Lung volumes are lower today,
exaggerating relative caliber of distended mediastinal veins and
the extent of moderate cardiomegaly. Thoracic aorta is quite
tortuous and aneurysm is not really evaluated by this study.
Pleural effusion is minimal if any. No pneumothorax.

V/Q SCAN ([**2146-7-25**]): Multiple mismatched perfusion defects
bilaterally consistent with very high likelihood ratio of acute
pulmonary embolus.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4549**] is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o female with CAD/ CHF, afib, diabetes,
presenting from clinic with dyspnea.

# Dyspnea secondary to pulmonary embolism: Initially attributed
to diastolic CHF based on age, history of diabetes, JVP of
10-12cm and pleural effusion on CXR and BNP >10k, although dry
mucus membranes and no edema peripherally.  Diastolic
dysfunction was confirmed by echo.  Also initially considered
was PNA given hypothermia, but no history of cough and only mild
leukocytosis to 12.1k.  Initially Troponins negative x2 and no
evidence of ischemia by EKG.  Pulmonary embolism was also
initially considered, but other etiologies including diastolic
dysfunction were more likely initially and despite vague
shoulder pain, no frank chest pain and no stepwise changes in
dyspnea; patient described it as progressive shortness of
breath.
