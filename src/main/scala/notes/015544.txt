Service:  CARDIOTHOR

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 74-year-old
female admitted from [**Hospital3 **] on the [**12-26**]
with ST elevation MI (troponin 2.7).  She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac
catheterization which revealed a three vessel coronary artery
disease with good targets and right sided aortic
arch.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic back pain.
2.  Asthma.
3.  Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm 3.3 cm.
4.  History of transient ischemic attacks (carotid ultrasound
one year ago revealed 50% bilateral stenosis).
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Hypercholesterolemia.
7.  Status post right mastectomy.
8.  Status post bilateral renal endarterectomy.
9.  Chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine approximately
2.0).
10. Diverticulosis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  ABFS.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate
and rhythm, III/VI systolic ejection murmur at second
intercostal space.  Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds, no
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing or
edema.  Neuro:  No focal abnormalities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the C-MED Service
where an echo showed that the patient has an ejection
fraction of 60 to 65%, left atrial dilation with regional
left ventricular wall motion abnormalities and 2+ mitral
regurgitation.  The patient was placed on Nitrodrip titrated
to pain.

A carotid ultrasound revealed right internal carotid stenosis
40 to 59% and left internal carotid stenosis less than 40%.
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2123-12-29**] where a coronary artery bypass graft times four vessels
was performed.  The LIMA was brought to the LAD, SVG to the
PDA, SVG to OM, SVG to diagonal.  The patient's coronary
artery bypass was 72 minutes and cross clamp was 59 minutes.

The patient was transferred on Dobutamine, Neo-Synephrine and
Propofol drip and was subsequently transferred to the
Cardiothoracic ICU.  Postoperative day #1, the patient's
filling pressures remained low despite a cardiac index of
approximately 1.  The patient was weaned off Neo-Synephrine
and Dobutamine with increase in volume and maintained her
blood pressure to approximately 90s to 100s.

Subsequently on postoperative day #2, filling pressures were
increased with increased volume and cardiac index improved.
The patient was weaned off the Dobutamine completely.  ICU
postoperatively was also complicated by delirium which
resolved before transfer to the floor on postoperative day
#4.  The patient was stable on the floor and Foley and
epicardial pacing wires were all discontinued.

The patient progressed quite nicely saturating at 92% on room
air and maintained her heart rate in the 80s to 90s in sinus
rhythm with no complications.  The patient remained motivated
in therapy and continued aggressive pulmonary toilet.  On
postoperative day #6, the patient was discharged in good
condition to rehab.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehab.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass graft times four.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Fexofenadine 60 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
3.  Aspirin 325 p.o. q.d.
4.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Albuterol inhalers p.r.n.
7.  Vioxx 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
