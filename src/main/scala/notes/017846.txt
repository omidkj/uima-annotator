increased abdominal distention and CT showing peritoneal

she noted progressively increasing abdonminal girth. She denies
any associated abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills,
but does note pencil stools and increased frequency of loose

bleeding) as well as increased satiety and anorexia. She has not
had any weight loss or urinary symptoms. Pt spoke with Dr.

follow-up with him this week for these symptoms, but the

peritoneal, and mesenteric implants, concerning for
carcinomatosis.

CT pelvis: 1) Large amount of ascites with omental, peritoneal,
and mesenteric soft tissue implants suggestive of
carcinomatosis.
2) Soft tissue structures in the expected location of the
ovaries. If indicated, further evaluation may be performed by
ultrasound.
3) 10-cm segment of narrowing in the sigmoid colon, without
evidence of mechanical obstruction. While no infiltrating mass
is detected, it cannot be excluded.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was initially admitted to the general medicine
service.  She was transferred to gyn oncology on [**3-2**] for further
management of bowel obstruction and likely metastatic ovarian
cancer.  She was started on IV fluid and given nothing by mouth.
She also had initial consultation with medical oncology service.

She was taken to the OR on [**3-5**] for staging, cytoreduction, and
relief of obstruction.  Her surgery was notable for extensive
tumor debulking and 6L of ascites requiring prolonged surgery.
She was admitted to the SICU post operatively for post op volume
management.
Her ICU course was notable for a blood transfusion of 1 unit to
increase oncotic pressure. Otherwise she had no acute events and
was transferred to the floor on post op day 1.
The remainder of her post operative course is as follows:

1) GI: The pt's postop course was complicated by post-op ileus.
She was kept NPO with IVF.  Her IV access was lost on [**2123-3-9**]
(POD 4) and a PICC was placed.  Her bowel function resumed and
she was advanced to a full diet on [**2123-3-11**] (POD 6).

2) Pulmonary: The pt was noted to have decreased oxygen
saturations on [**2123-3-9**] (POD
4). A CTA could not be obtained as contrast could not be
administered through the pt's PICC. A V/Q scan revealed high
probability of pulmonary embolism. She was started on a heparin
gtt per weight-based protocol.  She was weaned off oxygen by POD
6. She received 10 mg [**Date Range 197**] on [**3-11**] and [**2123-3-12**]. Her INR was
then noted to be increased to 3.4 on [**2123-3-13**]. Her heparin gtt
was d/c'd and she was started on Lovenox 80 mg SQ [**Hospital1 **]. Her
[**Hospital1 197**] was held on [**3-13**]. Her INR was then 2.3 on [**3-14**] and she
was given 2.5 mg [**Month/Year (2) 197**] that night. The [**Month/Year (2) 197**] was
discontinued on [**3-15**] in preparation for port-a-cath placement.

3) Renal: The pt's urine output was adequate. Her foley catheter
was maintained in place until POD 3.

4) CV: The pt's blood pressure was stable on her home regimen of
Norvasc 5 mg qd.

5) FEN: The pt's electrolytes were checked and repleted daily as
needed.

6) Access: The pt received a port-a-cath on [**2123-3-17**] without
complications. Her PICC line was d/c'd on the day of discharge.

7) Psychiatry: The pt requested to be seen by psychiatry on the
day of discharge. She was evaluated and no medication was
recommended. She has outpatient psychiatric followup.

On day of discharge she was ambulating, voiding and tolerating
regular diet.  Her pain was well controlled with oral
medication.
