HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 63 year-old male with a
history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, head and
neck cancer, lower extremity deep venous thrombosis and
status post a recent extended hospitalization and intubation
for pneumonia and sepsis and adult respiratory distress
syndrome who returned from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital after a
witnessed aspiration.  The patient had previously been
discharged with a PEG tube for tube feedings as he had failed
a swallow study with aspiration of all consistencies of food
or fluid.  However, at the rehab facility the patient
developed respiratory distress and suctioning revealed tube
feed material in his lungs.  The patient developed an
increased oxygen requirement and a low grade fever and was
transferred to the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.  In the
Emergency Department the patient was felt to be in
respiratory distress and was hypoxic with an arterial blood
gas of 7.32/70/81.  The patient was asked if he would like to
be intubated for his respiratory distress and he responded
yes.  The patient was intubated and he was transferred to the
Medical Intensive Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

Head and neck cancer.

Tongue cancer status post radiation therapy.

Hypercholesterolemia.

Chronic tobacco use.

Lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.

Recent hospitalization for pneumonia, sepsis and adult
respiratory distress syndrome.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Levoxyl 50 micrograms daily.
2. Colace.
3. Lovenox 60 b.i.d.
4. Albuterol and Atrovent nebs.
5. Protonix 40 mg daily.
6. Coumadin.
7. He had received one dose of Vancomycin and Ceftazidine at
   the rehab facility.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was a long time smoker and is a
pool player.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 101.8.  Heart rate 116.
Blood pressure 148/77.  Respiratory rate 40.  Oxygen
saturation 60 percent on room air, 88  percent on
nonrebreather.  General tachypneic, uncomfortable.  HEENT on
BiPAP.  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.
Supple neck.  Cardiovascular examination tachycardic,
regular.  Lungs diffuse crackles.  Decreased breath sounds on
the left and rhonchi on the right.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended.  PEG tube in the left upper quadrant.
Extremities no lower extremity edema.  Chest x-ray showed
diffuse patchy infiltrates consistent with acute on chronic
aspiration pneumonia.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 12.6,
hematocrit 32.2, platelets 415, sodium 142, potassium 4.6,
bicarbonate 31, BUN 20, creatinine 0.7, lactate 1.9.

INTENSIVE CARE UNIT COURSE:
1. Respiratory failure:  The patient was admitted to the
   Intensive Care Unit and remained intubated overnight. The
   following morning he was switched to pressure support
   ventilation and was weaned off of the vent to face mask
   within 48 hours.  He was continued on his Albuterol
   Atrovent nebulizers.  The patient was felt to have had an
   aspiration pneumonitis and he was not given any further
   doses of antibiotics.  He remained afebrile without
   systemic signs of infection during his entire Intensive
   Care Unit stay.  The patient will need to be fed with tube
   feeds with the head of the bed elevated to decrease his
   risk of recurrent aspiration.

1. Aspiration:  The patient has a history of head and neck
   cancer, tongue cancer and a long intubation recently for
   adult respiratory distress syndrome.  After he was
   extubated during his previous hospitalization he was
   unable to swallow any fluid or liquid without aspiration.
   At that time the decision was made to place a PEG tube
   with a post pyloric entry point into the gastrointestinal
   tract to facilitate nutrition for this patient, however,
   this does not decrease his risk of aspiration
   significantly and the patient should continue to be fed
   with the head of the bed elevated.

1. Deep venous thrombosis:  The patient has a known lower
   extremity deep venous thrombosis.  He was continued on
   Lovenox 60 b.i.d. during his Intensive Care Unit stay and
   was started on transition to Warfarin.

1. Hypothyroidism:  The patient was continued on his
   outpatient dose of Levoxyl 50 micrograms daily.

The remainder of this discharge summary will be dictated by
the covering intern.
