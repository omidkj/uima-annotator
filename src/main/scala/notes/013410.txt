CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Disabling claudications of both legs
bilaterally.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 84-year-old male
with a past medical history significant for hypertension,
coronary artery disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease who presented to Dr.[**Name (NI) **] office complaining of
disabling claudication of both legs, right greater than left
that occurred after walking approximately 20 feet.  He had
undergone arterial reconstruction with a right femoral to
popliteal bypass approximately two years prior for
claudication.  He also had a right iliofemoral bypass.  The
iliofemoral graft subsequently occluded.  It was
thrombectomized once and he underwent angioplasty.  Each time
he had some period where the claudication resolved, but
recently the graft has thrombosed again.  The right femoral
to popliteal graft is noted to be opened.  The patient had
undergone an MRA that revealed a small aneurysm of the
infrarenal aorta with very diseased iliac vessels on both
sides.  The profundas were noted to be widely patent and the
superficial femoral artery on the left and the vein graft on
the right were patent.  The only reasonable option for
arterial reconstruction was an aortobifemoral graft.  It was
explained to the patient prior to the surgery of the
increased risk with this type of operation especially when
done for claudication alone.  The patient saw his
cardiologist prior to the attempted procedure where a
dobutamine stress echocardiogram was performed and failed to
reduce inducible ischemia.  He was subsequently cleared for
vascular surgery and admitted to [**Hospital1 **].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension
2.  Coronary artery disease with possible myocardial
infarction in the past.  Details are unknown.
3.  Significant nicotine abuse with over 50 pack year
history, stopped approximately 10 years ago.
4.  Hyperlipidemia
5.  Chronic renal insufficiency with baseline serum
creatinine of approximately 2.3.
6.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Right femoral to popliteal bypass, as well as a right
iliofemoral bypass.
2.  He was also noted to have a transurethral resection of
the prostate x2; one in [**2160**] and one in [**2157**].
3.  Bilateral total hip replacement.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Significant for living with his wife and
being a retired insurance [**Doctor Last Name 360**].  He is able to ambulate
independently.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital6 1760**] on [**2-24**] where he
underwent an aortobifemoral bypass bifurcated Dacron graft.
Details of this procedure are dictated in a separate
operative note.  The patient was then noted to tolerate the
procedure well and was extubated in the post anesthesia care
unit.  He was bolused with his epidural when he had some
breakthrough pain and subsequently became hypotensive and
desaturated.  The patient was then reintubated by anesthesia
and was noted to be quite acidotic.  He had a pH of 7.29 at
that time.  Stat labs were obtained and first round of
cardiac enzymes were negative for any significant elevation.
Electrocardiogram was also performed which revealed ST
depression in leads V2 through V4 and T-wave inversions in 2,
3 and AVF with slight elevation.

He was consulted with cardiology and maintained in the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  The following day, on
postoperative day #1, the patient was noted to have
significant elevations in his cardiac enzymes with CKs noted
to be 508 with an MB fraction of 42, index of 8.3 and a
troponin of over 50.  It was based on this that the patient
had officially ruled in for an acute myocardial infarction
and he was then started on intravenous nitroglycerin,
Lopressor.  He remained intubated and sedated for several
days.  He continued to progress and recover in the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit for the next several days and remained
hemodynamically stable.  He was extubated on postoperative
day #3 late in the day and was given aggressive chest
physical therapy.  He was then transferred back up to the
Vascular Intensive Care Unit on postoperative day #5 where he
was maintained on a face mask of 50% due to his chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and he was given aggressive
diuresis.  His creatinine was noted to increase up to 2.4 and
2.5 and he was managed conservatively.

He was intermittently confused and it was most likely felt to
be due to mild hypoxemia and volume overload.  He remained
hemodynamically stable however and did not require any
pressors or intervention.  Physical therapy was consulted on
postoperative day #5 and worked with him slowly.  On
postoperative day #6, he was noted to have copious amounts of
diarrhea, up to about nine bowel movements a day with an
elevated white count to 19,000.  Clostridium difficile
culture was sent and it ended up being positive for
Clostridium difficile toxin.  He was then started on Flagyl
500 mg po tid.  This will continue for 10 days.  The patient
continued to do well and was subsequently transferred out to
the floor.

At this time, he is doing quite well.  He is able to tolerate
a diet without difficulty.  He has had no fluctuation in his
blood pressure and has remained stable.  His Foley catheter
has been discontinued and he is currently working solely with
physical therapy.  They have recommended a rehabilitation
facility.  The family has looked into this and has decided
that he will go to [**Hospital 25576**] Rehabilitation.  He will be
transferred there tomorrow when a bed is available.  He is to
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] for staple removal of his groin.
The abdominal staples have been removed at this time and
Steri-Strips placed.  The groin staples are not to be removed
until followed up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Isosorbide 20 mg po bid
2.  Cardura 4 mg po qd
3.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous [**Hospital1 **]
4.  Protonix 40 mg po qd
5.  Lipitor 10 mg po qd
6.  Aspirin 325 mg po qd

10. Flagyl 500 mg po tid to stop on [**2174-3-11**].
11. Percocet 1 to 2 tablets po q4h

He is to have daily physical therapy as tolerated.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Disabling claudication secondary to significant
aortoiliac disease.
2.  Perioperative myocardial infarction currently stable and
managed with postoperative beta blockade.
3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease currently stable
with need for aggressive chest physical therapy.
4.  Clostridium difficile positive, currently being managed
with Flagyl 500 mg po tid to stop on [**2174-3-11**], to
complete a 10 day course.
