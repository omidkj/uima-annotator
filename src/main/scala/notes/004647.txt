Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
R hemiparesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
44 year old male with few known details of
previous medical history med flighted to [**Hospital1 18**] with left 6x6cm
intracerebral hemorrhage. Per limited EMS reports the patient
was
walking down to his fishing boat and suddenly complained of
headache and fell to the ground shouting "I need help." EMS was
called and reported right sided weakness and "aphasia." His
blood
pressure at the scene was 190/120 per EMS records. The pt had a
head CT at the OSH revealing large 6x6m intracerebral hemorrhage
encompassing large region of basal ganglia and extending
posteriorly towards the thalamus. Pt was intubated and
medflighted to [**Hospital1 18**]. En route the pt was given phosphenytoin 1g
IV, Fentanyl 600mg, Ativan 4mg IV and Propofol.

CT on admission: Large left basal ganglia hemorrhage with
associated mass effect. No significant change from outside
hospital study performed 2.5 hours earlier

CT/CTA 5/1/8: HEAD CT: Again seen is a left basal ganglia
hematoma with surrounding edema, unchanged from prior. There is
a stable mass effect on the left lateral ventricle and rightward
midline shift of approximately 5 mm. No new foci of hemorrhage
seen. Ventricles have not increased in size. Continued
prominence of the right lateral ventricle.
HEAD AND NECK CTA: The circle of [**Location (un) 431**] appears normal, and
there are no
obvious aneurysms associated with the anterior, middle or
posterior cerebral arteries. There is no convergence of vessels
towards the site of hemorrhage to suggest AVM. Again seen is
moderate mucosal thickening in the right maxillary sinus and
right sphenoid sinuses.
IMPRESSION: Essentially, no change compared to prior study with
no CTA
evidence for aneurysm or AVM.

ECHO [**6-16**] and unchanged [**6-26**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion. No vegetation seen (cannot
definitively exclude).

MRI [**6-20**]: Again seen is a large intraparenchymal hemorrhage
centered within the left basal ganglia which measures
approximately 7.2 x 3.6 cm in its greatest transverse
dimensions. There is surrounding vasogenic edema and there is
left to right subfalcine herniation and effacement of the left
ambient cistern as before.
There are multiple scattered areas of slow diffusion involving
both centrum semiovale as well as the corpus collosum, the left
globus pallidus, the white matter and [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter of the
occipital lobes and right frontal lobe as well as the pons
consistent with embolic infarcts.
Seen on the post-gadolinium MP-RAGE images are two small foci of
apparent enhancement involving either the cortex or the
subarachnoid space of the left frontal and parietal lobes near
the site of hemorrhage. This is of uncertain etiology and may
represent dilated veins or enhancement related to the embolic
infarcts.
The visualized orbits and major flow voids appear normal. There
is mucosal thickening within the right mastoid air cells as well
as the sphenoid, ethmoid, and maxillary sinuses. No suspicious
bony abnormalities are seen.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large left basal ganglia intraparenchymal hemorrhage with
surrounding vasogenic edema causing subfalcine herniation and
compression of the ambient cistern on the left.
2. Multiple embolic infarcts as described above, both supra and
infratentorially.
3. Two small foci of either cortical or subarachnoid enhancement
adjacent to the hemorrhage which may represent dilated veins
related to the hemorrhage or infarct-related enhancement.

CT [**6-29**]: Interval evolution of left basal ganglia hemorrhage
with decrease in size of the hematoma and decrease in mass
effect. No new hemorrhage identified. No new hypodensities seen
to suggest new focal abnormalities since the previous CT of
[**2114-6-14**].

CT ABD: CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The heart is normal in
appearance without pericardial effusion. Aside from minimal
dependent changes in the lung bases, no suspicious nodule,
opacity, or effusion is detected.

No arterially enhancing lesions are detected in the liver. The
gallbladder is contracted and normal in appearance. The adrenal
glands and kidneys are normal in appearance without focal
lesion. There is no hydronephrosis. The spleen is normal in size
and appearance.

A percutaneous gastrostomy tube is noted within the stomach with
adjacent foci of free air. The pancreas is normal in appearance
without focal lesion or peripancreatic stranding. The visualized
large and small bowel are normal in appearance. The appendix is
well visualized without inflammatory stranding, which is filled
with air and contrast. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes
are present within the mesentery or intraperitoneal locations
with the largest lymph node along the lesser sac of the stomach
(2:21) measuring 8 mm in short axis. There is no free fluid
within the abdomen.

CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: A Foley catheter is noted with balloon
and tip in the bladder. There is a moderate-to-large amount of
stool within the rectum which is otherwise unremarkable. The
prostate gland, and large and small bowel within the pelvis
appear normal. No adenopathy is detected.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative changes are noted in the lumbar
spine with facet joint narrowing and sclerosis. No suspicious
lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. No intra-abdominal abscess or inflammatory process detected
to explain fever of unknown origin.
2. Moderate-to-large amount of stool within the rectum.
3. Degenerative changes within the lower lumbar spine.

CT CHEST:
CHEST: There is no thoracic adenopathy, pleural or pericardial
effusion. The thoracic aortic caliber is normal, without
dissection. The heart is mildly enlarged. Coronary artery
calcifications are mild. There is no pleural or pericardial
effusion. There are no filling defects within the pulmonary
arteries. There is layering material within the right lower lobe
bronchus (3, 46). Throughout the right lung, there are scattered
vague foci of ground- glass opacity, slightly more confluent in
the right lower lobe. The lungs are otherwise clear. The imaged
upper abdominal viscera are unremarkable.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic
lesions. Mid
