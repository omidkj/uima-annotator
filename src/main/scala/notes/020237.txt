CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2168-5-31**]
FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: No significant change is
seen compared to prior study. Left-sided subclavian central
venous line again seen with tip at the cavoatrial junction.
Surgical clips again seen at the mediastinum. There are
persistent postoperative changes consistent with left
pneumonectomy, with persistent left hydropneumothorax, similar
in appearance compared to prior study. Mild blunting of the
right costophrenic angle consistent with small pleural effusion
is also unchanged.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW  [**2168-5-31**]
ORAL PHASE: There is moderate reduction in bolus formation,
bolus control, and anterior-to-posterior tongue movement. There
was moderate impairment in the base of the tongue retraction.
Moderate oral residue was noted after the swallow. No premature
spillover was seen in the pharynx.
PHARYNGEAL PHASE: The pharyngeal swallow was timely. There is
moderate reduction in laryngeal elevation and valve closure.
Epiglottic deflection was severely reduced. A moderate-to-severe
amount of residue remained in the vallecula, and a mild amount
of residue remained in the piriform sinuses after the swallow.
ASPIRATION/PENETRATION: There was penetration during the swallow
with thin liquids via straw sips. Aspiration occurred after the
swallow with thin- and thick-nectar liquids due to residue
falling from the laryngeal vestibule into the airway. Aspiration
was silent (without coughing). A cued cough was not effective in
clearing the aspirated material.
IMPRESSION:
1. Aspiration of thin liquids after the swallow with straw sips.
2. Cued cough was ineffective in clearing the aspirated
material.
3. No aspiration with nectar-thick liquid when
swallow-cough-swallow technique was performed.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is who was admitted on [**2168-5-23**] and underwent
successful  Left thoracotomy, left pneumonectomy with en bloc
chest wall resection (third rib); mediastinal lymph node
dissection, flexible bronchoscopy.  He was extubated in the
operating room and transferred to the SICU for close monitoring.
  His pain was managed with a Dilaudid Epidural managed by the
acute pain service.  He had a pen-rose drain , foley and NG tube
in place.  On POD #1 he was seen by ENT for his vagal resection
and found to have a left vocal fold paresis. He was seen by
Speech and Swallow and found to have moderate to severe
oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of small amounts of all
consistencies.  On POD #2 underwent Left true vocal fold Gelfoam
therapeutic injection.  On POD #3 he was transfused with 1 unit
PRBC to a Hct of 30, a Dobbhoff feeding tube was placed and tube
feeds were started per Nutrition recommendations. On POD #5 he
developed atrial fibrillation with a RVR and was started on IV
amiodarone converted to sinus rhythm within 24 hours.  On POD #6
he continued to remain hemodynamically stable and transferred to
the floor.  His epidural was converted to Dilaudid PCA with good
pain control. The foley was removed and he voided without
difficulty.  On POD #8 a repeat video-swallow was performed and
he aspirated with thin liquids. Speech recommended ground with
nectar thick and supervision feeds which was started and he
tolerated.  Follow-up Video-swallow in [**8-18**] days. He was seen by
physical therapy.  He was seen by ENT who recommended follow-up
in weeks.  On POD #10 he was restarted on his home medication
and PO pain meds.  He continued to make steady progress his
oxygen saturation remained 93% on room air while ambulating and
was discharged to rehab. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 77594**] as an outpatient.
