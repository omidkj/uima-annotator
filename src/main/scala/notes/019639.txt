Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
Left foot pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L foot debridement 9/14
L femoral artery, popliteal artery atherectomy [**9-5**]

History of Present Illness:
71 y/o male with DM 2, CAD severe 3v-d, Paroxysmal AFib, PVD,
ESRD on PD, admitted on [**8-28**] with a L plantar abscess. No signs
of osteo, was managed medically with abx until [**9-5**], pt went for
L SFA/popliteal atherectomy, went to OR for L plantar abscess
debridement. The pt developed post-op rapid A-fib, was treated
with dilt gtt and metoprolol 100 [**Hospital1 **], became hypotensive and
developed trop leak to 1.6, thought [**1-26**] demand ischemia with
hypotension related to the negative intropes. Rate remained
poorly controlled on dilt/metoprolol, amio started orally
without IV load, the pt was transferred to CCU for further
management. Enzymes are trending down.

Past Medical History:
1)CAD s/p CABG [**2102**]
2)PVD: s/p fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] bypass in [**12-29**] for cluadication, non-healing
ulcer on [**2-26**] s/p atherectomy of L SFA popliteal tbioperoneal
trunk with angioplasty x 2.  Pt had recent right first toe
amputation and left TMA on [**2107-3-24**].
3)Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
4)Type II DM: followed by [**Last Name (un) **]
5)Hyperlipidemia
6)Chronic bronchiectasis
7)EF 54%
8)BPH
9)Anemia of chronic illness
10)CRI on daily peritoneal dialysis

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Includes angioplasties of the left
common femoral, superficial femoral, tibioperoneal trunk in
[**2106-11-24**], left CEA in [**2102**] at [**Hospital1 2025**], coronary artery
bypasses, LIMA to the LAD and saphenous [**Hospital1 5703**] graft to the
obtuse marginal 1 and the ramus intermedius in [**2103-11-24**], cholecystectomy with exploratory lap with repair of
liver lacerations in [**2105-11-23**], PD catheter placement in
[**2106-9-24**], right eye cataract with intraocular lens, right
eye vitrectomy, right common femoral artery to posterior
tibial bypass graft with in situ saphenous [**Year (4 digits) 5703**] in [**2107-9-24**].


Social History:
He has been an active pharmacist until the surgery in [**Month (only) 958**]. He

Pertinent Results:
REPORTS:
ATHERECTOMY:
1. Access: 7F antegrade in the left common femoral artery.
2. Left lower extremity: The SFA had severe diffuse disease. The
popliteal artery had severe diffuse disease. The PT was patent
to the
foot. The distal PT had mild disease at the level of the
previous PTA
site.
3. Successful atherectomy of the LSFA and popliteal artery with
the SX
and LSF SilverHawk device with excellent results (see PTCA
comments).

[**9-16**] EKG:
Sinus rhythm. Biatrial abnormality. Low limb lead voltage. Q
waves in the
anterior leads with ST segment elevation consistent with acute
infarction or
aneurysm formation. Diffuse non-specific ST-T wave changes.
Compared to the
previous tracing no significant change

[**8-28**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Interstitial pulmonary edema and congestive heart
failure

[**9-16**] CXR:
FINDINGS: The left-sided central venous dialysis catheter ends
at the right atrium. The patient is status post median
sternotomy with normal alignment of the sutures. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is slight
improvement in the pulmonary edema.

[**9-21**] CXR:
Mild interstitial edema has improved substantially since
[**9-15**], less so since [**9-16**]. Small areas of
residual consolidation are present in the perihilar portions of
both lungs. A region of peribronchial infiltration in the right
lung apex may represent a new or recurrent pneumonia. Follow up
is advised.

MICRO:
 WOUND CULTURE L FOOT (Final [**2107-8-31**]):
      Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an
abbreviated
      workup is performed appropriate to the isolates recovered
from the
      site (including a screen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Staphylococcus
      aureus and beta streptococcus).
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    MODERATE GROWTH.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
      GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).    SPARSE GROWTH OF TWO COLONIAL
MORPHOLOGIES.
      STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.    SPARSE GROWTH.
