HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman
who is a resident of the [**Hospital3 1186**] who has a history of
Alzheimer's dementia, tardive dyskinesia, at baseline
nonverbal, and was noted at the nursing home to be having
increasing wheezing with 02 saturations in the 80s to low
90s.  Given Albuterol nebulizers and was still with wheezing.
Respiratory rate was noted to be in the 20-26 range, blood
pressure 112/60, heart rate 120s.  Of note, the patient was
on tube feeds.  She has stage III left heel ulcer and was on
morphine for pain management during dressing changes for
them.  Per son, the patient currently appears near her normal
self.

While she was in the Emergency Room, the blood pressure was
in the 90s, temperature of 102 and the patient was started on
ceftriaxone and Flagyl for a urinary tract infection as she
was noted to have pus in her Foley.  She was continued on
nebulizers and Solu-Medrol was started while in the Emergency
Room.  She received fluids and had improvement in her blood
pressure.

LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA: White count 12.4, 83%
neutrophils, 9% lymphs, hematocrit 31.5, platelets 449,000.
Chem-7 137, potassium 5.7, chloride 99, bicarbonate 27, BUN
44, creatinine 0.7, glucose 117, calcium 9.1, magnesium 2.2,
phosphorus 0.8.  INR 1.0.

The U/A on admission revealed a specific gravity of 1.014,
hazy, small leukocyte esterase, small blood, positive
nitrates, trace protein, negative glucose, negative ketones,
greater than 50 white blood cells and a few bacteria.

EKG was sinus tachycardia at 119.  Lactate of 3.0.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a [**Hospital 93961**] nursing home
resident, at baseline nonverbal secondary to dementia, who
was initially admitted for hypoxia and UTI, initially found
to be in sepsis and transferred to the VICU on the day of
admission.

1.  SEPSIS:  The patient was stable and initially admitted
under sepsis protocol to the VICU where she received
aggressive hydration, transfused 2 units of blood for a
hematocrit less than 30.  She was temporarily on Levophed and
eventually this was weaned off. She also had a subclavian
line placed for access for neurosepsis protocol.  The
patient's CVPs were monitored and were otherwise stable.  The
patient initially had some respiratory distress after her
fluid hydration but this improved and was stable with minimal
02 by nasal cannula.

Under sepsis protocol, the patient was started on broad
antibiotics including ceftazidime and levofloxacin.  The
patient was noted to have gram-negative rods growing from her
urine culture and eventually this grew out Citrobacter
.................... which was sensitive to levofloxacin and
ceftazidime and was the likely source of her sepsis.  There
was also initial concern for pneumonia; however, the patient
continued to improve, had follow-up chest x-rays.  The chest
x-ray on [**2106-5-28**] showed just mild CHF and no evidence of
pneumothorax.  The patient had a follow-up chest x-ray on
[**2106-5-31**] which was also consistent with CHF versus pneumonia.
However, the patient's oxygenation improved with diuresis and
was otherwise stable.

The patient was adrenally insufficient on the admission to
the VICU and is to complete a five day course of
hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone for adrenal insufficiency.
The patient's blood pressure remained stable.  The patient
was weaned off pressors pretty quickly and did not require
further fluid boluses to maintain blood pressure.

2.  HYPOXIA:  Initially came in hypoxic on room air.  This
improved with 3 liters of 02 and then after aggressive
hydration for her blood pressure was in mild respiratory
distress, transferred to the VICU but remained respiratory
stable on 2 liters and a cool nebulizer face mask.  She had a
blood gas of 7.40/37/185 and was oxygenating well.  She was
continued on nebulizers throughout her admission and her
wheezing improved.  She did continue to have some upper
airway sounds, some cough to help mobilize some of her
airways.  Otherwise, she was stable from a respiratory
standpoint.  She was eventually transferred to the floor and
continued to wean down her 02.  She was on [**3-9**] liters of
nasal cannula, continued on Albuterol and Atrovent
nebulizers.  She was given three doses of 10 mg of IV Lasix
throughout her stay on the floor and was weaned off oxygen
and was saturating 97% on 1 liter with minimal 02
requirements, very comfortable respiratory rate.

However, the plans are to complete a ten day course of
levofloxacin for the urinary tract infection, discontinue the
ceftazidime.
