Admission Date:  [**2147-10-23**]     Discharge Date:  [**2147-10-26**]

Date of Birth:   [**2074-9-4**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIAC ICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73-year-old
Russian male with no significant past medical history who
presents to the Emergency Department with new acute onset of
substernal chest pain of several hour duration with radiation
down the left arm.  Patient was reportedly in his usual state
of health when he reports acute onset of left arm pain
associated with "pins and needles" sensation while at rest.
The patient's arm pain persisted for approximately 30 minutes
before onset of substernal chest pain and pressure.  The
chest pain progressively worsened over several hours with
associated nausea and diaphoresis.  The patient denies
shortness of breath, pleuritic pain, palpitations, as well as
lightheadedness.  The patient was transported to the
Emergency Department by EMS and on route was treated with
aspirin and sublingual nitroglycerin with persistent chest
pain.

On arrival to the Emergency Department, the patient was
started on nitroglycerin drip, heparin, Plavix, and
Integrilin (Lopressor was held secondary to sinus
bradycardia).  In the Emergency Department, the patient was
found to be afebrile with a blood pressure of 114/68, heart
rate 52, and oxygen saturation 93% on room air, 97% on four
liters nasal cannula.  The patient's initial
electrocardiogram demonstrated antero-septal ST elevations
with persistent chest pain.  The patient was sent for
emergent cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Anxiety disorder.
2.  Degenerative joint disease.
3.  History of gout.
4.  Status post inguinal hernia repair.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Paxil (dose unknown).
2.  Diazepam (dose unknown).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married and lives with his
wife.  The patient is a retired mechanical engineer and
emigrant from [**Country 532**].  The patient has a 30 pack year tobacco
history with reported occasional alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No significant coronary artery disease or
diabetes reported.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 98.6.  Heart rate
71.  Blood pressure 115/67.  Respiratory rate 20.  Oxygen
saturation 95% on three liters nasal cannula.  In general,
patient is a well-developed, well-nourished elderly male
lying flat in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat exam:  Normocephalic, atraumatic, anicteric sclera,
extraocular movements intact bilaterally.  Pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light and accommodation, clear
oropharynx, moist mucous membranes.  Neck with 2+ carotid
pulses bilaterally, no jugular venous distention, supple, no
lymphadenopathy appreciated.  Cardiovascular exam:  Distant
heart sounds, regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or
gallops appreciated.  Pulmonary exam:  Clear to auscultation
bilaterally anteriorly with no wheezes, rhonchi or rales.
Abdominal exam:  Soft, normal active bowel sounds, nontender,
nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  No
cyanosis, clubbing or edema, 2+ distal pulses throughout,
right groin with arterial and venous catheterization sheaths
with small hematoma (marked) with pressure dressing, no bruit
appreciated.

LABORATORY AND STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  CBC with a white blood
cell count of 9.8, hematocrit 44.6, platelet count 301,000.
Chem-7 with sodium of 139, potassium 4.3, chloride 104,
bicarbonate 20, BUN 16, creatinine 1.0, glucose 153.  Cardiac
enzymes:  First set:  CK 90, MB not done, troponin I 1.6.
Second set:  CK 4396, CK-MB 613, troponin I greater than 50.
Third set:  CK 2759, CK-MB 299, troponin I greater than 50.
Chest x-ray on admission showed no overt failure, no
infiltrate appreciated.  Initial electrocardiogram:  Normal
sinus rhythm at 86, right bundle branch block with
intraventricular conduction delay, left axis deviation, [**Street Address(2) 28585**] elevations in V2 and V3, [**Street Address(2) 1766**] elevations in leads V4
and V5, Q waves in V2 through V5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a cardiac
catheterization without complication.  Catheterization
demonstrated a right dominant system with multivessel disease
including mildly diseased left circumflex, moderate (40-50%)
occluded right coronary artery, 20% left main occlusion, and
total occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending
artery.  Right heart pressures were elevated with a right
atrial pressure of 9, right ventricular pressures of 34/16,
pulmonary artery pressures of 36/17 and pulmonary capillary
wedge pressure of 18.  The patient underwent Angio-jet to the
left anterior descending artery with placement of three
stents.  0% residual was reported post stent placement,
however, "no reflow" was seen.  The patient was subsequently
treated with intra-coronary adenosine, diltiazem, and
nitroglycerin with subsequent TIMI 3 flow.  The patient was
started on Integrilin (18 hours), Plavix, aspirin, and
transferred to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit.

The patient ruled in for an ST elevation anterior wall
myocardial infarction with peak CK of 4396.  The patient was
started on low dose beta-blocker and ACE inhibitor with low
normal blood pressure, well-tolerated.  The patient remained
chest pain free during the remainder of the hospital course.
The patient also remained in normal sinus rhythm on telemetry
without signs of arrhythmia.  A post myocardial infarction
echocardiogram demonstrated severely decreased systolic
function with an ejection fraction of 20-30%, severe
hypokinesis of the inferior and anterior septum, as well as
anterior free wall, and extensive apical akinesis.  The
echocardiogram also demonstrated mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy, mild pulmonary hypertension, 1+
tricuspid regurgitation, and 1+ mitral regurgitation.  No
thrombus was seen on echocardiogram and the patient was
started on anticoagulation for akinetic/poor left ventricular
function with heparin and Coumadin, goal INR [**1-1**].  There was
no evidence of bleeding, complication or groin hematoma.  The
patient's lipid panel demonstrated a total cholesterol of
172, elevated LDL of 124, low high density lipoprotein of 25,
and triglycerides of 114.  The patient was started on a
statin (LFTs only remarkable only for an elevated AST likely
secondary to cardiac origin).

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Anterior wall myocardial infarction.
2.  Ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of
20-30%.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Anxiety disorder.
5.  Degenerative joint disease.
6.  Gout.
7.  Status post inguinal hernia repair.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg po q.d.
2.  Lopressor 12.5 mg po b.i.d.
3.  Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous b.i.d. (until INR
therapeutic).
4.  Coumadin 5 mg po q.h.s. (dosed by INR level).
5.  Plavix 75 mg po q.d. (total of 30 days).
6.  Aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
7.  Lipitor 10 mg po q.d.

INSTRUCTIONS ON DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged to
home with instructions to follow-up with his primary care
physician/cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3357**], on Monday, [**10-30**] at
10 a.m.  Patient was prescribed Lovenox, quantity sufficient
for four days until next blood work and INR level.  The
patient was instructed to follow-up with [**Hospital1 **] Cardiology on [**11-14**] for further risk
stratification including a T wave alternans test in the
stress laboratory, a signal average electrocardiogram, and 24
hour Holter monitor.  The risk stratification is part of an
ongoing Electrophysiology study for potential placement of
ICD.
