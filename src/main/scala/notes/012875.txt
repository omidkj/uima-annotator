Brief Hospital Course:
1. GIB - stablilized hct between ED and MICU as above.  Pt
subsequently underwent EGD which revealed 2 cratered ulcerations
that were not bleeding. She continued to have melanotic stools
on day of discharge. However her HCT remained stable. It was
decided that the patient would no longer be hospitalized and
that further procedures were not in keeping with her wishes so
no action was taken.

2. FTT - son has [**Name2 (NI) 97133**] PEG tube for route of administration
of tube feedings should she not tolerate oral feedings at home
as planned.  PEG tube placed by GI without complication.
However, on day of discharge, there was some oozing around the
site of the tube. This was stopped with application of silver
nitrate.

3. FEN - Was fluid overloaded with pulmonary edema after
aggressive resuscitation on presentation for hemodynamic
stabilization.  Responded very well to lasix, diuresing over the
last 2 days of the hospitalization.  Lytes were repleted prn.
After placement of the PEG tube, she was started on free water
boluses of 250 cc q 4 hours for fluid maintenance at a
restriction of 1.5 L given her recent pulmonary edema.  No
tubefeedings were started after the PEG tube was placed since
her son was hoping to encourage PO intake.

After several meetings with the palliative care service, the
patient went home with her son and [**Name (NI) 269**] care. A decision had been
made to avoid further hospitalizations and procedures since the
patient would not want aggressive interventions in the face of
her end stage dementia.
