History of Present Illness:
49 year old male with AIDS (last CD4 17 when he initially
presented), off HAART and non-compliant, being transferred from
[**Hospital 12017**] [**Hospital 71377**] Hospital for further management of
intracranial masses and seizure. Recent history includes a
duodenal perforation with resultant polymicrobial liver abscess
in [**2154-12-22**] that was treated and resolved. He presented to
[**Location (un) 12017**] Regional on [**11-19**] with progressive gait unsteadiness,
headache, and seizures; CT/MRI at the time showed multiple
subcortical ring enhancing lesions, most prominently in the
right parietal region, with some associated edema. He was
started on sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine for presumed
toxoplasmosis treatment, as well as dilantin for seizures, but
did not improve. He had an LP on [**11-21**] which showed 6 RBC, 8 WBC
(31% PMN, 48% lymphs, 21% monos), with a protein of 48 and
glucose of 57. Bacterial cultures were negative, as were other
more specific microbial studies (see below). Decadron was added.
The patient's confusion worsened, necessitating change from
sulfadiazine to clindamycin so that it could be administered IV.
Interestingly, toxoplasmosis IgG and IgM antibodies returned
negative, in addition to CSF toxo PCR. An extensive workup for
potential malignancy was undertaken, including CT torso
(negative) and colonoscopy given an elevated CEA of 14.2 (also
unrevealing).
.
The patient's right sided weakness improved, though he had
ongoing right sided incoordination. He also had a mild left 7th
cranial nerve palsy. A repeat MRI on [**12-3**] showed further
progression of the mass lesions. Neurosurgery was involved, and
ultimately proceeded to brain biopsy on [**12-7**] via left parietal
craniotomy. The aspiration revealed purulent material, however
cultures have remained negative. Cytology did not demonstrate
malignant cells. Due to concern for pyogenic abscess, meropenem
was initiated at this point ([**12-8**]). Dexamethasone was
discontinued following the surgery, and he remained seizure free
during the hospitalization.
.
He had a fever to 100 on [**12-13**] at which point metronidazole was
added. On [**12-14**] he began developing difficulty with nausea and
vomiting, and diarrhea. C. Diff assay was negative. He was more
lethargic and mildly hypoxic, in addition to increasing
confusion and hallucinations. Blood and urine cultures were
obtained on [**12-15**] when he spiked to 101.3. MRI was repeated,
demonstrating progressive enlargement of his subcortical
lesions, as well as a pontine lesion and apparent new medullary
lesion. Dexamethasone was resumed at this point (had been d/c'ed
on [**12-8**]). Clindamycin and meropenem were discontinued at this
point in favor of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 5 mg/kg IV Q 12
hours for possible PCP (?). Vancomycin was added as well. A TTE
was undertaken which demonstrated calcification of the chordae
of the anterior mitral valve leaflet, without being able to
exclude a vegetation. Subsequently, both sets of blood cultures
from [**12-15**] revealed gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. Two
sets obtained earlier on the same day remain without growth.
Blood cultures from [**11-22**] and [**11-19**] are also no growth to date.
.
Of note, he was started on HAART during this hospitalization on
[**12-10**] after CD4 count noted to be 17, and genotyping was sent
(pending at the time of dishcarge).
.
Currently, he denies pain.


Past Medical History:
1) AIDS: CD4 nadir at 45 in [**2146**], but now found to be 17 at
[**Location (un) 12017**]. Only opportunistic infection previously was thrush.
Prior to this admission was on Kaletra, tenofovir, and abacavir.
CD4 count in [**2154-5-22**] was 218, VL > 100,000 copies - was just
resuming HAART at that time after a long self-imposed drug
holiday.
2) Esophageal candidiasis
3) Alcohol abuse, history of pancreatitis and alcohol withdrawal

4) Diverticulitis, with history of diverticular abscess in
[**2154-10-22**]. Treated with percutaneous drainage and
antibiotics.
5) Duodenal perforation with E. Coli bacteremia and hepatic and
intraabdominal abscesses in [**2154-12-22**]. Hepatic abscess grew
E. coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, bacteroides [**Last Name (LF) 71378**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
albicans, prevotella, and saccharomyces. Intraabdominal abscess
grew [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10577**]. Treated with ertapenem and ambisome
(developed neutropenia while on caspofungin).
6) Onychomycosis


Social History:
Has not worked in eight years because of his disease. Previously
smoked 1 PPD for years until recently. As above, history of
alcohol abuse. Lives with his partner. Acquired AIDS presumably
via sexual intercourse with men. Has a pet cat at home.


Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: 98.8, 114/87, 83, 20, 90% on 2L.
GENERAL: Mildly uncomfortable appearing caucasian male.
MS: Patient knows he's in [**Location (un) 86**], not sure which hospital. The
date is "[**12-15**]."
HEENT: Moist mucous membranes. Right eye slightly ptotic.
COR: RR, normal rate, no murmurs.
LUNGS: Upper airway congestion making auscultation difficult.
ABDOMEN: Normoactive bowel sounds, distended and mildly tense
but non-tender.
EXTR: Right lower extremity with 1+ pedal edema, much cooler
than left. PT pulse palpable.
NEURO: CN VII palsy on the left, appears to be central. Pupils
equal. Slight right ptosis. Tongue midline. Strength 5/5 on the
left. [**3-25**] right upper extremity extensors but [**1-26**] biceps
flexion. [**2-23**] right lower extremity foot dorsiflexion.


Pertinent Results:
Head:
[**2155-12-16**]: MRI head: Multiple rim-enhancing lesions with slow
diffusion in the center are suggestive of infectious etiology
and favor toxoplasmosis over lymphoma. Mild surrounding edema is
seen without midline shift or hydrocephalus.
[**2156-1-20**]: MRI/A head: Interval decrease in size of multiple
cerebral and brainstem lesions consistent with abscesses.
Unchanged tiny left occipital subdural hematoma.
[**2156-3-10**]: MRI head: There has been no significant interval change
since the most recent comparison study of [**2156-2-12**]. Again
demonstrated are small ring-enhancing lesions involving the left
superior cerebellar peduncle and right corona radiata, measuring
5 mm and 10 mm respectively, not significantly changed. Two
faint foci of enhancement, one in the left frontal lobe and the
second in the right parietal lobe just superior and posterior to
the central sulcus are also unchanged. No new enhancing lesions
are appreciated. There remains a small amount of edema relating
to several of these lesions, most prominently the lesion in the
right corona radiata, also unchanged.
.
Torso:
[**2155-12-20**]: CT torso:
1. Diffuse lung abnormalities likely diffuse lung injury from
developing ARDS. Pulmonary edema is a consideration and diffuse
infectious etiology such as PCP cannot be entirely excluded.
2. High-grade small bowel obstruction with likely transition
point involving the distal jejunum in the right pelvis. No
evidence of free air, abscess, or pneumotosis.
[**2156-1-6**]: CT abd/pelvis:
1. Relatively large abscess in the lower abdomen. This abscess
cavity is located between the sigmoid colon and the bladder.
2. Diffuse thickening of the cecum and ascending colon and
sigmoid colon. This might be secondary to intraabdominal
infection. Followup of this area after resolution of infection
is recommended.
3. Unchanged appearance of diffuse ground glass opacities of
both lungs.
[**2156-2-3**]: CT abd/pelvis:
1. Extraluminal oral contrast is present surrounding the sigmoid
colon, which indicates the presence of at least another
fistulous tract in addition to
