Service:  Cardiology

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 46195**] is a 59-year-old
woman with a history of asthma and rheumatoid arthritis who
developed nonradiating pressure-like chest pain and became
diaphoretic after she returned home from work.  She also
developed nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and the chest pain
was not relieved by albuterol.

Evaluation at an outside hospital revealed electrocardiogram
changes including ST segment elevations in II, III, and aVF.
She was given nitroglycerin which resolved some of her pain.
She had one episode of atrial fibrillation that was converted
with digoxin.  Ms. [**Known lastname 46195**] was subsequently transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac
catheterization.  The results included a depressed ejection
fraction with severe inferolateral and inferior hypokinesis.
Left main coronary artery was 50% at origin, 40% distal left
main.  The left anterior descending artery was 80% focal
middle left anterior descending artery.  The left circumflex
was 80% origin.  The right coronary artery was successfully
reperfused with earlier thrombolytic with a large 70% middle
right coronary artery lesion and 50% origin posterior
descending artery.

Given these results, Ms. [**Known lastname 46195**] was then evaluated for
cardiac surgery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Asthma.
2.  Rheumatoid arthritis.
3.  Breast cancer, status post radical mastectomy.
4.  Hiatal hernia times two.
5.  Hysterectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Singulair, clonidine, albuterol,
and Mobic.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Ms. [**Known lastname 46195**] does not smoke, and she is a
social drinker.

FAMILY HISTORY:  She had three brothers with myocardial
infarctions at the ages of 34, 62, and 60.  Her mother had
diabetes mellitus.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   Review of systems revealed no other
episodes of chest pain.  No previous episodes of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, dyspnea on exertion, edema,
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or hyperlipidemia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed vital signs with a pulse of 99, blood pressure
was 150/81, respiratory rate was 20, oxygen saturation was
96% on 2 liters.  Ms. [**Known lastname 46195**] is a 59-year-old woman in no
apparent distress.  Her pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Her extraocular
movements were intact.  Her neck was supple with no jugular
venous distention.  Her heart was rapid with occasional
premature ventricular contractions.  Her lungs were positive
for rhonchi but with good air movement.  Her abdomen was
soft, nontender, and nondistended, with normal active bowel
sounds.  She had trace edema in the lower extremities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 46195**] was taken to the operating room
on [**2158-8-10**] for a coronary artery bypass graft times
five.  Grafts included left internal mammary artery to first
diagonal and AOA, saphenous vein graft to first obtuse
marginal, and saphenous vein graft to posterior descending
artery and RPL.

The operation was performed without complications, and
Ms. [**Known lastname 46195**] was subsequently transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit.  Following the operation, Ms. [**Known lastname 46195**] developed
hypertension with a decreased hematocrit for which she was
treated with 2 units of packed red blood cells.  Following
transfusion, Ms. [**Known lastname 46195**] was more stable.  She was extubated
later on postoperative day one.  Her drips were weaned, and
she was hemodynamically monitored.

She continued to improve and was transferred to the floor on
postoperative day four.  Ms. [**Known lastname 46195**] made an uneventful
recovery while on the Cardiology Surgical floor.  Her pain
was under control pain medications.  She was tolerating an
oral diet and ambulating well with Physical Therapy.

She was subsequently felt stable for discharge on
postoperative day five.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE:  Physical examination on
discharge evaluated vital signs with a temperature of 98.4,
pulse was 74, blood pressure was 113/68, respiratory rate
was 20, oxygen saturation was 94% on room air.  Heart was
regular in rate and rhythm.  The lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender,
and nondistended, with normal active bowel sounds.
Extremities were remarkable for trace edema.  Her incision
was clean, dry, and intact; and she appeared well.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Montelukast 10 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Docusate 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
4.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. (times five days).
5.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. q.d. (times five days).
6.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
7.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q.4-6h. as needed for
pain.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:   Ms. [**Known lastname 46195**] should follow up with
