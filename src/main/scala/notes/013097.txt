History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 22M who fell down 3 steps approximately 5-6
weeks ago, falling onto his R-sided back. He did not seek
medical
attention at that time. However, a week and a half later, due to
increasing pain, he went to his local ED where he was diagnosed
with R-sided rib fractures, given pain medications, and sent
home. His pain did not subside within a few days so he presented
to his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] reassured him and gave him more pain medications
and again discharged him home.

Earlier today, he presented to [**Hospital6 204**] seemingly
septic with fevers, tachycardia with HR in the 140s-150s and
leukocytosis of 20. He was also hyponatremic with a Na of 126.
CTA performed at LGH showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates
that
appeared continuous with a >10cm x 9cm multiloculated fluid
collection that seems to extend in the RP space posterior to the
R hepatic lobe and upper pole of the R kidney. This fluid
collection also extends into the lower chest wall between the
10/11th and 11/12th ribs. He was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management. He received 2L NS and ceftriaxone at
LGH.
Here in our ED he has so far received 2 more liters of
crystalloid and has been dosed with vanc/zosyn.


Past Medical History:

hemachromatosis but biopsy was negative


Social History:
[**1-2**] alcoholic drinks/week; denies tobacco or illicit drugs


Family History:
non contributory

Physical Exam:
Temp 100.8, HR 163, BP 122/73, R 25, 100% on 2L NC
GEN - diaphoretic but NAD, calm, awake/alert, cooperative
CVS - tachycardic, regular
PULM - diminished over bilateral bases; there is a very large,
prominent hump over his right back beneath his scapula that is
fluctuant and tender, no obvious ecchymosis
ABD - soft, nondistended with mild tenderness in the R
subcostal/RUQ region; no rebound or guarding

[**2163-8-14**] CT Torso :
1. Large, 26 x 14 x 10 cm multiloculated, partially liquefied,
partially
solid fluid collection involving the right paravertebral soft
tissues of the mid and lower thoracic spine, the posterobasal
segment and pleural space of  the lower lobe of the right lung,
the right posterior pararenal space and the  right iliopsoas
muscle.
2. Differential diagnosis includes superinfected hematoma or
frank abscess, possible actinomycosis or tuberculosis given the
aggressive and destructive nature of the collection.

[**2163-8-14**]
Technically successful placement of 10 French Flexima
biliary-type catheter into the retroperitoneal and subcutaneous
fluid collection as described. A total of 620 cc of bloody and
purulent aspirate was removed, and specimen sent for analysis

[**2163-8-18**] CT Abd/pelvis :
1. Marked reduction in size of previously seen large
multiloculated fluid
collection involving the right paravertebral soft tissues of the
mid and lower thoracic spine status post drain placement. Areas
of hypodensity within the posterobasilar segment of the right
lower lobe are still seen, although these too have decreased in
size.
2. Gynecomastia.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated by the Acute Care service in the
Emergency Room and scans were reviewed.  They were suboptimal
and it was unclear the delineation
of the fluid collection from the sub-diaphragm that was
extending to the right perinephric area but does not appear to
be intrathoracic.  The Thoracic surgery team also consulted and
agreed.  He was relatively unstable in the ER with tachycardia
to 150 and was diaphoretic due to sepsis and was therefore
admitted to the SICU for further resuscitation and management.
He was transfused with 2 units of packed red cells for a
hematocrit of 26 and his blood pressure remained stable.  His
tachycardia soon resolved and he then underwent another  CT scan
to further delineate the fluid collection and eventually the
retroperitoneal collection was drained. About 600cc of bloody,
purulent fluid was drained and the initial gram stain was
polymicrobial.  He felt much better following drainage and was
covered with IV Cipro, Flagyl and Vancomycin pending culture
results.

He was transferred to the Surgical floor on [**2163-8-16**] and
continued to make good progress.  He was draining about
200cc/day from the drain which slowly tapered.  He remained
afebrile and his WBC decreased from 25K on admission to 12K 3
days post drainage.  He was afebrile, tolerating a regular diet
and walking independently.  A repeat CT scan was obtained on
[**2163-8-18**] to assure the collection was fully drained and he had
marked improvement although there was a hypodense area in the
posterior post ion of the right lower lobe that potentially
could be drained.  He went back to Interventional Radiology on
[**2163-8-19**] and......

Of note he had some elevated blood sugars during this admission
which was presumed to be from sepsis.  He mentioned that he was
told in the past that he may be a diabetic but never sought
further treatment.  Currently his father is arranging an
appointment for him with a doctor on the [**Hospital1 189**] area for another
evaluation.


Medications on Admission:
none

Discharge Disposition:
Home with Service

Discharge Diagnosis:
Retroperitoneal abscess
Acute blood loss anemia
Pneumonia


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
* You were admitted to the hospital with a severe infection
probably due to a collection of blood that developed when you
fell, then became infected.
* You have improved with drainage of the collection and
antibiotics.
* You will be discharged with the drain in place so that the
area can continue to drain.  Check the site daily, empty the
drain 1-2 times a day and record the output.  Bring this record
with you to your first appointment so that the doctor can
determine if and when the drain should be removed.
* Continue your antibiotics as prescribed.
* If you develop any increased pain, fevers or a change in the
color of the drainage please call your do
