Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, increased work of breathing, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 60118**] is a 46yoF with a history of asthma (previously
intubated), HTN, HLD, and DM2 who was refferred to the ED by her
PCP for increased work of breathing, SOB, and cough similar to
her previous asthma exacerbations.
.
She was in her usual state of health until 5 days prior to
admission when she developed URI type symptoms including
coughing, nasal congestion, sore throat, malaise, and headache.
She then developed worsening shortness of breath requiring
around-the-clock albuterol inhalations through the present day.
Her PCP placed her on a course of azithromycin and had suspicion
for viral sinusitis. She had completed 4/5 days of azithromycin
without significant improvement of her respiratory function.
When symptoms persisted today, she again presented to the [**Location (un) 2274**]
acute care clinic, who promptly referred her to the ED for
increased WOB and tachypnea to the 30s.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T99 P122 BP166/91 R 100%NRB. EKG
showed only sinus tachycardia. CXR was without acute
cardiopulmonary process. She was aggressively treated with nebs,
125mg IV solumedrol, heliox, and 500mg azithromcyin. BiPap was
attempted but poorly tolerated.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], her initial VS were T99.4 P130 BP157/72
100%RA. Her respiratory status had greatly improved. She was
speaking in full sentences, though coughing periodically. On
review of systems, she notes intermittent diarrhea since the
onset of her symptoms. She vomited once today without lingering
nausea. No chest pain or pressure, abdominal pain, constipation,
bloody stools, dysuria, hematuria, anxiety symptoms, myalgias or
arthralgias.

Discharge Labs:

EKG: sinus tachycardia

Imaging:
CXR [**2171-7-24**]: Lung volumes are diminished. There is mild
respiratory motion obscuring the hemidiaphragms at the lung
bases. The previously noted right perihilar consolidation has
resolved in the interval. No definite new consolidation is
evident. The mediastinum and cardiac silhouette are distorted by
low lung volumes and AP technique but are otherwise grossly
stable. No effusion or pneumothorax is noted. The osseous
structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Resolved right pneumonia. Low lung volumes with
limitations above. No gross consolidation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 60118**] is a 46yo female asthmatic here with progressive
dyspnea concerning for an acute exacerbation of asthma triggered
by likely viral URI/sinusitis that improved with nebs,
antibiotics, and steroids.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS:
1. ACUTE ASTHMA EXACERBATION:  Her increased chest tightness,
coughing, and shortness of breath are consistent with an acute
exacerbation of asthma, which was likely triggered by a viral
upper respiratory infections several days prior to admission.
Her blood gas showed adequate oxygenation and ventilation, and
her CXR lacked the typical hyper-expanded appearance of an
air-trapping acute asthmatic, which were both reassuring. There
was no evidence of pneumonia. She received 125mg IV
methylprednisolone, albuterol, azithromycin 500mg, heliox, and
oxygen in the ED. She was in minimal respiratory distress upon
arrival to the ICU from the emergency department and was
saturating 100% on room air with a clear pulmonary examination.
Because of her tremors and hypokalemia (see below) we held her
albuterol.  We switched to PO prednisone 40mg the morning
following admission, which she should continue to complete a 5
day steroid course.  She completed a five day azithromycin
course prior to discharge and required no further antibiosis due
to her clinical stability. Her outpatient regimen includes
advair and prn albuterol.  She was told to get in touch with her
doctor when she gets a URI and feels tight to try a possible
steroid burst to avoid hospitalization.

2. TREMULOUSNESS/HYPERTENSION/TACHYCARDIA:  She was tremulous
and tachycardic on arrival, which was likely due to
around-the-clock albuterol treatment over the past 5 days, with
a large amount of nebulized albuterol administered in the ED.
We held this drug with good effect, and instructed her to use it
only as needed as an outpatient.

3. HYPOKALEMIA: She presented with significant hypokalemia to
2.8 probably due to an intracellular shift from exogenous
beta-agonists and endogenous catecholamines from her respiratory
distress.  Her K normalized with gentle repletion and albuterol
withdrawal

4. DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2: She had very poor glycemic control
due to her steroids and generally poor dietary choices in house.
 She was covered with her home 20units lantus and a humalog
sliding scale.  Metformin was restarted on discharge.

INACTIVE PROBLEMS
5. HYPERTENSION: Continued atenolol, lisinopril, and verapamil.
Atenolol may not be an optimal long-acting drug due to the
possibility of worsening bronchoconstriction.

6. ANXIETY: gave low-dose ativan prn
