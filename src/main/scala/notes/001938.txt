Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiPap
Intubation, extubation ([**2154-4-13**])


History of Present Illness:
69 year old male with history of HIV (CD4 116 [**2154-4-8**]), COPD
(2-4L at home), DVT on coumadin, hypertension, chronic lower
back [**Last Name (un) 2187**], osteoporosis who presents with respiratory distress.
The patient had been recently admitted 5/13-16/[**2153**] for COPD
exacerbation and treated with nebs, azithromycin, prednisone
(slow taper). The patient presented to the ED on [**2154-4-2**] for
dyspnea but left AMA before admission. He was sent to the ED on
[**2154-4-8**] but left AMA again, with prednisone and azithromycin
prescriptions which he never filled. He had seen Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
pulmonary clinic yesterday and had been non-compliant with
prednisone taper. He endorsed "exhaustion" at the appointment
but was stable 93% on 3.5L nasal cannula. The patient had also
been at [**Hospital **] Clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2185**] prior to Pulmonary
appointment.
.
The patient re-presented to the ED today with worsening dyspnea
and was brought in by EMS in respiratory distress (enroute CO2
50). He responded to nebulizers enroute and arrived looking very
uncomfortable, using accessory muscles. He was tight on
pulmonary exam with minimal breath sounds and speaking few word
sentences. The patient was started on BiPap (50%, PSV 15, PEEP
5), which he tolerated well. He was briefly weaned off to 4L NC
but decompensated, tripoding despite Methylprednisolone 125mg IV
X1, Azithromycin 500mg, more nebulizers and ativan 2mg IV.
.
ROS: Patient denies fevers/chills, nausea/vomiting, myalgias,
changes in bowel movement or urination.

.
CXR [**4-9**]:
Patchy opacity in left lung base, similar to the prior study,
which remains concerning for infection. Severe emphysema.
.
CXR [**4-13**]:
An endotracheal tube lies at the level of the
clavicular heads, appropriately positioned. A nasogastric tube
courses into the stomach. Severe emphysema is noted. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There are small
bilateral pleural effusions. The left lower lobe opacity has
mildly improved and reflects resolving infection. No new focal
consolidation is appreciated.
.
Discharge Labs:
None

Brief Hospital Course:
69 year old male with history of HIV (CD4 116 [**2154-4-8**]), COPD
(2-4L at home), DVT on coumadin, hypertension, chronic lower
back [**Last Name (un) 2187**], osteoporosis who presents with respiratory distress.

.
# Respiratory Distress: Most likely due to ongoing COPD
exacerbation. Trigger unclear given lack of pneumonia on initial
CXR, no fevers/chills, productive cough. Patient has been
non-compliant with medications, however, since discharge; this
includes prednisone and antibiotics. ?compliance with nebulizers
and has supplemental O2 at home. The patient has had CTA
recently to rule out pulmonary emboli given ongoing dyspnea
despite therapy. He was treated with azithromycin for 5 days and
methylprednisolone. He intermittently required BiPap. A plan was
made to use bipap at night once the patient was able to leave
the ICU. However on the morning of [**4-13**] patient was anxious,
tachypneic and desatted and required intubation.  The patient
was extubated on [**4-14**]. He did well overnight but subsequently
had further respiratory distress and his steroids were increased
to full burst.  He ultimately decided to be DNR/DNI and came to
the understanding that he wasn't going to get better; the
patient decided to become CMO and was discharged to home hospice
after discussing with Palliative Care in-house.
- Continue long steroid taper at home (Prednisone 60mg X 7 days,
40mg X 7 days, 20 mg X7 days, 10mg X 7 days, off)
- Continue supplemental oxygen, albuterol and ipratropium nebs
- Continue MS contin and morphine liquid PRN for air hunger,
shortness of breath
- Continue lorazepam PRN for air hunger, shortness of breath,
anxiety
.
# HIV: Down trending CD4 count, ?due to acute illness. Continued
abacavir, lamivudine, fosamprenavir, and atazanavir. Continued
Bactrim SS daily. Patient does have history of Bactrim needing
to be held in [**10/2153**] for bone marrow suppression. The need for
ongoing HAART medication and PCP prophylaxis was discussed with
the patient. It was felt that he likely will not succumb to
HIV/AIDS or an opportunistic infection before he succumbs to his
end-stage COPD. However, taking these medications are not a
hardship for the patient and he would prefer not to risk
increasing HIV viral load and chance of opportunistic infection,
especially in the setting of ongoing steroids.
- The patient will be discharged home on hospice with
continuation of his HAART medications and Bactrim PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].
.
# DVT: LENI the day prior to admission as outpatient was
negative for DVT. Patient has been therapeutic and followed by
[**Hospital3 **] here at [**Company 191**]. He missed several doses of
Coumadin in the settting of being on Bipap and developed a
subtherapeutic INR. He was bridged with Lovenox. Anticoagulation
held [**4-13**] for concern for GIB but coumadin was resumed when hct
was stable for 24 hrs. Upon discharge home with hospice,
however, anticoagulation was discussed with the patient. As he
had a DVT in [**2152-3-17**] and ultimately completed treatment but was
continued given his sedentary/immobile nature, the indication
for ongoing anticoagulation and risk of DVT/PE is not high.
- Given this information, the patient chose to be discharged off
of coumadin. His primary care provider and the [**Name9 (PRE) 191**]
anticoagulation nurses were informed of his decision, and the
fact that he no longer needs INR checks.
.
#GIB: Patient noted to have guaic positive stool. T+S sent, PPI
started, PICC placed, transfused 1 unit of blood but did not
bump appropriately, so given 2nd unit. Hct then increased
appropriately and remained stable.
- PPI was stopped gi
