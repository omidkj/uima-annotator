RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS  [**2172-10-3**] 11:34 AM

CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS; CTA NECK W&W/OC & RECONS

Reason: trauma - ? carotid canal injury - PLEASE SCAN NECK TOO
Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
40 year old woman s/p ejection from high speed moving car with
SAH and extensive cranial fractures
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
trauma - ? carotid canal injury - PLEASE SCAN NECK TOO
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: 40-year-old woman with ejection from a high-speed
motor vehicle accident, subarachnoid hemorrhage and extensive
cranial fractures. Evaluate for carotid canal injury.

TECHNIQUE: CT of the head was performed.

FINDINGS: There is a right frontal ventriculostomy catheter with
the tip in the third ventricle.

The non-contrast head CT again shows diffuse subarachnoid
hemorrhage and extensive cranial fractures as previously
described. Please refer to that report for discussion of these
findings.

On the CTA, there is no significant abnormality of the right
carotid artery within the carotid canal. However, the cavernous
segment of the internal carotid artery does appear slightly
narrowed compared to the right. It also appears slightly
narrowed relative to its middle cerebral artery branch segments.
In addition, at its anterior genu, there is a 2 mm hyperdensity
which may represent a tiny aneurysm. This could also represent a
small area of intramural contrast leakage, which would represent
a dissection. Confirmation of this finding could be obtained by
cerebral angiography. However, flow is present distally into the
middle and anterior cerebral artery branches.

The left internal carotid artery appears normal along its entire
segment. The vertebral arteries appear also normal as does the
basilar artery. The anterior, middle and posterior cerebral
arteries appear unremarkable. This study is somewhat limited due
to a large amount of venous phase contamination.

IMPRESSION: Slight narrowing of the right internal carotid
artery in its cavernous segment. Near the anterior genu, there
is a 2 mm area of contrast which could represent a small
intramural leak versus a small aneurysm. If an intramural leak
is present, this would be consistent with a dissection.
Evaluation with cerebral angiography would be needed to
distinguish these two findings.

The remainder of the intracranial circulation shows no evidence
of dissection or thrombosis.

CT CHEST W/CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST

Reason: eval for blunt injury, eval t/l/s spine
Field of view: 48 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
40 year old woman with [**Hospital 8751**] and head injury
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for blunt injury, eval t/l/s spine
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: 40-year-old woman status post MVC with severe head
trauma.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector axial images of the chest, abdomen and
pelvis were obtained with IV contrast. 120 cc Optiray. Coronal
and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.

CT CHEST: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are within
normal limits. There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar
lymphadenopathy. There is bibasilar atelectasis. Emphysematous
changes are noted in the lungs. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax. No pleural or pericardial effusions are
identified.

CT ABDOMEN: The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal
glands, kidneys, stomach, and bowel loops are unremarkable.
Nasogastric tube is identified. There is no free air or free
fluid. No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is
identified.

CT PELVIS: Foley catheter is inserted in the bladder. The
uterus, adnexa, sigmoid colon, and rectum are unremarkable.
There is no free fluid and no pelvic or inguinal
lymphadenopathy.

BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
lesions. No fractures are identified. The thoracic and lumbar
spine are normal in
appearance and alignment without evidence of fracture or
dislocation.

IMPRESSION: No acute injuries identified in the chest, abdomen,
and pelvis.

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2172-10-3**] 12:31 AM

CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST

Reason: eval for fx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
40 year old woman with [**Hospital 8751**] and head injury
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for fx
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

HISTORY: 40-year-old woman status post motor vehicle accident
and severe head trauma.

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector axial images of the cervical spine were
obtained without contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformatted
images were obtained.

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of cervical spine fracture or
abnormal alignment of the component vertebrae. Vertebral body
and disc heights are preserved. There are small amounts of
extramedullary blood tracking along the cervical cord. There is
no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. Emphysematous changes are
noted at the lung apices. Endotracheal and orogastric tubes are
noted.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of cervical spine fracture.
Extramedullary blood tracking along the cervical cord is
subarachnoid blood related to the patient's intracranial
hemorrhage.
