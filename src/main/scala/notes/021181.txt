Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1561**]
Chief Complaint:
recurrent esophageal adenocarcinoma

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2115-9-6**] esophagogastrectomy, jejunostomy, pylorplasty via left
thoracoabdominal approach
[**2115-9-30**] tracheostomy

History of Present Illness:
delightful 58-
year-old woman who approximately 2 years ago developed
esophageal cancer. Due to her obesity and comorbidities, it
was elected to treat her with definitive chemoradiotherapy
and not involve surgery. She did well for 2 years and then
recently developed a localized recurrence at the GE junction.
Intraesophageal ultrasound demonstrated the lesion to be a B2
recurrent lesion with no evidence of metastatic disease to
the lymph nodes. Metastatic workup showed no evidence of
metastasis. Given the fact that she has already had
radiotherapy for her esophagus, repeat radiotherapy was not
an option. Palliative chemotherapy was the only option other
than surgery. After many discussions, Ms. [**Known lastname 45074**] has decided
to go forward with the surgical resection. She understands
that this is an extremely risky procedure, given the fact
that it is a salvage esophagectomy several years after
chemoradiotherapy and her co-morbidities. Despite being
quoted a very high risk of mortality and morbidity, she has
elected to go forward with surgery.
Admitted to the TSICU after undergoing esophagastrectomy,
jejunostomy, and pylorplasty with j tube placement. Intraop the
patient received 6 liters of fluid to maintain hemodynamic
stability. She was also maintained on neosynephrine and levophed
throughout the case. She was transferred post-op to the TSICU
intubated, sedated, and on pressors.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT  [**2115-10-12**] 8:18 AM
Reason: S/P THORASIC SURGERY R/O DVT IN BOTH LOWER LIMBS

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
58 year old woman with s/p extensive thoracic and abdominal
surgery [**9-6**], obese, on lovenox at marginal tx level by Factor
10A levels, minimal activity , high risk for dvt
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please r/o dvt
HISTORY: Immobilized patient status post extensive thoracic and
abdominal surgery. Evaluate for deep venous thrombosis.

COMPARISON: No previous studies.

FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 867**] of the right and
left common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins
were performed. No intraluminal thrombus is identified. Normal
venous compressibility, color flow, waveforms, and augmentation
were demonstrated bilaterally.

IMPRESSION: No DVT in the right or left lower extremity.
   RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2115-10-10**] 10:31 AM
Reason: eval for line placement
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
58 year old woman s/p tracheostomy PICC line placement
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for line placement
INDICATION: 58-year-old woman status post tracheostomy and PICC
line placement.

COMMENTS: Portable semi-erect AP radiograph of the chest is
reviewed, and compared to previous study [**2115-10-7**].

The tip of the new left-sided PICC line is not clearly seen on
this radiograph. If clinically indicated, please obtain repeated
radiograph of the chest. On this radiograph, the tip of the
left-sided PICC line is probably in the left innominate vein,
which is still not certain.

The previously identified congestive heart failure has been
improving. There is continued marked cardiomegaly and tortuosity
of the thoracic aorta. The tracheostomy tube is seen in place.
The right subclavian IV catheter remains in place. No
pneumothorax is identified. There is continued bibasilar patchy
atelectasis. Focal opacity is noted in the right upper lobe
indicating asymmetric pulmonary edema versus superimposed
aspiration or pneumonia.
RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2115-10-7**] 3:13 PM
Reason: pneumonia?, new crackles on exam
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
58 year old woman s/p tracheostomy now new crackles on
auscultation
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
pneumonia?, new crackles on exam
INDICATION: Tracheostomy tube and new crackles on exam.

PORTABLE AP CHEST: As compared to [**10-6**], tracheostomy
tube and right subclavian central venous catheter remain in
stable position. Moderate-to- severe pulmonary edema is
unchanged. More confluent areas of opacity could represent
alveolar edema or pneumonia. Overall appearance is unchanged.

IMPRESSION: No significant interval change.
