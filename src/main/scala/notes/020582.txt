Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath / respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 81-year-old female with past medical history
significant for CAD, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes/type
2, and she is also status-post 6 vessel CABG done in [**2088**] which
included SVG to LAD, SVG to OMB, SVG to PDA and PLV, and SVG to
D1, SVG to LAD, and free LIMA graft from diagonal graft to LAD
per OSH records. She has a notable history of chronic
moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation as well. She explains
that she has been experiencing worsening fatigue and shortness
of breath with exertion over the past 2 months. She formerly was
able to walk 10 minutes on treadmill daily, but over past
several weeks, she has become fatigued with even walking 5
minutes. She experiences intermittent exertional shortness of
breath when climbing up a flight of 13 stairs in her home,
although this is not consistently reproducible. She denies
orthopnea or worsening lower extremity edema.
.
The patient stated she went to her PCP describing these symptoms
and was referred for an exercise MIBI on [**2103-8-15**] for additional
workup. The stress test was terminated after 6 mins secondary to
chest pain and fatigue and the patient had METS 5.8 and max HR
90 (65% max predicted HR) although her BP response was
appropriate. The patient describes her anginal chest pain as
mid-sternal with associated radiation at times to her shoulders
and back. Unable to elicit details of duration of chest
discomfort from stress test. No dysrhythmias noted. Stress test
recovery phase EKG showed 3mm ST depressions in V4-V6.
.
Given these above mentioned stress test results she was sent for
elective cardiac catheterization on [**2103-8-28**]. Four hours
post-procedure the patient had acute onset of shortness of
breath and agitation shortly after having a bowel movement. ECG
showed dynamic lateral ST segment depressions. Chest x-ray
demonstrated pulmonary edema. Patient was placed on CPAP and NTG
drip. She then became hypotensive to 85/57 per records and IV
nitroglycerin was discontinued. She received 80mg IV furosemide
with brisk 2.5 liter diuresis. Given the acute onset of symptoms
and ECG changes, heparin gtt was started and she was given ASA
325mg with Clopidogrel 600mg load for concern of ischemia/ACS.
At that time her CK was 55 and Troponins .07. Ms. [**Known lastname 19868**] was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible revascularization or
intervention for mitral regurgitation.

The CCU team felt that the patient had experienced an acute
coronary syndrome and then had new onset of congestive heart
failure and diastolic dysfunction in the setting of acute
ischemia. Clinically, the patient presented with shortness of
breath, increased baseline body weight, fatigue, pedal edema,
bibasilar crackles on lung exam and mild to moderate orthopnea.
CXR corroborated the patient's pulmonary congestion and her BNP
was elevated at 7908. The patient's progression to a CHF
exacerbation was likely multifactorial in nature. She had
reportedly been given pre-catheterization fluids for hydration
prior to having a new ischemic insult (NSTEMI) with sudden
increased myocardial oxygen demand. Moreover, the patient had
underlying moderate to severe mitral regurgitation which likely
contributed to her clinical decline and CHF exacerbation. The
patient's mitral regurgitation may have worsened secondary to
papillary muscle dysfunction in the setting of ischemia as well.

.
On additonal review of systems, she denied any prior history of
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. Cardiac review of systems was negative for PND, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
LABS/STUDIES:
.
[**2103-8-28**]: Pre-Cath Labs showed CK 55, Troponin .07
[**2103-8-28**] P.M. labs  CK 250 and MB index 13.2 (peak) Troponin 0.69
[**2103-8-29**] CK peaked at 609 and Troponin 2.15
.
[**2103-8-28**] EKG: rate 80, NSR, normal axis = 50 degrees, QRS
morphology w/ LVH in lateral leads, ST depressions noted in
V4-V6
[**2103-8-29**] EKG : Sinus rhythm. Left ventricular hypertrophy with
repolarization changes. Mild ST segment elevation in leads V1-V2
with biphasic T waves.
.
[**2103-8-28**] CARDIAC CATH:  Cardiac catheterization revealed total
occlusion of the left and right coronary artieries. LAD 100%
occluded proximally, RCA 100 % occluded mid-portion, LCX
100%proximally occluded . [**3-27**] bypass grafts were patent,
including SVG to PDA and PLV, a patent SVG to LAD, and patent
SVG to D1. SVG to OMB had 50-60% narrowing at mid-portion and a
high grade stenosis noted at distal section. Free LIMA grafted
from diagonal graft to LAD is now occluded.
.
[**2103-8-29**] : BILATERAL FEMORAL VASCULAR ULTRASOUND: There is mild
blunting of respiratory variation of flow within the left common
femoral vein of uncertain significance. Although this may be due
to compression of the left iliac vein, and therefore an expected
anatomic variation, if there is concern for left-sided venous
obstruction may consider additional studies.
Overall impression is no evidence of femoral AV fistula or
pseudoaneurysm.
The right femoral arterial and venous waveforms are normal.
There is no evidence of abnormal communication between venous
and arterial structures nor dilation of the femoral artery.
.
[**2103-8-29**]  CXR:  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.
Median sternotomy wires again seen. Slightly increasing
effusions are
identified bilaterally, right greater than left. Increasing
bibasilar
atelectasis also noted. No new focal consolidation identified.
.
[**2103-8-29**]  CT ABDOMEN IMPRESSION:
No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Bilateral pleural
effusions with probable right lower lobe atelectasis, please
note that pneumonia cannot be excluded in this setting.
Extensive atherosclerotic vascular disease including coronary
artery calcification and mitral annular calcification. Extensive
colonic diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
.
[**2103-8-29**]  CT PELVIS:  Uterus and adnexa appear unremarkable. No
pathologically enlarged lymph nodes, free fluid, or
retroperitoneal hem
