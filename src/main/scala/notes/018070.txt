History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with a history of hip fracture s/p mechanical
fall 1 week ago, s/p ORIF, course complicated by DVT and
subsequent IVC filter placement, just discharged on [**6-12**] to
rehab on coumadin, lovenox, and aspirin 325.  She initially
presented to OSH with a Hct of 15 from 30 on discharge two days
ago.  Her INR was 8.5.  She recieved 10 mg IV Vitamin K.  She is
Jehovah Witness and the son was refusing blood product or [**Name (NI) 9087**].
CT scan at OSH showed large right [**Name (NI) **] hematoma.  Patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.  In the ED, her
initial BPs were in the 70s/50s. Hct confirmed to be 15, INR had
decreased to 4.2. She received 5 L NS total, with pressures
improving to high 90s systolic.  A compression bag was placed on
the patient's [**Hospital1 **] per surgery recommendations.  Her urinalysis
was also positive so she was given a dose of ceftriaxone.  Per
discussion with family in the ED, patient made DNR/DNI.  On
transfer, vitals were 97/56 78 100%2LNC.

IMAGING:
[**2187-6-15**] CTA abdomen/pelvis:
1. Bilateral pulmonary emboli with small bilateral pleural
effusions.
2. No evidence for active extravasation.
3. Right [**Month/Day/Year **] hematoma, unchanged from comparison CT of
approximately one day prior.
4. Appropriately positioned inferior vena cava filter containing
trapped emboli.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman s/p ORIF for hip fracture one week ago, c/b
DVT with subsequent IVC filter placement, who presented with
hypotension, found to have a large right [**Age over 90 **] hematoma and new
PEs.
.
# Hypotension: Secondary to hypovolemic shock in the setting of
a HCT drop to 16.4 from 30 two days prior to admission. Patient
was discharged on lovenox and coumadin and had a
supratherapeutic INR (8.5 at OSH) on the day of admission. CTA
revealed a large right [**Age over 90 **] hematoma though no active
extravasation. She was administered vitamin K, amicar, DDAVP,
and over 10 liters of fluid resuscitation. A pressure dressing
was placed over her right [**Age over 90 **] to prevent further bleeding. She
is a Jehovah's Witness, so declined blood products. Hematology
and the blood bank were consulted regarding administration of
recombinant factor VII. This had a risk of arterial thrombi,
therefore after discussion with the patient's family, including
her daughter (HCP), the decision was made to not administer
recombinant factor VII. IR and surgery were consulted, however
it was felt that there was no surgical or interventional
procedure indicated. The family was made aware of the patient's
very poor prognosis and she was made DNR/DNI. Her HCT further
dropped to 11.8 and she had progressively worsening hypotension.
She passed away at 07:05 on [**2187-6-16**]. The medical examiner was
notified and is considering an autopsy.
.
# Urinalysis: UA with questionable UTI so the patient was given
a dose of ceftriaxone at the OSH. Given her hypotension and
shock, she was broadly covered with vanc and zosyn.
.
# PEs: Seen on abdominal/pelvic CTA. Given her bleeding, no
treatment was initiated.
