Admission Date:  [**2111-10-30**]       Discharge Date:  [**2111-11-8**]


Service:  Cardiac Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79 year old
male with no prior history of cardiac disease who awoke one
morning with new onset of chest pain.  The patient went to
[**Hospital **] [**Hospital 71903**] Medical Center on [**2111-10-27**] and
underwent transesophageal echocardiogram which revealed a
critical aortic stenosis with atrial valve area of 0.6 to 0.7
with peak gradient of 100.  The patient was also noted to
have a 2+ mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid regurgitation
and moderate left ventricular hypertrophy.  The patient was
then transferred to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 1559**] Medical Center for
cardiac catheterization and the patient was found to have 70%
stenosis of the left anterior descending, 3+ mitral
regurgitation and a calculated left ventricular ejection
fraction of 65%.  She was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for surgical evaluation.

The [**Hospital 228**] medical history is significant for
hypertension, gastric ulcer, remote history of nephropathy
and denies any cerebrovascular accidents, seizures or
transient ischemic attacks.

Surgical history is significant for cholecystectomy.

The patient denies any allergies to medications and his home
medications include Mavik 1.5 mg q.d. and Fosamax 10 mg q.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies using any cigarettes or
tobacco and occasionally drinks alcohol.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission reveals white
count of 8.8, hematocrit 39.3, platelets 284.  PT/PTT 12.2
and 26.9, INR of 1.0.  Chemistries sodium 138, potassium 4.3,
chloride 106, carbon dioxide 22, BUN 21, creatinine 1.1 and
glucose 84, AST 44, ALT 32, alkaline phosphatase 89 and
lipase 29 and LDH of 307.  Chest x-ray showed a faint opacity
of the left lingula, otherwise the chest fields were clear.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially received in the
Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit and the patient was ordered for
an echocardiogram to verify the results that were reported
from the outside hospital at our institution.  The patient
was found to have a severe aortic stenosis with an aortic
valve area of 0.6 and a peak velocity of 5.0.  The patient
was also noted to have a mild aortic regurgitation and a mild
mitral regurgitation, calculated ejection fraction graded at
55%.  Once it was verified that the patient was going to need
a atrial valve replacement and possible mitral valve
replacement and with the patient being stable, the patient
was transferred to the floor.  On [**2111-11-2**], the
patient underwent an aortic valve replacement #23
bioprosthetic tissue valve and a mitral valve ring
annuloplasty.  The patient also underwent a coronary artery
bypass with left internal mammary artery to the left anterior
descending.  Please see the operative report for further
details.  In the immediate postoperative period the patient
was transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit in
stable condition, still intubated and the patient is well
enough on postoperative day #1 to successfully be extubated
and was started on p.o. medications for diuresis and
heartrate control and was transferred to the floor at the end
of postoperative day #1.  The patient's chest x-ray on
postoperative day #2 showed a mild congestive heart failure
and the patient was diuresed with Lasix.  It was noted that
the patient's creatinine started to increase and peaked on
postoperative day #3 to 1.4, rising 0.3 from the preoperative
value of 1.1.  The patient was carefully diuresed with Lasix
and Captopril was discontinued.  The patient continued to do
well on the floor, ambulating with assistance and was
hemodynamically stable.  His postoperative pain was
adequately managed with p.o. medications.  The patient was
evaluated by physical therapy as per standard protocol and
post cardiac surgery.  The patient was able to walk with a
walker appropriately, however, to progress to his baseline
state of ambulation it was recommended the patient receive
home physical therapy and learn to use a walker in the
interim.  By postoperative day #6, the patient's vital signs
were stable, doing well on the floor and his creatinine has
stabilized to 1.2.  The patient was discharged to home with
[**Hospital6 407**] services and home physical
therapy.
