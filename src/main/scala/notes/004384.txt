REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 177**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: 1.0 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1 cm)

Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 1.0 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 4.8 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm)
Left Ventricle - Systolic Dimension: 4.0 cm
Left Ventricle - Fractional Shortening: *0.17 (nl >= 0.29)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 50% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Ascending: 3.2 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)
Aorta - Arch: 2.3 cm (nl <= 3.0 cm)
Aorta - Descending Thoracic: 2.5 cm (nl <= 2.5 cm)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal
interatrial septum. No
ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Low normal
LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Simple
atheroma in aortic
root. Normal ascending aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in
ascending
aorta. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic
arch. Normal
descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.


AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve
leaflets. No AS. Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. No MS. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results
were personally
post-bypass
data The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was
receiving
vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or
color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal (LVEF
50-55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. There are
simple atheroma in
the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation
is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving
phenylephrine by infusion.
1. Global left ventricular systolic function is normal. Right
ventricular
systolic function is normal.
2. Aorta is intact post decannulation
3. Other findings are unchanged

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted day of surgery. Taken to the OR for CABG X 4 and left
lung biopsy.  Please see OR report for details of operation.
Pt. extubated on POD # 1, due to some hypoxia.  He transferred
to the telemetry floor on POD # 2, was started on Beta blockers
and diuresis.  He had a brief episode of AFib post-op, but htis
was not sustained.  He has had some confusion, mostly in the
evenings, and has been given small doses of Haldol as needed
with good effect.  He has remained hemodynamically stable, and
continues to progress slowly from a mobility standpoint, and is
ready to be transferred to a rehab facility.
