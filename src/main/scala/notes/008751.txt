History of Present Illness:
This 75 y/o man with history of Afib on warfarin presented
after collapsing at home ~8pm.

He was in his USOH earlier today, visiting Foxwoods resort when,
on the way home ~1400h, he began mumbling.  As per his wife, he
was intelligible but his words were both slurred and his speech
was hypophonic.  He denied other symptoms including headache,
visual changess or focal weakness.  The mumbling speech
persisted
but the patient resisted his wife's request to be evaluated.  At
~2000h, his wife heard a dull thud in an adjacent room and came
upon the patient alert but mute and weak, leaning against the
wall.  There was no seizure activity noted or evident trauma.

EMS was contact[**Name (NI) **] and found RIGHT hemiplegia.  FSBS 156, SBP
200/P.  In the ER, the patient became briefly more alert, saying
"yes" and "no" but not to appropriate questions.

[**2123-6-30**] Phos 2.4 replenished with Neutra Phos

HCT - IMPRESSION:
1. Left temporal parenchymal hemorrhage.
2. Findings concerning for a pituitary mass. Further evaluation
with MR is
recommended.

ECHO - WNL NO shunting noted.
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus/mass is seen in
the body of the left atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.

CXR -  Since earlier today, ETT tip is 4.5 cm above the carina.
Nasogastric tube is in the stomach.
Moderate left pleural effusion with associated retrocardiac
alveolar opacity increased suggesting aspiration or atelectasis.
Vascular congestion
decreased. No other change since earlier today.

MRI-  IMPRESSION: Left posterior hematoma without signs of
underlying enhancement or abnormal vascular structures. Presence
of chronic microhemorrhages may suggest amyloid angiopathy but
follow up is recommended. Sellar abnormality noted

HCT - IMPRESSION:
1. No significant change in the large left posterior temporal
hemorrhage or debris of the mass effect. No new foci of
hemorrhage.
2. Stable appearance of the sella abnormality compared to
[**2115-12-19**].

[**2123-6-28**] ECG -
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Diffuse
non-specific
ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2123-6-25**]
atrial
fibrillation is new. However, the deep T wave inversions in the
lateral leads have partially normalized. Clinical correlation
and repeat tracing are suggested.





Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was initially admitted and cared for in the ICU. Pt was
intubated and extubated in the ICU. HCT, cardiac monitoring, MRI
obtained significant for possible amyloid angiopathy. Pt was
supertherapeutic on coumadin, INR 3.3 There seems to be no
traumatic antecedent. No mass or AVM in MRI.The absence of edema
makes me believe that there it is not a hemorhagic
transformation of infarct.  Pt was given FFP, Profilnine, and
vitamin K. Pt placed on a nicardipine drip. After nicardipine
drip and pt was extubated. Pt was transferred to the Step Down
unit and observed. Lisinopril, Atenolol was started and coumadin
was d/cd.
On [**2123-6-28**], he was started on ASA 81 mg PO daily. NGT placement
was attempted successfully. Overnight, SVT and afib noted and
treated with Diltizem and Lopressor. On [**2123-6-29**], pt passed the
speech and swallow eval and PO feeds restarted.  Pt monitored on
telemetry without tachyarrhytmias. Cardiology was consulted for
eval for "mini-maze" procedure given the fact that he is at high
risk for recurrent ICH if he were to resume coumadin. They felt
that he was not a good candidate.
Cognition, speech and sponateous movements improved.
