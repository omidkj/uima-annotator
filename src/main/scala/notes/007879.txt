Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname 3510**] [**Known lastname 15352**] is a very nice 52 year-old gentleman with
history of HTN, HL, CVA in [**2184**] with residual L-side weakness,
HIV on HAART with most recent CD4 of 442 and undetectable VL on
[**8-1**] who comes with productive cough and fever. He was in his
prior state of health until 2 days ago when he started noticing
productive cough with occasional bright red blood in his sputum.
He also has been having chills, rigors, but has not taken his
temperature at home. He has not noted any changes in the ammount
of activity he can do. He denies any history of travel or sick
contacts, has no pets at home and has been taking his
medications as prescribed, including his HIV regimen. He is
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who last checked his VL and CD4 ~4
months ago and were undetectable and 442 respectively (per
patient's report). His productive cough is now with dark-red
sputum.

In the ER his initial VS were 99.8 F, HR 76 BPM, BP 133/54 mmHg,
RR 20 breaths x'. He developed low SpO2 (not recorded) and was
placed on NRB. His breathing improved without any specific
therapy and they were able to wean him down to 4L NC, where he
is 93%. He had consolidation syndrome in the LLL and was
corroborated by CXR. He received 750 mg of levofloxacin x1 and
<500 cc of NS. His VS prior to transfer were: HR 82, BP 103/58,
SpO2 93% on 5L, RR 18.

Past Medical History:
#. Coronary artery disease, status post CABG with LIMA to the
LAD in [**2182**].
#.  Residual chronic systolic heart failure, with EF of 40%.
#.  Hypertension.
#.  Dyslipidemia.
#.  CVA believed to be hypertensive/hemorrhagic in [**2-/2185**] with
residual left-sided weakness.
#. HIV.  viral load was less than 48
copies.  His CD4 count is 442 and has been stable around 500
#. HCV genotype 1B; thought to be poor candidate for treatment
given CVD and HIV. Liver biopsies, one in [**2187**] and one in [**2193**]
with the later showing grade 1 inflammation with stage I-II
fibrosis. Liver USG [**2-2**] normal. Alpha fetoprotein was 3.9 back
in [**2195-2-22**]. Normal EGD in [**2192**].

IMAGING:

CXR [**2196-1-12**]: UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: There is a
consolidative opacity within the left lung base obscuring both
the hemidiaphragm and the left cardiac border, new from the
prior study. The right lung is grossly clear. The cardiac
silhouette is difficult to assess given the presence of the
consolidative process. The pulmonary vascularity is normal.
There is likely a left pleural effusion. No right pleural
effusion or pneumothorax is seen. IMPRESSION: Left basilar
consolidation, with probable small pleural effusion. Findings
are concerning for pneumonia, and a followup radiograph after
interval treatment is recommended to assess for interval
resolution.

Chest CT [**2196-1-16**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple opacities at the left lung base, concerning for
pneumonia. There is a small left pleural effusion.
2. No obstructing mass is present in the airways, although left
lower lobe bronchi are obscured by motion artifact.
3. Enlarged subcarinal lymph node, likely reactive.
4. Stones within a nondistended gallbladder.

Chest CT [**2196-1-19**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval progression of multifocal pneumonia with more
confluent opacities within the lingula, left lower lobe, and
right lower lobe. No residual pleural effusions. Slight
progression in adenopathy is also likely reactive, but can be
re-assessed on follow up exams once infection resolves.
2. Dilated pulmonary artery consistent with known severe
pulmonary hypertension (also noted on recent echo) which may HIV
induced. Unchanged cholelithiasis without any secondary signs of
acute cholecystitis.

Echocardiogram [**2196-1-19**]:
Poor image quality. The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thi
