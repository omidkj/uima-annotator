ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female
who called her life line on the day of admission secondary to
chest pain.  The patient reportedly had shortness of breath
or chest pain on the day of admission and was found to be
hypoxic on arrival to the Emergency Room with O2 saturations
of 79% on room air increasing to 88% on 6 liters increasing
to 94% on a nonrebreather.  At that time, she denied any
cough or shortness of breath to the primary team.  Patient
denied any fevers, chills, runny nose, sore throat, chest
pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constitutional, or dysuria.

Patient states that she has increasing fluid retention and
decreasing p.o. intake for the past two days before
admission.  Patient also admits sadness over her husband's
death and illness of her daughter in [**State 15946**], who was
recently diagnosed with cancer.  In the Emergency Room, the
patient was treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin, 20 mg
of IV Lasix x2, Tylenol, and nitro paste.  Patient's oxygen
saturations improved on 2 liters nasal cannula with more than
600 cc in the Foley bag.

defects on the [**2144**] stress test.
3. Carcinoid with chronic diarrhea.

5. Left hip fractures status post ORIF.
6. Hypothyroidism.
7. Parkinson's.
8. Total abdominal hysterectomy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is widowed and lives in [**Hospital3 5673**] and has VNA, home aide, and psych VNA.  Patient has
two daughters in [**Name (NI) 1456**] and [**State 15946**], five grandchildren.
Patient denies any smoking, alcohol, or drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature was
101.5, 103.3, blood pressure was 158/72, ranging
135/60-198/91, heart rate was 88, ranging 97-114, respiratory
rate was 28, and O2 saturation was 97% on 2 liters.  General:
The patient was awake, alert, and oriented times three in no
apparent distress with a blunt affect.  HEENT:  PERRL.
Mucous membranes moist.  EOMI, no lymphadenopathy.  JVD was
present to the ear.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate, 2/6
systolic ejection murmur.  Lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally with crackles at the bases bilaterally and
decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.
Tachypneic.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, and nondistended,
positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No clubbing or
cyanosis, +2 dorsalis pedis pulses, ankle edema left greater
than right.  Neurologic:  Cranial nerves II through XII are
intact.  Good strength and sensation throughout.

PERTINENT ADMISSION LABORATORIES:  Creatinine was stable at
0.9.  Hematocrit was stable at 36.2.  TSH was 3.5.  Troponin
and CKs x2 were negative.

Her chest x-ray showed signs of CHF.

EKG showed a right bundle branch block at 113, ST elevations
in V3 through V6.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiovascular/coronaries:  Patient has two-vessel CAD
based on her catheterization in [**2143**].  The [**2143**]
catheterization showed LAD with 80% stenosis prior to D2, 90%
stenosis after D2, RCA with 40% stenosis in the mid section
and 40% stenosis after the PDA takeoff.  Patient was
continued on aspirin, beta blocker, Imdur.  Her statin was
held in light of transaminitis.

Patient was determined not to be a catheterization candidate
at the present time.

Pump:  The patient's ejection fraction is less than 25% based
on an echocardiogram on [**11-27**] with trace AR and MR.  The
patient was continued on her ACE inhibitor and beta blocker,
and nitrates.  Her ACE inhibitor was titrated upwards
throughout the hospitalization and eventually changed to
lisinopril 20 q.d. on [**2149-3-11**].  Her Imdur was also titrated
upwards and eventually changed to 90 mg q.d. on [**2149-3-12**].
The patient responded well to Lasix with the goals negative 1
liter everyday throughout this hospitalization.  The patient
is now on a stable regimen of Lasix 40 p.o. b.i.d.  Patient's
weights continued to decrease throughout this admission.

Patient's CHF exacerbation on admission was likely secondary
to her increasing hypertension.  Patient was started on a
nitroglycerin drip in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for good blood pressure
control and was changed to Imdur as her nitroglycerin drip
was weaned off.  Patient had one episode of flash pulmonary
edema in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], where she again responded to IV Lasix and
nitro paste.  Her ABG at that point in time was 7.31, 46, and
48 with a chest x-ray revealing worsening CHF.  Once her
blood pressure was controlled, she no longer had episodes of
flash pulmonary edema.

Rhythm:  The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm
throughout this admission.

2. Pneumonia:  Patient had hypoxia likely secondary to
pneumonia and worsening CHF.  Patient was started on
ceftriaxone and azithromycin in the Fenard ICU.  However,
secondary to transaminitis one day after starting ceftriaxone
and azithromycin, patient's antibiotic regimen was switched
to levofloxacin on [**3-7**].  Patient will finish a seven-day
regimen of antibiotics on [**3-13**].  Patient's coughing and
productive sputum has now resolved.

3. Transaminitis:  Etiology of transaminitis was likely
secondary to her antibiotics azithromycin and ceftriaxone.
Other etiologies such as liver congestion from CHF might
still be possible.  Shock liver seems unlikely as patient was
never hypotensive.  Patient's AST and ALT continued to trend
down.  Patient never had an elevated bilirubin throughout the
admission.

4. Depression:  Psychiatry was consulted this admission
secondary to questionable suicidal ideations.  Psychiatry
stated that patient has multiple medical problems with
depression and likely a component of dementia.  Patient had
no signs of suicidal ideations on conversation with
Psychiatry.  Psychiatry recommended continuing Celexa and
also would continue to monitor for any serotonergic
side-effects with Celexa in light of her pulmonary carcinoid.
Patient's TSH, RPR, B12, and folate were within normal
limits.  Patient had a one-to-one sitter while in the Fenard
ICU, and this was discontinued once she was transferred to
the floor.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Patient was discharged to rehab on 3
liters nasal cannula.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction.
2. Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 25%.
3. Breast cancer status post mastectomy.
4. Left hip fracture status post open reduction, internal
fixation.
