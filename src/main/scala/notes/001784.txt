CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Generalized weakness and fatigue for one
month.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  76-year-old white male with a
history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary
artery bypass graft times two, also with CHF with an ejection
fraction of 75%, who presents with one month history of
generalized weakness and fatigue.  He notes that for the past
6 months he has had history of increasing orthopnea from [**3-12**]
pillows.  He also has had shortness of breath and dyspnea on
exertion.  He also has had paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  He
has a chronic, non productive cough since last four months.
He reports having had epistaxis yesterday.  Denies any
lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting or abdominal
pain.  Denies any dysuria, bright red blood per rectum or
change in bowel movements.  He recalls having a syncopal
episode in [**Month (only) 216**] while playing golf, but was not worked up
at that time since patient refused electrophysiological
studies.

Urinalysis showed many bacteria with 0-2 red blood cells,
[**7-17**] white blood cells, positive for nitrites.  Chest x-ray
showed evidence of mild congestive heart failure,
cardiomegaly, right lower lobe opacity with elevated right
hemidiaphragm.  Chest x-ray CT showed positive ground glass
findings, possible congestive heart failure vs chronic
infiltrate.  Questionable Amiodarone toxicity.  He also had
mediastinal lymphadenopathy with increased right pleural
effusion.  Also evidence of air trapping.  Electrocardiogram
showed sinus bradycardia with rate of 50, increased prolonged
PR interval, evidence of intraventricular conduction delay, Q
waves in 2 and 3 and AVF, biphasic T waves in 1 and AVL.  T
wave inversions in V1 through V6, 1, 2 and AVL.

ASSESSMENT:  This is a 76-year-old white male with
significant cardiac history including two episodes of
coronary artery bypass graft and low ejection fraction.  He
now presents with dyspnea and generalized weakness which was
attributed to his congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiac:  The patient was felt to be in congestive heart
failure by exam and by history.  He was initially diuresed
with IV Lasix.  The other cardiac issue for him was his
bradycardia which may have been due to increased Digoxin
level.  Consequently his Digoxin was initially held.  Since
he was hypotensive, his Nitro paste was also held.  Given his
history of coronary artery disease, he was also ruled out for
a myocardial infarction.  His Aspirin and Statin were
continued.  Cardiology was consulted regarding his
symptomatic bradycardia.  Cardiology initially recommended to
continue with the diuresis.  They recommended holding the
angiotensin receptor blocker and to continue holding the
Digoxin.  Because of his elevated INR, they also recommended
holding his Coumadin until it drifted back down to 2-3.
Cardiology was consulted on the first day of admission.
Cardiology also recommended starting him on Hydralazine 25 mg
po tid to improve his afterload reduction.  He ruled out for
myocardial infarction with peak CK of 135.  However, his
troponin was elevated at 2.1 but drifted down to .6.  The
elevated troponin may have been in the setting of congestive
heart failure.  On the second day of admission, the patient
felt better, having had diuresis.  He was practically
negative 300 ml after the first day.  He was also continued
back on his Nitro paste to improve preload reduction.
Telemetry showed that his heart rate was generally in the
50's but would decrease down to 30's occasionally.  His
elevated troponin was thought to be secondary to his CHF,
particularly in the setting of acute renal failure.  Because
of his bradycardia, the electrophysiology service was
consulted.  It was felt that he would benefit from
electrophysiology study.  Based on that, he may have needed a
pacemaker.  His history of having a syncopal episode was
concerning.  The syncopal episode occurred in [**Month (only) 216**]
approximately 4 months prior to admission.  The goal is to do
these studies when his INR was less than 1.8.  As of the
second day of admission, the patient's INR was 2.7.  Because
of the patient's blood pressure, it was difficult for him to
receive his Hydralazine and his Furosemide.  Secondary to
admission, the patient received echocardiogram which showed
moderate left atrial enlargement, mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy, mild left ventricular dilatation and
severely depressed left ventricular systolic function.  It
also showed moderate global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis, trace aortic regurgitation, 1+ mitral
regurgitation and an ejection fraction of 20%.  Compared to
echocardiogram done in [**2139-6-7**], showed significant decrease
in left ventricular function.  For his bradycardia,
electrophysiology also felt that functional status of his
heart would also be important prior to the electrophysiology
study.  Consequently he was to go for stress thallium test.
By the third day of admission, the patient's heart rate had
gradually improved to 60's to 70's.  This is more suggestive
of a possible Digoxin as the cause.  His stress thallium was
done on the third day of admission.  During the exercise
portion, the patient had no angina, no ischemic
electrocardiographic changes.  The patient was on Heparin
since his Coumadin was being held for his aortic valve
replacement anticoagulation.  His stress thallium test showed
no angina, no ischemic EKG changes.  Showed moderate partly
reversible perfusion defects in the inferior and inferior
septal wall.  Had mild reversible perfusion defects in the
apex, apical se
