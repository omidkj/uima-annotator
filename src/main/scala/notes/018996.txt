Service:  [**Hospital1 139**] Internal Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female
resident of the [**Hospital3 **] Center for Aged with past
medical history of CAD, right bundle branch block, and LAD,
hypertension, status post colectomy for colon cancer with
colostomy, who presented on the [**3-11**] to the hospital
status post fall with left hip pain and a left hip fracture.  She
was seen both by the Orthopedics and medicine services.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Dementia.
2. Colectomy for colon/rectal cancer with colostomy.
3. Hypertension.
4. Anxiety.
5. Osteopenia.
6. Right bundle branch block with LAD on EKG.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Atenolol 50 q.d.
2. Calcium carbonate 650 b.i.d.
3. Vitamin D 400 b.i.d.
4. Boost Plus q.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco use, no ethanol use, and no IVDA,
retired legal secretary, never married.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unable to obtain.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken for ORIF on the [**3-12**] and given intraoperative IV beta blockade at which
point she underwent a difficult intubation, which required
four attempts and shortly thereafter being turned in the
prone position, had what was thought to be at the time a PEA
arrest.  Patient was turned back in the supine position, given
multiple chest compressions, Epinephrine and phenylephrine with
immediate response, but was noted to have hypertensive and
tachycardic response.  Patient was then hemodynamically
stabilized with IV labetalol, esmolol, and lidocaine.  She was
returned to the PACU, where she was noted on telemetry to have
brief episode of second degree A-V block type two. The patient
briefly required mechanical ventilation for respiratory and
metabolic acidosis, and was admitted to the MICU. She was
successfully extubated on the [**3-13**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON MICU ADMISSION:  Temperature of 98.2,
pulse 76 and regular, blood pressure 144/61, and O2
saturation 99%.  General:  Intubated, anxious patient.  EOMI.
PERRLA.  Positive JVD, no bruits, and no lymphadenopathy.
Diffuse crackles.  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs,
or gallops.  Abdomen was soft, positive bowel sounds, ostomy
bag with stool drainage.  Extremities:  Left foreshortened
and externally rotated, no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Neurologic:  Patient was intubated and sedated.

While in the MICU, the patient was evaluated by the EP service.
Given her history of fall leading to her hip fracture and
intermittent type II Mobitz rhythm observed in the PACU, the
patient was also maintained on telemetry.  She was found to be a
candidate for pacemaker placement given her history of fallen
observed Mobitz-II rhythm. It was felt that she would benefit
from this pacemaker prior to repeat attempt at hip surgery.  The
patient was transferred out of the MICU to the Medicine team for
further medical stabilization.

The [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was subsequently complicated by
further arrhythmia--the patient was noted to have atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response as well as
rate-related ischemic changes.  Patient was given IV
diltiazem with decrease in rate from the 150s to the 100s.
The patient reported having chest heaviness at the time of
the episode.  Patient was maintained on telemetry and was not
noticed to have further episodes of atrial fibrillation.

She was transferred to the Vascular Intensive Care Unit for
closer monitoring.  The patient was maintained on IV Heparin
given her intermittent episode of atrial fibrillation.  Patient
was felt to have either demand ischemia or mild MI in the setting
of her RVR, as she was noted to subsequently have an increase in
troponin from 0.01 to a maximum of 0.18 with similar rise in CK
and CK-MB. Patient was maintained on aspirin, low-dose beta
blocker to control hypertension, and cardiac enzymes were
followed. At times, the patient had difficult to control
hypertension, and was taking hydralazine 10 q.i.d. as well as
metoprolol 10 q.i.d.

As it was unclear whether the patient would tolerate operative
repair of her hip, physical Therapy was consulted to assess
whether the patient could tolerate weightbearing without
significant pain. Physical Therapy worked with the patient on
several sessions, and the patient was not able to stand and
weightbear without significant pain.  During one of the sessions
with Physical Therapy, the patient was noted to have bradycardic
episode with heart rate drop to the 30s with worsening hypoxia,
saturating only 92% on 100% nonrebreather.  She seemed to improve
with aggressive suctioning, however remained in respiratory
distress.

The patient's family was notified of the events as they occurred
over the course of her hospitalization. When the patient
developed respiratory distress, her healthcare proxy was again
[**Name (NI) 653**], and reaffirmed the family did not want the patient to
be intubated or even noninvasively mechanically ventilated, and
reaffirmed her status as DNR/DNI. The patient continued to have
ongoing hypoxia with SPO2 in the 80% range despite suctioning.
She remained tachypneic and with diffuse wheezes and rhonchi.
Patient was given IV Lasix and was maintained on a nonrebreather
oxygen facemask.  The patient's mental status declined following
this episode, and the patient remained nonresponsive to verbal
and tactile stimuli.

A decision was made after lengthy discussions with the
[**Hospital 228**] healthcare proxys to change the patient's level of
care to comfort measures only.  The patient's medications
were discontinued and the patient was begun on a Morphine drip.
The patient expired at 3:40 a.m. on the [**3-21**].  The
cause of death was respiratory arrest.  The patient's family
and attending were notified.  The patient's family declined
autopsy.  The medical examiner was notified and declined
postmortem evaluation.
