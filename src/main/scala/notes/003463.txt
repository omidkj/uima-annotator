Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**]
Chief Complaint:
Right hip fracture.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right ORIF
Bronchoscopy
Lumbar puncture.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 73 yo male with h/o CLL, CAD, and autoimmune
hemolytic anemia who was admitted after a mechanical fall at
home which resulted in a fractured R femur.  The patient was
unable to wean from ventilation so was admitted to the ICU for
further management.

Per report, the patient reached over to pick up a pill and fell
out of bed onto his right hip, hitting his head.  No LOC.  He
reported R hip pain and inability to ambulate, plain film
showing a comminuted intertrochanteric fracture of R femur.
Head CT showed no intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.  The
patient went to the OR for repair (R hip nail and ORIF) and was
unable to be extubated.  Per [**First Name3 (LF) **] resident report, patient did
not tolerate wean of PSV, but not clear what the issue was.
Appears from PACU notes that patient had large amounts of
secretions and unable to wean below PS of 12.  Currently on PSV
[**11-19**] on arrival to the floor, weaned to [**9-19**].  Of note, the
patient rec'd 0.2 mg IV dilaudid x8, lasix 10 mg IV x4.  Patient
had a total of 3.6L in (LR, D51/2NS with 20 KCL and propofol)
and 1.0L out.  Also rec'd a total of 3 units prbcs and 3 bags
platelets between the ED and intraOP over the course of the day.

In terms of history, as per OMR and prior admission notes, the
patient has had cough for ~ 2 months, was given a course of
levaquin in [**10-23**] with minimal improvement and return of the
cough.  CT chest on [**2134-11-16**] showed no focal pna, sputum neg for
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 103758**] negative, and AFB was neg x3. He did have rare
[**Last Name (un) 4904**] of gram neg bacteria. He required 2 doses of neupogen for
decreased cell counts and 2 blood transfusions. He had been on
cefepime but it was discontinued as it likely caused his
decrease in cell counts. Readmitted on [**2134-11-15**] due to cough and
shortness of breath. CT chest at that time was negative but
showed pleural effusions which were tapped and pt was started on
lasix.  He subsequently rec'd Rituxan as an outpatient. He was
readmitted on [**12-8**] for cough/fever and nasal washes were RSV+.
Pulm and ID at ths time did not feel there was involvement of
the lower respiratory tract, though pulm thought that the
chronic cough may be a result of lung scarring/pathology from
neoplastic related previous effusion, chronic sinusitis, and
reflux.  Patient rec'd 5 days of levaquin and IVIG.  Repeat CXR
was concerning for developing infiltrate and levaquin was
continued for a total of 15 day course on [**2134-12-23**].  On [**2134-12-27**],
per OMR notes, the patient spiked a fever of 101 with increased
cough, productive of clear/whitish sputum.  CXR at the time
showed interval development of a multilobar, right sided pna.
Repeat RSV washes were positive.  Additionally, blood cultures
were positive for strep pneumo, pan sensitive.  He was treated
with ctx 1gm IV (10 day course) and azithromycin x5 days.  He
was sent home on cefpodoxime on [**1-2**] to complete 7 more days of
therapy.

The patient apparently tolerated surgery well.  He is now s/p
pinning and ORIF with approximately 200 cc EBL.  Patient's
pressures and vital signs have been stable, afebrile.  Unable to
obtain ROS due to sedation/intubation.

Past Medical History:
-CLL/SLL, on Rituxan/Bedamustine

-Status post left hip femoral head stress fracture [**2131-2-14**].
-Status post T5 and T12 vertebral fractures on [**2131-10-23**].
-RSV

Most recent Imaging:
CXR:
FINDINGS: As seen on the prior study, there are bilateral
pleural effusions and hazy opacity over both lower lungs. While
this could all be due to the fluid and volume loss, an
underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded. There is a
right-sided PICC with tip in the SVC/RA junction.

MRI Head:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality.
2. Normal MRA of the intracranial vessels.
3. Small vessel ischemic disease.
4. Bone marrow infiltration versus hyperplasia. Clinical
correlation
