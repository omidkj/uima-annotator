Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11495**]
Chief Complaint:
Pericardial tamponade

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
80 yo M with h/o aflutter ablation on [**12-16**] and an abdominal
mass of unclear etiology s/p gastric biopsy on [**1-27**], transferred
from [**Hospital1 **] for cardiac tamponade and cardiogenic shock. He
had been having mild DOE for 2-3 months, per wife, but otherwise
well. Two days prior to presentation, the pt developed abd pain
and vomiting. He did not immediately seek treatment. He then
developed CP while shoveling and went to the ED on [**1-30**]; was
felt to have MSK pain & was d/c'ed on Toradol and muscle
relaxants. On [**1-30**], pt was ascending stairs when he had
presyncope and acute periumbilical abd pain. He was taken to
[**Hospital1 **] ED where BP 90/60 and EKG showed diffuse ST elevations
and PR depression inferiorly. A Chest CT done to r/o dissection
showed a large pericardial effusion, and bedside TTE showed
signs of tamponade. Because of hypotension, he was started on
dopamine and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for pericardial drainage. In
[**Hospital1 18**] ED he was treated w/ levo/flagyl x1 for potential gut
ischemia/ process due to severe abdominal pain and lactic
acidosis. Pt had an initial gas: 7.21/18/88 with lactate 7.

In cath lab, 560 cc blood drained. At end of procedure, he went
into respiratory arrest and was intubated due to resp fatigue
and increasing acidosis, then went into PEA arrest and a pacing
wire was placed. He rec'd epi and atropine, developed Vfib and
was shocked out into NSR but still hypotensive- IABP placed, put
on levophed as well as DA. He received 11mg epi, 100 mg lido
also, then sent to CCU. Here initially very unstable with pH ~7;
received several amps bicarb and serial TTE to r/o accumulation
of effusion which showed no increase. He had unstable rapid AF
which was cardioverted.

In addition:
CXR showed a L retrocardiac opacity
LFT's rose to several thousand within the first few hours
Hct dropped from 37 to 26
Pt had INR of 2.4 from coumadin; was given multiple units of FFP
and Vit K 10 mg sq
Lactate peaked at 15.

Past Medical History:
Aflutter s/p ablation [**2168-12-16**]
Atrial fibrillation
Hypothyroidism
S/p TURP
S/p Hernia repair
S/p bilat TKRs [**2161**]
S/p rotator cuff surgery
S/p tonsillectomy
[**12-28**] - CT abd showing small pericardial effusion and small mass
near pancreas. EGD [**1-27**] showed benign gastric musosa. Unclear
why the mass was not biopsied.

Social History:
Married, lives with wife.

Family History:
NC

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Tamponade:
- S/p pericardial effusion drain placed and removed 2d later
when had no output although flushed, and serial TTEs did not
show further accumulation of blood. + Small residual effusion
but no signs of tamponade and size of effusion stable x several
days.
.
2. Cardiogenic shock/ Pump
- Initially very poor CI due to both tamponade and cardioversion
shocks. Initially on levophed/dopa and changed to dopa/dobut to
increase CO, but then weaned off x several days with good BPs
and CO.
- Repeat TTE showed improvement of LVEF several days after
admission.
- With improvement in CI, had resolution of acidosis with
decreased lactate, decreased LFTs, and improved appearance of
extremities.
- As 12L positive over first 1-2d, was diuresed with lasix
aggressively and diuresed well.
.
3. Rhythm
- Pt has a h/o AF and was cardioverted into NSR initially due to
unstable BP. Because then had several episodes of PAF during
first 2-3d of hospitalization, was started on procainamide with
resolution of his AF (due to elevated LFTs, avoided amio).
.
4. Metabolic acidosis
- Initially thought to be due to poor forward flow and resulting
ischemia to either gut (explaining abdominal pain) and/or
extremities (initially cold and blue). Then resolved.
.
5. Respiratory failure
- As RSBI low, was extubated on [**2-3**] but re-intubated later that
evening due to secretions and tachypnea, dropping sats, thought
to be d/t mucous plugging vs. volume overload.
- Attempt to diurese aggressively over next couple days (was 5L
negative on [**2-4**]) to facilitate extubation.
.
6. GI
- Abdominal pain at home likely not related to very elevated
LFTs which are likely due to shock liver, now trending down
daily. Has pancreatic tail cystic appearing mass, the etiology
of which is unknown. Had gastric biopsy but no bx of this mass.
- Some blood initially from mouth, unclear if this was from
stomach or just mouth but has not continued- on PPI daily.
.
7. Infectious disease
- Initially given dose of levo/flagyl in ED and standing Unasyn
to cover potential translocation of bowel organisms during
ischemic episode.
.
8. Thrombocytopenia
- Plt dropped in first couple days; stopped heparin sq and
sending HIT. Plts were trending up.
.
9. Coagulopathy
- Though on coumadin at home for AF, had INR of 1.6 day PTA and
up to 2.4 after admit here; took several units of FFP and Vit K
10 mg x 1 to bring down, now not on any anticoagulation and INR
in 1's. Elevated INR also thought [**2-8**] shock liver.
.
10. FEN
- Being aggressive about checking K's tid to qid while diuresing
so much. Started TPN [**2-5**]. Starting free water through NGT.
.
11. Access
- Groin lines incl swan pulled; now R IJ (placed [**2-5**]), +
peripherals.
.
12. Proph
- Pneumoboots, protonix qd.
.
13. Full code. Family including wife, kids, very involved.

*******************
On [**2169-2-6**], the pt had gone for HIDA scan when went into PEA
arrest and passed away despite aggressive attempts at
resuscitation. The pt's family agreed to an autopsy.
