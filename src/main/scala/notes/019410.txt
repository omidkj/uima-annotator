Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 6807**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
66F with a long history of recurrent pericarditis and a chronic
pericardial effusion who presents with a month of palpitations,
2 weeks of cough, and a 1 of escalating DOE as well as a
prolonged recurrence of her typical pericaritis symptoms. She
reports that her first attack of pericarditis was in [**2151**] and
characterized by positional and pleuritic chest pain. This has
recurred several times over the past 23 years. She has treated
this with Motrin 800 mg PO TID with good effect in the past.
Approximately 1 year ago she was incidentally noted to have a
pericardial effusion. This was monitored on ECHO for 9 months,
and was noted to be stable to slightly enlarging so she
underwent pericardioscentesis on [**2174-10-26**]. Evaluation of that
fluid showed a benign transudate without evidence of infection
or malignancy. Since that time her pericarditis has been
smoldering with persistent pleuritic chest pain that radiates to
her neck and is worse lying on her left side, and relieved with
NSAIDs and sitting forward. For the past month she has noted
occassional palpitations and increased fatigue. Her appetite has
been low and she has been eating less, but her weight is
increased. For the past 2 weeks she has had a new cough without
symptoms of a URI. Approximately a week ago she began to have
worsening DOE to the point that she gets winded with walking
just 4 steps. Given her ongoing symptoms, she called her
cardiologist. He referred her to the ED for further management.

In the ED, initial vitals were 98.3 88 123/75 24 98% on 4L. She
was noted to be in Afib with a rate around 130 shortly
thereafter. A AP CXR showed possible new pleural effusion on the
L. A bedside ECHO showed no evidence of RA or RV collapse. She
was bolused NS 1000 mL and received morphine 4 mg IV x1 for
pain. She was admitted to the CCU for further management.

Before coming up to the CCU she was ordered for a PA and LAT CXR
which confirmed a new left pleural effusion 1/3 up the lung
field as well as a mild right pleural effusion.

On arrival in the CCU she was in sinus at around 80/min. She
reported ongoing chest pain which is pleuritis and positional,
as well as DOE.

On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Past Medical History:
- Chronic pericardial effusion, first diagnosed [**12-22**] during an
admission at OSH for acute cholecystitis. Extensive infectious
and inflammatory work-up (including thyroid and autoimmune) as
outpt has been negative. Echo has shown moderate sized effusion,
alongside the right ventricle, suggestive of some elevation in
the intrapericaridal presure. Echos have shown some stranding
suggesting partial organization. Last ESR was 16.
- Recurrent pericarditis. Initial event was in [**2151**]. Pt reports
weeklong period of intense sharp, diffuse chest pain, worse with
breathing and moving, better leaning forward, radiating to the
trapesius muscles. Did not see a doctor at the time, but her
then has had 6-7 episodes of fatigue and CP following URIs that
are similar in nature (CP is pleuritic, painful wearing a bra,
diffuse, non-radiating, better sitting forward, last for days).
In [**10/2174**] a cultute of the effusion grew coag negative Staph,
but this was felt to be a contaminant. Otherwise, evaluation at
that time was negative for infection or malignancy, and the
fluid was consistent with a transudate.
- Recent abdominal US has shown multiple partial septated cysts
up to 4.3cm in the left liver lobe.
- anxiety
- s/p cholecystectomy [**12-22**]
- s/p tonsillectomy as a child
- s/p hysterectomy 20 years ago for endometriosis
- New Afib [**11/2174**]

[**12-13**] EKG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Modest diffuse ST-T wave changes are non-specific. Since the
previous tracing of [**2174-10-31**] atrial fibrillation has replaced
sinus rhythm and ST-T wave changes are present.

[**12-13**] CXR: 1. Interval development of moderate left base opacity
may represent combination of pleural effusion and atlectasis;
underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  2. Small right
pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.

[**12-14**] Echo: Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There is abnormal septal motion suggestive of
pericardial constriction. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential. The effusion is echo
dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular
elements. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents
