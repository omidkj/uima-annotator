History of Present Illness:
The pt is an 80 yo male with h/o severe OSA on 2L at home and
colon cancer s/p colectomy who presents with AMS, s/p 2 falls,
slurred speech, visual hallucinations, and worsening pco2. The
wife reports
he's been having hallucinations for 1.5 wks. Her husband
reported seeing people in the room who were not there and was
talking to these people. He also called 911 to ask the police to
remove these people from his house. He's also had slurred speech
for the past week. She reports he hit his head at 4am yesterday
with a resulting periorbital hematoma. He put his weight on a
table and the other end came up and hit him in the head. He then
fell again tonight which was unwitnessed but his wife thinks he
fell off the couch onto the rug. Over the last few days, his c02
has been rising at his PCPs office. Wife says these sx are
consistent with previous hypercarbic respiratory failure when he
needed to be admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] 2 yrs ago.
.
Vitals on arrival to the ED were 98.2 100 142/83 16 96%. His ABG
showed pH 7.28 pCO2 78 pO260 and he was started on biPAP. CXR
was notable for mild pulm edema bilaterally. Blood cx was sent
but patient refused the 2nd of 2 blood cultures. The patient
refused a foley to obtain a UA. Labs in the ED were notable for
trop 0.04, lactate 1.2, WBC 8.5, k+ 6.3, BUN 26/creatinine 1.3,
glc 212, AST 81, ProBNP 1185. His legs were notable for a
cellulitis and he received vancomycin 1gram IV x1. The patient
refused CT head, chest, spine, abd/pelvis. Vitals prior to
transfer were 97.8 75 131/108 RR15 94% on BiPAP with 5 peep and
30% fi02.
.
On arrival to the floor the patient was agitated and wanting to
take off his c-collar. He was refusing to put on his CPAP
without administration of something for his anxiety. Meanwhile
he was satting 82% on 2L NC. He was given ativan 0.25mg IV. He
was placed on BiPAP and sats dropped as low as 69% and later
improvd to the 80s. He was intubated and started on propofol for

[**2134-12-3**] CT head non contrast:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial pathological
process.
COMMENT: There is a suggestion of minimal bilateral proptosis,
without
extraocular muscle abnormalities to suggest Grave's disease.
Please correlate this observation clinically.
.
[**2134-12-3**] CT c-spine:
CT CHEST: The pulmonary arterial tree is well opacified, and
there is no
evidence of pulmonary embolism. The aorta is normal in caliber
without
evidence of acute aortic syndrome. Extensive calcifications of
the aorta and coronary arteries are seen.
Within the lung parenchyma, there is bibasilar atelectasis and
consolidation.
The airways are patent to the segmental level. No pericardial
effusion or
measurable pleural effusion is seen. No pathologically enlarged
lymph nodes are present. The patient is intubated with
endotracheal tube approximately 4.6 cm above the carina. A
nasogastric tube is in place with tip within the stomach.
CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: Within the abdomen, there is
cholelithiasis,
including a large stone measuring up to 5.5 x 5.3 cm within the
gallbladder fundus, which was present on the prior examination,
however, may be slightly increased in size. No evidence of
gallbladder wall edema is seen. No choledocholithiasis is
identified. The liver, kidneys, adrenal glands, spleen, and
pancreas appear grossly unremarkable. Loops of small and large
bowel are of normal size and caliber. There is diffuse anasarca
with some nonspecific diffuse stranding of the mesentery. Again
seen are extensive vascular calcifications. Several
retroperitoneal lymph nodes measuring up to 1.3 cm in short axis
(500b:77) are present however these are non-specific. No free
air is seen. The patient is status post right hemicolectomy.
CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Again noted the patient is status post
right
hemicolectomy. There is diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. The
bladder is collapsed around a urinary catheter. There are
prostatic calcifications.
Again noted is diffuse mild anasarca. No pelvic free air is
seen.
BONE WINDOWS: No concerning osseous lesion is seen. Bone islands
in the left iliac bone and within the ribs are stable.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Bibasilar atelectasis and
possible
aspiration/consolidation.
2. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
