Service:  CCU Medicine [**Hospital Ward Name 517**]

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  AICD firing.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old gentleman
with an AICD placed in outside hospital in [**2158-12-17**]
for atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia with DDI placed
at [**Hospital3 **].  Patient has also had two visits to the [**Hospital1 1444**] one ED visit, one outpatient,
Electrophysiology clinic visit for adjustments of a threshold
setting as the patient's atrial flutter was inappropriately
setting off the firing of the AICD.  The threshold had been
....................< to 170 beats per minute at time of
admission.  Patient had at least two episodes of AICD firing
on the day prior to admission.  Was brought in from [**Hospital6 46219**] For the Age resident and arrived in the ED heart
rate of 160, blood pressure 120/90.

ECG at that point was initially interpreted as atrial
fibrillation with ventricular rate of 170.  Patient was given
5 mg of intravenous Lopressor and 60 mg of IV adenosine.
Heart rate decreased to 140s and 150s.  Patient was given an
additional of 5 mg of Lopressor.  Heart rate decreased into
the 140s.  Blood pressure fell to 79/56.  Patient was given
normal saline bolus 500 cc and shocked cardioversion 200
joules with 2 mg of Versed.

The patient was given additional 200 joule shock and
intubated at that point, also given 300 mg of IV amiodarone
transcutaneous pacing ....................< at that time as
well as right IJ central line transcutaneous pacing was then
stopped at the recommendation of the Electrophysiology
service.  Dopamine drip was started for blood pressure at
that point to 70/44 and bumped back up to 140-160 systolic
blood pressure.  Total fluids received in the Emergency [**Apartment Address(1) 46220**].5 liters of normal saline.

Patient arrived in the CCU intubated requiring Versed and
propofol for agitation and sedation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. CABG in [**2145**].
2. AICD placed in [**2158**] as mentioned above.
3. Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of
1.9.
4. Left lower lobe granuloma.
5. MI in [**2158**].
6. CHF with EF of 30%.
7. Depression.
8. GERD.
9. Right CEA.
10. Renal stones.
11. Cholelithiasis.
12. Pneumonia in [**Month (only) 216**] of this year.

ALLERGIES:  No known allergies, but there is a noted GI
intolerance to amiodarone.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 81.
2. Calcium carbonate b.i.d.
3. Imdur 30.
4. Lansoprazole 30.
5. Lopressor 12.5 in a.m. and 25 in p.m.
6. Multivitamin.
7. Senna.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired salesman, widowed.
Requiring assistance with many of his activities of daily
living, a resident of [**Hospital6 459**] for the Age.  He
has a son, who is his proxy involved in his care.

LABORATORIES:  Initial laboratories were unremarkable.
Initial CK was 30.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General physical exam was notable for
a very thin emaciated elderly gentleman with noted temporal
wasting.  Chest wall is very thin with all ribs prominent.
Lungs are extremely clear on examination.  Palpable AICD was
palpable in the left upper quadrant of the chest.  The
abdomen is benign, no evidence of lower extremity edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was the input of
Electrophysiology had his AICD threshold lowered
....................< appropriate firing for V-tach.
Patient, in review of the ECGs, had actually in ventricular
tachycardia.  Patient had approximately 17 episodes of AICD
firing including overdrive pacing during his initial course
in the CCU.  Patient was started on amiodarone drip at 1
mg/minute as well as lidocaine drip 1 mg/minute.  The
lidocaine was subsequently discontinued during the following
morning.

Sedation was maintained with propofol and dopamine was
gradually weaned off.  Patient was successfully extubated,
and was transferred to the floor on the [**12-26**].
Plan was to discharge the patient back to [**Hospital6 459**]
for the Age with initial outpatient medications and with the
addition of amiodarone ....................<  p.o. b.i.d.
The drip has since been discontinued.  Pacer threshold has
been readjusted.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Ventricular tachycardia with AICD
firing.
