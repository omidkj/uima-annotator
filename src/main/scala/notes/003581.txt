Pertinent Results:
[**4-7**] NCHCT
1. Extensive intra- and extra-axial hemorrhage within the left
cerebral
hemisphere causing subfalcine herniation 7 mm to the right and
suggestion of impending downward transtentorial herniation.

[**4-8**] CT/CTA
1. Stable extent of left-sided subdural hematoma and
fronto-parieto-occipital hemorrhages with significant mass
effect and midline shift. In the presence of marked
hypointensity within the left corona radiata, concomitant
infarct is not excluded.

2. There is no evidence of cerebral aneurysm or vascular
malformation. CTA
neck is unremarkable.

[**4-9**] NCHCT - No short interval change of multicompartmental
hemorrhage since one day prior. No increased mass effect or new
hemorrhage.

[**4-11**] NCHCT - 1. Known left parietooccipital parenchymal
hemorrhage and left hemispheric subdural hematoma, similar to
the prior study of [**2179-4-9**]. No new hemorrhage.
2. The ventricles and sulci are mildly enlarged, consistent with
involutional changes.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the neurosurgery service on [**4-7**]. He was
given FFP and profiline nine to reverse his elevated INR. His
SBP was controlled to SBP less than 140 and he was transferred
to the ICU. He had a CTA head to evaluate for malformation and
this was negative. A repeat CTH on [**4-8**] was stable and showed no
increase in hemorrhage. On [**4-8**] his HCT was 23 and he was given
2 units of PRBC and his HCT increased to 27.8. He remained
neurologically stable and another repeat CT head showed no
change.

On [**4-10**], patient intact on exam, he remains hypertensive on
cardiene gtt. Blood pressure was liberalized to SBP<160 and
cardiene gtt is being weaned and his oral medication increased.


On [**4-11**] a repeat Head Ct was obtained which demonstrated no
significant cahnge of left SDH and intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
No significant shift.  on [**4-12**], he was evaluated by PT and was
cleared for discharge home in stable condition and will
follow-up accordingly.
