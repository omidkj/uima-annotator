Pertinent Results:
[**2182-4-24**] Cath: 1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant system reveals severe native 3 vessel disease.  The
LMCA has diffuse disease.  The LAD, LCx, and RCA are all
occluded proximally. 2.  Arterial conduit angiography revealed
the LIMA to be widely patent. There is diffuse disease in the
mid-distal LAD distal to the anastamosis.  The is left to rigth
collaterals to the distal PDA.  The SVG to OM is thrombotically
occluded in its proximal segment.  The SVG to PDA has a distal
90% stenosis. 3.  Resting hemodynamic measurement reveals
moderately elevated biventricular filling pressure (with RVEDP
of 18mmHg and mean PCWP of 22mmHg) with moderate pulmonary
hypertension (56/25mmHg). The cardiac output is decreased at
2.2L/min/m2. 4.  Left ventriculography was deferred given the
patient's history of renal insufficiency.
[**2182-4-26**] Chest CT: 1. Prior sternotomy and CABG. Atherosclerotic
calcification of the thoracic aorta, most prominent at the top
of the arch, with minimal calcification of the ascending aorta.
2. Mild pulmonary edema. 3. Two tiny sub- 4 mm pulmonary
nodules. In the absence of a known primary malignancy, 1 year
followup with CT could be performed if the patient has a history
of smoking or other risk factors for lung cancer.
[**2182-4-26**] Echo: Prebypass: There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed. LVEF <20%. There is severe global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis which improved somewhat after
pericardial stripping.. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The abdominal aorta is moderately dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pericardium appears thickened. Postbypass: patient on epil,
milranone, norepi, phenylehphrine. LV function is unchanged with
an LVEF 20%. There is improved function in the anterior wall,
which is mild to moderately hypokinetic. The remaing walls are
severely hypokinetic. The right ventricle appears mild to
moderately hypokinetic. Aortic contours are intact. IABP is seen
with its tip 2 cm below the left subclavian. Remaining exam is
unchanged.
[**2182-4-30**] LE Art Dup: Findings consistent with acute occlusion of
the common femoral artery and most of the superficial femoral
artery, reconstitution of the distal SFA with low flows,
however.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 72438**] was seen in the cardiac
surgery office and was transferred over to [**Hospital1 18**] where he was
admitted. On [**4-24**] he was brought for a cardiac cath which
revealed severe three vessel disease and occluded vein grafts.
Over the next couple days he received medical management and was
the taken to the operating room on [**2182-4-26**]. The patient on
induction had a bradycardic cardiac arrest and had to be
resuscitated by chest compressions and a bolus of epinephrine to
resuscitate him. Before starting the surgery, in view of the
arrest, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed through the
right femoral artery. After a period of resuscitation, the
patient stabilized and surgery was commenced. He underwent a
redo-sternotomy, coronary artery bypass graft x 4. Please see
operative report for details. In view of the poor cardiac
function, cardiac arrest, and multiple drips, the decision was
made to leave the chest open. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CSRU for invasive monitoring on multiple
inotropes in critical condition. On post-op day one he was taken
back to the operating room where he underwent closure of his
sternotomy. Please see operative report for details. He was then
transferred back to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. He
remained intubated on multiple vasoactive drips and with a
balloon pump. His IABP was weaned successfully and dc'd on POD
#3. He was seen by vascular surgery for a loss of DP/and PT
signals after the IABP was removed, and a heparin gtt was
recommended.  He was taken to the operating room by vascular
surgery on [**4-30**] where he underwent a right femoral thrombectomy
and patch angioplasty. As such, he will require 3 months of
coumadin. He went into afib on [**5-1**] with a drop in BP/SVO2 and
CO, and required cardioversion which was unsuccessful, he was
started on amiodarone. He was seen by infectious diseases for
persistent fever, rising whiwte count and increase in ETT
secretions. Bronchoscopy revealed pneumonia in RUL and LLL,
sputum culture showed gram + cocci and gram negative rods, and
was started on vacomycin and zosyn.He was also found to have a
gram positive bacteremia and rising LFTs. Abdominal ultrasound
was negative. He was extubated on [**5-4**]. Bedside swallow
evaluation showed aspiration and the patient remained NPO. Tube
feeds were started. His creatinine rose but improved with
discontinuation of his lasix gtt. He continued to be followed by
