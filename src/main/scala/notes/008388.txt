Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Ipratropium

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R IJ CVL placement [**5-17**]

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yo demented NH resident with CHF (EF 15%), CRI (Cr 1.0-1.3),
CAD s/p stents, DM who presents with labored breathing,
hypotension, diaphorisis, and confusion, suspected to have
urosepsis.
.
Pt was in USOH at [**Hospital3 2558**]. Noon fingerstick 327 and he
received 8 units regular insulin. At approximately 2:15 PM he
was noted to be poorly responsive, diaphoretic, and with labored
breathing.  His systolic BP was 70, HR >110, he had a loose BM.
02 sat on RA was 80% increased to 92% with 2L NC. He is a full
code and family requests evaluation so PCP sent him to ED.
.
Of note, pt was recently admitted from [**3-2**] to [**3-22**] with
unresponsiveness and fever. He required intubation in the ED due
to thick secretions versus mucus plugging. He was empirically
treated with vancomycin and zosyn for PNA. Extubated on [**3-7**],
but required regular airway suctioning. On the floor, he
deveolped new PNA (aspiration vs HAP). Abx were changed to
ceftazidime, flagyl
and IV vancomycin was continued.  The patient defervesced and
his leukocytosis resolved. During his stay, he also had coag neg
staph TLC infection. He was followed by ID and it was decided to
cover him broadly with Vanc, Ceftax, Flagyl for 14 day course
which he completed on [**2186-3-29**].
.
His course was c/b by NSTEMI on admission that was managed
conservatively. Heparin gtt stopped due to GIB, Hct remained
stable at 25. Also AF/RVR responsive to IV BB, and ARF on
chronic, improved with IVF. Furthermore, CHF exacerbation with
EF of [**11-21**]% (previously 20% in 9/[**2186**]). Found to have thrombi
on the echo that decreased in size on repeat echo. Not a
candidate for anticoagulation given GIB. On the floor, again
acute resp distress. BNP of over [**Numeric Identifier 389**]. He was aggressively
diuresed and discharged on 100 PO lasix daily.
improved.
.
In the ED, his VS were T104, 106, 95/63, 36, 99%NRB.
Unresponsive on exam. An EKG showed old STD I, aVL. CXR was
unremarkable. Head CT without acute change. WBC up with left
shift. Lactate 2.2 -> 3.8. UA positive. Hypotensive to .80s/50s.
Received total of 1L IVF. Code sepsis was called. R IJ was
placed after two attempts. Vanc, Zosyn, Flagyl given and
admitted to ICU.
.
On arrival, pt was still unresponsive, satting well on NRB.

Cardiac Echo [**2187-3-19**]: EF 15-20%. Dilated, severely hypokinetic
left ventricle with a left ventricular thrombus. Compared with
the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-3-5**], the previously
seen apical thrombus is not seen (although the apex is not well
visualized). The previously seen inferior apical thrombus now
measures 1.0 x 1.6cm (previously measured as 1.5cm x 1.7cm). The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is slightly higher on the
current study.

R PICC placed under ultrasound guidance on [**5-22**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course by problem:

1.  Sepsis -UTI and Cdiff colitis: Patient was hypotensive and
unresponsive at rehab. Found to have urosepsis with Pseudomonas
growing from urine and severe C difficile colitis. BB and lasix
were held when patient was initially hypotensive. He responded
to 15 litres total of Ringers lactate boluses.  He was initially
on IV vancomycin/Pip-Tazo, and then IV metronidazole and PO
Vancomycin were added on for severe C. difficile colitis. IV
Vancomycin was discontinued on [**5-20**] due to lack of Gram positive
culture data.  His Piperacillin-Tazobactam was changed to
meropenem on [**2187-5-21**] when his UTI pseudomonas returned as
resistant to Zosyn but sensitive to meropenem, and he will need
to complete a 2-week course for urosepsis wiht last day on
[**2187-6-3**].  He will then need to complete an additional 2-weeks
of Oral Vancomycin 250mg PO q6 hours and oral metronidazole
500mg PO q8 hours up until 2 weeks after the completion of the
meropenem (last day [**2187-6-17**]).  Patient's blood pressure
normalized with fluid boluses and furosemide and metoprolol were
resumed after this.  PICC line was placed under fluoroscopy for
antibiotic administration.

2.  Respiratory distress: In setting of sepsis and poor EF. CXR
clear. O2 sats remained stable on 3L NC. He received prn
nebulizers.  Furosemide was resumed after achieving adequate
fluid resuscitation. He is currently on furosemide 100mg po
qday.

3.  AMS: Reportedly A&Ox2 at baseline, improved with treatment
of sepsis. Head CT was wnl. TSH, B12, folate were wnl.
Hypernatremia was improved. Patient became responsive and gives
one word ansewrs to questions.

4.  ARF: Resolved with IVF. Baseline creatinine 1.2-1.4. Cr of
2.0 on admission, improved back to baseline after aggressive IV
fluids consistent with prerenal etiology.

5.  CAD: History of stents. EKG without acute changes. Recent
NSTEMI during last admission in setting of GI bleed on heparin
gtt. In ED, trop 0.03, then 0.07, then 0.09 in MICU, thus not
significantly elevated despite ARF. He was continued on ASA. BB
was initially held in setting of sepsis and restarted due to
recurrent ventricular ectopy on telemetry.  He was started on a
dose of 6.25mg po bid, which is lower than his admission dose of
12.5mg po bid, and this will need to be uptitrated as tolerated
as outpatient.  We also held his captopril during his stay due
to borderline blood pressure. This should be restarted and
titrated as an outpatient as his blood pressure improves.

6.  Acute on chronic systolic CHF: EF of 15%. Recent CHF
exacerbation. On 100 Lasix PO daily on discharge from last
hospitalization, at rehab down to 30 daily.  Lasix and BB were
held initially and were restarted due to positive fluid balance
after resuscitation.

7.  Anemia: Hct baseline 25. In ED, Hct first 22, then 40-43
after initial resuscitation, eventually down to ~30 with IV
fluids.

8.  Diabetes mellitus: Patient was transiently on Insulin drip
in the setting of sepsis.  His tube feeds was resumed and his
regimen was adjusted with sliding scale and glargine 30 units at
breakfast.  This will need to be further titrated as out
