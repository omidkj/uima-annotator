Images:
CXR: RML atelectasis

CT chest/abdomen/pelvis:
1. Enlarged, edematous left kidney with perinephric stranding
and fluid. 2-3 mm calculs near the left distal ureter appears
vascular. No definite renal or ureteral stone identified.
2. Fluid in the mid-to-distal esophagus, placing the patient at
risk for
aspiration.
3. Unchanged L1 compression deformity from [**2190-10-31**].
4. 2.5-cm left adnexal cyst.
.
ECHO 06
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis
or regurgitation. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
an anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.


Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo female resident of [**Hospital 100**] rehab with a history of COPD and
dementia presenting with shortness of breath, lethargy and fever
who was noted to have leukocytosis, CXR concerning for PNA, CT
evidence of ureteral stone, renal failure, and urine retention.

1. Dyspnea, RML atelectasis:
There was initial concern for a pneumonia or possible cardiac
etiology such as CHF or CAD so a CXR was obtained that
demonstrated a possible consolidation in the RML and a chest CT
was ordered.  The chest CT demonstrated only atelectasis in the
RML and no acute lung processes and urine legionella was
negative.  Thus, this was most likely a COPD exacerbation and it
was treated with albuterol nebs and ipratropium PRN. At
discharge the pt's 02 sats were in the upper 90's on room air.

2. Fever, hydronephrosis:

The patient had a U/A done while at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab that was
positive for leukocyte esterase, RBCs, and WBCs and was
emperically treated with 1g ceftriaxone IV.  Thus, upon her
arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] the following day, her U/A and urine cx
were negative. Mrs.[**Doctor Last Name 93601**] abdomen was noted to be distended
and a foley was placed that drained around 2 L of urine. She
began spiking high fevers so she was treated with IV
vanco/levo/ceftriaxone in the ED and admitted to the ICU with
concern for pyelonephritis. She received fluids and supplemental
02. Her temperature returned to [**Location 213**] and her 02 requirement
declined. Urology and IR were consulted, but opted not to
perform a procedure given her rapid clinical improvement.  She
was then transferred to the medicine floor and her urine output
was maintained.

3. Renal failure/urinary retention:

Mrs.[**Known lastname 93602**] initial CR was 5.1 and she was hyperkalemic upon
presentation to the ED, most likely from her bladder distention.
 Upon receiving a foley catheter and supplemental fluids, she
produced a good amount of urine and her Cr and potassium levels
returned to [**Location 213**]. She was also given kayexalate to expedite
the process. On [**9-24**] her foley was removed and she was
incontinent following monring, however did not void on own
subsequently, retaining up to 1L of urine in bladder. Thus, a
Foley catheter was reinserted and the patient was discharged
with it in place.  The retention could be due to unresolved
constipation or perhaps neurogrnic causes, which can later be
considered with a Urology follow-up.
