ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post fall with epidural hematoma and C6 fracture.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  C6 burst fracture with epidural hematoma.
2.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation requiring Amiodarone.
3.  Cardiac pacer requiring interrogation.
4.  Left lower lobe pneumonia.
5.  Chronic ventilatory dependence with inability to wean.
6.  Left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis.
7.  Ability to anti-coagulate requiring IVC filter placement
    for pulmonary embolism prophylaxis.
8.  Malnutrition requiring tube feeds.
9.  Fever of unclear origin.

PROCEDURES:
1.  Evacuation of epidural hematoma C6 corpectomy and fusion
with cage on [**2138-11-4**].
2.  Spinal fusion [**2138-11-7**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old
man with a past medical history significant for hypertension,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, sick sinus syndrome, status
post pacer in [**2134**], left lower lobe pneumonia and
polypectomy.  He also has a past medical history significant
for hernia repair times three, transurethral resection of
prostate, left total knee replacement and lumbosacral
decompression for spinal stenosis in [**2130**]. The patient fell
approximately a week prior to admission and had upper back
and neck pain.  A CT at that time was negative.  He was
diagnosed with a left lower lobe pneumonia and treated with
Levaquin.  The patient continued with syncopal episodes and
fell on the night prior to admission.

On the day of admission, in the PCP's office the patient had
a syncopal episode with a blood pressure in the 50's.  He was
unresponsive for several minutes but had a carotid pulse.  He
was transferred to [**Hospital3 3834**] which CT of the C-spine
revealed a C6 fracture.  Solu Medrol was bolused and started
as a drip.  The patient was unable to move his lower
extremities, was insensitive from above the nipple to his
toes.  He had minimal motor function in his bilateral upper
extremities and complained of C-spine pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
3.  Sick sinus syndrome.
4.  Pacer [**2134**].
5.  Left lower lobe pneumonia.
6.  Tachybrady syndrome.
7.  Syncope.
8.  Hearing loss.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Sigmoid polypectomy.
2.  Hernia repair times three.
3.  Transurethral resection of prostate.
4.  Left total knee replacement.
5.  Benign skin cancer removal on his forehead.
6.  Lumbosacral decompression for spinal stenosis.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Norvasc 5 mg once a day.
2.  Amiodarone 200 mg once a day.
3.  Coumadin three times a week.
4.  Klonopin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:
Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission the patient was afebrile
with normal vital signs.  His GCS was 15, his pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.  His
heart was irregular.  Lungs clear.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended.  He had decreased rectal tone and he
was heme positive.  He had no sensation from just above the
nipple line to his feet.  He was unable to move his trunk or
lower extremities.  He had bilateral upper extremity weakness
with 3/5 wrist extension and [**11-24**] grip.  His dorsalis pedis
pulses were palpable bilaterally.  He had no gross
deformities of his thoracic lumbar spine but was tender over
his cervical spine.

Of significance the patient's INR on admission was 5.1.  His
electrocardiogram was V-paced with no acute ischemia.

IMAGING:  CT of the spine showed a C6 burst fracture.  Chest
x-ray with a question of a right seventh rib fracture.
Pelvis x-ray:  No fracture.  TLS:  No fracture.  CT of
abdomen and pelvis was no free fluid negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was seen and evaluated by
Neurosurgery service in the Emergency Room.  He was felt to
have a C6 burst fracture and there was concern of an epidural
hematoma given the fact that the patient had a pacemaker he
was unable to undergo an magnetic resonance scan and was
therefore scheduled for a CT myelogram.  The patient was
given Factor VII emergently to reverse his anti-coagulation
as well as FFP.  He was resuscitated, access was obtained and
he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  The rest of
his hospital course will be done by systems.

1.  Neurologic.  The patient was seen and evaluated by
Neurosurgery.  He was taken to the operating room in the
early morning of [**2138-11-4**] for an evacuation of an epidural
hematoma and C6 corpectomy and cage placement.
Postoperatively the patient had little return of neurologic
function with minimum movement of his toes bilaterally and
triple flexion.  On [**2138-11-7**] the patient returned to the O.R.
for a posterior fusion.  Again, his neurologic postoperative
course showed minimal neurologic improvement.  The patient
was awake, alert and following commands and was transferred
out of bed to the chair throughout his postoperative course
when it was felt to be safe by Neurosurgery.

2.  Cardiovascular.  Given the fact that the patient had
several bouts of syncope prior to admission and had a history
of tachybrady syndrome, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation as
well as sick sinus syndrome he was seen and evaluated by the
Cardiology service.  His pacemaker was interrogated and felt
to be functioning fine.  He was kept on his home dose of
Amiodarone.  His cardiac enzymes were cycled and were found
to be negative.  Cardiology felt that no further intervention
was needed during his hospital course.

3.  Respiratory.  The patient was intubated in the operating
room for his first surgery and was extubated postop.  He had
an episode where he desated however and was felt to be unable
to maintain his respiratory drive.  He was therefore,
semi-electively reintubated on postop day zero.  The patient
had a prolonged ventilatory course and was unable to be
weaned off the ventilator despite diuresis, aggressive
pulmonary toilet and multiple bronchoscopies.  He was
admitted with a left lower lobe infiltrate and did spike
fevers throughout his hospital course that were felt to be
secondary to this infiltrate.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient had no issue from the
gastrointestinal standpoint.  He was started on tube feeds
and advanced to goal uneventfully.

5.  Genitourinary.  The patient had Foley throughout his
hospital course.  His urine output was adequate and he was
diuresed with Lasix with a good response.  He did have an
episode of hypernatremia and hyperkalemia and thus free water
was given to the patient with resolution of this problem.
[**Name (NI) 227**] his fever spikes his urine was cultured throughout his
hospital stay.
6.  Heme/Vascular.  Given the fact that the patient was
unable to be anti-coagulated and was felt to be high risk for
pulmonary embolism, an IVC filter was placed in the patient,
was done on [**2138-11-4**] without problem.  The patient's
coagulopathy was reversed with FFP.  Given the fact that the
patient continued to have recurrent fevers he underwent
bilateral lower extremity ultrasounds to rule out deep vein
thrombosis as well as upper extremity ultrasound at the site
of PICC line given his left upper extremity swelling.  His
lower extremity ultrasounds were negative but he did have a
left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis.  Vascular surgery
was consulted and given the fact that this was asymptomatic I
felt this could be treated conservatively.

7.  ID.  The patient was placed on Levofloxacin for left
lower lobe pneumonia when he was admitted.  Ancef was then
added for periop coverage given his prosthetic material in
his spine.  He continued to spike fevers throughout his
hospital course and on [**2138-11-13**] did grow out gram positive
rods in his sputum.  Otherwise, no clear source was found for
his fever.

8.  FEN.  As mentioned in gastrointestinal section the
patient was maintained on tube feeds.  He did have an episode
of hypernatremia and hyperkalemia which was treated with free
water.  His electrolytes were repleted as needed, otherwise
he had no issues.

9.  General Disposition:  Given the patient's inability to
wean off the vent and his family wishes on [**2138-11-17**] it was
dec
