Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Aortic Valve stenosis presenting for COREVALVE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
COREVALVE

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 112298**] is a 69 year old man with severe aortic stenosis,
CAD s/p stent to mid-LAD and D1 ([**2172**]), HTN, HLD, diabetes,
afib, and CKD, who presented for Corevalve.

Initial workup of his aortic stenosis revealed critical disease
with [**Location (un) 109**] 0.45cm2, mean gradient 55mmHg, EF 55-60%.  Cardiac cath
revealed
nonobstructive CAD and patent stent.  He was initially referred
for surgical AVR, and 9 weeks ago underwent sternotomy, where
epiaortic ultra sound revealed prohibitively calcified aorta and
procedure was aborted. He was then referred to [**Hospital1 2025**] for
evaluation for TAVR and was found to have large annulus.  He was
referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for treatment options. He was again deemed not
a surgical candidate due to heavily calcified aorta.  He met all
inclusion criteria for COREVALVE/TAVR and was admitted on [**2181-8-19**]
for the procedure.  Upon admission he endorsed SOB after walking
[**12-11**] mile and climbing 4 stairs, lightheadedness when getting out
of bed, and chest pressure when loading the car.

COREVALVE procedure took place the morning on [**2181-8-20**].  The
procedure went well aside from development of LBBB.

On arrival to the floor, patient was intubated and stable.

2-D ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2181-8-21**]:
Prevalve Implant

Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in
the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. There is severe symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate thickening of the
mitral valve chordae. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] were
notified in person of the results.

Postvalve implant

Corevalve seen in the aorticv position. It appears well seated.
There is mild perivalvular leak. Moderate mitral regurgitation
persists. The mean gradient across the mitral valve is 4 mm Hg.
There is some turbulence noted in the LVOT. Rest of the
examination is unchanged

DISCHARGE LABS:


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 69 yo man with critical symptomatic aortic
stenosis, history of CAD s/p stent to midLAD and D1 [**2172**], HLD,
DM, CKD, afib, HTN deemed not a surgical candidate for
conventional AVR due to heavily calcified aorta, now s/p
Corevalve.

1. Severe aortic stenosis admitted for COREVALVE.  Procedure
went well, no complications, pt was extubated in CCU
post-operatively without complications.  Right IJ was removed on
POD#2, patient was stable and called out to regular cardiology
floor.  His post-op course was overall uncomplicated.  However,
he spiked a fever to 101.1 on [**8-23**], blood and urine cultures
were sent and were no growth to date on the day of discharge.
Post-op ECHO on [**8-27**] showed a mildly dilated LA, markedly
dilated RA, moderate symmetric LVH.  Hyperdynamic LV systolic
function(EF>75%). There is a mild resting LVOFT obstruction. A
mid-cavitary gradient is identified. An aortic CoreValve
prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients. Mild (1+) AR/MR, mild PAH. There is no pericardial
effusion.  He will follow-up as planned with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as an
outpatient.

2. Diastolic heart failure - NYH Class II, LVEF >55%. BNP 55K.
Losartan was restarted once patient was extubated and off
pressors.  He was discharged on Losartan, aspirin, simvastatin,
and zetia. Standing diuretic not ordered as hypertrophic heart.
Oral fluids to be encouraged.

3. Atrial fibrillation: went into LBBB and afib during
procedure, but now natively conducting without narrow complex
QRS.  Sotalol was held for bradycardia and was not restarted
prior to discharge.  He was started on heparin drip while
holding coumadin.  The heparin gtt was discontinued, warfarin
was restarted at home dose and he was treated with Aspirin and
plavix until INR therapeutic and then plavix can be stopped.

4. CAD - (stent to midLAD and D1 [**2172**], patent), losartan, ASA,
vytorin and plavix as above.

5. HLD - continue ezetimibe/simvastatin, and heart healthy diet.
Simvastatin dose was reduced secondary to med interaction.

6. HTN - as noted above, he was initially on nitro gtt for
elevated blood pressures and then Losartan was restarted as
above. Plan to resume home benicar dose on discharge.

7. CKD -  metformin held during hospitalization, and all meds
were renally dosed. Glipizide 2.5mg started in place of
metformin. Patient to monitor blood glucose at home. BUN/Cr to
be drawn on [**8-29**].

8. DM - home metformin held, and he was started on insulin
sliding sca
