None


History of Present Illness:
69 yo male with extensive smoking history, recurrent squamous
cell lung cancer with hx of LLL lobectomy in the past, many
hospitalizations for COPD flares (2 L home O2 baseline), with hx
of intubations in the past, now presents in transfer from [**Hospital1 **] for palliative radiation therapy of recurrence of
squamous cell lung cancer with RLL mass with bronchial
obstruction, and SOB.  He had presented to [**Hospital3 **] with
hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring CPAP.

He was treated with Vancomycin and Pip/Tazo epirically, however
this was later discontinued after bronchoscopy as
post-obstructive pneumonia was thought less likely.

He underwent bronchoscopy on [**2176-1-2**] which revealed the RLL
mass obstructing the bronchus.  Biopsy was taken and revealed
moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.

Pt currently denies subjective SOB at rest, but admits to
significant dyspnea with minimal exertion.  +cough, moderately
productive white sputum.  States breathing worse with lying
down.  Has had difficulty with urination, with difficulty
starting and maintaining stream, and some burning with the
effort.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo male with hx of severe COPD with hx of hospitalizations
requiring intubations in the past, squamous cell lung cancer
with hx of LLL lobectomy, presents in transfer from [**Hospital1 **] s/p episode of hypercarbic respiratory failure.
Complete records from [**Hospital1 **] are not currently available,
however, it appears that during that hospitalization an ABG
revealed pCO2 of 95, although it is not clear if that was his
peak.  He does require BiPAP at night with settings [**11-24**] with 14
backup rate, and 30% FIO2 to maintain O2 sat between 88 and 92%.
 During that hospitalization, he was treated with CPAP and
underwent bronchoscopy for concern of RLL collapse which
revealed mass obstructing the bronchus, and was confirmed to
have recurrence of squamous cell cancer.  Patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for radiation therapy per recommendations
of their pulmonary consult, despite requesting transfer to [**Hospital1 112**]
where his oncologist is.
.
# Severe COPD, CO2 retention
Floor course unclear, however patient was initially admitted to
the floor, where BIPAP was not started.  Overnight [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] staff
was called to take the patient to the unit, secondary to
elevated CO2 and evidence of CO2 narcosis.  Patient was taken to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where he was placed on standing nebs, and he was placed
on BIPAP.  While on nighttime bipap his mental status improved,
he began speaking coherently and became A+Ox3.  On exam some
evidence of CO2 toxicity persists.  As definitive treatment of
this issue would be relief of dead space via XRT of his
obstructing SCC, and because his oncological care is at the
[**Hospital1 84145**] transfer to [**Hospital1 112**] for initiation of XRT was undertaken.
.
Plan going forward:
- Transfer to [**Hospital1 112**] for XRT
- Continue NEBS
- Continue BIPAP at 12/5 with 14 backup rate, and 30% FIO2 to
maintain O2 sat between 88 and 92%
.
# Squamous cell cancer, with RLL mass/RLL collapse
Bronchoscopically evaluated at [**Hospital1 **], found to have SCC
obstructing bronchus intermedius.
.
Plan going forward
-Transfer to [**Hospital1 756**] for continuity of care
-XRT as above
.
# BPH with hx of retention
- We continued his flomax
.
# Hx of dCHF (EF 50-55%)
- Per records, pt no longer on betablocker, diuretics, or other
cardiac medications, he never displayed signs of volume
overload.
