History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname 3065**] [**Known lastname 82948**] is a very nice 60 year-old gentleman with
prior history of schizofrenia, CAD, systolic CHF, DM, COPD,
alcohol abuse, hepatic encephalopathy who was sent from NH
Bejamin HC center with SOB and AMS. Of note, Pt reportedly was
admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] hospital in [**Hospital1 1474**] 1 week ago
because he was experiencing increased anxiety/panic attacks. The
pt sisters feel that this was precipitated by the anniversary of
his father's death 1 year ago which he took very hard. When he
experienced the increased anxiety his medications were adjusted,
but he became drowsy, drooling, incontinent so he was
hospitalized and the medications were titrated back down. He was
D/C'd [**7-24**] back to his NH continent and with increased energy.
However, he started to decline a few days later with difficulty
speaking/confusion/decreased short term memory, he had
complained of SOB and gotten albuterol INH at nrsing home. Per
nursing home nurse, felt increased abdominal distention
recently.Pt was noted to be oriented x1 and confused and was
sent to the ER.
.
In the ED vitals were: 98.3 97/63 69 20 97% RA. His sodium was
122 after fluids with a potassium of 5.7. EKG with LBBB and ST
depressions 2,3,AVG, and cardiac enzymes were negative. Lactate
was 2.3, WBC 12.9, INR 1.7, UA negative, CXR negative, CT of the
abdomen showed ascities with enlarged prtostate, distended
bladder and dislocated right prostethic hip. Pt received lithium
and lactulose, 1 L NS bolus, clozapine 200 mg, pentoxyfylline SR
400 mg in ER and was admitted to medicine serivce. Blood
cultures were sent.
.
On the floor his vitals were: 97.1 90/60 76 24 96% om RA.
Shortly after arriving pt triggeter for hypoxia up to SpO2 60%
on RA. he was suctioned and put on NRB. He was transfered to the
MICU.
.
In the MICU patient's VS were: HR 76, BP 118/84 mmHg, RR 12 x',.
SpO2 100%, Temp 96.2 F. Patient appeared with cold and clammy
extremities. He was not following commands. He was given IVF
boluses with isotonic bicarbonate (2 L), intubated without
immediate return of SaO2 and emergent bedside fiberoptic
pronchoscopy. He had RIJ placed with a CVP of ~25 mmHG with x
and y descents but no large v wave. Pt was started on levophed.
Then, emergent cardiac echocardiogram showed normal LV thickness
with severely dilated LV and global hypokinesis and EF of ~15%.
RV was moderately dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis and signs of volume overload. There was [**Month/Year (2) 1192**] to
severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**] TR. There wasn't any pericardial
effusion. Patient underwent a PE-CT that rueld out PE and
showed. At this point, patient was transfered to CCU team for
amazing cardiovascular care.
.
Of note, Liver service was consulted in regards to LFTs with AST
of 451, ALT 1134 and a ratio of 2.5 with AP 63, TB 4.0. Trauma
consulted re: dislocated hip, but patient refuset going to x-ray
or sedation to have it re-positioned.
.

<br>
On review of systems (per records), he denies any prior history
of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain.
All of the other review of systems were negative.
<br>
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Cultures: Pending

Studies:
ECHO ([**2197-7-31**]): The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated
with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets do not fully coapt.
