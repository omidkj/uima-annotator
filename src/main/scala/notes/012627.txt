HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85-year-old
female with an extensive past medical history as noted above
for whom the Surgery Service was consulted after a 7-day
history of melena.

She was initially admitted to the hospital under the Medicine
Service for a workup of this, and when she came in she
actually had a hematocrit of 21.  After a Gastroenterology
workup, it was eventually found that she had a
malignant-appearing lesion in the proximal ascending colon
with some arteriovenous malformations, and a cecal polyp, and
diverticulosis.

Therefore, she underwent a Surgery Service evaluation.  After
examining the patient and reviewing the images, it was felt
that a right colectomy would be the best course of treatment
for this patient given her cardiac history.  However, given
her cardiac history she needed cardiac clearance which was
obtained preoperatively.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  In terms of her
admission laboratories, as noted, when she came in her
hematocrit was 19.3 at first check; for which she had
multiple transfusions.  Otherwise, when she came in her blood
urea nitrogen and creatinine were 32 and 1.5; respectively.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  In terms of her
initial examination on the Surgery Service, she was afebrile,
her pulse was 68, her blood pressure was 156/74, her
respiratory rate was 22, and she was saturating 98% on room
air.  Otherwise, she was in no acute distress.  She had a
regular rate and rhythm.  She had a 1/6 systolic ejection
murmur, but was otherwise clear.  Her abdomen was soft and
nondistended.  There was no hepatomegaly or ascites fluid
wave appreciated.  The extremities were warm and without
edema.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient's initial hospital
course, as noted above, but on [**2152-3-17**] after cardiac
clearance she underwent a right colectomy without note in
intraoperative complications or excessive blood loss.  The
patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit postoperatively
for close monitoring of her hemodynamic status and her
cardiac status.  She actually did fairly well while she was
in the Postanesthesia Care Unit and did not have any notable
cardiac events.
