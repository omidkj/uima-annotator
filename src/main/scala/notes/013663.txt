Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea and LE edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
echocardiogram


History of Present Illness:
62 year old male with chief complaint of shortness of breath,
increased leg swelling for the last several weeks as well as
diarrhea and abdominal pain. He has had dyspnea on exertion and
orthopnea for 2.5 months and increasing lower extremities edema
x3 weeks. No previous history of LE edema. He was previously on
HCTZ 25mg daily but this was stopped ~2.5 months ago because his
physician felt he was getting dehydrated.
.
He also has chronic abdominal pain and diarrhea as well as a 60
lbs weight loss. In [**Month (only) **] he was diagnosed with Crohn's
disease (had a colonoscopy in [**Location (un) 7349**]). He has also had multiple
anal abscess that need to be drained.
.
In the ED his initial VS were: T 98.7 P 100 BP 120/74 R O2 sat
86/ra. He was briefly hypoxic to the 80s. He was also noted to
have diffuse abdominal tenderness. A CT was performed given his
past history of abdominal abscesses which was negative for any
acute infection, however a CXR showed
.
He was given 40mg IV lasix and put out ~1.5L with some
improvement in his oxygenation. He was also given 750mg Levoquin
and 500mg Flagyl with concern for an aspiration PNA followed by
a 1gm of CTX. Given his overall degree of hypoxia he was
admitted to the ICU for further management. At the time of
transfer he was breathing 95% on a venti face mask.
.
On arrival in the ICU he was in mild respiratory distress,
otherwise hemodynamically stable, and alert and oriented x3.

   GRAM STAIN (Final [**2188-12-13**]):
      <10 PMNs and >10 epithelial cells/100X field.
      Gram stain indicates extensive contamination with upper
respiratory
      secretions. Bacterial culture results are invalid.
      PLEASE SUBMIT ANOTHER SPECIMEN.

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2188-12-13**]):
      TEST CANCELLED, PATIENT CREDITED.

   Immunoflourescent test for Pneumocystis jirovecii (carinii)
(Final
      [**2188-12-15**]):
      POSITIVE FOR PNEUMOCYSTIS JIROVECII (CARINII).
.
CXR (Portable AP) [**2188-12-12**]:
FINDINGS: AP portable upright view of the chest is obtained.
Diffuse parenchymal opacities are noted which are more notable
in the lower lungs.  The overall appearance is suggestive of
pulmonary edema though the possibility of pneumonia cannot be
entirely excluded. Given the relative sparing of the upper
lungs, the possibility of underlying emphysema is considered. No
large pleural effusions or definite sign of pneumothorax is
seen. A rounded structure projects over the right mid lung which
is likely external to the patient. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
is normal. Bones appear intact.

IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of pulmonary edema, though
cannot exclude
pneumonia.
.
CT Abdomen/Pelvis [**2188-12-12**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute CT findings in the abdomen or pelvis.
2. Ground-glass opacities in both lungs may represent pulmonary
edema,
inflammatory and/or infectious disease.
3. Fatty infiltration of the submucosa of the ascending [**Month/Day/Year 499**],
cecum, and
terminal ileum compatible with history of Crohn's disease. No
evidence of
acute Crohn's flare.
.
TTE [**2188-12-13**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with probable mild hypokinesis of the basal to mid
inferior septum. Due to suboptimal technical quality, other
focal wall motion abnormalities cannot be fully excluded. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits). The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.


IMPRESSION: poor technical quality. The basal to mid inferior
septum is probably hypokinetic, other focal wall motion
abnormalityies cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is
not well seen. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen.
Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
