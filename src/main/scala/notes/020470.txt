none

History of Present Illness:
63M transferred in, melanoma s/p resection, now on INF p/w acute
SOB to [**Hospital3 417**] Hosp yesterday. After interferon infusion
yesterday, he went home feeling ??????drained,?????? as he usually does
after treatments, and stayed in bed most of the afternoon. He
went out with his wife for dinner, still feeling very tired, and
also short of breath, especially with mild exertion. When he
came home that night, he found it difficult to get to sleep, as
he was short of breath both lying flat and propped up on as many
as 5 pillows. He puttered around the house, urinated, but felt
no better, so had his wife take him to the hospital.



He endorses DOE but not orthopnea; there does not seem to be any
positional component to the dyspnea. There is no cough or
coryza. There has been no chest pain, no palpitations, and no
diaphoresis. He does note significant anxiety at the recent loss
of his sister, whose funeral is planned for Saturday, and
describes increasing anxiety since starting interferon therapy.



CT at OSH suspicious for RUL pna, so received got levoflox and
transferred here. 95% on 2L, T100.3, broadened to zosyn here.



In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was in afib, 120s-130s with BP 110s.  EF was
40-45% in [**2150**] according to recent cardiologist??????s note. Of note,
coumadin was held last night.



Access PIV. Also has tunneled LSC line for chemo.


Past Medical History:

(began [**2153-3-21**]). originally presented with lesion on his back
that was appeared to be a basal cell in [**2147**], recurred and was
resected again in [**2148**], but he eventually developed a melanotic,
raised lesion at the resection site, which was diagnosed as
melanoma in [**2152-11-4**] with bilateral lymph node involvement
confirmed in [**2152-12-5**]. Completed course of XRT to R axilla in
[**Month (only) 958**].

coronaries [**2148-1-6**]. Last echo [**2150**] EF 45% with mild-mod MR

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: assess stability

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
63 year old man with RUL opacity after interferon treatment
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess stability
PROCEDURE: Chest portable AP on [**2153-4-13**].

COMPARISON: [**2153-4-12**].

HISTORY: 63-year-old man with right upper lobe opacity after
interferon treatment, evaluate for stability.

FINDINGS:
The right upper lobe opacity has remained stable. However, on
today's examination, there is an ill-defined opacity in the
right lower lung, more conspicuous. The left lung is clear.
Heart size is normal. No effusions are seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. Stable right upper lobe opacity and more conspicuous right
lower lung opacity worrisome for multifocal pneumonia.

The information on this report has been placed on the radiology
dashboard board to be conveyed to the referring physician.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: please evalute progression of infiltrate

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
63 year old man with IIIC melanoma s/p IV IFN admitted with Afib
with RVR, pulm infiltrate. Hx of XRT
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please evalute progression of infiltrate
PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**4-14**].

HISTORY: Advanced melanoma. Atrial fibrillation.

IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**4-13**]:

Lungs are fully expanded and are clear. The heart is normal in
size and there is no pleural effusion. Central venous line ends
in the mid SVC.


Brief Hospital Course:
63M with metastatic melanoma s/p resection and axillary XRT
receiving interferon therapy, also  presents with 2 days
shortness of breath and rapid afib
.

# shortness of breath: CTA from outside hospital did not show PE
of pericardial effusion. His SOB was thought secondary to atrial
fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, in addition to CHF
exacerbation, and RUL infiltrate concerning for pneumonia.
Patient was diuresed with lasix, his atrial fibrillation was
rate controlled with metoprolol, and he was treated with
antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia. The patient's
shortness of breath resolved.

# rapid afib: Patient's outpatient digoxin was c
