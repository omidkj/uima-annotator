MRI brain


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 80 yo RHW with h/o AF not on coumadin, seizure,
who presents with L hemiparesis and dysarthria, transferred from
[**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] post tPA.
The patient was last seen normal at 20:50 tonight sitting on
couch. When family saw her again at 9:20, she was slurring her
speech and had a left facial droop. She was taken to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]
where NIHSS was [**7-31**] (1 for best gaze, 1 for hemianopia, 2 facial
weakness, 2 left arm weakness, 2 dysarthria). She had a negative
head CT, she was in A fib. She was given tPA 0.1/kg at 22:26.
She
improved within 15 minutes, in terms of L sided weakness and
dysarthria. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. On arrival, NIHSS 3 for
dysarthria and facial droop. VSS. She denies headache, nausea or
visual changes.
Her family thinks her speech and facial droop have improved. The
patient c/o difficulty controlling her saliva.

MRI BRAIN
IMPRESSION:
1. Right frontal infarct within the MCA territory. Peripheral
foci suggest
an embolic origin.
2. No evidence for hemorrhage.
3. Possible high-grade stenoses in the superior and inferior M2
divisions of
the right MCA; however, it is difficult to determine if this is
due to
artifact. CTA is recommended for better evaluation.
4. Left MCA bifurcation aneurysm, which could be better
evaluated with CTA.
5. Stable right frontal meningioma

CTA head and neck: PRELIMINARY REPORT: Provided by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11623**],
who noted "left middle cerebral
bifurcation 2-mm aneurysm (series 400B, image 21). Right middle
cerebral
artery branches patent. Posterior circulation intact. Calcified
atherosclerotic disease at the aortic arch, bilateral carotid
artery
bifurcations, and cavernous portions of bilateral internal
carotid arteries.
Right middle cerebral artery branch distribution
hypodensity-evolving infarct
(series 2, image 18). Bilateral paranasal sinus disease. Stable
right
frontal meningioma."

FINDINGS: I concur with Dr.[**Name (NI) 35577**] observations. There is a
question of a second 2-mm aneurysm arising just distal to the
bifurcation of the right
middle cerebral artery, also noted on image 21, series 400B,
which has a
fairly concentric, infundibular like relationship to a sylvian
branch of the right middle cerebral artery (see series 3, image
257). The major vascular
tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] are patent.

CONCLUSION: No definite intracranial vascular occlusive
processes. Two tiny, bilaterally symmetrically positioned middle
cerebral artery aneurysms.  Regarding management of the
aneurysms, consultation with the endovascular neurosurgery
service (Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **]) is advised.


Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo RHW with h/o AF and seizure presented with acute onset L
hemiparesis, L facial droop and dysarthria, now s/p t-[**Hospital1 35578**]
[**Location (un) 620**] with improvement of deficits. Etiology is most likely
cardioembolic, since she had AF not on coumadin due to gait
instability. Localization is most likely
subcortical given face/arm/leg weakness and no cortical signs.
Neurologic examination on  admission currently significant for L
deltoid weakness, dysarthria and L facial droop, which is
consistent withright subcortical infarct. She also has
diminished position/vibration sense, hyporeflexia and upgoing
toes, which
may be due to peripheral neuropathy and known cervical
myelopathy. She was stable post-tPA and we admitted for
monitoring overnight in the neuro ICU.

Neuro: She did well in the ICU and was transferred to the floor.
