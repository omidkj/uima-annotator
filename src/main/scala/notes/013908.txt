Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**]
Chief Complaint:
Newly diagnosed biliary ductal mass - noted to be consistent
with cholangiocarcinoma, initially here for PTC placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2187-9-24**]:  Internal-external drain placement in the right
anterior and left intrahepatic biliary system and external drain
placement in the right posterior biliary system.
[**2187-9-25**]: Successful uncomplicated coiling of a small bleeding
branch of the a left hepatic artery.

hematoma, cholecystectomy, intraoperative ultrasound.
[**2187-10-5**]: Cholangiogram with internalization of R. posterior PTC


History of Present Illness:
Per Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4727**] note, this is a 52 y/o woman who presented with
painless jaundice and pruritus.  She was noted to have elevated
liver function tests including alkaline phosphatase of 325 and a
bilirubin of 19.5.  CT scan of the abdomen on [**9-7**],
demonstrated intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation of the left
lobe with abrupt cutoff at the porta hepatis suspicious for
cholangiocarcinoma.  A followup triphasic CT scan of the abdomen
on [**9-17**], demonstrated invasive tumor in the hilum of the
liver suggestive of cholangiocarcinoma.  She had a replaced
right hepatic artery. She had intrahepatic biliary dilatation
that was more severe on the left compared to the right.  There
was an infiltrating mass measuring 2 cm in extent of the hilum,
suspicious for cholangiocarcinoma.  There was early branching
off the right posterior portal vein which was mildly narrowed by
the tumor. More distally, however, the proximal right anterior
and left main portal veins were thought to be occluded with more
distal reconstitution beyond the hilum.  The tumor also involves
the origin of the left main hepatic duct and all segmental
biliary ducts in the right lobe appear separately occluded by
the mass near the hilum.  The anterior right segment of the
liver, especially segment VIII, are mildly atrophic with
prominent intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and attenuated
in segment portal branches and associated increased compensatory
arterial enhancement.
There may be tumor infiltration of the central portion of the
anterior segments with lesser involvement suspected along the
posterior segments. There was no definite tumor involvementin
left lobe parenchyma.  She did not have adenopathy that was
suspicious for metastatic disease.  On further review, it
appeared there was narrowing of the main left portal vein, but
it was not occluded. An ERCP demonstrated a malignant- appearing
stricture at the bifurcation extending to the left and right
main hepatic ducts with upstream dilatation.  She was
subsequently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] where she underwent percutaneous
transhepatic cholangiography.  She had placement of transhepatic
catheters in the right anterior, right posterior and left
hepatic ducts.  She appeared to have more
extensive involvement on the right side.  The involvement of the
left hepatic duct was approximately 2-3 mm above the confluence
of the left and right hepatic ducts.  She had bleeding from a
branch of the left hepatic artery after the PTC requiring
embolization of a small branch of the left hepatic artery
supplying the left lateral segment (segments II and III).  She
did have a large intra-abdominal hematoma demonstrated on CT
scan. She did develop some ischemia of the left lateral segment
with a rise in transaminases and also a small infarct
demonstrated on CT scan post embolization. Her bilirubin has
also increased from a nadir of 10.1 to 22.8.  At the same time,
her transhepatic
catheters were drained of bilious fluid well.  The rising
bilirubin was thought to either be representative of absorption
of the hematoma or compromised liver function post embolization
or a combination.

Brief Hospital Course:
52 year old female admitted with jaundice, and status post ERCP
demonstrating an intra-hepatic biliary mass concerning for
cholangiocarcinoma. Initially her admissison was for placement
of percutaneous biliary drains. On [**2187-9-24**] she went for
placement of the drains and she underwent successful placement
of internal-external biliary drainage catheters in the right
anterior and left hepatic ducts, and external drainage catheter
in the right posterior intrahepatic biliary ducts. They were
unable to push through the ERCP stent that had been placed
earlier.

The patient's post-procedure course was complicated by blood
noted in her drains and transfer to the ICU for hemodynamic
instability (Hct of 23.7) secondary to bleeding from a small
branch of the L. hepatic artery (likely trangressed along the
course of the L. PTBD catheter). 8 units of PRBCS were
transfused as well as 3 units of FFP. The bleeding vessel was
localized on angiogram and successfully coil embolized by IR on
[**2187-9-25**]. The L. PTBD catheter was repositioned and shown to be
in good position at the end of the procedure. She was extubated
the following day, weaned off all pressors, advanced to a clear
liquid diet, and transferred out of the ICU back to the floors.
The patient continued to do well post-procedure with no further
evidence of bleed although she remained visibly jaundiced. She
was noted to develop some ischemia of the left lateral segment
of her liver with a rise in transaminases, and a small infarct
was demonstrated on CT scan ([**2187-9-28**]) post-embolization. Her
bilirubin has also increased from a nadir of 10.1 to 22.8
although her transhepatic catheters were draining bilious fluid
well.  The rising bilirubin was thought to either be
representative of absorption of the intra-abdominal hematoma
caused by her L. hepatic artery bleed, possibly secondary to
compromised liver function post-embolization or a combination of
both. She was advanced to a regular diet on [**2187-9-29**] (day #4
post-placement of PTCs) and placed on a regimen of 40mg IV Lasix
twice daily for lower extremity swelling/edema.

On [**2187-10-1**] (hospital day #7) the patient was taken to the OR for
for exploratory laparotomy, evacuation of intra-abdominal
hematoma, cholecystectomy, and possible common bile duct
excision, possible right hepatic lobectomy, possible Roux-en-Y
hepaticojejunostomy, and possible lymph node dissection.
Intra-operatively ultrasound demonstrated the mass at the hilum
with involvement of the right anterior and right posterior
portal veins and with s
