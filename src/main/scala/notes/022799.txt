Studies:

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2142-4-29**]
10:59 PM
IMPRESSION:
Bibasal lung findings, most likely due to aspiration or or
developing
infection

Radiology Report CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of
[**2142-4-30**] 1:43 AM
IMPRESSION: Limited exam, due to lack of oral contrast, paucity
of
intra-abdominal fat, motion, and arm placement.
1. No definite acute intra-abdominal process. If high suspicion
for
diverticulitis, can repeat exam with oral contrast.
2. Bibasilar consolidations either represent atelectasis,
aspiration, or
pneumonia.
3. T10 compression fracture, age indeterminant but new since PET
CT on
[**2138-10-2**], with mild retropulsion. Clinical correlation is
advised.
4. 1.0 cm hyperenhancing lesion in right lobe of liver and
moderate
intrahepatic biliary duct dilitation is unchanged.
5. Left adnexal cystic structure is slightly increased in size.
Pelvic US can be done to further evaluate.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2142-5-1**] 3:57 AM

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung
volumes have
decreased. The pre-existing scars persist, but newly appeared
opacities at
both lung bases are concerning for interval recurrence of
pneumonia. In
addition, the presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot
be excluded.
The size of the cardiac silhouette and the mild elevation of the
left
hemidiaphragm are unchanged.



Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION: Patient is an 81F with
multiple medical problems, including recurrent [**Name (NI) **] UTIs and
Cdiff colitis who presented with hypoxia, chills and productive
cough and found to have a PNA and UTI.

ACUTE CARE:

# Healthcare Acquired PNEUMONIA:
Patient had a clinical presentation c/w PNA - productive cough,
chills, new hypoxia and leukocytosis. CXR showed bibasilar
opacities concerning for PNA. Patient was treated originally
with CTX/azithro/Flagyl but switched to Vanc/Cefepime.  Her
respiratory status improved greatly during her stay in the MICU
and she was weaned from her O2 requirement as tolerated and
transferred to the medicine floor. Prior to discharge her
antibiotics were switched to PO Levofloxacin to finish an 8 day
course and she remained afebrile and her leukocytosis resolved.

# UTI: On admission, patient had a grossly positive UA, with Lg
Leuks, >182 WBC, mod bacteria. Her urine cx was contaminated and
not interpretable. She received 1 dose ceftriaxone in the ED and
was switched to Vancomycin/cefepime. Rehab notes show pt has hx
multiple [**Name (NI) **] UTIs. A [**Name (NI) **] swab was performed and negative. She no
longer complained of dysuria following initiation of
antibiotics.

# LLQ ABDOMINAL PAIN
Patient presented with 8/10 abd pain and LLQ tenderness on exam
in the ED, concerning for diverticulitis. She was empirically
started on antibiotics which would cover abdominal source. Pt
underwent CT abd/pelvis in the ED, which did not show acute
findings. Abdominal exam on arrival in the MICU revealed diffuse
abdominal tenderness and tense abdominal wall muscles. The pt
was not interested in surgical interventions so a surgical
consult was deferred. Final CT read showed no definite
intra-abdominal process and antibiotics were changed to
Vancomycin/cefepime. Her abdominal pain resolved quickly on
arrival to the u
