IMAGING:
[**9-15**] Thoracic CT:Multilevel metastatic disease, affecting the
left side of the T6 vertebral body, causing significant left
side neural foraminal narrowing and impinging the thecal sac.
Pathological compression fracture is identified at T7 without
evidence of significant retropulsion. Metastatic lesion is noted
at the transverse process of T9 on the right and bone marrow
infiltration with expansion at the T10 vertebral body on the
right, causing right-sided neural foraminal narrowing.

[**9-15**] CXR: Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. Right IJ
catheter tip is in the right brachiocephalic vein. There is no
evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Posterior spinal
fusion hardware device is noted. Tube with tip in the distal
esophagus is noted. The lungs are clear.

ECG [**2151-9-16**]  9:13:30 AM
Sinus rhythm. Low limb lead QRS voltage is non-specific. Tracing
is otherwise within normal limits. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2151-9-13**] the rate is faster, ventricular ectopy is
absent and low limb lead QRS voltage is now seen.

ECG [**2151-9-17**]  7:27:36 AM
Probable multifocal atrial tachycardia at a rate of
approximately 118 with
ventricular premature beats and ventricular couplets. Low
voltage in the
standard leads. Non-specific anteroseptal repolarization
abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2151-9-13**] multifocal atrial
tachycardia is new and the ventricular rate has increased from
approximately 75 to
approximatley 115. Ventricular ectopy persists.

 ECG [**2151-9-17**]  8:50:02 PM
Probable atrial tachycardia with 1:1 conduction and one
ventricular premature beat seen. Poor R wave progression.
Consider prior anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Low limb lead
voltages. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2151-9-17**] the rhythm
appears to be more consistent with an atrial tachycardia rather
than multfifocal atrial tachycardia. The findings are broadly
similar.

CXR [**2151-9-18**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-17**], there is little
overall
change. Cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits and
there is no
evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or acute focal
pneumonia.

CXR [**2151-9-21**]
FINDINGS: Interpretation of the study is limited due to motion
artifacts.
Slight increase of cardiac left opacity, consistent with
atelectasis. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila are normal. The lungs are
clear without
pleural pathology. Intact and unchanged thoracic spine
instrumentation. IMPRESSION: There is no acute cardiopulmonary
process.















Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 73M with PMH significant for HCC, who
presented on [**9-15**] for an elective procedure to address the
lesion identifed to T6. He underwent a T6 vertebrectomy and
T3-11 fusion with ICBG. In the recovery room, he had some
tachycardia and cardiac enzymes were negative. Metoprolol was
ordered. He received 6U PRBC's and FFP intraoperatively. Post
procedure Hct was stable at 29-30. On [**9-16**] he was transfered to
the regular floor. He was neurologically intact. He had some B
UE edema.He had JP drain that was removed [**9-17**]. On morning of
[**9-17**] he had tachycardia with SBP to 80s, found to have new onset
a fib - cards consult called and pt was transferred to CCU for
closer monitoring

Postoperativelt he was noted to be in afib with rvr refractory
to IV lopressor and diltiazem. His HR was still elevated to
120s-140s.amiodarone therapy initiated, with 150 mg IV bolus and
then 1 mg/min for 6 hours, then 0.5 mg/min for 18 hours. He
converted to NSR at a HR=75 on this regimen and po amiodorone
was started. He was transferred back to stepdown unit [**9-19**] for
tachycardia requiring intermittent lopressor or amiodarone bolus
and IVF

On [**9-20**] he had tachycardia to 150's and cardiology was
reconsulted. They recommended lopressor 400mg [**Hospital1 **] x1wk, then 200
mg daily for 1 wk. His primary care doctore can discontinue this
medicine if necesary. He was started on Aspririn and he was
cleared to start coumadin at 4 weeks post-op per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**]. On
[**9-21**] he was getting lopressor prn. He had some tachycardia over
night when transfering to commode, this improved on [**9-22**]. He had
some ptiiting edema in all four extremities which improved when
his HCTZ was restarted. He continued to get PT and OT but was
still too weak to stand ind for x-rays. He has no focal motor
deficit. Serial chest X-rays were satisfactory. UO was being
monitored and Foley catheter was left in place for this reason.
He was medically cleared for transfer to rehab and he was
transfered on [**9-23**].
