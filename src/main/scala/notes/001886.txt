Tetracycline

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 530**]
Chief Complaint:
syncopal event

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
hemodialysis via left arm A-V graft


History of Present Illness:
This is a 56 yo F with HTN, h/o atypical thrombotic
microangiopathy with secondary focal sclerosis off [**First Name3 (LF) **] for
the last year, hepatitis B and C, hypothyroidism here with
syncopal event and acute renal failure, now with hypotension of
unclear etiology. Patient is a poor historian, but states that
she fell on tuesday because she tripped over a wire and hit her
bottom and her head. [**First Name3 (LF) 2974**], she had another fall with unclear
circumstances because she can't remember what happened per ED.
She denied cp, sob, palpatations, etc prior to this event. She
complains of left leg pain. She has erythema and serous blisters
over L hip with hematoma. Labs done in the ED reveal a
creatinine of 8.8 which is up from a baseline of [**3-9**].5 with some
values [**6-10**]. Her BUN is also elevated at 65. Pt reports some
decreased po intake for unclear reasons and decreased urination.
She denies using nsaids, vomiting, diarrhea. She is on
diuretics. Pt denies metallic taste in her mouth, pruritis,
frothy urine, nausea or vomiting. She is not confused.

In the ED, initial vs were T 98.6, HR 92, BP 126/71, R 18, O2
sat 99% RA. Head CT negative. CXR negative. EKG non-ischemic and
unchanged from prior. Labs notable for creatinine 8.8 with bun
65.

On the floor, patient slept comfortably and ate well. She denies
LOC.

AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: No consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural
effusion. Cardiomegaly and central pulmonary vascular congestion
are present, although without evidence of overt edema. The
mediastinum and hila are within normal limits. Tandem vascular
stents are seen within the right subclavian and brachiocephalic
veins and proximal SVC.

AP PELVIS AND FIVE VIEWS OF THE LEFT FEMUR.

There is no fracture or dislocation. Calcific density is seen
adjacent to the greater tuberosity on a single projection which
likely represents calcific gluteal tendinopathy. Vascular
calcifications are present. Limited views of the knee show
tricompartmental osteoarthritis

EKG:
Sinus rhythm. Delayed precordial R wave transition. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2200-6-28**] no diagnostic interim change.
The rate has slowed.

Transthoracic Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrial volume is
markedly increased (>32ml/m2). The right atrium is moderately
dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-15mmHg. There
is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is
normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic
dysfunction. There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at
rest or with Valsalva. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased
transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2198-9-27**],
the left ventricle is more hypertrophied and the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure has increased. No vegetation
is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: A/P: Pt is a 56 yo female with pmhx thrombotic
microangiopathy, CKD, HTN here with several syncopal episodes
and acute on chronic renal failure
.
# Transient Hypotension: On arrival to floor from ED, patient's
blood pressure was low, responded to reducing dose of methadone
from 20 to 10, gentle hydration with isotonic bicarbonate, and
holding BP meds x24 hrs. Stable since on home amlodipine and
metoprolol.

# systolic murmur: Patient also has a harsh murmur, which raises
suspicion for endocarditis, but is afebrile and aside from
hypotension, does not manifest signs of infection. TTE was
normal, with no veg or hemodynamically significant LV outflow
obstruction or AS; suspect aortic sclerosis.

# Acute on chronic renal failure: UOP low initially but pt now
making 500-600cc/day. Baseline Cr 2-3.5 secondary to TTP, peaked
at 10.4 and hemodialysis re-initiated. Suspect [**3-8**]
rhabdomyolysis given elevated CPK on admission. Blood
bank/[**Month/Day (2) **] team did not find any indications for [**Month/Day (2) **],
which was considered given patient's history of atypical
microangiopathy. Continued niferex, epogen, calcitriol at outpt
doses.

Pt will need HD on a Tues/Thurs/Sat schedule with ongoing
re-evaluation of need for hemodialysis.

# Fall, ? Syncope: Pt denies LOC and insists fall was
mechanical. CT head without acute bleed. She did have 14 beats
of VT on telemetry in ICU, asymptomatic (see below), no known
structural heart disease, but with murmur. Also could be renal
failure causing increased circulating levels of methadone.
- ECHO to evaluate for structural heart disease in setting of
murmur was normal
- TSH slightly high, T4 slightly low; increased levothyroxine to
75 mcg daily

# HTN- restarting norvasc and metoprolol

# hypothyroidism- increased levothyroxine to 75 mcg d
