CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST

Reason: CT abd and pelvis w/p.o. and IV contrast, please
evaluate fo
Field of view: 43 Contrast: OPTIRAY

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
16 year old man POD4 s/p L diaphragmatic laceration repair
secondary to stab wound
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
CT abd and pelvis w/p.o. and IV contrast, please evaluate for
intraabdominal injury
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

EXAMINATION: CT abdomen and pelvis.

INDICATION: Status post stab wound to left upper quadrant.
Evaluate for intra-abdominal injury.

COMPARISON: No old CT available for comparison.

TECHNIQUE: CT of abdomen and pelvis was performed with axial
images taken from the lung bases to the symphysis pubis. Oral
and IV contrast was administered. Reconstructions were performed
in the coronal and sagittal planes.

CT ABDOMEN FINDINGS: Some bowel is situated in the left
hemithorax adjacent to the heart. Note is made of a left pleural
effusion and associated atelectasis. Some right basilar
atelectasis is also noted. The left hemidiaphragm is raised
which may represent paresis in this patient status post left
diaphragmatic rupture and repair.

Within the abdomen, the liver is visualized and is normal. The
gallbladder is normal. The spleen is visualized and is normal.
The stomach is located anterior to the spleen and extends up
close to the left ventricle. Some contrast is identified within
the stomach. Just posterior to the stomach, there is some fluid
which superiorly appear closely adherent to the stomach but
inferiorly appears to represent a separate fluid collection
containing some air. This is located just anterior to the
inferior pole of the spleen. It measures approximately 8.6 cm in
transverse x 2.2 cm in AP diameter. At this site, on series 2,
image 9, it is technically very difficult to percutaneously
drain this fluid. This fluid is situated just superior to the
pancreas. Some peripancreatic fluid may be a postoperative
result; serial monitoring of the amylase is advised.

The adrenals and kidneys are normal. The pancreas is normal.

There is a significant amount of free intraperitoneal air, which
may be secondary to both the trauma of the stab wound and the
surgery. The small bowel is diffusely dilated with some of the
small bowel loops measuring up to 3.5 cm. There is no point of
transition noted. The colon is also air filled.

No significant retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. No significant
intraperitoneal fluid.

CT OF PELVIS FINDINGS: Some free fluid is seen in the pelvis.
The bladder is normal.

Bony windows show no definite fractures.

Multiplanar reconstructions were essential in depicting the
anatomy and identifying the pathology.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of any solid organ injury in a patient status
post stab injury to left upper quadrant with status post repair
of left diaphragmatic rupture.
2. Fluid collection located just superior to the pancreas; it is
an difficult site of access for percutaneous drainage. If
clinically indicated consideration to endoscopic transgastric
drainage should be made.
3. Small bowel dilation consistent with ileus.
4. Free intraperitoneal air status post surgery.
5. Free fluid in the pelvis.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP); -77 BY DIFFERENT PHYSICIAN

Reason: please evaluate for cardiopulm process

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
16 year old man with SW to chest, s/p ex lap & diaphragmatic
repair, now requring non-rebreather
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please evaluate for cardiopulm process
HISTORY: Status post stab wound to chest with diaphragmatic
rupture repair requiring increased O2 requirements.

Comparison is made to [**7-26**] and [**7-27**] examinations.

UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH

Left lower lobe atelectasis with elevation of left hemidiaphragm
and adjacent effusion may be minimally improved since most
recent radiograph with no new consolidations identified. Right
costophrenic angle is not included on current film. There is
unchanged gaseous prominence of the bowel which may suggest
postoperative ileus.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma Service and taken directly to the
operating room form the Emergency room for an exploratory lap,
repair of diaphragm and left chest thoracostomy. There were no
intraoperative complications. Postoperatively he did have pain
control issues; he was initially on PCA Dilaudid and was later
transitioned to oral narcotics. he did not have relief with the
oral medications and required intermittent IV Dilaudid for
breakthrough pain. He was very slow to mobilize postoperatively,
often refusing to get out of bed and using the incentive
spirometer. Despite continuous encouragement and reinforcement
on the importance of getting out of bed he remained reluctant to
do so.

There was a trigger event called several days prior to his
discharge where he desaturated in the high 80's; chest xray
revealed atelectasis and an effusion. He was treated for a
pneumonia and initially required supplemental oxygen. He was
eventually weaned from the oxygen and became more compliant with
getting out of bed and using the incentive spirometer.

His left chest thoracostomy was removed without any
complications; his abdominal wound staples were intact and will
be removed next week when he returns to clinic. Despite a fair
appetite he was tolerating a regular diet; no bowel movement at
time of this dictation but abdominal exam was benign. He was
agreeable to oral laxatives but adamantly refused rectal
laxatives on multiple occasions. He and his parents were given
explicit instruction on a bowel regimen and were told to call
the trauma clinic if no bowel movement in the next 1-2 days.

He was evaluated by Physical therapy and deemed safe for
discharge to home. He is being discharged to home with skilled
nursing services.
