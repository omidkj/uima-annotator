Pertinent Results:
CT torso with contrast [**2191-5-18**]:

IMPRESSION:
1. Findings consistent with a type B intramural hematoma of the
intrathoracic aorta. This process does not involve the
intra-abdominal aorta.

2. Extensive atherosclerotic disease of the intrathoracic and
intra-abdominal aorta, with a focal area of mural thrombus
within the mid abdominal aorta, which extends into the proximal
portion of an aneurysmal left renal artery, as detailed above.
The more distal left renal artery is widely patent. There is
also aneurysmal dilatation of the aortic arch.

3. Heterogeneously enhancing 4.6 x 3.5 cm right renal mass,
concerning for a primary renal neoplasm.

4. 7 x 5 mm noncalcified nodule within the left upper lobe.
While this may
represent a benign entity such as a noncalcified granuloma,
close follow-up is warranted given the above findings within the
right kidney.

5. Partially calcified nodules within the right lobe of the
thyroid gland.
Clinical correlation is recommended.

6. Cholelithiasis.

Urine cytology showed atypical uroepithelial cells.  Patient and
family aware.  Will discuss further with urologist.
