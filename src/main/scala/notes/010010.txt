CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Cardiac arrest.

MAJOR SURGICAL-INVASIVE PROCEDURES:  None.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 63070**] is an 80-year-old
male with a history of COPD and BPH who was found
down/unresponsive at home and brought to [**Hospital 4199**] Hospital and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care. Apparently, his
girlfriend found him on his back in his kitchen. She had not
seen him since the day before. She called EMS, and the
patient was brought to an outside hospital. At the outside
hospital the patient was found to have a temperature of
107.1, heart rate 140, blood pressure of 67/30, and
respiratory rates of 20. Head CT was negative. He was given
dantrolene 100 mg IV for concern for malignant hypothermia
and given 30 liters of nasal saline, and ceftriaxone, and
Tequin. ABG showed 7.38/21/46. The patient was intubated
without sedation. Blood cultures were drawn. UA was sent.
Ativan was given for agitation. BP increased to a maximum of
120/60, but was subsequently down to 90/40. The patient was
then started on dopamine as a pressor and transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**]. Prior to transfer the patient was noted to be in SVT.
He was given 6 mg and then 2 mg of adenosine. Blood glucose
at outside hospital was 164. Pupils noted to be fixed and
dilated prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. Per EMT transport, the
patient dropped systolic blood pressure. In transit, dopamine
was up titrated and Levophed was added. Of note, there was no
central access on the patient; and Levophed and dopamine were
started via a peripheral IV. Also, the patient was sedated
for over breathing the vent prior to admission to [**Hospital1 18**]; and
his pCO2 was 20, and bicarbonate was 9.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  As above. Revealed pupils dilated,
unresponsive to light, bloody oral mucosa, positive dolls
eyes, dusky lips and nails. Diffuse ecchymosis along the
skin. Some abdominal scars. VITAL SIGNS: Heart rate was 73,
respirations 20, blood pressure 90/58. The patient was on the
vent when admitted with AC of 450 x 12.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  CK was 734, MB was 17.4,
troponin was 6.57, white count was 16.2, hematocrit was 40.2,
INR was 1.4, cholesterol was 207, LDH was 785, AST was 588,
ALT was 387. His ventilator settings were AC 500 x 22, 1.0,
PEEP of 0, the blood gas on that was 7.22/35/491.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  At 1:51 p.m. at outside hospital the EKG
showed sinus tachycardia at 133, developing downsloping ST
depressions in V3 to V6, ST elevations in leads V1 through
V2.

At 6:37 p.m. at the outside hospital the EKG resolved sinus
rhythm at 90; primary third-degree AV block; right bundle
branch block; ST depressions in V4 through V6; and T wave
inversions in II, III and aVF.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  An 80-year-old male with a history of
COPD and BPH was found unresponsive down from unclear
etiology with tachycardia and EKG changes at the outside
hospital and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. On arrival, repeat
labs showed shocked liver (ALT was 1584, AST was 2328, total
bilirubin was 1.9), renal failure with a creatinine of 3.2,
with CK elevation to 4091, and likely DIC with elevated
anticoagulation profile and low platelets.

On admission, overall picture was extremely grim and
concerning for anoxic brain injury with neuro exam
significant for dolls eyes and sluggish minimally reactive
dilated pupils. There was also evidence of multiorgan system
failure with increased LFTs and possible DIC.

On admission, the family did not feel that the patient would
want any aggressive measures. His healthcare proxy - the
patient's daughter ([**Name (NI) 2808**]) and son [**Doctor First Name **] - did not want
central venous lines, chest x-ray or other diagnostic or
therapeutic procedures and made the patient CMO. This was
communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and to the cardiology fellow on
call. The cardiology fellow on call agreed with present
management, and the patient was placed on a morphine and
expired shortly thereafter.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Expired.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Expired.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Acute myocardial infarction.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  None.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  None.
