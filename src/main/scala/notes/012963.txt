HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to
Neurosurgery on [**2192-6-11**], for a cerebrospinal fluid leak
from her Ommaya reservoir site and then transferred to O-Med
on [**6-25**] after the leak had resolved, for further care for
a methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus urinary tract
infection, hyponatremia secondary to serum-inappropriate
antidiuretic hormone, and neutropenia.  Briefly, her course
during her Neurosurgery admission, according to the transfer
note and discussion with her attending, was as follows:

Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 62-year-old right-handed Indian woman with
metastatic breast cancer to the brain (parenchyma and
leptomeningeal).  She was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 1444**] to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **]
Hospital on [**2192-5-25**], after undergoing placement of an
Ommaya reservoir for intrathecal chemotherapy (left frontal
ventricular access).  She returned to [**Hospital1 190**] on [**6-11**] with a cerebrospinal fluid leak
from the site, and had a stitched placed, with no further
leakage until [**6-22**], after receiving her most recent IT
thiotepa (second dose).  This has not leaked since, but she
does have a lodged area under her scalp which is most likely
cerebrospinal fluid, which required no further treatment at
that time.  She developed a methicillin resistant
staphylococcus aureus urinary tract infection and a full
workup for this also revealed positive methicillin resistant
staphylococcus aureus in her right eye.  She began
intravenous vancomycin on [**6-21**].  Other active issues at
the time of transfer included a clogged gastrojejunostomy
tube which was unclogged in Interventional Radiology on [**6-25**].  Her mental status at the time of transfer was that she
would open her eyes and speak incoherently to her children,
not following commands.  She has been on bed rest, and not
able to actively participate in physical therapy or
occupational therapy.

Upon transfer to O-Med on [**6-25**], her history is as follows:
Her history is now most significant for neutropenia (white
blood cells of 0.4 with an absolute neutrophil count of 320),
methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus urinary tract
infection on intravenous vancomycin, and hyponatremia
secondary to serum-inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.  Her
sodium had decreased to 125 on [**6-21**] to 21, but it slowly
trended upward with fluid restriction and sodium tablets to
133 on the day of transfer.  The patient is unable to give a
history secondary to her mental status changes and language
barrier.  Her children speak English, and provided her
history.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Breast cancer, metastatic to brain and leptomeninges;
diagnosed in [**2192-2-3**] when she presented with arm
cellulitis that did not respond to intravenous antibiotics.
An excisional biopsy was performed that revealed a 3 cm
lesion consistent with both ductal and lobular cancer on
pathology.  A wide resection revealed axillary lymph nodes on
[**2192-4-7**], with 7/7 positive axillary lymph nodes.
Pathology was consistent with a Grade II lobular carcinoma in
situ.  In [**2192-5-2**], Mrs. [**Known lastname **] presented with frontal
headaches, nausea and vomiting.  An MRI showed metastases to
the brain (the right posterior temporal lobe and right
cerebellum and leptomeninges).  She began treatment with
Decadron and whole body radiation for ten days.  An Ommaya
reservoir was placed on [**2192-5-21**].  In this month, she
also was diagnosed with serum-inappropriate antidiuretic
hormone associated with mental status changes.  A lumbar
puncture was done which showed equal opening pressures at the
ventricle.  A head CT on [**5-22**] performed because the patient
was somnolent as well as to assess changes in the patient's
condition for possible chemotherapy, showed progression of
hydrocephalus, but the fourth ventricle was not blocked and
with equal opening pressures.  They then began chemotherapy
(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2192-5-22**].  She was started on
adriamycin weekly and intrathecal thiotepa.  A
gastrojejunostomy tube was also placed, and she received her
second dose of intrathecal thiotepa on [**6-25**].
2.  Hypertension
3.  Serum-inappropriate antidiuretic hormone
4.  Status post a motor vehicle accident in [**2181**] where she
lost her left thumb, suffered a right eye corneal abrasion
resulting in right eye blindness.  She also lost her husband
in this accident.
5.  Gastrojejunostomy tube placement on [**5-21**] or 21 for
inability to take food by mouth
6.  Atypical chest pain with two cardiac admissions since
[**2192-2-3**] that have had negative workups

ALLERGIES:   Augmentin was documented previously, but son
denies this is a true allergy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] came to the United States from
[**Country 11150**] in [**2188**].  She lives with her son in [**Name (NI) 5110**].  She
previously was a bicyclist and a  physical education teacher.
There is no smoking or alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Her brother died of cirrhosis not associated
with alcohol use, and there is no history of cancer in the
family.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO THE O-MED SERVICE:
1.  Ciprofloxacin 500 mg by mouth every 12 hours
2.  Metronidazole 500 mg three times a day by mouth
3.  Vancomycin 1 gram intravenously every 12 hours
4.  Sodium chloride 1 gram four times a day by mouth
5.  Zofran 2 mg twice a day intravenously as needed for
nausea
6.  Mupirocin cream 2% twice a day to the gastrojejunostomy
tube site
7.  Lansoprazole oral suspension 30 once daily
8.  Regular insulin sliding scale
9.  Hydrocodone/acetaminophen one tablet every four to six
hours as needed for pain by mouth
10. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twice a day
11. Lasix elixir 40 twice a day by mouth
12. Ofloxacin ointment to the left eye
13. Bacitracin/polymixin ointment to the right eye

LABORATORY DATA:  On transfer to O-Med, white blood cells
0.4, hemoglobin 10.1, hematocrit 30.1, platelets 356.  Sodium
133, potassium 4.9, chloride 96, bicarbonate 25, BUN 25,
creatinine 0.3, glucose 121.  Urinalysis on [**6-21**] was
yellow and hazy with a specific gravity of 1.01 and a pH of
7.5.  It was positive for nitrite, small leukocyte esterase,
[**6-11**] white blood cells, [**11-21**] red blood cells.  Micro on [**6-18**] blood cultures (two sets) had no growth.  [**6-21**] blood
cultures (two sets) also had no growth.  [**6-21**] urine
culture showed methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus
greater than 100,000, gram-positive bacteria greater than
100,000, alpha hemolytic, consistent with strep or
lactobacillus species.  [**6-24**] throat culture was negative
for strep, and gynecologic culture was negative for N.
gonorrhoeae.

STUDIES:
1.  CT head without contrast performed on [**2192-6-10**]:
a.  Interval development of 5 mm wide water density subdural
collection in the left frontoparietal region with associated
effacement of the sulci without shift of midline structures.
This lesion is most commonly an effect of hemorrhage, in
which case the low density suggests chronicity; however, a
relation to the drainage catheter needs to be explored;
Neurosurgical consultation is advised.
b.  Moderately prominent panventricular dilation not
significantly changed compared to the prior examination.  The
pattern is consistent with communicating hydrocephalus.

2.  Chest x-ray performed on [**2192-6-12**]:  No evidence of
congestive heart failure, pneumonia, or pleural effusion.

3.  Ultrasound Doppler of the upper extremities performed
because of an arm swelling with a right-sided PICC line
showed no evidence of a deep venous thrombosis.

4.  CT angio performed on [**2192-6-12**]:
a.  Bibasilar atelectasis
b.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism

5.  MRI of the head performed on [**2192-6-13**] showed:
a.  Left-sided ventricular shunt in position with partial
decompression of the left lateral ventricle
b.  New left-sided subdural fluid collection which was not
present
