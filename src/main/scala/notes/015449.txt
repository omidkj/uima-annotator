History of Present Illness:
74 year old female who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] with a dry
cough for the last month. She tried different cough medications
with no relief. She has been feeling progressively weak and
tired despite minimal activity. She also
has been feeling nauseated lately. She was found to be
tachycardic up to 120 in the ED. She also became short of breath
and chest xray showed worsening CHF and was treated with Lasix
with good effect. She was also found to have new anemia but
guaiac negative. Upper endoscopy revealed stomach ulcer.  She
was started on PPI, transfused and reports relief of GI
symptoms. Echo revealed critical aortic stenosis.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation on aortic stenosis.

Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  40% to 50%  >= 55%
Aorta - Sinus Level:  *3.7 cm  <= 3.6 cm
Aorta - Ascending:  3.3 cm  <= 3.4 cm

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement. No mass/thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]
LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity. No thrombus in the
LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD
by 2D or color Doppler.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple
atheroma in aortic arch. Normal descending aorta diameter.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was passed with assistance from the anesthesioology
staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related complications.
patient.
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No mass/thrombus
is seen in the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No thrombus
is seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is critical aortic
valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation
is seen.
7. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. There is severe mitral annular
calcification. There is a minimally increased gradient
consistent with trivial mitral stenosis. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
8. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.
POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. AV pacing for slow sinus
and transient first degree block. Well-seated bioprosthetic
valve in the aortic position. No AI. Gradient is now 15 mmHg.
Biventricular systolic function is now improved post- CPB. LVEF
= 60%. Trace MR. Aortic contour is normal post decannulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 24876**] was transferred from [**Hospital1 18**]-[**Location (un) 620**] to determine if she
was a surgical candidate after echocardiogram revealed severe
aortic stenosis.
She underwent the usual cardiac surgery workup including dental
exam, carotid US and cardiac catheterization. She needed
extractions and was seen by oral surgery and had extractions of:
teeth #3 and #28 on [**2-13**].
She was then brought to the operating [**2121-2-18**] for aortic
valve replacement and coronary bypass grafting, please see
operative report for details. In Summary she had:
1. Urgent aortic valve replacement
