consciousness for several secondas and then woke up again,
unable tp express himself, goaning only. 911 was called.
The pt was brought to [**Hospital3 **]. There on EKG he was found
to have ST elevations in II,III and aVF, as well as V3,v4, v5.
He was also in complete heart [**Doctor Last Name **],. Atropine was given.
Dopamine was started for hypotension. Heparin was started. he
was tranferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for urgent intervention.
.
At [**Hospital1 18**] the patient arrived hypotensive with systolic BP 59, HR
50. He went into asystole and was given stropine. A temporary
pacer wire was placed. Cardiac Catherization revealed a
completely accluded RCA and high grade stenosis of the LCX. The
pt had a BM stent placed to the RCA and amgioplasty of the Lt
Cx. A right heart cath showed PA pressure of 40/24, AO pressure
of 72/45. An IABP was placed., Dopamine was continued. Several
doses of Atrpine were given throughout the procedure. During the
prcedure the pt experienced vagal symptoms including pause of a
few seconds duration as well as nausea and vomiting. He had a
documented aspiratione vent and was intubated for airway
protection. The patietn then developed hypotension and was
started on neosynepherine and phenylepherine for pressure
support.  A total of 6L NS was given. The pt was Plavix loaded
with 600mg. An ECHO did not reveal ventricular wall rupture,
acute valvular dysfunction or tamponade. The LV appeared largely
normal. 3 amps of NaHCO3 was given for acidemia.
.
On review of symptoms the family denies hx of stroke, DVT, PE,
bleeding at tiem of surgery, black or red stools.
.
Cardiac review of symptoms is notable for absence of chest pain,
PND, PA ,orthopnea, palpatations.
.
Pn arrival to the CCU, te pt was hypotensive. Intial ABG
revealed pH of 7.09. 3 amps of bicarb given. Neosynepherine,
dopamine and phynepherine were titrated to max doses. Pacing
rate increased to 86. MAP imorved to 60's./ Family was informed
of grave prognosis

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac cath [**2162-9-13**]

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Profound systemic arterial hypotension.
3. Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by acute PCI,
IABP, and
temporary pacemaker.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of 100% proximal RCA lesion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Inferior MI:
PAtient was transferred from OSH for cardiac catheterization.
the RCA was stented, and following this, he had became
bradycardic, nauseous and vomited, with witness aspirtation. He
was unresponsive, and there was a code blue. He was given
atropine, and asytole resolved. He received a temporary pacer.
He was persistently hypotensive despite fuid hydration and was
put on levophed, dopamine and neosynepherine. He was transferred
to he ICU in critical condition. Repeat ABGs revieled pH below
7.2, and was given several amps of bicarb. The family was
informed of the grave prognosis, and they made the decision to
withdraw care. The pressors were discontinued, and the patient
was declared dead on [**2162-9-14**].
