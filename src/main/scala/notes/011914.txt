rash

History of Present Illness:
Hx obtained from OMR records and staff as patient is somnolent
and encephalopathic, presumably from a 10 minute episode of a
generalized tonic clonic seizure.  Attempted to contact family
(son) and home number w/o ability to reach anyone.
.
47 year old woman with w/spina bifida, MR, paraperesis, recent
TEN ([**3-4**] Bactrim, ~ 20-30% of BSA) and seizure disorder
(non-epileptic and/or epileptic) who initially presented to the
ED with RLE pain and swelling.  Reportedly she first noted the
pain and swelling when she awoke on day of admission [**2177-8-13**].
Apparently the pain was greatest in ankle and calf, was
described as sharp, up to [**10-10**], and worse with weight bearing.
No recent trauma, fevers, chills or night sweats. ROS otherwise
negative.  It is unknown if she had taken any new or
non-prescribed medications.
.
In ED initial VS were 98 87 128/70 18 98. LENI was negative.
XRays showed DJD and soft tissue swelling but no fracture. ED
and later orthopedics both tried to tap her ankle but were
unable to obtain any fluid. Significant pain was encountered on
attempt to aspirate R ankle joint.  She was started on
vancomycin for suspected cellulitis and sent to floor.
.
On the floor, she was normotensive and not tachycardic
overnight. At 1400 was note dto have a "seizure" by RN, lasting
10 minutes, which resolved after administration of 4mg IV
ativan.  Later in afternoon, developed a fever to 102.3F, HR to
120s, SBP to 90s and confused. Lost IV access.  It was noted
that erythema on her leg had progressed to her hip, became
indurated.  There was concern for nec. fasc. thus surgery and
MICU were consulted.
.
Review of systems:   Unable to obtain.

Physical Exam:
Gen: ill-appearing lady on supplemental O2, not oriented, groans
to
pain
Vitals: 102.3F 115/58 99 14 99% on vent
General: Somnolent, responds to vocal stimuli.
HEENT: normal skin, no meningismus, obese.
Neck: flat JVD no LAD
Lungs: CTA bilaterally
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, tachycardic, normal S1 + S2
Abdomen: soft, TTP on RLQ, erythematous, indurated skin surface.
 No desquamation.  normal BS.  Urostomy in place, clear urine.
Ext: Bilateral erythema in LEs, R >> L, TTP and indurated, with
erythema spreading to RLQ and flank.  She is very TTP and
winces/screams.  There is mild edema in R ankle.  There are no
mucosal ulcers or loss of epithelium orally or vaginally.

Exam per dermatology resident at 2 am:

ill-appearing lady on supplemental O2, not oriented, groans to
pain
Skin Type V
A complete cutaneous examination of the scalp, face, neck,
eyelids, mouth, conjunctiva, chest, abdomen, back, bilateral
arms, bilateral legs, buttocks, digits and nails reveals the
following significant findings:
-RLE edema w/ overlying deep erythema which extends up RLE and
is
more pronounced on R lateral thigh/buttock
-similar erythematous rash extends up R lateral trunk, axilla
and
skin folds of neck--> becomes papillomatous-like plaques from
excessive soft tissue and skin swelling, there is more
violaceous
skin changes along R axilla; pt groans to pain when lesions
pressed firmly
-L antecubital fossa w/ violaceous patch w/ appears c/w
impending
necrosis
-sclera icteric
-no palmar/plantar involvement
-there are no bullae or vesicles, no desquamtion
-lips and genitals wnls

Repeat dermatological exam:

Pt re-examined 2 hours later.  Rash now appears more
violaceous/dusky on b/l axilla and forearms and more concerning
for an early evolving TEN-picutre.  There is a + Nikolsky sign
which was absent earlier.  In addition, she has what appears to
be impending desquamation on trunk and b/l axilla and forearms.
Still w/ no mucosal lesions.  While no clear inciting [**Doctor Last Name 360**] for
TEN, pt does have [**Last Name (un) **] to PCN and meropenem can have some cross
reactivity.  We will bx and send specimens for tissue cx and
path.  Attempts to call pt's son for consent went unanswered.
Will proceed w/ bx at this time given that pt acutely ill and
information gleaned from bx critical to her management.  2 3mm
punch bxs obtained from R abd.  + lido/epi, 4.0 Ethilon,
vaseline, bandaid placed.  No complications.

Imaging:

CT torso [**8-14**]:

1. No evidence of subcutaneous air to suggest nec fasc. please
note that
subcutaneous fat of lateral aspects of the buttocks bilaterally
are excluded
from view.
2. edema of the soft tissues, predominantly of the lower
extremities.
bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy
3. Pelvic lymphadenopathy, most prominent along the right
external iliac chain
measuring up to 1.1 cm in short axis diameter.
4. bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy, right > left, measuring
up to 1.4 cm
short axis diameter, increased from [**2176-11-8**].
5. status post urostomy with an ileal conduit seen exiting the
right lower
pelvis anteriorly, unchanged.
6. congenital spinal dysraphism in the lower lumbar and upper
sacral regions,
unchanged, with meningocele.
7. stable right upper lobe pulmonary nodule.

XRay ankle, right [**8-14**]:
No definite fracture or dislocation. Demineralization with
degenerative disease. Marked soft tissue swelling. If symptoms
persist,
recommend followup radiographs in 10 days.

LENI [**8-13**]:

IMPRESSION: No definite evidence of DVT in the right lower
extremity.

CXR [**8-13**]:

AP AND LATERAL VIEW, CHEST: The study is limited due to
underpenetration.
Within these limitations, there is no focal consolidation,
pleural effusion,
pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. Heart size is upper limit of
normal and
hilar contours are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
