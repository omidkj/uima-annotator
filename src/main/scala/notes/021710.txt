Chief Complaint:
Mental status changes and weakness.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 57 year old woman with metastatic small cell lung
carcinoma to the brain and spine diagnosed in [**2146-2-6**] who
presents with progessive mental status changes and weakness over
the past several days.  On the day of admission, patient's
husband brought her to MRI and then immediately to ED for
evaluation.  Over the past several days, he endorsed that the
patient had been more lethargic and had increased difficulty
ambulating with her walker.  Before the onset of symptoms, she
had been able to walk all around the [**Location (un) 448**] of their house,
but was now limited to two steps.  She had increased shortness
of breath and bilateral lower extremity swelling over the last
three days, but denied any recent cough, fever, emesis.  She
suffers continual pain in her back and a band-like pain across
the lower aspect of her ribs/upper abdomen.  For this, she has
required increased doses of sustained oxycodone.  She did
endorse mild nausea on the morning of admission and her appetite
had decreased recently.  On review, she denied any stool or
bladder incontinence or falls.
In the ED, she was afebrile at 95.0, HR 131, BP 101/53, RR 20,
and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air.  She received one
liter of normal saline and was started on vancomycin and
cefepime.  She also received 10mg of PO oxycodone.

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
-MRI Head with and without contrast ([**2147-7-22**]):  Since the
previous MRI of [**2147-5-18**], there has been considerable decrease in
size and resolution of several of the previously noted lesions.
No new enhancing lesions to indicate new metastatic foci are
noted.  There has been decrease in edema seen on FLAIR and
T2-weighted images since the previous study.  No mass effect or
hydrocephalus seen.
.
-Chest Xray ([**2147-7-22**]):  1.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
2.  Unchanged small left pleural effusion or scarring.  Mild
left basilar atelectasis.
.
-CT chest/abd/pelvis ([**2147-7-22**]):  1.  This study cannot rule out
pulmonary embolism given lack of IV contrast.  2.  Density
within the right anterior upper lobe which follows a
peribronchovascular pattern which is worrisome for metastatic
spread of disease.  3.  Small left pleural effusion. 4.
Unchanged appearance of infrarenal IVC filter.
5.  Diffuse permeative metastatic disease to the osseous
structures.
.
-EKG ([**2147-7-22**]):  Sinus tachycardia at 123.  Normal intervals.
Mild ST wave flattening.
.
.
MICRO:
-Blood culture ([**2147-7-22**]):  Negative to date.
.
-Urine culture ([**2147-7-22**]):  Negative to date.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course/Assessment/Plan:
57 year old woman with metastatic small cell lung cancer to
brain and spine who presents with several days of worsening
mental status and weakness.
Expired at 7:45PM on evening of [**2147-7-25**].  [**Name (NI) **]
husband was present.
.
.
1) Pain:
Most likely related to metastatic spread from small cell lung
cancer.  Palliative care team had extensive family meeting.
Before patient expired, determined that patient would be
transferred home with hospice and plan to continue fentanyl and
lidocaine patch, concentrated morphine, ativan, lorazepam, and
oral steroids.
.
2) Acute renal failure:
Baseline creatinine 0.5, but on admission elevated to 1.8 and
increased to 2.6 during admission.  FeNa 0.1%, but urine output
did not respond to fluid challenges.  In setting of anasarca and
liver dysfunction, most likely decreased renal perfusion.
.
3) Elevated White count:
White count 14.9 and lactate 4.1 on admission.  Indicative of
infection, with concern on CT chest for left lower lobe
pneumonia.  Urine and blood cultures negative during admission.
Declined placement of central venous line.
-Started on vancomycin and cefepime in ED, but discontinued
broad spectrum antibiotics as afebrile.  Switched to seven day
course of levofloxacin.  White count remained slightly elevated,
but results difficult to interpret given oral steroids for pain
relief.
.
4) Shortness of breath:
Patient with history of PE and DVTs while on coumadin.  IVC
filter in place, so unlikely to be pulmonary embolus, although
tachycardic with [**Known lastname **] oxygen saturations.  No IVC thrombus
detected on CT abdomen and pelvis.  IVC filter placed on [**5-19**], as coumadin was stopped as concern for intracranial bleed in
setting of metastases.
-Cardiac enzymes negative.  No evidence of pericardial effusion
on chest CT.
.
5) Weakness:
Increased weakness on days prior to admission.  Most likely due
to decreased PO intake.  Hydrated with IV fluids and given
thiamine.  Calcium and cortisol levels normal.
.
6) Oncology:
-Followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name
