per day, which she describes as red liquid and clots. No fever,
chills, nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain. She initially came
to the ED over the weekend and was admitted for monitoring and
possibly colonoscopy, but left AMA after being told that she
could not leave the hospital to smoke a cigarette. According to
the patient, she went home last night, ate fish filet, Ziti and
milk, and then had a BM that consisted of blood mixed with stool
this AM. She spoke to her PCP today and was advised to return to
the ED for further workup.

triggered for hypotension on arrival, received 1.5 L IVF and BP

stool. Labs were significant for a leukocytosis to 14 (down from
17.5 yesterday) with a mild neutrophilia and a Hct of 40.2
(stable >24hrs). U/A and CXR were unremarkable and the patient
was admitted to the medical service for further monitoring.

18, BP 91/54 and 96% RA.
.

Imaging:

CXR: IMPRESSION:
5-mm right granuloma. Dense opacity projecting over the left
heart may
reflect costochondral calcifications, however a parenchymal
opacity is
possible and a PA and lateral chest radiograph is recommended to
further
assess initially.

CXR: FINDINGS: A single upright AP view of the chest was
obtained. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stably enlarged. A streaky
retrocardiac
opacity likely in the left lower lobe is new compared to the
prior study
possibly representing a developing pneumonia. A calcified
granuloma is again noted inferior to the right minor fissure.
Calcification projecting over the lower left heart border likely
represents mitral annular calcifications.
There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. No osseous
abnormalities are identified.

Colonoscopy Findings:
Protruding Lesions: Non-bleeding grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
were noted.
Excavated LesionsL: End to side small bowel to colon anastomosis
at about 20 cm from anal verge. At the anastomosis there was a
large area of ulceration with stigmata of recent bleeding (red
spots). No active bleeding. No intervention performed. No
biopsies secondary to anticoagulation and bleeding.

Impression: Ulcer in the colon
Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to 30 cm
Recommendations: End to side small bowel to colon anastomosis at
20 cm from anal verge with ulceration with stigmata of recent
bleeding (red spots) at site. Recommend repeat colonoscopy with
biopsies in 2 weeks. If continued bleeding recommend surgical
evaluation as likely result of ischemia at site of anastomosis.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 59 yo F with A fib on dabigutran, COPD, hx of
colectomy and bipolar d/o who presented with several weeks of
BRBPR which is attributed to an ulcer at the site of a previous
colonic anastamosis.
.
# LGIB: The patient was immediately transferred to the MICU upon
admission for brisk LGIB and tachycardia. She was intubated for
a colonoscopy which revealed a ulcer at the site of her
anastamoses from a previous colonic anastamosis ([**Hospital1 2025**] records
obtained, and colectomy was apparently performed for severe
constipation). She received 2 units PRBCs and HCT remain
