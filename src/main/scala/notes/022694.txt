Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Allopurinol And Derivatives / Levofloxacin

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 3290**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
HD

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yoM with CHF (EF 40-45%), diastolic dysfunction, atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin, s/p [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular ICD, Asthma, ESRD
on HD since [**5-/2140**], presenting for shortness of breath, admitted
to the MICU for respiratory distress.
.
The patient's symptoms initially began in [**2140-5-18**] when he
developed was initiated on hemodialysis for progressive CKD for
over 10 years. At this time, he underwent HD and reportedly
became hypotensive with SBP 70's and had a cardiac arrest. He
was resuscitated and intubated, and subsequently developed MRSA
PNA. Following resolution of his PNA, the patient reports
persistent cough productive of white sputum that had
intermittently become yellow-brown at times. His son reports
that since [**Name (NI) **], he has had minimal to no fluid removed at
hemodialysis despite progressively increasing lower extremity
edema, out of concern for hypotension given his prior arrest.
Over the holidays, he had increased salt intake and increased
fluid intake with worsening of his progressive bilateral lower
extremity edema. He recently began experiencing orthopnea and
for the past 1-2 days, may have had PND. He had has an increased
nebulizer requirement and also has been sleeping sitting up in a
rocking chair with a pillow.
.
Additionally, the patient's son had been sick with the flu 2
weeks ago and the patient's second son had developed an upper
respiratory infection recently. He reportedly began experiencing
cough, congestion for several days and began experiencing mild
shortness of breath yesterday. He continued to have shortness of
breath and chest tightness today following hemodialysis, which
is not unusual for the patient, and was driven to the ED by his
son. Although the patient denies fevers at home, he was found to
be febrile to 102.5 today. He thinks he may have had a change in
sputum color from thick white to thick yellow in the past [**1-20**]
days. He also reports some chest congestion, increased fatigue
and lethargy, and minimal rhinorrhea in the past three days but
denies sore throat, myalgias, arthralgias, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria. He denies chest pain.
.
Of note, the patient had been admitted for MRSA pneumonia in
[**2140-5-18**].
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 102.5 106 158/133 20 92% RA
The patient was noted to be pale and was reported to look unwell
in triage. PO2 92% RA in triage but improved subsequently
without intervention. However, the patient had marked tachypnea
and increased work of breathing, and was placed on bipap with
subsequent improvement. He was found to have T 102.5 with
non-productive cough, and CXR showed no significant infiltrates
but could not rule out possible LLL infiltrate? Blood cultures
were sent and the patient was given duo-nebs, Vancomycin and
Azithromycin as well as Tylenol 1 gm po. BNP was [**Numeric Identifier 111261**], lactate
was 2.8. Transfer vitals were: 81 109/51 25 100% on bipap.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was off bipap on high flow
oxygen by nasal cannula, which was rapidly weaned down to 4L NC.
He continued to have a cough productive of yellow sputum.
.

Imaging:
CXR: : Single AP upright portable view of the chest was
obtained. Left
sided triple-lead AICD is unchanged in position. The lung
volumes are
slightly decreased. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
stable.
Bibasilar opacities likely representing chronic
atelectasis/scarring are
stable. The right costophrenic angle is not fully included on
the image and a small right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
There is trace blunting of the left costophrenic angle and a
trace left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. No overt
pulmonary edema is seen.

EKG:
Demand ventricular pacing. No change compared to tracing #1


Brief Hospital Course:
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE
[**Age over 90 **]yoM with CHF (EF 40-45%), diastolic dysfunction, atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin, Asthma, ESRD on HD since [**5-/2140**], s/p
[**Hospital1 **]-ventricular ICD, presented with shortness of breath, hypoxia
and productive cough. He was briefly in the ICU and treated for
decompensated diastolic heart failure, pneumonia and an asthma
flare in addition to cellulitis. He was discharged on a
prolongued prednisone taper and new oxygen.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
1. Dyspnea: Multifactorial.  Etiology of dyspnea likely
multifactorial including URI, asthma flare and decompensated
heart failure. HD/ultrafiltration in outpatient setting limited
by prior peri-HD hypotension complicated by cardiac arrest.  He
was initially admitted to the ICU for management. Chest xray
significant for LLL opacity. He was completed an 8 day course of
vancomycin and cefepime for health care associated pneumonia
(HD).  Given significant wheeze on exam he was given 125mg IV
methylprednisone before transitioning to 40mg po prednisone on
the floor with standing xopenex and ipratropium nebs.  His
oxygen requirement was weaned from 4 liters to 2 liters.  He was
given chest physical therapy and guaifenacin for mucus
production. He was discharged on a slow prednisone taper with 2
liters of oxygen with saturations in the high 90s. Significant
fluid was taken off with HD, with discharge weight ap
