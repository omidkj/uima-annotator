Chief Complaint:
Back pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar Embolization

History of Present Illness:
60 female admitted after imaging at OSH revealing an L1
compression fracture and a renal mass extending into the L renal
vein to the IVC and into the right atrium. Evalutated by both
neurosurgery and oncology for treatment plans. The patient
reports that in [**8-/2183**] she twisted her back, causing intractable
pain, that prompted imaging that revealed the aforementioned
abnormaliities. She reports dyspnea, back pain, leg weakness
with exertion, leg swelling, transient hematuria, &
constipation.. She denies any HA, CP, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
melena, hematochezia. She also reports that her exercise
tolerance has decreased on account of her leg pain. She says
that she is not limited by her back pain of dyspnea, but that
her legs "give out".

Imaging:
MR L SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-10-28**] 9:43 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Very limited study due to motion artifact. A complete
diagnostic examination was not performed.
2. Collapse of the L1 vertebral body with retropulsion of bony
fragments into the canal, with probable severe cord compression.
3. Left-sided paraspinal mass, and mass in the left renal fossa.
These findings are not well evaluated here.
.
CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-10-29**] 12:57 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Hyperdense focus in the left basal ganglia, with enhancement.
Lack of mass effect and edema is more suggestive of a cavernoma
than a metastasis, but an MRI is recommended in order to
evaluate further and to better characterize the lesion.
Alternatively, if prior outside imaging can be obtained to show
long-term stability, demonstration of benignity could be
achieved without further imaging.
2. Surgical clip along the posterior aspect of the left
maxillary sinus, possibly due to prior surgical treatment for
hemorrhage. Correlation with surgical history is recommended.
.
ECHO Study Date of [**2183-10-30**]
Conclusions:
1. A large (4x6.5 cm), mobile mass with a large cyst is seen in
the right
atrium, probably starting in the IVC, filling almost all of the
right atrrium,  prolapsing through the tricuspid valve, and into
the right ventricle.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity  size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional
left ventricular wall motion  is normal.
3. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-10-31**] 3:21 PM
IMPRESSION: Small focus of chronic blood products and
enhancement in the left subinsular region adjacent to the
anterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle as described above.
The differential diagnosis is between cavernous angioma and a
metastatic disease given the patient's clinical history of a
renal cell cancer. The MRI appearances and the presence of
developmental venous anomaly in the adjacent brain favor
cavernous malformation as suggested on the previous CT. However,
if further assessment is clinically indicated, the perfusion MRI
with arterial spin labeling may help for differentiation
MRA OF THE HEAD:
The head MRA is limited by motion. No evidence of vascular
occlusion or high-grade stenosis is seen in the arteries of
anterior and posterior circulation.
IMPRESSION: Motion limited head MRA demonstrates no evidence of
vascular occlusion.
.
CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST  [**2183-10-31**] 10:38 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Very large left renal mass with multiple associated bulky
retroperitoneal, adrenal, and left paraspinal metastases. This
is again most consistent with renal cell carcinoma.
2. Destruction of the L1 vertebral body with associated epidural
disease compressing the spinal canal superiorly at this level.
3. Extensive tumor thrombus within the inferior vena cava
extending into the right atrium and crossing the tricuspid
valve.
4. Evidence of pulmonary metastases with largest mass
demonstrated in the right middle lobe.
5. Bilateral pleural effusions, ascites, and anasarca.
6. Technically successful fine needle aspiration and core biopsy
of large left renal mass.
.
CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-11-1**] 12:13 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild spondylytic changes, without evidence of osseous
metastatic disease in the cervical spine.
.
CT T-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-11-1**] 12:12 PM
IMPRESSION: Allowing for differences in technique compared to
the prior MR, similar appearance of compression fracture of L1
with associated enhancing soft tissue mass. There is probably
similar severe canal stenosis as well as involvement of the
left-sided neural foramina at T12-L1 and L1-L2.
.
CT L-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2183-11-1**] 12:12 PM
IMPRESSION: Allowing for differences in technique compared to
the prior MR, similar appearance of compression fracture of L1
with associated enhancing soft tissue mass. There is probably
similar severe canal stenosis as well as involvement of the
left-sided neural foramina at T12-L1 and L1-L2.
.
MRA LUMBAR SPINE  [**2183-11-3**] 10:37 AM
IMPRESSION: Anterior spinal artery is not definitively
visualized.
L1 compression fracture and mass consistent with the patient's
known osseous metastasis.
.
XRAY L SPINE [**2183-11-9**]
Standing L-Spine; Hardware intact, no shift

Brief Hospital Course:
60 YO F with newly diagnosed metastatic renal CA and pathologic
with L1 compression fx and pain control. Patient underwent
decompression and fusion surgery.
.
1. L1 compression fracture:
- Patient had embolization procedure on [**2183-11-4**]
- Neurosurgery performed L1 vertebrectomy with T10 to L3
thoracolumbar fusion/instrumentation and tumor resection on
[**2183-11-5**]. She tolerated this procedure well and was transferred
to PACU post op and remained intubated overnight. On POD#1 she
was extubated. She had good LE strength. Sh
