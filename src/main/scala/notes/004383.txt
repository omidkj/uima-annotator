History of Present Illness:
50 F with hx of synovial carcinoma dx in [**2159**] on C1D5 2nd line
gemcitabine/docetaxel w/ recent admission for uncontrolled
abdominal pain managed with narcotics, who presents with AMS
since Sunday. Pt and husband relayed the history together and
reported that pt took 2 30mg tabs of morphine and 2 tabs 10mg
oxycodone on Saturday night and slept through until Sunday
morning. Husband reports that pt awoke before him and took 1
30mg tab of morhpine and 1 tab 10mg oxycodone and did ok for the
beginning of the morning but when they went to watch tv, she
fell asleep and he was unable to wake her. He called 911 and
when the EMS came, they were also unable to wake her until they
picked her up to move her. She then awoke and was taken to Good
[**Hospital 39887**] Hospital, where he reports they gave her two "shots"
of a medication he did not know and she awoke and improved, and
subsequently was sent home.

Additionally, she reports low urine output for a few days

constipation. She also endorses dysuria and hematuria for the

that lasted throughout the night, along with speaking
non-sensical words and sentences. Otherwise, she denies chest
pain, sob, vomiting, diarrhea. She reports her son has a dry
cough at home, but no other sick contacts.

Of note, pt had recent admission for abdominal pain after CT
abd/pelvis on [**5-31**] showed large intra-abdominal mass with mass
effect on the SMV and gallbladder, apparently new from
[**2162-2-22**]. She was managed in conjunction with palliative care,
and her pain was controlled with oxycontin 30mg in the AM, 60mg
in the PM, and 60mg qHS, along with morphine PCA. She did not
show any evidence of somnolence or AMS w/ this dosing. She was
given MS Contin upon discharge, to be taken as 60mg in the
morning, 60mg in the afternoon, and 90mg in the evening, along
with Oxycodone 20-30mg q3h as needed for pain. Additionally, she
was started on 2nd line chemotherapy for her synovial sarcoma
and given 1 dose of gemcitabine on [**2162-6-4**], to which she had an
expected fever, but otherwise tolerated well. She has had recent
reports of suicidal attempts/ideation, though on her recent
hospitalization, she denied suicidal ideation and voiced a
safety plan prior to discharge.

In the ED, initial VS were:  98.8 94 83/43 18 100% 2L. Patient
was given 2 liters NS, and patient was started on Levophed with
improvement in blood pressures. Labs notable for [**Last Name (un) **] with
BUN/Creatinine 42/5.1, hyponatremia 128, ALT/AST elevated to
302/761, Uric Acid 10.5, HCT down slightly from baseline. Blood
cultures sent. CT head without evidence of intracranial mass or
other acute process. CT abdomen per report with worsening liver
and lung mets compressing SVC. CXR with left sided central line,
unchanged left basal/apical masses, no interval change. Patient
was given Naloxone 0.2mg without improvement in symptoms,
Vancomycin/Zosyn. Vitals prior to transfer HR: 94, BP: 96/55,
94% on 2L.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were 99.4 99 88/48 20 96%
2L. She is resting in bed comfortably, drowsy but arousable and
interactive. She reports [**5-11**] RUQ pain but otherwise is feeling
okay. She endorses the symptoms described above, which is
confirmed by her husband, who is at her bedside.

[**2162-6-8**] URINE CULTURE negative

IMAGING
[**2162-6-7**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Little interval change from the
prior study, with the basal and left apical masses. No
definitive acute interval change.

[**2162-6-7**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: Stable extraxial lesion-likely
meningioma. no evidence of intracranial metastatic disease,
however, MRI is more sensitive for the detection of such
lesions.

[**2162-6-7**] CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST:
1.  Multiple pleural-based metastases in the left lung base, one
abutting the left ventricle.  If there is concern for
hemodynamic abnormalities, an echocardiogram may be considered
to evaluate functional mass ef
