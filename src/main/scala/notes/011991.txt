CC:[**CC Contact Info 76470**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM X 2


History of Present Illness:
HPI: The pt is a 65yo M who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] after
presenting there with new-onset severe headache. He had called
EMS and on their arrival he was awake and alert, apparently
drunk, complaining of [**11-8**] headache and stated that he was "too
weak to stand". He was taken to [**Hospital1 **], where he is well
known
and given morphine. His headache did not improve
and then he had N/V x 2, became "minimally responsive" and was
taken for CT scan, which revealed R parietal ICH and b/l SDH. He
was intubated/sedated/paralyzed, loaded with dilantin and
labetalol for sbp as high as 210's. He also had epidose of brady
to 30s and SBP in 200s in [**Hospital1 18**] ED. He was given mannitol 100g x
1 after head CT here.

The pt was unable to offer a history at the time of my
encounter.
The history is per transfer note and ED physician.

Pertinent Results:
CT [**1-15**]:

- CTH: prelim read - 1.  Large intraparenchymal hematoma within
the right parietal and occipital lobes with resultant mass
effect
and leftward subfalcine herniation as described above.  16 mm
nodular component may represent evolving hemorrhage,
although underlying lesion cannot be excluded.
  2.  Bilateral subdural hematomas as well as subdural blood
tracking along the
falx and layering over the tentorium.
  3.  Confluent hypodensities within the right frontal and left
parietal lobes
possibly representing vasogenic edema.

- CT c-spine: 1.  No fracture.
  2.  Nasogastric tube is coiled within the oropharynx.
  3.  See head CT scan performed on the same day for further
description of known intraparenchymal and subdural hematomas.
  4.  Scattered cervical lymph nodes, including 10 mm node
within
the right posterior cervical triangle, which may be reactive but
can be clinically correlated.
CT [**1-15**]: CTA HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST
FINDINGS:  The non-contrast examination demonstrates a reduction
in the
severity of mass effect and right to left midline shift since
the prior study. Again identified are small bilateral subdural
hematomas, larger on the right than left, these appear smaller
than on the prior examination.  The small subdural hematoma
along the falx also appears to have reduced in size.  Again
identified are bilateral white matter hypodensities in the
frontal and parietal lobes.  These are of uncertain
significance.  The prior spiculation that they may represent
contusions was based on the belief that the patient had suffered
trauma.  In the absence of trauma, their significance is
uncertain, and evaluation with MR may be helpful.  Considering
the findings discussed below, the possibility of venous ischemia
should be considered.
The CT arteriogram demonstrates a grossly dilated vein along the
posterior
margin of the hematoma.  This drains superiorly to enter the
superior sagittal sinus.  There are mildly prominent vessels
along the inferior and medial margins of the hematoma.  These
may represent simply crowded vessels due to mass effect from the
hematoma.  However, the possibility of an arteriovenous
malformation should be considered.  Although the varix with
little evidence of a definite nidus is a common finding in dural
arterial venous fistulas, a prominent intraparenchymal vessel,
and of course the hematoma, raise a concern of any
intraparenchymal arteriovenous malformation.  Correlation with a
catheter arteriogram is recommended.

These findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 3:00 p.m. on
[**2125-1-15**].

CONCLUSION:  Decrease in mass effect since the earlier study of
[**2124-1-16**].

The CTA demonstrates a large venous varix along the posterior
margin of the hematoma.

There are questionable prominent vessels along the inferior and
medial margins of the hematoma.

These findings suggest an arteriovenous fistula or malformation.
 This may be pial or dural.  Correlation with catheter
arteriography is recommended.

Bilateral deep white matter hypodensities of uncertain
significance.  These may represent venous ischemia.  Correlation
with magnetic resonance imaging is recommended.
MRI [**1-15**]: MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST
FINDINGS:
The previously noted large intraparenchymal hematoma in the
right
parietooccipital lobe, is again noted.  Note is also made of
large venous
varix, noted on the posteromedial aspect of the hematoma.  No
significant
change is noted in the hematoma, venous varix, mild perilesional
edema.
On the axial FLAIR sequence, there are multiple areas of
hyperintensity in the right frontal white matter-subcortical,
periventricular locations  and in the centrum semiovale as well
as in the left posterior frontal centrum semiovale with no
corresponding abnormality on the susceptibility sequence or the
diffusion-weighted sequences.  These may represent changes
related to vascular ischemic disease, likely related to chronic
macrovessel occlusive disease and less likely to be venous
infarctions, given the lack of abnormality on the diffusion
sequences. No abnormal enhancement is noted in these lesions.
The ventricles and extraaxial CSF spaces are unremarkable.
Mild increased signal in the sphenoid sinus, ethmoid air cells,
and the left maxillary sinus, reflect small amount of fluid
versus mucosal thickening along with a small retention cyst in
the left maxillary sinus measuring 0.9 x 0.9 cm.

IMPRESSION:

1.  Right parietoccipital large intraparenchymal hematoma, with
large venous varix and a few prominent vessels adjacent to it,
image may represent AV fistula/AVM.  To consider followup CT
angiogram after resolution of the hematoma, to reassess for
underlying vascular lesions.

However, conventional angiogram is the ideal study, for
definitive assessment.

2.  Multiple FLAIR hyperintense lesions in the cerebral white
matter, on both sides, predominantly in the right frontoparietal
and left posterior frontal and a few in the bilateral temporal
subcortical white matter, which most likely represent sequelae
of vascular ischemic disease like chronic microvessel occlusive
disease and less likely to be related to venous origin, given
the lack of abnormalities on the gradient echo and
diffusion-weighted sequences.

A short-term followup MRI scan of the head, can be considered,
as no prior MR studies are available, for the white matter FLAIR
hyperintense areas.
