Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
FINDINGS: There are numerous small areas of parenchymal
contusion
and subarachnoid hemorrhage involving both frontal lobes and
left
temporal lobe. Hyperdensity along the left tentorial leaf is
consistent with subdural hematoma. There is no shift of normally
midline structures, mass effect, hydrocephalus, or evidence of
acute major vascular territorial infarction. Included in the
field of view are acute nondisplaced fractures of the lateral
and
medial walls of the right orbit, right temporal bone, left
sphenoid, and left zygoma, which extends into the lateral wall
of
the left orbit. There is a small amount of fluid in the left
frontal sinus air cell and the nasopharynx and several ethmoid
air cells are opacified possibly due to blood. The mastoid air
cells are clear. There is mild underlying maxillary sinus
mucosal
thickening which is probably chronic. There are a few small
locules of gas within the right orbit, but no evidence of
retroorbital hematoma.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Multifocal areas of parenchymal contusion and subarachnoid
hemorrhage involving the frontal lobes and left temporal lobe.
2.  Small subdural hematoma layering along the left tentorial
leaf.
3.  Multiple nondisplaced fractures are better seen on the
companion CT sinus facial bone study and reference to this
report
is suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the ICU and monitored closely. He was
extubated on HD#2. His neurologic exam improved and he became
less lethargic.  He was following all commands. Ct of c-spine
showed C6 facet fracture and he was kept in the hard collar. His
diet and activity were advanced. He was transferred to the
floor.  He was seen by PT and OT who worked with him a couple
visits and ultimately cleared him for discharge to home.
