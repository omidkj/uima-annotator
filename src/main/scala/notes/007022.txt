History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 83718**] is a 60M h/o dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension
presents after episode palpitations, dizziness at home. He had
just finished a large meal and was drinking a 'few' rum and
cokes when he developed a fluttering in his chest, weakness, and
lightheadness. He denies any chest pain, nausea, shortness of
breath, or diaphoresis. Upon EMS arrival he was in a rapid wide
complex tachycardia near 300 bpm presumed VT. Per report, he was
hypotensive and cardioverted x1 into sinus rhythm. He was given
amiodarone 150 mg IV (infiltrated), then started on an
amiodarone IV drip.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. He had been feeling
well prior to this episode but does not occasional similar short
lived palpitations that last <1min and spontaneously resolve.
All of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  His weight
has been stable recently, and notes mainly weight loss over the
past months.

In the ED, initial vitals were 98.4 94 103/66 12 99. He has
remained asymptomatic with stable vital signs. ECG upon arrival
with LBB and frequent PVCs.

STUDIES:
TTE ([**2124-12-23**]): The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is severely dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 10-15%). The estimated cardiac
index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**1-13**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic
dysfunction and a low cardiac index. Mild to moderate aortic
regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension.
.
TTE ([**2124-12-29**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There
is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF
= 30). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated
at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2124-12-23**], the left ventricle, while still
hypocontractile and markedly dilated, is significnatly improved
in terms of ejection fraction and stroke volume.
.
CXR ([**2124-12-23**]): Cardiomegaly and moderate pulmonary edema
.
Abdomen US ([**2124-12-30**]): 1. Patent hepatic veins and portal vein.
2. Coarse liver echotexture may represent diffuse hepatic
disease and cirrhosi and/or fibrosis can not be excluded on this
study.
3. 1-cm echogenic lesion in the right lobe of the liver may
represent hemangioma. Correlation with prior imaging is
recommended. In case of underlying liver disease and/or concern
for hepatic malignancy this lesion can be followed with MRI in 6
months.
4. 7-mm left renal angiomyolipoma.
.
CT chest/abdomen/pelvis ([**2124-12-31**]): IMPRESSION:
1. Bibasilar consolidations with nodular opacities within the
lungs. These findings are likely related to a multifocal
pneumonia vs. aspiration pneumonia.
2. Cardiomegaly, enlargement of the main pulmonary artery and
interstitial thickening, likely on the basis of fluid overload.
3. Exten
