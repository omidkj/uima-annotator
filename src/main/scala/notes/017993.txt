CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Inferior myocardial infarction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 56 year-old female
with a history of type 2 diabetes insulin requiring and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who presents with jaw
pain, dyspnea, and diaphoresis.  The patient was recently
discharged from an outside hospital on [**2171-4-12**] after being
treated for a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
exacerbation.  On the evening prior to admission the patient
was feeling unwell and contact[**Name (NI) **] her primary care physician
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 807**] who recommended that the patient take
[**Location (un) 2452**] juice for presumed hypoglycemia.  This a.m. the
patient went to the primary care physician's office and
complained of jaw pain, dyspnea at rest and diaphoresis.  She
was immediately sent to [**Hospital6 **] for evaluation.
An ECG on arrival there demonstrated Q waves in 2, 3 and F
with [**Street Address(2) 4793**] elevations inferiorly and 1 mm down sloping ST
segments with T wave inversions in V2 to V5.  A CK was drawn,
which was 400 with an MB of 50 and troponin was 30.  The
patient was diagnosed with an inferior myocardial infarction
and started on intravenous nitroglycerin, Aggrastat, heparin,
Lopressor, morphine sulfate, Solu-Medrol and nebulizers and
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] was
arranged.  A chest x-ray obtained at [**Hospital6 **] was
consistent with hyperinflated lungs and moderate congestive
heart failure.  The patient developed prior to transfer
worsening dyspnea and became hypertensive to 230/140 with
worsened hypoxia.  The patient was then intubated after
additional morphine, Fentanyl, Lopressor, nitroglycerin and
Lasix were administered.  The patient became hypotensive to
an SBP of 65 and she required Dopamine for approximately
thirty minutes.  The Dopamine was discontinued and the
patient was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.  Her post
intubation arterial blood gas was 7.13, 76 and 424 on unknown
settings.

On arrival to the Coronary Care Unit the patient was
complaining of nausea, diaphoresis and dyspnea.  She was
hemodynamically stable and treated with intravenous Ativan.
Within 20 minutes the patient stabilized on the vent.  ecg
demonstrated persistent elevations inferiorly with down
sloping ST depressions from V2 to V5.  She was taken to the
catheterization laboratory where her right heart
catheterization revealed the following, a PA diastolic of 32
with a wedge of 31 and a mixed venous O2 sat of 66%.  Her
left heart catheterization revealed the following, left main
showed no obstruction, left anterior descending coronary
artery showed a 50% D1, left circumflex shoed a 90% lesion
with an ulcer that was stented and an right coronary artery
that showed a 90% lesion and distal 50% lesion.  She received
a stent to the mid right coronary artery lesion and
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to the distal
right coronary artery lesion.  Her post catheterization
electrocardiogram was notable for Q waves in 2, 3 and F and
persistent down sloping ST depressions in V2 to V5.  She was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit in stable condition for
further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.  No home O2 use.  No intubations for chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations in the past.  2.
Type 2 diabetes insulin requiring exacerbated on Prednisone.
3.  Depression.  4.  Status post cholecystectomy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  There is a greater then fifty pack year
history of tobacco use.  The patient continues to smoke.
There is occasional alcohol use, but no elicit drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1.  Zyflow.  2.  Uniphyl.  3.
Combivent.  4.  Serevent.  5.  Prednisone.  6.  Mavik.  7.
Prozac.  8.  Amaryl.  9.  Insulin 70/30 sliding scale.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs temperature
97.7.  Pulse 70.  Blood pressure 120/70.  Respiratory rate
16.  O2 sat 100%.  Vent settings IMV 12 by 800 with no
spontaneous respirations.  40% FIO2 and PEEP of 7.5.
Arterial blood gas is 7.4, 42, and 133.  In general, this is
an intubated and sedated female.  HEENT examination revealed
normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are equal, round and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  The
trachea is midline.  The trachea venous pressure is estimated
to be 12 cm of water.  The neck is supple with a full range
of motion.  Cardiovascular normal rhythm, regular rate.  No
murmurs or rubs.  Positive S4.  Pulmonary clear to
auscultation bilaterally on anterior examination alone.
Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.  Normoactive bowel
sounds.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities warm, left
bilateral lower extremities with 1+ edema.  Pulses are 2+.
Groin reveals a small palpable 1 by 1 cm hematoma lateral to
cannulation site with no overlying bruit.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 20, hematocrit 40,
platelets 224, coags 15, 65 and 1.6.  SMA 7 140, 4.3, 104,
23, 50, 1.0 and 279.  CK of 2252, MB is 219 and a troponin
greater then 50.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit for post inferior myocardial infarction.
Management, she was extubated within the first day after the
procedure.  She diuresed well to moderate doses of Lasix.
Her peak CK was 2789 and was noted to be trending down.  She
was chest pain free for the remainder of her admission.

In regard to the groin hematoma, no bruit developed and the
size of the hematoma remained stable.  The patient's
hematocrit remained roughly 37.  The patient's white count
also declined as she was stabilized.

In regard to the patient's oxygenation and ventilation she
was noted to have bibasilar rales by hospital day three, but
an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.  Her chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease regimen while in house included
Prednisone 60 mg po q day, Albuterol and Atrovent MDI and
long acting beta agonist was also added to the regimen.  She
also was maintained on the montelukast she takes at home.

The patient did have some coffee ground emesis in the setting
of anticoagulation with Aggrastat, chronic steroid use and
the acute stress of the myocardial infarction, this was all
noted to resolve after the 2B3A inhibitor was discontinued
and the patient was maintained on proton pump inhibitor.

On hospital day number three the patient developed paroxysmal
atrial flutter with variable block with a rate as high as the
140s.  She was hemodynamically stable and spontaneously
converted after receiving Diltiazem for rate control.

On the following day a transthoracic echocardiogram was
obtained, which revealed an EF of 30 to 35% with an E to A
ratio of 2.4 and an estimated PA systolic pressure of 21 mm.
Her left atrium was noted to be mildly dilated at 5.6 cm.
There was also mild left ventricular dilatation noted and
multiple regions of resting wall motion abnormalities
including inferolateral akinesis and inferoseptal
hypokinesis, 2+ MR was also noted on the echocardiogram.  No
spontaneous echocardiogram contrast was observed.  In light
of the patient's multiple risk factors for the development of
cerebrovascular accident, the decision was made to
anticoagulate.  The patient was started on Lovenox and
Coumadin while in house, which she will continue on the
outside.  EP consultation was also obtained.  The final
recommendations of which are pending.

I communicated with the patient's primary care physician
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 807**] regarding this hospitalization and in
particular the diagnosis of depressed EF and paroxysmal
atrial flutter necessitating anticoagulation.  He agreed with
the management and planned on seeing the patient in one
week's time after discharge from the hospital.

On [**2171-4-24**], after physical therapy had seen the patient she
is felt to be stable for discharge.  The results of pulmonary
function tests are pending at the pre
