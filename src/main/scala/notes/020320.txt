REPORT COVERS ICU COURSE FROM [**0-0-**]:  This is
a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male, a resident of [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, who came to
the Emergency Room with chief complaint of nausea, vomiting,
shortness of breath and fever.  He was found to be hypoxic,
hypotensive and febrile by EMS with blood pressure of
80/palp, heart rate 130, respiratory rate 40, O2 sat 79% on 5

as well as 4 liters of normal saline, and was started on
Levophed for his pressors.

platelets 404, sodium 143, potassium 2.6, chloride 114,
bicarbonate 11, BUN 54, creatinine 2.4, glucose 175, anion
gap 18, change in his anion gap/change in his bicarbonate

admission shows a left lower lobe infiltrate and a right IJ
central line in good position.  Urinalysis - specific gravity
1.021, small blood, [**1-20**] white cells, [**10-7**] red cells, 0
bacteria, positive hyaline casts.  EKG - sinus rhythm, 96,
normal axis, normal intervals, 0.[**Street Address(2) 1755**] depressions V1
through V3.

PERTINENT STUDIES THIS ADMISSION:  [**2146-12-5**], the patient
had a portable KUB to assess for ?bowel obstruction, and it
did show a possibility of early partial small bowel
obstruction, and recommended follow-up.  Follow-up study done
on [**2146-12-7**] showed no evidence for intestinal obstruction.
CT of the head without contrast done [**2146-12-9**]--this was
done for a history of prior CVA with now change in mental
status.  It showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage, and
tissue loss noted in the left thalamus consistent with his
old known hemorrhagic stroke.
Ultrasound of his right upper extremity done [**2146-12-12**] for
edematous right arm showed nonocclusive clot within the right
IJ and one of his two brachial veins thrombosed.

HOSPITAL COURSE FROM [**0-0-0**]:  This is a
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old male, with a history of chronic diarrhea, past
hemorrhagic CVA, who was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 12573**] Intensive
Care Unit with an aspiration pneumonia after vomiting, and
subsequent development of sepsis and respiratory failure.
Postextubation, it was noted that the patient had new left
leg weakness and left facial droop with new dysarthria.

1) SEPTIC SHOCK:  This was likely secondary to a SIRS
reaction, status post severe aspiration pneumonia and
pneumonitis.  The patient was admitted on the MUST sepsis
protocol.  During his first hospital day, he was hypotensive
and required both Levophed and vasopressin to keep his mean
arterial pressure greater than 65, his lactic acidosis peaked
with a lactate level of 6.0, and he was placed on a
bicarbonate drip in the setting of both nongap and anion gap
acidosis.  He also required an insulin drip.  His cortisol
stimulation test was negative with a baseline cortisol of 100
in the setting of his sepsis which is an appropriate
response.  His aspiration pneumonia was treated with a 9-day
course of ceftazidime, vancomycin and Flagyl to cover
nosocomial aspiration.  The vancomycin was switched to
oxacillin after sensitivities came back on a Staph aureus
that grew out of his sputum that showed it to be sensitive to
oxacillin.

The patient improved rapidly after his early intervention in
sepsis therapy and was weaned off vasopressors by hospital
day #2.  He completed the remainder of his antibiotic course
and did not have any further temperature spikes for the
remainder of his ICU course.

2) RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient required intubation for
respiratory distress in the setting of acute aspiration
pneumonia and pneumonitis, as well as increased respiratory
drive from two metabolic acidosis processes.  He was able to
be quickly weaned off his ventilator, as his sepsis also
rapidly improved.  He was extubated on [**2146-12-8**] after some
diuresis to remove volume that had been given during his
acute sepsis.  He remained extubated and has gradually had
improving pulmonary toilet over the past few days.  The
patient is currently on a scoop mask with 12 liters of flow
and has had stable O2 sats of 95% or greater since then.

3) NEUROLOGIC:  After extubation, it became apparent that Mr.
[**Known lastname 12574**] had a new left-sided facial droop, dysarthria,
dysphagia, and left leg weakness.  A head CT done to rule out
any acute bleed was negative and showed only has old known
hemorrhagic infarct, as well as multiple lacunar events.  His
neurologic deficits have been gradually improving over the
past few days, and currently his dysarthria is much improved.
He has 3/5 strength to the muscles in his left leg, and has
4/5 strength to muscles in his left arm, and his facial droop
is also improved.  He currently is requiring NG tube for
feeding, as he has failed his speech and swallow evaluation.
The plan will be to reevaluate him on Monday, [**12-19**], to
see if his swallowing has improved with his improved
dysarthria.  He will be continued on an aspirin a day for
stroke prophylaxis.  It is likely that this stroke occurr
