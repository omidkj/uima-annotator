History of Present Illness:
This 64-year-old gentleman was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] 1 day prior
to this operation for [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 36688**] Hospital. While there, he was
found to have a deteriorating course after 13 days of treatment
for acute gallstone pancreatitis. He had been treated with
steroids for presumed COPD exacerbation and also was placed on
anticoagulation with Coumadin for atrial fibrillation. There is
concern for pancreatic abscess and he was transferred to our
care. We performed a CAT scan that did infact delineate gas in
the pancreatic bed. With these findings, we reversed his
anticoagulation and took him to the operating room the following
day for a pancreatic debridement and abscess drainage.

Brief Hospital Course:
Went to OR as described above. Turbid fluid was found in
subhepatic space. Large retroperitoneal abscess, pancreatic
abscess. 3 drains placed in lesser sac and open cholecystectomy
performed. Imipenem begun at OSH was continued post-op,
fluconazole was added was added [**10-2**]. [**11-26**] blood culture bottles
positive for klebsiella sensitive to imipenem. Same grew from
peritoneal fluid. On [**9-30**] he went into afib s/p unsuccessful
DCCV. He was converted to NSR with amiodorone. Asymptomatic,
ruled out for MI. Afib thought to be secondary to fever,
infection. Cardiology consulted and recommended continuing with
beta blocker only. Remained rate controlled but in afib over
next 2 weeks. Imipenem course (14days post-op) was completed and
antibiotics were stopped on [**10-15**]. Calorie counts revealed that
he was taking very little oral calories and nutrition helped
with J-tube feed recommendations. Patient's blood glucose levels
remained within control, he was afebrile, and he began getting
out of bed with PT to a chair. Staples on the abdominal incision
were removed. Rehab screening began, however several days after
the antibiotics were stopped he spiked one night to 102. Wound
was partially opened for examination given the fevers and Chest
x-ray, UA were negative, and the CVL was removed (no growth on
the line tip culture). Flagyl was started empirically for
diarrhea (despite negative c difficile studies), and vancomycin
was addded when he continued to have low grade fevers over the
next 2 days. Blood cultures were negative, however a culture
from the JP fluid grew several gram negatives, including
klebsiella. Infectious disease service was re-consulted and
recommended continuing with zosyn only (and for 4 weeks
probably). A picc line was placed in IR for this purpose.
Patient also began to have rapid afib with the febrile episodes,
cariology again consulted and he was controlled with PO
lopressor and PO diltiazem. They did not feel that he was a good
candidate for DC cardioversion at this time. By [**10-19**] patient
was afebrile, pain well-controlled, getting out of bed daily and
heart rate within normal parameters. He is being discharged to
rehab with follow-up planned and weekly labs. Please continue
with twice daily wet to dry dressing changes on the open parts
of the abdominal incisions. The 2 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drains will also
need to be kept to suction and emptied every shift. They are
draining remains of necrotic pancreas and normally have a
greyish color.
