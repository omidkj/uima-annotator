LIVER
In summary, the patient had an increase in her LFTs throughout
the early admission peaking around [**11-26**], though she continued
to have synthetic dysfunction as noted by her indirect
bilirubinemia, coagulopathy, hypoglycemia.

[**2112-11-23**]   Radiology CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST
1. No fracture identified.
2. Straightening of the normal cervical lordosis could be due to
presence of cervical collar.
3. Multilevel degenerative changes. In the setting of trauma,
cannot exclude ligamentous injury and would recommend MRI to
exclude possible ligamentous injury if clinical concern
warrants.
4. Large right-sided layering pleural effusion.

[**2112-11-23**]   Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
There is a right basal effusion with atelectasis in the right
lower lobe.
Left lung is clear. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unremarkable. Follow up is recommended to ensure clearance of
the effusion and re-expansion of the right lower lobe.

[**2112-11-23**]   Radiology DUPLEX DOP ABD/PEL LIMI
1. No portal vein thrombosis.
2. Small ascites with no pocket large enough to mark for
paracentesis.
3. Large right pleural effusion.
4. Gallbladder distention without wall thickening,
pericholecystic fluid,
   or cholelithiasis.
5. Cirrhotic liver with limited evaluation for focal lesion as
described.

[**2112-11-23**]   Radiology CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
1. No intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Air-fluid level within the right maxillary sinus and mucosal
thickening
of the ethmoid, sphenoid and frontal sinus. These changes likely
represent
sinus disease, however, in the setting of trauma, cannot exclude
an occult
fracture. If the mechanism of injury suggests fracture, would
recommend
dedicated sinus CT to further evaluate.

[**2112-12-1**]   Radiology DUPLEX DOPP ABD/PEL POR
1. Patency and appropriate directional flow of the visualized
portal and
hepatic venous branches, with limitations described above.
2. Splenomegaly.
3. Ascites.
4. Sludge in the gallbladder.

Thoracentesis on [**11-25**] was transudative with negative culture

The patient had alpha strep in her urine on admission; all other
cultures from blood, mini-BAL, sputum did not grow.

Brief Hospital Course:
SEPSIS,
The patient was admitted with respiratory distress and preceding
symptoms of a respiratory tract infec
