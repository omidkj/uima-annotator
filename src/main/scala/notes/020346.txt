Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization [**2170-6-21**]
Cardiac catheterization [**2170-6-22**], impella supported with drug
eluting stents placed to left main and LAD
PICC placement [**2170-6-23**]

History of Present Illness:
82-year-old woman post NSTEMI (infero-lateral ST dep and TWI TnT
6.41 presenting as CHF post L THR on [**2170-2-12**] and at angiography
there was evidence of two vessel coronary artery disease
including a 90% proximal stenosis and a 30% mid-vessel stenosis
and occluded RCA. The proximal LAD lesion was stented with a
bare metal stent. In addition, there was evidence of
biventricular diastolic dysfunction and mild pulmonary arterial
hypertension. Following her operation, she had a period of
rehabilitation and was back to her baseline by [**2170-5-8**] at
which point she was able to walk 50ft with a cane. By [**2170-5-30**]
she became progressively short of breath such that prio to
admition she had difficulty mobilizing to the bathroom. Her
shortness of breath was more sever over the past 2 weeks
although she denied any SOB at rest. In adition, she developed
worsening orthopnea (4 pillows) with previously no requirement
of no greater than 1 pillow. She noted increasing lower
extremity edema and an increase in her weight from 112lb to
119lb. She initially was on 40mg od of furosemide which was
increased to 40mg [**Hospital1 **] and latterly metolazone was added. Due to
hypotension which was otherwise asymptomatic (SBP in 80s) her
lisinopril was reduced from 5mg to 2.5mg daily. Due to her
symptoms, she presented for a repeat echocardiogram on [**6-19**]
which showed significant worsening of cardiac function, an EF of
15%, significant AS, and moderate to severe MR. She was admitted
for repeat coronary angiography.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or
red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. She noted a four day
history of dull epigastric discomfort at night that started [**5-28**]
which was attributed to heartburn, however not relieved by
ranitidine, that spontaneously resolved before planned
assessment with U/S. No urinary complaints. There were no other
positive symptoms.
.
Cardiac review of systems revealed no evidence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

knee popliteal artery bypass with in situ saphenous vein and an
open transluminal angioplasty of the anterior tibial and below

Originally Hungarian. Current teacher of science and art to

and limited to 3ft. 16 steps into house.

[**Month/Day/Year **] [**2170-6-19**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 15 %) secondary to
akinesis of the entire interventricular septum, anterior free
wall, inferior free wall, and apex. The only segments of the
left ventricle that are not akinetic or
