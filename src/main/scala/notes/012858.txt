Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 949**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Combined MICU admit and medicine accept note
.
67 yo F with hepatic cirrhosis possibly due to NASH, esophageal
varices, aortic stenosis, previous admissions for worsening
encephalopathy, DM2, was admitted on [**9-16**] with dyspnea on
exertion, jaundice, weight gain. In the ED, she was found to
have worsening liver function from baseline, with worsening
hyperbilirubinemia, elevated INR, and new hepatofugal flow on
RUQ US indicative of worsening portal HTN. She was also
hypotensive with SBP 80-90, was given 1L IVF, and was
transferred to MICU Green.
.
Over the 2 days prior to admission, the patient noted increasing
dyspnea on exertion and was approximately 20 lbs above her dry
weight (237lbs from dry weight of 219lbs). On admission she
denied any medication non-compliance, chest pain, melena,
hematemesis or BRBPR. She denies EtOH use. She has been having
[**12-23**] BMs per day on lactulose. Two months ago the patient was
taken off of celebrex due to persistent anemia and she began
taking 500-1000mg tylenol daily for arthritis pain (in
accordance with hepatologist recommendations).
.
The patient was recently hospitalized 1 week prior to admission
at [**Hospital1 18**]. She described 2-3 weeks of generally feeling unwell,
including increased post-prandial abdominal pain. By the
patient's report, she also had a hyperbilirubinemia and
underwent a HIDA scan revealing gallstones (at [**Hospital3 **]).
.
In the MICU over the past day, her SBP had improved from 80s to
120s. She was diuresed 500 ml with lasix gtt and was
transitioned to PO lasix per home regimen.
Diagnostic/therapeutic paracentesis showed WBC 303, poly 14%,
with 1.5 L removed. Peritoneal fluid gram stain and culture are
pending. The patient states that she feels better now.
.
She reports some vomiting in evening here after transfer from
MICU (with "bile" material); she had a similar episode yesterday
morning. She reports no abdominal pain. She has had no recent
bowel movements. Before she came to the hospital she had "the
runs" since she had started lactulose. She reports being
somewhat short of breath but at her baseline which she reports
is because she has "aortic stenosis and asthma"; she says she
has had slight wheezing.
ROS: Denies chest pain, palpitations, orthopnea, PND,
hemoptysis, hematemesis, hematochezia. Describes [**12-23**] BM's per
day prior; none recently. Notes increased fatigue.

STUDIES:
Abd U/S ([**2147-5-31**]): Cirrhosis. A focal contour abnormality
within
the left liver lobe measuring approximately 2.2 x 1.4 x 2.2 cm
is slightly hypoechoic compared with background, with mild
increased through transmission, but no internal vascularity.
There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Multiple
calcified gallstones are seen within a normal- appearing
gallbladder. The spleen is enlarged at 13.8 cm.
.
EGD ([**2147-5-31**]): Esophagus: A sliding small size hiatal hernia
was seen. Localized friability of the mucosa with no bleeding
was noted in the lower third of the esophagus. These findings
are compatible with mild reflux. Stomach: Normal. Duodenum:
Normal.
.
Echo ([**2147-10-16**]): 1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. 2.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. 3. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis (area 0.8-1.19cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. 4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is severe mitral annular calcification. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
5. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
CT abd/pelvis ([**2148-7-9**]): Nodular, cirrhotic liver. Within the
left lobe, there is a heterogeneous, hyperenhancing area with
contour
abnormality measuring approximately 7.8 x 5.5 cm. This area is
somewhat ill-defined and fills the majority of the anterior
aspect of the left lobe of the liver. In the region described on
outside MRI at the dome of the liver anterior to the inferior
vena cava, no focal mass lesion is identified. Given the
findings within the left lobe of the liver, multiphasic CT may
be used in three to six months to assess for stability.
Alternatively, this area is amenable to percutaneous biopsy if
clinically indicated. Splenomegaly. Gallstone is identified.
Trace ascites.
