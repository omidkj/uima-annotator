History of Present Illness:
82F with DM and hypertension presenting with intermittent chest
pain, shortness of breath and ankle edema.  Pt notes that one

ECHO (TTE): The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial
pressure is indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2136-2-11**] , the severity of mitral regurgitation
has increased.
.
Chest X-ray: In comparison with the study of [**6-5**], there is poor
due to poor definition of the right hemidiaphragm with increased
opacification at the right base, consistent with increasing
pleural effusion. Less prominent effusion with the basilar
atelectasis is seen on the left. Enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette persists. Elevation of pulmonary venous pressure is
again noted. The patient has taken a relatively better
inspiration. IMPRESSION: Continued cardiomegaly with bilateral
pleural effusions and elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
.
Left Foot X-ray: No radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis or
bone destruction. Hallux valgus. Degenerative change at
interphalangeal joints.

INTERPRETATION: This 82 year old type 2 NIDDM woman with a
positive
stress test [**2136-2-11**] was referred to the lab for evaluation of
chest pain
and shortness of breath. The patient was infused with 0.142
mg/kg/min
of dipyridamole over 4 minutes. No arm, neck, back or chest
discomfort
was reported by the patient throughout the study. There were
NSSTTW
changes during the near peak infusion and in early recovery. The
rhythm
was sinus with rare isolated apbs. Appropriate hemodynamic
response to
the infusion. The dipyridamole was reversed with 125 mg of
aminophylline IV.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or significant ST segment
changes.
Nuclear report sent separately.
.
Nuclear stress report:
The image quality is satisfactory following the application of a
motion
correction algorithm to both rest and stress images, although
there remains attenuation by the patient's left arm. Left
ventricular cavity size is normal with an EDV of 80 ml.  Rest
and stress perfusion images reveal reduced photon counts in the
inferior wall which resolves with attenuation. However, there is
a moderate, reversible perfusion abnormality in the
inferolateral wall, persistent following attentuation
correction. Gated images reveal normal wall motion.  The
calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 56%.
IMPRESSION: 1. Moderate, reversible inferolateral wall defect
consistent with ischemia. 2. Normal LV cavity size with ejection
fraction of 56%.
.
Non-invasive Lower extremity Arterial: Doppler tracings
demonstrate triphasic waveforms at the femoral levels
bilaterally and at the left superficial femoral level. All other
waveforms are monophasic. At the tibial level on the right, no
Doppler tracings could be identified involving either the DP or
PT arteries. The volume recordings are in [**Location (un) **] with the
Doppler tracings. On the left the ABI is 0.68 based on the PT
artery and 0.61 based on the DP artery.

IMPRESSION: Findings as stated above which indicates:
1. Right-sided SFA disease and significant tibial disease. 2.
Distal left SFA versus proximal popliteal disease and tibial
disease.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 82F with PMH of DM, and HTN presenting with
chest pressure, shortness of breath and ankle edema.  BNP in ED,
markedly elevated at 7100.

# Acute Congestive Heart Failure- Last ECHO in [**2-10**] showed EF of
>55%.  However, given patient's presentation, concern for
diastolic dysfunction leading to acute heart failure
exacerbation.  She was intially admitted to CCU for diuresis and
symptomatically improved. She was continued on aspiri
