Pertinent Results:
Echo 08/24/12LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA. Good (>20
cm/s) LAA ejection velocity. No thrombus in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. PFO is
present.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Mildly depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Focal calcifications in aortic root. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta. Complex (>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta.
Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending
aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets. Mild
AS (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Moderate (2+) AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to
moderate [[**2-1**]+] TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Written informed consent was obtained from the
patient. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the
procedure. Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows. The
patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Resting bradycardia
for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage.
A patent foramen ovale is present and is identified only by
agitated saline with valsalva release. No PFO was identified by
color doppler or agitated saline at rest.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45
%). Mild global dysfunction.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened with calcification of the non coronry
cusp.There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.4 cm2).
Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no pericardial effusion.
Post bypass:
There is a well seated prosthetic valve in the aortic position
with no evidence of perivalvular leak. The peak and mean
gradients are 9 and 4 mm Hg respectively. There is no evidence
of aortic dissection. The estimated ejection fraction is
preserved and unchanged from prebypass.
No other new findings. Overall LVEF 45%.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2190-9-24**] where
the patient underwent Aortic valve replacement with a size #23
[**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] Magna tissue valve, Coronary artery bypass
graft x2:  Left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending artery, and saphenous vein graft to distal right
coronary artery. Endoscopic harvesting of the long saphenous
vein. See operative note for full details
Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well and
post-operatively was admitted to the CVICU in stable condition
for ongoing post-operative care and monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The patient
was transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication. The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility. He went into
a rate controlled atrial flutter on POD 2 and he was continued
on beta blockers with low dose oral Amiodarone  started (rate
was 60's). He was in rate controlled atrial flutter for >24
hours and Coumadin was started.  He received 2 mg Coumadin [**9-28**]
and [**9-29**] and INR goal was 2.0-2.5. Coumadin follow up was
arranged with PCP office for after discharge from rehab. He did
have some abdominal distention and KUB showed some dilated loops
of bowel but no ileus and he was given bowel medications with
good results. By the time of discharge on POD#6 the patient was
ambulating with assistance, the wound was healing well and pain
was controlled with oral analgesics. The patient was discharged
to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Rehab in good condition with appropriate
follow up instructions and appointments were advised.
