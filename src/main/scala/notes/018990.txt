History of Present Illness:
This 82 year old  female with known severe aortic stenosis with
complaints of significant dyspnea on minimal exertion, which is
limiting her daily activities. The most recent echocardiogram
from [**2195-8-25**] revealed critical AS with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] 0.5cm2 with
a peak gradient of 130mmHg and mean gradient of 64mmHg.
Catheterization in [**2195-9-24**] showed normal coronary
arteries. She was admitted for aortic valve replacement.

Pertinent Results:
PRE Bypass
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-26**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification. There
is moderate functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 6.4 mmHg,
MVA 1.5 cm2) due to mitral annular calcification. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. (MR decreased to 2+
prior to bypass) Findings discussed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **].
POST Bypass
Te LV is hyperdynamic. There is a well seated, well functioning
bioprosthesis in the aortic position. There is trace valvular
AI. The MR is now moderate (2+). The MVA now calculates to 1.7
cm with a mean MV gradient of 5.5. The remaining study is
unchanged from prebypass.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted on [**12-7**] and underwent surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
See operative note for details. She weaned from bypass on
Propofol and Neo Synephrine infusions.  She remained stable
condition. There was some transient oliguria which resolved with
diuretics.  Pressors weaned easily and she was extubated without
problem.  She transferred to the floor on POD 2 and mediastinal
CTs were removed uneventfully.

Physical Therapy was consulted for strength and mobility.
Diuresis towards her preoperative weight was begun and beta
blockers begun. Renal function was followed closely.

Temporary pacing wires were removed on POD 3 and
antihypertensives were adjusted for optimal control.  Metformin
was resumed and glucoses were fairly well controlled.  A stay at
rehabilitation was recommended for further recovery prior to
returning home.  Diuretics were continued at transfer as she was
still above her preoperative weight.

On [**12-11**] she was feeling well, her edema was markedly improved
and diuretics were changed to oral for another week.  She was
transferred to Five [**Hospital **] rehabilitation for furthe recovery.
Medications were as written along with folow up and
restrictions.
