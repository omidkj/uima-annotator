Attending:[**Doctor Last Name 1350**]
Chief Complaint:
Unstable neck fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Occipito cervical fusion O to C4 fusion


History of Present Illness:
81M with PMHx of primary speech apraxia, DM2, COPD, asbestosis,
and recent fall for which he was admitted and placed in a
[**Location (un) 2848**]-J collar (noted to have an old C1-C2 fracture) who
presents from rehab with concern for ill-fitting collar and
possible mental status changes. Patient was discharged to rehab
yesterday to rehab, and was reportedly complaining of nausea,
anorexia, dizziness, and headache. There was a question of
worsening of his apraxia. He required a 1:1 sitter last night
for agitation and was sent to the ED from his rehab for further
evaluation.
In the ED, initial VS were 98 90 157/70 15 95%. Labs were
significant for stable hyponatremia & anemia. Preliminary read
of non-contrast head CT showed no acute process. U/A was
negative. Patient did not receive any medications or fluids in
the ED; they did note that the patient fell asleep twice during
interview. Patient was seen by neurosurgery who felt that his
mental status was at baseline. They determined that there was no
acute neurosurgical issues and that his C-collar was
appropriately fit. Patient reportedly denied weakness or gait
abnormalities. Patient was admitted to medicine for placement,
as his rehab facility refused to take him back. Vital signs on
transfer were 98.5 ??????F (36.9 ??????C), Pulse: 99, RR: 16, BP: 139/70,
O2Sat: 94%RA.
On arrival to the floor, patient appears calm and comfortable.
Communication is difficult [**1-29**] apraxia, but pt able to answer
yes/no. He correctly circled (on a piece of paper) that he is at
the hospital and said "no" when asked if he was in pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
Initially, the patient was admitted to the medical service. An
extensive conversation with the HCP was had, who felt the
patient was at his baseline.  He was noted to be hypovolemic, no
worse than previous admission, and this was felt to be secondary
to hypovolemia, so he was managed with gentle IV hydration. He
was transferred to the neurosurgery service for work-up of his
cervical spine fracture.

On [**6-14**], after discussion with the HCP, it was determined that
the patient would be electively intubated on [**6-15**] and placed in
traction prior to undergoing occipital-cranial fusion.  He
remained hyponatremic with a sodium of 125. On [**6-16**], patient
remained intubated. He was taken out of traction in CT scanner
for a CT c-spine which showed stable c1/c2 fracture with good
reduction. On exam, MAE and squeezes hand. He was pre-oped for
OR on [**6-17**]. On [**6-17**] he was stable in the ICU, intubated, and on
cervical traction while awaiting OR for occipital to C2 fusion.
C0-C4 fusion was performed on [**6-17**] without any intraoperative
complications.On [**6-18**] patient remained stable, intubated in the
ICU. He was leethargic, but opened his eyes, squeezes hands and
moves toes bilaterally on command. Bronchoscopy showed airway
edema necesitating General Surgery consult for tracheostomy.
Traheostomy was performed on [**6-20**], he remained in the ICU until
[**6-23**] when he was transferred to floor. He was evaluated by
Speech Therapy prior to his transfer, on [**6-22**] and was seen again
once he was on the floor. On [**6-24**] he failed the speech and
swallow study and poorly tolerated his PMV. At that time PEG was
suggested but both patient and his HCP/nephew declined the PEG
citing limited evidence that it would improve his survival.
After further discussion on [**6-25**] the patient changed his mind
and agreed to have the PEG placed. PEG was placed on [**6-26**], tube
feeds were started on [**6-27**] and stopped. Tube feeds restarted on
[**6-28**] and found to be at goal per GI. Staples removed from
incisional wound on [**6-29**].
