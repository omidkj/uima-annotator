Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, wide complex tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Internal Cardiac Defibrillator placement
cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
78 y/o gentleman with chronic AF, known CAD--NSTEMI in [**8-28**] (3 x
13 mm Cypher to RPLV and 2.25 x 18 mm Cypher to LCx/OM; also
found to have 3-% LMCA, 70% mLAD with an 80% D1 and 90% D2),
repeat PCI in [**10-29**] with BMS to mid-LAD for 70% stenotic lesion,
possible ISR in [**2174**] with DES to LAD ([**Hospital1 3278**]), AS with most
recent estimate of [**Location (un) 109**] of 1.07 cm2, presents from [**Hospital1 **] ED where he was found to have an irregular wide-complex
tachycardia associated with chest pain.
.
The patient has a history of chronic stable angina, class II
Canadian Classification, able to walk about 1 mile or 1 flight
of stairs before angina and SOB.  Was in USOH when at 8PM
tonight noted anginal equivalent only increased in intensity
(SSCP radiating to L arm).  Took 3 SL NTG without relief.  Taken
to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where found to have Wide-complex tachycardia.
Given Morphine IV, metoprolol IV 5mg x 2, Amiodarone 150mg IV x
1, and started on a diltiazem bolus 20 mg and 5mg/hr gtt.
Rhythm appeared to convert to sinus when he was loaded on
stretcher for EMS and symptoms resolved.  Since then has had no
further episodes of AF and no further CP or SOB.  Of note, he
stopped Plavix 6 months ago at the advice of his cardiologist.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED his vitals were T 98.6  HR 61  BP 97/40  RR  25  87%
RA-> 100 % in NRB. Patient recieved 600 mg plavix x 1.  His BP
occasionally dropes to SBP of 80s which improved to 110s with
500cc of NS.
.
On arrival to CCU, patient was asymptomatic.
.
ROS was negative for fever, chills, abdominal pain, recent
BRBPR, melena, dysuria, hematuri.  Cough recently which patient
attributes to allergies.  On cardiac review of symptoms, in
addition to above, patient notes stable 2 pillow orthopnea, no
PND or claudication.
Occasional RLE edema.  All other review systems were negative.

ECHO [**2176-10-5**]: The left atrium is dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %) secondary to
akinesis of the basal septum and hypokinesis of the rest of the
left ventricle. There is considerable beat-tobeat variability of
the left ventricular ejection fraction due to an irregular
rhythm. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
.
CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION [**2176-10-7**]:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system revealed
diffuse calcified coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had mild
disease.  The LAD had widely patent stents, and total occlusion
of a moderate sized diagonal seen on prior catheterization from
[**2173-11-11**].  The distal 70% stenosis of the LAD was unchanged
versus prior.  The LCX had a widely patent stent, and mild
luminal irregularities.  The RCA was a large vessel, with
moderate calcification and serial 40-50% stenoses.  There was a
large RPL that had a 60% stenosis in the mid-vessel, which was
unchanged compared with prior.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed moderate-to-severe aortic
stenosis with mean gradient of 18 mmHg and estimated aortic
valve area of 1.0 cm2. There were elevated left and right-sided
filling pressures with mean RA pressure of 15, mean PCWP of 35
mmHg, and LVEDP of 29 mmHg.  Cardiac output was mildly depressed
at 4.0 L/min.
.
ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND [**2176-10-7**]:
1. Atherosclerotic aorta with AAA measuring 4.1 cm at the widest
diameter. Slight interval increase from the ultrasound of
[**2173-10-24**].
2. No hydronephrosis. Bilateral renal cysts.
3. No evidence of renal artery stenosis.
