Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 943**]
Chief Complaint:
OSH transfer for UGIB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD [**2110-6-20**]
TIPS [**2110-6-18**]


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 67 yo man with ah history of NASH cirrhosis, portal
hypertensive gastropathy transferred from [**Hospital **] hospital for
transfusion resistant anemia due to GI bleed.  According to the
patient and transfer documents, the patient has a long history
of GI bleeds (7 years) but no jaundice or impaired liver
function. Pt reports a series of cauterization procedures for
his bleeds and says he has not experienced any melanic stools
since last year.  At that time, he had been seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**]
who recommended TIPS,  but this was delcined by the patient.
.
The patient did not have any symptoms of his bleed since last
summer and therefore decided not seek further follow-up.  Pt
states he returned to his PCP 2 weeks ago after having abdominal
pain and notcing an umbilical hernia.  Routine labs were taken
at that visit which showed a hematocrit of 22 and the patient
was admitted to [**Hospital **] hospital for further evaluation.  The
patient was at Noorwood for 7 days.  On admission, INR was 1.9.
He recieved a total of 7 units of blood as well was albumin but
continued to pass black stools. EGD was notable for previously
documented gastropathy. U/S documented am ill-defined hypoechoic
mass 2.9x2.7x1.7cm which was not identified on futher CT
imaging.  Given his history and apparent progression of his
liver disease, the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.
.
Currently, the patient denies any abdominal pain, nausea or
vomiting.  He states he did vomit last night x2 with some dark
spots in the emesis.  He continues to have dark, melanic stools.
 He endorced dyspnea on excertion but denies chest pain.  He has
chronic LE edema, right worse than left.  He denies any recent
illness, fevers or chills.
.
All other detailed ROS negative.

Imaging:
[**2110-6-19**] CXR: The current radiograph demonstrates severe
pulmonary edema involving the perihilar and lower lobe areas
accompanied by large pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is unremarkable. The TIPS is in expected position.
There is no pneumothorax. The right internal jugular line tip is
at the junction of brachiocephalic vein and superior SVC.
.
[**2110-6-24**] CXR: Previously reported pulmonary edema has resolved.
Bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent basilar atelectasis
appear unchanged. Probable ascites and anasarca.
.
[**2110-6-22**] RUQ U/S: Patent TIPS with wall-to-wall flow and
appropriate directionality and velocities ranging from 51 cm/sec
proximally and to 150 cm/sec distally. These are baseline
velocities.
.
[**2110-6-25**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior/infero-lateral
hypokinesis. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**11-27**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs
of tamponade.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2109-8-14**], no
change.

Brief Hospital Course:
# GIB: UGIB is secondary to known underlying portal hypertensive
gastropathy. Pt initially received multiple blood transfusions
to maintein his Hct. Pt was started on IV pantoprazole, an
octreotide drip, and SBP prophyllaxis with ciprofloxacin. Pt
underwent TIPS placement on [**2110-6-18**] without complication.
Endoscopy was performed [**2110-6-20**] revealing no evidence of
esophageal varices or gastric varices, or actively bleeding
lesions. Portal gastropathy re-visualized. After endoscopy pt
maintained a stable Hct.  With TIPS in place, nadalol
prophyllaxis was not required. Pt continued to experience black
tarry stools throughout hospitalization. Recommend pt undergo
nonemergent colonoscopy as outpatient to assess possiblity of
LGIB.
.
# NASH cirrhosis: Known hx of liver disease, likely NASH.
Synthetic function impaired with thrombocytopenia, elevated INR,
and relatively normal albumin.  Pt experienced encephalopathy
during the admission and was successfully treated with lactulose
30mL TID.  RUQ U/S was performed [**2110-6-22**] that confirmed the
patency of TIPS.
.
# Hyperbilirubinemia:  Pt presented with jaundice that
progressed during hospitalization.  Hyperbilirubinemia
presumably from liver failure. Increased indirect bilirubin on
further examination suggests multiple pRBC transfusions may have
contributed.  RUQ U/S rules out TIPS obstruction as etiology.
Bilirubin appears to be leveling off at time of discharge.  Will
expect decrease in bilirubin within days.  Bilirubin to be
followed as outpatient.
.
# Pulmonary edema: After receiving large volumes of fluid and
transfusions of pRBCs for volume resuscitation pt experienced
episodic low oxygen saturations.  Pt was intermittently on
supplementaly oxygen (1-3L NC) to maintain SpO2 > 90% during
hospitalization.  Pt was treated with IV lasix which greatly
improved oxygen saturations and eliminated evidence of pulmonary
edema on chest x-ray. Pt was stable >48hr off supplemental
oxygen at time of discharge.
.
# DMt2: non-insulin dependent. Pt is on Glipizide as outpatient
but was held as inpatient.  Pt was placed on sliding scale
insulin.  Pt can return to home regimen on discharge.
.
# Hypothyroid: Pt continued on levothyroxine.
