Studies:
[**2126-12-23**] CXR AP: Cardiomegaly. Interval development of bilateral
interstitial opacities as well as bilateral pleural effusions,
the findings are suggestive of interstitial edema.

[**2126-12-25**] CT CHEST/ABD/PELV:
1. Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar
atelectasis. No evidence for pneumonia.
2. Diffuse ground-glass opacity with intralobular septal
thickening
suggestive of volume overload; however, other entities including
PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/or drug reaction can provide a similar picture.
3. No retroperitoneal hematoma. Resolution of previously noted
bilateral
groin hematomas.
4. Diffuse anasarca.
5. Extensive coronary artery calcification. Extensive
calcification of the
abdominal aorta and its branches.
6. Atrophic kidneys.
7. Femoral access catheter traversing through the IVC and
terminating in the right atrium.
8. Moderate hiatal hernia.
9. Extensive degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine
with old
compression deformities at L4 and T9-T10.
10. Hyperdense material at the site of insertion of the right
femoral catheter concerning for skin breakdown.

[**2126-12-26**] RUE Duplex: 1. Large pseudoaneurysm just proximal to
the right antecubital fossa. 2. No right upper extremity DVT.

[**2126-12-31**] CTA RUE:
1. Large patent pseudoaneurysm arising from the brachial artery
at the
antecubital fossa.
2. Thrombus\poor opacification of the proximal and mid brachial
artery with normal distal filling of the brachial, radial and
cubital arteries.
3. Occluded kinked right subclavian vein stent.
4. Widespread atherosclerosis.
5. Bilateral kidney atrophy with multiple hypodensities, likely
cysts,
incompletely evaluated.
6. Large hiatal hernia.
7. Right pleural effusion and atelectasis.
8. Diffuse soft tissue edema, more marked in the right anterior
chest wall.
9. Dilatation of the common bile duct with no visible
obstruction.


Brief Hospital Course:
1)Respiratory distress:  He initially presented with respiratory
distress which was most likely due to combination of dietary
indescretions and having to go an extra day without dialysis
over the weekend.  He was initially admitted to the MICU but his
symptoms resolved quickly with dialysis.  He had a CT of his
chest which did not show any evidence of pneumonia.  He ruled
out for influenza with a nasal aspirate.  He was transferred to
the floor where he remained stable from a respiratory standpoint
until 2 weeks into his course when he developed hypoxia and
respiratory alkalosis due to over medication with morphine.  His
antibiotic coverage was expanded to include levofloxacin and
flagyl because he had some abdominal pain at the time. When his
mental status recovered the next day the levofloxacin was
discontinued. The flagyl was continued given a positive CDiff
test and will be continued on discharge.

2)Coagulase negative staph bacteremia - He was found to have
coag negative staph growth on blood cultures from admission,
unclear if contaminant or if true bacteremia, however given h/o
multiple lines and limited options for future dialysis access,
will treat with course of antibiotics for bactermia for two
weeks.  All surveillance cultures since starting vanc have been
negative.  He did have Lspine MRI last admission with concern
for L3/4 abnormality which could be c/w infection.
He was treated with vancomycin for a 2 week course.  In
addition, he was started on vancomycin locks to his HD line.  He
had a repeat MRI L spine which showed no change.

3)Right brachial pseudoaneurysm: Durin his admission he was
found to have a right brachial a
