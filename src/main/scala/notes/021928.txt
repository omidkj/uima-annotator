Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**]
Chief Complaint:
Pleuritic chest pain, pneumonia, hypotension to the 80s systolic


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 53 year old male with PMH of polysubstance abuse, HIV
diagnosed in [**2137**] with last CD4 count of 434, HIV neuropathy on
fentanyl and oral Dilaudid for pain control, and hepatitis C
presenting with one week of worsening pleuritic CP and continued
fevers despite completing a 5 day course of Levaquin for
pneumonia.  He is being admitted to the MICU for asymptomatic
hypotension to the 80s systolic.  Of note, the patient was
discharged from the [**Hospital1 756**] on [**6-22**] where he was admitted for
pneumonia and pleuritic chest pain.  He was noted to have
asymptomatic hypotension to the 90s systolic during that
admission.  He reports that his chest pain was worsening and he
has been having fevers up to 103 over the last 2 days despite
completing his antibiotics course.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T=98.5, HR=91, BP=101/59, RR=18,
POx=100%on RA. A CXR was performed which showed evidence of a
RML PNA.  Blood and urine cultures were sent.  Initial labs were
unrevealing with a WBC count of 6.3, normal chemistry panel, and
a lactate of 0.6.  Ambulatory sats on room air were within
normal limits.  Given his recent failure of Levaquin, vanco,
Zosyn, and azithromycin were administered in the ED.  He was to
be admitted to the floor, but was found to have asymptomatic
hypotension with systolics in the 80s.  He got 5L of IVFs which
raised his blood pressure to 91/65.  No central line or pressors
were initiated.  Of note, the patient was found to have 2
patches of fentanyl on and was also given 4mg of PO Dilaudid.
His fentanyl patches were removed prior to transfer to the MICU.
 A repeat CXR showed that his pneumonia was blossoming with
hydration.  His vital signs on transfer was afebrile,
HR=60s-70s, BP=91/65, RR=20, 93-94% on RA.
.
On the floor, the patient appears well.  He states that the
pleuritic chest pain started on [**6-16**] and he currently feels
a stabbing pain on the right side of his chest when he takes
deep breaths.  He believes that the fevers and chills started
along with the chest pain and he continues to have fevers up to
103 at home despite completing a 5 day Levaquin course.  He
remembers having pneumonia 3-4 times in the past requiring 2
week courses of antibiotics each time.  Currently he reports
having a mild cough productive of thick greenish-yellow sputum.
He is written for fentanyl 100mcg patch to be changed daily and
admits that he has been using 2 patches daily due to his
increased pain.  Despite having blood pressures as low as the
70s while speaking with me, he denies any symptoms of
lightheadedness or dizziness.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 53 year old male with PMH of polysubstance abuse, HIV
diagnosed in [**2137**] with last CD4 count of 434, HIV neuropathy on
fentanyl and oral Dilaudid for pain control, and hepatitis C
presenting with one week of worsening pleuritic CP, continued
fevers despite completing a 5 day course of Levaquin for
pneumonia, and asymptomatic hypotension to the 80s systolic.

#.  Hypotension. The patient was asymptomatic with systolic
blood pressures as low as 70s systolic.  He received a total of
5 Liters of IVFs in the ED with resultant BPs in the 90s. Most
likely etiology was thought to be from polypharmacy with
fentanyl patch, Dilaudid, Xanax, and Ambien CR. Medications were
restarted slowly back to his home regimen with SBP >100 for the
remainder of his stay.

#.  Pneumonia.  He completed a 5 day course of Levaquin but
reported continued fevers to 102 and clear to yellowish sputum
production. He was afebrile without leukocytosis throughout his
hospital course. Induced sputum culture was contaminated but PCP
was negative. Patient was followed for 48 hours off of
antibiotics and remained afebrile. His pleuritic pain slowly
improved, although was still present at the time of discharge,
likely resulting from his previously treated pneumonia.

#.  HIV.  His last CD4 count was 434 at the [**Hospital1 756**] and his
viral load was pending at time of discharge. He was continued on
his home Atripla.

#.  Chronic pain.  The patient was initially treated with
Ibuprofen, then after hypotension resolved, restarted on his
home pain regimen of fentanyl patch and oral dilaudid with good
control of his pain.

#. Hepatitis C.  Unknown genotype.  Never been treated in the
past.  [**Month (only) 116**] be candidate for treatment as an outpatient with
boceprivir or telaprivir in addition to interferon and ribavirin
if gentoype 1. LFTs were within normal limits.
