Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: tonsillar cancer

Reason for MICU transfer: airway comprimise

Endotracheal intubation
Tracheostomy
Bronchoscopy
Bilateral chest tube placement
Skin Biopsy (R dorsum of hand)
Hemodialysis line placement
G-tube placement

History of Present Illness:
51yo male with stage IV tonsillar cancer who recently initiated
chemotherapy with docetaxel/displatin/5-FU, admitted to an OSH
with failure to thrive, transferred here because of potential
for airway compromise.

Presented for chemo [**2124-3-7**] with dehydration and dizziness,
found to have acute renal failure (Cr 2.0). He had been unable
to eat or drink due to throat pain. Hospital stay complicated by
Afib with RVR managed with a dilt drip, and he was started on
coumadin. He had pancytopenia, thought to be multifactorial. His
thrombocytopenia may be from HIT, so he was switched to Arixtra
(fondaparinox). He did not get blood transfusion prior to
transfer. His renal failure worsened, to Cr 5.0, thought to be
ATN. He began having hemoptysis and was seen by ENT, who felt he
needed a tracheostomy, but did not feel comfortable doing it
given his comorbidities. He was being for placement of a G-tube.
He was evaluated by ENT [**2124-3-10**], who . [**2124-3-16**] he was found to
have bilateral infiltrates on CXR, and was started on
vanc/Zosyn. He also had positive blood cultures for gram
positive cocci. He had a worsening respiratory status today
requiring a non-rebreather, with which is O2 improved and he was
thought stable. There was concern for his ability to protect his
airway, so he was transferred here by [**Location (un) **].

On arrival to the MICU, patient was responsive, following
commands and complained RUQ pain. His respiratory status
worsened with development of stridor, so anesthesia was called.
Labs notable for hyponatremia to 132, Cr 4.8 (per d/c summary
peak 5.0), BUN 111, WBC 3.4 with N73 and 15% bands, Hct 24.0 and
Plts 10. INR 2.1 (from 2.1), fibrinogen 738. Albumin 1.6, though
gas reassuring 7.36/39/97. Patient transiently hypotensive with
SBPs to 80. Intubated for airway protection.

Patient unable to provide ROS. Per his brother, he drank
heavily, roughly 12-pack of beer per day, up until about 3 weeks
ago. He has not had signs of withdrawal. He was having a lot of
trouble eating and would have prolonged coughing spells after
trying to have even a milkshake.

Past Medical History:
- Stage IVb squamous cell carcinoma of the left tonsil, s/p
first round of chemo with docetaxel/cisplatin/5-FU
- DVT in [**2091**] s/p 3 months of anticoagulation
- alcohol abuse
- tobacco abuse
- s/p right shoulder arthoscopy


Social History:
He smokes 1.5ppd since [**29**], quit 3 weeks ago. Heavy alcoholic
(12-pack beer per day), but has not drunk x2-3 weeks. Single,
lives alone, and is disabled. His brother has been identified as
his HCP.

Family History:
Father died at 61 of CHF. Mother died at 73, but was apparently
in good health. He has 3 brothers and two sons who are
apparently healthy. No h/o tonsillar cancer.

IMAGING:
-[**4-12**] CT chest:
FINDINGS:  Right thoracostomy tube and left pigtail catheter
have been removed.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions
persist, with several internal locules of air.

Tracheostomy tube terminates in the proximal trachea, with
surrounding retained secretions.  There has been slight overall
increase in multifocal ground-glass and consolidative opacities,
demsontrating a peribronchovascular distribution.  Lower lobe
consolidation persists, with multiple areas of cavitation and
varicoid bronchiectasis.

Diffuse intrathoracic lymphadenopathy has slightly increased,
measuring up to 2.6 x 1.9 cm in the mid right paratracheal
region, previously 2.3 x 1.7 cm; 12 mm in the right hilum,
previously 11 mm;  and 9 mm in the paraaortic region, previously
8 mm.

Left PICC again terminates in the high right atrium, and a left
internal jugular dialysis catheter ends in the lower SVC.
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There is a small
pericardial effusion. Incidental note is made of a bovine aortic
arch.  There are moderate calcifications in the thoracic aorta
and coronary arteries.  Relative hypoattenuation of the blood
pool is compatible with anemia.

Examination is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic ev
