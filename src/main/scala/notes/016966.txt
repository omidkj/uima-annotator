Brief Hospital Course:
As above, pt presented to [**Hospital1 18**] from a long-term care facility
with c/o RUQ pain on [**2191-2-14**].  Recent history of cholangitis.
Pt afebrile and stable.  Pt admitted to surgery service.  Pt on
chronic coumadin dose for Hx of DVT/PE- started on heparin drip
at [**Hospital1 18**].  PTT would be followed and heparin dose adjusted to
achieve PTT between 50 and 70.  Pt scheduled for cholecystectomy
and pre-op completed accordingly.  Pt underwent open
cholecystectomy on [**2191-2-16**].  Pt tolerated procedure well.  After
recovery in the [**Name (NI) 13042**], pt was transferreed to the floor in stable
condition.  Pain control would be managed in partnership with
the pain service.  On POD 2, pt was transferred to the SICU
after being found unresponsive, secondary to over-sedation with
narcotics.  She was administered Narcan, narcotics were held,
and she quickly regained concsiousness.  Neurology was consulted
to rule-out an intracranial process.  A CT scan was obtained
which revealed no abnormal findings and she was ruled-out for an
intracranial process. She would remain on a narcan drip in the
SICU.  She was transferred back to the floor on POD 3 in stable
condition on a low-dose morphine PCA for pain control.  She
continued to remain stable.  She began passin flatus and her
diet was advanced to regular on POD 4, which she tolerated well.
 She was transferred back to her long-term care facility in good
condition on POD 7.  She will continue to require a heparin drip
until her INR is within therapeutic range.  She also will remain
on a low-dose morphine PCA for chronic pain relief.
