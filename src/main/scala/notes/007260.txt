History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with a recent hospitalization for
healthcare-associated pneumonia ([**Date range (1) 79563**]) who presented to the
ED this morning with palpitations and SOB. Per her grand
daughter who lives with her, Mrs. [**Known lastname 4020**] was in her usual
state of health until this morning when she asked her
granddaughter to feel her chest as she felt her heart was
beating very quickly and she was short of breath.
.
The patient had been feeling fine as as of last night and went
to Church yesterday which requires her to walk up 17 steps which
she did without too much difficulty though she had some left leg
weakness which is her baseline. In the ED, initial VS were: 98.8
108 184/80 40 98% 15L NRB. CXR showed a large right sided
infiltrate. She was given levofloxacin and was ordered to
receive vancomycin and metronidazole. Diphendydramine was being
given prior to vancomycin due to history of vancomycin allergy,
and this pretreatment has been successful in the past. Her RR
remained in the 40s, so she was intubated. There was transient
hypotension to SBP 70s-80s prior to intubation, which resolved
with IVF. Another transient dip occurred when starting fentanyl
and on the way out of the ED he pressure dropped again to the
80's and she was started on levophed. She is on
fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and current VS are: T 101 (given
650mg APAP PR) BP 126/60 HR 112 RR 16 O2 100% on CMV Vt 450 with
PEEP 5. She has 2 PIVs for access.
.
Review of OMR shows that she recently had her furosemide dose
increased in the setting of [**Known lastname 9140**] LE edema. She was also
given TMP-SMX to use if she developed increased LE skin
breakdown or infection, but it is not clear if this was taken.
In addition to recent PNA hospitalization, she also was recently
hospitalized for cellulitis.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient is intubated therefore unable to
give history. However she is awake and denies pain.

MICRO:
[**10-23**] BCx: Final No Growth
[**10-23**] UCx: No Growth
[**10-23**] ULegionella: Negative
[**10-24**] Sputum: GRAM STAIN (Final [**2141-10-24**]): >25 PMNs and <10
epithelial cells/100X field. NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
[**10-26**] RESPIRATORY CULTURE: NO GROWTH.
.
[**10-23**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation. Left axis deviation. Possible
left anterior fascicular block. Intraventricular conduction
delay. Non-specific ST-T wave changes in the high lateral leads.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2141-7-19**] the findings are
similar.
.
[**10-23**] CXR: Interval development extensive right mid and lower
lung consolidations, compatible with right middle and lower lobe
pneumonia. Possible additional consolidation is seen at the left
base. Hiatal hernia.
.
[**10-23**] CXR: 1. Slight improvement in airspace consolidation
within the right lung, sparing extreme right apex and right
base, and likely due to pneumonia. 2. Resolution of interstitial
edema.
.
[**10-25**] CXR:  Large right mid lung consolidation has improved.
Left retrocardiac opacities are unchanged. Moderate right
pleural effusion is probably unchanged allowing the difference
in positioning of the patient. Left pleural effusion is small.
Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. ET tube is in a
standard position.  NG tube tip is out view below the diaphragm.
Right IJ catheter remains in place.
.
[**10-27**] CXR: 1. CHF with interstitial edema, right greater than
left pleural effusions, and underlying collapse and/or
consolidation. Possibility of underlying pneumonic infiltrate
cannot be excluded. Allowing for technical differences, no
definite change in the degree of consolidation c/w [**2141-10-25**]. 2.
Gas over cardiac silhouette may represent a hiatal hernia.
.
[**10-30**] CXR PA & Lat: In comparison with the study of [**10-27**], there
is again substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
bilateral pleural effusions, more prominent on the right, and
basilar compressive atelectasis. Central catheter remains in
place. Evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure is again
noted. The possibility of supervening pneumonia can certainly
not be excluded.
.
[**2141-11-1**] transthoracic echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly
dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is
likely related to high cardiac output. Mild to moderate ([**1-14**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Severe pulmonary hypertension (TR gradient + RA
pressure). Moderate right ventricular dilation and mild global
hypokinesis. Concentric left ventricular hypertro
