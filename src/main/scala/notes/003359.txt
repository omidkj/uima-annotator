Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 53626**]
Chief Complaint:
rectal bleeding

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EUA, rigid sigmoidoscopy, ligation of bleeding hemorrhoids

History of Present Illness:
60F w/ history of MGUS, COPD, HCV cirrhosis, iron deficiency
anemia and previous admissions for GI bleed now being admitted
to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for presumed lower gi bleed.
Somewhat of vague historian but pt reports 4-5 episodes of
bright red per rectum x 2 days. Denies melena. Also reports
persistent nausea and non-bilious, non-bloody emesis. Reports
metallic taste. Subjective fevers and chills. Has history of
hemorrhoids and constipation that has been treated successfully
with magnesium oxide. Not clear that she has experienced more
constipation over the last several days preceding her bleeding
from rectum. She has experienced some rectal pain which she
attributes to hemorrhoids - this has now resolved. Good appetite
but decreased po's for unclear reasons. Denies chest pain but
reports dyspnea on exertion over the last several days. No
cough. Reports light headed when standing.
Of note, pt was hospitalized on 2 occasions in [**2166-2-12**] for
bright red blood per rectum. Work-up included EGD which
demonstrated duodenal angioectasias, Schatski's ring and
duodenitis and portal gastropathy. A colonoscopy had been
performed which was significant for large internal hemorrhoids
without stigmata of recent bleedng. She did have a colonoscopy
in [**1-16**] which demonstrated sigmoid diverticulosis. She required
red cell transfusions on both admissions. It was felt that her
bleeding was most likely related to hemorrhoidal bleeding and
she had been advised to follow up with surgery.
In ed, noted to be afebrile and hemodymically stable. She was
found to be orthostatic however and crit was 23 and then 19 on
recheck. She was guiac positive on rectal exam. NG lavage was
negative. She received 1 unit prbc, Protonix 40, and benadryl

CXR [**2166-6-6**]
IMPRESSION: Mild congestive heart failure with new small right
pleural effusion and bibasilar atelectasis.
.
CT [**6-6**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of free intraperitoneal air, drainable fluid
collections, or regions of inflammation in the abdomen or
pelvis.
2. Small amount of ascites, small amount of free fluid in the
pelvis, bilateral pleural effusions, and subcutaneous edema are
consistent with aggressive volume resuscitation.
3. Consolidation at both lung bases, likely related to
compressive atelectasis.
4. Diffusely low attenuation liver is consistent with fatty
infiltration.

.
[**6-10**] CXR
IMPRESSION: Decreasing right lung base atelectasis and smaller
right pleural effusion


Brief Hospital Course:
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient received an additional 1unit FFP, and 2
units PRBC (last [**6-4**] at 2 p.m.) with HCT 22,8 -> 24.6. She had
a 16 beat run of NSVT, asymptomatic. She was evaluated by
gastroenterology, who noted 2 large lacerated external
hemorrhoids oozing on rectal exam. Surgery was consulted, and
she underwent an EUA, rigid sigmoidoscopy, and ligation of
bleeding internal hemorrhoids on [**2166-6-4**]. Following the
procedure, she was observed overnight in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. This morning,
she had a large BM (brown with scan amount of blood) in which
the surgical packing was expelled.
.
Floor course:
# Lower GI bleed: This was most likely related to hemorrhoids,
for which the patient underwentligation [**2166-6-4**]. She does have
multiple other possible sources of UGI bleeding (portal
gastropathy, duodenitis, and duodenal ectasias), however, these
are unlikely contributors to current presentation, given (-) NG
lavage in ED. She was transfused 1 unit PRBC on [**6-5**] with good
response in hematocrit to 30. She was continued on PPI [**Hospital1 **] given
portal gastropathy and continued on low dose propranolol
(started in the ICU for portal hypertension). The patient was
followed by the GI service throughout her hospital stay, who
recommended high fiber diet, stool softners, and [**Last Name (un) **] baths [**2-14**]
times daily as needed. Her hematocrit will need to be monitored
closely as an outpatient to ensure stability.
.
# Blood loss anemia: The patients hematocrit, which was 19 on
admission, was due to GI bleeding superimposed on chronic iron
deficiency (baseline HCT high 20s). She was continued on iron
therapy and, as mentioned above, received a total of 3 units
PRBC (last [**2166-6-5**]) with stabilization of hematocrit.
.
# LLQ/RLQ abdominal tenderness: Following transfer to the
general medical floor, the patient developed deep LLQ and RLQ
tenderness with voluntary guarding on [**6-6**]. Given concern for
possible perforation (recent hemorrhoidal ligation),
inflammatory process/abscess, or biliary obstruction (as Tbili
was 2.1, elevated from baseline), a CT abd/pelvis was obtained
[**6-6**] which showed.... Surgery was consulted, who felt that
surgical complication/perforation was unlikely. She was
initially kept NPO with IVF, but her diet was then advanced. At
time of discharge, she is tolerating a regular, high fiber diet.
.
# Bacteremia - Course was complicated by E.coli bacteremia,
treated initially with levofloxacin.  However, the patient
became delerious one evening and a code purple was called. All
narcotics were stopped and levofloxacin was changed to
ceftriaxone as the former can cause mental status changes in
patients.  She was discharged on cefpodoxime, with a total
course of 14 days from positive blood cultures.
.
# Fever - On the day prior to discharge, the patient had a low
grade fever.  Workup included CXR and UA/Urine culture, all of
which were negative.  Fever resolved and the patient was
discharged on a total of 14 days of antibiotics starting from
day of positive blood cultures for E.coli bacteremia.
.
# Altered mental status - Occurred 2 nights prior to discharge,
and acutely resolved with removal of sedating meds and changing
levoflox
