History of Present Illness:
41 y/o F w/past med hx of recently diagnosed HTN, who went to
the [**Hospital3 3765**] ED last night with nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea.  Her illness began 6 weeks ago with only watery,
non-bloody diarrhea (7-8x/day).  She attributed this to stress
as she's been going through a divorce.  However, 9 days ago (on
[**5-8**]), she began to feel worse, with generalized body aches,
chills, sweats and a cough.  She saw her PCP who felt she had
bronchitis and gave her Zithromax.  This was on [**2123-5-10**].  She
took the Zithromax that night and the next morning, and
subsequently developed nausea and vomiting 4-5x/day (and
diarrhea continued).  She went to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**5-11**], and
she was tachycardic at 120, febrile to 100.5.  They felt she had
gastroenteritis.  At that time, her WBC count was 10, AST 163,
ALT 116, and K 2.6.  Her BUN was 7, creatinine 1.0, bicarb 19.
She was given IV fluid, Reglan, and was discharged home on
Levaquin 250 mg daily and Potassium 20 meq daily.  All of last
week, she continued to feel poorly with continued nausea,
vomiting, fevers, chills, and vague abdominal pain.  She also
had some low back pain and for this took 12 tablets of
Ibuprofen/day for 4-5 days.  She also c/o left knee pain and a
lower extremity rash.  On Friday she went to [**Location (un) 6408**]for
work, and came back last night.  Upon returning home, she went
immediately back to the Emergency Room as she still felt
terrible.

At [**Hospital3 3765**], she was noted to have acute renal failure
with a BUN 36, creatinine 7.6, AST 1500, ALT 800, (nl bili), pH
7.22, bicarb 18, ESR 55, WBC 1.9 with 81% polys, hgb 10.4.
Urine sediment examined by physician at [**Name9 (PRE) **] (who is also a
renal fellow) demonstrated many WBCs, many RBCs, many squamous
epithelial cells, many renal tubular epithelial cells, many
coarse granular casts, and no red cell casts.  She had a stool
culture from [**5-11**] which grew abundant Staph and did not grow
normal gram negative enteric flora.  O&P neg, stool cx neg for
salmonella, campylobacter, shigella, or EColi O157:H7.  They
felt she had ATN due to NSAIDs as well as a necroinflammatory
hepatitis, and transferred her to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.

On further review of systems, she denies recent travel to
anywhere other than the recent trip to [**Location (un) **].  She
denies any sick contacts, IVDU, tattoos, or eating anything out
