Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7733**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, pleural effusion, sternal wound dihescience s/p sternectomy
and CABG

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
thoracentesis
Sternal wound debridement and latissmus dorsi flap closure


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 73M male with h/o DMII, CAD s/p MI [**2167**] s/p 4-vessel CABG
complicated by fracture of sternal wires and wound dehiscence.
Recently was discharged from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] service here at [**Hospital1 18**]
on [**6-30**] after 10 day hospital stay. WAs discharged to [**Hospital 38**]
rehab with vac dressing over chest wound. Pt tx'ed to S. [**Hospital **]
Hosp on [**2180-7-5**] for SOB, fever to 101.9, HR 119,  and found to
have large left pleural effusion s/p CT guided thoracentesis
with 1200 cc removed and pt's resp status is markedly improved
however his wound appears worrisome to them. Sating 93-96% on
RA.
.
Here prior hospitalization was notable for the following:
.
CAD/CHF. [**2180-5-1**] with chest and arm pain and found to have non-Q
MI. Transferred to Eastern [**State 1727**] MC on [**2180-5-2**] for cath, which
showed multi-vessel disease. On [**5-3**] he had a CABGx4. Post-op
course was complicated by respiratory failure and fluid
overload. He also had paroxysmal afib for which amiodarone and
coumadin were started. He later developed L hand weakness and
was felt to have had a R MCA ischemic stroke by neurology. Sx
improved, and he was admitted to acute rehab at EMMC on [**2180-5-11**].

.
Sternotomy Wound Dehiscence.
On [**5-13**] he was readmitted to medicine service after fracture of
his sternal wires and sternal incision dehiscence. He underwent
rewiring and debridement but continued to have serous drainage
from the mid-portion of his wound. On [**2180-5-19**] he underwent
sternal wound debridement and b/l pectoralis major flaps. On [**5-24**]
he was started on cefuroxime for L-sided infiltrate and
bronchospasm. On [**6-14**] he had another debridement and removal of
several sternal wires.
.
Stroke: On [**5-28**] he developed L hand weakness and L facial droop
was felt to have had a R MCA ischemic stroke by neurology (CT
negative at that time); started on aggrenox. Carotid U/S nl on
L, incomplete study on R. TEE with PFO with R to L shunting,
concentric LVH, mod TR. LE dopplers with no DVT.
.
Per D/C summary at [**Hospital1 34**], patient noted to be anemic and was
transfused 1 T PRBC, Cr 1.2-->2.0; due to changing Cr, lovenox
was switched to Hep gtts.

.
Rads at OSH: CT with Contrast: C/W SXternal Dehiscence with
surgical packing. no pneumomediastinum but 1.3cm of SQ gas at
prox edge. lg Left effusion.
.
ETT: [**5-23**]: in [**State 1727**]: EF 70%, concentric left vent hypertrophy.
.
[**7-10**] CXR: 1. Large midsternal lucency corresponding to known
open sternal wound in this patient with history of sternal
dehiscence.
2. Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion, probably slightly
increased in size in the interval. It is difficult to exclude
underlying pneumonia in the lingula or left lower lobe.
.
TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. Right ventricular systolic function appears depressed.
The aortic root is moderately dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are/present
but cannot be quantified. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**7-13**] CXR: 1. Residual small left pleural effusion, without
pneumothorax.
2. New small right pleural effusion.
