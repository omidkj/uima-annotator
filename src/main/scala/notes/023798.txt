Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2290**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
63 year old male w/ PMH notable for mitral valve prolapse s/p
mitral annuloplasty [**2198**], MS (on echo from [**2200**]), c/b RV
dysfunction, dCHF, and Parkinson's disease who presents for
abdominal pain and exertional DOE.

Patient states that over the past few days he has been
experiencing mid-epigastric abdominal pain as well as DOE. He
finds himself unable to complete an entire sentence, baseline
can walk [**12-19**] mile now reduced.  He also c/o feeling like his
"legs were giving out," with difficulty raising his head.  About
3 weeks ago patient had URI sx w/ congestion and mildly
productive cough, that linger but have improved.  He denies
fevers.  He has chronic constipation and took an enema this AM
which helped his abdominal discomfort.  He also endorses
occasional sternal chest pressure, not associated w/ shortness
of breath, diaphoresis, and non-radiating.  He denies
palpitations, melena, BRBPR, hematuria, dysuria.  He took his
pulse ox at home (from an automatic machine given by his
sister-in-law who is a nutritionist) and was in the 88-92%.  He
called his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] told him to go to the ED.  Of note, patient
does c/o progressive shortness of breath over the past year.

In the ED, initial VS were:  BP 150/94, HR 104, RR 20, 92% RA.
He was placed on 4L nc w/ O2 sats 93-95%.  His ECG was notable
for sinus tach 104bpm, twi v1, tw flat v2.  His labs were
notable for BUN/cr 26/1, trop < 0.01, Na 143, K 4.1, bicarb 30,
BNP 1311, wbc 11.8, hct 37.1, plt 330, inr 1.2, ddimer 213, abg
7.47/32/66.  CXR suggestive of pulmonary vascualr congestion.
Cardiology was consulted.  He received asa, ipratropium,
albuterol, lasix 20mg iv, clonazepam, sinemet.

On arrival to the MICU, patient feels overall better.

CXR:
Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
exam from [**2201-11-27**]. There is no confluent
consolidation. There is,
however, indistinct pulmonary vascular marking seen throughout.
There is
blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggestive of small
pleural effusion.
Right costophrenic angle is sharp. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is
stable. Bilateral deep brain stimulator devices project over the
chest.
Median sternotomy wires are also noted. Osseous and soft tissue
structures
are otherwise notable for hypertrophic changes in the spine.
IMPRESSION: Findings suggestive of pulmonary vascular
congestion.

[**2204-3-2**]:
ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. The gradient
across the mitral valve is increased (mean = 7 mmHg). No mitral
regurgitation is seen (does not exclude due to acoustic
shadowing). Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Well seated mitral
annuloplasty ring but with increased gradient. Pulmonary artery
hypertension. Right ventricular cavity dilation with free wall
hypokinesis. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Normal left
ventricular cavity size with preserved global systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2201-11-20**], the
findings are similar.

[**2204-3-2**] Urine culture: negative

Brief Hospital Course:
63 year old male w/ PMH notable for mitral valve prolapse s/p
MVR and annuloplasty, mitral stenosis, c/b RV dysfunction, dCHF,
and Parkinson's disease who presents for dyspnea and abdominal
discomfort.  Dyspnea due to acute on chronic dCHF from dietary
indiscretion.

# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: Admission exam
notable for crackles and CXR w/ pulm congestion. Patient takes
lasix regularly 20mg PO daily to [**Hospital1 **].  Acute heart failure
likely caused by recent increased sodium intake and URI. CE were
negative x2 and ECG w/o ST changes, making ischemia highly
unlikely.  Pa
