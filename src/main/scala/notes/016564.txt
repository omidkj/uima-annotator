Brief Hospital Course:
BY PROBLEM:

1) Fever: Mult potential sources identified. Pt was
re-pancultured on admission and started on broad coverage due to
mental status changes with ceftriaxone, vanco and PO flagyl for
possible c.diff infection. Ct head showed no evidence of a mass
lesion. CT chest showed evidence of consolidation in LLL
suggestive of infiltrate. Bronchoscopy was performed and there
was no evidence of post-obstructive pna. It was felt that pt may
be due to constant aspiration. Pt was not inflating cuff for
eating as she did not like inability to speak. Pt was then seen
by our speech and swallow service for evaluation for Passy-Muir
valve. Recommended pt wear valve for parts of day to allow for
better cough and clearance of secreations. Pt can also use with
eating.
After hospital day #1 and all cx's neg, pt taken off all abx and
any meds that can potentially cause fevers. Pt was afebrile for
remainder of admission. Fevers thought to be [**3-13**] drug reactions.
After fevers resolved pts mental status returned to [**Month/Day (2) 5348**].
- No vent changes were made other than valve change
- Bronch revealed aspiration.
- No fevers after d/c'd unnecessary meds, abx and valve changed.


2) MS changes: as mentioned above, thought to be [**3-13**] fevers.
When fevers resolved, MS returned to [**Month/Day (2) 5348**].

3) Sacral decub: stage 2-3. Applied wet to dry dressing [**Hospital1 **] and
rotated frequently to avoid complression.

4) DM2: while in hosptial d/c'd metformin as possible drug
reaction. Covered with insulin slidine scale.

5) FEN: diabetic diet. Repleted lytes as needed.

MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5348**].
