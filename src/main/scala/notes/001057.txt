Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
increasing weakness and shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
placement and removal of right internal jugular central venous
catheter


History of Present Illness:
76 y/o male with ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 15%, severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], restrictive lung disease, and smoldering multiple myeloma
who presented to the ED on [**2128-9-16**] with weakness. He was
initially admitted to the meidicine floor but was transferred to
the MICU for closer monitoring. He does have baseline shortness
of breath but this has worsened over the past couple of days,
especially with exertion. The farthest he can walk is his
bathroom without getting dyspneic and he cannot go up stairs at
home. He denies orthopnea and PND and does not report ankle
swelling. He feels albuterol helps his breathing but he has not
noted wheezing. In the past 4-5 days, he has not been taking
most of his medications because he ran out.
.
In terms of his weight loss, he reports going from 235lbs ->
175lbs in the last four months. He feels bloated when he eats
("like when you drink a lot of water.") There have been no new
changes in his medications, just that he ran out of several of
them recently. He does not admit to dietary indiscretion.
.
[**Date Range **]: Denies recent F/C. Denies CP. Admits to baseline DOE
(cannot walk up his 14 steps at home without having SOB). Denies
melena or hematochezia. Positive for weight loss. Denies cough.
Denies orthopnea or PND. Denies significant increase in LE
edema. No abdominal pain or diarrhea.

.
Lower extremity U/S:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis,
bilaterally.
.
CXR:
1. Right basal opacity likely representing atelectasis; however,
pneumonia cannot be excluded.
2. Cardiomegaly, unchanged.
3. Chronic pulmonary changes, grossly unchanged.

ECHO:, [**9-17**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF=15-20%). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right
ventricular cavity is markedly dilated. There is moderate global
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation
is seen with a regurgitant volume of 45 cc/beat. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial

effusion.

IMPRESSION: Biventricular dilatation with severe global
biventricular systolic dysfunction. Moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
.
[**9-16**] CT abd/pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. In this limited study, there are no signs of advanced bowel
ischemia, although ischemia cannot be ruled out on this study.

2. No evidence for pneumonia or large abdominal abscess.

3. Moderate cardiomegaly, anasarca, ascites and right pleural
effusion consistent with known congestive heart failure.

4. Progressive interstitial lung disease; the upper lobe
predominance is not typical for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
and suggests etiologies such as sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity
pneumonitis, or silicosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 y/o male with dilated cardiomyopathy EF 15%, HTN, COPD, and
smoldering MM who presented with weakness and mild increase in
shortness of breath, likely representing cardiac cachexia and
decompensating failure.  The decision was made with him and his
family to make him comfort measures due to his grim prognosis.
He was very comfortable on discharge.  Still arrousable to voice
and able to state his needs.
.
# Cardiac
Ischemia: No evidence of active coronary ischemia. Dilated
cardiomyopathy, cardiac catheterization demonstrated three
vessel disease, but patient is not a candidate for surgical
revascularization based on poor myocardial viability.
.
Pump - end-stage CHF, with dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy and
severe valvular disease. Diuresed initially with lasix infusion
and then with lasix 40mg IV bid, with slight improvement in
valvular regurgitation on echo after diuresis. Discussed
invasive hemodynamic monitoring with tailored therapy as a
potential option with patient and family, but patient did not
wish invasive measures.
.
Rhythm - Sinus rhythm with PVCs
.
COPD, also restrictive lung disease post XRT:
- no real benefit at this time for nebs, but pt may use for
subjective relief
- supplemental O2 as needed
.
ARF: anuric on discharge
.
UTI: UCx negative, completed 7 days of Abx
.
smoldering myeloma: at last visit, disease as stable, no active
issues at this time
.
# Elevated LFT's: most likely [**2-27**] to right sided heart failure
and congestion
- received PO Vitamin K for elevated INR
.
# FEN: diet as tolerated,  was not taking
