Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Sulfasalazine / Salicylates

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, chest pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2170-4-13**] -  Cardiac Catheterization
[**2170-4-13**] - Emergency salvage coronary artery bypass graft x4:
Saphenous vein grafts to left anterior descending artery,
diagonal I, diagonal II and obtuse marginal arteries. Mitral
valve repair with a size 26 CG Future Ring
[**2170-4-17**] - chest closure


History of Present Illness:
This is a 74-year-old female retired psychologist with a history
of presumed coronary artery disease (no history of cardiac
catheterization, but hypokinetic mid-to-basal inferior and
inferolateral walls and distal septal wall on echocardiogram on
[**2169-12-4**]), subdural hematoma s/p left craniotomy and
evacuation on [**2169-11-24**], known infrarenal AAA, and moderate
mitral regurgitation who presents with left arm and shoulder
heaviness, shortness of breath, and headache over the last 2
weeks, worsening today. The patient initially presented to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**], where she was borderline tachycardic to the 90s and
hypotensive to the 90s sBP. It is unclear whether she was
hypoxic prior to administration of a few liters oxygen.  EKG
showed sinus rhythm with STD in V4-V6 and TWF inferiorly and
laterally; there was also submillimter STE
in aVR.  These changes were similar but more severe than the
STTW changes noted on EKG dated [**2169-11-25**].  TnT 0.657 and
BNP>[**Numeric Identifier **]. After discussion with the patient's neurosurgeon and
initiation of heparin, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

Upon evaluation at the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she remained hypotensive and
borderline tachycardic.  Physical exam notable for poor breath
sounds but R>L basilar crackles.  JVP elevated to 12cmH20.
Regular rhythm with II/VI holosystolic murmur at left sternal
border and apex.  Repeat EKG revealed improving STD in V4-V6.
CTA was performed and was negative for aortic dissection or PE,
but did show moderate-sized pleural effusions larger than prior
with the suggestion of right-heart strain.  Na 140, K 4.4,
BUN/pCr 20/1.1.  TnT here 0.68.  CT showed small left SDH and
right frontal subdural hypodense collection, slightly smaller
than prior, with no new hemorrhage.  Bedside echocardiogram
showed large pleural effusions with slightly worsening left
ventricular systolic function compared with 11/[**2169**]. She
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and was cath today which showed significant
CAD RCA, LAD and wide open ischemic MR. She was very hypotensive
and IABP was attempted but was unable to be placed. She was on
max dopa and levo added for support. She was seen by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **]
and the plan was made for her to go to the OR for emergent
CABG/MVR.

Pertinent Results:
TTE [**2170-4-28**]
There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with mid to distal anterior and apical akinesis.
Basal inferior wall is hypokinetic. Right ventricular chamber
size is normal. with borderline normal free wall function. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. A mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae.
Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2170-4-21**], a
wire is no longer seen in RA/RV. The wall motion abnormalities,
LV function, Mitral regurgitation are all similar. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressures can be estimated and are moderately
elevated.

[**2170-4-24**] CT Scan
1. Post median sternotomy, MVR, and CABG. There has been
decreased size of
the bilateral pleural effusions with basal atelectasis noted.
2. Stable left-sided pneumobilia and minimally enlarged
infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm as described.No intra
abdominal fluid collections.
3. New thrombus in the left internal jugular vein

[**2170-4-27**] Video Swallow
No gross aspiration or penetration seen.

[**2170-4-21**] Upper extremity ultrasound
1. Limited examination however no evidence of deep venous
thrombosis in the left upper extremity.
2. Ovoid hypoechoic area posterior to the left brachial artery
and veins
measuring 1.3 x 1.0 cm is incompletely evaluated. Evaluation of
this area
with dedicated ultrasound, when feasible, is recommended
