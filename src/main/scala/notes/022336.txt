ADMISSION STUDIES
-CT head: Subdural, subarachnoid, intra-parenchymal, occipital
skull fracture(non-displaced), basilar skull fracture. Repeat
head CT: slightly worse intra-parenchymal bleed.
-CT neck: negative
-CXR: rotated, low lung volumes, Pelvis: Negative
-L. Ankle films: Subtle, minimally displaced transverse lucency
of left medial malleolus consistent with avulsion fracture.
-TLS [**Year/Month/Day **]
-CT chest/abd/pelvis: no acute process

[**12-31**] ECHO Conclusions:
1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
2. The aortic root is mildly dilated.
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. There is a trivial to small pericardial effusion.

[**12-31**] MR [**First Name (Titles) 12784**] [**Last Name (Titles) **]

[**1-5**] CXR IMPRESSION:
Persistent congestive heart failure. More confluent opacities at
the bases, right greater than left, with slight worsening in
right lower lobe and slight improvement in the left lower lobe.
These findings may be due to changing distribution of dependent
edema in this patient with congestive heart failure

[**1-7**] MR head
IMPRESSION: Stable-appearing intraparenchymal, subarachnoid and
subdural hematomas without evidence of cerebral infarction

[**1-8**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. Improving CHF, with improving left lower lobe atelectasis.
2. Continued cardiomegaly with tortuous and widened thoracic
aorta

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted to SICU for further management of SDH, SAH, IPH, skull
fractures, and ankle fracture.

NEURO: Electively intubated for airway protection. Q1 hour neuro
checks were unchanged overnight, however repeat head CT after
admission demonstrated likely worsening of IPH.  Neurosurgery
elected not to do intracranial pressure monitoring and managed
him expectantly. Neurologic status remained poor throughout the
admission, despite stable repeat head CTs and minimal to no
sedation, the patient remained only intermittantly following
commands.  Speech remains a [**Last Name 12785**] problem, pt has been fit for
passe muir valve but makes no move to try to speak, will need
intense neuro rehab and speech therapy.

GI: pt failed multiple speech and swallow tests, largely likely
bc of his neuro status.  PEG tube placed, which patient
tolerated well, and tube feeds were advanced to goal without
complication.  Fup with speech and swallow for continued need
for PEG in one month or earlier per acute rehab.

PULM: Hospital course was complicated by inability to extubate
the patient at first due to s/s congestive heart failure which
resolved with diuresis, however patient still with episodes of
exhaustion on trials of CPAP therefore patient got a
tracheostomy on HD 11 which he tolerated well-- after trach,
patient maintained good ox/vent on trach mask of 8L and was
transferred to the floor for further management.  On floor pt
remained stable although requires frequent suctioning and 70%
trach mask.

ID: Course was also complicated by several febrile episodes for
which no source was identified, patient was maintained on broad
spectrum antibiotics x 10days and remained afebrile after that
point.

ORTHO: left medial malleolar avulsion fracture managed with pain
control prn and a bivalve cast at all times, patient was seen
and evaluated by Physical therapy and is to maintain a partial
weightbearing status at time of discharge.

CVS: patient with known hypertension on several BP meds,
difficult to control here requiring polypharmacy.  Renal wup
negative.  BP stable on PO meds.  Signs of CHF on CXRs and
difficulty weaning from ventilator in TSICU and from trach mask
on floor, required intermittent lasix boluses.

DISPO:  pt was stable from a neurologic and pulmonary standpoint
at time of discharge to acute rehab.
