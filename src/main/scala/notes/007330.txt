Chief Complaint:
Chest tightness

History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 81 year old male with past medical history of
hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented to [**Hospital **]
Hospital on [**2188-2-17**] with four day history of chest tightness and
shortness of breah. He reports that approx 5 days ago he started
to have chest discomfort which he attributed to "the flu." He
describes this as substernal chest pressure with no radiation
with associated severe shortness of breath, "gasping" for air
with minimal exertion on walk to mailbox. He denies diaphoresis,
no nausea or lightheadedness. He denies having these symptoms in
the past. Reports having a fever on [**2-15**] to 101.5 which
resolved. No fever. Cough productive of clear sputum. An EKG
completed upon arrival to [**Hospital **] Hospital demonstrated ST
depressions anterolaterally - leads I, V4-V6, and a troponin was
found to be 20.57, down to 18, then elevated to 22.8. BNP was
also elevated to 868. CXR showed mild vascular congestion and he
was treated with Lasix 20 mg IV overnight on [**12-13**] due to
some shortness of breath and chest pain. He put out 1100cc of
urine. Additionally, he received a loading dose of Plavix 600mg,
placed on a heparin drip, continued on atenolol, and nitropaste
applied for chest pain. At time of transfer, he was chest pain
free, in no distress, with bilaterally diminished lung sounds.
CXR completed at OSH was consistent with CHF. He was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.

Pertinent Results:
[**2188-2-18**] Cardiac Cath:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system

demonstrated a severe three vessel CAD.  The LMCA had mild
non-obstructive disease.  The LAD was completely occluded.  The
LCx was
diffusely diseased and had a 90% mid vessel stenosis and a 90%
stenosis
of the OM1.  The RCA was a tortuous vessel with a 100% mid
vessel
occlusion.  The distal RCA, as well as the LAD territory, were
supplied
by the collaterals from the acute marginal (that itself had mild

disease). RCA conus branch had a separate ostium and gave
collaterals to
the LAD as well.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated filling
pressures
with an RVDP of 22 mmHg and a mean PCWP of 30 mm Hg.  The
cardiac index
was depressed at 1.84 l/min/m2.  There was a moderate pulmonary
systolic
arterial hypertension with a PASP of 50 mm Hg.  The systemic
arterial
systolic pressure was normal at 117 mmHg.  Patient was noted to
be in
and out of atrial fibrillation during the case.
3.  Left ventriculography with a manual contrast injection
revealed an
LVEF of 20% with a global LV hypokinesis.  No significant MR was
noted.

[**2188-2-19**] Abdominal US:
1. Diffusely echogenic liver consistent with fatty infiltration.
More advanced liver disease including significant hepatic
fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.
2. Ectasia of the distal abdominal aorta measuring up to 3 cm.
One-year followup is recommended.
3. At least two simple cysts are seen within the right lobe of
the liver measuring up to 1.4 cm.
4. Right pleural effusion.

[**2188-2-20**] Transthoracic ECHO:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There is moderate
to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %)
with inferior akinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 76598**] was admitted with NSTEMI. He underwent cardiac
catheterization which revealed severe three vessel coronary
artery disease(see result section for further detail). Cardiac
surgery was consulted and additional preoperative evaluation was
performed. Carotid ultrasound was unremarkable while abdominal
ultrasound was notable for ectasia of the distal abdominal aorta
measuring up to 3 cm. Preoperative echocardiogram showed
moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
25-30 %) with inferior akinesis, trace aortic insufficiency and
only mild mitral regurgitation. He awaited Plavix washout prior
to surgery and remained pain free on a Heparin drip for
intermittent atrial fibrillation.

On [**2-25**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] performed coronary artery bypass
grafting surgery. For surgical details, please see seperate
dictated operative note. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. He was intermittently
transfused to maintain hematocrit near 30%. On postoperative day
two, he developed rapid atrial fibrillation which was initially
treated with Amiodarone and beta blockade. He otherwise
maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on
postoperative day two. Despite medical therapy, he continued to
experience paroxsymal atrial fibrillation. He was eventually
started on Warfarin with a temporary Heparin bridge. The EP
service was consulted. Cardioversions were performed on [**2-29**] and 13th without much success. He continued to experience
paroxsymal atrial fibrillation. For the remainder of his
hospital stay, Amiodarone and beta blockade were titrated
accordingly. His INR was followed very closely and dosed for a
goal INR around 2.0 - 3.0. Due to a supratherapeutic INR,
Warfarin was held for several days to allow the INR to
improve(see result section for lab values).  His renal function
remained relatively stable ranging between 1.5 to 2.1. The
remaineder of his postoperative course wa
