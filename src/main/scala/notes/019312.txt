HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 9035**] is a 44-year-old woman
with alcoholism who was transferred from an outside hospital with
a chief complaint of hypotension, acute respiratory distress
syndrome, in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis.  At the
outside hospital the patient admitted to an alcohol intake of
three glasses of wine every other day, but on further questioning
her boyfriend reports that she drinks approximately 1 liter of
wine per day for at least the several days prior to admission.

On [**2-1**], the patient experienced the onset of epigastric
pain, nausea, vomiting.  On [**2-3**] she vomited five to six
times and was unable to keep down p.o. fluids.  The patient
presented to the Emergency Room at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital.  Her
review of systems at that point was positive for chest pain and
shortness of breath.  On the morning of presentation she also
noted dyspepsia.  She denied bright red blood per rectum or
urinary complaints.  Her last menstrual period had been 10 days
prior.  She had no sexual activity in the past five months.  Her
examination at the outside hospital was notable for present bowel
sounds and periumbilical tenderness.   Her laboratories there
were notable for a white blood cell count of 11.4 with 86%
polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and a sodium of 130, and potassium
of 2.7, and an anion gap of 17.  Her AST was 101, and her amylase
was 195.  Her alcohol screen was negative.

She was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital for conservative
management of pancreatitis.  She received intravenous fluids,
potassium repletion, Demerol, and Vistaril for pain management.
Chest x-ray on admission was clear.  A CT scan of her abdomen
showed a fatty liver, diffuse enlargement of the pancreas with
areas of decreased enhancement, presenting the question of
necrosis, moderate fat surrounding, and no fluid collection.  The
patient was started on imipenem on [**2-4**].  She did
relatively well through [**2-6**].

On the morning of [**2-7**], the patient complained of
shortness of breath.  Her temperature at that point was 100
degrees Fahrenheit.  Her pulse was 161.  Her blood pressure was
144/87, and her respiratory rate was 38.  She was saturating 63%
on 2 liters.  A chest x-ray showed bilateral alveolar
infiltrates.  She was given Ativan and morphine and intravenous
Lasix.  An arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.33, PCO2 of 37,
and PO2 of 39.  She was intubated and taken to the [**Hospital3 417**]
Hospital Intensive Care Unit. The patient was given diltiazem for
sinus tachycardia, phenylephrine drip for hypotension.  Also
started on a propofol drip, calcium, and magnesium.  A central
venous catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein,
and a femoral arterial line was placed.  She had a right atrial
pressure of 19, pulmonary artery pressure of 98/31, and a
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25.  She was given an
additional 100 mg of Lasix intravenously and transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for further management.

On arrival, the patient was intubated and not responsive to
voice.  She was admitted to the MICU.

and 10.  Has a boyfriend.  Positive history of alcoholism;

history; one pack per week.  No drugs.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with diabetes.  Father with history
of coronary artery disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature of 101.2
rectally, pulse 106, respiratory rate 22, blood pressure
138/84, oxygen saturation 95% on FIO2 of 100%.  Pulmonary
artery pressure of 36/21, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
of 13, central venous pressure of 13, cardiac output of 4.96.
Systemic vascular resistance of 1258.  Ventilator setting
assist control ventilation 450 X 18, positive end-expiratory
pressure 15, FIO2 1.  The patient was intubated and sedated.
She purposefully opened eyes.  Occasional myoclonus.  No
meaningful response to verbal or tactile stimuli.  Her
conjunctivae were pink.  Her pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  She had no doll's eye reflex.  Her neck
was supple.  No jugular venous distention was appreciated.
Her heart had a regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 systolic
murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla.  She had
decreased breath sounds at the bases and in the apices
without rales or wheezes.  Her bowel sounds were absent.  Her
belly was softly distended.  The patient became agitated with
epigastric pressure.  There was no peripheral edema.  The
lower extremity pulses were dopplerable.  There was no
stigmata of chronic liver disease.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell
count of 13.4, hematocrit 32, platelets 286.  Sodium 133,
potassium 3.4, chloride 98, bicarbonate 20, blood urea
nitrogen 11, creatinine 0.8, glucose of 251.  Calcium 5.3,
magnesium 0.9, phosphorous 1.  Creatine kinase was 272, with
a MB fraction of 1.2, troponin was negative.  Arterial blood
gas on admission revealed pH of 7.33, PCO2 of 37, PO2 of 39
on FIO2 of 1.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus
tachycardia at 163 beats per minute with T wave flattening in
leads V3 through V6, III, and F.

Chest x-ray on admission revealed bilateral upper lobe
alveolar opacities consistent with pulmonary edema.
Endotracheal tube in good position, and a pulmonary artery
catheter in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery.

CT of the abdomen revealed fatty infiltration of the liver;
normal spleen, adrenals, and kidneys. Small bilateral
effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.  Diffuse enlargement of
the pancreas, moderate fatty stranding, some areas of
decreased enhancement.  No abscess or fluid collections.

Right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed ascites, no
gallstones.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 44-year-old female with
alcoholism who presented to the [**Hospital1 188**] from an outside hospital with physiology consistent
with acute respiratory distress syndrome and hypovolemic
shock secondary to third spacing from necrotizing pancreatitis.

Her Medical Intensive Care Unit course was notable for the
following:

 1.  PULMONARY:  Upon arrival the patient was intubated, and
ventilated, and paralyzed.  Paralysis was discontinued on
[**2-10**].  By [**2-15**], the ventilator was decreased to
minimal pressure support, but the patient failed a spontaneous
breathing trial.  A chest x-ray on [**2-17**] revealed a right
upper lobe infiltrate and sputum Gram stain showed gram-negative
rods.  The patient was thus started on vancomycin and gentamicin
for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia.  The patient
remained stable but was not extubated due to inability to
decrease sedation and improve mental status.  The patient would
become increasingly agitated with withdrawal of her sedation. The
patient self-extubated on [**2-24**], and oxygen saturations
remained stable thereafter.  The patient continued to be treated
for presumed ventilator-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and
gentamicin after she was transferred to the hospital floor.  Her
antibiotic therapy will be discontinued on [**3-8**].

 2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] on pressor agents.  These were
discontinued soon after her arrival.  The patient was
intermittently tachycardic, worse with temperature spikes and
sedative withdrawal.  She also had transient episodes of
hypotension which were responsive to fluid boluses.  After
extubation, she remained
