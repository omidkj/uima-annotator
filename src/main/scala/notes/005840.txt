Allergies:
Zosyn / Percocet

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Permanent Pacemaker

History of Present Illness:
89 year old woman with HLD, CAD s/p DES to RCA in [**2191**], atrial
fibrillation, and PulmHTN who presents with generalized
weakness. Patient was seen in the ED [**10-7**] after scheduled visit
with NP on [**10-7**] where patient was found have HR in 140s. In ED
yesterday pt was in Afib with rates in 60s at that time, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
saw patient who agreed with plan to send home, with [**Doctor Last Name **] of
hearts holter monitor and add 12.5mg metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] to her
medications (in addition to her home verapamil SR 240mg AM and
dronedarone 400 mg [**Hospital1 **]). She was discharged home and the next
day still felt weak with which promopted her to return. Of note
seen on [**9-1**] with similar symptoms of weakenss noted to not be
on appropriate Dronedarone regimen at that time. Notes that the
malaise has been worsening in the last several months and
significantly worse in the last 6-8 weeks accompanied by DOE.
.
This admission, in the ED, initial vitals were 98.2, 65, 102/81,
16, 97% on 2L NC. EKG showed Afib with rate in the 30s-40s and
SBP dropped to the 80s-90s. No CP, no nausea, no emesis. She was
given glucagon 0.5mg (to reverse BB), calcium gluconate 1g (to
reverse CCB) without response, Dopamine added which increasd HR
to 60s and SBPs to 100s. Also in [**Name (NI) **] pt became Hypoxemic,
requiring NRB with SaO2 98%. Repeat CXR showed mild worsening of
congestion. Levo 750mg was given at that time to cover for
"anything." Has 18 and 20g PIVs.

Imaging
[**2203-10-17**] CXR
ReportCONCLUSION:
1. Pulmonary edema has resolved since [**2203-10-11**].
2. Right lower lung opacities have increased since previous
exam. It could be due to atelectasis and lower lung volume;
however, aspiration or pneumonia cannot be excluded.
.
ECG [**10-15**]:
Atrial paced rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. Prolonged Q-T
interval at 0.47.
Compared to the previous tracing no change.
.
ECHO [**10-10**]:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal free wall
function. There is abnormal diastolic septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular volume overload. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-17**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
89 yo female with h/o pAfib, CAD, who presented to ED with
weakness, found to be bradycardic to 30s-40s and MAPs of 50s,
and hypoxemic with SaO2 in 80s requiring Dopamine and NRB.
Weaned off Dopamine and NRB within 24 hours.
.
# Atrial Fibrillation with Bradycardia: Afib is paroxysmal. In
ED HR 30s-40s in Afib, increased to 90s after brief course of
dopamine. Etiologies include new medications (recent addition of
Metoprolol), MI (no s/s on EKG and neg enzymes), Infection (no
fever, +leukocytosis), metabolic disturbances (electrolytes
wnl).  In [**Name (NI) **] Pt received glucagon, ca gluconate and then HR
increased to 60s after Dopamine started. Home regimen includes
Verapamil ER 240 in AM and 120 in pm, Dronedarone 400mg/day,
Dabigatran 75mg/day, [**10-7**] Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] added Metop 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **] when
pt was in ED on [**10-7**]. We decided to hold all Afib meds except
Verapamil. Dabigatran was restarted during hospitalization. Echo
was checked that was not concerning. It was noted that the
patient's QTc was ~ 500msec, which prompted disucssion of PPM.
Pt was then scheduled for a permanent pacemaker, which was
placed on [**10-11**]. The patient was treated with 3 days of Abx post
PPM placement per protocol. Dronedarone stoppped due to CHF and
QTc. Sotalol was started [**10-11**]. Patient's QTc was monitored and
stable at 480 on day of discharge.
.
# Non Respiratory Dependent Hypoxemic Respiratory Distress: Pt
required NRB in ED and in CCU for < 24 hours. Crackles
appreciated 1/2 up B/L and CXR consistent with pulmonary edema.
We continued diuresis with significant improvement. Pt was on RA
in < 48 hours. We started pt on home Lasix. Patient with some
crackles continued, CXR that showed small/moderate R pleural
effusion and only mild interstial edema. Likely component of
chronic fibrosis [**2-17**] amiodarone. CXR on day of discharge showed
improved pulm edema and increased RLL atelectasis vs. pneumonia.
Once the patient was up moving around and taking deep breaths
her O2 saturation improved. Finding on CXR clinically most
likely atelectasis.

Chronic Issues:
# CAD with RCA stent in [**2191**]: Asymptomatic. EF > 55% in from
[**2200**]. No EKG changes, TnT negative. No CP. We continued ASA 81,
Atorva 20, EKGs were trended, Echo repeated and showed EF 55%,
and severe TR.
.
# Hypothyroidism: asymptomatic, TSH wnl. We cont home dose
levothyroxine
.
# Constipation - noted to be a problem at her last outpatient
visit. We continued Senna/Colace/Bisacodyl
.
