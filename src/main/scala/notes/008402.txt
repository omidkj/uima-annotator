Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Keflex / Cefepime

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**]
Chief Complaint:
weight loss

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
84 yo M with CLL initially admitted on [**2195-2-9**] to rule out
infection in the setting of fatigue, weight loss, and poor
appetite. He developed fever to 101 on [**2-15**], along with
diarrhea. Work-up with urinalysis, CXR, and CT abdomen/pelvis
did not reveal a source of infection. The patient was started
empirically on vancomycin/cefepime/Flagyl, although he has an
allergy to cefepime. Earlier this evening, at around 5 p.m. on
[**2-16**], the patient developed hypotension to SBP 80s in the
setting of fever to 100.7. It is unclear if he was symptomatic
from his hypotension. He was treated with 3.7 L of NS, but then
developed tachypnea and wheezing. He was treated with nebs
without significant improvement in his tachypnea. However, his
oxygenation remained good, and his ABG was 7.48/24/75. In the
setting of poor venous access, he had an 18-gauge PIV placed in
his forearm and also had two lower extremity IV's placed. He was
transferred to the ICU for further management.
.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient complained of shortness of
breath, but he stated that this was started to improve. He also
complaiend of back and neck pain.

2. Age-related atrophy.
3. Small vessel ischemic disease.

CT Torso [**2195-2-24**]: 1. Worsening volume overload with pleural
effusions, ascites, and anasarca.
2. Stable intrathoracic lymphadenopathy, other than an increased

3. Decreased intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly.
.
TTE [**2195-2-26**]: Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 55-60%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened without aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) central aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a small,
echolucent, circumferential pericardial effusion without
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
IMPRESSION: Small circumferential pericardial effusion without
echocardiographic signs of hemodynamic impairment.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-2-20**], a
small pericardial effusion is now present.
.
Peritoneal fluid flow cytometry:
Non-diagnostic study.
A limited panel to assess B-cell clonality was attempted,
however low cellularity and dim surface immunoglobulin staining
precludes reliable assessment. If clinically indicated, a repeat
specimen may be submitted to the flow cytometry laboratory.
Review of corresponding cytospin showed mostly small mature
appearing lymphocytes with few admixed layer lymphocytes and
histiocytes.

Cytology: negative for malignant cells

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 79**] is 84M with CLL initially admitted on [**2195-2-9**] to rule
out infection in the setting of fatigue, weight loss, and poor
appetite, now with fevers or unclear etiology, transferred to
MICU for hypotension and tachypnea. Pt intubated for airway
protection given one episode of coffee ground emesis, had an
episode of wide complex tachycardia peri-intubation and loaded
with amiodarone. He was extubated on [**1-/2112**] and did well in terms
of respiration since then. His course in ICU complicated by
sinus bradycardia, thought to be related to amiodarone loading
and hypothermia, now improved to 50-60s.  Since being on the
floor, active issues have included gross volume overload,
ascites, and LLL collapse.
