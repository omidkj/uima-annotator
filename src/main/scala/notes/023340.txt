hospitalized for shortness of breath thought [**3-18**] to CHF
([**Date range (1) 20443**]). Diuresed with successful resolution of symptoms
.
On the day prior to admission, daughter called PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]:
psychiatric concerns (non-sensical conversations, confusion re:
meds). Saw psych this morning; felt that pt. thought process
linear and cognition intact. Saw PCP on the afternoon of
admission and complained of SOB. O2 sat was 89% RA and improved
with supplemental O2 by NC. She also complained of chest
pressure at that time and received SLNTG with good effect, she
was then sent to ED.
.
In ED the pt was afebrile c BP 175/74. Negative set of cardiac
enzymes. Etiology of dyspnea remained unclear and she was
treated for CHF c 20 IV lasix, COPD flare c solumedrol,
levofloxacin, nebulizers, and treated for possible CAD
contributing to symptoms. She Recevied ASA, lopressor, and had
one episode of CP in ED requiring SLNTG.

.
CXR:
1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
2. Stable left middle mediastinal contour irregularity, likely
related to a trotous aorta and unchanged since [**2115**].
3. Left lung base scarring.
.
HEAD CT:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
.
CXR [**5-11**]
IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions. Partial
obscuration of both hemidiaphragms may be related to effusions
and body habitus, but early basilar pneumonia is not excluded.
Followup radiographs may be helpful.
.
CTA CHEST:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus.

2. Asymmetric dilatation of descending thoracic aorta.
Differential diagnosis includes a large penetrating ulcer,
changes from prior focal aortic dissection or a post-traumatic
pseudoaneurysm. There is no evidence of acute aortic dissection.

3. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. No pleural effusion.

4. Severe emphysema with superimposed areas of ground-glass
opacity which could represent congestive heart failure. No
pleural effusion.

5. Concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.

6. Abrupt cut-off of suprahepatic inferior vena cava,
incompletely assessed.

7. Two right lung pulmonary nodules measuring up to 5 mm. Given
underlying emphysema, three-month followup chest CT is
recommended.
.
MR HEAD:
IMPRESSION: No acute infarct or enhancing abnormalities.
.
[**Month/Year (2) **]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen
ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with
maneuvers (however
images suboptimal; cannot exclude). There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is at least moderate pulmonary
artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.

No vegetation identified (cannot exclude).
.
.
P-MIBI: IMPRESSION: Normal myocardial perfusion. Normal left
ventricular cavity size. Calculated LVEF 57%. No anginal type
symptoms or ischemic EKG changes
.
WRIST X_RAY:
1. Subtle early erosion of the distal radial-ulnar joint and
ulnar styloid could be consistent with history of [**Month/Year (2) 20440**]
[**Month/Year (2) 20441**].

2. Osteoarthritic change at the first CMC joint. Diffuse
demineralization..
.
FOOT X_RAY:
RIGHT FOOT: There is no fracture or dislocation. There is
diffuse demineralization. There is no osseous erosion or joint
space narrowing, but there is mild spurring at the
tarsometatarsal joints dorsally. There are clawtoe deformities
and lateral deviation at the tarsometatarsal joints. There is
prominent ankle soft tissue swelling. No soft tissue
calcification or radiopaque foreign bodies are seen.

LEFT FOOT: There is no fracture or dislocation. There is no
osseous erosion or joint space narrowing. Several clawtoe
deformities are seen, and there is lateral tarsometatarsal
deviation. There is diffuse demineralization. There is prominent
ankle soft tissue swelling.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the floor for further of hypoxia,
fevers, and altered mental status. Her active hospital issues
include:
.
.
# Hypoxia:  While on the floor she was hypoxic and had a new O2
requirement. She was treated for Pneumonia and for CHF.
Antibiotics used were ceftriaxone and azithromycin. She was
aggresivly diuresed to the point of a bump in creatinene wihtout
resolution of her hypoxia. She also received steroids at the
beginning of her admission for possible COPD, but these were
quickly d/c'd after onyl 1 dose in ED [**3-18**] mental status.
Ammonia, B12, folate,TSH all normal, RPR negative. No
significant hypo- or hyperglycemia. Blood and urine cultures
were negative. Additionally patient continued to have continued
hypoxia and ABG on [**5-12**] was 7.41/42/58/28.
.
On [**5-12**] the pt was transferred to the MICU for intubation to
treat her hypoxia and allow for deep sedation to obtain
diagnostic tests. She was briefly intubated on [**5-13**] so that she
could complete her diagnostic w/u and then extubated. LP was
negative for infection, EEG was negative for seizure, MRI did
not show stoke or mass, and CTA was negative for PE. It did show
ground glass opacities on uncertain etiology. Pulmonary and
infectious disease became involved after transfer back to the
floor. Pulmonary recommended PFTs which were scheduled but the
