Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
Epigastric / LUQ pain with localized peritonitis and ARF (Cr
5.9), Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Percutaneous Cholecystostomy Tube

History of Present Illness:
71 year old woman, h/o multiple abdominal surgeries for peptic
ulcer disease with recurrent stenosis, gastrectomy in [**2109**] for
PUD (s/p multiple revisions), CAD s/p CABG x 5, CHF with EF=25%,
who presented to [**Hospital3 2783**] with sudden onset of
abdominal and back pain associated with hypotension. Pt states
that she woke up 2 nights prior, went to bathroom, and fell
(wasn't using her walker); does not know if she syncopized.
Denies loss of bowel or bladder function; denies prodromal
CP/SOB/seizure/palpitations. Was not confused afterwards and
denies trauma to head. The next day she felt fine, but the
following morning, she woke up with severe, sharp, lower
abdominal pain ([**7-5**], constant, RLQ/RMQ) with pain in her mid
back. Denies nausea/vomiting/diarrhea. States her legs felt weak
but denied any loss of bowel/bladder function. States she also
felt dizzy but denies lightheadedness or syncope. Also reports
some SOB/wheezing. Denies any change in weight (b/l wt about 134
lb) or increase in LE edema. No new rashes. States that for a
few weeks, she has been taking QID Celebrex (1 tab) plus
Ibuprofen (2 tabs) as per her PCP for joint pain. Denies any new
medications. She reports decrement in UO starting today.
.
She presented to the [**Hospital1 2436**] ED with this abdominal pain, leg
weakness. VS were initially stable (97.4 84/38 73 18 98% RA)
with some low SBP. Bedside US was negative for AAA, and
non-contrast abdominal CT did not show significant abnormalities
(?gallstones, diverticulitis of sigmoid). Labs were notable for
Creatinine of 5.8 (new), potassium of 7.6 (treated with HCO3,
insulin, D50, kayexalate). She was also noted to have a
non-anion gap acidosis with a HCO3 of 8. WBC was 10.5 with 8%
bands, and she was given 1 dose of imipenem. Her mental status
remained within normal limits, and she was started on dopamine
and levophed for hypotension (SBPs 70-80s). ABG showed severe
acidosis -- 7.01/32/63. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 71 yo female, h/o multiple abdominal surgeries, CAD s/p
CABG, CHF, p/w abdominal and back pain, hypotension, transferred
for further management.
.
1. Renal Failure and hyperkalemia: New renal failure (last Cr
here in [**2133**] was wnl). She has been taking large doses of NSAIDS
as an [**Last Name (LF) 3782**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] AIN is a possibility. In addition, if she has
been hypotensive at home, ATN is a possibility as well.
Currently oliguric (had 100 cc UO at OSH when foley placed). No
other new medications or exposures. [**Month (only) 116**] be prerenal/dehydrated
if has systemic infection.
Labs, BUN, Cr, and lytes were monitored daily. Her meds were
renally doseed. Her K was treated appropriate (hold home K
supplements). She received 1 L HCO3. Her acidosis and
hyperkalemia likely in setting of this ARF; may need HD if can't
manage these metabolic derangements. Initial Cr 5.8, K 8.1.
Oliguric. K better with HCO3 (was acidemic on admit). BUN/Cr
peaked at 80/7.1, now coming down with increased UOP. Resp
status good.

Also hypoCa on admit, suspect vit D defic and sepsis. Repleting
with IV CaGluc, po Ca, calcitriol.
.
2. Non-gap acidosis: No diarrhea; ?renal failure or RTA. Very
low serum bicarbonate (may be consistent with distal RTA). Most
likely in setting of renal failure
.
3. Abdominal pain: Surgery was consulted for the pain. An US
showed Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis. Stone
in distal CBD, with intrahepatic biliary dilatation. Distended
GB w/ mult gallstones. On [**2-3**], she went to IR: perc. GB
drainage.
The Bile grew out GPR and GNR. She was started on Zosyn amd then
switched to Augmentin when cultures grew out ENTEROCOCCUS.
She will go home with the cholecystostomy tube in place and
return in a couple weeks for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
.
4. Hypotension: ?setting of infection /sepsis. Has received 2 L
at OSH. On Dopa/Levophed. EF=25%. She received 1L with HCO3
(hyperchloremic acidosis). She was on pressors and theses were
weaned (dopa first). On [**2137-2-11**] she was hypotensive to 80/60
with ambulation. She was encouraged to maintain hydration,
especially in the presence of diarrhea. She received a 1L fluid
bolus for hypovolemia. She then received 1 unit of PRBC on
[**2137-2-11**] for symptomatic anemia and hypotension. Her
pre-transfusion HCT was 26.9, and post-HCT was 28.4. She
ambulated with PT and was assymptomatic.
.
5. CAD: hold BB, spironolactone, nitrate for now; can continue
ASA, EKG without acute changes (some peaked T-waves). ASA for
now
.
6. Resp: She had a small right pneumothorax on CXR and CT. IP
