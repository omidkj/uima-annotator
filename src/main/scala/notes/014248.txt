Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
unstable angina


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2140-6-3**] Coronary artery bypass graft x3 (Left internal mammary
artery > left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft > obtuse
marginal, saphenous vein graft > posterior descending artery)


History of Present Illness:
62 year old male with knownmultivessel coronary artery
disease,s/p multiple PCI(DES in [**6-4**] to the mid LCX (3.5 x 16mm
Taxus stent) and the proximal RCA
stenosis was successfully treated with a 3.5 x 12mm Taxus
stent), Diabetes Mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and
Aortic insufficiency presents to OSH with unstable angina. On
[**2133-12-11**] he underwent another cardiac catheterization
for an abnormal stress test which revealed his LAD had mild
disease. The previously placed LCx stent had a 20% ISR. The
previously placed RCA stent had a 70% ISR. The distal RCA had a
70% denovo stenosis. The ISR was treated with a 3.5 x 8 mm
Cypher DES and the distal RCA were treated with a 3.5 x 8 mm
Cypher DES. Post procedure, the RFA was angiosealed.

He underwent cardiac catheterization again on [**2134-7-16**] for
recurrent angina and an abnormal nuclear stress test.  He was
found to have an 80% stenosis of the OM for which he has been
medically managed since that time.

The patient presents to OSH reporting 10 days of crescendo
angina, substernal chest pain with minimal exertion, and at
rest.He underwent cardiac cath which revealed ostial and mid LAD
with significant stenosis. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
evaluation of revascularization.

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2140-6-2**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%). TDI E/e' >15, suggesting
PCWP>18mmHg. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. Mild mitral
annular calcification. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation with
normal valve morphology. No pericardial effusion. Increased
PCWP.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-6-2**], the
overall findings are similar.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2136**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT
