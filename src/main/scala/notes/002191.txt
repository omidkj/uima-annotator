   FLUID CULTURE (Final [**2156-9-5**]):
      Due to mixed bacterial types ( >= 3 colony types) an
abbreviated
      workup is performed appropriate to the isolates recovered
from the
      site (including a screen for Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Staphylococcus
      aureus and beta streptococcus).
      KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE.    MODERATE GROWTH.
         Trimethoprim/Sulfa sensitivity testing available on
request.
      STAPH AUREUS COAG +.    MODERATE GROWTH.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.  PENICILLIN SENSITIVITY AVAILABLE ON
REQUEST.
      ENTEROCOCCUS SP..    MODERATE GROWTH.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10733**] presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for work-up of RUQ pain and
hypotension. He was transferred to the SICU for blood pressure
management with vasopressors, correction of electrolyte
imabalances, IV hydration, and IV antibiotics.
.
CARDIAC:His blood pressure stabilized in the ICU, and he was
weaned from the vasopressors. His hemodynamic status normalized,
and he was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name **] for further management of the
acute cholecystitis.He was transitioned back to his oral
medication regimen once he was able to tolerate PO fluids. His
blood sugars were elevated ranging 150-300's. Adjustments were
made to the regular sliding scale for tighter control with
positive affect, and he was restarted on his NPH and Humalog.
.
NUT:He remained NPO for a few days to aid in resolution of the
cholecystitis. His labwork returned to baseline, and his diet
was advanced to regular, cardiac/diabetic healthy diet. He was
tolerating regular food without complaints of nausea/vomiting.
.
ID:He underwent a RUQ Ultrasound at an outside hospital revealed
sludge, thickening, fluid around gallbladder. A repeat
ultrasound was obtained at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2156-9-2**] which confirmed the
ultrasoud findings from the outside hospital, and the presence
of acute cholecystitis. He underwent a CT guided drainage of the
gallbladder which was sent for cultures & sensitivitied. His IV
antibiotic regimen was adjusted according to culture
sensitivities. He remained afebrile, and was transitioned to
oral Ampi and Cipro on [**2156-9-5**]. He will finish the 2 week
regimen at home.
.
GI/ABD:His abdomen is round and nontender, skin intact. He has
bowel sounds in all four quadrants. He reports passing gas. He
was started on a bowel regimen to promote a bowel movement. He
has a Right lower flank percutaneous pigtail drainage device.
The site is intact, and draining small amounts of bilious fluid.
He and his family were instructed on drain care and flushing at
discharge. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks.
.
PAIN:He reports 0/10 pain presently. His RUQ pain has subsided.
He had been intially managed with IV Dilaudid with adequate
relief. He was transitioned to oral Dilaudid, and will be
discharged home with a 2 week supply to be used as needed.
