History of Present Illness:
57y M s/p gastric bypass on [**3-26**] ([**Hospital 882**] hospital), no
complications discharged [**2154-3-30**], was on SC heparin as well as
venodynes. On [**4-1**] had some left calf pain with ambulation, no
edema. On [**4-1**] some mild pleuritic CP Wife reported
listlessness, fatigue. Early in am of admission ([**4-2**]) after
walking down stair, fell - found by wife,
diaphoretic/unresponsive. EMS called. HR at 140, 02% 90 on
non-rebreather, RR 40-50. CTA at [**Hospital 882**] hospital showed large
saddle pulm embolism. Patient received 10,000 heparin bolus.
Patient then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to receive ICU care.

Pertinent Results:
IVC Filter Placement - IMPRESSION:
1. IVC venogram demonstrating a single and patent IVC and patent
bilateral common iliac veins. Reflux of contrast is seen into
the iliac veins consistent with elevated right atrial pressures.
2. Successful placement of a Bard recovery IVC filter within the
inferior vena cava inferior to the level of the renal veins. The
filter could be removed at any time using a jugular approach if
necessary.
.
CT CHEST:
FINDINGS: There is no axillary, hilar or mediastinal lymph
adenopathy. Coronary artery calcifications are seen along the
LAD. There are no definite pleural effusions or evidence of
pneumothorax.
On the right, there is probably linear atelectasis at the
superior segment of the the lower lobe. There is opacification
of the right posterior CP angle, probably representing
combination of consolidation and small pleural effusion. There
is discoid atelectasis vs infarction of the peripheral upper
anterior and anterior CP angle of the right middle lobe (unable
to distinguish without IV contrast). There is also ground glass
opacity of the dependent right middle lobe, probably
representing incomplete consolidation.
On the left, there is linear atelectasis at the lateral segment
of the lower lobe, as well as linear atelectasis at the lateral
lingula. Mild consolidation vs atelectais is also seen at the
left posterior CP angle.
There appears to be multiple surgical staples within the abdomen
adjacent to the stomach, and anastomotic suture lines also are
apparent along the stomach, probably relating to prior gastric
bypass surgery. IVC filter is present.
Coronally and sagittally reformatted images were also reviewed,
critical for delineating the lobar distribution of disease,
described above.
IMPRESSION:
Scattered regions of atelectasis, consolidation, and possibly
effusion as described above. Without IV contrast, we cannot
assess whether the thicker wedge-shaped opacities represent
discoid atelectasis or consolidation (pneumonia/infarction).
.
ECHO:There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
The right
ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function appears depressed. There is abnormal systolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure
overload. There is no mass/thrombus in the right ventricle. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There is no
aortic valve
stenosis. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is at least moderate
pulmonary hypertension.There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: These findings are consistent with significant RV
strain.
.
LENI: Deep vein thrombosis extending from the proximal-to-mid
left superficial femoral vein and involving the left popliteal
vein as well


Brief Hospital Course:
1)Pulmonary embolism: Pt was hemodynamically stable throughout
course. Pt was admitted directly to the MICU and treated with
heparin and coumadin.  Although pulmonary embolism was very
large, he was not a candidate for thrombolytics given his recent
gastric bypass surgery.  An echocardiogram was performed which
showed moderate symmetric LVH, LVEF > 75%, no thrombus in the
LV, dilated RV, depressed RV function, and abnormal RV systolic
motion c/w RV pressure overload. LENI's showed DVT at left
popliteal to superficial femoral vein.  An IVC filter was placed
wtih plan on removing it in several months, at time to be
determined by pulmonary team.  Pt was continued on heparin for
48 hours after INR reached goal of [**3-14**], which was [**2154-4-9**].  It
was discussed with pt that his INR would require high frequency
checks as his diet will be changing per his post gastric bypass
surgery protocol.  It was also noted that a large component of
his diet wich was a carbohydrate drink contained Vitamin K.
His INR will be monitored closely as his diet is changed.  He
was noted to desat on room air while ambulating, so he was
discharged on home o2, 2L continuous.

2)Acute renal failure:  The patient was also noted to have a
creatinine of 1.6 upon admission to the MICU, however this
decreased to 0.9 after hydration.

3)S/p gastric bypass surgery:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] was consulted and was
involved in decisions regarding appropriate and safe
anticoagulation s/p surgery.  Pt was continued on diet as
outlined by his surgeon, with his wife bringing the nutrition
from home.  Nutrition was consulted for general recomendations
and also to educate pt regarding means of taking in more water
to stay hydrated.

Discharge Instructions:
You must follow up with [**Hospital1 **] to be followed by their
[**Hospital 2786**] clinic.  You will need to get your [**Hospital **] drawn
there multiple times a week and the nurses there will let you
know what dose of coumadin to take.

Please return to the emergency department immediately if you
become acutely short of breath or develop a new worsened chest
pain.

Your coumadin dose will need adjustment whenever you change your
post-gastric-bypass diet.
