.
ECG [**10-9**]: Sinus tachycardia. There are small R waves in the
anterior leads consistent with possible prior anterior
myocardial infarction. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared
to the previous tracing ST-T wave changes are new.
.
EEG [**10-12**]:
CONTINUOUS EEG: The background was slightly slow reaching a
maximum of
7 Hz. There were no clear epileptiform discharges or
electrographic
seizures noted.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were 91 entries in these files.
These
represented electrical and muscle artifact.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were three entries in these
files.
These represented electrical and movement artifact.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were no entries in these files.
SLEEP: There was no clear sleep architecture noted in the
record.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an
average rate
of 90 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to the
presence
of a slow background which reached a maximum of 7 Hz. This
represents a
mild encephalopathy such as can be seen in toxic/metabolic,
diffuse
ischemic, or infectious etiologies. There were no clear
epileptiform
discharges or electrographic seizures noted.
.
EEG [**10-13**]:
CONTINUOUS EEG: The background was slow reaching a maximum of
5.5 Hz.
Of note, from 15:23 onward, the patient is not being recorded,
as the
leads appear to be off.
SPIKE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were no entries in these files.
SEIZURE DETECTION PROGRAMS: There were no entries in these
files.
PUSHBUTTON ACTIVATIONS: There were no entries in these files.
SLEEP: There was no clear sleep architecture noted in the
record.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an
average rate
of 100 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal video EEG telemetry due to the
presence
of a slow background which reached a maximum of 5.5 Hz. This
represents
a moderate to severe encephalopathy such as can be seen in
diffuse
ischemia, toxic/metabolic, infectious, or other diffuse
etiologies.
Note is made of lack of readable recordings after 15:23. There
were no
clear epileptiform discharges or electrographic seizures noted.
.
[**10-13**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of definite acute abnormalities. The
apparent thin
left parietal extraaxial hyperdensity is likely an artifact, but
could be
reassessed by a follow-up CT or by MRI.
.
MR HEAD [**10-14**]:
FINDINGS:
There is considerable motion artifact degrading image quality.
The gradient echo images are nondiagnostic. There is no
intracranial mass, mass effect or abnormal enhancement. No acute
infarct is demonstrated. The ventricular dimensions and sulcal
prominence are advanced for age.
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of intracranial mass, acute infarct or abnormal
enhancement.
Gradient echo images are degraded by motion artifact. Mild
degree of
generalised cerebral atrophy advanced for age.
.
CXR [**10-14**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**9-12**] and [**9-11**], there
is some
continued opacification in the retrocardiac region medially,
concerning for pneumonia. The right PICC line now extends to the
region of the mid portion of the SVC.
.
CXR [**10-16**]:
Cardiac size is top normal. Right PICC tip is in the mid SVC in
unchanged
position. Retrocardiac opacity has improved consistent with
improving
atelectases. The right lower lobe opacity consistent with
atelectases is
unchanged. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
.
EGD/COLONOSCOPY BIOPSIES:
Intestinal mucosal biopsies, three:
A.  Duodenum:
Chronic active duodenitis with prominent increase in
subepithelial collagen, surface epithelial damage, and subtotal
villous shortening, see note.
B.  Terminal ileum:
Small intestinal mucosa with largely denuded epithelium and
increased subepithelial collagen, see note.
C.  Random colon:
1. Colonic mucosa with increased lamina propria chronic
inflammation, surface epithelial damage, and increased
intraepithelial lymphocytes, see note.
2.  No appreciable increase in subepithelial collagen noted on
H&E stained sections.
Note: In evaluable epithelium in the duodenal and terminal ileal
biopsies, there is additionally a prominent increase in
intraepithelial lymphocytes.  The findings are consistent with a
collagenous enteriti
