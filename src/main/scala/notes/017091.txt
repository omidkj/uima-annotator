Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6743**]
Chief Complaint:
Endometrial cancer c/o Respiratory Failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
laparoscopy converted to total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy - [**2180-9-18**]

History of Present Illness:
This is a 77-year-old woman with a history of a grade 1
endometrial cancer, CVA with L hemiplegia, CKD, dementia
Pelvic ultrasound revealed a 6.3 x 5.7 x 4.5 cm uterus and a [**1-27**]
cm endometrial stripe.  Bilaterally, the ovaries were unable to
be visualized due to the patient's body habitus.  I saw [**Known firstname **]
for the first time on [**6-28**], and at that point, we discussed at
length options for treatment for this problem.  I had hoped that
we would have been able to have her have an [**Month/Year (2) 2742**] by her
primary care physician to discuss her suitability for a surgical
procedure. At [**Known firstname 88797**] first visit, I had some concerns about
her status at that point and was concerned specifically as to
whether she might be able to tolerate an examination.  She was
nauseous and vomiting at that point.

77F with grade 1 endometrial carcinoma, CVA with L hemiplegia,
CKD, dementia who presented for laparoscopic hysterectomy today
and is now transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after she was unable to be
extubated post-operatively. Intubation was reported as difficult
and a glidescope was used. She underwent laparoscopic converted
to open TAH/BSO given poor visualization with cystoscopy. She
was given a total of 0.5mg midazolam, 180mg propofol, 0.6mg
hydromorphone, 200mcg fentanyl during the procedure. I/O's
700/500 with 250cc EBL, 250cc UOP. Foley was placed in OR. A L
IJ was placed intra-operatively under ultrasound guidance. She
remained hemodynamically stable throughout the case. She was
transferred to the PACU intubated after she continued to
hypoventilate when trialed on spontaneous ventilation but was
following verbal commands when aroused. She was given a total of
1.4mg IV hydromorphone in the PACU. She remained hypoventilatory
in the PACU and the decision was made to transfer her to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Prior to transfer, CXR revealed improper positioning of
the CVL into the R brachiocephalic vein. Infusion was stopped,
PIV access x2 was obtained, and CVL was pulled.

Upon arrival to the [**Name (NI) 153**], pt. is intubated and unable to answer
questions.

IMAGING
CXR ([**2180-9-18**])
In comparison with study of [**9-13**], there has been placement of a
left IJ catheter that crosses the midline and extends into the
right brachiocephalic or even jugular system. No pneumothorax.
Endotracheal tube lies only about 1.3 cm above the carina and
should be withdrawn approximately 2-3 cm. There are low lung
volumes with probable atelectatic changes at the right base
medially. Repeat study should be obtained after repositioning of
the various tubes.
.
CXR ([**2180-9-19**])
With the patient's neck in flexed position, the tip of the
endotracheal tube is approximately 1.6 cm above the carina.
Consider withdrawing the endotracheal tube by approximately [**1-27**]
cm.
.
Bilateral lung volumes remain low. Right paracardiac opacity
presumably from atelectasis is unchanged. Increased left
retrocardiac density representing a left lower lung atelectasis
is similar to the prior studies. Previously malpositioned left
internal jugular line has been removed.
.
CXR ([**2180-9-19**])
The right PICC line ends approximately in the lower SVC. Both
lung
volumes remain low. Right perihilar opacity has minimally
decreased since
prior radiograph dated [**2180-9-19**] acquired 6 hours apart
suggesting that it was atelectasis. Left lower lung retrocardiac
density suggesting lower lung volume loss is constant. However,
concomitant infection needs to be
considered in appropriate clinical setting. There are no new
lung opacities of concern.


Brief Hospital Course:
77F with grade 1 endometrial adenocarcinoma, h/o CVA with L
hemiplegia, dementia, HTN who underwent open TAH-BSO which was
complicated by hypoventilatory respiratory failure and oliguria
for which she required an ICU stay, hospital-acquired pneumonia
s/p 8 days of levofloxacin, and acute on chronic renal failure.
.
# Respiratory:
Failure to extubate after procedure felt to be [**1-26**] sedating
medications given her inital minimal vent settings.  She was
easily extubated in the morning following her procedure. She was
gradually weaned off of oxygen during her stay and received
chest PT and nebs prn. Upon discharge, her O2 sats were in the
high 90s on RA during the day, with 1 L O2 nasal cannula
requirement at night for desaturations into the high 80s. The
patient may have some underlying undiagnosed OSA.

The patient was evaluated for a low-grade fever up to 101F on
POD#2. She had bl
