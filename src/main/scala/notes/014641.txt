[**Doctor Last Name 4726**] and two endografts.

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant 81 year old female who was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after for "leaked descending TAA". Patient
is not a good historian with some dementia. From what we
gathered, the patient had a history of TAA. In the last
week, she has had some L shoulder pain or L flank pain. She had
an CT scan of her chest and was found to have a leak of her TAA.
In the ED here, patient was pain-free. She denied any
cp/sob/palpiation/dizziness.

IMAGING:

TTE ([**2137-10-16**]): Mild symmetric LVH with focal LV systolic
dysfunction consistent with inferior ischemia/infarction. The
mitral valve leaflets are thickened and dome in diastole which
is likely due to rheumatic mitral valve disease (although mitral
annular calcification and the relatively fixed appearance of the
posterior leaflet due to tethering are also contributing to this
appearance). Moderate mitral regurgitation. Trivial to mild
mitral stenosis. Dilated and hypokinetic RV with mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on [**2137-10-14**] for a thoracic abdominal
aortic aneurysm with a leak in the descending thoracic aorta.
She was taken to the operating room for endovascular repair with
a thoracic aortic endograft.  On postoperative day #1 she
developed respiratory distress and was transferred to the
Cardiovascular ICU. She was found to have flash pulmonary edema
and a left-sided pleural effusion. Following diuresis and a
short period of BIPAP, her breathing improved.  She was
continued on aggressive chest physcial therapy and pulmonary
toilet.

Cardiology was consulted for a troponin elevation as high as
0.36, which they felt was a leak due to demand ischemia from
tachycardia during her period of respiratory distress.  Per
Cardiology recommendations, her beta-blockade was increased and
a trans-thoracic echo was obtained, showing mild symmetric LVH
with focal LV systolic dysfunction (EF 40-45%) consistent with
an old MI per Cardiology, as well as moderate mitral
regurgitation.  She also had an increase in her creatnine to 2.1
which was felt to be secondary to contrast-induced nephropathy
in light of several dye loads.

On postoperative day #3 her respiratory status was stable, and
she was transferred back to the step-down Vascular ICU unit.
She continued to be diuresed, and was eventually weaned off O2
nasal cannula.  She proceeded to have intermittent episodes of
confusion at night, which was attributed to sun-downing.  She
was started on nightly seroquel, and her confusion resolved.

Ms. [**Known lastname **] was deemed an appropriate candidate for a rehab
facility by physical therapy.  She was deemed appropriate for
discharge to rehab and was accepted for transfer on [**2137-10-23**].
