Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Somnolence

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
67-yo morbidly obese woman transferred from [**Hospital3 **] w/
hypotension and atrial fib.  Last night, she took 10 percocet
tablets for acute on chronic low back pain.  This AM, she was
discovered by her son to be lethargic and unresponsive.  He
called EMS, who administered Narcan in the field resulting in
rapid improvement in the pt's mental status.  Upon arrival to
[**Hospital3 **] ED, she was in atrial fibrillation w/ HR 120s,
BP 104/70, groggy but responsive.  EKG showed ST changes thought
to be ST elevations in V1-V2.  She was treated w/ ASA 324 mg,
heparin gtt, and diltiazem 30 mg IV followed by 5 mg/hr gtt,
resulting in BP decrease to 66/40 and HR decrease to 80s.  She
was then treated w/ phenylephrine gtt for BP support through a
peripheral IV.  She is now transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] CCU for
ongoing care.
.
Currently, she is on phenylephrine, diltiazem, and heparin gtt.
She denies any recent chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea,
presyncope, or syncope.  Further history is unavailable at
present due to pt's lethargy.

Radiology:
[**4-15**] VQ Scan
No perfusion/ventilation mismatches identified.
Findings suggest possibility of a compressive mass lesion in the
left hilar
region and CT chest is recommended for further evaluation.
.
[**4-15**] CT Angio Chest:
CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There are no filling defects in the
pulmonary arterial vasculature. Small peripheral lung nodule (2,
24) measuring 3 mm is seen in the right upper lobe. A second
larger nodule measuring 4.5 mm (2, 23 is also seen in the right
upper lobe. There are coronary artery calcifications present.
Smooth interlobular septal thickening with areas of ground-glass
opacity are seen throughout both lung fields with tiny bilateral
pleural effusions, right greater than left and associated
atelectasis at the lung bases. Findings are consistent with
fluid overload. Few images through the upper abdomen are normal.
The airways are patent at the level of the segmental bronchi
bilaterally. No enlarged axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph
nodes are present. Small hilar lymph nodes on the right measure
8 mm (2,22).
IMPRESSION: 1) No lung mass seen. Small pulmonary nodules as
described above. If there is a history of smoking or other risk
factors, a follow up chest CT in 12 months is recommended to
document stability.
.
[**4-15**]: Echo:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
16-20 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall
hypokinesis c/w primary pulmonary process (COPD, pulmonary
embolism, etc.). Preserved global left ventricular systolic
function.


Brief Hospital Course:
67-yo-woman w/ DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia, COPD, low back pain
transferred from OSH w/ lethargy, hypotension, and atrial
fibrillation after percocet overdose.  Hospital course by
problem:
.
#) Hypotension: Etiology likely iatrogenic from diltiazem w/
contribution from opioid overdose. There were no signs of
infection; no reason to suspect adrenal insufficiency or
significant volume depletion. Was briefly on neosynephrine but
this was quickly weaned.  We restarted losartan and beta blocker
and she was normotensive for >24 hours prior to discharge.
.
#) Atrial fibrillation: Initially, this appeared to be a new dx
of atrial fib. Possible causes in this case include COPD,
cardiac ischemia, hypoxia, and thyroid disease. We rate
controlled first with dilt then metoprolol (given slight
troponin leak).  She spontaneously converted to NSR on [**4-14**].  We
treated first with heparin gtt.  On further questioning, patient
reports that she may have been told that she had an irregular
heartbeat in the past.  Given this possible recurrence of Afib,
we recommend treatment with coumadin.  We discharged the patient
on coumadin in addition to her BB and ask that she have an INR
check two days following discharge.  She had direct instructions
from us to go to her PCP's office for a lab draw.
- We have set her up to see a cardiologist in [**Hospital1 **] as
mentioned below.  We will provide his office with this summary.
.
#) Cards ischemic: patient had slight enzyme leak as above.
This was likely in the setting of a tachycardia and her enzymes
were trending downward prior to discharge.  We performed an echo
which showed RV free wall hypokinesis and RA pressures which
were 16-20mm Hg.  There was no regional wall motion abnl of the
left ventricle.  We discharged patient on BB with close
followup.
- also started ASA prior to discharge
.
#) respiratory: patient was able to tolerate room air.  However,
given the above mentioned findings on echo, we performed a V/Q
scan to assess for PE.  There was no evidence of a PE.
- patient with likely sleep apnea given body habitus.  We would
recommend a sleep study within the near future.
.
#) Pulmonary nodules: The V/Q scan demonstarted a possible
mediastinal mass which prompted the above mentioned CT scan.  It
did not confirm such a mass.  However, pulm nodules were noted
as abo
