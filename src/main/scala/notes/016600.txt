Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1253**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p Arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated with endotracheal tube

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]M with history of Afib on coumadin, PVD, hypothyroidism
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] s/p arrest found to have small
intraventricular hemorrage, unclear etiology of arrest. Per
sister, who lives in apt below, patient has been in usual state
of health. She found him this am in bathtub with water running -
reported to be breating. EMS arrived, AED with VT, had CPR, no
shock given. Loaded with amiodorone in the field, transferred to
Lawsrence [**Hospital1 107**]. At [**Hospital3 1443**], Febrile to 100.8,
recieved avalox for possible PNA and Rocephin for UTI. CT with
left intraventricular hemorrhage. Recieved Vitamin K for
elevated INR and fosphenytoin for seizure prophylaxis.
Transferred on propofol for comfort. Of note, no written report
of PEA arrest at OSH that was verbally reported in sign-out.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], patient arrived hypotensive 60-70/30 with
HR 56. Propofol was discontinued, levophed started. He went into
PEA arrest at 1244, recieved epi 1 mg (?2 mg), levophed titrated
up, right femoral CVL placed. Large incontinence of stool.
Neurosurgery consulted and recommended no intervention at this
time with serial CT Head and managment of coagulopathy. Neuro
felt seizure unlikely the cause of shock. Due to acidosis,
started on bicarb gtt. Placed on Fentanyl/Versed for sedation.
Also recieved 18 units of Factor 9 to reverse coagulopathy and
4L IVF. After ROSC, he was moving all 4 extremities. Not cooled
due to ICH.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]M admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] s/p PEA arrest. He was found in his
bathrub with water running. Had CPR in the field with no shock
given, amiodarone given. At [**Hospital3 1443**] Hosp, he was
treated with avalox and rocephin for possible pneumonia and UTI
respectively. CT showed left intraventricular hemorrhage.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] hypotensive. Started on levophed. Again
went into PEA arrest with epinephrine given, levophed titrated
up, bicarb given due to acidosis. He was placed on
fentanyl/versed for sedation, given 18 u factor 9 to reverse
coagulopathy. Not cooled due to ICH.  Decision was made to make
patient CMO. He was extubated and transferred to the medicine
service for futher care.

# Cardiac arrest: He achieved return of spontaneous circulation
in the ED. He was transferred to the ICU intubated on pressure
support with levophed for a MAP >60. Attempts were made to
determine the etiology of the arrest. He had an echocardiogram
which showed an "ejection fraction of 25%, mildly dilated LA,
mild symmetric LVH, mid-distal anteroseptal and apical akinesis
and hypokinesis elsewhere, RV cavity dilated with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis, mild AR, mild MR, no pericardial
effusion." Cardiac enzymes did not suggest massive new MI.
Bilateral LENIs did not show any DVTs. Cardiac arrhythmia
possible given hx of A-fib. A family meeting was held in which
the patient's code status was changed to DNR (no shocks or chest
compressions). It was determined that we would not further
escalate care or pursue more invasive measures such as a-line
placement or HD at this time. On [**9-7**] he passed SBT with a RSBI
of 23 and he was switched to pressure support. Upon further
discussion with the family, it was decided to palliatively
extubate. The palliative care team was made aware and will help
make patient as comfortable as possible. Pt was extubated on
[**9-8**] and made comfort measures only.
.
# Hypotension: Unclear etiology of hypotension; echo showed
depressed ejection fraction so maybe cardiogenic in origin.
Unlikely to be hypovolemia given lack of bleeding source and
lack of response to aggressive fluid resucitation. Attempts were
made to place radial and femoral a-lines but were unsuccessful
due to peripheral arterial disease. IVF and levophed were used
to keep urine output >30cc/hr and a MAP >60. ACEI and BB were
held throughout.
.
# CHF/A-fib: Acuity of his CHF is unclear as discussed above.
His supratherapeutic INR was reversed in the setting of IVH and
his anti-coagulation was held. His ACEI and BB were held in the
setting of hypotension.
.
# IVH: likely secondary to fall in the setting of
supratherapeutic INR. Bleed is not large enough to precipitate
PEA arrest. A CT head showed no interval change in
intraventricular hemorrhage in the temporal and occipital horns
of the left lateral ventricle. He received frequent neuro
checks. The neurosurgery team felt no need for intervention at
this time.
.
# AG metabolic acidosis and appropriate compensatory respiratory
alkalosis: AG likely due to lactic acidosis. No evidence of DKA
or other toxin exposures. He was given aggressive fluid
resuscitation and his lactate trended down throughout his MICU
stay.
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Was likely to be pre-renal or ATN in the setting of
shock. We do not know the baseline status of his renal function.
His lisinopril and HCTZ were held throughout his stay. He was
given adequate fluid resucitation. On [**9-7**] he had a potassium
of 5.7. An EKG did not demonstrate peaked T-waves. He was given
30mg of kayexalate.
.
# DM - diet controlled with fingersticks qACHS, start gentle
insulin SS
.
# hypothydroidism  - thyroid medication dosage not confirmed
prior to his status as being made CMO.
.
# Lung nodules - a CT demonstrate ground glass opacities and a
nodules that should be followed up in [**2-1**] months.
.
# Comfort measures only
The decision was made to make the patient CMO. He was extubated
and transferred to the medicine service. Palliative care was
consulted. Patient was made comfortable with morphine and
scopolamine and other comfort measures. He was admitted to
hospice care and expired on [**2161-9-16**].
