Admission Date:  [**2174-12-30**]       Discharge Date:  [**2175-1-7**]


Service:  NEUROSURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 82-year-old
nun who tripped and fell, hitting the back of her head on a
step on her way into church.  She had no loss of
consciousness.  She sat through church and then went to an
outside hospital secondary to a laceration on the back of her
head.  Head CT at the outside hospital showed bilateral
subarachnoid hemorrhage with small subdural hematoma and left
temporal contusion.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further management.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  A pleasant woman in no acute distress.
HEENT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  EOMS
full.  Ecchymosis under the left eye.
CHEST:  Clear to auscultation.
CARDIAC:  S1 and S2.  No murmur, rub or gallop.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel
sounds.
EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
NEUROLOGICALLY:  Awake, alert and oriented x 3.  Cranial
nerves II through XII were intact.  Motor exam was [**4-26**] in all
muscle groups.  Sensation was intact to light touch.  Her
reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities, 2+ at the knees,
absent at the ankles.  Toes were downgoing.

The patient had a head CT which showed traumatic subarachnoid
hemorrhage with left temporal contusion, and a question of a
right ICA, possible P-COM aneurysm.  The patient had a CTA
which was negative for aneurysm.  The patient was monitored
in the ICU, remained neurologically stable, and was
transferred to the regular floor.

The patient also had an episode of chest pain in the
Emergency Room and took one of her own sublingual Nitro.
CPKs and MBs were sent, and the patient was ruling-in for an
MI.  Cardiology was consulted, and the patient was
transferred back to the ICU.  The patient was started on
metoprolol for rate control.  She had an EKG that did show
some ST changes which they felt could be secondary to either
ischemia or neurocardiac injury.  They would have liked to
start her on aspirin, but secondary to the hemorrhage that
was not feasible.  She had an echo done while admitted.  It
showed persistent ST changes with LVH and strain.

The patient was also seen by endocrine for an incidental
thyroid mass found on head CT.  Endocrine spoke with the
patient's primary care physician who will [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] with the
thyroid nodule once the acute issues have resolved.

Cardiology continued to follow the patient.  Metoprolol was
increased to 150 mg po bid, but still did not have very good
rate control.  She did go into AFIB while she was in the ICU.
Cardioversion was planned, and then the patient was put on a
diltiazem drip, and she converted to sinus rhythm.  Her CPKs
and MBs peaked at 491 with an MB of 53, and a troponin of
0.7.  She did remain cardiac stable after converting to sinus
rhythm and was transferred to the regular floor on telemetry
on [**2175-1-3**].

Neurologically, she remained stable.  She did have a repeat
head CT 24 hours after admission which showed blossoming of
the contusion.  However, her neurological exam remained
stable.  She was awake, alert, oriented x 3, moving all
extremities with good strength, no drift, and no neurological
deficits.  She has remained neurologically stable.  She has
continued to be followed by cardiology who was recommending
changing the verapamil to diltiazem for better rate control.
Currently, her blood pressure is running in the 120-140
range.  Her heart rate has been in the 80s-90s, sinus rhythm.
She remained neurologically stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Diltiazem 30 mg po qid.
2. Metoprolol 150 mg po bid--hold for SBP less than 100.
3. Isosorbide 20 mg po bid.
4. Famotidine 20 mg po bid.
5. Cefazolin 1 gm IV q 8 h for CSF leak.
6. Heparin 5,000 U subcu q 12 h.
7. Nitroglycerin 0.3 sublingual prn.
8. Colace 100 mg po bid.
9. Atorvastatin 10 mg po qd.
10.Percocet 1-2 tabs po q 4 h prn.

CONDITION:  Stable.

FOLLOW-UP:  She will follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in 1 month with a
repeat head CT.  She
should continue on IV antibiotics.

She was seen by physical therapy and occupational therapy and
felt to require a short rehab stay prior to discharge to
home.  Her vital signs have been stable.  She has been
afebrile.  Neurologically stable.
