Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
Class IV heart failure, here for [**First Name3 (LF) **] on [**2112-2-23**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2112-2-23**] TAVI/[**Year (4 digits) 10723**] percutaneous aortic valve replacement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10722**] is an 84-year-old gentleman with a history of CAD
s/p LAD stenting in [**2105**], who has known diastolic heart failure
with a normal LVEF (70%). He also has a history of tachy-brady
syndrome and underwent a permanent pacemaker
placement. In [**Month (only) 1096**], was admitted to [**Hospital3 **] with
dyspnea and treated for a presumed CHF exacerbation. Trop at OSH
was 0.07 (indeterminate) and had increased O2 requirement. He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization which
revealed nonobstructive CAD. He was evaluated for aortic valve
treatment options. After informed consent including full
explanation of risks vs. benefits, he was enrolled into the high
risk arm of the [**Hospital1 10723**]/TAVI study. He met all inclusion
criteria, and did not meet any exclusion criteria, was screened
and accepted to be randomized to either [**Hospital1 10723**]/TAVI or
surgical AVR as per study protocol.
Patient was admitted from [**2112-2-7**] - [**2112-2-12**] for optimization of
cardiac status prior to randomization in [**Month/Day/Year 10723**] study.
Patient was randomized into [**Month/Day/Year **] arm, which he will receive
during this hospitalization.  During te last hospitalization, he
was started on Pradaxa in preparation for procedure. Patient
given clear instructions to stop taking Pradaxa 3 days prior to
procedure (on [**2112-2-20**]). He was also diuresed with lasix and
achieved euvolemia, maintained on 2L oxygen, which he is on at
home.

Since his last discharge, patient has been feeling well.  He had
one episode of severe epistaxis requiring packing by an ENT at
[**Hospital 882**] Hospital.  Per the patient, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was aware of this
and oversaw his care, and his pradaxa dose was decreased.
Patient stopped taking pradaxa the day prior to admission in
anticipation of [**Last Name (STitle) **] procedure.  Patient has not had any
more episodes of epistaxis since then.

Additionally, while receiving 2 units of pRBC at [**Location (un) 620**] on
[**2-19**], he developed abdominal pain which he thought was reflux,
but was not relieved by tums.  He was admitted for cardiac
enzyme monitoring, out of concern abd pain could be cardiac in
etiology.  Troponins were trended and were 0.074, then 0.102,
then 0.121. CK-MB flat.  Subsequently, he developed diarrhea,
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 620**] report 10 episodes in one day.  Patient reports
diarrhea has improved and he now has 1-2 episodes of loose
stool.  He endorses a decreased appetite, but denies
nausea/vomiting.  C. diff was negative.

REPORTS

CXR PA/LAT [**2112-2-22**]
IMPRESSION: Interval enlargement of the right atrium and left
ventricle since [**2112-2-7**]. Persistent central vascular
congestion with mild edema.

ECHO [**2112-2-23**]
Pre implant

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45
%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is a very small
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the
results on [**2112-2-23**] at 1500 hours.

Very poor transgastric views. Unable to evaluate wall motion
thoroughly.

Post implant

[**Year (4 digits) 10723**] seen in the aortic position. Slightly lower implant.
Mild perivalvular leak present. Moderate mitral regurgitation
persists.

ECHO [**2112-2-25**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with normal
free wall contractility. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] The ascending aorta is mildly dilated.
An aortic [**Month/Day/Year **] prosthesis is present. The aortic valve
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion
and transvalvular gradients. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-12-23**], a
[**Year (4 digits) **] prosthesis is present and is functioning normally with
no evidence of a
