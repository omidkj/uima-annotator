Allergies:
Heparin Sodium / Shellfish

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3283**]
Chief Complaint:
Right hip fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right hip fracture repair (ORIF)


History of Present Illness:
 87M with MMP including DM (last HbA1c 6.7), AFib on coumadin,
CAD s/p CABG/stents, CHF (EF 25-30%), s/p pacemaker/ICD, porcine
AVR/MVR, BPH (chronic foley) presented after mechanical fall
found to have right sub-trochanteric fracture. He was at home,
woke up at 7.25AM and found his foley bag to be full. He tried
to reach the foley bag and accidentally hit the power button of
his nearby motorized wheelchair. He subsequently fell backwards.
He denies having hit anything else except his buttock and right
hip. He specifically did not hit his head. He felt pain ([**11-18**]
in severity) in his right hip and could not move without
excruciating pain. He next called 911 and was brought into the
ED.
.
Patient denies any dizziness or special events preceding the
fall, but he is known to have a very poor sense of balance since
childhood. According to the patient, he has a brain cyst since
birth responsible for his poor balance.
.
ROS: He denies any F/C/N, CP, SOB (beyond his baseline from
COPD), abdominal pain, N/V/D, bloody stools or urine, or urinary
symptoms.
.
ED: In the ED, his VS were stable. He was given Tylenol PO and
morphine 2mg iv x 2 for pain control. Hip films, Head CT and CT
C-spine were performed. They revealed no acute findings except
for a right displaced, subtrochanteric fracture. Ortho evaluated
the patient and decided to operate him in the morning after
medical clearance. His PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 2450**], also saw the patient in
the ED and it was decided to admit the patient to the medicine
service for pre-OP clearance given his multiple cardiac risk
factors.

.
EKG: NSR with LBBB (old), old Q in III, no acute changes
.
[**2-27**] Right hip and knee film:
1. Obliquely oriented fracture of the proximal right femur
extending from the lesser trochanter distally and laterally into
the proximal femoral diaphysis with foreshortening and
displacement.
2. Degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine.
.
[**2-27**] CT Head: No acute hemorrhage. No shift of midline
structures. Large porencephalic cyst within right
parietal/occiptal area unchanged compared to [**2120-4-12**]. No
hydrocephalus.
.
[**2-27**] CT C-spine: No significant malalignment. No fracture. Mild
retrolisthesis of C4 on C5. Mild- moderate degenerative disease.

.
ECHO [**2121-12-29**]: LA is moderately dilated. Mild symmetric LVH. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (20-25%). The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral valve
prosthesis is present. The transmitral gradient is normal for
this prosthesis. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
.
CXR AP [**2-27**]: A dual-chamber pacer is present with its leads
overlying the right atrium and ventricle. Median sternotomy
sutures are present. Rightward shift of the trachea which is
likely secondary to atherosclerotic changes and enlargement of
the aortic knob. The lungs are clear. No pleural effusions
present. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. Prosthetic mitral valve in
place.
.
CXR AP [**2-28**]: Increased interstitial markings, which may
represent edema. Change in course of atrial pacer lead. Is there
evidence that this may become dislodged or has it been removed?

.
Hip XR [**2-28**]: Three views. Comparison with the previous study
done [**2122-2-27**]. A comminuted fracture of the proximal femur is
again demonstrated. Major fracture fragments are transfixed by a
screw and intramedullary rod. A small butterfly fragment at the
lateral aspect of the fracture site is displaced laterally.
There is no evidence of dislocation.
.
[**3-3**] Abdomen supine & erect: Mild gaseous distention of the
stomach. Moderate amount of stool within the rectum and colon
without evidence of obstruction.


Brief Hospital Course:
87M with MMP including DM (last HbA1c 6.7), AFib on coumadin,
CAD s/p CABG/stents, CHF (EF 25-30%), s/p pacemaker/ICD, porcine
AVR/MVR, BPH (chronic foley) presented after mechanical fall
found to have right displaced, sub-trochanteric fracture, went
for ORIF, was transiently in MICU for prolonged intubation and
AICD interrogation after tachycardic runs, then stable on floor
again.
.
1. R subtrochanteric fx: Seen by Ortho in ED. Displaced on XR.
ORIF was planned on day of admission but given scheduling
issues, deferred until 7AM the next day. Patient has medium to
high risk for cardiac complications but was overall stable and
cleared for surgery based on clinical exam, stable EKG, CXR, and
labs. Plavix and coumadin were held. Pt was transiently on
Heparin drip prior surgery. Needed 1U pRBC pre-OP for transient
drop in his hematocrit. Operation went without any major
surgical events. However, patient required prolonged intubation
post-OP and thought to have VT run peri-OP. Was briefly in MICU
until extubated. EP interrogated AICD. Runs were likely not VT
but SVT with bundle branch block. Stable since transfer to
floor. Pain control initially with PCA post-OP, then with
Tylenol PO and Morphine IV. Eventually transitioned to PO
oxycodone. Patient only had two transient episodes of Afib with
RPR that postponed discharge by one day. Otherwise, he had an
uneventful hospital course after transfer to the medical floor
