Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2071**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue for one week. Transferred to CCU with hypoxic distress
in context of AF with RVR, developed PNA and transferred to MICU
with stabilized AF.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 70654**] is a 75M with a history of coronary artery disease
s/p CABG x3 ([**University/College **] Presbyterian NY, [**2145**]), PTCA x2 stents
(DES: proximal LAD and SVG to PDA, [**2156**]) as well as
assymptomatic PAF on coumadin who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2159-4-21**]
with fatigue for the last 5 days. He did not endorse shortness
of breath or chest pain, only generalized fatigue. Other ROS
were negative and notable for the absence of fevers, chills,
productive cough, sick contacts, recent travel or other
complaints.

In the ED, initial vitals: 97.8 65 132/78 16 97. CXR showed a
small new right pleural effusion. EKG showed atrial fibrillation
at a rate of 114, and ST depression II, III, AVf, V4-V6. He was
given Aspirin and placed on Oxygen. Cardiac biomarkers were
negative x 3. He was loaded with dofetilide for chemical
cardioversion of his a fib and went into NSR after the first
dose. The following morning he developed worsening dyspnea and
was found to be hypoxic with O2 sats in the 70s on RA. He
triggerred for hypoxia and was found to have expiratory wheezes
and crackles at the base. Chest x-ray showed severe scoliosis
and opacities within both lower lobes. VBG showed pH 7.42, pO2
53, pCo2 30. He was placed on a non-rebreather with O2 sats that
returned to 92%. The team felt that his symptoms were either CHF
versus pneumonia, with CHF more likely because he did not have a
white count or fever at the time. He was diuresed with 20 mg IV
lasix x 3 and had 2 L of urine output. He remained on the
non-rebreather throughout the afternoon despite the diuresis. He
was given nebulizers and ordered doxycycline and augmentin for
possible community acquired pneumonia (although he did not
receive antibiotics). At 6:30 pm nightfloat came to evaluate the
patient and was concerned. An ABG showed pH 7.42 pO2 66 and pCO2
54. Vanc and cefipime were started and the CCU was called to
evaluate the patient.

The patient was found to be tachypneic and uncomfortable, using
increase work of breathing. He was sating 92% on the
non-rebreather. He was transferred for hypoxic respiratory
distress. In the CCU he endorsed chills, but denied fever, chest
pain, palpitations, nausea, cough, abdominal pain, HA, dysuria,
myalgias, melena.

Respiratory status continued to be tenuous in the CCU requiring
face mask during the day, and BiPap overnight. Patient was not
intubated due to concerns about ability to wean from the vent.
He was treated empirically with broad spectrum.

CCU course notable for increasing respiratory distress requiring
BiPap for comfort. Initially used overnight only with face mask
during the day but increasingly requiring BiPap. Was seen by his
outpatient pulmonologist who agreed with current plan, and felt
patient likely to be difficult to wean from the vent if
intubated. +6L LOS (not counting insensible losses). Admission
weight 53.1kg, currently weighs 56.1 kg(but unreliable as bed
weight with sheets etc). Patient had intermittent A. Fib with
RVR requiring boluses of diltiazem for rate control.
