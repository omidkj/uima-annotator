Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 695**]
Chief Complaint:
Common bile duct transection

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Roux en Y hepaticojejunostomy ([**7-9**])
aortic valvuloplasty on ([**7-27**])
open tracheostomy with j tube and G tube ([**8-2**])


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 22782**] is a 78 woman s/p lap CCY on [**2184-6-4**] for gangrenous
cholecystitis, complicated by CBD transection. She was
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2184-6-21**] after satisfactory placement of
a 6.3 French biliary drain through her right biliary system
through the transected proximal CBD and into the subhepatic
space. She was discharged with her PTC open and on ciprofloxacin
and micafungin to [**Hospital1 1562**] Care and Rehabilitation Center. The
plan was to let the inflammation around her gallbladder fossa
and transected CBDsubside and then proceed with surgery to
re-establish biliary continuity (likely a RnY
hepaticojejunostomy).

On [**2184-6-28**] blood cultures obtained as part of a fever workup
returned positive for Gram positive cocci in clusters. The
patient was started on vancomycin 500mg Q12hrs. She presented to
clinic today with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and admitted for further treatment
of her bacteremia.

At admission, Mrs. [**Known lastname 22782**] reported that she felt tired. She
complained of right shoulder pain and non-focal abdominal
tenderness. She had some back pain which seemed to be an old
issue for her. Her last fever of 100.9 was onenight ago per the
patient. She denied fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
anorexia, or abdominal distention.


Past Medical History:
 HTN
- DMII
- GERD
- multiple sclerosis since age 29
- rheumatic heart disease w/ aortic stenosis (moderate aortic
stenosis & diastolic dysfunction noted on echo [**2183-11-3**]) with an
aortic valve area of 0.8cm2
- arthritis of the cervical and lumbar spine

children. Smoked briefly when she was in her 20s. Denies alcohol
or recreation/illicit drug use.

Pertinent Results:
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY :[**2184-7-2**]
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %).The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened.There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.There is
no pericardial effusion.
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY :[**2184-7-10**]
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed
(LVEF= 35-40 % secondary to hypokinesis of the septum, anterior
free wall, and apex. Contractile function of the inferior,
posterior, and lateral walls appears relatively well-preserved).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. There
are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is "critical" aortic valve stenosis
(valve orifice area approximately 0.7 cm2) (may have low
flow/low gradient component). The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2184-7-2**], the left ventricular ejection fraction and
the aortic valve orifice area are further reduced.
.
Chest X ray:[**2184-7-10**]
ET tube tip is in standard position 4.8 cm above the carina. NG
tube tip is in the stomach. Right IJ catheter tip is in the
lower SVC. Cardiac size is  top normal. There is no
pneumothorax. Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
There is no pneumothorax. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. New
right upper lobe opacity could be due to asymmetric pulmonary
edema but aspiration is also a possibility .

.
USG: [**2184-7-11**]
No portal vein occlusion. Right pleural effusion
.
Chest X Ray:[**2184-7-14**]:
Mild pulmonary edema in the left lung is unchanged. Greater
opacification in the right perihilar lung could represent
concurrent development of pneumonia.  Moderate bilateral pleural
effusion, right greater than left, is stable.  Heart size is
normal, but mediastinal veins are more engorged indicating
greater volume overload. ET tube and right internal jugular line
are in standard placements and a nasogastric tube passes into
the stomach and out of view. No pneumothorax.
.
Chest X Ray:[**2184-7-16**]
In comparison with the study of [**7-14**], the monitoring and support

devices remain in place. Continued evidence of elevation of
pulmonary venous pressure with bilateral pleural effusions. It
is difficult to determine whether the opacification in the right
perihilar region reflects elevation of venous pressure or
possibly a supervening focus of pneumonia.
.
Tube Cholangiogram and Dobbhoff  placement [**2184-7-19**]:
1. Patent right-sided biliary system without evidence for leak
or stenosis.
2. Successful placement of Dobbhoff feeding tube with
post-pyloric position of tip. The tube is ready for use.
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY :[**2184-7-27**]
There is trace aortic regurgitation. The aortic valve gradient
was not assessed. Left ventricular systolic function is
depressed with apical, mid to distal anteroseptal, anterior and
inferior hypokinesis (although regional wall motion was not
fully assessed). LV systolic function appears similar to that on
the [**2184-7-10**] study.
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY :[**2184-7-29**]
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2184-7-10**],
the aortic valve orifice area is minimally increased. Left
ventricular contractile function is significantly improved. The
increment in aortic valve orifice area is most likely explained
by improved left ventricular contractile function (low flow/low
gradient aortic stenosis)
.
CHEST X RAY:[**2184-7-29**]
IMPRESSION: Worsening pulmonary edema with increasing perihilar
opacities and moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions.
.
ABDOMINAL FLUORO: [**2184-8-2**]
IMPRESSION: Interval placement of a surgical gastrostomy tube
with the tip
seen along the right lateral margin of the thoracolumbar spine.
.
MR head [**2184-8-6**]
Small layering of old blood in the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of both
lateral ventricles with findings suggestive of communicating
hydrocephalus. No mass effect or midline shift. MRA brain
demonstrates non-visualization of distal right vertebral artery
which may be due to this artery ending in PICA or due to
occlusion in neck.
.
MRA brain [**2184-8-6**]
The major intracranial vessels are visualized except the right
distal vertebral artery. There is subtle flow signal narrowing
at right MCA bifurcation which may be artifactual or due to mild
atherosclerotic disease. The posterior communicating arteries
and anterior communicati
