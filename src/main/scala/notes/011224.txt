Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Video-assisted  thoracic surgery left lower lobe
wedge resection (req general anesthesia, intubation)

History of Present Illness:
Patient is 37 yo male with a history of asthma who presents
shortness of breath.  Patient states that his dyspnea began in
[**2187-12-21**].  He had an URI at this time with night sweats,
for which he saw his PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**2188-12-20**], the patient
developed another URI.  He was still able to play tennis and
maintained his normal activities until [**2189-3-21**].
.
At this time, he noticed dyspnea while golfing with friends.
[**Name (NI) **] then noticed that he had SOB when walking up stairs and
would often "pass out" on the top flight.  Patient visited his
PCP who gave him a prescription for Pulmicort.  Despite this
intervention, he still remained dyspneic on exertion and
returned to his PCP one week later, at which time he desated to
80% on exertion.  Patient was referred to pulmonary and was
bronched on [**9-11**].  BAL was negative for malignant cells but
showed pulm macrophages, lymphocytes, and squamous cells.
.
Patient states that he dyspnea has become progressively worse
over the past two weeks.  He is no longer able to walk to his
car without becoming short of breath.  He has been having fevers
and chills for the past two weeks, and he has lost 30 lbs over
the past three months.  He states that he has had night sweats
since his first URI in [**2187**], and he has had a cough productive
of yellow sputum for the past 3 months.
.
Review of systems is notable for frequent headaches, diarrhea
daily, and a rash on his upper arms bilaterally for the last
three months.  Patient denies leg swelling, bruising,
constipation, dysphagia, increased urinary frequency.  He
endorses palpitations.
.
In the emergency department, patient's VS were T 98.6, P 114, BP
126/77, R 18, O2 90% on RA.  He was placed on 3L of O2.  He was
started on Vanc and Levo and then transferred to the [**Hospital1 **] (CC7)
for further workup and evaluation.

Past Medical History:

(he works in [**Location (un) 86**] and [**Location (un) 7349**] and only vistited the SW eighteen

[**Name (NI) **] father and sisters are alive and well. [**Name (NI) **]
mother recently died from lung cancer

Physical Exam:
VS: T=98.4, BP 134/90, HR 94, R 22, O2 97% on 4L
GEN: Pleasant, young man, in NAD
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, No conjunctival pallor. No scleral icterus.
OP clear.
NECK: Supple, no LAD, no thyromegaly
CARDIAC: Tachycardic. RRR. Normal S1, S2. No murmurs, rubs or
[**Last Name (un) 549**].
LUNGS: Diffuse rhonchi bilaterally. L>R. Poor air movement
bilaterally.
ABD: Soft, NT, ND. No HSM
EXT: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior tibial
pulses.
SKIN: Macular rash on medial aspect of upper extremities
bilaterally.
NEURO: A&Ox3. Appropriate. CN 2-12 grossly intact. Preserved
sensation throughout. 5/5 strength throughout. [**1-21**]+ reflexes,
equal BL. Normal coordination. Gait assessment deferred


Pertinent Results:
[**9-23**] CT
Rapid progression of diffuse consolidation, most prominent in
LLL, RLL and lingula. This suggests acute infection superimposed
on a chronic process (hilar lymph nodes suggests sarcoid).
Alternatively, a continuing occupational exposure could be
considered.

[**9-23**] CXR
There is interval increase in the bilateral linear and nodular
opacities throughout both lungs. There is no pleural effusion or
pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
1. No pneumothorax.
2. Significant interval increase in the diffuse reticular
nodular
opacities seen throughout both lungs.

[**9-11**] CXR
There is no pneumothorax. Linear and nodular opacities with the
lower lobe predominance have improved in extent, compared to the
prior radiograph. No large pleural effusion is present.
Pulmonary
vascularity is not increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 37 yo man with a history of asthma who presented
with progressive hypoxia.  Ddx included idiopathic lung disease,
pneumonia, PE.  Pulmonary embolism seemed unlikely given that
the patient is on DVT prophylaxis and had been having these
progressive CT changes.

HYPOXIA
He underwent diagnostic VATS on [**2189-9-25**] which he tolerated well
with minimal EBL. Chest tube was removed on the morning of
[**2189-9-26**].  Intial pathology read was consistant with Hamman-[**Doctor First Name **]
syndrome.  He was started solumedrol 250 mg q6 on [**9-24**].
On the floor he required 3-6L NC to keep his sats >93%. On the
morning of MICU transfer ([**9-27**]) he was rolling to his side to use
a bedside urinal and had increased hypoxia with O2sats ~85%. He
was placed on a NRB with improvement in his sats and subjective
feeling of dyspnea. A repeat CXR was done. He received an
empiric dose of lasix (20 mg IV x1) with adequate urine output.
He had transient improvement in oxygenation and was transferred
to the MICU on NRB.
In the MICU his oxygen saturation was supported 50-80 % facemask
with waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] requirement.  Pressure support
ventilation was not required.
Combivent nebs given Q6 PRN.

POSSIBLE INFECTION
Given then patient's tenuous residual lung function and acute
decompensation, he was also started on emperic pneumonia
treatment with Vanc/Levo on [**9-23**].  Cultures were negative for
AFB, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 14616**], bacteria.  His vanc was discontinued on
[**2189-9-24**] and restarted on [**2189-9-27**].  He was placed on prophylactic
Bactrim while on high dose steroids.

TRANSFER TO [**Hospital1 112**]
When path returned as consistent with AIP, we discussed his case
with the transplant service at our sister hospital, [**Name (NI) **], as well as with their critical care team.  We arranged
for urgent transfer for expedited evaluation for possible
transplantation, since we felt that this provided the best
balance of risks and benefits.
