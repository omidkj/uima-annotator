Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was found to have a 3 cm opening in his right groin
with exposed graft, significant purulence around the graft, a
medial stump wound with purulent drainage and culture results
consistent with enterococcus.  He was placed on linezolid,
cipro,and flagyl.  The graft was excised and the wound was
drained.  He then went back to the OR to have further
debridement of his right thigh, sartorius flap, VAC dressing
placement. The following week he went to the OR for VAC removal
and groin washout and closure.  During his hospital stay he was
seen to be grossly aspirating with symptoms of nausea, emesis,
shortness of breath, and hypoxia after eating. He was made NPO
and bedside swallow evals did not see signs of oropharyngeal
aspiration although a gastrograffin swallow did show
oropharyngeal reflux and a weak LES. A dophoff tube was placed
although discussions with the patient and his family determined
that the patient would be unlikely to want a permanent form of
supplemental feeding. On [**7-5**], he had an episode of chest pain
and a tropnin leak to .2.  He had persistent hyponatremia that
was treated with lasix, fluid restriction, and salt tabs. On
[**7-7**] in the morning, he became bradycardic from 80 to 30 and
then his heart stopped and he passed away. He was DNR/DNI and no
interventions were attempted.
