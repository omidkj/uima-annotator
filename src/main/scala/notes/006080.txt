History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 68459**] is a 50F with HCV cirrhosis, DM, and adrenal
insufficiency who presents with altered mental status. Of note,
she was just recently admitted [**Date range (1) 66383**] with the same
complaints, felt at that time to be due to hepatic
encephalopathy and she cleared on rifaximin and lactulose. Her
spironolactone was initially held in setting of hyponatremia to
125, but restarted at discharge. She was also restarted on
prophalactic bactrim at discharge for her history of LE
cellulitis.
.
Per discussion, mother thought she was still confused, weak,
unsteady on feet, and disoriented. She would fall asleep in the
middle of eating. Had a unwitnessed fall 4am on Sunday. Patient
was taking her rifaximin and lactulose, had two BMs yesterday.

99.8. Blood sugars were under good control 100's, as low as 78
good for her.

16 O2 93% on RA. Fingerstick glucose was 98. Serum Na was 112,
down from 137 on [**4-27**], WBC 14k. CT head was negative. Abdominal
ultrasound showed a patent TIPS and NO ascites. Wrist films
showed ?periosteal reaction. Blood cultures were obtained, but
no antibiotics given Mental status wakes to sternal rub. 84

with liver fellow.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 50F with hepatitis C cirrhosis, DM, and secondary adrenal
insufficiency with recent hospitalization for hepatic
encephalopathy returns with altered mental status and is found
to be profoundly hyponatremic now called out from MICU.
.
#)Altered mental status: Improved throughout admission, likely
multi-factorial including, hyponatremia, hypercalcemia, hepatic
encephalopathy, and multiple sedating meds. No other signs of
decompenstation such as ascites to tap. No evidence of GIB.
Electrolytes improved with repletion. Tolerated PO now, blood
and urine cultures NGTD. Held neurontin but restated prior to
admisison. Cont rifaximin and lactulose. She was AAOX3 prior to
discharge.
.
#)Hyponatremia: 112 on admission, improved with NS. 130 upon
discharge. Likely [**1-8**] poor PO intake in setting of restarting
spironolactone at too high a dose. Restarted
lasix/spironolactone at half doses.
.
#)?Aspiration Pneumonia: patient had leukocytosis on admission,
improved without fever right lower lobe opacity seen on CXR.
Patient with new nonproductive cough. Treated with 5 day course
of levo/flagyl plus nebs for aspiration pneumonia. Blood, Urine,
NGTD. Legionella negative.
.
#)Cirrhosis: C/b encephalopathy, MELD 16 upon admission,
continued rifaximin and lactulose at increased dose, trended
LFTs, INR, restarted Bactrim ppx once levo/flagyl finishes.
.
#)Hypercalcemia: Improved.  Free ionized calcium normal this am.
Has been ongoing,(seen in endocrinology clinic and thought to be
[**1-8**] high doses of calcitriol). Patient was hypercalcemic at last
admit, with improvement with holding calcium supplements per DC
summary. PTH appropriately down at 13. Continued to hold
calcium/D, should be monitored by endocrine/PCP.
.
#)Ileus: [**Month (only) 116**] have had in setting of narcotics, poor PO intake
and electrolyte abnormalities. NGT placed but once she tolerated
PO with +BS and stool output, d/ced it.
.
#)Wrist pain: Question of wrist fracture on plain films that was
re-read as unlikely to be fracture. Pt with known osteoporosis.
Continued splint per [**Month (only) **]
.
#)Thrombocytopenia: [**1-8**] spenomegaly/sequestration, remained at
baseline in 40-60s, monitored
.
#)DM: Covered with insulin sliding scale, diabetic diet
.
#)Adrenal insufficiency: continued home prednisone in addition
to adding florinef for mineralicorticoids.
.
#)Asthma: Continued home inhalers
.
#)Chronic pain: continued home narcotics at a smaller dose
.
#)General Care: FEN: low sodium diet, follow and replete elytes,
Access 2PIV, PPX: PPI, boots, strict aspiration precautions,
Dispo: pending electrolyte repletion, Code: full, Comm with
