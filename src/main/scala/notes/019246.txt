similar episode in the past.  He had some postepisode

on a labetalol drip.  In general he was well nourished and in
no acute distress.  Neck was supple.  Lungs were clear to
auscultation.  Cardiovascular was regular rate and rhythm.
Neurologic examination through translator showed his mental
status to be awake and alert, intermittently cooperative with
examination but withdrawn affect, oriented to person and
place, this hospital, month and year.  He was inattentive,
could not test months of the year backward or forward.  He
would not answer.  Language was difficult to assess.  He was
fluent with no dysarthria per translator.  There were some
paraphrasic errors and naming was intact of thumb, fingers
and pen.  He could repeat without difficulty.  Fund of
knowledge was difficult to assess.  Memory could not be
assessed.  [**Location (un) **] and writing - he was capable of [**Location (un) 1131**]
and writing in French.  Cranial nerves - visual fields seemed
diminished in right visual field with decreased blink to
threat.  Pupils were equally round and reactive to light, 3
to 2.5 mm, sluggish bilaterally.  Extraocular movements were
intact, no nystagmus, breakdown or saccadic movements.
Facial sensation could not be assessed and facial movement
with right lower droop.  Hearing was intact grossly.  Tongue
was midline with no fasciculations.  Sternocleidomastoid
muscle and trapezius were normal bilaterally but
impersistent.  Motor examination showed normal bulk and tone
bilaterally, no tremor, no pronator drift, could not test
individual muscle group due to lack of cooperation.  He was
extremely impersistent and would not follow.  He had no
pronator drift.  His IP seemed full and symmetric
bilaterally.  We could not test the upper extremities.  He
was moving all extremities symmetrically.  Sensation was
withdraw to pain bilaterally.  Reflexes were 2 throughout,
[**2-12**] in the plantar, grasp reflex was absent.  Toes were
upgoing on the right, equivocal on the left.  Coordination -
we tried to touch examine his finger but he had difficulty
understanding questions.  The family had left prior to being
able to test further.  Gait was not tested.

LABORATORY DATA:  Chem-7 showed sodium of 147, potassium 3.6,
chloride 107, bicarbonate 13, BUN 96, creatinine 12.1,
glucose 12.5.  Toxicology screen was negative.  White count
was 12.5, hematocrit 28.5, platelet count 230, PT 13.4, PTT
25.4, INR 1.2.

CT of his brain showed a 2.6 cm left temporo-occipital
hemorrhage.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the neurology
service initially to the intensive care unit.  He was loaded
on Dilantin and then given 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.  His hemorrhage
remained stable across multiple serial images, did not
increase on an MR that was repeated and he will have an MR
repeated as an outpatient to follow his hemorrhage.

On hospital day number three the patient's hematocrit went
down to 23.  He was transfused with one unit of packed red
cells and as a result went into pulmonary edema with
impressive increase in interstitial lung markings.  He was
diuresed with Lasix and started on dialysis.  He remained on
dialysis to the present time.  He has not had another
seizure.  While in the intensive care unit he was noted to
have persistent fevers.  Cultures were obtained including
urine cultures and he had a urinary tract infection which was
treated with a 14-day course of Levaquin.

The patient remained neurologically stable.  His examination
at this time shows that he has predominantly a Wernicke's
type aphasia.  There were no focal weaknesses and no visual
field cuts.  He was capable of ambulating, eating, and taking
care of his activities of daily living.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] also had quite severe hypertension during this
admission requiring control with three medications.  He is on
lisinopril, Lopressor and Norvasc at the present.  He also
required hemodialysis for renal failure and has received
multiple sessions.  The patient will be discharged home on
[**2167-7-22**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Left parieto-occipital hemorrhage.
2. Seizure disorder related to the left parieto-occipital
hemorrhage.
3. Renal failure.
4. Urinary tract infection.

It is not clear what the etiology of his intracranial
hemorrhage is, although it is felt most likely to be
hypertensive.  We will need to repeat an MRI as an outpatient
to further follow this.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lopressor 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
2. Norvasc 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Dilantin 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4. Lisinopril 50 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Calcium carbonate 500 mg p.o. t.i.d. with meals as a
phosphate binder.
6. Nephrocaps one capsule p.o. q.d.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient will follow up with myself, Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1206**] in neurology clinic.  He will also receive an
outpatient MRI on [**8-18**].  He will also follow up with
nephrology and receive outpatient hemodialysis.  The patient
needs a primary care physician.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] arrangements are being
made.
