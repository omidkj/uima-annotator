[**2154-7-26**]


History of Present Illness:
67 year old gentleman who developed shortness of breath and a
new
heart murmur roughly one year ago. A stress test was performed
which did not show ischemia however the echocardiogram revealed
mitral regurgitation. A repeat echocardiogram was peformed this
[**Month (only) 205**] which showed posterior leaflet prolapse with associated
severe mitral regurgitation. Mild left ventricular hypertrophy
was noted as well as pulmonary vein reversal. Given the severity
of his disease, he was referred for surgical evaluation. He is
symptomatic with fatigue, occasional lightheadedness, dyspnea on
exertion and some mild exertional chest heaviness.

global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: No atheroma in ascending aorta. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Mildly thickened
aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. Trace AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate/severe MVP. Torn mitral chordae. [**Male First Name (un) **] of the mitral
chordae (normal variant). No resting LVOT gradient. Severe (4+)
MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized.
No PS. Physiologic PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
PREBYPASS:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global
systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
moderate/severe P3 leaflet mitral valve prolapse. Torn mitral
chordae are present. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
POSTBYPASS:
The patient is on a low dose phenyleprine infusion.
Biventricular function is preserved.
There is a well-seated Mitral Annuloplasty ring noted. There is
no mitral stenosis or regurgitation. There is no periprosthesis
leak detected.
The previously noted trace aortic regurgitation is unchanged.
The aorta remains intact post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2154-7-26**] Mr.[**Known lastname 7749**] was taken to the operating room and underwent
Mitral Valve repair (Gortex neo cord/#30 physio 2 ring) with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please see operative report for further surgical
details. He tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to
the CVICU intubated and sedated. He awoke neurologically intact
and was extubated without difficulty. He weaned off pressor
support and was started on Beta-blocker/Statin/Aspirin and
diuresed to his preoperative weight. All lines and drains were
discontinued per protocol. He continued to progress and on POD#1
he was transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring.
Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of strength and
mobility. He did go into a rate controlled atrial fibrillation
on POD 2 and Amiodarone was not started due to heart rate in the
50-60's.  Coumadin was started on 9.4 and the patient was given
5 mg/1 mg/0.5 mg for INR goal 2.0-2.5.  INR on [**7-29**] was 2.0->2.6
on [**7-30**].  Amiodarone was started on [**7-30**] with patient remaining in
atrial fibrillation heart rate 80's and fully anticoagulated.
Amiodarone weaning to be determined by cardiologist Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]. The
remainder of his hospital course was essentially uneventful. He
was cleared for discharge to home on POD 4 with VNA services.
All follow up appointments were advised.
