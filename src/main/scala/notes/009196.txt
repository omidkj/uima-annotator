RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2155-10-27**] 8:04 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: ?Pre-op

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
83 year old woman with sob o2 sat 84% on room air now stable
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
?Pre-op
INDICATION: An 83-year-old woman with shortness of breath,
question preop.

COMPARISON: [**2155-10-24**].

FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph demonstrates a
left pleural effusion which has increased in size. There is a
persistent left retrocardiac opacity. There is a new focal
opacity in the right middle lobe which obscures the right heart
border. While this was not present on the most recent prior
examination, enhancement seen on other prior studies and is most
likely an area of recurrent atelectasis, however, a developing
pneumonia cannot be excluded at this site. The cardiac and
mediastinal contours are unchanged.

IMPRESSION:
1. New right middle lobe opacity either representing atelectasis
versus developing pneumonia.
2. Left pleural effusion which appears to have increased in size
and associated persistent left retrocardiac density.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT  [**2155-10-25**] 10:59 AM

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT

Reason: PT WITH RUE SWELLING, R/O DVT

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
83 year old woman with R arm swelling, in DIC
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
?DVT Please do at bedside, pt critically ill
RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND.

INDICATION: Right arm swelling. MDIC.

COMPARISON: None.

FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **] scale and color doppler examination of the right
jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic, and cephalic
veins demonstrates normal compressibility, color flow,
respiratory variation, and augmentation. There is no sign of
intraluminal thrombus.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of venous thrombosis.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2155-10-24**] 11:37 AM

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST

Reason: ABD PAIN
Field of view: 36

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
83 year old F with ischemic left foot, severe PVD, CHF, DIC who
initially complained of abdominal pain with elevated lactate,
now stable for CT.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
?PLEASE R/O MESENTERIC ISCHEMIANO IV CONTRAST PLEASE - ARF
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: acute renal failure

INDICATION: 83 year old with severe peripheral vascular disease,
CHF, who initially complained of abdominal pain with elevated
lactate. Assess for mesenteric ischemia. Please do not
administer IV contrast.

TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the
abdomen and pelvis following the administration of oral contrast
only. IV contrast was not administered secondary to the ordering
physician's request. Multiplanar reformatted images were also
obtained.

COMPARISON: CT abdomen/pelvis of [**2155-9-19**].

CT OF ABDOMEN W/O IV CONTRAST: The imaged portions of the lung
bases demonstrate an interval increase in the size of bilateral
pleural effusions, now large on the right and moderate on the
left. There is also increased opacification of the right middle
lobe, with intervening air bronchograms. There is stable
cardiomegaly with prominence of the right atrium. The liver,
gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are
not significantly changed in appearance, allowing for the
noncontrast aspect of this exam. There is a new small amount of
perihepatic ascites and increased subcutaneous edema within the
soft tissues of the posterior abdomen. There is diffuse wall
calcification of the intra-abdominal aorta. Bilateral renal
artery stents are in place.

The opacified loops of large/small bowel are unremarkable in
appearance. There is no evidence of bowel obstruction, wall
thickening, or air within the bowel walls. Noted are scattered
colonic diverticulae.

CT OF PELVIS W/O IV CONTRAST: There is increased fatty
stranding/fluid density within the presacral space. The rectum,
distal loops of bowel and adnexal regions are unremarkable. A
Foley catheter is seen within a nondistended urinary bladder.

Bone windows again show diffuse degenerative changes of the
visualized spine. There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic
lesions.

Multiplanar reformatted images were helpful in confirming the
above findings. These images also show no secondary signs of
acute me
