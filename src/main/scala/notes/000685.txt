Date of Birth:   [**2117-2-1**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIAC CARE UNIT

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain for 24 hours.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 44-year-old male with sudden
onset of substernal chest pain around 9:30 pm on [**4-21**]
while working.  He reports associated shortness of breath,
nausea, but denies any lightheadedness, syncope, or back
pain.  He went to the outside hospital on [**4-22**], and was
found to have a slight troponin leak, but no
electrocardiogram changes consistent with acute ischemia, and
was started on some nitroglycerin with some relief of pain.
CT scan of the chest showed ascending aortic aneurysm of 5.5
cm without any dissections seen.  The patient was transferred
to [**Hospital1 69**] for further
evaluation and treatment.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was hemodynamically
stable.  CT scan of the contrast films from the outside
hospital was reviewed by our in-house radiologist, and showed
no signs of dissection or aortic hematoma.  Cardiothoracic
Surgery evaluated the patient and recommended aortogram,
cardiac catheterization, and transesophageal echocardiogram.

Cardiac catheterization was done showing a large ascending
aortic aneurysm, severe [**2-10**]+ aortic regurgitation, but no
aortic dissection.  The patient had clean coronary arteries,
also had a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 29.  Cardiac
output of 5.3, cardiac index of 2.3.

The transesophageal echocardiogram was done on arrival to the
Cardiac Care Unit showing bicuspid aortic valves, [**2-10**]+ aortic
insufficiency with an ejection fraction of 25-30%, borderline
dilated left ventricle, moderate left ventricular
hypertrophy, and markedly dilated ascending aorta of 5.1 cm.
Again, no aortic dissection was seen.  No aortic valve
stenosis was seen.  There are no vegetations on the
transesophageal echocardiogram that was seen.  The patient
had 1+ mitral regurgitation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, the patient had
previously been treated with Zestril, but had stopped two
years ago when he lost health insurance and since acquiring
health insurance again, he has not seen a physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has
not been restarted on any antihypertensives.

MEDICATIONS:  No medications.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No known drug history.  He lives with his
long term girlfriend.  Denies any alcohol history which is
confirmed with his girlfriend.  [**Name (NI) **] has a 30 pack year tobacco
history.  He smokes about two packs per day and is a welder.

FAMILY HISTORY:  He reports a family history of coronary
artery disease in his uncle.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient
was afebrile, heart rate 94, blood pressure 112/51,
respiratory rate 24, and 96% on 4 liters nasal cannula.  He
is a middle aged man sedated in no acute distress.  Mucous
membranes are moist, anicteric.  Jugular venous pressure was
unable to be assessed.  Heart was a regular, rate, and rhythm
with a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left upper sternal
border with 1/6 diastolic murmur with the right upper sternal
border with a left ventricular heave.  Lungs were clear to
auscultation anteriorly and laterally.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds.  There
is no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema in his extremities.  He
had 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  He was alert and
oriented times three.  Cranial nerves II through XII are
intact.  Neurologic examination is grossly nonfocal.  Left
femoral Swan-Ganz catheter was in place.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count of 10.4, hematocrit of 38.0,
platelets 161.  Sodium 138, potassium 4.3, chloride 103,
bicarbonate 23, BUN 17, creatinine 1.3, glucose 90, INR 1.2.
PTT 54.0.  Arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.34, CO2 of
44,medial and O2 of 110.  Differential on the white count:
69% neutrophils, 21% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, 3.6%
eosinophils, and 0.4% basophils.  Troponin peaked at 1.6 and
decreased thereafter.  CKs were flat ranging between 50s and
60s.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Showed normal sinus rhythm at 92 beats
per minute, left atrial enlargement, normal intervals, Q in
[**Last Name (LF) 1105**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] depressions in I and V6, J-point elevation in V1
through V3 with some ST elevations, T-wave inversion in I and
L, V4 through V6, left ventricular hypertrophy by criteria.

CHEST X-RAY:  Widen mediastinum with mild congestive heart
failure, small left pleural effusion.

CT scan from the outside hospital showed a 5.5 cm descending
aortic aneurysm with no dissection or hematoma.

Urine culture showed skin flora.  Urinalysis was negative.
Blood cultures were negative at the time of discharge.

A transthoracic echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of
25-30% with ascending aorta of 5.8 cm.  Trivial mitral
regurgitation, 3+ aortic regurgitation, and minimal aortic
stenosis.

The patient was admitted for treatment of his congestive
heart failure as well as close monitoring of his
hemodynamics.  He was started on Lasix and for diuresis, and
started on an ACE inhibitor for afterload reduction.  She was
weaned off his oxygen.  He had stable blood pressure.

The patient's aortic insufficiency was thought to be chronic
due to his congenital bicuspid valve.  His thoracic aneurysm
was thought to be due to his uncontrolled hypertension,
however, his RPR and ESR were sent.  ESR came back at 46, and
his RPR was unreactive.  However, the quantitative RPR in the
treatment of treponemal antibody was sent to state laboratory
and was still pending at the time of discharge.

The patient was also started on nicotine patch for his
nicotine withdrawal symptoms.  He was followed by
Cardiothoracic Surgery who felt that the patient required
surgery for valve repair and aortic aneurysm repair.  He was
scheduled for surgery in 1.5 weeks.  He remained stable, and
was discharged home with a diagnoses of aortic insufficiency,
congenital systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure,
hypertension, thoracic aortic aneurysm without rupture.

He was to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in Cardiothoracic
Surgery on [**2161-4-29**], and also with his primary care
physician.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lisinopril 10 mg q day.
2. Lasix 20 mg po q day.
3. Nicotine patch.
4. Ativan prn.
