History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 3075**] is a 72-year-old woman who underwent a right
nephrectomy several years ago for a right kidney cancer.
Unfortunately she has recurred in that
she has a large mass in the head of her pancreas which is a
metastasis from the renal cell cancer. It has eroded through the
duodenal wall and has been causing recalcitrant gastrointestinal
bleeding necessitating continual transfusions of packed red
blood cells. This is also disqualifying her from certain types
of antitumor therapy. The patient is now admitted for resection
of the lesion by Whipple pancreaticoduodenectomy.

PATHOLOGY REPORT [**2120-9-19**]
I Gallbladder and proximal jejunum (A-D):
a) Chronic cholecystitis, mild.
b) Small bowel segment, with chronic inactive inflammation. (see
note #1).

II Pancreas, Whipple procedure (E-Y):
1. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma, 6.7 cm, involving the
duodenum and pancreas (see note #2).
2.All resection margins are free of tumor.
3. Five regional lymph nodes, no malignancy identified (0/5).
4. Small foci of inactive chronic pancreatitis.
5. Rare focus of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN,
grade I).
6. Chronic focally active duodenitis (see note #1).

Note:
1. The duodenal and jejunal mucosa show chronic inflammation
with marked villous shortening, probably related to stasis and
bacterial proliferation. Other causes including celiac disease
should also be considered.

2. The tumor morphology is consistent with that of a
conventional (clear cell) renal cell carcinoma. Approximately
60% of the tumor cells have granular eosinophilic cytoplasm.
Approximately 15% of the tumor showed spindle cells
(sarcomatoid) growth. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 9885**] reviewed the tumor slides.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted on the day of surgery after undergoing
pre-admission testing previously.  The patient underwent a
Whipple procedure for excision of the mass in the head of her
pancreas.  She tolerated the procedure well and was extubated
post-op.  She was followed as per typical Whipple clinical
pathway.  She remained NPO with an NG tube in place and was on
bed rest immediately post-op.  The patient was out of bed
beginning POD#2.  The NG tube, epidural catheter, and the foley
were removed on POD#3.  The patient was pain controlled with a
PCA after the epidural was d/c'd.  The patient was seen by
physical therapy on POD#3 and followed the patient throughout.
The patient's central line was d/c's on POD#4 and the patient
was started on sips of clear liquids.  The diet was advanced to
clear liquids on POD#5 and Reglan was started.  Her JP drain was
pulled on the evening of POD#5.  The patient began to feel some
abdominal discomfort later that night.  She continued to feel
abdominal discomfort the following day and she required fluid
boluses for blood pressure control on the night of POD#[**7-16**].  She
then began to develop abdominal pain, with a CT scan on the
morning of [**9-26**] that demonstrated that she was leaking on
the basis of a presumed enteric dehiscence from either the
pancreatic, biliary or duodenojejunostomy anastomoses. She was
emergently returned to the operating room on [**9-26**]. While she
required quite a bit of fluid before she went into the operating
room, she was reasonably stable hemodynamically but had a low
urine output and the operation was performed on an emergency
basis. A revision of the pancreaticojejunostomy was performed
and a feeding G-J tube was placed.  Antibiotics were started
(Vanco, Levo, Flagyl) for positive cultures from the OR (strep
viridans, enterococcus, & gram-negative rods).  The patient was
transferred to the SICU post-op and remained there until [**2120-10-12**].
 She failed extubation on the first attempt [**10-4**].  This was
likely due to pulmonary edema from overall total body fluid
overload.  She self-extubated on [**10-7**].  She was diuresed
aggressively while in the SICU.  After extubation she remained
stable but had one episode of respiratory distress manifested by
an acute desaturation which was possibly an episode of flash
pulmonary edema.  She was continued on diuresis and did well
after this episode.  She also had a very brief episode of Afib
and was started on an amiodarone drip on [**10-9**].  She swiftly
converted back to normal sinus and remained stable thereafter on
PO amiodarone.  Cycled cardiac enzymes at that time were
negative and an echo performed later was unchanged from previous
reports with a normal LVEF.  She was seen by ophthomology and
neurology for a visual field deficit and was noted to have a
condition compared to [**Doctor Last Name 4116**] syndrome.  A head CT revealed
bilateral effacement of the occipital sulci.  MRI showed
bilateral occipital signal abnormalities consistent with
posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.  An MRA as well as
bilateral carotid ultrasound showed no pathology.  The patient
will need to be followed by neurology for this finding as an
outpatient.  The patient was transferred to the floor on [**10-12**] and
continued to progress.  She was tolerating a regular diet,
ambulating, and had normal bowel function upon discharge.
