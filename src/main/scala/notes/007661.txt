Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This [**Age over 90 **] year old male presents with shortness of breath.

He has a history of congestive heart failure with EF of 35%,
coronary artery disease with most recent PCI in [**3-/2116**] w/ DES in
proximal
LAD and stent in RCA, atrial fibrillation, and a history of
abdominal aortic aneurysm (dimensions unknown).

He presents with several weeks of shortness of breath that is
more significant than his baseline dyspnea, characterized by
long pauses between sentences.  He has been instructed to use
oxygen at night but does not do so.  On morning prior to
admission, his visiting nurse noted an O2 sat of 78% with atrial
fibrillation to rates in the 150s.  He presented to the ED.  In
the ED he was initially placed on a non-rebreather which was
quickly weaned to 2 L NC.  Saturations were near 100%.  Chest
x-ray revealed no pulmonary edema; lower extremities were not
edematous.  A hematocrit was obtained at 24% which is 10 points
below his normal - 5 days ago his HCT was 32%.  Over the past
several months, his MCV has decreased and his platelet count has
trended up.  He has been constipated for the past week until
this morning when he had a milk of magnesia enema; he moved lots
of stool but unclear if blood was noted.

Also of note - he has been having difficulty swallowing water -
such that he feels it gets stuck halfway down his esophagus, at
times causing him to choke or regurgitate.  He no longer
swallows solids.  These symptoms have been present for > 1 week
but probably less than 1 month.  For this reason, he has been
eating canned soups with high salt load - his shortness of
breath has worsened over this period with intermittent orthopnea
and lower extremity edema.

Recently he was in the CCU for IV diuresis - he was discharged
on an increased dose of lasix and his lisinopril was held in the
setting of hypotension; a beta blocker was also considered given
his PACs which were potentially contributing to his hypotension
however this was held because of his recent hypotension as well.


Currently upon transfer to the MICU he is feeling well, with no
dyspnea that he reports, although between sentences he must
pause.  Denies orthopnea, PND, lower extremity swelling,
syncope, dizziness, chest pressure or palpitations.  No cough,
hemoptysis, hematemesis, melena, abdominal pain.  Review of
systems only positive as above (dysphagia, resolved
constipation, intermittent shortness of breath).

His vitals at time of transfer are BP of 78/40, HR 120, RR 16,
O2 sat 95% on 2 L, and temp 98.

INTERPRETATION: This [**Age over 90 **] year old man with a PMH of old MI, PCI,
AS,
CHF, DM2 and AF was referred to the lab for evaluation of aortic
valve
function. The patient was infused with 5 mcg/kg/min of
dobutamine over
4.5 minutes as was stopped for achieving target workload. No
arm, neck,
back or chest discomfort was reported by the patient throughout
the
study. There were no significant ST segment changes during the
infusion
or in recovery. The rhythm was sinus with frequent isolated
apbs, vpbs
and several ventricular couplets. Appropriate hemodynamic
response to
low dose dobutamine infusion.
IMPRESSION: No symptoms, ischemic EKG changes or sustained
ectopy.
Echo report will be sent separately.

DSE:
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
20-25%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area
<0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]

IMPRESSION: Severely depressed left ventricular systolic
function - only the basal segments have appreciable systolic
function. The aortic valve is likely severely stenotic. Prior to
dobutamine gradient across the valve was as high as 60mm Hg peak
and 33mm Hg mean after an atrial premature contraction with
consequent prolonged ventricular filling. This suggested that
the valve was intrinsically stenotic. This was confirmed with
low-dose dobutamine when average LVOT velocities increased from
0.5 m/s to 0.7m/s and average AV velocities from 2.7m/s to
3.5m/sec. Again, after a VPC, peak gradient was as high as 73 mm
Hg and mean 41mm Hg.
