History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old man transferred from LGH with
hemoptysis. He has a history of both primary lung and colon
cancer. He last received chemotherapy one month ago. Over the
past couple of days he has been very fatigued and developed a
cough. He was prescribed prednisone and an antibiotic. His
symptoms worsened. Today he walked into the hospital and
syncopized. He was emergently intubated where a clot "the size
of a fist" was found. He was noted to be hypotensive during the
intubation with propofol. He received one unit in transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED here he received another unit. He had a CTA which
showed bilateral ground glass opacities, but no PE. IP was
consulted and plan to bronch him in the AM.

IMAGING:
[**2182-7-10**] CXR:
1. Left subclavian line ends in the very proximal SVC.
2. No pneumothorax.
3. Multifocal ground-glass opacities, likely hemorrhage or
aspiration.
.
[**2182-7-10**] CT Torso:
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Diffuse ground-glass opacity most pronounced in the lower
lobes likely represent aspiration.
3. Right hilar mass with a right upper lobe medial lung apex
opacity with imaging findings of post radiation
pnumonitis/atelectasis. Findings suggest lung primary rateher
than metastasis to which we have history of. Please correlate
with history.
3. Multiple pulmonary and innumerable liver metastases.
4. Mass-like mass in the rectum and extension into the
mesorectum might represent the patient's primary colon cancer
.
[**2182-7-13**] CXR: There has been removal of the endotracheal tube
and the right IJ central line. There is a left-sided central
venous catheter with distal lead tip in the proximal SVC. There
is increased opacification within the left lung apex. There are
areas of consolidation within the left lung, stable. The right
lung base appears relatively well aerated. Heart size is within
normal limits. There are no pneumothoraces.


Brief Hospital Course:
55 year old man with colon and lung cancer who presented with
hemoptysis and underwent right main bronchial artery
embolization with resolution of his hemorrhage.
.
# Hemoptysis: Patient initially presented to an OSH where he was
emergently intubated after coughing up a "fist sized" clot of
blood and transferred for advanced pulmonary and radiology
thearpy. Bronchoscopy revealed a RMS endobronchial lesion that
was biopsied with cold forceps. A BAL of the RUL was done and
this was immediately followed by massive bleeding from the RUL
posterior segment. The patient then underwent a right main
bronchial artery embolization by IR on [**7-12**] and was successfully
extubated on [**7-12**] with small amount of hemoptysis afterward.  He
was transferred from the MICU to the general medical [**Hospital1 **] where
he remained stable for 48 hours after extubation prior to
discharge without recurrence of hemoptysis.
.
# Fever: Febrile on arrival to the MICU. He was empirically
treated with vanc and zosyn which was then narrowed to
levofloxacin he was discharged to complete a 5 day course of
antibiotics for a possible CAP given scattered opacities seen on
chest imaging. All blood cultures and urine cultures were
negative. Stool was negative for C. diff.
.
# COLON AND LUNG CANCER:  stable except as above, patient was
noted to have extensive metastatic disease as seen on imaging
performed at this hospital, but without comparison to outside
imaging.  patient seemed unware of the extent of his disease nor
his prognosis.  a discussion was had with his primary oncologist
who would review the imaging from [**Hospital1 18**] and appropriately
counsel his patient given any new findings seen on new imaging.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
-patient's code status should be readdressed
-new and old imgaging need to be reconciled to assess degree of
metastatic disease

Discharge Instructions:
It was a pleasure taking care of you while you were admitted to
[**Hospital1 69**].  You were transfered from
[**Hospital6 3105**] after losing consciouness in the
emergency department.  You were found to be cough up a large
amount of blood and were transfered for skilled care.  You were
intubated and had a machine breath for you.  You underwent a
procedure to stop the blood flow to the bleeding part of your
lung called a guided bronchial artery embolization.  You
tolerated this well without ongoing bleeding and were extubated.
 You were discharged to follow up with your oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 112029**]
[**Name (STitle) 22658**], MD.

The following changes were made to your medications:
-Start levofloxacin 750 mg daily for 5 additional days

You can call 1-[**Telephone/Fax (1) 70946**] to help find an onoclogist if you
