Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 16983**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
paracentesis


History of Present Illness:
HPI:
.
The patient is a 61 year old male with a history of a recently
diagnosed by CT scan of the chest on [**2187-5-15**] RCC measuring 15
x 4 x 13.8 cm with extensive metastatic disease including
extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, multiple pulmonary
nodules, bone mets, ascites, and soft tissue attenuation within
the region of the greater omentum suspicious for peritoneal
carcinomatosis on Sutent chemotherapy who presented to the ER on
[**2187-7-14**] with the chief complaint of lightheadedness, dizziness
and increased shortness of breath.
.
The patient has had a chronic cough since [**11-27**] but over the
past 5 weeks has noted increased shortness of breath which he
dismissed as he felt better on Sutent (Tyrosine Kinase
Inhibitor) for his RCC. However, he noted the day prior to
admission, while walking to his attorney's office, that he could
not walk 350 feet approximately without having to stop twice for
shortness of breath. This is a clear change from his baseline
which is unlimited. He denies any chest pain, no radiation to
his left arm, back or jaw. No diaphoresis. He denies any weight
gain or lower extremity edema. No calf pain. However, he does
report increased orthopnea within the past few weeks. He does
admit to having blood-tinged sputum. The patient states that in
the ER, he had approximately a table-spoon of hemoptysis.
.
Also, the patient reports a 3 week history of yellow colored
"diarrhea" with poor PO intake and fatigue. His definition of
diarrhea is [**1-23**] small bowel movements ranging from loose to
watery in nature that began when he started antibiotics in [**Month (only) 547**]
for a presumed pneumonia. The day prior to presentation, he had
non-bilious emesis x 3 which he felt was secondary to the
chemotherapy.
.
He also reports lightheadedness, dizziness, no syncope or
presyncope. As his breathing was worse and he felt lightheaded,
he called his oncologist who referred him to the ED. Of note,
the patient takes atenolol, lisinopril and triamterene/HCTZ at
baseline and was taking these until 2 days ago as he felt his BP
might be low.
.
In the ER, the patient's lactate was found to be 3.8 and 3.9 in
the setting of known malignancy which oncology felt was not
necessarily indicative of infection. His SBP on presentation 70
systolic. The patient had 2 18 gauge peripheral IVs placed and
was given a total of 3 liters of IVF with a systolic blood
pressure in the low 100s.
.
The patient was also found to have acute renal failure with a Cr
of 3.9 (baseline Cr 1.6-1.9) and BUN of 59. Na 132. CK 130, MB
10, MBI 7.7, troponin 0.10. His Hct was 40 (baseline 36-43) and
on rectal had gross blood around the rectum with a history of
internal/external hemorrhoids.
.
In addition to IVF, the patient was given vanc/levo/flagyl
empirically for ?sepsis with no clear source on CXR although
there was a suspicion for ?RLL infiltrate on CXR by the ED.
.
Cardiology was consulted in the ED for a stat echo to assess for
RV strain with concern for PE in the setting of dyspnea but it
was unclear at the time if it was necessary.
.
His EKG showed:
.
NSR at 83 bpm. NL axis. Low voltage. QTC 412 ms. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] in I, Q
in lead III. TW flattening II, III, AVF, I, AVL, V4-V6. No
baseline for comparison.
.
Given his acute renal failure, the patient was unable to obtain
a CT-A and given his metastatic disease, a VQ scan was felt to
be unhelpful as well. Oncology requested that if his BP resolved
with IVF, that heparin not be initiated unless clearly
indicated. However, the patient did have bilateral lower
extremity dopplers which showed:
.
1.  Acute thrombus within the left common femoral vein which is
nonocclusive.
2.  No evidence of DVT within the right lower extremity.
3.  Evidence of ascites.
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient's SBP was 89/65 systolic. He
was sat'ing 97% on 3 liters NC with no apparent respiratory
distress.
.
ROS:
.
16 pound weight loss over past year with increased abdominal
girth. No fevers/chills. No headaches but change in vision over
past few weeks. The patient had been hospitalized at [**Hospital 42317**]
Hospital in [**4-28**] for ?pneumonia for which he was treated with
levaquin and had a chest CT which diagnosed the RCC with mets.
Positive burning with urination. Bright red blood per rectum
only with wiping. No history of bloody stools.
.
