History of Present Illness:
56 YO F with DM1 c/b multiple episodes of DKA, polyneuropathy
and gastroparesis, HCV genotype 1A, [**Doctor Last Name 933**] disease, and
hypertension who presented to the ED due to confusion. Per the
ED resident the patient's daughter reported that the patient had
not been taking her meds for the past couple of days. Her
daughter called her earlier on the day of admission and noted
that she was confused so called EMS who brought the patient into
the ED.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, her VS were: 96.1  115  134/72  42
100%3L. She was triggered upon arrival to the ED due to her poor
mental status. She c/o nausea, SOB and CP with recent flare of
gastroparesis with unknown last BM. Exam was notable for an
irritable female oriented to self. Labs were notable for initial
glucose > than assay, K 7.6; chem 7 revealed glucose 1369, Na
121, K 6.0, bicarb 8, creat 2.2, gap 34. UA was notable for
glucose and ketones. EKG was notable for ST segment elevation in
V1-V2. A Code STEMI was called and the patient was given asa,
plavix 300mg, heparin bolus, integrillin bolus as well as
started on an insulin drip with bolus of 10u and rate of 8u. She
was also given a total of 4.5L NS. A left femormal line was
placed. Of note, placement was complicated by an arterial
puncture. EKG was repeated after insulin drip was started with
improvement in the ST segments. Cardiology therefore felt the
changes were [**2-22**] hyperkalemia in the setting of hyperglycemia
and suggested stopping heparin and integrillin and continuing
treatment of DKA.
.
Repeat labs were notable for glucose 1135, K 4.1, bicarb 5,
creatinine 2.2 and an anion gap of 34.
.
The patient is not able to provide additional history at this
time. She is oriented to place and situation but is quite
somnolent. She c/o abdominal pain but denies ongoing CP or SOB.
.
Of note, she was recently admitted in the end of [**Month (only) 116**] for DKA
