[**2146-5-4**] CT scan abdomen/pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1. Free intraperitoneal air seen under the right hemidiaphragm,
in the right paracolic gutter, as well as in the pelvis.
Multiple sigmoid diverticuli are seen, with mild diverticulitis.
2. Unchanged ventral fat-containing hernias.
3. Gallbladder sludge/stones.
Findings discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] following completion
of the study.

[**2146-5-4**] Sigmoid pathology
-   Segment of colon with diverticulitis and evidence of
perforation with acute serositis.
-   Margins are unremarkable.

[**2146-5-4**] EKG
Atrial flutter with 2:1 block. The morphology is atypical
counterclockwise
however, the cycle length is long. Intraventricular conduction
delay. ST-T wave abnormalities. Since the previous tracing of
[**2146-3-16**] the rate is somewhat slower but probably the same blocked
interval.

[**2146-5-5**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. There is mild volume overload.
2. Unchanged chronic right middle lobe consolidation and
post-surgical changes in the left lower lobe.
3. Improved left lower lobe aeration with persistent moderate
retrocardiac atelectasis.

[**2146-5-7**] CXR
Still present right middle lobe atelectasis has decreased in the
short-term interval. There is no significant change in left
lower lobe areas of plate-like atelectasis. Small bilateral
pleural effusion is unchanged. The cardiomediastinal silhouette
is stable.

The right internal jugular line tip terminates at cavoatrial
junction. The pacemaker leads terminate in the right atrium and
right ventricle. There is no evidence of congestive heart
failure.

[**2146-5-12**] CT abd/pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1. Fluid is seen within the peritoneal cavity as detailed above.
No specific evidence of an organized abscess is seen.
2. Small pleural fluid is seen bilaterally.
3. Prominence of the endometrial stripe as noted above for which
an ultrasound is recommended for further evaluation given the
patient's age. This finding was placed on the notification of
critical radiology findings dashboard at the time of dictation.

[**2146-5-12**] EKG
Atrial fibrillation. Incomplete left bundle-branch block.
Inferior and
lateral ST-T wave changes are non-specific. Low QRS voltage in
the limb leads. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2146-5-11**]
there is no significant change.

[**2146-5-13**] KUB
IMPRESSION: Distended and dilated loops of bowel most consistent
with ileus.

[**2146-5-16**] CXR
IMPRESSION: Mild bibasilar atelectasis, without evidence of
acute volume overload.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was seen in the ED by surgery and cardiology and taken
emergently to the OR for perforated diverticulum.  A left
colectomy, colostomy, and [**Last Name (un) 85571**] pouch was done.  She was
transferred to the PACU.  Written for She was on perioperative
kefzol and flagyl for 48 hours.  She was reintubated emergently
in the PACU for acute respiratory distress.  CXR showed a right
middle lobe collapse.  She had a bronchoscopy done with removal
of her mucous plug and respiratory status was stabilized.
Troponins were negative and EKG done at time of acute
respiratory distress showed no ST changes.  Cx from mucous plug
was negative for pathologic organisms.  She was extubated and
her O2 sat was 98% on 2L nasal cannula.  She was put on
amiodarone drip for persistent atrial fibrillation and was on
low dose neo temporarily to maintain MAP >60.  Albumin was
started to maintain her blood pressure and she was restarted on
her Coumadin.

On POD 2 her amio gtt was stopped and she was back on her home
amio dose.  She had a slight bump in her creatinine to 1.7 and
so her lasix was held. On POD 3 she had afib/aflutter and was
given lopressor x 3 as well as restarted on the amio gtt.  NGT
was placed and had a 1300cc return.  She was transitioned to
amiodarone twice daily and was stabilized. Her NGT was clamped
and was re
