Admission Date:  [**2116-9-14**]     Discharge Date:  [**2116-9-18**]

Date of Birth:   [**2082-3-28**]     Sex:  F

Service:  MICU-A

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 34-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for asthma,
obstructive sleep apnea, morbid obesity, and migraine
headaches who presented with a 2-day history of headaches
similar in nature to her previous migraines and a subjective
fever times one day.

The patient states that her current headaches are frontal,
increasing in intensity, and associated with neck and back
pain; similar to past migraine headaches.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Pertinent positives on review of systems
included diarrhea times two days three days prior to
admission (no blood, no mucous) which resolved spontaneously.
No increased secretions along her tracheostomy.  No
tenderness at the tracheostomy site.  No change in ventilator
settings.  She denies dysuria or sick contacts.  Of note, the
patient was discharged in [**2116-3-28**] with similar symptoms
of [**11-6**] frontal headaches as well as fevers.  No lumbar
puncture was successfully completed secondary to her morbid
obesity, and the patient defervesced and was discharged
following a 2-day hospitalization.  The patient went home
with a peripherally inserted central catheter to complete a
course of intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone for possible
meningitis.  She also completed a course of Keflex for a left
lower extremity cellulitis.  She was most recently
hospitalized from [**4-28**] to [**4-30**] for a left lower
extremity cellulitis presumably secondary to incomplete
treatment.  She was discharged to home with dicloxacillin to
complete a 14-day course of treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Asthma; status post intubation with tracheostomy
placement on [**2114**].
2.  Obstructive sleep apnea (on home [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway
pressure).
3.  Morbid obesity (plan for gastric bypass surgery in the
next several months).
4.  History of migraine headaches.
5.  Anemia (with a baseline hematocrit of 25 to 27).
6.  Anxiety.
7.  Depression.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Paxil.
2.  Lasix 80 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Albuterol.

96 to 116, her respiratory rate was in the 20s, and her
oxygen saturation was 96% to 98% on assist-control 700/15/40%
with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.  In general,
the patient was alert and oriented times three.  She spoke in
full sentences and appeared in no apparent distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination revealed the patient
was normocephalic and atraumatic.  The pupils were equally
round and reactive to light and accommodation.  The
oropharynx was clear.  Neck examination revealed no
lymphadenopathy noted.  The neck was supple.  Negative
Kernig.  Tracheostomy site with mild erythema.  No discharge
or induration.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular
rate and rhythm.  A 2/6 systolic murmur.  Normal first heart
sounds and second heart sounds.  Pulmonary examination
revealed coarse breath sounds.  No rales or rhonchi.  The
abdominal examination revealed normal active bowel sounds.
The abdomen was soft and nontender.  Extremity examination
revealed 1+ pitting edema in the calves.  No erythema or
asymmetry noted.  Dorsalis pedis pulses were equal
bilaterally.  Neurologic examination was nonfocal.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  The patient's
white blood cell count was 14.6, her hematocrit was 33.6, and
her platelets were 252.  Differential revealed 93%
neutrophils, 0% bands, 4.6% lymphocytes, and 1.5% monocytes.
Chemistry-7 was within normal limits.  Urinalysis revealed
negative nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase, 0 to 2 white
blood cells, and no bacteria.
