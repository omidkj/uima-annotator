Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
VF arrest


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization
Placement of ICD

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 79807**] is a 58 year-old man who suffered a VF arrest while
jogging in a park in [**Location (un) 745**].  There were other joggers nearby
during the arrest who administered immediate CPR.  At the time
of EMS arrival, he was noted to be in VF arrest (9:43 AM); he
received a shock at 200 J and was given amiodorone 300 mg; at
that time he was found to be in asystole and CPR was continued.
A pulse was first noted at 9:49 AM; he was in sinus rhythm.  He
was intubated and cooled with ice packs in the field.
.
In the ED, he was found to be hypotensive and was given IVF
without response; he was started on neosynephrine and given ASA
325.  He was cooled to 35 degrees C and sedated on versed and
fentanyl.  He received vecuronium as muscle paralytic to prevent
shivering.
.
His ECG in the ED showed sinus bradycardia to 52 with normal
axis and LVH by voltage criteria; there were TWI in leads I and
aVL, V1-V2, a right bundaloid pattern, and a prolonged QTc to
500.

Past Medical History:
# AORTIC INSUFFICIENCY for many years.  He is followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 32963**] in cardiology at [**Hospital1 112**].  Valve replacement was
recommended in the past and he has been considering this. OSH
TTE shows 2+ AI. For several months, he has had chest pressure
and dyspnea sensation while running and has been concerned about
cardiac trouble since then.
.
# GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE


Social History:
Nonsmoker, rare EtOH, no drug use.  Married with 2 children.
Residence in [**Location (un) 745**]. Jogs for exercise on average 4-5x/wk for
total 20 mi/wk.  Works in marketing for [**Company 22916**]; job requires
frequent travel.

Family History:
Family history significant for mother with CAD and MI age 64,
father with CAD with CABG in 70s, sister with MI at age 62.

..
PHYSICAL EXAM AT DISCHARGE:
Tm 99.1, BP 132/74, HR 68, RR 20, 95% on RA
He is alert and oriented, in no acute distress.  Memory,
cognition, judgment, language and other neurological function is
back to baseline from before cardiac arrest.  Heart exam shows
RRR.  [**2-1**] blowing diastolic murmur is heard loudest at base.
Dressing is in place over left upper chest at site of ICD
placement.  Non-erythematous, non-edematous, appropriately
tender.  There is mild tenderness to palpation over precordium
where he received chest compressions.  Lungs are clear.  Abdomen
is non-tender and non-distended.  There is no lower extremity
edema.

CORONARY CATHETERIZATION ([**2170-8-7**]):
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system
demonstrated single-vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA,
LCX, and
RCA were all without angiographically-apparent flow-limiting
stenoses.
The LAD had a proximal 80% stenosis that improved to 30% after
direct
intracoronary infusion of nitroglycerine.
2.  Aortography demonstrated severe aortic regurgitation and
mild
dilatation of the ascending aorta without evidence of
dissection.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single-vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Aortic regurgitation.
..
TTE ([**2170-8-7**]):
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is normal
regional and global biventricular systolic function. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve is bicuspid.
The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The study is
inadequate to exclude significant aortic valve stenosis. Severe
(4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet
is eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mildly thickened bicuspid aortic valve with severe
eccentric aortic regurgitation directed toward the anterior
mitral leaflet. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
dilated left ventricular and preserved regional/global systolic
function. Moderately dilated aortic root. Borderline pulmonary
hypertension.
.
TEE ([**2170-8-9**]):
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No mass or thrombus is seen in the right atrium or
right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size
are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve has
three leaflets but is functionally bileaflet. Leaflets are
thickened and deformed. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. An eccentric jet of moderate to severe (3+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen. Functionally bicuspid aortic
valve with thickened leaflets and eccentric, moderate to severe
aortic regurgitation. Mildly dilated thoracic aorta.

CT HEAD ([**2170-8-7**]):
FINDINGS: There is no intra-axial or extra-axial hemorrhage,
mass effect, shift of normally midline structures, or
hydrocephalus. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved.
Ventricles, sulci and basal cisterns are unremarkable.
Structures within the posterior fossa are unremarkable. No
suspicious lytic or blastic osseous lesion is identified. There
is scattered opacification of ethmoid air cells, and thickening
of the posterior aspect of the left maxillary sinus. Visualized
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are otherwise well
aerated.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality identified.
..
CXR ([**2170-8-14**]):
FINDINGS:  There is a single chamber pacer/AICD in place with
lead terminating in the region of the right ventricle. There is
no pneumothorax.
