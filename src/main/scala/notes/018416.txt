multiple admissions and intubations for respiratory failure, not
taking meds for past 4 days, not complaint on cpap, who was
found unresponsive in lobby on the [**Hospital Ward Name **].  Code blue was

responsive to sternal rub.  Facemask was placed with O2 sats
rising to the 90s, and improvement in mental status.  Repeat [**Hospital Ward Name **]
showed persistent hypercarbic respiratory failure.  She was

TTE [**2194-2-25**]
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There
is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2193-11-13**], the right ventricle may now be more
dilated and hypokinetic (however views are suboptimal for
comparison). Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now
higher. Findings are suggestive of pulmonary embouls or other
intercurrent pulmonary process.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
This is a 63yo female PMHx COPD and CHF, multiple prior
admissions for respiratory failure, who presented w hypercarbic
respiratory failure requiring Bipap in MICU, thought to be
secondary to COPD and CHF, diuresed and started on steroid pulse
with improved respiratory status to baseline, discharged back to
[**Hospital3 **].
.
ACTIVE
# Acute sCHF and COPD Exacerbation - Patient a/w hypercarbic
respiratory failure requiring Bipap (usually on CPAP at home),
thought to be [**1-15**] CHF and COPD exacerbations.  Exacerbating
factors were potential medication non-compliance, worsening of
pulmonary HTN (noted on TTE during this hospitalization),
cigarette smoking. COPD was treated with azithro x5d and
extended prednisone taper; CHF with diuresis. She improved to
baseline respiratory status, and was cleared by PT to return to
[**Hospital3 **].  Given prior non-compliance with O2, and
recommendation from PCP in prior note, patient was not
discharged on home O2.  She was given script for prednisone
taper.  Home inhalers (spiriva, symbicort, albuterol,
fluticasone/salmeterol) were continued and patient was counseled
on smoking cessation.  Lasix dose was increased to [**Hospital1 **] dosing
for improved diuresis and will need to be followed up in
outpatient setting.
.
# Hypertension: Continued lisinopril.  Given borderline
admission blood pressure, isosorbide mononitrate was held.
Pressures remained well-controlled and it was not restarted at
discharge; could be restarted as outpatient if blood pressures
become difficult to control
.
INACTIVE
# CAD: Continued [**Last Name (LF) 99970**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], simvastatin, metoprolol
.
# DM 2: Continued metformin
.
# Depression Continued abilify and fluoxetine
.
TRANSITIONAL
1. Code status: Full code for duration of the admission
2. Pending: No labs/studied were pending at time of discharge
3. Transfer of Care: Patient reported that [**Hospital3 **]
provided at-home PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2176**].  Discharge summary faxed to
[**Hospital3 **].
4. Barriers to Care: Recurrent readmissions with respiratory
distress are concerning for potential medication non-compliance
or environmental exacerbating factor.
