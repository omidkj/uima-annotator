Allergies:
Codeine / Morphine / Ace Inhibitors

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
new onset LEFT-sided weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
86 yo RH woman with a  PMH  significant for multiple strokes,
HTN,DM II p/w with new onset LEFT-sided weakness.

This HPI is obtained through the patient's daugther ([**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 8665**]
[**Known lastname 8666**]).

Code status:  DNR/DNI HCP: [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 8666**]: Cell: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 109615**]

ED: FSG 336.

She was last seen at her baseline at midnight (0:30 am). Today
in
the early am, her daughter heard her walking in her bedroom and
started fixing her breakfast. After a while she heard her
"trying
to open the dresser". After a few minutes she heard the same
sound. Finally for a third time she heard the same noise after a
total of approximately 5 to 10 minutes.

She was found on the floor trying to stand up while reaching for
the bed with her RIGHT arm. She was mute. She did not follow any
commands. Her LEFT side of the body was limp. She did not vomit.
One eye was closed, the other gazing to the RIGHT (per
daughter).

There was some urine in the floor (she had partially removed her
diaper). Not witnessed seizure - like activity. No PMH of
seizure
events.

After her last admission in [**2155**] at [**Hospital1 18**], she has not been
admitted to any hospitals. Her daughter explains that she "feels
weird" around once per month for the past few months. Then she
checks her SBP (> 200). During those episodes she has trouble
swallowing both solids and fluids and her LEFT arm feels
heavier.
There may be a LEFT facial droop. There are no visual or sensory
complaints. Her daughter says her tongue "[**Last Name (un) 109616**] up" while
talking. However, she is able to produce speech (not slurred)
and
to understand people.  These events happened once q 4 months,
but
have become more frequent lately.

At baseline, she has been incontinent for years and wears a
diaper.
Refuses to use her walker. Refuses to take her glyburide unless
FSG > 200. Able to have a normal conversation. Able to eat on
her
own. Bathes on her own (requires help to sit down in the tub).
Does not handle money or buy groceries. She has remained at home
for two years.

Last documented stroke clinic Neurological Exam in [**2156**] (Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]: Remarkable for a slight right facial droop. Strength
5-
in R IP and KF. No pronator drift.

Last MRI/A: [**2156-1-2**]:
There are two foci of restricted diffusion in the posterior left
corona radiata/internal capsule, consistent with an acute
infarct. Again, there are multiple T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities
in the cerebral white matter bilaterally, consistent with
chronic
microvascular ischemia.
The previously noted area of restricted diffusion in the region
of the left corona radiata has resolved.
There are also T2 and FLAIR hyperintensities within the
cerebellar infarcts bilaterally.
Acute infarcts in the left corona radiata/internal capsule.
There is no area of hemodynamically significant
stenosis or
ulceration within the vertebral artery or common or internal
carotid arteries. Normal MRA of the neck.



Past Medical History:
1. Multiple prior strokes - 1st right internal capsule lacunar
infarct in [**2148**] with left hemiparesis; 2nd [**6-/2153**] post-surgical
from mitral valve replacement with R arm weakness and multiple
bilateral cerebellar infarcts; 3rd [**2153-12-20**] with right sided
weakness and a posterior left coronal radiata infarct, 4th [**1-8**]
with left corona radiata/internal capsule
2. HTN
3. DM, diet-controlled
4. hypothyroid
5. asthma
6. DJD
7. renal insufficiency

Pertinent Results:
[**2159-4-14**]: Head CT
1. Severe chronic small vessel ischemic disease, with areas of
probable old
infarction in bilateral cerebral hemispheres, basal ganglia.
Detection of
superimposed small areas of infarction is limited.
2. No intracranial hemorrhage.

[**2159-4-14**]:MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST; MRA BRAIN W/O CONTRAST; MRA NECK
W&W/O CONTRAST
Interval development of large acute infarct within the right
middle cerebral artery territory, with reduced flow within the
right middle
cerebral artery that would correlate with the presence of this
infarct, and
potentially represent an occlusive process. Multiple areas of
susceptibility
in the brain, which could reflect amyloid angiopathy, prior
small vessel
hemorrhagic infarctions, or both diagnoses. Chronic small vessel
ischemic
infarcts.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN AT TIME OF ADMISSION: 86 yo RH woman with a
PMH  significant for multiple strokes, HTN, DM II p/w with new
onset LEFT-sided neglect and mute. Her exam localizes to the
RIGHT hemisphere. Given her neglect a right MCA territory stroke
could account for this presentation. Subcortical structures such
as the pulvinar could invoke similar symptoms too. She is RH and
mute, but follows commands properly. Aphemia may localize in
some cases to the insular cortex, however i would
expect her left side to be involved if she trylu is
right-handed.Another possible diagnosis is seizure. She has
never has any events in the past, but has extensive vascular
disaese and prior strokes.  Finally, she could have PRES.

Hospital course:
#Neurology
Head CT on admission showed severe chronic small vessel ischemic
disease, with areas of probable old infarction in bilateral
cerebral hemispheres, basal ganglia.

Subsequently, MRI/A head and neck showed interval development of
large acute infarct within the right middle cerebral artery
territory, with reduced flow within the right middle cerebral
artery that would correlate with the presence of this infarct,
and potentially represent an occlusive process. Multiple areas
of susceptibility in the brain, which could reflect amyloid
angiopathy, prior small vessel hemorrhagic infarctions, or both
diagnoses. Chronic small vessel ischemic infarcts.

Due to this devastating stroke, her health care proxy made her
[**Name (NI) 3225**] (comfort measures only).
