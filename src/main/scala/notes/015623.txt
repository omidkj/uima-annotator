Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 281**]
Chief Complaint:
subglottic stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy [**12-13**], [**12-16**], [**12-17**], and [**12-23**]

History of Present Illness:
This is a 64 yo M with a PMH significant h/o morbid obesity,
DMII, GERD, HTN, and hyperlipidemia, transferred from Northeast
[**Hospital1 **] Specialty on [**2109-12-12**] for subglottic stenosis.  The pt
apparently developed PNA in winter of [**2108**] with a lengthy stay
in [**Hospital3 **] Hospital ICU requiring tracheostomy in [**2-1**].  The
patient has been at Northeast [**Hospital1 **] since that discharge for
rehabilitation and ventilator managment. Over the past 2 months
the patient has been stable on tracheostomy mask during the day
and nocturnal ventilation at night secondary to OSA.  The
patient has lost 120 lbs over the past 10 mos. Over the past 2
mos, attempts were made to wean the pt from the ventilator, but
he developed respiratory distress with attempts.  The pt was
seen by ENT and found to have 90% subglottic stenosis. Of note,
pt did grow Klebsiella and Psuedomonas in his urine from
[**2109-12-7**] which was felt to be a colonizer.  Pts recent sputum
also revealed Pseudomonas and Serratia sensitive to Zosyn, but
both were also felt to be colonizers.

.
Bronchoscopy [**12-13**]: Focal subglottic stenosis secondary to
trauma
from tracheostomy tube.

.
Bronchoscopy [**12-16**]:  Severe subglottic stenosis due to
granulation
tissue, status post micro debridement, moderate - severe
malacia.

.
Bronchoscopy [**12-23**]: at mid trachea an area of thickened
mucosa. We believed that this may be thickened mucosa
secondary to a traumatic injury, secondary to tracheostomy
tube manipulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Prior to ICU transfer: The patient underwent bronchoscopy here
on [**2109-12-13**] which revealed granulation tissue from the posterior
wall above the trach tube in the proximal trachea, occluding 90%
of the lumen. The patient was noted to develop atrial
fibrillation on [**12-16**].  Repeat bronchoscopy on [**12-16**] was
performed for microdebridement of granulation tissue and and his
cuff was changed to 7mm.  Plan was for microdebridement and
trach tube change with rigid bronchoscopy on [**12-18**], however the
pt was noted to have a troponin T of 0.19 with biphasic T waves
in I/AVL and was still in afib.  He was bolused amiodarone 150
mg IV x1 on [**12-18**]. The patient was transferred to the MICU for
management of atrial fibrillation. The following is his
subsequent MICU course:
.
#Chronic Respiratory Failure/Subglottic Stenosis:   The pts
chronic repiratory failure is thought to have worsened in the
setting of subglottic stenosis, but is likely multifactorial and
related to underling OSA, obesity, and ?COPD. As per above, the
patient underwent microdebridement of his subglottic stenosis
and required repeat debridement.  He was initially maintained on
trach mask 40% during the day and pressure support [**5-31**] with 40%
FiO2.  On the 2 days prior to discharge the patient was
successfully maintained on just trach mask.  His prednisone was
discontinued as the need for this was unclear. On the day prior
to discharge, [**12-23**], the pt underwent rigid bronchoscopy again,
and his trach was changed to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 295**] #8.  The patient will be
evaluated for decannulation of the trach in 4 weeks.  His is
tolerating his PMV well at this time.
.
#Atrial Fibrillation: It is unclear if the pt has a prior h/o
PAF.  The pt has not been anticoagulated in the past.  On the
day of transfer [**12-18**] to the MICU, the patient spontaneously
cardioverted.  Currently the pt is in NSR with intermittent
atrial trigeminy.  His [**Country **] score is at least 3 (HTN, DM, CHF,
?h/o prior stroke), so pt may benefit from long term
anticoagulation. TTE showed only 1 +MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 8675**] levels were
within normal limits. The patient at this time declines
anticoaulation and understands the risks of not doing so.  His
rate is well controlled with metoprolol.
.
#Elevated Troponin: This was felt to be due to demand ischemia.
Pt had an EKG with TWI in I/AVL and interventricular delay but
no prior EKG for comparison.  Tpn T was elevated at 0.19, but
there is no prior comparison.  He has no renal insufficiency to
account for this elevation.  His CK was not elevated.  The
patient's metprolol was increased to 125 mg tid.  He was started
on lisinopril which was titrated up to 40 mg a day.  He was
maintained on ASA as well.  TTE revealed no focal wall motion
abnormalities. The patient will need an outpatient stress test.
.
#Hypertension: The patient was continued on Norvac 10 mg/d.  His
metoprolol was increased to 125 mg tid, and lisinopril and HCTZ
were added for improved BP control.  He was also continued on
his lasix 80 mg/d.
.
#Pump: Pt has evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR [**12-21**]; likely
c/w diastolic dysfunction.  TTE did not revealed systolic
dysfunction.  The patient received an extra dose of Lasix 40 mg
IV for 2 days in addition to his Lasix 80 mg po/d. CXR on [**12-23**]
did not reveal any volume overload.  The patient will remain on
lasix 80 mg /d and lisinopril.
.
#Psych: The pt was continued on Wellbutrin and Effexor
.
#DM: SSI and NPH 35/35 was continued.
.
#Diarrhea: Resolved. Pt has no elevated WBC or fever or ab pain
to indicate infectious source.  C diff negative x 1 at OSH and
again here.
.
#Access: Report was that pts midline was in place since [**10-2**].
Midline was pulled prior to discharge.
