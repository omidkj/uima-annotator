Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2122-7-26**] from her nursing
home after suffering a fall on [**2122-7-25**].  She was evaluated by
the orthopaedic and medicine services and cleared for surgery.
On [**2122-7-27**] she was taken to the operating room and underwent an
ORIF of her hip fracture.  She tolerated the procedure well, was
extubated, and transferred to the recovery room.  In the
recovery room she was tachycardic which improved with lopressor
and agitated which improved with haldol.  She was brought to the
floor from the recovery room but was noted to have increased
sedation and was brought back to the recovery room for further
monitoring.  She had increased alertness and was then
transferred to the floor.  On [**2122-7-28**] she was transfered with 1
unit of packed red blood cells due to acute blood loss anemia.
She was also seen by physical therapy to improve her strength
and mobility.  On [**2122-7-28**] a chest x-ray noted an egg shaped
mass.

On [**2122-7-29**] she was transfused with 2 units of packed red blood
cells due to acute blood loss anemia.  She was also evaluated
for dysphagia.  Unfortunately on [**2122-7-29**] she was at risk for
aspiration and did not eat.

#. Transferred to ICU s/p CODE BLUE for A-fib RVR: On [**2122-7-29**],
HR was noted to be in 200s, CODE BLUE was called. Patient was
given 2X 150mg Amiodarone and converted spontaneously to sinus
rhythm with HR in 90s. Patient was maintained in SR on amio gtt
for 12hours then switched to IV lopressor for rate control.
Anticoagulation was held because of recent surgery and anemia.
She was transfered to a general medical floor with a plan to
transition her to PO Bblockers and eventually resume
anticoagulation with the help of ortho consult.  Transferred out
of ICU and to floor and was noted to have episodes of
Tachycardia.  This initially was controlled with beta blockade
in IV, but persisted after transition to PO.

On [**2122-8-6**] she developed symptomatic palpitations and CT chest
revealed PE in segmental R posterior [**Doctor First Name **] and subsegmental in
lingula.  She was placed on heparin drip and converted to IV
metoprolol as patient had been cheeking her pills.  On [**8-7**] she
was transferred to Lovenox SQ due to access and compliance
issues.  She was also moved to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service given persistent
ectopy in face of maximum beta blockade and blood pressure
limitations.

Was again transferred to the MICU on [**8-8**] for continuing SVT.
She was loaded with dig and given IV metoprolol.  On [**8-9**] her
rates were 70s-90s and she was called out to the floor.  Prior
to transfer, changed IV metoprolol to po.  [**Name8 (MD) **] RN, she would
take crushed pills in applesauce.

elevations or changes. Did not give heparin because of recent
surgery. Started BB and gave morhpine for pain prn. Statin and
ASA.

hospitalization the patient had an ENT consult to evaluate her
hearing as well as Audiogram with recommendation for hearing aid
placement. She was fitted on [**2122-7-15**] [**Hospital **]
