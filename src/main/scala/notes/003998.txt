MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 97045**]
Reason: eval for stroke

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   83 year old woman with left sided weakness
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   eval for stroke
CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:
   None.

Provisional Findings Impression: AFSN SAT [**2153-8-4**] 12:56 PM
Somewhat limited study by motion. Acute right periventricular
subcortical
infarct is seen. Other hyperintensities on diffusion images
could be due to
shine through or subacute infarcts. Severe changes of small
vessel disease
are seen. Also noted is a 2-cm mass partially visualized on
diffusion images
within the right parotid. This can be further evaluated with CT
of the neck
or MRI of the neck as clinically appropriate.

Final Report
EXAM: MRI of the brain.

CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with left-sided weakness.

TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion
axial images
of the brain were acquired. Correlation was made with CT of
[**2153-7-24**].

FINDINGS: Diffusion images demonstrate an area of acute
subcortical
periventricular infarct in the right periventricular region
adjacent to the
posterior portion of the body of the right lateral ventricle.
Subtle
hyperintensities in the left periventricular region and right
occipital region
on diffusion images appear to be T2 shine through or could be
due to subacute
infarcts. Diffuse small vessel disease is identified in the
white matter.
Several subcortical lacunes are seen in both basal ganglia
region. Thalami
also demonstrate chronic infarcts. There is mild to moderate
brain atrophy
seen. Vascular flow voids are maintained.

IMPRESSION: Somewhat limited study by motion. Acute right
periventricular
subcortical infarct is seen. Other hyperintensities on diffusion
images could
be due to shine through or subacute infarcts. Severe changes of
small vessel
disease are seen. Also noted is a 2-cm mass partially visualized
on diffusion
images within the right parotid. This can be further evaluated
with CT of the
neck or MRI of the neck as clinically appropriate.

CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.

A stent overlies the midline in the upper abdomen, presumably an
aortic stent.
An oral-type tube is present,
