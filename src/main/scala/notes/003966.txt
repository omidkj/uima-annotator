Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Dizziness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 73 yo man with a h/o rheumatic heart disease
s/p bioprosthetic AVR, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with an EF of
20%, and s/p AICD in [**2168**] who presented to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital on
[**2169-6-12**] with dizziness.  Per the patient's daughter, the patient
was in his normal state of health until approximately one week
ago, when he began to experience periodic episodes of dizziness
associated with tachycardia, nausea, weakness, and urinary
incontinence.  The day of admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 99580**] was noted by
his daughter to be "grey" during one of these episodes, so EMS
was called and he was brought to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital for further
evaluation.
.
At [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, his AICD was interrogated and demonstrated
sustained monomorphic VT, the longest of which lasted for 19
minutes.  This rate was apparently slower than the VT detect
rate on his defibrillator, so he was not shocked.  His pacemaker
was reprogrammed to a slower rate, and he was thereafter
cardioverted once in the ED.  He was started on an amiodarone
gtt and was admitted to the CCU.
.
In the OSH CCU, he was started on Lopressor IV and was continued
on the amiodarone gtt to suppress his arrythmia.  He then became
febrile to 104.9, hypotensive to 81/35 and was found to have [**5-8**]
bottles of GPCs in chains in his blood. He was started on
CTX/Vancomycin and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.
.
On arrival to the CCU, the patient was very uncomfortable with
his foley in place, and he was occasionally speaking in Polish.
He stated that he had occasional nausea and dizziness but
otherwise had no acute complaints. Of note, he was alert and
oriented to person, place, and date but did not demonstrate
insight into his condition.
.
On review of systems, he denied any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denied recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denied exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems was notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25-30 %) with akinesis of the
basal inferior, inferolateral and lateral segments. The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with depressed free
wall contractility. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the
sinus level. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present.
No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but
cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valv
