[**2156-6-5**]: x-ray chest and pelvis:

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute traumatic injury within the chest.
2. Fractures of both superior pubic rami, and right inferior
pubic ramus.

[**2156-6-5**]:  cat scan of c-spine:

 IMPRESSION:
1. No fracture.
2. Mild retrolisthesis of C3 on C4, which is likely degenerative
in etiology.
If the patient has tenderness in this region, an MRI can be
obtained for
further evaluation.
3. Paraseptal emphysema.
4. Mild cervical spondylosis

[**2156-6-5**]: cat scan of the head:

IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Fractures involving the inner and outer table of frontal
sinus with blood in the sinus. There is adjacent bifrontal
subgaleal hematoma. No
pneumocephalus is identified.
3. Nondisplaced fractures of the right zygoma and frontal
process of the
maxillar. Minimally displaced fractures of both nasal bones.

[**2156-6-5**]:  cat scan of sinus, mandible

 IMPRESSION: Multiple facial fractures as described above
including fractures involving the frontal bone, the anterior
process of the maxilla, both nasal bones, and right zygoma.
Blood is noted within the left frontal sinus and tracking into
left ethmoid air cells. Extensive hematoma surrounding the
frontal bone and extending into the right periorbital region.

[**2156-6-5**]: cat scan of abdomen and pelvis:

IMPRESSION:
1. Extraperitoneal hematoma involving the space of Retzius with
no areas of active contrast extravasation. However,
extraperitoneal bladder injury cannot be excluded on this study
and a CT cystogram is recommended for further evaluation.
2. Multiple pelvic fractures as described including bilateral
superior and
inferior pubic rami fractures, and a right sacral fracture which
is
nondisplaced.
3. Fracture of the spinous process of L3, which appears
nondisplaced.
4. No traumatic injury seen within the chest or abdomen.

[**2156-6-5**]: retro-urogram:

 IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of leak or urethral disruption.
2. Likely type 1 (stretching) injury of the prostatic urethra.

[**2156-6-5**]: x-ray of the wrist:

 Comminuted fracture of the distal radius with intra-articular
extension.
Mildly displaced right ulnar styloid fracture.
2. Comminuted and displaced fracture of the base of the first
left
metacarpal.

[**2156-6-5**]:  x-ray of left ankle:

 IMPRESSION: No fracture or dislocation within the left knee or
ankle.

[**2156-6-5**]: x-ray of the hands:

THREE VIEWS LEFT HAND: Evaluation is somewhat limited by a cast
overlying the first digit. Again seen is a comminuted
intra-articular fracture of the first metacarpal base in
unchanged alignment. There is mild diffuse
demineralization. No additional fracture is identified.
Sclerotic foci
within the fifth middle phalanx, fourth proximal phalanx, and
fifth metacarpal head may represent bone islands.

THREE VIEWS RIGHT HAND: There is no acute fracture or
dislocation in the
hand. There is background of demineralization and mild
degenerative change at the first carpometacarpal joint. Known
distal radial and ulnar styloid
fractures are best evaluated on the same day wrist radiographs.

[**2156-6-6**]: EKG:

Sinus rhythm. Left anterior fascicular block. No previous
tracing available for comparison

[**2156-6-7**]:  chest x-ray:

New heterogeneous opacification in the right lower lung without
clear evidence of atelectasis is most likely pneumonia.
Emphysema is moderate, apical predominant. There is no pleural
effusion, pneumothorax or pulmonary edema.
Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal. Transvenous
right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads follow their
expected courses.

[**2156-6-9**]: CTA pelvis:

 IMPRESSION:
1. No new significant hematoma identified. There is less blood
in the space of Retzius but increased blood more cranially
within the posterior
retroperitoneum, felt to represent redistribution of previous
hemorrhage. The amount of hematoma about the fracture sites has
decreased from prior exam.

2. Probable punctate 3-4 mm pseudoaneurysm adjacent to the bony
fractures of the right superior ramus. Again, no significant
surrounding hematoma
identified to suggest active or recent bleeding. Equivocal
additional
punctate 1-2 mm pseudoaneurysm versus prominent vessel within
the medial
compartmental thigh musculature on the left.

3. Interval development of bilateral lower lobe, right greater
than left,
consolidation with suggestion of early cavitation on the right
highly
suggestive of an infectious pneumonia, presumably aspiration
related.

[**2156-6-10**]:  Venous duplex studies:

Bilateral assessment of both legs was ordered; however,
indication for exam gives only symptomatology on the left.
Duplex and color Doppler show no evidence of acute or chronic
DVT involving either lower extremity from the common femoral
through to the proximal tibial veins.
