Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6346**]
Chief Complaint:
Colocutaneous fistula, panniculitis, cellulitis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2128-12-26**] EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY, COLOCUTANEOUS FISTULA TAKEDOWN,
EXTENDED RIGHT COLECTOMY, LYSIS OF ADHESIONS, ILEOCOLOSTOMY,
PERCUTANEOUS GASTROSTOMY TUBE, SOFT TISSUE DEBRIDEMENT & VENTRAL
HERNIA REPAIR

[**2129-1-1**] Wound exploration, VAC removal, skin and deep
soft tissue debridement and VAC replacement

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] F with history of Afib, CAD, CHF and
colocutaneous fistula presents with cellulitis, leukocytosis and
colocutaneous fistula.  History is unclear, but pt does report
having a history of an incisional hernia in the past(possibly
from a hysterectomy) which became complicated with a
colocutaneous fistula.  It is unclear how many surgical
procedures she has undergone however she did present with an
outside hospital
operative report from [**2125-12-14**].   On [**2125-12-14**] pt underwent
resection of infected mesh and closure of colocutaneous fistula.

The mesh was resected and a 2 cm defect was found on the
anterior
abdominal wall.  The defect was closed with a 2-0 Prolene in
running fashion and 3-0 silk interrupted seromuscular closure
was
performed to re-enforce this defect.  The fascia was closed with
1 nylon interrupted sutures and the sink was left open for
packing.  At some unclear point the hernia re-occurred.  Per her
daughter the patient started leaking feculent material this
morning from her wound (similar to prior colocutaneous fistula)
and she went to [**Hospital3 **]. At [**Location (un) **] it was noted that
in
addition to this feculent material draining from her abdomen she
had cellulitis and panniculitis.  CT scan was obtained and she
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.  She denies fevers,
chills, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, constipation.


Past Medical History:
A. fib, vertigo, CAD, CHF

CVS: irreg
Pulm: no resp distress
Abd: Soft but distended.  Feculent material draining from R
mid/lower abdomen from what appears to be a necrotic (dusky)
colocutaneous fistula.  There are 3 distinct opening in the
skin.
There is surrounding erythema overlying most of her pannus
extending >30 cm in diameter across her abdomen consistent with
cellulitis.  The pannus is firm and tender.

IMAGING:
- [**12-26**] CT A/P (OSH): (wet read) large incisional hernia
w/colocutaneous fistula, small bowel is also within the hernia,
no evidence of obstruction or clear evidence of compromised
bowel (pneumatosis or wall thickening), soft tissue inflammation
surrounding consistent
with panniculitis, also a phlegmonous collection w/in ant
abdominal wall.
- [**12-26**] CXR: Heart size is enlarged. Mediastinum is unremarkable.
Bilateral small amount of pleural effusion as well as left lower
lobe atelectasis are new as compared to the prior study.
- [**12-27**] CXR: The appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette as
well as bibasal atelectasis and bilateral small pleural effusion
is unchanged. No new consolidations or pneumothorax have been
demonstrated.





Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the ACS service and taken to the operating
room on [**2128-12-26**] for exploratory laparotomy, colocutaneous fistula
takedown, extended right colectomy, lysis of adhesions,
ileocolostomy, percutaneous gastrostomy tube, soft tissue
debridement and ventral hernia repair. Postoperatively she was
taken to the ICU where she was noted to be in rapid atrial
fibrillation. She was treated with Amiodarone drip and prior to
transfer to floor she was ordered for oral amiodarone and given
IV Lopressor.

Upon transfer to floor her heart rate remained in the high
130's-140's range. She received additional IV Lopressor doses;
Digoxin was recommended by Cardiology and a loading dose was
given. Once her rate was controlled she was started on daily
Digoxin but was noted with episodes of bradycardia; her Digoxin
was changed to every other day dosing. Her Atenolol was
restarted at 12.5 mg daily.

Tube feedings via her gastrostomy tube were started early on;
Nutrition was consulted for recommendations and changes made
accordingly. She was also given an oral diet for which she is
currently tolerating.

On [**1-1**] she was taken back to the operating room for wound
exploration, VAC removal, skin and deep soft tissue debridement
and VAC replacement. There were no complications. The
antibiotics that she had been started on postoperatively
continued until [**2129-1-4**], these were administered via a PICC that
was removed prior to discharge.

She was evaluated by Physical therapy and is being recommended
for rehab after her acute hospital stay. She will be discharged
with plans for continuing VAC dressing therapy.

Discharge Instructions:
You were hospitalized with an infection along your colon which
required an operation and also repair of your ventral hernia. A
