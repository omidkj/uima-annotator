Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY
[**2128-2-3**] dx with AML after presenting to EW with vaginal
bleeding. Treated with "7&3" + Plerixafor (protocol 09-383).
Found to have a underlying MDS on post induction BM bx. MUD allo
SCT on [**2128-4-15**] (Flu/Bu/ATG)- complicated by VRE bacteremia and
anthracycline induced cardiomyopathy. She was admitted to
hospital on [**2128-7-7**] with fevers. BM bx confirmed relapsed AML.
[**2128-7-13**] - [**2128-7-17**]: Dacogen
[**2128-8-5**] - [**2128-8-9**]: Cytarabine
[**2128-9-9**] - [**2128-9-13**]: Dacogen
[**2128-9-21**] - [**2128-10-8**]: Admitted for a liver biopsy and evidence of
iron overload was found, likely secondary to transfusions in the
past. Question GVHD from recent transplant vs other toxic effect
of possible medications versus likely transfusion related
hemosiderosis which is supported by biopsy.
Liver MRI consistent with hemosiderosis and biopsy cannot rule
out GVHD due to mild bile duct dilation.
Ground glass opacities on CXR and CT and bronchial washings done
to investigate etiology. Cytology negative for malignant cells.
BAL cultures negative.
- d/c'd on posaconazole and cefpidoxime.

      STAPHYLOCOCCUS LUGDUNENSIS.    FINAL SENSITIVITIES.
         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.
      CORYNEBACTERIUM SPECIES (DIPHTHEROIDS).
         Isolated from only one set in the previous five days.
