Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer for aortic valve abscess on TTE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2125-3-16**] Redo sternotomy/Bentall procedure ( [**Street Address(2) 6158**]. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
mechanical valve/graft composite)/removal MV vegetation


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 29M with IVDU, MV and AV strep viridans
endocarditis, s/p mitral and aortic valve replacement 6/[**2124**]. He
is transferred from [**Hospital1 **] after a potential aortic valve
abscess was seen on surveillance TTE. Since having his valves
replaced, he denies further IVDA. He was hospitalized "weeks
ago" at LGH for cellulitis, and again about 4-5 weeks ago
presumably for another episode of IE. No records accompany this
patient who is admittedly unclear about the details of his
complicated course. He was feeling weak with sores on his feet
and hands which prompted this recent treatment course. He has
been at [**Hospital1 **] for 4 of a projected 6-8wk course of
ampicillin/rifampin, though we do not know the bug. Today, a TTE
showed questionable mitral regurgitation and a possible aortic
valve abscess. He denies ongoing IVDA, and feels at his
baseline.
.
He initially had strep viridans MV IE [**9-/2123**] treated with
parenteral antibiotics. He was hospitalized at [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**Date range (1) 85496**]/11 with streptococcus viridans blood stream infection
found to later be MV and AV endocarditis. While iniitally
planning for conservative management with antibiotics, he
developed complete heart block, respiratory and heart failure,
necessitating AVR/MVR with St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical valves. Completed
4 weeks of post op ceftriaxone and 2 weeks gentamycin. Felt to
be initiated by IV cocaine abuse.

Cardiac surgery was consulted for evaluation of redo
sternotomy/Bentall.

Social History:
Was living with his mother prior to hospitalization. Smoking
about 1/2PPD, no ETOH or drugs. Trying to get SSI

Family History:
Father died at age 57 of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (heavy
smoker). Mother had [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer with a colectomy, GF died of

Tee [**2125-3-16**]:PRE-BYPASS:
This study is limited due to acoustic shadowing from mechanical
valves in the aortic & mitral positions.No spontaneous echo
contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or
left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
the body of the right atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
sinuses of Valsalva are dilated. A mechanical aortic valve
prosthesis is present and not well seated. Abnormal rocking
motion is noted. A paravalvular aortic valve leak is present.
The aortic valve prosthesis appears abnormal. An aortic annular
abscess is seen. Significant aortic regurgitation is present,
but cannot be quantified.
A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present. The motion of
the mitral valve prosthetic leaflets appears normal. A small
paravalvular mitral prosthesis leak is present in what appears
to be originating behind the posterior leaflet. This is more
than the typical washing jet seen in this type of mechanical
valve. A typical washing jet is noted originating behind the
anterior leaflet. A 1.1 x 1.5cm echodensity is seen in junction
with the ventricular side of the anterior leaflet of the
mechanical mitral valve prosthesis.There is no pericardial
effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the
results in the operating room.

POSTBYPASS:
The patient is AV paced on a phenylephrine infusion.
Biventricular function is maintained. EF 55%. There is a well
seated mechanical valve in the mitral position. Peak and Mean
Gradients across the mitral prosthesis are 7mmHg & 3mmHg,
respectively with a cardiac output of 7.8L/m. There are
characteristic washing jets noted. The echodensity noted
prebypass is no longer present.There is a well seated mechanical
valve in the aortic position. The study is limited due to the
presence of acoustic shadowing from the aortic valve conduit &
mechanical valve in the mitral position. There is no AI. Peak &
mean gradients across the valve are 28 & 14mmHg,
respectively.The remaining aorta is intact.The remaining valves
are unchanged. I certify that I was present for this procedure
in compliance with HCFA regulations.
