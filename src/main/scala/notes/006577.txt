Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 25786**] is a 58 year old gentleman with asthma who was
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for difficulty breathing and cough.

1. Asthma exacerbation: The patient was tachypneic and wheezy on
presentation, and treated for status asthmaticus. The patient's
respiratory status rapidly improved with steroids and albuterol/
ipratropium nebs. The etiology of the patient's asthma
exacerbation was thought to be a viral upper respiratory tract
infection. The differential diagnosis included
community-acquired pneumonia, given patient's elevated lactate
and vague bailar opacities noted on CXR. The patient was
initally treated with ceftriaxone/ levofloxacin, which was
narrowed to just levofloxacin on admission to the intensive care
unit. The patient also initially received oseltamivir, which was
discontinued when the patient's influenza DFA returnded
negative. The patient was given his home Advair. He was also
given famotidine, which he will require only until his steroid
taper is complete. The patient will need an influenza vaccine
and asthma teaching (including peak flow meter) prior to
discharge. The patient will need to follow up in pulmonary
clinic. Blood cultures were pending at the time of transfer out
of the intensive care unit and will need to be followed. He had
completed a five day course of levaquin upon day of discharge
and will be on a prednisone steroid taper. He will need PCP and
pulmonary [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] as an outpatient.

2. Tachycardia: This was thought to be multifactorial, likely
related to infection, volume depletion, inhaled bronchodilators.
The patient was treated with IV fluids and heart rate responded
appropriately.  CT angio showed no evidence for pulmonary
embolism.

3. Elevated lactate: The patient's elevated lactate was thought
to be related to infection/volume depletion. lactate trended
down throughout hospital course.

4. Hypertension: Continued home meds.

5. Rash: On admission, the patient was noted to have a fine,
punctate, blanching, macular rash, most prominent on his
forearms and thighs. This resolved within 24 hours and was
thought to be a viral exanthem.
