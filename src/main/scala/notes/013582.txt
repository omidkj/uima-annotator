Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension:  3.7 cm  <= 4.0 cm
Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness:  0.9 cm  0.6 - 1.1 cm
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness:  1.1 cm  0.6 - 1.1 cm

Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension:  *6.4 cm  <= 5.6 cm
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  35% to 40%  >= 55%

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2177-7-26**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: RA not well visualized.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV
cavity. Mild-moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.

AORTIC VALVE: Aortic valve not well seen. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Left pleural effusion.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the
basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35-40 %). The
aortic valve is not well seen. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-7-26**],
the left ventricular cavity size is smaller and a large left
pleural effusion is now present. The other findings are similar.




Brief Hospital Course:
Upon admission, an CXR was taken of Mr. [**Known lastname **] chest,
revealing a large left pleural effusion.  A chest tube was
placed, which drained 2.5 liters of serosanguinous fluid.  He
was placed on IV lasix. Vancomycin was started for sternal
erythema. Left EVH site was found to be open with purulent
drainage.  This was cultured.  Abx therapy was broadened to
include cipro and flagyl.  His vein harvest site improved
greatly. Pt. has remained stable and is ready for discharge
home.  He should follow-up in the wound clinic in 1 week.
