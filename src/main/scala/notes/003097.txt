[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
46 year old woman s/p emergency cabg x3 with IABP
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please eval lungs, patient s/p emergent CABG POD 1, previously
manifested ARDS pulmonary picture high PIPs and plateau pressure
with PaO2/FiO2<200
AP CHEST COMPARED TO [**12-18**]:

Severe pulmonary edema has changed in distribution but not in
severity. Right lung is now more consolidated than the left.
This raises the possibility of pulmonary hemorrhage or
pneumonia, but could be explained entirely by shift in edema.
Heart is normal size and mediastinal vasculature is not
particularly engorged. Tip of the intra-aortic balloon pump is
approximately a centimeter below the level of the left main
bronchus, approximately 6 cm from the apex of the aortic knob.

Small left pleural effusion is stable. No right pleural effusion
is demonstrated and there is no pneumothorax.

Tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter projects over the right pulmonary
artery, ET tube is in standard placement, midline and right
pleural drains are in place. Nasogastric tube passes to the
distal stomach. Mediastinum midline.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted and evaluated by cardiology and had CP
with hypotension during the night of admission.  She underwent
emergency cardiac catheterization which revealed: 90%LMCA
stenosis, diffusely diseased tight ostial LAD 60% lesion, 80%
ostial, diffusely diseased, 80% diseased RCA, elevated filling
pressures and 20%EF. An IAPB was placed and she went for
emergency CABGx3(SVG->LAD, Diag, OM)on [**2129-12-18**].
She was transferred to the CSRU on Levophed, Milrinone, Epi,
Vasopressin, Insulin, and Propofol.  She had persistent
hypotension and the propofol was d/c'd and she was placed on
Cisatricurium, Fentanyl, and Midaz.  She desaturated and
required bronchoscopy and had copius mucous plugging.  She
improved following this, but had persistent tachycardia in the
130-150 range and had a good cardiac output and urine output
throughout.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 40858**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] was consulted and she was
transferred for the possibility of a Heartmate insertion.
