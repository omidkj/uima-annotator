Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Valsartan / Tikosyn

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
increased shortness of breath leading to an elective right and
left heart catheterization with aortic valvuloplasty and
echocardiogram during procedure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Aortic balloon valvuloplasty


History of Present Illness:
76F with severe aortic stenosis, biventricular heart failure,
atrial fibrillation on warfarin and s/p dual-chamber pacemaker,
and dilated cardiomyapathy who presents to the CCU after having
a right and left heart catheterizaton with aortic valvuloplasty
in the setting in increased SOB. The patient is s/p aortic
valvuloplasty in [**2117**] after she was not felt to be a candidate
for cardiac surgery. She also has dilated cardiomyopathy with an
EF of 20%. She is s/p biventricular ICD placement in [**2117**] with
recent generator change performed [**2121-7-8**]. She has been
experiencing increased shortness of breath with minimal exertion
and recently underwent right and left heart catheterization by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**2121-7-9**] which demonstrated low gradient/low flow
aortic stenosis, severe pulmonary hypertension with an elevated
PCWP(=36 mmHg), and acute on chronic systolic and diastolic
heart failure. Patient is on warfarin which was stopped [**2121-8-23**]
per Dr.[**Name (NI) 32659**] instructions. Patient is now referred for right
and left heart catheterization with aortic valvuloplasty and
echocardiogram during the procedure.
.
The patient does not have any chest pain or PND. She has 2
pillow orthopnea. Occassional lower extremity edema. No
dizziness. She walks at home with a cane, but her ambulation is
limited, more by pain in her leg than by dyspnea. She had a
mechanical fall in [**2120-9-21**] leading to ORIF for a right
supracondylar femur fracture. She does feel fatigued and SOB
with minimal activity, such as dressing herself. Her boyfriend
[**Name (NI) 12239**] is also her caretaker and ensures that she takes all her
medications every day. She has had no falls in [**2120**], but the
year prior she had the mechanical fall leading to the femur
fracture, as well as 4 episodes of syncope/LOC attributed to
Tikosyn, which has since been stopped.
.
Prior Diagnostics:
[**2121-7-9**]: Cardiac Cath
-Low gradient (31), low flow aortic stenosis (valve area 0.52)
-Insignificant coronary artery disease (30% stenosis in mid LAD
second diagonal branch, and RCA proximal)
-Severe pulmonary hypertension with an elevated PCWP(=36 mmHg),
RA pressure of 17, PA 73/28 (45)
-Acute on chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure
.
[**2121-7-10**] Echo: left ventricular EF 20% (severe global systolic
dysfunction), left atrium moderately dilated, left ventricle
moderately dilated, right ventricle size normal with NML free
wall motion, critical aortical valve area (<0.8), mild (1+)
aortic regurg, moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurg, 2+
tricuspid regerg, moderate pulm systolic HTN
.
[**5-/2121**]: PASP 43mmHg. Mean gradient 33mmHg.
.
In the cath lab, initial vitals were 70, 93/49, 23, 98% (on RA).
Though the patient has an ICD, a temporary pacing wire was
inserted via catheter in order to rapidly pace her heart in
order to empty out the left ventricle prior to valvuloplasty.
However, the rapid pacing caused the patient to go into V tach.
Chest compressions were started (for 20 sec), and she was
shocked, which resolved the arrythmia. She was briefly on Neo
and dopamine during the procedure, but these were taken off soon
after the catheterization with SBPs in the 110s and MAPs in the
60s. Valvuloplasty was performed with 3-4 inflations of a 23mm
balloon. The gradient was decreased from 38 to 28, and the valve
area was increased from 0.38cm2 to 0.56cm2. PCWP was measured to
be 26. The sheaths were removed.
.
Vitals on transfer to the CCU were 70, 114/49, 20, and 99% (on
2L by NC?).
.
On arrival to the floor, patient was feeling well and denied
chest pain or SOB. She had mild pain at her ICD and mild pain
att the femoral catheter site.

ECHO [**2121-8-28**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF = 25 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall
function. Significant aortic stenosis is present (not
quantified). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae. Mild to moderate ([**12-23**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2121-7-10**], the transaortic valvular pressure gradients are
similar, but the left ventricular stroke volume is higher.
Therefore, the aortic valve orifice area is increased, although
it could not be calculated with vertainty due to technical
factors. The mitral regurgitation appears significantly reduced,
although the aortic regurgitation is increased.
