Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Right lung atelectasis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Rigid bronchoscopy with attempted debulking procedure [**7-31**]

History of Present Illness:
48 yo woman who was intially diagnosed with stage IIIb SCC of
the lung invlolving th carina in [**2177-9-2**]. She was treated
with XRT cisplatin/etoposide and later presented with central
airway obstruction and was referred here where she had a
placement and removal of a silicone Y-stent, placement of 2
Ultraflex metal stents (one in distal trachea, one in R main
stem bronchus), and argon plasma coagulation of tumor.  She was
subsequently lost to follow up.
.
Since then she was reasonably well until [**2178-4-2**], when she
had persistent dyspnea and prioductive cough. She was been
treated with avelox for suspected PNA 4-5 times since [**Month (only) 547**].
About two weeks ago, she presented with progressive dyspnea and
could barely ambulate across the room. PET CT on [**2178-7-9**] showed R
lung collapse, intense uptake at distal trachea and proximal R
mainstem bronchus. Bronchoscopy on [**2178-7-22**] revealed complete
malignant right sided airway obstruction with growth of the
tumor through the mesh of the stent. Biopsy was positive for
SCC. She signed out AMA, but then re presented with progressive
dyspnea on [**7-27**]. A plan for brachytherapy was considered, but
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] to relieve airway obstruction
and for further therapy. On transfer, she was on a medical floor
with no respiratory distress or stridor on 1L NC.
.
She was taken to the OR by IP to evaluate stents and for
possible new stent placment.  She was found have complete
obstruction of the right main bronchus and partial obstruction
of the left main bronchus with purulent secretions throughout.
The right mid and lower lobes were localized and were open,
right upper lobe is completely gone.  Patient was found to be
hypoxic after the procedure, intubated, and required 2L of LR
and then neosynephrine.  She remained largely dependent on
pressors at the time of transfer.  Her vent settings were
downtitrated to PEEP 5 and FiO2 of 50%, satting 97%.


Past Medical History:
Stage IIIB NSCLC diagnosed by transbronchial biopsy in [**8-10**].
Currently on chemo/rads.
Post-obstructive pna of the right lung.  Treated with cefuroxime
and fluconazole.
Emphysema
Hypertension
Anxiety and panic attacks
TAH w/ tubal ligation


Social History:
Smoking 30 year pack history, recently quit smoking.
ETOH: recently quit, but hx of 3 drinks/day.
denies illicit drug use.
Used to work as a housekeeper at Courtland Manor.
Divorced and lives alone, but has three children.

Brief Hospital Course:
48 yo F with recently diagnosed lung SCC involving the carina,
s/p Y stent in [**8-10**], XRT and chemo, recently re-presetned with
dyspnea found to have total R lung collaps, and complete
malignant obstruction of R main stem, s/p IP intervention,
admitted for hypoxemia and hypotension.
.
She was initially hypotensive and hypoxic immidiately after IP
procedure.  She required transient pressor support and was on
the ventilator for approximately 36 hours.  It was noted that
she had a pericardial effusion on the CT scan, which cardiology
came to evaluate with echo and determined that there were no
signs of tamponade.  She was started on antibiotics (Vanco/[**Last Name (un) **])
empirically for transient bacteremia ([**2-3**] to IP procedure) and
possible post-obstructive pneumonia.
.
Second day, she improved and was able to come off the vent.  She
had a repeat imaging that showed mildly improved ventilation of
the right lung (though still largely collapsed [**2-3**] to tumor).
There were appreciable pus and partial blockage of the left main
bronchus from the tumor.  Goals of care was discussed with the
patient and she refused any more IP interventions. She was
discharged in stable condition.
