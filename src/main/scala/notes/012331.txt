Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

central venous line catheter

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 74 yo female with hx of DMII who was recently
admitted from [**Date range (1) 99426**] for fevers thought to be secondary
to cellulitis and shoulder pain found to have rotator cuff tear.
 She was discharged to a NH. She was recently admitted to [**Last Name (un) 1724**]
from [**Date range (3) 99427**] secondary to swelling of her left arm and
US was negative for a DVT and was started emperically on
antibiotics for a cellulitis without improvement.  On [**6-11**] she
was again sent to an OSH ED and diagnosed with a UTI and was
continued on levofloxacin. She was at that time also found to
have a new left shoulder dislocation which they were unable to
reduce and she had no recent history of trauma. Pt family
requested she be evaluated at the [**Hospital1 18**] and so she was
transfered.
.
In ED, she was found to have a UTI and PNA. Given 3g Unasyn and
tylenol for a fever. Ortho consulted for left shoulder
dislocation and recommended CT left shoulder and plan for closed
reduction tomorrow AM.
.
History obtained by admitting team included that she has had
left shoulder pain for 10 days and has not been eating well for
3-4 days because of the pain. No dysuria and no abdominal pain.
No nausea/vomiting. No chest pain or shortness of breath. No
coughing.
.
Upon arrival to floor blood pressure was 88/doppler, HR 100.
She was given 250cc bolus and repeat BP 75/doppler.  Then given
1 liter bolus with improvement in SBP to 100.  Also had diarrhea
on floor after kaexylate.
.
Further history could not be obtained.  Patient states that she
was in pain all over, worse in left hand.  Otherwise, reported
breathing was normal. Patient tearful, asking to be released.

CXR: Left lower lung opacity, possibly representing atelectasis
versus pneumonia.
.
EKG: sinus tachycardia @ 105, nl axis, nl intervals, no ST-T
wave changes, no peaked T waves
.
Shoulder/Wrist/Elbow Xrays: positive for left shoulder
dislocation
.
RUQ US: Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
.
Echo: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity
size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal in those walls which were visualized.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
.
Shoulder MRI: Anterior dislocation of the shoulder. Markedly
atrophic musculature about the shoulder, as described, as well
as nonspecific edema in the subcutaneous tissues. Does this
patient have any history of an underlying disorder such as
muscular dystrophy? No definite rotator cuff tear identified,
though this evaluation is limited as described above.
Probable tear of the long head of the biceps tendon at the level
of the
humeral head. [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name 3450**] and reverse [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name 3450**] deformities
.
Chest CTA: Large left subpectoral hematoma. Redemonstration of
anterior left shoulder dislocation. Moderate bilateral pleural
effusions and bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient's ICU course is briefly summarized by problems
below.  Ultimately the patient was made DNR/DNI and expired on
[**6-25**] from profound respiratory acidosis in setting of altered
mental status.  Her pain was difficult to control without
causing respiratory depression.  Family felt adament about pain
control but declined re-intubation knowing that she would likely
succomb to respiratory failure.
.
1. Hypotension: The patient was admitted from the OR with low
blood pressures, and was initially treated with neo which was
transitioned to levophed. His pressures improved with saline
boluses and pressors were quickly titrated off. This was
considered likely related to septic shock secondary to pneumonia
and UTI as well as hypovolemia given dramatic improvement with
saline. She was treated broadly for infection with Vanco and
Zosyn. She remained hemodynamically stable throughout the
remainder of her hospitalization and eventually required
antihypertensives for high blood pressures.
.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient was intubated in the OR for
closed reduction of left shoulder dislocation, but remained
intubated in the setting of hypotension and pressor
requirements. She remained intubated for a imaging exams and
possible return to the OR. When it was decided that the patient
would not be taken urgently to the OR, she was weaned and
extubated on [**2164-6-19**]. She was treated for a left lower lobe
pneumonia with Vancomycin and Zosyn. Her sputum culture grew
MRSA and acinetobacter.  Her respiratory status was later
complicated by development of respiratory acidosis in the
setting of lethargy [**3-15**] pain control.  Multiple attempts were
made to control pain without causing sedation unsuccessfully.
Anesthesia/Pain was consulted for assistance but the patient
continued to be lethargic with pain control and in significant
pain without.  After family meeting, the focus of care was
shifted to a priority for comfort, and the patient was made
DNR/DNI knowing that she would likely pass from respiratory
faliure.
.
3. Pain/Left anterior shoulder dislocation: The patient was
admitted with a left shoulder dislocation without a clear
inciting event. She was neurovascularly intact. Orthopedics saw
the patient and took her for a closed reduction on [**2164-6-13**].
Unfortunately, the procedure was unsuccesful. An MRI showed
continued dislocation with atrophy of the surrounding
musculature. Orthopedics did not think that there was an urgent
need to bring the patient to the OR for an open reduction,
especially in the setting of multiple infections and overall
poor medical status. They manipulated her arm and felt that her
pain was not related to the shoulder dislocation. Afterwards, a
hematoma under the left pectoralis, which was thought to be
related to the manipulation.
.
4. UTI: The patient was admitted with fevers and hypotension and
found to have a positive UA and urine culture which grew E.
coli, which was resistent to fluoroquinolones. She was treated
with Vancomycin and Zosyn.
.
3. PNA: The patient was noted to have a left lower lobe
infiltrate on CXR. Sputum culture grew MRSA and acinetobacter
and she was treated with a 10-day course of Zosyn and
Vancomycin.
.
4. ARF: The patient was admitted with a creatinine of 1.8. FENa
was less than 1%. Her creatinine improved with fluids to 1.2.
.
5. Epistaxis: An NG was attempted but resulted in epistaxis,
likely anterior. ENT saw the patient and packed the nare with
good hemostasis. Her HIT was negative and she had no evidence of
DIC/TTP.
.
6 Psoriasis: The patient has a history of severe psorias
