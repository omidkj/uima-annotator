Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 25936**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotnsion and altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2142-11-20**] - Right internal jugular central line placement
[**2142-11-20**] - Started on vasopressors

History of Present Illness:
84F h/o dilated cardiomyopathy (non-ischemic, last echo in [**2138**]
with ef of 15%, mild MR, diffused hypokinesis), Afib on
coumadin, history of PE, who was transferred from [**Hospital1 392**] with
hypotension, altered mental status, lethargy, confusion,
otherwise without chest pain and with some mild shortness of
breath.  She was having several days of AMS and lethargy,
brought to [**Hospital3 **].  CXR and Echo noted to have dilated
cardiomyopathy.  Her BP was reportedly 50/30 in [**Hospital1 392**], repeat
was 90/70s, got 1L of fluid.  She got a central line placed and
started on dobutamine prior to transfer.  Unclear of how she got
to [**Hospital1 **] initially, she is not sure how she got to the hospital
or why she is here.

Of note, she has extensive atrius records.  Per records,
baseline BP was noted to be in 90's/60's mmHg as an outpatient.
Of note, she was recently started on levothyroxin on [**10-29**] for
TSH of 17, also reportedly was having continous congnitive
decline for the past year.  It was notable that she gained
approximately 30 lbs from [**Month (only) 216**] to [**Month (only) **] (140-170).  Brother
has been frustrated with patient as she has not been amenable to
changes in home, such as moving to downstairs bedroom and bath.
He has taken over her medications.  She had a recent INR of 8.3,
pt was taking her pills incorrectly.  Most recent BP in office
was noted to be in 70's sbp, decreased Avapro from 300 to 75.
She was noted to have hypothyroidism with TSH of 17, told to
start levoxyl 75 and titrate.  UA was positive but she denied
sxs, she was given a short course of cipro for this.

Per report by her brother, he believe that she has been gaining
fluid in her body.  She has a poor diet (chips/hotdogs), her
brother's wife make the food for her for the past few weeks.
Her brother manage her medication at home.  He reports that she
called him earlier in the day and wanted to go to the hospital.
Feels that her mental status is poor.  Sunday night she fell but
was trying to use the tv remote as a phone.

In ED, inital vitals were 98.3, 84, 93/74, 18 98% on 2L NC.
Exam was notable for A&Ox1-2, warm extremities, b/l at bases,
swelling of b/l LE 1+ with chronic skin changes.  Labs were
notable for wbc of 2.6, hgb of 10.5, plt of 106, proBNP: [**Numeric Identifier 92148**],
INR: 4.1, creatinine of 2.0, sodium of 146, pH 7.32 pCO2 66 pO2
107 HCO3 36, lactate of 0.7, and trop of 0.01, TSH pending (11
at [**Hospital1 **], 17 at atrius on [**10-29**]).  UA and blood cultures were
sent. EKG was showing afib, lbbb old. She underwent a bedside
echo at ED showed poor squeeze, CXR was notable for LLL
consolidation and cardiomegaly and CT head was negative for
intracranial lesions.  She was seen by cardiology.  She was
given dobutamine, levophed, zosyn, and vanc.  She was admitted
to CCU for cardiogenic/septic shock.  Vitals prior to transfer
96 rectal 76, 106/65, 20, 100 2L NC. Lines: pta right
femoral/left 20g, no IVF. Drips: vanc/zosyn/levophed/dobutamine.


On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Imaging:
-TTE ([**2142-11-20**]) - The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium
is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is severely dilated with severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15%). No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened with moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are moderately
thickened with moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is a large pericardial effusion which appears loculated in the
area of the right ventricular free wall. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Severely dilated left ventricle with severe global
hypokinesis. Moderately dilated right ventricle with moderate
free wall hypokinesis. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate
to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension. Large loculated pericardial effusion.

-CXR ([**2142-11-20**]) - 1. Left base consolidation, likely
representing pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
There are small bilateral pleural effusions. Recommend dedicated
upright view when clinically able to document resolution. The
differential diagnosis includes an obstructive mass, or large
pulmonary embolus.
2. Mild cardiac decompensation.

-CXR ([**2142-11-20**]) - Previous pulmonary vascular congestion has
decreased. Small right and small-to-moderate left pleural
effusion persist and partially obscure what could be areas of
consolidation in both lower lungs. Cardiac silhouette is
moderately enlarged. Fullness in the mediastinum in the region
of the pulmonary outflow tract raises the possibility of
pulmonary hypertension. In addition to a possibility of
pneumonia in both lower lobes, particularl
