CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left-sided weakness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old
right-handed male with a history of hypertension, abdominal
aortic aneurysm of 3 cm to 4 cm, and polio in the past who
was admitted on [**3-16**] after three hours of left-sided
weakness.

He says he was in his usual state of health when he went to
bed the night before.  At 6:15 in the morning, he was also in
his usual state of health.  He was working on his computer
shortly after getting up when he fell out of his chair.  At
that time, he had no other complaints.

He was initially taken to [**Hospital6 2561**] where he had
a head computed tomography and a magnetic resonance imaging.
The head computed tomography showed a dense hyperintensity in
the right carotid as well as some areas of effacement in the
right middle cerebral artery territory.  The magnetic
resonance imaging showed no flow in the right coronary
artery.

He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] approximately three to four hours after the onset of
symptoms.  He was past the window for intravenous t-PA;
however, he was taken to the angio suite where he received
intraarterial t-PA.  Because the right carotid was completely
occluded, the cerebral circulation was assessed via the left
internal carotid artery and intraarterial t-PA was given.
Initially, the right M1 and A1 segments were both occluded as
well as the internal carotid on the right side.  However,
after t-PA his symptoms significantly improved, and he was
discharged to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.

When he initially presented, the patient had significant
anosognosia for his left-sided weakness.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  History of polio 40 years ago.
3.  History of abdominal aortic aneurysm of 3 cm to 4 cm.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Medications at home included
hydrochlorothiazide and Valsartan.

ALLERGIES:  He has a questionable allergy to PENICILLIN in
the past; although, at this time he reports no known drug
allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has a 50-pack-year history of tobacco.
He no longer smokes.  He has occasional alcohol use.  He
lives with his wife.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history was noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed the patient was afebrile, blood
pressure ranged from the 120s to 170s/50s to 70, and heart
rate was 80 to 110.  The patient was intubated and
ventilated.  Generally, he was intubated with left
hemiplegia.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.  Mucous membranes were
moist.  Neck examination revealed he had no carotid bruits.
Pulmonary examination revealed lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  The abdomen was benign.  Extremity examination
revealed he had no edema.  Distal pulses were 4+, and no
rashes.  Mental status examination at the time of his initial
examination after intraarterial t-PA, he was somnolent and
intubated.  He was following one step commands.  He
inconsistently recognized his left hand as his own and would
move his left leg to command.  Cranial nerve examination
revealed the eyes were somewhat deviated to the right, but he
was able to track passed midline.  Pupils were small, equal,
round, and minimally reactive to light.  No relative afferent
pupillary defect.  He blinked to visual stimuli from both
eyes.  Extraocular movements as above.  Corneas revealed
reflexes were symmetric.  He had a left facial droop.  He had
an intact gag and was intubated.  Motor examination revealed
normal bulk.  Left arm was flaccid except for a small amount
of finger flexion on command and extensor movements to pain.
He had decreased tone as well in the left leg and proximal
right arm.  Sensory examination revealed he had extensor
movement to pain in the left arm, and the leg withdrew.
Reflexes were decreased on the left with a strong extensor
plantar response on the left.  Reflexes on the right were
somewhat preserved except absent at the triceps, and he had
an equivocal plantar response on the right.  Coordination and
gait were not assessed at that time.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
admission revealed his white blood cell count was 14.5,
hematocrit was 38.6, and platelets were 320.  Chemistry-7
revealed sodium was 135, potassium was 4.5, chloride was 24,
and creatinine was 1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 71-year-old male with a
history of hypertension and tobacco use who presented with a
complete right coronary artery occlusion that was initially
occluded in the right A1 and M1 divisions as well.  He
received intraarterial t-PA approximately five hours after
the onset of symptoms with improved flow in his intracerebral
circulation.

He was sent to the Intensive Care Unit intubated.  He was
gradually extubated, and his mental status gradually
improved.  His left-sided weakness also significantly
improved throughout his hospital course.  His Intensive Care
Unit course was also complicated by a urinary tract
infection.  He was started on Levaquin.  He also had a labile
blood pressure initially.  He was alternately on Nipride and
Neo-Synephrine drips to maintain his blood pressure in an
appropriate range.  He had a slightly decreased hematocrit.
However, he had a pelvic computed tomography which showed no
evidence of hematoma, and his hematocrit stabilized without
any need for a transfusion.

He was transferred to the floor on [**2136-3-20**].  At that
time, he was able to move his left distal hand and leg with
full strength.  He continued to have [**2-15**] left iliopsoas
strength and [**3-17**] left hamstring strength.  He also had [**3-17**]
left deltoid and left triceps strength.  Some of his weakness
he said was due to his old polio residual weakness.  Of note,
his left facial droop remained unchanged.

Initially, after extubation, the patient denied that he had
any problems with his left side.  He denied that he had
suffered a stroke; however, as time progressed his
anosognosia improved significantly, and he was able to say
that he has been told that he had a stroke and recognized
that his left side may have been a little weaker and that his
left face did not look normal.

On the floor, he continued to be stable; however, he
continued to have some difficulty swallowing thin liquids.
He had a bedside swallow evaluation which showed some
evidence of aspiration with thin liquids.  He was to have a
video swallow today, prior to discharge, and his swallowing
issues will be further addressed prior to discharge.

He was placed on heparin initially throughout the majority of
his hospital course and was started on Coumadin on the
evening of [**3-20**].  Physical Therapy and Occupational
Therapy assessed him and felt that he would benefit from
rehabilitation.  Otherwise, his blood pressure stabilized,
and he was weaned off his hydralazine and remained stable on
his Diovan and hydrochlorothiazide at his outpatient doses
with his blood pressure ranging from 126 to 142/60 to 70.
