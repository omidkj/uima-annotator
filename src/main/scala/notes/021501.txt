[**Date Range **] [**11-11**]: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The right atrial pressure
is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity
size are normal. There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and
infero-lateral akinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.  LVEF 45%

Brief Hospital Course:
# Coronary artery disease: Patient is status post an
inferoposterior STEMI. He received 1/2 dose tenecteplase prior
to being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Upon arrival, patient had two
bare metal stents placed to proximal RCA. Initially was on
Aggrastat, heparin. Pt had transvenous pacer placed for total
heart block peri-MI at outside hospital. After admission,
patient was doing well and without evidence of arrhythmia for
the duration of his hospitalization.  His CK peaked at 1270,
Troponin at 4.11. He was started on ASA, Plavix, Atorvastatin
80mg. Additionally, he was started on Metoprolol 50mg TID, and
Norvasc 5mg daily for uncontrolled hypertension. He will be
discharged on equivalent medications in addition to his home
dose of HCTZ.
.
# Pump: EF 45% on [**Hospital1 **].  Likely secondary to stunned myocardium.
Initially hypotensive on admission requiring dopamine drip. This
quickly resolved and patient required anti-hypertensives to
lower his blood pressure as above. He will be sent home on a new
anti-hypertensive regimen including Metoprolol, Norvasc,
Losartan and HCTZ.
.
# Rhythm: Patient had VT arrest as well as complete heart block
prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].  Also noted to have Mobitz type I. A
temporary transvenous pacer was placed prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 **]
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 75601**], and was subsequently discontinued as he
showed no further signs of heart block.  Initially was in atrial
fibrillation at admission, though spontaneously converted to
sinus rhythm. No prior history of afib. These were likely
secondary to reperfusion dysrhythmias in the setting of his
inferoposterior MI.
.
# Anemia/GI bleed: Hct initially 38 at OSH, was falling on
admission with episode of coffee ground emesis while still
intubated. Patient received a total of 3 units of pRBCs during
admission to keep his Hct over 30 in the setting of
ischemia/peri-MI.  GI was consulted, however, patient's
hematocrit stabilized and he did not have any further epi
