[**2194-9-15**] CT ABD/PELVIS w/o CONTRAST
1. Bibasilar ground-glass opacification may represent basilar
atelectasis;
however, infectious process or aspiration cannot be completely
excluded and should be considered in the correct clinical
setting.
2. Gallbladder wall is calcified placing the patient at risk for
gallbladder cancer. Thickening along the medial wall of the
gallbladder is unchanged from prior.
3. Dilated common bile duct. Hyperdense 6-mm foci in the distal
common bile duct raise concern for choledocholithiasis or soft
tissue. Recommend an ERCP/MRCP for further evaluation.
5. New hypodensities in the left lobe of the liver concerning
for
abscess/infection or metastases. These can be further evaluated
on ultrasound or MRCP.
6. Moderate perinephric stranding is slightly worse compared to
[**2194-2-27**] and is more prominent on the left versus the
right, non-specific, but could relate to acute renal failure.
Consider also correlation with
urinalysis.
7. Again noted is pre-sacral fluid collection containing air
which is slightly increased compared to [**2194-2-27**] and
shows increased air within the collection. A second walled-off
air collection noted adjacent to the larger pre-sacral fluid
collection is new since [**2194-2-27**].
8. Small bowel appears mildly dilated with no definite
transition point
identified. Findings may be due to ileus, although an early
small-bowel obstruction cannot be entirely excluded.
9. Mild perihepatic fluid and mild mesenteric stranding.

[**2194-9-16**] ERCP:
Obstruction in the lower third of the biliary tree either from
stone or a stricture. A stent was placed. Pus was noted from the
biliary tree.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum.
RECOMMENDATION: ERCP in 4 weeks to remove stent and obtain a
full cholangiogram.

[**2194-9-19**] RUQ ULTRASOUND: repeat ordered to assess interval change
in size of multiple liver abscesses
1. Two larger intrahepatic collections in the left lateral liver
are similar to that seen on [**2194-9-16**], with deeper segment III
lesion having more liquified appearance and more superficial
segment II lesion having more semi-solid appearance, each also
with associated few small satellite lesions. No definite new
lesion seen.
2. Small perihepatic ascites is increased compared to [**2194-9-15**].
3. Gallbladder is again noted to be rim calcified and containing
sludge.

[**2194-9-25**] CT Head: 1. Study is limited due to motion artifact,
particularly in the infratentorial region. However, no
intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect is seen in the
supratentorial region. Further followup with MR, if not
contraindicated, is recommended.
2. New, moderate sized lytic lesion in the left frontal bone
with some soft tissue component, most likely representing
metastatic lesion given the history, with le
