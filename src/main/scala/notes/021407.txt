Pertinent Results:
C-spine CT ([**2155-10-15**]):
No fracture or subluxation. Within the upper cervical vertebral

levels (C2-C4), there is no apparent indentation on the contour
of the thecal sac; however, there is very limited evaluation
below that level. There is mild spinal canal stenosis at those
levels.
.
T-spine CT ([**2155-10-15**]):
Interval marked progression of compression fracture deformity
involving the T4/5 vertebral bodies, with interval increase in
marked focal kyphotic angulation, retropulsion of osseous
fragments, and marked narrowing of the spinal canal at that
level. Postsurgical changes from prior laminectomy are also
again seen in this area. These findings are concerning for
interval cord compression, especially in the setting of
patient's new symptomatology.
.
L-spine CT ([**2155-10-15**]):
No new fracture or subluxation is identified. Degenerative
changes and compression deformities involving L1-L2 are similar
in comparison to the prior MRI exam of [**2155-9-17**].
.
CT angio chest ([**2155-10-16**]):
No pulmonary embolism. Progression of thoracic vertebral
compression fractures with retropulsion of fragments concerning
for cord compression. Bibasilar consolidations, left greater
than right, raise the question of aspiration.

Brief Hospital Course:
In the ED, the patient was evaluated by neurosurgery for new
cord compression.  A CT scan of the spine was performed (since
he has been historically unable to tolerate an MRI without
sedation and intubation) which showed worsening of his T4/T5
compression fracture, expulsion of bony fragments into the
spinal canal, and new compression of the cord at this level.
Per the neurosurgery consult, the patient was not a surgical
candidate since he already had baseline bowel/bladder
incontinence and left leg weakness from his prior cord
compression, and surgery would be very unlikely to improve this
baseline.

Upon arrival to the floor, there was concern that he had
worsened hypoxia, and a CT angiogram was performed which showed
no PE; it did however show bibasilar opacities consistent with
aspiration (though he has never been febrile).  He remained on
2L nasal cannula which is his baseline.

For his cord compression, his oncologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1557**] was
called who recommended starting dexamethasone 40mg PO daily.
Radiation oncology began an 8-dose treatment cycle of XRT to his
thoracic spine on [**2155-10-16**].  He was transferred to the oncologic
medicine service for the remainder of his admission.  His
dexamethasone was tapered first to 16mg  for the remainder of
his XRT treatments then to 8mg afterwards with plans to taper
upon follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**].

A pain consult was obtained to assist with his chronic pain
control and they recommended starting a Dilaudid PCA on top of
his chronic pain medications.  Although initially obtaining good
control of his pain, he became increasingly oversedated and had
an episode of decreased respiratory rate and obtundation which
required transfer to ICU for 2d, dsepite discontinuation of PCA.
 He did well in ICU and was transferred back to the oncologic
service with decreased methadone (30 tid)dosing and PRN
dilaudid, on which he has been stable.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] has an underlying anxiety disorder which prevented
him from placing TLSO brace at times as well as increased his
level of pain.  We started him on venlafaxine and dc'd his
citalopram with hopes of addressing his baseline anxiety and he
will be discharged with dose of 75mg with plans to increase to
150mg 2d after his discharge

A wound care consult was obtained for his prior neurosurgical
wound and his decubitus ulcers.  They recommended wet-to-dry
dressing to his surgical wound and local wound care with
micoazole for his pressure ulcers.

A neurology consult was obtained to evaluate if his aspiration
could be due to his cord compression causing diaphragmatic
hemiparesis or some other neurolgic defect.
