Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Peri-orbital pain and swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Incision and drainage of left nasal bridge mass
.
Biopsy of left nasal bridge mass


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]yo M with h/o CAD, CHF, presenting from [**Hospital3 10310**]
hospital with possible periorbital cellulitis with question of
intracranial spread.
.
Mr. [**Known lastname 11286**] first presented to OSH with L nasal and
periorbital swelling over the 2-3 days prior to admission. His
son also notes that he has had some confusion over the last
week, which is atypical. He denies any recent trauma, denies
F/C/NS, headaches, dizziness, CP or SOB. His son does note
decreased appetite over the last few months, with 20lb weight
loss, and has started Ensure supplements. A CT was done, which
demonstrated a 2cm x 1.5cm mass or area of infection. Concerning
was the radiologist's read of air in the orbit, cavernous sinus,
and L jugular. AP CXR done, which was reportedly unremarkable.
He was also noted to be in AF (unclear chronicity - pt and son
unaware of AF diagnosis). He was started on meropenem, and
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for neurosurgical evaluation.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were T: 97.4F, BP: 116/79, HR: 122,
RR: 25, SaO2: 98% RA. On exam he was noted to have erythema and
nasal swelling and fluctuance along the L nasal bridge. He was
given a dose of vancomycin, and, on the recommendation of
neurosurgery, sent for a repeat head CTA. The CT demonstrated a
peripherally enhancing 2.1cm x 1.4cm soft tissue mass, which
could be neoplastic, infectious, or both. There were clear
paranasal sinuses, no erosion of the nasal bone, and no evidence
of intracranial involvement. Also seen were small air bubbles of
unclear etiology, in the right orbit, bilateral IJs, adjacent to
the R IJ at level of clavicle, R cavernous sinus, and in
subcutaneous tissues posterior to the left orbital well. While
in the ED, he was also noted to be in AF with RVR to 140s,
remained hemodynamically stable, and received diltiazem 15mg IV,
which lowered HR to 90s.
.
After reaching the floor, NF resident attempted needle
aspiration - obtained tiny amount thick, purulent fluid in
needle, but insufficient to send to lab.  Plastics was
consulted, I and D was performed and [**3-18**] swab from the wound
grew coag negative staph.  Dermatology biopsied lesion and
pathology is still pending.
.
On [**2189-3-19**] patient experienced increasing respiratory distress
in the setting of known CM w/ EF <20%, and was receiving IVFs
for contrast induced nephropathy (ARF post CT w/ contrast), and
a. fib w/ RVR.  He was transferred to the CCU for further
management.  Lasix drip was started as was digoxin with good
effect.  He was transferred back to the floor on [**2189-3-22**] off
lasix drip and maintaining O2 sats on room air.

Physical Exam:

Gen: Gaunt, Caucasian gentleman, lying comfortably in bed, NAD
HEENT: Notable for 2x3cm erythematous, fluctuant area along L
nasal bridge and extending supperiorly to periorbital region
above L eye, and L superior lid. PERRL, EOMI, no conjunctival
injection, no pain on eye motion. Area is slightly warm and
tender to touch. As above, attempted needle aspiration yielded
tiny amount thick, yellow fluid.
Neck: Supple, no LAD
CV: [**Last Name (un) **] [**Last Name (un) 3526**], no m/r/g
Chest: Barrel chest, distant BS, no w/r/r
Abd: Scaphoid, soft, NT/ND, +BS
Extr: No pedal edema, DPs 1+ bilaterally
Neuro: A&Ox3, strength 5/5 throughout


Pertinent Results:
CTA brain [**3-14**]:
2.1X1.4 cm soft tissue mass on the left side of the nose with
peripheral enhancement, which is non-specific, and can be
infectious or neoplastic or neoplasm with infection. Soft tissue
swelling in front of left orbit, which may be due to spread of
infection. Clear paranasal sinues and no erosion to the nasal
bone. No evidence of spread of infection in the brain on this
CTA.
.
Small air bubbles in the rt orbit, in the bilateral internal
jugular veins, adjacent to the rt IJV at the level of clavicle
(which may be outside of vessels or in the small branches),
right side of the cavernous sinus, and in the subcutaneous
tissue posterior to the left orbital wall, of unknown etiology.
Clinical correlation is recommended. Emphysema. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11287**] was
informed. Official read awaits for 3D reformats.
.
TTE [**3-18**]: The left atrium is moderately dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). The right atrium is markedly dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with severe global hypokinesis. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to moderate ([**12-30**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a
restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial
pressure. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant
pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]M with h/o CAD, emphysema, gout, presenting with 2-3 day onset
of L nasal swelling, hospital course c/b hypoxia [**1-30**] to flash
pulmonary edema in setting of atrial fibrillation w/ RVR, and
IVFs for contrast induced nephropathy.
.
1. Nasal swelling: Differential included infection vs neoplasm
vs neoplasm with superimposed infection. Patient was initially
on vanco and zosyn for one week for presumed periorbital
cellulitis. Head CT showed no evidence of sinus involvement, but
did show unusual air bubbles in contralateral orbit, cavernous
sinus, as well as intravenously. Fluid collection was incised
and drained by plastics, frank pus was expressed. Gram stain
showed 1+ PMNs and cultures grew coag negative staph and
presumtive peptostreptococcus. Swelling improved, no
reaccumulation of fluid, incision site was healing well. Patient
continued to be afebrile with no leukocytosis. Presence of pus
was suggestive of infectious process. After first week of IV
vanc and zosyn, abx were switched to PO. Pt was on augmentin
since [**3-23**] for a total of 7 days (until [**3-29**]). Pathology was
still pending upon discharge. It is necessary to follow up on
these results.
.
2. Periorbital and intravascular air bubbles: Unclear etiology,
unclear whether clinically relevant. Possibly introduced during
contrast injection for CT study. Neurosurgery evaluated the
patient. Given no sign of intracranial involvement they
initially did not feel that there was anything to do, however
given air in cavernous sinus there was a concern for risk of
thrombosis. However, neurology evaluated the patient as well and
determined that risk of thrombosis was low, so no need for
anticoagulation. The patient'
