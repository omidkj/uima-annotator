Brief Hospital Course:
1. Sepsis: Pt was admitted to MICU with septic shock with
associated elevated WBC, fevers likely [**2-21**] MRSA pneumonia. No
other source of infection identified. Pt was give IVF
resussitation and started on pressors (levophed) and gradually
weaned off. He was pan cultured and started on broad spectrum
antibiotics of vanco (dosed for lvel <15), flagyl, zosyn (day
7). Sputum cultures grew MRSA. Urine and blood cultures remained
negative. Pt had inappropriate response to [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim test. Was
started on hydrocort (day [**6-26**]). Sepsis resolved.  Continued on
Vancomycin and Zosyn. Also emperically started on oral Flagyl
[**2-21**] loose stools, low grade fever.  On D/C pt. stable on Vanco
only, dosed at HD, to be continued for one week for MRSA
pneumonia.  Flagyl also to be continued for one week at the time
of discharge.  Zosyn D/C'd at time of discharge.
.
2. Respiratory failure: In the setting of sepsis and pneumonia.
Pt was weaned off the ventilator and successfully extubated on
[**3-18**].
.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: Pt has ESRD on HD. Pt
continued to be followed by renal with qod dialysis. All meds
were renally dosed and was given vanco by dose levels <15. Pt
was given phoslo for elevated phosphate and continued on epogen.

.
4. Cardiac: Cardiac enzymes cycled on admission with flat
enzymes. Pt has elevated Tn with negative CKMB in setting of
renal failure; no acute cardiac event. Unremarkable echo with EF
of 50-55% and mild focal hypokinesis. Pt was continued on ASA.
Antihypertensives were held in setting of intial hypotension. Pt
was restarted on lopressor after resolution of sepsis.

5. GI:s/p colectomy, g-j tube. G-J tube hub was noted to be
broken and was changed by IR on [**3-14**].
-cont TF via G-J tube given aspiration risk.

6. HEME - follow hematocrit

7. Neuro - baseline altered ms/aspiration on last discharge.
Much improved with decreased sedation and tx of sepsis

sundowning.  Responded well to 1 mg Haldol q hs.

After coming out of the MICU, the patient did well on the floor.
 He remained afebrile and blood cultures remained negative.  He
was continued on empiric therapy for vancomysin and clostridium
difficile and d/c'd back to [**Hospital **] [**Hospital **] Hospital on
