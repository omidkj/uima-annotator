Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catherization

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 81 yo female with no known CAD, but has a history of
HTN, Giant Cell Arteritis, renal-vascular disease, DM and
tobacco abuse who presented from OSH for cardiac catherization.
Early morning of admission, Pt became acutely SOB and was found
by EMS to be in respiratory distress secondary to pulmonary
edema and requiring emergent intubation.  Upon arival to the [**Name (NI) **],
Pt was stable but found to have dynamic evolving ECG changes
including anterior STEs and TWI through out.  Pt was given Lasix
100 mg IV with little initial result and thus started on
Natrecor.  Initital labs significant for negative cardiac
enzymes, BNP 1,010, WBC 15.2 with 4% bands and ABG 7.27/45/148.
CXR with diffuse pulmonary edema without any effusions.  Initial
treatments undertaken included ASA, heparin, ceftriaxone,
hydrocortisone, and albuterol nebulizer treatments. Pt
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catherization.

COMMENTS:     1.  Selective coronary angiography revealed single
vessel
disease.  The LMCA was angiographically normal.  The LAD had
mild
calcification with no flow limiting stenoses.  The LCx had mild
luminal
irregularities.  The RCA had an ostial 50% stenosis with serial
proximal
50-60% stenoses.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left-sided
filling
pressures (LVEDP 17mmHg).  Right-sided filling pressures were
mildly
elevated (RVEDP15mmHg, PA mean 26mmHg).  There was a 5-10mmHg
gradient
across the aortic valve on pullback c/w mild aortic stenosis.
There was
a 1-2mm Hg gradient between the PCWP and the LVEDP that would be

consistant with mild mitral stenosis.
3.  Left ventriculography was deferred.
4.  Peripheral angiography revealed moderate distal aortic
disease
(diffuse).  The left renal artery was subtotally occluded.  The
left
iliac artery was occluded proximally and the SFA reconstituted
distally
on the left via collaterals.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild aortic stenosis.
3. Mild mitral stenosis.
4. Mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.

CXR
[[**2136-10-2**]]IMPRESSION: Status-post intubation with endotracheal
tube in satisfactory position. No evidence of failure. No
evidence of pneumonia.

[[**2136-10-3**]]IMPRESSION: Continued cardiomegaly and CHF. Left lower
lobe opacity, which may represent atelectasis vs. pneumonia.
Please correlate clinically. Nodular opacity at the right apex,
overlying the right first rib, further evaluation by CT scan is
recommended.

CT
IMPRESSION:
1) Right upper lobe granulomatous disease, whose activity is
difficult to assess secondary to the lack of prior studies. As
such a 3 month follow up study is recommended to document
stability.

2) Congestive heart failure.

Additional lung findings include prominent septal thickening (in
the lower lobes), with bilateral pleural effusions and
cardiomegaly, consistent with congestive heart failure. There
are scattered areas of ground-glass opacity throughout both
lungs which could reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema or
resolving prior infection.

3) Slightly prominent mediastinal lymph nodes. These could be
reactive to the patient's CHF. These too can be reassessed on
the patient's follow up CT.

4) Prominent esophagus which could be secondary to lack of
distention. However, if the patient has symptoms, a barium
swallow may be useful to exclude other pathology.

ECHO
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and mild global
hypokinesis.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly
thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification leading
to mild
functional mitral stenosis. There is mild mitral regurgitation.
[Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly
UNDERestimated.] The pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild aortic stenosis. Mild functional mitral
stenosis. At least
mild mitral regurgitation. Symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with mild
global hypokinesis.
