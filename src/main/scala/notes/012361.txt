History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 yo retired farmer from [**Country 3587**] with PMH
significant for BPH with UTI indwelling foley, chronic UTIs, HTN
and one episode of endocarditis, 2+ MR/ 2+ AR, who presents with
respiratory distress, fatigue and dysarthria after being
discharged one day prior. He was discharged on [**12-3**] on cipro
with diagnosis UTI and Ecoli bacteremia. On the the afternoon of
discharge, his family noticed that he was less energetic, tired,
slower, stumbling gait and slurred speech. He was reportedly
able to answer questions appropriately, was oriented but was
difficult to understand. He has not had any facial droop, no
focal weakness or numbness.  He also developed respiratory
distress with heavy breathing and non-productive cough.

The patient currently feels as though his breathing is back to
normal. He denies CP, no abd pain, no N/V, + chills, + fever. He
denies any orthopnea or PND.

In the ED: He  desaturated to 88% in triage when laid flat, but
came up slowly to mid 90's on NRB. Initially, he was tx'ed for
asthma with nebs, solumedrol, magnesium. He was also tachypnic
to 30's and was breifly on BiPap 8/8 but was then taken off. His
RR came down to 18-20. His CXR then revealed a new RML
infiltrate, and he spiked a fever to 102.7. He was then
prescribed Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin and tylenol. His lacate
returned at 4.6 and his was given one liter just prior to
transfer.

Pertinent Results:
Ucx Ecoli [**11-30**]
[**Month/Year (2) **] Cx [**1-23**] 11/10 bottles Ecoli resistent to ampicillin and
bactrim
Subsequent [**Month/Day (2) **] cx's negative

EKG:  sinus tachycardia w/o ischemic changes

Radiologic Data:
CXR: new RML perihilar infiltrate, no edema, no effusions
Echo [**2123**]:The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and systolic function (LVEF 60-70%). No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of [**2121-12-16**], the aortic regurgitation may have
increased somewhat; right ventricular contractile dysfunction is
no longer evident.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 25709**]
Reason: ? stroke vs bleed
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   88 year old man with new dysarthria x 3 days.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   ? stroke vs bleed
CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR IV CONTRAST:
   None.
Provisional Findings Impression: SPfc SAT [**2128-12-4**] 10:57 AM
PFI: No change from [**2128-3-24**] and overall no acute
intracranial process.  If clinical suspicion exists for acute
infarction, MRI is a more sensitive modality for evaluation.

Final Report
INDICATION: Dysarthria for three days.
COMPARISON: [**2128-3-24**].
TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images were acquired through the head in the
absence of intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal
reformatted images were also
reviewed.

FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or vascular territorial infarction. Ventricles and sulci
are enlarged, consistent with parenchymal volume loss and
unchanged from the comparison study. There is cerebellar and
brainstem atrophy. Also unchanged is bilateral periventricular
white matter hypodensity, reflecting chronic microvascular
infarction. Scattered calcifications throughout the intracranial
parenchyma are unchanged. Note is made of bilateral carotid
siphon calcification as well as calcification in the V4 segments
of both vertebral arteries. There is no fracture. Included
paranasal sinuses reveal mild mucosal thickening bilaterally at
the ethmoid air cells, unchanged from the comparison study.

IMPRESSION: No change from [**2128-3-24**] and overall no acute
intracranial
process. If clinical suspicion exists for acute infarction, MRI
is a more
sensitive modality for evaluation.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 yo retired farmer from [**Country 3587**] with PMH
significant UTI indwelling foley, chronic UTIs, HTN and one
episode of endocarditis, 2+ MR/ 2+ AR, who presented with
respiratory distress, dysarthria and presumed pylonephritis.  He
was s/p admission [**Date range (1) 25710**] for UTI, treated with 3 days of IV
Cipro, discharged to complete an oral course of ciprofloxacin.
Of note, his admission [**Date range (1) **] cultures from [**11-30**] grew E. coli
(positive result returned after discharge).  After discharge, he
developed significant respiratory distress at home and
