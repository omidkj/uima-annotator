History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 76529**] is a 59 year old male with CHF, CAD, s/p 3 stents,
most recent [**10-25**], ESRD on [**Hospital **] transferred from [**Hospital1 5109**] with chest pain. The patient was in his USOH when he
went to scheduled HD on Friday [**3-31**]. HD was stopped early (only
3L removed, usually gets 4 L off) b/c he started to have
N/V/diarrhea. He went home had persistent symptoms until Sat
night when he developed L arm heaviness and pain, then CP,
consistent with his previous NSTEMI. He also was unable to take
his medications because of N/V. He reported dyspnea,
orthostatis, mild orthopnea. Denies PND, denies palpitations. He
presented to [**Hospital3 **] where he was noted to have
elevated Trop I (0.84), HTN to 220/110 (baseline 120-140 sys).
CXR was significant for pulmonary edema. He was started on nitro
gtt and given Lasix 60mg IV x1, zofran, lovenox. He also had a
leukocytosis to 12.3. OSH EKG: sinus tach, first degree av
block, LAD, marked LVH, peaked T waves in V3. ST depression in
I, aVL, and V6.
.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for care. His chest pain finally
resolved upon presentation to [**Hospital1 18**]. In our ED, the patient had
continued. Vital signs were afebrile, 162/78, 85, 18, 100% 2L.
His nitro glycerine drip was weaned given improving
hypertension. Labs were notable for elevated potassium 7.3,
repeat 6.8. He was given insulin, calcium, and glucose.
Kayexalate was initially refused and renal was going to dialyse
him, but he then accepted kayexalate. Heparin gtt was started.
.
On the floor, he denies chest pain. Of note, he has had similar
in the past and he has been found to have MI latest in [**1-25**], at
which time his stent was restenosed, he underwent PTCA.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, black stools or red stools. He reports chronic
symptoms of PVD. He reports orthostatic symptoms with presyncope
before reporting to OSH ED. He has had body aches for the past
few days, but no fevers/chills. All of the other review of
systems were negative.


Past Medical History:
CHF
CAD s/p 3 stents in [**8-25**] with PTCA for instent stenosis [**1-25**]
(hospital records pending from [**Hospital1 2177**])
ESRD
hyperparathyroidism (likely from renal)
.
Cardiac Risk Factors: ESRD, Hypertension, tobacco, FH

CXR:
In comparison to the previous radiograph, there is increased
perihilar haziness and newly occurred interstitial fluid
accumulation, manifesting by Kerley B lines and peribronchial
cuffing. Overall, these findings suggest increasing interstitial
lung edema of moderate severity. The size of the cardiac
silhouette is unchanged, pleural effusions are not seen. No
pulmonary opacities suggestive of pneumonia.

IMPRESSION: Increasing interstitial pulmonary edema of moderate
severity.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN, TO BE REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED IN
MULTIDISCIPLINARY ROUNDS:
59 year old male with CAD s/p multiple stents, CHF, ESRD on HD
who is transferred from OSH with hyperkalemia, chest pain and
positive troponins.
.
# CAD/Ischemia: had chest pain associated with elevated blood
pressure. Has recent history of PCI and MI as above. His
troponins were elevated slightly but his CKs were flat, making
acute ACS, especially in the setting of ESRD, very unlikely. His
pain was likely from some minor sub-endocardial ischemia in the
setting of volume overload and ventricular stretch. There was no
indication for cardiac catheterization. The patient was dialyzed
as below with no recurrence of his chest pain. He as continued
on his aspirin, plavix, statin, beta-blocker, norvasc, ACE.
.
# Pump: No echo on system, has a history of CHF. ECHO from OSH
show inferolat hypokinesis, latest EF 50-55%. CXR shows mild
congestive failure. ProBNP [**Numeric Identifier 76530**]. The patient became acutely SOB
overnight on admission in association with systolic BP in the
190s, and an exam consistent with flash pulmonary edema. The
patient was emergently dialyzed in the ICU with good results. He
received two total dialysis treatments, each removing 4 liters
of fluid. He was weened to room air on discharge and feeling
very well. There was no indication for a repeat TTE.
.
# HTN: The patient was poorly controlled on his home regimen.
Given his renal disease he was begun on Lisinopril with
uptitration to 40mg PO daily. He was also starteded on Toprol XL
at an increased dose. His isordil was converted to Imdur for
easier dosing, and his hydralazine was discontinued. He had good
control with this regimen.
.
# ESRD: Needed HD x2 as noted above. Continued on calcium
acetate, sevalemer, and sensipar
.
# FEN: diabetic, heart healthy diet.
.
# Prophylaxis: Heparin sc, [**Last Name (un) 12376**] regimen
.
# Code: FULL - confirmed with patient
.
# Communication: with patient
.
# Dispo: pending above
