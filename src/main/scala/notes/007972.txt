Chief Complaint:
respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation, PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
76 yo M tranferred from [**Hospital6 **] intubated with
pneumococcal pneumonia. Patient developed malaise and anorexia
starting [**4-6**] then cough, congestion, and dypnea starting [**4-8**].
He was admitted to [**Hospital6 33**] with hypoxia and a R
sided infiltrate.  Initially was hypotensive to the 70's,
hypoxic to 80's on NRB, with a WBC of 40k. He required 10 L of
IVF for resucitation hypotension and oligouria. He was intubated
after a short attempt at mask ventillation. Urine pneumococcus
antigen was positive and sputum grew pan-sensitive pneumococcus.
His antibiotics were then switched from CTX/Azith to PCN. He has
had poor mental recovery despite decreased sedation for the last
two days of his hospitalization. Head CT and LP were wnl.
Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work up. On [**4-14**] pt had a
short episode of atrial fibrillation documented on ECG which
resolved with IV dilt. Since being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] he has
been in sinus rhythm.

[**2129-4-16**] EKG: Sinus rhythm. Normal ECG. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2128-11-3**] no significant change

Radiology
[**2129-4-16**] Chest CT: Dense multifocal opacities are seen within the
right lung and left lung base consistent with multifocal
pneumonia. No cavitary lesion is detected. There are small
bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. Note is
made of calcified aortic valve which may suggest aortic stenosis
and can correlate with echocardiography if warrented. No filling
defect is identified within the pulmonary arteries. There are
multiple prominent mediastinal nodes the largest of which is a
right paratracheal node measuring 18 x 9 mm. Enlarged lymph
nodes are also seen within the left axilla, the largest measures
2.0 x 1.2 cm. The left lobe of the thyroid is enlarged and
measures 3.0 x 3.5 cm. ET tube is present. Diffuse
atherosclerotic calcification is seen within the aorta and
coronaries. Visualized upper abdomen demonstrates
cholelithiasis. NG tube is curled within the stomach.

[**2129-4-16**] RUQ U/S: Limited evaluation of the right upper quadrant
demonstrates a liver with normal echogenicity without focal
lesion. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation.
A decompressed gallbladder is present containing multiple
stones. There is no pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder wall
edema to suggest cholecystitis. Portal vein is patent with
hepatopetal flow. Note is made of renal cyst at the upper pole.

[**2129-4-17**] MRI of head with and without contrast: There is
opacification of the mastoid sinus air cells as well as
scattered areas of mucosal thickening in the ethmoid sinuses.
There is an air-fluid level in the nasopharynx. These findings
are all consistent with intubation. There is no midline shift,
mass effect or hydrocephalus. There are scattered foci of
increased T2 signal within the periventricular and subcortical
white matter of both cerebral hemispheres most consistent with
chronic microvascular ischemic changes. There is no area of slow
diffusion to indicate an acute infarct. There are no enhancing
abnormalities.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of an acute infarct or enhancing
abnormalities. Tiny amounts of chronic microvascular ischemic
change.

[**2129-4-18**] transthoracic echocardiogram: The left atrium is mildly
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area
1.2-1.9cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. No vegetation/mass is seen on
the pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2129-4-20**] CT Neck: No fluid collections are identified within the
neck. Enlargement of the left lobe of the thyroid is unchanged
compared to four days prior. Lung windows of the apices
partially image patient's known multifocal opacities on the
right. Bone windows reveal no acute fractures or dislocation. No
spondylolisthesis is identified. Tiny avulsion injuries off the
posterosuperior aspect of the C4 and C5 vertebral bodies appear
old. Scattered calcifications of the anterior longitudinal
ligament and ligamentum flavum are also observed. Vertebral body
heights appear preserved.

[**2129-4-23**] CXR PA/lat: PA and lateral views of the chest are
obtained [**2129-4-23**] at 13:42 hours and compared with the prior
radiograph of [**2129-4-21**]. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unchanged. Again seen is bilateral interstitial edema which
appears to be slightly increased since the previous examination.
Patchy opacities at the right base and right midlung persists.
New opacity developing in the left mid lung zone and in the
right upper lobe.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 year old male tranferred from [**Hospital6 **] intubated
with pneumococcal pneumonia and resuscitated septic shock.

1) Pneumococcal pneumonia/respiratory failure: The patient was
admitted to the intensive care unit intubated. He was initially
covered with vancomycin/Zosyn, subsequently changed to
Penicillin alone, and completed a 14 day course. His ventilation
was managed per ARDS-NET protocol and he was extubated on [**2129-4-18**]
and transferred to the general medical floor on [**2129-4-21**]. His
respiratory status remained stable on the floor and, at time of
discharge, he was 96% on room air. This is the patient's second
severe pneumonia within the
