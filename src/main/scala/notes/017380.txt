History of Present Illness:
This 70 year old white female has a long history of coronary
artery disease, having an infarction at age 36. At age 60
another infarction occurred and 4 stents were deployed.
Recurrent chest pressure began last week and she went to to ED.
Again several days later she went to the ED with this complaint
and infarction was ruled out. Catheterization [**3-16**] revealed
triple vessel disease and she was transferred for surgical
revascularization.  There was a question of aortic occlusive
disease at catheterization, although there was no difficulty to
access the right femoral artery or closing it with a device.

Impression: Right ICA stenosis 70-79%.  Left ICA stenosis

[**2122-3-17**] CTA
1. Aberrant right subclavian artery, with an abnormal
configuration of the
aortic arch as described above. There is significant
atherosclerotic disease involving the right subclavian artery,
with a thrombosed and slightly enlarged proximal portion, which
may represent a thrombosed aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm, measuring
1.5cm, with mass effect on the esophagus. Rec. Vascular/INR
consult for dx angiogram for better assessment.
2. Atherosclerotic disease involving the carotid bifurcations
bilaterally,
with approximately 50% stenosis on the right and 25% stenosis on
the left by NACET criteria.
3. Unremarkable CTA of the head.
4. Small focal area of hypodensity in the inferior left
occipital lobe may
represent an area of old encephalomalacia. There are no findings
to suggest an acute infarct. Other details as above.
5. Multilevel DJD changes are noted in the cervical spine,
inadequately
assessed. A few sclerotic lesions noted which are indeterminate.
Consider
clinical correlation and if necessary radionuclide study as the
pt. cannot
have MRI due to pacemaker.

Final Report
INDICATION: 70-year-old female with chest tube removal.
CHEST, AP: A left pleural drain has been removed, with no
residual
pneumothorax or effusion. The lungs are clear. A left chest wall
pacemaker
has leads overlying the right atrium and ventricle. Median
sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips from prior CABG. Mild
cardiomegaly is unchanged. The mediastinal and hilar contours
are normal.
IMPRESSION: Left chest tube removal, without complications.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. Mild
regional LV systolic dysfunction. Low normal LVEF. No resting
LVOT gradient.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion. RV
hypertrophy.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Physiologic MR (within normal limits).
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Physiologic
TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial
effusion cannot be excluded.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of
the inferior and inferolateral walls. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The remainder of
the ventricle contracts well. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior
space which most likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Mild right ventricular hypertrophy. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 86745**] was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2122-3-16**] from [**Hospital **]
Hospital after a cardiac catheterization revealed severe triple

manner including a carotid ultrasound which revealed a 70-79%
