History of Present Illness:
71 year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of
lung [**2172**] s/p R VATs and RLL basilar segmentectomy, organizing
pneumonitis and follicular bronchiolitis, COPD (FEV1 81%, on 4L
NC at home) who presents for respiratory distress.  Awakened
overnight with severe dyspnea, which had been worsening
thoughout the day. EMS called and found patient in resp distress
with O2 sats in the 60's. He was placed on NRB w/ only slight
increase in O2 sat then placed on CPAP w/ O2 sats into the low
80s (poor fitting [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] report).

sat 56% on non-rebreather. Immediately placed onto BIPAP and
started on nebs w/ increase O2 sats to 100% and decreased work
of breathing. Patient was given 125mg methylprednisolone, 750mg
IV levofloxacin and 3 albuterol nebulizers and 3 ipratropium

Imaging:

FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates normal
cardiomediastinal silhouette. Rightward tracheal deviation
appears
longstanding.  There is worsening bilateral widespread reticular
opacities can be explained by progressive pulmonary fibrosis,
but concurrent pulmonary edema is certainly possible. There is
no pleural effusion

IMPRESSION: Progressive pulmonary fibrosis and severe
centrilobular emphysema.
Concurrent pulmonary edema is possible.


Brief Hospital Course:
71 year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of
lung [**2172**] s/p R VATs and RLL basilar segmentectomy, organizing
pneumonitis and follicular bronchiolitis, COPD (FEV1 67%, on 4L
NC at home) who presents for respiratory distress.

# Hypoxia: Pt has an extensive history of lung pathology
including COPD, organizing pneumonitis/follicular bronchiolitis
using 4L NC at home. There was concern that this might be acute
exacerbation of interstitial lung disease versus possible
infectious process given leukocytosis.  Specifically, patient
denied recent illness and denied any changes in cough/orthopnea.
 He did not meet criteria for HCAP as he was discharged >3
months ago.  Pt's recent PET/CT showed concerning signs of
infectious/ inflammatory process in lungs. The pt received a
three day course of IV methylprednisolone 80mg and was then
transitioned to prednisone 60mg PO. Patient will need a 2 week
taper that is outlined below.  Fungal markers were negative.  Pt
also received a 7 day course of ceftriaxone and a five day
course of azithromycin. Pt was slowly weaned down on FiO2 with
supplementation with albuterol and ipratropium with the goal of
having pt back on home O2 requirement of 4-5L. Upon discharge,
pt was still on facemask humidifier 35% in addition to 5L NC. Pt
is to finish 5 day course of azithromycin and will switch from
ceftriaxone to cefpodoxime and finish a 7 day course at rehab.

# Chronic steroid use: Received burst therapy for inflammation.
Will have taper as below. Pt has been on oral steroids on
chronic basis and was initially on Bactrim SS. We switched pt to
Bactrim DS and continued Vitamin D and calcium supplementation.
Pt is to continue once weekly Vit D 50,000 U for two months and
then transition to daily Vit D 1000 U.

# Hypertension: Patient was on metoprolol as an outpatient.
Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **] was started and BP remained
in 120-130s.

# History of depression/ anxiety: Pt was euthymic throughout
hospital course and was continued on citalopram, mirtazepine,
and lorazepam.

# History of restless legs: Pt was continued on Ropinirole 0.25
mg PO/NG QPM 1 hour before bedtime.

# BPH: continued Tamsulosin 0.4 mg PO HS

# Gout: Not active. continued allopurinol 100mg daily.

# GERD: Not active. continued Omeprazole 20 mg PO DAILY

# Back pain/Osteoperosis: Tylenol prn.
