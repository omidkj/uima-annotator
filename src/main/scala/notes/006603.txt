Radiology:
 - [**1-26**] MRI Lumbar Spine: IMPRESSION: 1. Stable superior
endplate loss of height of T11 level, likely representing a
Schmorl's node vs chronic compression deformity. No evidence of
significant thoracic spinal canal narrowing. No epidural abscess
is identified.  2. Unchanged moderate lumbar spondylosis as
described above.

 - [**1-27**] TTE: IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and severely depressed
global left ventricular systolic function. Given suboptimal
image quality a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Elevated left ventricular filling pressures. Depressed
right ventricular systolic function. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. At least mild to
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Compared with
the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-6-1**], overall left
ventricular systolic function has decreased (LVEF 45-50%
previously, now 20-25%) and the focal wall motion abnormalities
appreciated previously appear to be more global, although a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation
and mild tricuspid regurgitation are new. The pulmonary artery
pressures were not previously determined but are at least mild
to moderate.
.
[**1-27**] Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis CT: IMPRESSION: 1. Air within cervical
soft tissues, mediastinal and vasculature likely related to
intubation and central line placement. 2. No etiology for fever
identified.
.
[**1-31**] RUQ US: IMPRESSION: No evidence of biliary obstruction.
.
MRI L spine [**2-7**] IMPRESSION:
1. No definite evidence of discitis osteomyelitis. No evidence
of epidural
abscess.
2. Partially imaged and incompletely evaluated on this exam,
there is
stranding of the right perirenal fat. If clinically warranted,
CT or
ultrasound of the kidneys may be performed for further
characterization. It is noted that the patient underwent a renal
ultrasound on [**2174-1-27**] which did not show this
a
