History of Present Illness:
61 year old female with a complicated past medical history
including DMI s/p pancreas transplant, CABG, NSTEMIs, CHF, ESRD
s/p renal transplants, now on peritoneal HD, CHF and recent
admissions for hypotension presenting with hypotension and
anemia.

She apparently had a hematocrit drawn earlier this week at her
rehab facility and found that it was 24.  On the day of
admission, she asked her rehab staff to check her hct again and
it was found to be 19 so she presented to the ED.  At her last
discharge it was discussed that she needed outpatient
transfusions for chronic anemia and was supposed to start
getting these beginning [**7-11**].  Of note, the patient reports
daily nosebleeds for the last three months which wet about 3
tissues before resolution.  She denies any BRBPR or melena.
Stool guaiac was negative.  She has chronic diarrhea but reports
an increase in frequency of stooling to [**7-2**] time daily while at
rehab which as resolved with PO vanc and loperamide.  She does
report new pain during stooling for the last few weeks.  She
denies abdominal pain at rest.

Per records she has orthostatic hypotension at baseline and
takes midodrine and fludrocortisone, but felt that she had
worsened in the last week.  She also complains of
lightheadedness, fatigue, and "decreased executive functioning."
 She apparently has baseline low blood pressure to the 80s-90s.
Of note, during her previous admission to [**Hospital1 18**] (d/c on [**6-17**])
she was treated with IVF for hypotension, and given
vanc/meropenam for concern for sepsis.  At this time she also
had diarrhea thought to be from viral gastroenteritis which
self-resolved and she was discharged to rehab.
She also complains of thickening nails beginning 3 months ago
and a painful purpuric rash appearing on her hads a few days
ago.  Dermatology has been consulted and recommended urea cream.
 She also complains of painless darkened elbows for around two
weeks.

In the ED initial VS were 99.8 70 83/48 18 99% RA.  Labs notable
for WBC 2.4, Hct 19.5, platelets 123, INR 2.7.  Stool guaiac was
negative.  CXR no acute process, blood cx sent, and pt was
written for transfuse 1 unit PRBC but had not received yet.  BPs
initially in mid 80s systolic, improved during history taking
and with stimulation during exam.  Given 250 mL of NS small
bolus given h/o heart failure.  Lactate wnl and no obvious
infectious source, afebrile so did not start antibiotics.
Unable to obtain peritoneal dialysis fluid in ED.  Pt with 18g
PIV x 2 for access.
