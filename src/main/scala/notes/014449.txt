[**5-2**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: 1. The left atrium is normal in size. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 2. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. 3. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. 4. The descending thoracic aorta is
markedly dilated. There is evidence of intramural hematoma/graft
in the distal descending thoracic aorta. 5. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 6. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen.
POST- R heart BYPASS:
Pt removed from partial R heart bypass on phenylephrine infusion
and was in normal sinus rhythm. 1. Valves as noted pre-bypass.
2. No evidence of dissection in the ascending or distal aortic
arch post-decannulation or post graft placement.


RADIOLOGY  Final Report
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2199-5-14**] 2:30 PM
CHEST (PA & LAT)
Reason: assess for effusions/infiltrates
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
50 year old woman s/p thoracoabdm AAA repair
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess for effusions/infiltrates
HISTORY: Postoperative AAA repair.
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**5-10**], there is little
change. Increased opacification at the left base extending along
the lateral chest wall is again seen. The atelectatic streaks at
the right base have cleared and the right lung shows no evidence
of pneumonia. PICC line remains in place.

Reason: s/p redo throcoabdominal abdominal aortic aneurysm
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
throcoabdominal abdominal aortic aneursym
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
s/p redo throcoabdominal abdominal aortic aneurysm
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.
HISTORY: 50-year-old female with multiple thoracoabdominal
aortic surgeries, for reassessment.
TECHNIQUE: CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed
without intravenous contrast followed by CT of the chest,
abdomen and pelvis post- administration of intravenous contrast,
reconstructions were performed in the axial, sagittal, and
coronal planes. Reconstructions were also performed in the 3D
imaging lab.
COMPARISON: There is no prior examination at this institution.
Comparison was made with the available outside study.
FINDINGS:
CT CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
There is a left basal effusion with atelectasis most likely
related to recent surgery. There are scattered subcentimeter
mediastinal lymph nodes. There is no pericardial effusion.
CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
There are bilateral renal hypodensities, likely cysts. There is
hypoperfusion at the lower pole and the interpolar cortex of the
left kidney suggestive of ischemia/infarction. The liver,
spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas appear unremarkable. The
gallbladder is unremarkable. There are scattered subcentimeter
upper abdominal lymph nodes. There is inflammatory change and
fluid in the left upper quadrant abutting the spleen and the
aortic graft, most likely postoperative.
CT PELVIS PRE- AND POST-ADMINISTRATION OF INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:
There is free fluid in the pelvis, which may represent sequela
of the recent abdominal surgery. There are tubal clips seen in
situ. There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy. There is colonic
diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
MUSCULOSKELETAL:
There is extensive subcutaneous edema along the left lower
thoracic and abdominal wall, most likely sequelae of recent
surgery. There are no worrisome bone lesions.
CT ANGIOGRAM:
There is a bovine arch. The patient has had multiple abdominal
aortic operations. The ascending aorta at the level of the right
main pulmonary artery measures 31 x 29 mm, and the descending
thoracic aorta at the level of the left inferior pulmonary vein
measures 40 x 42 mm. There is no central or segmental pulmonary
embolism or aortic dissection.
There has been a reanastomosis of the abdominal aortic branches.
The celiac trunk shows short segment focal stenosis with
post-stenotic dilatation. The luminal diameter at the stenosis
is 5 x 4 mm and the post-stenotic luminal diameter is 9 x 10 mm.
The superior mesenteric artery is patent. The inferior
mesenteric artery fills in retrogradely. The right and left
renal arteries are patent. The iliac vessels are diminutive in
caliber, although these are patent.
CONCLUSION:
1. Patent aortoiliac graft and abdominal vasculature with
minimally short segment stenosis of the celiac artery with
post-stenotic dilatation as described above.
2. Left basal effusion with atelectasis should be followed up
with a chest CT to ensure resolution in two months.
3. Areas of hypoperfusion in the left kidney are most likely
ischemic. There are multiple bilateral renal hypodensities
likely cysts.
4. Anasarca along the left chest and upper abdominal wall and
fluid in the upper abdomen and the pelvis are most likely
sequelae of the recent surgical intervention.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit after undergoing all
pre-operative work-up as an outpatient. On day of admission she
was brought directly to the operating room where she underwent a
redo thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Following surgery she was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Infectious disease was consulted on post-op day one
following GPC found at anastomosis site of graft from prior
aneurysm repair and she remained on vanocmycin. Patient remained
intubated for several days as she was a difficult intubation and
required significant flu
