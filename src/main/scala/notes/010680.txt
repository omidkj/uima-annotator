Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
74 y/o F with PMHx significant for  dCHF, HTN, HL, DM, who was
transferred from and OSH with respiratory failure s/p
intubation. She initially presented to the OSH on [**2167-2-3**]. At
that time, she was referred from her podiatrist's office with
complaints of dyspnea, lethargy, and respiratory distress. She
had also had a nonproductive cough for the past few weeks; she
lives with her son, who had recently had a respiratory
infection.

She was initially intubated for respiratory failure from [**2-4**] to
[**2-8**]. She required reintubation on [**2-9**] because of worsening
respiratory failure. At the OSH, blood cx were positive for
H.flu, and sputum GS was significant for GPC in pairs and GN
coccobacilli resembling H.flu. CXRs were significant for
bilateral pleural effusions, the right of which was tapped. Cx
data from here thoracentesis was not available at the time of
transfer. The patient's hosptial course was also significant for
development of episodes of sinus pauses, lasting ~7 seconds on
telemetry. Reportedly, these episodes responded to atropine;
however, the patient did have a temporary pacer placed. Also, of
note, on the day of transfer, the patient was noted to have an
elevated in her troponin to 0.38 (from 0.02 previously). She was
transferred from the OSH to the CCU for further evaluation of
what was thought, according to the transfer note, to be
worsening heart failure in the setting of PAF, high grade AVB
with sinus exit block, and possible ischemia.

On arrival to the CCU, the patient's VS were T= 99.6 BP= 120/64
HR= 92 RR= 24 O2 sat= 98% on CMV/Assist 450x14 with PEEP of 5
and FiO2 of 40%. She was able to to nod appropriately to
questions. She denied any pain at that time. Other ROS was
unable to be obtained, as the patient was intubated.

OSH ECG's: A.fib; HR 60's to 100's; Left axis; slight ST
depressions in II, aVF; slight ST elevation in aVR; noteable for
decreased voltage compared to prior ECG; ECGs without any
dynamic changes over the past few days

TELEMETRY: OSH telemetry significant for a 7 second sinus pause


2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM (OSH): Maintained systolic function,
hyperdynamic LV (EF 60-70%), moderate aortic sclerosis, trace
MR, [**12-31**]+ TR, moderate to severe pHTN

CXRs (OSH): bilateral pleural effusions, vascular congestion,
bibasilar atelectasis, ?right perihilar infiltrate
CXR at [**Hospital1 18**] (my read): bilateral pleural effusions with
blunting of the costophrenic angles, increased opacification in
the right lower lung, can't rule out infiltrate

[**2167-2-13**]- TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 1.2-1.9cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is severe
mitral annular calcification. There is mild functional mitral
stenosis (mean gradient XXmmHg) due to mitral annular
calcification. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2167-2-14**] -CT chest without contrast
1. Moderate-to-large bilateral simple pleural effusions.
Evidence of
loculation, right more than left. Focal RML consolidative
density is
concerning for focal pneumonia.
2. Moderate bibasilar atelectasis.
3. Moderate cardiomegaly with heavily calcified mitral annulus.
4. Moderate anasarca.
.
CXR [**2167-2-18**]
: The patient has been extubated. There has been a corresponding

decrease in lung volumes with extensive increased bibasilar
opacities, which
are compatible with either atelectasis or consolidations. There
is also an
increase in interstitial markings and pulmonary vascularity
suggesting
interstitial edema. There is no pneumothorax. The
moderate-to-large
left-sided effusion is probably increased in size and probably
for the most
part free flowing. Increased right basilar opacification
probably reflects
increased atelectasis with a likely similar size of the
small-to-moderate
right-sided effusion.

IMPRESSION: Increased bibasilar opacities and left pleural
effusion following
extubation.


Brief Hospital Course:
74 y/o F with PMHx significant for dCHF, HTN, HL, DM, who was
admitted OSH with respiratory failure, intubated. Recent
hospital course complicated by persistent respiratory failure,
bilateral pleural effusions, Afib with RVR and development of
sinus pauses on telemetry raising concern for sick sinus
syndrome.
.
# Respiratory Failure: She was admitted intubated from an
outside hospital due to respiratory distress. This was thought
to be multifactorial, related to pneumonia and heart failure.
Culture data from the outside hospital showed that she had an
H.influenza pneumonia. She was found to have a left loculated
pleural effusion on chest x-ray and subsequently underwent
thoracentesis, with removal of 1.6 L of fluid. She had initially
been treated with ceftriaxone at the outside hospital. She later
became febrile and this was switched to vancom
