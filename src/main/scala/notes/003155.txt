fatigue. The pt states that he has been relatively healthy until
~1-2 months ago when he was admitted to NWH for weakness,
malaise, for an unclear diagnosis. He states since then he has
been placed on several different medications with varying
diagnoses but doesn't feel like he's gotten accurate, consistent
care. For the last few wks the pt has been increasingly sob,
with increasing weakness over the past several days, anorexia
for 3 days and nausea. Of note, the pt's son states that the pt
takes his medications inconsistently. He puts them in his pocket
and takes them throughout the day. Per the pt he has not taken
his meds in several days, except for the levoxyl. Also of note,

of late, not having the same exuberance or interest in taking
care of himself as before.

satting in the 80s on RA. He was in afib with a HR 129, 122/69
30 91%4L O2. He had a WBC 29.2, HCT 50, lactate 2.2, cr 1.7. He
was given 3L NS. Bcx were sent. A cxr demonstrated multifocal
pna and he was started on vanc, cefepime, levaquin.
.
On the floor the pt was 98.3 130 120/70 34 84%5L. He was
comfortable, complained of being thirsty, and weak. He was
continued on broad spectrum antibiotics, given PO fluids, and
another 1L NS. The pt was also found to have LLE swelling for
which he had LENIs that were negative.

TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. [Intrinsic right
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
very small pericardial effusion.

CXR: [**8-31**]
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar, right greater than left, pulmonary
opacities could
reflect aspiration or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
setting. Small
bilateral effusions.

LENIs:
IMPRESSION: No DVT in both lower extremities.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]M with hx of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], HTN, HL who p/w sob and
fatigue with imaging concerning for multifocal PNA.
.
# Multifocal pna: The pt presented with complaints of sob,
fatigue, found to be hypoxic, with cxr c/w multifocal pna and
wbc 29. Pt was started on vanc/cefepime/levaquin as concern for
hcap given recent hospitalization. Given 3L ns in the ED for
lactate 2.2. Given hypoxia, tachycardia, tachypnea in setting of
polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **], concern re: dvt, however lenis neg.  He was
started on vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin.  He was also
given nebulizer.  His respiratory status remained tenuous
requiring high flow and NRB, but he requested to be on morphine
and ativan for comfort in the MICU as well.  Family meeting was
held and there was plan to transition to CMO. He was transferred
to floor, pain controlled and he expired on [**2188-9-4**].
.
# [**Last Name (un) **]: Pt presented with cr 1.7 unclear baseline.  Initially
thought to be pre-renal as he had very poor po intake x 3 days
prior to presentation.  However, even after 4L of IVF,
creatinine remained stable.  It is possible that this could have
been his baseline.
.
# Afib with RVR: pt presented in afib with rvr 120s-140s. Pt
states he may have had afib in the past, and he is on a high
dose of beta blockade. RVR likely [**12-26**] not taking meds for
several days compounded by hypovolemia and infection.  However,
despite multiple agents- lopressor, diltiazem, and digoxin-
patient continued to be in RVR.  Because of AF with RVR, he also
had one episode of pulmonary flash which improved with
additional beta blockade and diuresis.  However, HR was unable
to be optimally controlled.  He was continued on ASA.  CKMB was
flat.  Family meeting was held to discuss next plan as there was
plan to transition to comfort only.
.
# Polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **]: Patient with hx of pv treated with
phlebotomy for HCT >45. HCT currently 50 on admission. Trended
during admission
.
# HL: Held lovastatin while acutely ill
.
# BPH: continue finasteride
.
# Code: DNR/DNI
# Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
.
Transitions of care: patient expired on [**2188-9-4**] in the context
of being CMO.
