History of Present Illness:
44 yo F with PMH significant for CAD s/p multiple PCIs and MI in
[**2193-1-4**] who presented to [**Hospital3 1443**] with [**Hospital 7792**]
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**6-1**] for
cardiac catheterization. It was determined that she was not a
surgical candidate at that time.  She was readmitted [**8-30**] with
left arm pain and chest pressure. She was found to have
thrombosis of her left subclavian stent. Vascular was consulted
and it was determined that the left arm likely being perfused by
vertebral artery and she was admitted and started on a heparin
drip. Follow up appointment with Vascular was arranged for post
cardiac surgery.  Csurg was reconsulted to evaluate for CABG.

Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Left-to-right shunt
across the interatrial septum at rest. Small secundum ASD.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness. Mild-moderate
regional LV systolic dysfunction. Moderately depressed LVEF.
[Intrinsic LV systolic function likely depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
Prebypass

A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. A small secundum atrial septal defect is present. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
akinesia of the apex, apical and mid portions of the inferior
wall and hypokinesia of the inferoseptal and inferolateral
walls.. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 35-40%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a stent noted in the distal arch of the aorta that has
a possible clot in it. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person
