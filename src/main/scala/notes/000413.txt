Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**4-12**] Right-sided crani for evac of subdural hematoma


History of Present Illness:
81 year-old male with history of CHF, atrial fibrillation,
ascending aortic aneurysm and mitral regurgitation who is
admitted with dyspnea and failure to thrive.
.
The patient's daughter reports that the patient has been sick
for "a while", particularly since he was admitted in [**2119-2-22**].
Since his discharge, he was improving and doing better at home
until three days ago when he started declining rather rapidly.
She reports that he has had shortness of breath, slurred speech
and difficulty walking over the last three days. He has also
been confused and falling asleep in his chair and falling out of
the chair and from his bed. He has been refusing help, but
unable to get up. She also reports that her father has had
decreased grip strength and things have been falling out of his
hands. As a result of his confusion, he has been eating less,
though he has been very thirsty and is drinking a lot of fluids.
There have been no fevers, chills, night sweats, cough, emesis,
diarrhea. She also reports "difficulty with motor planning", as
if he had trouble "putting one foot in front of the other".
Interestingly, his mental status has been waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**].
Although he has been confused, he was able to have a completely
coherent conversation with his sister yesterday. [**Name2 (NI) **] was recently
on Coumadin but this was held secondary to fall risk.
.
In the ED, he was given 100mg of IV Lasix and ASA 325mg x 1.
.
Today, the patient states that his main concern is his shortness
of breath. He has been feeling dyspneic over the last several
days. Has a mild cough, non-productive. No chest pain or
palpitations. Denies edema. Reports orthopnea but no PND.

Pertinent Results:
Head CT ([**4-1**]): Moderate right subdural hemorrhage with
associated subfalcine herniation.
.
CTA ([**4-1**]): New CHF with enlarging moderate/large bilateral
pleural effusions with concomitant atelectasis.  No evidence for
pulmonary embolus
.
Head CT ([**4-2**]):  No significant change from prior study with
right-sided pleural hematoma and subfalcine herniation again
seen.
.
EKG ([**4-2**]): very wavy baseline, largely uninterpretable secondary
to motion, afib with HR 100s, no ST changes (but diff to
interpret)
.
Renal US ([**4-2**]): No evidence of hydronephrosis or stones.
.
Echo ([**4-3**]): LVEF>55%. Significant aortic regurgitation is
present, but cannot be quantified. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. At least, moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen.
.
Head CT ([**4-3**]): Stable appearance of the right-sided subdural
hematoma and stable to mildly improved subfalcine herniation
.
Abd US ([**4-4**]): No focal or textural hepatic abnormality is
identified. Patent portal vein with hepatopetal flow. Mild
splenomegaly. Small amount of ascites.
.
Head CT ([**4-4**]): Stable appearance of a large right subdural
hematoma
.
CXR ([**4-5**]): Cardiomegaly, bilateral effusions, and borderline
vascular congestion with little interval change
.
Head CT [**4-14**] evacuation of hematoma stable.
.
Head CT [**4-17**] hematoma stable.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. altered mental status -
He was admitted with subacute course of non-specific mental
status changes and was found to have a chronic appearing with
superimposed acute features subdural hemorrhage. He was followed
by neurosurgery, who deferred evacuation on account of the
stability of the SDH as well as his concomitant medical issues
(liver failure,
renal failure, UTI, CHF).
.
His mental status was poor with marked delirium, but remained
stable. Serial head CTs demonstrated stable subdural hemorrhage.
Pt was taken to the operating room on [**4-12**] for a right crani for
evacuation of Subdural hematoma.  [**Name (NI) **] pt was extubated and
reintubated within 1 hr.  Pt had aggressive pulm toilet and self
extubated overnoc on [**5-2**].  Drain removed [**4-13**].  Pt
currently doing well extubated.  Staples to be dc'd [**4-21**].  .
   Patient transferred to Neurosurgery service on [**2119-4-12**] for
subdural hematoma evacuation after become medically stable. His
INR has been stable under 1.3. His mental status improved over
the course of time, as his electrolytes, and coags improved. His
initial INR went up as high as 1.8 which stayed around the same
level until given factor VIIa  on [**4-5**] then stayed around
1.2-1.3 range per recommendation of Hematology service. His
creatinine improved greatly, his creatinine jumped up to 2.5,
but now dropped down to 1.5 renal service has been following
along.  He is cleared by medicine team to be operated on his
subdural hematoma. He had a left lower lobe pneumonia which is
treated with Levo. He had a hypernatremia Na up to 157 on [**4-11**],
eventually corrected with fluid.
.
He underwent right craniotomy on [**2119-4-12**]  for evacuation of
subdural hematoma and placement of subdural JP drain placement
under general anesthesia without complications, he was able to
extubated in [**Hospital **] transferred to PACU, however 2 hour later he
required re-intubation secondary to hypoventilation. He is
neurologically moving all extremities, opens his eyes to voice
intermittently, squeezes to command. He placed on a beta-blocker
[**Hospital **] for heart rate control, [**Hospital **] ECG remained unchanged,
underlying rhythm being atrial fibrillation. His postoperative
head CT([**4-12**]) is revealed residual small amount of hemorrhage
mixed with fluid, pneumocephalus and postoperative changes. No
further shift of normally midline structures. Repeat head CT on
[**4-13**] remained stable, therefore his right subdural JP removed,
patient tolerated procedure well.
.
Patient will need drain stitch and staples removed on [**4-21**].  If
cant be done at nursing home will need to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**].
 Switched from dilantin to keppra.
.
2. congestive heart failure -
He was worked up for dyspnea and hypoxemia. Final etiology
was clearly congestive heart failure. He had a repeat Echo
which demonstrated preserved EF and some MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was
maintained on a regimen of hydral/nitro, beta blocker,
and cautious diuresis. He was maintained on oxygen by
nasal canula.  Patient sent out on lasix.
.
3. Liver failure/coagulopathy -
He had a self limited course of liver failure with associated
coagulopathy. This was felt to be secondary to dilantin
toxicity.
Dilantin was stopped and his liver enzymes ultimately trended
down
toward normal. Alternative explanation could have been acute
hepatic congestion from heart failure.
.
Re: coagulopathy, he was treated with vitamin K, FFP, and
also
