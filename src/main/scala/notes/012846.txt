AEROBIC BOTTLE (Final [**2119-10-2**]):
      ESCHERICHIA COLI.
         IDENTIFICATION AND SENSITIVITIES PERFORMED ON CULTURE #
[**Numeric Identifier 23696**]
         FROM [**9-28**].
................................................
EKG [**9-29**]:
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial enlargement. Q-T interval
prolongation. ST segment elevation in leads I, aVL and V2-V6.
Delayed precordial R wave progression. Low limb lead voltage.
Findings are consistent with acute anterolateral ischemic
process. No previous tracing available for comparison. Followup
and clinical correlation are suggested.

EKG [**10-2**]:
Sinus rhythm. Compared to the previous tracing voltage has
increased but
remains low. ST segment elevations have reappeared along with a
prolonged
Q-T interval. There is now terminal T wave inversion in leads
V3-V6.
INT: Anterior current of ischemic injury. Rule out non-Q wave
infarction.

EKG [**10-3**]:
Sinus rhythm. Low voltage. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2119-9-29**] voltage has diminished.

NOTE:  THE EKG's FROM [**10-2**] and [**10-3**] WERE RECEIVED BY THE
CARDIOLOGIST FOR [**Location (un) **] AND INCORRECTLY DATED.  THE EKG FROM
[**10-3**] WAS MARKED AS THOUGH IT WERE FROM [**9-29**].  READ THE ABOVE
INTERPRETATIONS WITH CAUTION AND DO NOT READ THEM WITHOUT
LOOKING AT THE ACTUAL EKG's AVAILABLE ON WEB OMR OR IN CCC.
.....................................................

ECHO [**10-3**]:
Conclusions:  EF 50%
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild regional  left ventricular systolic dysfunction with with
distal anterior and apical hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. There is insignificant left ventricular
outflow flow acceleration and  insignificant aortic stenosis.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly  thickened. There is a small pericardial effusion. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of [**2116-5-7**], segmental wall motion abnormality is
new.

CXR [**10-3**]: IMPRESSION: Probable ileus given the extent of small
bowel dilatation.

BRIEF OVERVIEW:
85 YO female with severe dementia admitted for UTI/Urosepsis and
was intubated for airway protection after receiving ativan.  She
was quickly extubated and
