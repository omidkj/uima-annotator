IMAGING:
------------------
CTA Head [**9-26**]:
FINDINGS: Subtle areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage are seen at
the convexity
sulci, unchanged from previous study. No new hemorrhage seen. CT
angiography of the head was obtained using departmental
protocol. Slightly
suboptimal opacification of the vascular structures is seen.
There is no
evidence of an aneurysm, vascular occlusion, or stenosis
identified. 3D
reformatted images appear normal.
IMPRESSION:
Unchanged appearance of subarachnoid hemorrhage at the convexity
sulci. Mild soft tissue swelling in the parietal soft tissues.
CT angiography demonstrate no evidence of vascular occlusion,
stenosis, or an aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size, although the
opacification of the vascular structures is somewhat suboptimal.

Head CT [**9-27**]:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Small foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage
along the
inferior right frontal lobe (2A:11) are not changed. Also there
is possible
tiny hyperdensity along the right superior convexity (2A: 24),
which could
just represent normal [**Doctor Last Name 352**] matter or could represent a tiny
additional focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage; the former is
favored as there is slight streak artifact in this region. High
density along the left parafalcine frontal region has a very
straight linear configuration and could be artifactual or could
represent a tiny additional focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage. No
definite new large intraparenchymal hemorrhage is seen, nor
shift of normally midline structures, effacement of the basal
cisterns, hydrocephalus, or large vascular territorial
infarction. Again note is made of subgaleal hematoma along the
left parietal scalp. Also, there may be non-displaced fracture
along the right frontal bone (2A:27). These are not changed from
prior. The orbits appear unremarkable. Opacification of the
right fronto- ethmoid recess, right anterior ethmoid air cell,
and near complete opacification of the left sphenoid sinus are
as before.
IMPRESSION: Inferior right frontal small foci of subarachnoid
hemorrhage are as before. Possible additional foci of
subarachnoid hemorrhage along the superior convexity bilaterally
are small and could be artifactual. No
definite substantial change.
ATTENDING NOTE: No change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] from OSH after sustaining a
closed head injury after falling from a ladder at home.  He was
admitted to the neurosurgery service for monitoring.  He had
repeated CT scans of the head, which did not reveal any new foci
of hemorrhage, and thereby determined to be stable.  On [**9-28**], he
was seen and evaluated by PT who was able to clear him for home
discharge.  Of note however, he was hypertense to 180(SBP), and
Lisinopril was started. After his blood pressure was adequately
controlled, his was discharged to home on [**9-29**] with appropriate
follow up instructions, and new prescription for lisinopril.
