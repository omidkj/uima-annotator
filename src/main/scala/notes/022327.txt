Imaging:
[**2162-6-9**]: 10.7 x 11.9 x 11.5 cm, well-circumscribed,
heterogeneously-enhancing mass within the right adrenal gland
and
invaginating the inferomedial aspect of the right lobe of the
liver and possibly the caudate lobe of the liver.  Several small
regional mesenteric lymph nodes were also noted in the right
upper quadrant.

[**7-29**] CT Abd/Pelvis: 13.2 X 12.0 X 12.9 heterogenous, well
circumscribed, ? invasion to caudate of liver (no clear border
seen), no involvement of IVC, rest of liver WNL, left adrenal
gland WNL, right kidney is displaced but fills symetrically, LAD
seen, no evidence of mets


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted the day prior to surgery and underwent a CT
angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis that demonstrated slight
enlargement of the adrenal mass to just over 13 cm. There was no
evidence of obvious metastatic disease. Patient .underwent a
radical resection of a large hemorrhagic right adrenocortical
carcinoma on [**7-30**]/9. The operation was accompanied by
extraordinary blood loss which required a massive transfusion of
blood products. At the conclusion of the case, she had diffuse
oozing from multiple sites which was felt to be related to her
hypothermia and coagulopathy.
Accordingly, her right upper quadrant was packed and she was
returned to the intensive care unit with an open abdomen.
Overnight, her temperature normalized and her coagulation
parameters were normalized with blood product. She was brought
back to the OR on [**7-31**]/9 for removal of her packs, and abdominal
closure. After her second operation she went back to the ICU.
Her postoperative course was relatively uneventful in her
recover after her surgeries, being extubated on [**8-3**]/9 and
starting to advance her diet on [**8-4**]/9. She was transfered to
the floor on [**8-4**]/9 and started to ambulate. There was a
question of a right hemiparesia, as she felt weakness on her
right leg and arm, so a Head CT was performed and there was no
evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses or infaction. Clinically
she improved and her weakness resolved. Her foley catheter was
taken out, making adequate amounts or urine, and she started
tolerating regular food. Due to baseline history of chronic
bronchitis, on [**8-6**] her sats were in the high 80s - low 90s, so
she was started on O2 at 1-2lt/min. Today patient was weaned
from the oxygen with PO2 > 95% on room air. Chest X Ray was
ordered and showed no evidence of acute pulmonary process.
Patient will be discharged home with services and PT until for
further return to her baseline activities.
