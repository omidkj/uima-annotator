Brief Hospital Course:
.
# Altered mental status/ETOH intoxication - ETOH and benzos
positive on tox screen. Suspect that altered mental status is
[**12-20**] ETOH intoxication. Positive urine benzo's may be due to
recent benzo's given during recent hospitalization. As patient
at risk for DT's was placed on CIWA scale with Valium/Ativan.
Social work and psychiatry were involved during his admission.
He was also started on thiamine 100mg po, MVI 1 qd, and folic
acid. His mental status improved during his stay. He was not
accepted to any in-patient facilities as was sober and not at
risk from withdrawal at the time of discharge. He was encouraged
to abstain from ETOH use.
.
# Hypotension - patient admitted with intoxication, on hospital
day # 2 became hypotensive with SBP 70-80s. Likely
multifactorial - patient had received Ativan, nadolol and
sublingual nitroglycerin also likely hypotensive from
dehydration. Baseline BP only around SBP 115. Sepsis (secondary
to PNA, SBP, cholangitis) was also considered. He was started
empirically on Zosyn/vanco to cover for possible SBP and PNA
and transferred to the ICU.  He was in the ICU overnight. He was
supported with fluid boluses.  He did not require pressors and
returned to the floor the following day. Blood and urine
cultures were negative. Antibiotics were discontinued.

.
# Abdominal Pain - likely secondary to acute ETOH hepatitis.
Improving since last admission. LFT's and T Bil down from last
admission.  Abdominal imaging - U/S and CT - were both negative.
Abdominal pain had improved on discharge.  He was tolerating po
intake without difficulty.
.
# Chest pain - Had episode of chest pain - L sided chest
pressure radiating to arm. Seems to have a pleuritic component
so pain unlikely to cardiac in nature. BP 112/68, HR 86, T 98.4,
sat 98% 2LNC - EKG done - no acute changes, given sl nitro x 1 -
pain resolved. CE neg x 2.
.
# Cirrhosis - Most likely due to ETOH/HCV/HBV; likely with poor
synthetic liver function (mildly elevated INR, low albumin -
could also be poor nutrition. Continue Nadolol given Grade 3
varices on endoscopy in [**2156-6-17**]. Will need hepatology f/u as an
out-patient.
.
# Pneumonia - ? RLL infiltrate on CXR, had recent admission at
[**Hospital1 2177**] for PNA so this may be resolving. Received Levaquin and
Clinda for possible aspiration in ED. Asymptomatic - no cough,
afebrile, WBC WNL, lungs clear. Antibiotics were discontinued.
.
# Anxiety - Patient has a hisotry of anxiety.  He reported that
Buspar had worked well for his anxiety in the past, so he was
restarted on Buspar during his admission.
