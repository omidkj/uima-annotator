Admission Date:  [**2109-12-18**]     Discharge Date:  [**2110-1-17**]

Date of Birth:   [**2054-4-22**]     Sex:  F

Service:  BMT

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 55-year-old female
with a history of thyroid cancer, status post radioactive
iodine therapy, who presented to her primary care physician
several months ago with a history of easy bruisability.
Workup at that time found her white blood cell count to be
2.8.  The patient was referred to hematology but her
appointment had been postponed.  Over the weekend, she
developed a low grade temperature to 100.0, fever, cough and
production of a green sputum.  She was started on a course of
Levaquin and referred again to a hematologist and had an
expedited bone marrow biopsy on [**2109-12-13**].  On [**2109-12-16**], she
was given the likely diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia
based on those bone marrow biopsy results.

On review of systems, the patient reports no recent easy
bruising.  She has had a good appetite, no dyspnea on
exertion, no shortness of breath, no headache, no fevers, no
upper respiratory infection symptoms, no gastrointestinal
complaints, no nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, constipation,
no bone pain, no joint pain, no pruritus, no vision changes,
no hearing changes, no sinus problems.  She does use CPAP for
obstructive sleep apnea secondary to vocal cord paralysis,
but has stopped ten days ago because of concern about
infection.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Thyroid cancer.  She received iodine 121 in the past.
2.  Obstructive sleep apnea secondary to vocal cord

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a 55-year-old female with newly
diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia, who presents for
induction chemotherapy.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Hematology/oncology - The patient presented with newly
diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia by bone marrow biopsy
done prior to admission.  The patient was initiated on
induction chemotherapy including Idarubicin and ARA-C,
Idarubicin for three days and ARA-C for seven days.  She
presented with neutropenia and was maintained on neutropenic
precautions for the entirety of her hospital stay.  She was
anemic on admission and became thrombocytopenic shortly after
the initiation of chemotherapy and required multiple
transfusions throughout her hospital stay to address both her
anemia and thrombocytopenia.  In total, she required nine
units of packed red blood cells transfusion throughout her
hospital stay and a total of ten bags of platelets for
ongoing issues of thrombocytopenia, which did become
refractory to transfusion later in her hospital course.  The
patient tolerated induction chemotherapy well but
subsequently developed febrile neutropenia and had a
complicated course beyond that including extensive infectious
disease workup with aggressive antibiotic coverage and
subsequent development of respiratory failure in conjunction
with high fevers and possible transfusion reaction resulting
in capillary leak requiring Medical Intensive Care Unit stay
for diuresis.  Transfusion medicine attending was consulted
in regard to this respiratory failure to consider the
possibility of transfusion related acute lung injury, which
this patient had some features of but did not fully meet
criteria for this disorder.  Shortly after the initiation of
chemotherapy, the patient was monitored closely for
tumor-lysis syndrome and was continued on Allopurinol for
expected hyperuricemia, normal cytogenetics were noted on her
initial bone marrow biopsy.  Subsequent day fourteen bone
marrow biopsy showed no evidence of leukemia suggesting
successful induction therapy.  During the [**Hospital 228**] hospital
course, she received multiple transfusions to address her
anemia and thrombocytopenia as mentioned above.  On [**2110-1-6**],
she was noted to have direct antibody test positivity.
Transfusions were held at this time for this reason and due
to the patient's dramatic fevers to 105 degrees.  On
[**2110-1-8**], the patient was initiated on Neupogen to address
her ongoing neutropenia.  On [**2110-1-17**], bone marrow biopsy was
done by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 410**] to assess the patient's response to
chemotherapy course.  The pathology results did show no
evidence of leukemia.

2.  Infectious disease - The patient remained neutropenic
throughout her hospital stay.  She was initially continued on
a course of Levofloxacin for prophylaxis.  She remained
afebrile until [**2109-12-29**], when she spiked a fever and was
pancultured.  Cefepime and Vancomycin were added to her
regimen at that time.  As fevers did recur, she was started
on AmBisome for antifungal coverage.  On [**2110-1-3**], she
continued to spike fevers, but had no localizing symptoms.
On [**2110-1-4**], fevers to 103 persisted and Cefepime was changed
to Aztreonam for broad coverage.  Her fevers markedly
increased despite change in medication and her Aztreanam was
changed to Meropenem for gram positive gram negative
anaerobic coverage in addition to Vancomycin and AmBisome. On
[**2110-1-6**], she spiked fevers to 105 degrees.  A CAT scan of
the chest done on that day did reveal a right lower lobe
consolidation consistent with pneumonia.  Infectious disease
consultation was obtained at that time in addition to sputum
cultures.  Recommendations for viral antigen testing were
made.  In addition to their initial recommendation for CT of
the torso, they recommended altering her antibiotic course to
include Vancomycin, Aztreonam and Flagyl.  The patient has
slow improvement of her fever curve during her Intensive Care
Unit stay and subsequent stay on the floor.  She did have
persistent diarrhea and was suspected to be Clostridium
difficile positive, however, this was not supported by stool
studies.  However, the patient was continued on p.o. Flagyl
during her hospital course and discharged on a course of
Vancomycin to address this likely possibility.  All cultures
during the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay were unrevealing of a
bacterial infectious cause to her fevers.
