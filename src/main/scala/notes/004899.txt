Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis line placement
Exploratory laparotomy [**2169-8-18**]
Removal of peritoneal dialysis catheter [**2169-8-18**]


History of Present Illness:
51yo M with h/o DM1 on insulin pump, ESRD s/p failed renal
transplant now on PD presented to the ED with 2 days of
abdominal "aches" and 1 day of cloudy peritoneal fluid. Patient
has had previous episodes of peritonitis and had similar
abdominal pain with those episodes. In addition he has had 10X
water stools daily for 2 days, mucousy but not bloody. The
patient does make urine but has not had dysuria. He denies
rhinorrhea, cough, SOB, chest pain, and palpitations. He has had
poor PO intake over the last 2 days but no nausea or vomiting.
.
In the ED, initial vs were T:97.2 HR:79 BP:122/65 RR:14
O2sat:100% on room air. Patient was given CTX and vancomycin for
leukocytosis to 17 and peritoneal fluid and stool cultures were
sent. He complained of abdominal pain that radiated to the left
arm so an EKG was done that showed tachycardia (sinus) with
lateral ST depressions. Cardiac enzymes revealed a troponin of
0.72 (baseline 0.5). Cardiology was called and felt this was
rate-related demand and not acute coronary syndrome. The patient
refused aspirin but because of some hypertension on the floor
did receive and extra 12.5mg of metoprolol.
.
Despite the poor PO intake the patient had been having high
sugars at home. He was on his insulin pump at 0.9 units of
novolog and had also given himself 9 units extra of novolog at
home for FSBS in the 400s. Repeat FSBS on the floor were
persistently in the 400s. The team called [**Last Name (un) 387**] who follows him
as an outpatient. They recommended insulin gtt given that the
patient's initial chem 7 had a FSBS of close to 500 and a new
anion gap (17 with bicarb 19 from baseline 28). For this reason
he is transferred to the ICU.
.
Prior to transfer to the ICU the team spoke with the renal staff
who felt that the patient should receive CTZ rather than CTX for
the peritonitis and thought he could receive around 500mL of
fluids overnight but were hesitant to allow him to get more
because of his dependence on PD and the fact that he would not
be getting PD overnight given the infection.
.
On arrival to the ICU, patient was sleepy, having just received
morphine.  He denied pain.  Denied recent chest
pain/pressure/dyspnea.  No recent headaches, no f/c.  Endorsed
above history.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion.
Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing. Denies chest
pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness. Denies nausea,
vomiting, constipation. Denies dysuria, frequency, or urgency.
.

ADMISSION CXR:
FINDINGS:
Lung volumes are low. Right hemidiaphragm is elevated. Right
cardiac border is obscured by opacity, which may represent
atelectasis or pneumonia, if clinically appropriate. No pleural
effusions are seen. Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are
stable. Mild cardiomegaly is noted, unchanged. No pneumothorax
is present. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is seen. Patient
is status post median sternotomy. Sternotomy wires appear
intact. Bony structures appear unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Right middle lobe opacity, likely atelectasis or pneumonia,
if clinically appropriate.
2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion.

ABDOMEN, SUPINE AND UPRIGHT: A catheter overlies the right mid
abdomen, compatible with a peritoneal dialysis catheter, and is
unchanged in appearance from prior study. There is a relative
paucity of bowel gas throughout, suggestive of fluid filled
small and large bowel loops, compatible with provided history of
watery stools. The stomach is visualized, and is not distended.
There is no free air or pneumatosis.
IMPRESSION: Relative paucity of bowel gas throughout, suggestive
of fluid filled small and large bowel loops, in keeping with
provided history of  watery stools. Bowel distension is
difficult to assess given the lack of  bowel gas.

[**2169-8-21**] MRI HEAD:
Acute infarcts involving the body of the corpus callosum,
cingulate gyrus, right occipital lobe, pons and left middle
cerebellar
peduncle. The involvement of multiple vascular territories
suggest emboli
from a central source in the appropriate clinical setting.

[**2169-8-21**] TTE:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast at rest. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild global
hypokinesis without regional dysfunction (LVEF 45%). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No discrete vegetation or mass is seen. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No discrete vegetation or mass is seen. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Low normal biventricular systolic fuctio
