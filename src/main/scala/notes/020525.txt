IMAGING
[**2150-4-3**] FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:
There are new right mid and upper zone opacities since [**1-14**], [**2149**],
concerning for infection. Again seen is severe left hemithorax
volume loss secondary to prior left lobectomy, with unchanged
associated leftward mediastinal shift. There is decreased
aeration of the left lung apex as compared to the prior study.
There is no right pleural effusion or right pneumothorax. Severe
osteopenia and multiple severe wedge compression deformities
throughout the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine are again
seen.

IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal pneumonia.
2. Chronic left lobectomy volume loss with leftward mediastinal
shift, and interval mild decrease in aeration of the left lung
apex.


Brief Hospital Course:
REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
67F with hx RA, HTN, asthma and recurrent severe PNA p/w
dyspnea, found to have multifocal PNA.

ACUTE:
# PNA: On admission pt had evidence of multifocal PNA with
involvement of RML and RUL. Poor pulmonary reserve noted, with
hx left lower lobectomy during complicated pneumonia in the
past. Initially required several L supplemental O2 in the ED but
was weaned to 2L prior to floor transfer, and further weaned to
RA overnight (within 12h). She was started empirically on
vanc/levo in the ED. Also received duonebs and IV
methylprednisolone with improvement in dyspnea. Given history of
severe PNA, the ED elected to admit the patient to the MICU for
closer monitoring. She received 1 dose aztreonam in the ICU
because of hospital policy of double coverage for pseudomonal
PNA in pts requiring ICU admission and pt's documented allergy
to cephalosporin (Aztreonam not continued thereafter).
Legionella antigen negative.  Given her clinical appearance &
CXR findings, she was not felt to have an MRSA PNA.  Pt was
eventually transitioned from vancomycin & IV levofloxacin to PO
moxifloxacin, which she will continue to complete a 14-day
course.

CHRONIC:
# Asthma:  Patient is on combivent at home. Not on inhaled
steroid at home, but did receive 125mg IV solumedrol in ED.  No
additional steroids administered given clinical stability.
Nebulizers were continued on the floor and the patient was
discharged on her home inhalers.

# Hypertension: The patient was normotensive on admission. Home
verapamil was continued.

# Anxiety:   Continued home regimen of amitryptiline and
klonopin.

# Migraines: Continued home regimen of amitriptyline.
