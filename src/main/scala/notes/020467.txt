Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
persistant AFIB, RCA disease on cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
CABG x2, MAZE, LAA ligation


History of Present Illness:
The patient is 56-year-old gentleman who was
initially sent to me for minimally invasive Maze procedure
for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient had longer
and longer episodes of atrial fibrillation and now
constitutes persistent atrial fibrillation. One time he was
admitted for his minimally invasive Maze procedure and a left
atrial clot was noted in his left atrial appendage and he
underwent anticoagulation for that with subsequent resolution
of his left atrial thrombus. The last time he was admitted to
hospital for the minimally invasive Maze procedure, a
diagnostic cardiac cath was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 401**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1295**] due
to some atherosclerosis which was noted on the preoperative
CT angiogram to evaluate his left atrium. The diagnostic
cardiac cath revealed anomalous right coronary artery with a
significant lesion within the mid to proximal segment as well
as a subtotally occluded first obtuse marginal coronary
artery. The decision was therefore made to proceed with
concomitant Maze on top of a coronary artery bypass grafting
procedure. The patient therefore agreed to proceed

Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Overall normal LVEF
(>55%). No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity.

AORTA: Moderately dilated aortic sinus.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Trivial
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
No PS.

PERICARDIUM: Small to moderate pericardial effusion. Sgnificant,
accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve
inflows, c/w impaired ventricular filling.
Conclusions
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is dilated The aortic root is moderately
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a small to moderate sized
pericardial effusion. There is significant, accentuated
respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows,
consistent with impaired ventricular filling. The effusion is
partially echodense consistent with some degree of organization.
