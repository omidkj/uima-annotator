Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2190-7-9**] - Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting x4 with left
internal mammary artery grafted to the left anterior descending,
reverse saphenous vein graft to the marginal branch, diagonal
branch and the posterior descending artery.
[**2190-7-6**] - Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **]. [**Known lastname **] is a -52-year-old female with hepatitis C and
child A cirrhosis who was known to have peripheral vascular
disease and underwent cardiac
catheterization for anginal symptoms that showed severe 3-vessel
disease, presenting for coronary revascularization. I decided to
perform the operation off-pump on a beating heart given early
cirrhosis to try and avoid causing further liver decompensation
from cardiopulmonary bypass.

[**2190-7-6**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated three (3) vessel coronary artery disease.
Specifically the
left main was calcified with no flow limiting lesions.  The left

anterior descending artery was diffusely diseased with a long
complex
90% lesion in the proximal portion of the vessel that extended
into the
first diagaonal.  The left circumflex was a small caliber vessel
with a
90% lesion in the obtuse marginal.  The right coronary artery
was also a
small caliber vessel with diffuse disease throughtout the
vessel.
2. LV ventriculography demonstrated a preserved left ventricular

function with an ejection fraction of approximately 65%.  The
mitral
valve did not demonstrate any evidence of any valvular
regurgitation.
There was no significant pressure gradient across the aortic
valve upon
pullback from the left ventricle to the aorta.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderate systemic
hypertension.

[**2190-7-9**] ECHO:
PREGRAFTING
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Thjere is mild to moderate TR.

POSTGRAFTING
Preserved biventricular systolic function. Study unchanged from
baseline.

[**2190-7-8**] Ultrasound
Mild heterogeneity within the liver. No ascites. No additional
pathology seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **]. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2190-7-6**] for further
evaluation of her chest pain. She underwent a cardiac
catheterization which revealed three vessel disease. Given the
severity of her disease, the cardiac surgical servive was
consulted for surgical evaluation. She was worked-up in the
usual preoperative manner. The hepatology service was consulted
for evaluation of surgical risk given her hepatitis. She was
classified as a Child's score A cirrhotic and cleared for
surgery. The hematology service was consulted given her
leukocytopenia however it was felt that this was mild,
longstanding and related to her hepatitis. On [**2190-7-9**], Ms. [**Known lastname **].
[**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where she underwent off
pump coronary artery bypass grafting to four vessels. Please see
operative note for details. Postoperatively she was taken to the
CSRU for monitoring. She latera awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated. On postoperative day one, Ms. [**Known lastname **]. [**Known lastname **] was
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. She was
gently diuresed towards her preoperative weight. The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with her
postoperative strength and mobility.  She has remained
hemodynamically stable and is now ready for discharge.
