Chief Complaint:
Bradycardia, asystole

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Aborted Internal Cardiac Defibrillator placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 43417**] is a 65 year old gentleman with hisotry of
hyperlipidemia, single vessel CAD s/p PCI to LAD [**10-3**], and
systolic heart failure, presenting for elective ICD placement.
Briefly, Mr [**Name13 (STitle) 84476**] was intially found to have ectopy during
a colonoscopy, prompting a cardiac workup. Initially, ECHO
revealed EF of 45% however when repeated in [**Month (only) **] it showed
an LVEF of 25-30%. A holter monitor revealed very frequent PVC's
(23,000 PVCs 23% of beats) and 3-4 beats of NSVT. Patient
subsequently presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital with an episode of
chest pain. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**2138-9-26**], which revealed a 90% mid LAD lesion
and he had a 3.5 x 13mm Cypher stent.

A repeat holter monitor was done after cath and medical thereapy
and again revealed frequent PVC's (13.5% of total beats).
Patient tolerated 6 minutes in [**Doctor First Name **] protocol, which reveald
frequent
unifocal ventricular ectopy at rest becoming multifocal
including multifocal ventricular couplets and short runs of AIVR
non-sustained VT during exercise.

Given progression systolic dysfunction and lack of identifiable
targets of revascularization, patient was referred for ICD
placement given NYHA Class II symptoms and EF of 35% (per
SCDHeft).

Today, during initiation of procedure and after chest pocket
incision, patient became progressively bradycardic and
eventually asystolic for at least one minute. Per report patient
underwent chest compressions, was intubated, did not receive
atropine and instead received a temporary venous pacer via the
right femoral vein. Patient was started on peripheral Dopamine
and Neosynephrine and procedure was aborted. He is transferred
to CCU for futher management.

EKG: [**2138-11-27**] Sinus bradycardia with ventricular premature beats.
Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay.

CXR: [**2138-11-26**] There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Left lower
lobe opacity could be atelectasis or aspiration. ET tube tip is
4 cm above the carina. There is mild cardiomegaly. There are no
pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 year old man with history of hyperlipidemia, CAD, systolic
heart failure, initially admitted for ICD placement for ejection
fraction of 35% on ECHO [**2138-9-27**].  Implantation aborted after
episode of bradycardia and asystole with respiratory arrest
during procedure requiring intubation.

1. BRADYCARDIA: Episode of bradycardia during aborted ICD
implantation, most likely induced by a profound vasovagal
response. Initially, patient was placed on dopamine and a
temporary venous pacemaker was set at 35 bpm.  Pressors were
weaned quickly and patient heart rate remained within acceptable
range.  Remained hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic.
Patient was monitored on continous telemetry with no evidence of
conduction disease.  Home dose of B-blocker was initially held,
but this was restarted prior to discharge as has multpile
indications for therapy including frequent PVCs and heart
failure.

2. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Stable, single vessel disease in LAD
s/p PCI in [**2138-9-26**].  Asymptomatic with no complaints of angina.
Continued on aspirin, plavix, statin.  As above B- blocker
initally held, but restarted prior to discharge.

3. CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Likely combination of
ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Patient stable on
medical management with ACE-I, b-blocker and ASA.  Received
vancomycin for antibiotic prophylaxis pre- and post- procedure.
Patient declined repeat attempt at ICD implantation during
hospital course.  He will have close follow up with outpatient
cardiologist and repeat ECHO in 3 months to reassess ejection
fraction after revascularization.

4. RESPIRATORY ARREST: Secondary to circulatory arrest
(bradycardic), no intrinsic pulmonary process to cause
respiratory distress.  Patient extubated quickly following
discontinuation of sedation.  Respiratory status remained stable
through duration of hospital stay.

5. HYPERLIPIDEMIA:  stable, on statin

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for a internal defibrillator placement. During
the procedure, you had a vagal episode which resulted in a low
blood pressure and heart rate. You required a breathing tube and
some medicine to keep your blood pressure up. The defibrillator
was not placed, you will need to talk to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23246**] about
whether this will be placed in the future.
Medication changes:
1. Decrease the Metopolol XLto 25 mg twice daily
.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days. You should get an
echocardiogram in 3 months.
