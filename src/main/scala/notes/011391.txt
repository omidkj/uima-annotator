Physical Exam:
Vitals: 97.4 152/90 84 20 95%RA

HEENT: PERRL
Neck: supple
CV: RRR, no murmur appreciated
Lungs: decreased breath sounds on right
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND
Ext: feet wrapped, amputation of 3rd toe; new ulcer on 4th toe


Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
[**2109-5-20**] CXR -
1. Large right pleural effusion with confluent right lower lobe
opacity may indicate volume loss; however, an embedded focus of
pneumonia cannot be excluded.
2. Mild volume overload.

[**2109-5-21**] CXR - In comparison with the study of [**5-20**], there is
again a substantial right pleural effusion with area of
opacification at the right base. This may reflect underlying
atelectasis, though the possibility of acute pneumonia can
certainly not be excluded.
Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, though the
pulmonary vessels are less prominent. This raises the
possibility of underlying cardiomyopathy or pericardial
effusion. The left lung is relatively clear with only minimal
atelectatic change.

[**2109-5-21**] ECHO - IMPRESSION: Mild global biventricular systolic
dysfunction. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe
tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Moderately dilated aorta.  Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2107-7-26**], biventricular systolic dysfunction and
valvular abnormalities are new.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is an 87 yo F w/ alzheimers, atrial tachycardia,
HTN, anemia (jehovah's witness, no bld product xfusions) p/w
cough and respiratory distress since 1 day, decreased POx1wk.

SOB/cough/Pleural Effusion:  The patient was found to have new
right pleural effusion.  It was unclear if there was also a
retrocardiac opacity.  She was originally treated in the ICU
with vanco/zosyn but was quickly switched to levofloxacin.  She
completed a 5 day course.  An ECHO showed slightly worsening
cardiac function since a prior study.  We diuresed the patient
and her symptoms improved.  Given the families decision to bring
the patient home with hospice a thoracentesis was not pursued at
this time.

UTI:  The patient had a UTI and was treated with a course of
levofloxacin.  Cultures eventually grew resistent proteus and
the patient was switched to ceftriaxone and completed a 3 day
course prior to discharge.

Tachycardia: The patient has a history of a fib/flutter and
atrial tachycardia.  She has been followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in
the past.  It is felt that at this time she is not a surgical
candidate for a pacemaker and given her familys desire to move
towards hospice, this was not pursued.

Hypothyroid:  She was continued on her home levothyroxine.

H/o PE: The patient has a h/o of PE diagnosed in [**8-15**].  She was
maintained on coumadin while in house.  It was held for several
days because of a supratherapeutic INR but restarted when her
INR was <3.

Foot Ulcers: The patient is followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3407**] outpatient.
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 3407**] saw the patient while she was hospitalized and feels
that she is no longer a surgical candidate.  She should continue
wound care and medical management of her ulcers.

Code Status: Confirmed DNR/DNI with family.  Multipel family
meetings with the family and palliative regarding hospice.  The
family decided to take the patient home with hospice.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath.  We
feel like this was likely because of some fluid in your right
lung and possibly a pneumonia.  We are treating you with 5 days
of levofloxacin to treat a pneumonia.  This will finish on the
day your leave the hospital so you will not need to take this at
home.

You were also treated for a urinary tract infection.  We treated
you with 3 days of an IV antibiotic called ceftriaxone.

After discussion with you and your family a decision was made to
send you home under hospice care.  The hospice providers as well
as Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] will continue to care for you at your home.

No changes were made to your home medications while you were
here.

Followup Instructions:
Please follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] this week.  Her office number is
