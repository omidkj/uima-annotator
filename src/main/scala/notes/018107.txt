Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3376**]
Chief Complaint:
Lower Gastrointestinal Bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p R colectomy [**6-28**]


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 86 year-old male with a h/o of a sigmoid
colectomy for 4-5cm bleeding rectosigmoid mass at 15 cm
transferred from [**Hospital **] Hospital after presenting with a lower
gastrointestinal bleed requiring a total of 13 units of PRBC
over the course of 8 days.  His last transfusion occurred at
2:55AM on
[**2154-6-24**] with his last hemotocrit of 28.5 at 9AM.

Per the patient, he reports that his prior episode of
gastrointestinal bleed occurred approxiamtely 10 years prior to
presentation which required the sigmoid colectomy and does not
remember any other episodes of BRBPR.  He states that on [**6-16**], [**2153**], he had diffuse abdominal cramps and pain sometime in
the next morning had a large bloody bowel movement.  He
immediately went to [**Hospital **] Hospital.  At [**Hospital **] Hospital, he
has had multiple tagged RBC scans which were all negative
([**2154-6-16**], [**2154-6-18**] and [**2154-6-20**]) until one on [**2154-6-22**] which
reportedly showed a small accumulation of radiolabel in the
right
midabdomen, possibly a right colonic gastrointestinal bleeding
source.  He also underwent colonoscopy X 2 which showed diffuse
colonic diverticulosis from the proximal ascending to the
rectosigmoid anastomosis at 15cm with relative sparing of the
splenic flexure.  Upper endoscopy revealed normal stomach and
duodenum.  Following his positive tagged RBC scan, the decision
for possible angiography or conservative management was decided
and the decision to transfer to a facility with angiography
capabilities was made.

Currently he reports no pain and no bloody bowel movement for
the
previous three days.

Capsule Endoscopy Report [**6-26**]
Summary: 1. dark fluid in the small bowel precludes complete

limit
of the examination


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further angiographic vs.
surgical management. On transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU, patient was
hemodynamically stable. Patient was evaluated by surgery team

The patient reports feeling very well. He reports that prior to
recent bleeding episode he had not had BRBPR in nearly 10 years.

diet advanced to clear liquids, transferred to the surgical
floor for continued monitoring.

[**6-26**] - transfused one unit RBC for low hematocrit, capusle study
was performed demonstrating  dark fluid in the small bowel and
no active bleeding seen in the small bowel to the limit of the
examination.  Temp spike, pan cultured with positive urine
cultures, started on cipro.

[**6-28**] - the patient was taken to the operating room for a right
colectomy, he tolerated the procedure well, diet NPO, IVF for
hydration, IV pain control, foley catheter in place.

[**6-29**] - diet advanced to sips, maint IVF

[**6-30**] - diet advanced to clears, foley catheter removed, patient
