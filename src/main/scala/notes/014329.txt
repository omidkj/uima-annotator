CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Tachypnea and acute respiratory failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
female with a history of COPD and asthma, found by EMS
tachypneic and lethargic after patient pressed her life-line
activation of EMS.  She was brought to [**Hospital6 649**] E.D. where she was found to be hypercarbic and
acidemic and was intubated for respiratory distress.  She was
admitted to the ICU for management of respiratory failure and
also found to be in acute and chronic renal failure with some
component of congestive heart failure.  She was extubated on
the second hospital day and was also found to be in metabolic
acidosis, thought to be secondary to renal failure.  She
tolerated extubation quite well in the ICU and had started
treatment with I.V. steroids.  Her medical status improved
and she was to be transferred to the floor.  Per family, the
patient was feeling weaker and more fatigued over the past
week and a home health aide found her to be more confused and
lethargic on the day prior to admission to the hospital.

EXAM UPON PRESENTATION:  Temperature 98.1??????, blood pressure
170/92, pulse 86, respirations 26, and 96% on 2 liters.  In
general, the patient is an elderly female lying in bed in no
apparent distress.  HEENT reveals moist mucous membranes,
nasal cannula in place.  Lungs were fairly clear to
auscultation with minimal crackles and wheezes.
Cardiovascular was regular rate and rhythm without murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  The abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, with positive bowel sounds.  The extremities
showed 1+ edema bilaterally.  The neurological exam revealed
cranial nerves that were intact.  Speech was fluent and
comprehensible by relatives who understood [**Name (NI) 595**].

LABS UPON PRESENTATION:  White count of 10.3, hematocrit of
35.5, platelets 220, sodium 145, potassium 5.2, chloride 114,
bicarb 22, BUN 52, creatinine 2.2, magnesium 1.9.  These labs
were upon admission to the floor.

RADIOLOGICAL DATA:  Lower extremity non-invasive was negative
for deep venous thrombosis.  Chest x-ray done many times
showed congestive heart failure with minimal bilateral
pleural effusions and bilateral bibasilar atelectasis versus
infiltrate.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1.  SHORTNESS OF BREATH:  This was thought to be attributable
to both the CHF exacerbation and the COPD exacerbation.  She
was also thought to have questionable infiltrate, thus she
was started on Levofloxacin.  For the CHF exacerbation, she
was placed on furosemide with diuresis and kept on strict
I&Os.  For COPD exacerbation, she was kept on prednisone 60
mg orally after two days of I.V. Solu-Medrol and appeared to
do well.  She continued to have nebulizer treatments and her
O2 sats were satisfactory upon room air.

2.  CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  The patient's baseline creatinine
was approximately anywhere from 2.1 to 2.6.  The patient's
creatinine did increase with diuresis, however did resolve by
the time of discharge somewhat.

3.  HYPERTENSION:  The patient's blood pressure was well
controlled on a Lopressor dose of 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To pulmonary rehab.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
