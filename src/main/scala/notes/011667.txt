DOE.  Last cath in [**2104**] showed mid RCA occlusion, 40% distal LM
lesion, 50% ostial cx, and 50% mid LAD.  Cath [**12-16**] showed 60-70%
distal left main disease, mid LAD disease and R occluded.  He is
being admitted for csurg eval for 3 vessel disease and for AVR.
+ chronic mild LE edema, but no chest pain, orthopnea, nausea.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
[**2105-12-16**] Cath: 1. Left main and two vessel coronary artery
disease. 2. Elevated biventricular filling pressures. 3. Severe
aortic stenosis. 4. Large infrarenal aortic aneurysm with
compression of inferior vena cava.

[**2105-12-16**] Chest CT: 1. Aortic arch and descending thoracic aortic
atherosclerotic calcification, which spares the proximal 6 cm of
the ascending aorta. 2. Severe aortic valvular calcification. 3.
Incidental finding of possible abdominal aortic enlargement, not
fully evaluated by the thoracic CT, abdominal aorta ultrasound
would be an appropriate first step in its evaluation. 4. Diffuse
idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis of the thoracic spine. Fusion
of the posterior elements on posterior longitudinal ligament of
thoracic spine also raises the possibility of ankylosing
spondylitis. 5. Probable pulmonary arterial hypertension.

[**2105-12-17**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA 40-59% stenosis. Left ICA/bulb
60-69% stenosis.

[**2105-12-22**] Echo: PRE-CPB: There are three aortic valve leaflets.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to
moderate ([**1-10**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. The mitral valve leaflets do
not fully coapt. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
of the basal and mid-papillary inferior, inferoseptal and
inferolateral segments. These wall segments also appear thinned.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 35-40 %). No thrombus is seen in the left
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the distal aortic
arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. POST-CPB: A porcine bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis
is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears to be well
seated and the leaflets appear to move normally. There is no
apparent paravalvular leak. The peak gradient across the aortic
valve is 15mmHg, the mean gradient is 9mmHg with a CO of 5.5.
The LV systolic function appears unchanged from pre-op. The
regional wall motion abnormalities are in the same distribution
as pre-op, affecting the inferior, inferoseptal, and
inferolateral walls. Estimated EF 35-40%. There is moderate MR,
unchanged from pre-op. RV systolic function remains normal. The
protruding atheroma in the distal arch remains unchanged. There
is no evidence of dissection.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 73 year old male with
known aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease with recent
admission at outside hospital for congestive heart failure. Echo
there showed severe AS. He presented today with the same
complaints for a cardiac cath to further evaluate AS/CAD. Cath
revealed left main, two vessel coronary artery disease, and
severe aortic stenosis. Following cath he was admitted for
medical management and cardiac surgery work-up. Which included
chest CT, carotid U/S, echo, and dental clearance in addition to
the usual lab work. He also received Plavix at time of cath and
therefore surgery was delayed until Plavix washout. In addition,
upon dental exam, he required multiple teeth to be extracted.
This was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
