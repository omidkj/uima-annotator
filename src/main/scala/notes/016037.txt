Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides) / Iodine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain, syncope

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with stent placement
temporary pacing wire placement
Pulmonary artery catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
70yo M with h/o cAD s/p multiple PCIs, DM2, HTN, hyperlipidemia,
who was reportedly witnessed to have a syncopal episode outside
of a convenience store.  Per report, he had LOC x ~30 seconds.
EMS called, pt c/o chest pain.  On EMS exam, pt was diaphoretic,
pale, HR 30s--> 50s after atropine.  He was brought to [**Hospital 6451**], ECG revealed inferior STE with reciprocal ST
depressions concerning for ACS.  He was given a total of 600mg
Plavix, 2L NS, heparin gtt, integrilin drip, morphine 1mg, SL
NTG x 1.  His BP was initially 125/108 but then dropped to 79/52
(?after SL NTG), so he was started on dopamine.  He was also
found to have SA node arrest with junctional excape rhythm at
~35bpm despite atropine x 3.  He was started on transcutaneous
pacing and transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] cath lab.
.
Upon arrival to the cath lab at 11:45am, he had SBP 110s on
10mcg/hr of dopamine, externally paced with underlying rhythm
narrow complex at 40bpm on tele.  Cath revealed diffuse RCA
disease, s/p bare metal stents (no DES [**1-25**] tortuosity).  Bedside
echo with grossly preserved LV function and no pericardial
effusion.
.
He has been chest pain-free since leaving the cath lab.  He
reports some difficulty breathing.  Denies lightheadedness, N/V,
abdominal pain, palpitations.  He states the chest pain he
experienced with his syncopal episode was identical to his
symptoms prior to his MI in [**2079**], as well as prior to his past
caths.  He also gives a history of having LE weakness and
lightheadedness after standing up on several occasions over the
past couple of years.  His wife reports he has been very busy
during tax season and has been fatigued over the last couple of
weeks.

Past Medical History:
1. CAD: s/p PCI to LAD, last cath [**2096**]
2. DM2: followed at [**Last Name (un) **], poor diet compliance per wife, last
[**Name (NI) 107872**] 10.0 ([**5-28**])
3. HTN
4. Hyperlipidemia: in [**5-28**]- Tchol 213, TG 345, HDL 36, LDL 122
5. CKD: baseline creatinine 1.3-1.7
6. OSA: on CPAP (unknown settings- [**11-30**] or 13/9 per [**2100**] sleep
study) at home

Social History:
married, lives with wife, tax accountant (currently very busy
with tax season), quit EtOH, remote h/o tobacco use in college
only, no drug use

Family History:
noncontributory

Physical Exam:
vitals- T 94.3, BP 116/67 (MAP 79), HR 80- Vpaced, RR 16, O2sat
100% NRB
General- obese man lying flat in bed,
HEENT- sclerae anicteric, moist MM, NGT
Neck- supple, JVD difficult to assess [**1-25**] body habitus, no
carotid bruits
Lungs- scattered high-pitched expiratory wheeze b/l, no
prolonged expiratory phase, no rales
Heart- distant heart sounds, RRR, normal S1/S2, no audible
murmur
Abd- distended but soft, high-pitched bowel sounds in bilateral
upper quadrants and decreased BS in b/l lower quadrants, NT
Ext- no LE edema, DP pulses faint b/l
Neuro- somnolent but easily arousable, Ox3, CNs grossly intact

Pertinent Results:
REPORTS:
.
ECG at OSH: narrow QRS at 35bpm, likely junctional escape
rhythm, no definite p-wave conduction, 1mm STE III/F, 1mm STD
I/L, 1mm STE V1, 1mm STD V2
.
Cardiac cath [**2103-4-7**] (Received solumedrol, H2 blocker, H1
blocker pre-cath for iodine allergy):
COMMENTS:
 1. Coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system. The
LMCA
showed a discrete 50% distal stenosis which did not
angiographically
appear to be flow-limiting. The LAD demonstrated a 50% stenosis
at its
origin as well as a 40% instent restenosis in the proximal
segment. The
LCX showed a 50% stenosis at the origin and a discrete 80%
midsegment
stenosis distal to a large OM branch. The RCA demonstrated
diffuse
disease with a 90% stenosis at the origin and diffuse 80%
stenoses
throughout the proximal and midsegment.
 2. Hemodynamic studies demonstrated a moderately low cardiac
index of
2.0 L/min/m2 with severely elevated PCWP of 38mmHg, suggestive
of severe
LV diastolic dysfunction.  Moderate pulmonary hypertension with
PA
pressures of 50/25 were noted.
 3. Successful PTCA/stenting of the RCA with overlapping
minivision
baremetal stents (2.5x18mm x 4 and one 3.0x18mm) with great
results (see
PTCA comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute inferoposterior MI with high degree AV block.
3. PCI of the RCA.
.
TTE [**2103-4-7**]:
Conclusions:
1. Gross RV hypokinesis.
2. Grossly preserved LV function on limited views (probably
hyperdynamic)
3. No significant pericardial effusion.
4. Mitral regurgiation cannot be excluded, but less than severe
if present.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2103-4-9**] 11:02 AM
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
lesions. Degenerative changes are seen within the visualized
thoracolumbar spine.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for retroperitoneal or other hematoma.
2. Small calcification in the neck of the gallbladder consistent
with cholelithiasis. No evidence for cholecystitis.
3. Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
.
TTE [**2103-4-9**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Preserved left ventricular systolic function. Mild
mitral
regurgitation.
.
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2103-4-11**] 3:29 PM
IMPRESSION: Essentially normal. Resolution CHF.
.
DUPLEX DOP ABD/PEL LIMITED  [**2103-4-11**] 2:05 PM
IMPRESSION: Mildly elevated bilateral resistive indices. No
definite evidence of renal artery stenosis.
.
FEMORAL VASCULAR US BILAT  [**2103-4-11**] 2:06 PM
FINDINGS: Directed son[**Name (NI) 493**] examination of the right common
femoral vein was performed. Doppler examination demonstrates
normal waveforms with respiration, Valsalva, and augmentation.
No evidence for femoral or upstream thrombus is identified.
