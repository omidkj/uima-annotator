History of Present Illness:
60 yo M PMH Kidney t/p [**2192**], pancreas t/p [**2193**], CAD s/p RCA
stent [**2192**] who presents with gi bleeding. The pt was in his
usual
state of health until the morning before admission when he
became
nauseas and began to vomit, and then had loose BM. Shortly after
the bowel movement he felt weak, laid down, and 911 was called.
While on the floor he had a large volume bloody stool. Per his
wife, he had not complained of fevers, chills, abdominal pain or
any other symptoms prior to this sequence of events. He has no
prior history of either upper or lower GI bleeding.

He was initially transported to the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] ED and noted to
have BRBPR. He wouldn't tolerate NG lavage. SBP initially 105
and
went to 140's with fluid bolus. He received 1 unit of irradiated
PRBCs. On ECG at [**Location (un) 620**] noted to have anterior lateral ST
depressions that improved after transfusion.

He was admitted to the MICU and went to IR for angiography. He
had appeared to stop bleeding approximately 40 minutes prior to
angiography and no bleeding was discovered at the time of the
procedure. He was brought back to the MICU and continued to be
monitored. He was on levophed overnight and received 5 RBC, 2
FFP, and 1 platelet transfusion.

Large volume hematochezia then ensued at approximately 6:30-7:00
AM on [**2199-8-17**] and the massive transfusion protocol was activated
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. He is being actively transfused at the time of
this note.

NG lavage was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] with return of
BRB. This had been done earlier by the MICU attending overnight
with return of bile and water. GI has been emergently consulted
for EGD.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 yo M with h/o LURT and pancreas (failed) after kidney
presented to the ED with massive GI bleed concerning for fistula
between pancreatic allograft and bowel. He was sent emergently
to IR for localization of bleed. Mesenteric Angiogram did not
reveal any extravasation. Several hours later, he experienced
another massive GI bleed and was taken back for angiography that
demonstrated likely fistula from the artery in the pancreatic
allograft to the small bowel. The balloon was inflated in the
right common iliac artery to achieve control. He experienced
hypovolemia as well as  compartment syndrome and coded. ACLS
protocol was initiated with resuscitation. He required emergent
exploratory laparotomy in radiology with ligation of arterial
inflow to pancreatic allograft, small bowel resection, bilateral
chest tube placement, and removal of percutaneously placed right
common iliac balloon. Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. See operative
note for complete details. Postop, he was taken intubated to the
SICU. Chest tubes remained to water seal without pneumothorax
noted on CXR. Insulin drip was started.

On [**2199-8-19**], he was taken to the OR by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for
exploratory laparotomy with enteroenterostomy and abdominal wall
closure. Postop, he returned to the SICU intubated. On [**8-20**], a
bronchoscopy was done for mucus plugs. BAL was negative. He
received broad spectrum antibiotic coverage. A lasix drip was
started for massive edema.

On [**8-22**], he was extubated with chest tubes remaining to water
seal. Lasix drip continued. On [**8-23**], interventional radiology
placed a right common iliac artery covered stent over the
arterio-jejunal fistula. A post pyloric tube was also placed by
radiology. Radiology removed the bilateral groin sheaths without
incident. On [**8-23**], bilateral CT's were removed with post CXR
demonstrating a tiny L apical PTX that resolved spontaneously.

Plavix 300mg was initiated. Trophic trophic tube feeds were
started and advanced to goal. Free water flushes were given for
hypernatremia. On [**8-25**] 2 units of PRBC were given for a Hct of
23.4. Hct remained stable. On [**8-25**], Vanco and Zosyn were started
for empiric pneumonia coverage. CXR showed bilateral perihilar
(right greater than left)and bibasilar (left greater than right)
opacities and bilateral pleural effusions. Lasix drip was
continued for generalized edema.

NG tube was removed and diet was advanced to a DM diet. Insulin
drip continued. Aspirin was restarted. Oxycodone was given for
pain control. He developed a metabolic alkalosis and Lasix drip
was held. Diamox was given x2. Urine output remained adequate.

On [**8-27**], he was pancultured for leukocytosis (13.6, 12.8). Blood
and urine cultures remained negative. CXR showed improved
pleural effusions. CMV and BK viral loads were sent and returned
negative.

On [**8-28**], he self-d/c'd the feeding tube and was experiencing
nausea and bilious emesis. KUB did not show signs of
obstruction. On [**8-29**], a CT scan with PO contrast demonstrated
partial SBO dilated bowel proximal to anastomosis and
decompressed bowel distally, positive contrast in colon. He was
kept NPO and was started on TPN. NG continu
