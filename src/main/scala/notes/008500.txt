Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 67385**] was admitted preoperatively for a brain MRI/MRA which
showed recanalization of R MCA with no evidence of new infarcts.
She was seen in consultation by neurology who felt that there
were no finding to preclude surgery from a stroke perspective.
She was taken to the operating room on [**2158-10-10**] where she
underwent an AVR with a pericardial tissue valve. She was
tansferred to the SICU in critical but stable condition. She was
extubated  and weaned from her vasoactive drips by POD #1. She
had some atrial fibrillation for which she was started on
amiodarone. She was transferred to the floor on POD #2. She was
started on coumadin for atrial fibrillation. She did well post
operatively, and she was screened for rehab.
