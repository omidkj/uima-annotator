HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to Cardiac Surgery
and was started on heparin.  On hospital day number two, the
patient was afebrile, vital signs stable.  He had duplex
carotid ultrasound which showed no significant stenosis.

The patient was scheduled for a coronary artery bypass graft,
however, Anesthesia had some concerns about the patient's
pulmonary status, so the operation was postponed.  A
Pulmonary consultation was obtained and the patient was
started on Levaquin.  Pulmonary recommendation was that the
patient is in a good shape to undergo surgery.  His pulmonary
function tests were normal.  He should be continued on
Levaquin and Pulmonary Service would follow the patient
postoperatively.

The patient also developed gross hematuria which resolved
after the patient's heparin was stopped.  Cardiology was also
consulted and recommended discontinuing the patient's
Losartan preoperatively.  They continued him on Lasix for
congestive heart failure.

The patient was taken to the Operating Room on [**9-6**] for
a coronary artery bypass graft times two with a left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending, and saphenous
vein graft to obtuse marginal 3 was performed.  The operation
went without complications.  The patient had pacing wires as
well as mediastinal pleural chest tubes placed
interoperatively and was transferred to the PACU in stable
condition.

Postoperative day number one, the patient was extubated
without complications.  He was slowly weaned off his drips
and remained stable.  Postoperative day number two, his chest
tube and arterial line were removed without complications.
The patient started ambulating.  Pulmonary revisited the
patient and found him to be in great shape respiratory and
with no further intervention from the service.

Postoperative day number three, the patient had an episode of
atrial fibrillation.  He responded well to Amiodarone bolus
and was started on p.o. Amiodarone.  He was also started on
Lopressor.  The patient was transferred to the floor in
stable condition.

Postoperative day number four, the patient's wires were
removed.  The patient is doing well, ambulating, working with
Physical Therapy; no active issues or concerns.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. twice a day times ten days.
3.  Potassium Chlamydia 20 mEq p.o. twice a day times ten
days.
4.  Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. twice a day.
5.  Amiodarone 400 mg three times a day p.o. times four days,
then 400 mg p.o. twice a day times seven days, then 400 mg
p.o. q. day.
6.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q. four to six hours
