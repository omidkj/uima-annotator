Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Sulfa (Sulfonamides)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Recurrent pleural effusions

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left Thoracentesis and Pleurodesis
Right Thoracentesis


History of Present Illness:
81 yo female with pmhx sig for COPD, pulm htn, htn, who
initially presented to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**2117-6-17**] with
increasing SOB and worsening bilateral lower extremity edema.
Pt was initially admitted to the medicine service, then
transferred to ICU for hypotension and hypoxemia.  She was found
to have bilateral pleural effusions, underwent thoracentesis x
2.  She was started on IV steroids and antibiotics for possible
pneumonia.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further work-up
including possible right heart cath to eval for pulm
hypertension and evaluation for possible pleuredisis to prevent
recurrent pleural effusions. On arrival to ICU, pt denie history
of cough, fevers or chills.  No hemoptysis, able to ambulate
limited distances before becoming dyspneic, unable to climb
stairs.  Denies any recent chest pain or pleuritis.

Past Medical History:
pacemaker, HTN, COPD, colon polyps, question of CHF, spontaneous
pneumothorax, a-fib w/ RVR


Social History:
Lives with husband, no ETOH or illicits, quit smoking 24 years
ago, previous 2ppd history x 36 years.  Three children.

none significant

bed
HEENT: atraumatic, anicteric, EOMI, dry mucosal membranes
NECK: no JVD, no LAD

Pertinent Results:
OSH:
CT W/O CONTRAST: emphysematous changes in the apecices.  Large
B/L pleural effusions, no LAD
.
ECHO: enlarged RV, PASP about 80, EF 55-60%
.
EKG: paced
.
LENIS: negative for DVT
.
ECHO [**6-23**]: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. [Intrinsic right
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-19**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant
pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

.
[**6-23**] Cytology Pleural Fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
.
[**6-24**] CXR: Chest tube is present in the left mid hemithorax. No
pneumothorax. No change in the small left pleural effusion since
the previous film of the same date. There has however been a
reduction in the size of the right pleural effusion. Was this
aspirated ? No pneumothorax. Chamber left-sided pacemaker.
.
[**6-24**] PICC placement under fluoro: Successful placement of dual
lumen PICC via the right basilic vein with termination in the
distal SVC. The line is now ready for use.
.
[**6-24**] CXR: The left pleural catheter is in unchanged position with
slightly decreased amount of pleural effusion. No pneumothorax
is identified. There is decrease in the amount of right pleural
effusion which is still mild to moderate in size which can be at
least partially explained by different position of the patient.
No evidence of pulmonary edema is present. Pacemaker leads
terminate in the right atrium and right ventricle.
.
[**6-24**] Cytology Pleural Fluid: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Reactive mesothelial cells, histiocytes and lymphocytes.
.
[**6-27**] RUE U/S: No evidence of DVT in the right upper extremity.
.
[**6-27**] CXR PA/LAT: There are small-to-moderate bilateral
effusions, slightly larger than on [**2117-6-24**], with underlying
collapse and/or consolidation. The lungs are otherwise grossly
clear. A right-sided PICC line is present, tip over distal SVC.
Pacemaker again noted. No CHF.
.
[**6-29**] Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion. Compared with the findings of the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2117-6-23**], the findings are
similar.
.
CTA Chest [**6-30**]: 1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Prominence
of the main pulmonary artery could be consistent with underlying
pulmonary hypertension. 2. Moderate right pleural effusion and
adjacent compressive atelectasis. Smaller left pleural effusion,
with left apical chest tube in place, and adjacent atelectasis.
3. Heterogeneous left lobe of the thyroid, with foci of
calcification and hypodensity. Thyroid ultrasound is recommended
for further evaluation. 4. Mild-to-moderate apical predominant
panacinar emphysema.
.
R Heart Cath [**7-1**]: 1. Normal filling pressures. 2. Mild
pulmonary hypertension with slight improvement in cardiac index
and pulmonary vascular resistance on 100% O2.
.
[**7-2**] CXR: Right pleural effusion has nearly resolved following
thoracentesis with no evidence of pneumothorax. However, left
pleural effusion has increased in size and is now moderate. Left
chest tube remains in place with no evidence of left
pneumothorax. Right lower lobe atelectasis has resolved, but
left basilar atelectasis has worsened in the setting of
increasing effusion.
.
[**7-2**] Pleural Fluid Cytology: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Reactive mesothelial cells, histiocytes and lymphocytes.
.
CXR [**7-4**]: Interval increase in small right pleural effusion. A
left pleural effusion is no longer evident. There is interval
development of a small to moderate left pneumothorax
post-thoracentesis.
.
CXR [**7-7**]: Left-sided chest tube remains in place with persistent
small-to-moderate left pneumothorax with both apical and basilar
components. Allowing for slightly lower lung volumes on today's
study, this is not substantially changed. Moderate right pleural
effusion has slightly increased compared to the recent
examination. There is otherwise no substantial change from the
recent study.
.
CXR [**7-8**]: Persistent small left apical pneumothorax, but
slightly smaller, with a new small left-sided effusion.
.
CXR [**7-12**]: Slightly smaller left apical pneumothorax. Enlargement
of right effusion.
