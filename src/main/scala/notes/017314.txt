Service:  C-MED

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73 year old man
with long cardiac history, hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, hepatitis B, who was admitted for
shortness of breath.  Patient's cardiac history began back in
[**2128**] when he had an anterior MI at age 46 complicated by
v-fib arrest and subsequently he underwent CABG at [**Hospital1 2025**] with
SVG times two to the LAD.  In [**2132**] he had an inferior MI and
at [**Hospital1 2025**] had repeat CABG times two SVGs to RCA and first
diagonal.  In [**2145**] he underwent catheterization and PTCA
times two vessels in [**Location (un) **].  He also had PTCA times two
vessels at [**Hospital1 2025**] in [**2145**].  He reportedly did well since then
until [**2159-7-16**] when he developed chest pain and dyspnea on
exertion.  Catheterization on [**8-10**] showed severe left main
coronary artery disease.  Left main had a 90% distal lesion
with thrombus involving the origins of both the LAD and the
left circumflex.  The LAD was totally occluded in the
mid-vessel after the take-off D2.  The left circumflex had a
50% proximal lesion that was subtotally occluded after OM1
with faint filling of the small OM2 and OM3 branches.  There
was 90% distal LAD stenosis to SVG.  Circumflex was 100%
midstenosis.  SVG to LAD had 60% ostial stenosis, 80% distal
before the anastomoses.  Occluded SVG to D1 and RCA.  He
underwent CABG times six with LIMA to LAD, left radial to
PDA, SVG to D1, SVG to D2, SVG to OM1 and OM2.  Post-op
course complicated by fever and ventilator dependence.  He
was eventually stabilized and weaned off the ventilator.
Cath showed EF of 30% pre-op and 20% post-op.  There was no
mitral regurgitation.  In [**2159-9-16**] patient was admitted
again on transfer from [**Hospital1 1774**].  Echo showed depressed ejection
fraction 15% to 20%, 4+ MR [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1774**].  Echo here revealed
dilated LV with 2+ MR.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] underwent repeat cath with
delay in intervention due to hemodynamic instability
secondary to elevated LV and diastolic pressures.  Pressures
then RA 8, RV 40 and 9, PA 46/40, PCWP 26, cardiac output
4.8, cardiac index 2.8, PA sat 67%.  He then underwent PTCA
of 80% stenosis of SVG to the jump graft at the touch-down
site of OM2.  Of note, he had a six beat run of MSVT.  Since
then patient has had daily chest pain with dyspnea.  He was
admitted in early [**Month (only) 359**] with CHF and chest pain, diuresed
and now returns with the same symptoms.  Patient states that
he has never felt well since the CABG mainly complains of
dyspnea with daily chest pain.  He has also had decreased
weight, loss of appetite, PND and orthopnea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease and CHF as
mentioned above.  Left bundle branch block.  MR 2+.
Hypertension.  Hepatitis B.  Radiculopathy.  Lumbar sciatica.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Coreg
6.25 mg b.i.d., Lasix 60 mg p.o. q.d., Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
q.d., sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin causes a rash.  Morphine causes
hypotension.  Sulfa, iodine, codeine and Benadryl.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Decreased weight.  Decreased energy and
appetite.  Question of depression.  No thyroid symptoms.  No
skin changes.  No GU, GI or diabetic symptoms.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Positive for coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive previous tobacco history.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile temperature
97.6, heart rate 101, blood pressure 92/62, respiratory rate
18, 96% on 2 liters.  Patient in no acute distress.  Head and
neck exams were normal.  No JVD.  Supple neck.  He had a
displaced PMI.  He had a summation gallop, systolic murmur.
Bibasilar decreased breath sounds with rales on chest exam.
He had some right upper quadrant tenderness, hepatomegaly.
No peripheral edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  EKG showed old left bundle branch block.
Hematocrit 34.4.  Chemistries were essentially normal with
BUN and creatinine of 31 and 1.0.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted, diuresed with IV
Lasix.  He was started on digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d. and
Aldactone 12.5 mg p.o. q.d. as per the recommendations of
heart failure service.  He was given one dose of Zaroxolyn
2.5 mg p.o. q.d.  He was transferred to the CCU when a bed
became available for [**Location (un) **] therapy.  Patient was swaned.
The Swan showed CVP of 2, [**MD Number(3) 105751**] 15, wedge pressure 9,
cardiac output 4.7.  Numbers revealed intravascular dryness.
he received some fluid, was optimized hemodynamically.  There
was a question of whether he had some pulmonary process in
view of the fact that he had continued dyspnea and abnormal
chest x-ray despite aggressive diuresis with decreased
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.  Chest CT was obtained
showing signs of CHF.  Pulmonary consult was called who
evaluated patient and attributed the shortness of breath to
cardiac causes and recommended either monitoring the pleural
effusion, which would like resorb with time, versus tapping
the pleural effusion.  It was decided, since the pleural
effusions were relatively small, to just watch the pleural
effusion and let it resorb on its own.

The patient was then transferred back to C-Med service
without chest pain, with improvement in his respiratory
status on the following regimen: aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.,
Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d., carvedilol 3.125 mg p.o. b.i.d. that
was halved from his home regimen, Lasix 80 mg IV b.i.d.,
digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d., Aldactone 12.5 mg p.o. q.d.,
Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.  Lasix was switched from 80 mg IV
b.i.d. to 80 mg p.o. q.a.m. and 40 mg p.o. q.p.m.  Captopril
6.25 mg p.o. t.i.d. was restarted.  Patient tolerated his
regimen well, remained relatively symptom-free and was
discharged in stable condition.
