Brief Hospital Course:
1) C. DIFF COLITIS:
Pt had been on flagyl and vanco at OSH with improvement.  His
symptoms had mostly resolved by arrival here.  He was continued
on PO flagyl and PO vanco here.  Abd pain and diarrhea resolved.
 Both were continued for 2 weeks.
.
2) Esophageal Ulcer:
The esophageal ulcer was cauterized and injected.  EGD was
repeated here and did not show any active bleeding.  Pt was kept
on high dose PPI and Hct was stable.  Received call from OSH
that there was concern there could have been esophageal
perforation during EGD.  A chestCT was done here which did not
show any evidence of this.
.
3) ANASARCA:
Pt had peripheral edema, ascites, and pleural effusions.  It was
likely due to fluids received during sepsis and hypoalbunemia.
He was started on lasix for diuresis

4) COPD
Pt improved with inhaled steroids and bronchodilators.
