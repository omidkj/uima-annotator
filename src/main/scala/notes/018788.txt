Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue, shortness of breath, edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
This patient is a 65 year old male with history of type 1
diabetes melltius for 35 years (A1c 6.7), kidney transplant in
[**2165**], who was transferred from [**Hospital3 24012**] ED where he
presented with fatigue x5 days, worsening edema and mild dyspnea
on exertion. He was was in the ER to have acute on chronic renal
failure with a creatinine of 5.6, hyponatremia to 113 and
question of PNA on chest Xray.

Patient reports feeling extremely week for the past 5 days. He
complaints of extreme fatigue preventing him from getting up on
his own. he denies fevers, chills. he complains of some
difficulty breathing and orthopnea for the past week. He has
been nauseated with dry heave for the past 5 days. He has also
noticed increased scrotal edema x1 month and periorbital edema
occassionally for the past month. He has had worsening LE edema
since [**Month (only) **] and was started on lasix in the beginning of
[**Month (only) 462**]. He reports no change in his urination, denies
frequency or burning. No changed in the color. His stool has
changed, as he goes about 3 times a day now, and previously he
was constipated. He also reports decreased PO intake

His issues started around last [**Month (only) 547**] when he had an epsidode of
vomitting in the setting of 4 days of constipation. This
resolved, but he remained weak since then. He went to [**State **]
for a week at the end of [**Month (only) 116**] and that is when he first noticed
swelling in his feet. He recalls that the swelling has been
getting worse slowly since then. He finally called his
nephrologist Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] in the middle of [**Month (only) **] who scheduled an
ECHO and requested him to have his labs drawn. He also adjusted
the dosages of his Tacro.

The patient went to [**Hospital3 24012**] [**7-22**] or low blood sugar and
again [**2177-7-28**] because he was feeling very weak. At that time he
was found to have low sodium and chloride and low blood count
and was given 2 units of blood and 2 bags of NS (according to
wife). He felt much better after this admission, was able to
take long walks with his wife, and his appetite returned. This
last until 5 days ago when he started with the above symptoms.

In the ED his blood pressure ranged from 151-208/77-106, T 97,
HR 65-79, RR 16 sat 100% RA. He was fiven LEvaquin 750mg IV,
Lasix 80mg IV, labetolol 10mg IV, Compazine 10mg IV. He put out
1300 cc lasix after a foley was placed.

Chest x-ray [**2177-8-21**]:
CONCLUSION:

Pulmonary edema, likely cardiogenic. Bibasal effusions.
Increased density at right lung base, confluent edema versus
pneumonia. Followup post diuresis is recomended.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


Renal Ultrasound [**2177-8-21**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of mild-to-moderate hydronephrosis
within the
transplanted kidney.
2. Slight broadening of the waveform of the mid pole renal
artery,
hoever resistive indices within normal range

Transthoracic Echo [**2177-8-22**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler
and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II
(moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is no left
ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior report (images
unavailable for review) of [**2170-10-1**], concentric left
ventricular hypertrophy and moderate diastolic dysfunction now
evident.

IMPRESSION: moderate diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle
with normal ejection fraction


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 65 year old male with type one diabetes mellitus,
renal transplant in [**2165**], gastroparesis, who presented with
fatigue, hyponatremia, worsening edema, dyspnea on exertion, and
worsening renal insufficiency who was transferred from an
outside hospital for further management.

Patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit. The
nephrology team was consulted and discussed dialysis with the
patient. He refused dialysis, and was able to state the risks
associated with doing so. He understood what dialysis entailed,
and was also not interested in temporary dialysis. It was
recommended that he be treated with trial hypertonic saline to
see if there was improvement in his hyponatremia and energy
level. He refused to stay as an inpatient and declined a PICC
line for administration of hypertonic saline. He was evaluated
by the psychiatry team to help assess whether there was a
component of depression, and
