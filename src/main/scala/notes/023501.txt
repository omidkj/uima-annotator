Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] y.o. female with past medical history of CAD,
critical AS, hypertension, and radiation proctitis who presented
to the emergency department after sustaining an unwitnessed fall
this morning. The patient was moving from a commode to the bed
when she sustained a fall. The exact circumstances of this fall
are unclear. She does not remember experiencing any chest pain,
shortness of breath. The patient's son, who lives with her,
heard her fall and found her on the ground lying on her left
side. She was oriented and appropriate but complaining of severe
left arm pain.


In the ED initial vitals T 96.8, HR 72, BP 141/88, RR 16, O2 Sat
91% on RA. She went for radiographs, which revealed a left
femoral neck fracture, and then became hypotensive to 70s after
returning from radiology. She had some sensation of dizziness
and appeared pale but denied any localizing pain symptoms or
shortness of breath. She vomited once. After receving 3 L of IVF
her SBP's improved to the 90's but then drifted back down to the
70's. Serial ECG with baseline LVH but transient STE in V2. 1st
set of cardiac enzymes was negative. The patient endorsed mild
abdominal pain but denies chest pain, dyspnea, or presyncope.
She has had normal BM's. Vitals at time of signout T 96.5, AF
100-117, BP 80/45, RR 16, O2 97% on 2L.


Currently, she reports [**10-30**] left shoulder pain but denies any
chest pain, dyspnea, or other acute symptoms at this time.


Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: On review of systems, she endorses chronic
minimally productive cough as well as mild abdominal pain and
loose stools related to her radiation proctitis. She denies any
prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint
pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. She denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock
or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

STUDIES:
SHOULDER (AP, NEUTRAL & AXILLARY) TRAUMA LEFT Study Date of
[**2146-1-31**] 10:06 AM
FINDINGS: Total of two views of the left shoulder were obtained.
There is an acute fracture involving the left humeral neck with
impaction and slight medial displacement of the distal fracture
fragment. No additional fractures are seen.
IMPRESSION: Left humeral neck fracture.
.
CHEST (SINGLE VIEW) Study Date of [**2146-1-31**] 10:06 AM
FINDINGS: AP upright view of the chest is obtained. There is an
acute fracture involving the left humeral neck with a slightly
impacted appearance and medial displacement of the distal
fragment. Patient is rotated to left with a marked scoliotic
deformity, which limits evaluation through the chest, though
there is no definite evidence of lung consolidation, effusion,
or pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly
stable. Bones are demineralized.
IMPRESSION: Left humeral neck fracture. Otherwise, no acute
findings.
.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2146-2-1**] at 9:42:07 AM
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. [Due
to acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic regurgitation may
be significantly UNDERestimated.] The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve
leaflets are thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Critical aortic stenosis. Moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with vigorous left ventricular systolic
function. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe
tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
