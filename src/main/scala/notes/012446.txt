Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 896**]
Chief Complaint:
Pulmonary embolism


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
62 y/o M with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, Crohn's disease, and
recent extensive spinal fusion surgery [**08**] days ago, presenting
to the ED with dyspnea. Yesterday morning, the patient first
noticed feeling dyspnic when walking to his bathroom. The same
sensation occurred several times later with minimal activity.
The patient called a friend of his who is a physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was
recommended to come to the ED to be evaluated for PE.
.
Since the patient's surgery, he had poor PO intake for the first
several days. He eventually was discharged home and was not
taking any anticoagulation agents. He was instructed to continue
taking his daily aspirin 81 mg, which he had stopped one week
prior to his surgery. He measures his blood pressures at home,
and noted that several days ago, his systolic BP was measuring
in the 80s; he typically has BP's in the 110s/70s. He has had
little physical activity, spending much of his days sitting or
lying down.
.
In the ED, triage vital signs were 98.0, 103, 133/64, 18, 100%
on room air. The patient reported ongoing dyspnea but denied
chest pain or palpitations. On exam, the patient was reportedly
comfortable, with a regular heart rate, clear lungs, and no JVD
or lower extremity edema. DRE was guaiac negative. Labs were
notable for Hct 36.0, troponin T 0.06. ECG reportedly showed T
wave inversions in leads V1-V4. CXR was unremarkable, aside from
presence of surgical hardware. CTA revealed bilateral saddle
pulmonary embolism extending into subsegmental pulmonary
arteries, as well as straightening of the interventricular
septum. He was started on a heparin drip, and given 2 tabs of
oxycodone-acetaminophen for pain.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient has no complaints, other
than feeling hungry and requesting to be able to sit in a chair.
He denies current dyspnea, as long as he is still. Denies
significant back pain, in the setting of having received
percocet in the ED. Denies chest pain, cough, fever, chills,
hematuria, dark stools, or nausea.


Past Medical History:
-[**2101-8-30**]: Decompressive laminectomy L1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 for
decompression of severe lumbar stenosis associated with
degenerative scoliosis. Osteotomies L1-2, L3-4, L4-5 for
correction of degenerative scoliosis. Transverse process and
interlaminar fusion, T10-S1. Sacral pelvic fusion S1 and iliac
crest. Segmental titanium [**Last Name (un) **] instrumentation T10-S1 with sacral
pelvic fixation to the iliac crest. No reported complications,
800 cc EBL.

NEURO: AAOx3. Cn II-XII intact. 5/5 strength throughout. No
sensory deficits to light touch appreciated.
RECTAL:  Deferred. Was reportedly guaiac negative in ED


Pertinent Results:
EKG: Sinus rhythm @ 87 bpm. Low voltage in limb leads. Normal
axis, normal intervals. T wave inversions present in V1-V4 (new
from prior ECGs of [**2095**] & [**2099**]). No ST segment elevations or
depressions. Borderline pathologic Q waves in V1 (seen on prior
ECGs), though sub-mm upward deflection is apparent.
.
Imaging:
[**2101-9-17**] CXR: PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained.
Serial fusion hardware along the lower thoracic and upper lumbar
spine is noted. The lungs appear clear bilaterally. No pleural
effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
is normal. Bony structures are intact. A tunneled screw is noted
in the left humeral head.
.
[**2101-9-17**] CTA:
INDICATION: 62-year-old man with recent surgery. Shortness of
breath.
Assess for pulmonary embolism.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: Axially acquired images were obtained through the
chest prior to and after the administration of 100 cc of Optiray
intravenous contrast.  Coronal, sagittal, and right and left
oblique reformatted images were also displayed.
.
FINDINGS: There is a saddle embolus at the bifurcation of main
pulmonary
artery, extending bilaterally to the subsegmental level. There
is relative
sparing of the apical segments of both lungs. Otherwise, PE is
seen diffusely. In addition, there is flattening of the
interventricular septum and enlargement of the right ventricle,
concerning for right heart strain. There is no lymphadenopathy.
Lungs are clear of nodule, mass, or consolidation. There is no
pleural effusion or pericardial effusion.
Visualized aspects of the upper abdomen are within normal
limits.
.
BONES: Posterior spinal fusion is seen in the lower thoracic
spine,
incompletely visualized.
 .
IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with massive PE. Findings were
discussed
with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15785**] immediately after review at
approximately 4:45 p.m. on [**2101-9-17**].

Brief Hospital Course:
62 y/o M with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, Crohn's disease,
presenting with saddle PE, 18 days out from spinal surgery.
.
#  Pulmonary embolism: Main risk factor is post-operative
immobilization. Does report family history of DVT in maternal GM
and (hemorrhagic) CVA in his sister, but no clotting disorders
have been diagnosed. Stable vital signs and oxygen saturation on
arrival. Patient did not have indications for thrombolytic
therapy (e.g. severe, persistent hypotension), although troponin
elevation and flattening of interventricular septum on CTA may
indicate RV strain/dysfunction from clot burden. He was admitted
from the Emergency departement on a heparin drip and was
transitioned to Lovenox and coumadin.  Daily INR and coagulation
studies were followed.  Contact was made with his p
