Brief Hospital Course:
By the time of Mr. [**Known lastname 39898**] arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], his AG was 16,
with a VBG pH of 7.31. He was maintained on an insulin gtt and
D5NS until his AG closed during day 1 of his admission. His CXR
and UA showed no evidence of infection, and his blood and urine
cultures had no growth. He was afebrile. Given his GI symptoms
that preceded the onset of his DKA, it was thought that the
precipitating event was a viral gastrointestinal illness. He
continued to c/o mild epigastric pain during the first day of
his admission, and it was noted that his amylase, which was
somewhat elevated at admission, continued to trend up, even as
his AG closed. A RUQ U/S was done, which revealed a slightly
atrophic pancreas consistent with T1DM, and no other evidence of
intrabdominal pathology. His pain resolved, and this and the
elevated amylase were attributed to his DKA. He was started on a
PO diet with sliding scale subcutaneous insulin coverage, which
he tolerated well, and 2 hours after his meal, his insulin drip
and IVF were d/c'ed. [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for recommendations
for insulin regimen. Per their advice, he was maintained on his
previous dose of glargine. He was started on 10U humalog with
meals, plus SSI. Mr. [**Known lastname **] experienced an episode of
post-prandial hypoglycemia on this regimen, and his humalog was
switched to 8U with meals, plus SSI. Diet and management of
blood sugar was discussed with the patient and his parents.
Attempts were made to call Mr. [**Known lastname **] to the general floor, but
no beds were available, and he was ultimately d/c'ed home
directly from the ICU. He was instructed to follow up with his
diabetologist at [**Last Name (un) **] within the next two weeks, and to the
return to the ED with any concerning symptoms. He was given
details of his new regimen and expressed understanding of the
importance of keeping to this regimen.
