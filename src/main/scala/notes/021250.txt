History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 8884**] is a 66 yo F with a 6-month history of ulcer on her
left 3rd toe.  She has been followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8885**] of podiatry
in [**Location (un) **].  She reports that she last saw him three weeks ago
and he thought her toe was improving.  Two weeks ago, she began
to have increasing pain in her toe and instep, and noticed that
her toe appeared darker.  Her cousin, with whom she lives,
noticed her rubbing her toe frequently and encouraged her to see
a doctor, but she did not.  One week ago, she noticed redness on
the dorsal aspect of her foot.  She finally saw her podiatrist
[**1-2**] and he sent her to the ED. She describes her pain as [**2-4**],
in her 3rd toe and instep of her left foot.  Additionally, she
complains of a stinging pain in her great toes bilaterally
secondary to gouty arthritis.  She has remained afebrile. She
denies prior foot ulcers or injury, as well as numbness or
tingling in her feet.  She notes that she normally moves freely
about her home, and climbs stairs several times a day to do
laundry.  She has had recent falls without injury after tripping
over the cord for an electrical blanket.  On review of systems,
she has had recent nosebleed and asthmatic symptoms.  She denies
HA, dizziness, CP, SOB, fevers/chills, abdominal discomfort,
dysuria, urgency, or muscular weakness.  She has had some recent
intentional weight loss.

Studies:
[**1-2**] XR left foot: IMPRESSION: 1. Indistinct cortical contour of
terminal tuft of the left third distal phalanx, concerning for
osteomyelitis, related to an adjacent ulcer.
2. Cystic change in the first metatarsal head is likely
degenerative, related to the hallux valgus deformity, although
the less likely possibility of gout could be considered in the
appropriate clinical setting.
3. [**Month/Day (1) **] calcifications.

bilateral popliteal/tibial artery occlusive disease with severe
flow deficit to both forefeet.

saphenous veins are patent bilaterally.  Please see digitized

.
[**1-6**] Stress P-MIBI: IMPRESSION: No anginal symptoms with an
uninterpretable EKG for ischemia. Normal pharmacologic
myocardial perfusion study with normal left ventricular wall
motion and cavity size.  Compared with the study of [**2100-9-17**], no
significant change.
.
[**1-6**] Dialysis Catheter Placement: IMPRESSION:  Successful
placement of right internal jugular tunneled hemodialysis
catheter with tip in the right atrium.  The catheter is now
ready for use.
.
[**1-9**] Pre-op CXR IMPRESSION: 1.  Small bilateral pleural
effusions with no evidence of parenchymal consolidation.  Mild
symettric [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] promince suggests possible fluid overload
related to underlying renal condition.
.
[**1-9**] Pre-op EKG Regular ventricular pacing; Atrial flutter;
Since previous tracing, atrial flutter more apparent.
