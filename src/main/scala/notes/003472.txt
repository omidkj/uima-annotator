Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
lower extremity weakness & numbness (right>left)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Laminectomy T9 and 10, removal of epidural cyst, and dural
closure.


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 33 yo male with a history of alcohol dependence and
peripheral neuropathy who presents with two days of bilateral
lower extremity weakness and numbness. Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 79121**] was in his
usual state of health until two days ago when he woke up with
numbness and pain in both of his legs (R>L), starting at the
feet and tracking upward. Though he has had peripheral
neuropathy in his legs in the past, the current episode of pain
was by far the most severe of his life, and in fact he was
unable to walk or even bear weight. He was seen at [**Hospital 47**]
Hospital where MRI of the thoracic spine revealed a mass at the
level of T10, initially thought to be consistent with an
epidural abscess. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical
consideration. The mass was reomoved and found to be consistent
with a cyst. It was not felt that this mass could explain the
presenting symptoms, and in fact Mr. [**Known lastname 6483**] reports little or
no improvement since surgery. Currently, he reports numbness and
pain in both legs (R>L)most intense at the foot and extending up
to the ankle.

.
Imaging:
MRI T-Spine ([**2168-9-26**]):Dorsal and right lateral epidural fluid
intensity lesion at T9-10 level. The absence of enhancement
centrally or peripherally argues against the finding being an
epidural phlegmon or abscess, and favors an arachnoid cyst.
.
MRI L-Spine ([**2168-9-27**]): No evidence of discitis, osteomyelitis, or
epidural abscess. Mild spondylosis at L4/5 and L5/S1. A left
paracentral disc protrusion at L5/S1 may contact to the left S1
nerve root in the lateral recess.
.
CXR ([**2168-9-27**]): In comparison with the study of [**9-26**], there is no
interval change. Specifically, there is no evidence of pneumonia
to explain the postoperative fever.
.
TTE [**9-27**]: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
No vegetation seen (cannot definitively exclude).
.
EMG ([**2168-9-28**]): Complex, abnormal study. The electrophysiologic
findings suggest a mild-to- moderate chronic generalized
sensorimotor polyneuropathy with axonal features. The absence of
motor unit activity in right tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius,
and extensor hallucis longus suggests either central nervous
system dysfunction or a severe, acute neurogenic lesion. Coupled
with the ongoing denervation present in right L5 paraspinal
muscles, these findings may reflect an acute (<3 weeks) right
L5-S1 radiculopathy. There is no evidence for a primary
demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, as in Guillain- [**Location (un) **]
syndrome.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 33 yo male with a h/o alcohol dependence
(previous withdrawal and seizures) and peripheral neuropathy who
presented with acute onset bilateral lower extremity weakness
and numbness (R>L), still of uncertain etiology. Patient is now
s/p surgical laminectomy T9/T10 and removal of epidural cyst.
.
1) Lower extremity numbness and weakness: Patient presented with
sudden onset of this weakness/numbness on [**2168-9-25**]. Initial
imaging was suspicious for an epidural abscess, which later
proved to be an epidural cyst upon resection. Laminectomy and
removal of the cyst did not ameliorate the symptoms. Over the
course of the hospitalization, the LLE improved to 5/5 strength
throughout with minimal sensory deficits. In contrast, the RLE
remained with 1-2/5 strength on plantar flexion and dorsiflexion
at the ankle, and [**4-30**] flexion at the knee, otherwise [**5-30**].
Sensory deficits in the LLE also improved though not completely.
The patient could ambulate with confidence only with a walker,
but dragged his right foot. He was started on gabapentin for
neuropathic pain which provided some symptomatic relief.  This
can continue to be uptitrated as an outpatient.
.
These findings were felt to most likley represent a peripheral
neuropathy over a central process. There was no evidence of
demyelination on EMG, arguing against [**Last Name (un) 4584**]-[**Location (un) **]. B12,
folate, TSH, HIV, RPR, Lyme, HBV were normal. HCV antibody was
positive, and this was a new finding to Mr. [**Known lastname 79122**]
knowledge, though viral load was pending at discharge. An LP was
perfomed, revealing protein 75, glucose 61, 10 WBC. An MRI of
the L-Spine was remarkable only for question of a possible disc
protrusion affecting the L5/S1 nerve root on the left, though
Mr. [**Known lastname 79122**] major findings were on the right. A blood smear
did not reveal evidence of lead toxicity (basophilic stippling).
The differential continues to include neuropathy secondary to
alcoholism, hea
