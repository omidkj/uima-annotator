History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 80yoM w/ a h/o AAA (4.2x3.9 by ultrasound
[**7-2**]), COPD, CAD s/p IMI, hyperlipidemia, R common iliac artery
aneurysm (1.9cm [**11-30**]) presents for elective carotid stenting.
The patient had an episode of syncope 2 months prior to
admission, during a syncope workup he was found to have a L ICA
stenosis of 70-90% and < 50% on the R.  Since that episode of
syncope the patient did not have any further episodes.
.
He states that his episode of syncope was as follows: he was
sitting down, eating, felt food getting stuck in his
epigastrium, drank a sip of room temperature water and then his
wife noted him to fall back in his chair and hit the ground, per
the patient the next thing he remembers if being on the ground,

this episode he had an identical episode 4 months prior to
admission.
.
He denies any CP, has stable DOE (3 flights of stairs), has no
pedal edema, denies any stroke or TIA symptoms.

[**2190-5-3**] 04:48PM BLOOD K-4.2

Carotid Angiogram and Left ICA stent [**2190-5-3**]:
1. Access was obtained in retrograde fashion through the right
CFA
artery under USS guidance. A copy of the right CFA USS image was
printed
and attached to patient's note.
2. A 4F Pigtail catheter was advanced into the right ascending
aorta.
Arch angiography revealed a type III arch with 90% left internal
carotid
artery stenosis.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the left internal carotid
artery with
a 10x24mm self expanding Carotid Wall stent that was postdilated
to
4.5mm. Final angiography revealed 10% residual stenosis, no
angiographically apparent dissection and good distal flow (see
PTA
comments).
4. Cerebral angiography revealed left ACA stenosis, patent left
MCA.
5. Lower abdominal arotography revealed:
    - abdominal aortic aneurysm
    - right CIA aneurysm
6. Successful deployment of angioseal closure device.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Carotid stenting: The patient had a type III aortic arch with
90% L carotid stenosis.  There were both an abdominal and iliac
aneurysm (known from previous imaging obtained from OSH).
Difficulty cannulating L carotid, it was eventually stented with
distal protection and 10% residual stenosis.  He had a L ACA
defect (likely stenosis) on angio post procedure.  He was
admitted to the Cardiac ICU for monitoring overnight.  Aspirin
and clopidogrel were conitnued.  Statin was continued.  Serial
neuro exams were normal with no deficits noted.  Blood pressure
was monitored to maintain systolic pressures between 100 and
120; he did not require additional medications to maintain
systolic pressures within this range.  Pain at catheter
insertion site was minimal.  On hospital day 1, he was noted to
be hemodynamically stable with no evidence of complication from
the left internal carotid stent procedure.  He was discharged
home from the ICU to follow-up with his outpatient cardiologist
and primary care physician.

# Hyperlipidemia: Continued Simvastatin

# COPD: On admission, there were no wheezes on exam or other
evidence of COPD exacerbation.  Advair and Spiriva were
continued.
