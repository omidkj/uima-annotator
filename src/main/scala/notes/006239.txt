Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis
Pericardial tap and window


History of Present Illness:
65M with HTN, DM, recent cath 1 week ago for STEMI c/b
pericarditis/DVT/PE with 2 day h/o [**Hospital **] transfer from OSH,
bedside ultrasound with pericardial effusion concerning for
tamponade physiology.
.
Patient was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2-5**]. He initially
presented to [**Hospital3 **] in the setting of URI symptoms and chest
pain. EKG with anterior ST elevations. Heparin and plavix were
initiated and patient was medically managed for two days as he
was felt to be outside the window for acute PCI. He was
eventually taken to Cath revealing 98% mid-LAD lesion. He had a
CK that peaked at 992 and a troponin that was 2.25. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for percutaneous coronoary intervention
where a [**Hospital1 **] was placed in the LAD. ECHO revealed anterior wall
hypokinesis/akinesis.
.
His course was complicated by a superficial femoral vein clot
secondary to known Factor V Leiden mutation (heterozygous). He
has been treated for DVT in the past, and therefore will require
life long anti-coagulation. Due to his persistent sinus
tachycardia both at the time of  presentation, transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]
and his hospital stay, it was presumed that he had a pulmonary
embolus. He was started on warfarin empirically for his apical
hypokinesis, and his INR prior to discharge was 1.4.  He was
sent home with Lovenox.
.
His course was further complicated by pericarditis thought to be
secondary to recent STEMI and not dressler's syndrome given the
proximity of this event.
.
Finally, patient was diagnosed with HCAP and empirically started
on Levaquin.  He then spiked an additional fever, and was
transitioned to Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Ciprofloxacin.  He was
then transitioned to oral antibiotics, and discharged home with
oral cefpodoxime to complete an 8 day course.
.
Since discharge, patient was doing ok until [**2-7**], when he
started to experience fatigue, difficulty breathing,
palpitations, and dull chest pressure. Denied syncope, blood in
his urine, sputum, stool. He was compliant with his discharge
medications.
.
In the ED initial vitals 100.4 136 97/67. Transferred from OSH
where ECHO was peformed and revealed pleural effusion with
question of tamponade physiology. In ED patient was tachycardic
and borderline hypotensive. Pulsus noted at 20mmHg. Bedside US
with pericardial effusion and evidence of RV collapse. CXR
revealed cardiomegaly. EKG with a question of pericarditis
noted. Patient give 2.5 liters of NS. Vitamin K 10mg IV. Vitals
prior to transfer 120 110/70.
.
In the CCU, patient was tachycardic to the 130s, tachypneic to
30, pulsus was 15 mmHg, sBP 110s. He was fairly uncomfortable
and reports a dull left-sided chest pressure that was similar to
prior presentation of STEMI.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains,
cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent
fevers but did feel chills. He denies exertional buttock or calf
pain.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, syncope or
presyncope.

3. Imaging/diagnostics:
- Echo ([**2181-2-9**]): Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 20-25 %) with distal LV and apical
akinesis (there is spontaneous echo contrast (stasis) seen in
the LV apex and an apical thrombus cannot be fully excluded). RV
systolic funciton is depressed. There is a large pericardial
effusion. There is right ventricular diastolic collapse,
consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade physiology.
.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to large pericardial effusion with echo
evidence of tamponade.
.
ECHO [**2-20**]:
IMPRESSION: Severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction, c/w CAD. Mild aortic and mitral regurgitation.
Spontaneous echocontrast in the LV apex, c/w low-flow state.
Very small residual echodense pericardial effusion.
.
CXR [**2181-2-25**]: The left-sided PICC line is unchanged. Mild
cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is a small left pleural
effusion. There is no pneumothorax. There is retrocardiac
opacity consistent with volume loss/infiltrate/consolidation
that is slightly increased in comparison to the prior study. The
right lung shows some minimal volume loss/infiltrate
inferomedially but otherwise is clear.
.
Pericardium biopsy: Pericardium; pericardial window (A): Fibrous
and adipose tissue consistent with pericardium, with surface
fibrin, acute and chronic inflammation and reactive changes.
.
Pleural Fluid [**2-20**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Reactive
mesothelial cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and histiocytes.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE: 65 year-old gentleman with DM2 and HTN who
presented with dyspnea and dull chest pain several days after
hospitalization for STEMI, which was initially treated medically
at an outside hospital for several days prior to admission to
[**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catherization with PCI ([**Hospital1 **] to mid LAD). That
hospital course had been complicated by post-MI pericarditis and
