History of Present Illness:
This 64 year old Cambodian-speaking female presented with
shortness of breath and wheezing which started as she was on her
way to her cardiology appointment. She was evaluated in
pulmonary clinic where she was advised to increase her dose of
Lasix to 80mg daily because she had lower extremity edema and
persistent shortness of breath.  She was unable to do spirometry
but a presumptive diagnosis of asthma/COPD was made. She was
continued on nebulizers and a discussion was had about using a
CPAP or BIPAP machine at home but the patient was not amenable
to this treatment. She was set up with an appointment to follow
up in about a week.

In the meantime lab work drawn revealed a creatinine of 1.6
(baseline over the last year has ranged from 1.2-2.0) and she
was called and told to decrease the Lasix dose back to 40mg
daily because of concern of renal failure. Per her son at home
since discharge in late [**Month (only) 958**] she has been inactive but when she
walks from one room to another in the home she is always short
of breath. When she is sitting she is better. In general when
she goes out it is a big exertion for her and she gets very
short of breath. He notes she has also gained about 10 lbs (her
dry weight is 165lbs) and her leg swelling has gotten worse
since the lasix dose was decreased. In addition she complains of
off and on chest pain which is located in the epigastric region
just below her sternum and lasts for seconds. It feels like a
"punch" and is not worsened with exertion. She has not had
fevers, chills, a cough, or recent travel. There is no one else
sick at home. She denies palpitations. She was not clear about
PND or orthopnea. She has been taking all of her meds regularly,
no missed [**Month (only) 4319**]. she notes her last BM was today however she
does have some abdominal distension and feels full of fluid.
  Today she arrived for her scheduled cardiology follow up
appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and was referred to the emergency
room due to shortness of breath and wheezing.

Social History:
The patient lives with her children and her husband. She is
originally from [**Country **]. She struggles ambulating around the
house and is incapable of all IADLs, and only some ADLs (can
toilet, bath, dress). She denies ever smoking cigarettes but

to the United States in [**2090**]. She is never left alone due to
history of falls.


Family History:
No history of heart disease in the family. One son has asthma.


Physical Exam:
General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress
[**Year (4 digits) 4459**]: Sclera anicteric, MMM,
Neck: obese and unable to detect JVD
Lungs: Diminished BL with crackles at bases and using abdominal
muscles to breathe. no wheezes
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops
Abdomen: non-tender, distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound
tenderness or guarding
Ext: Warm, 2+ pitting edema to knees
Neuro:  A+OX3. Weak RLE with inability to lift it more than an
inch off the bed (per son from old CVA)


Pertinent Results:
EKG:  Sinus rhythm at rate of 70bpm with flat TW III, STD V4-V6
(<2mm) STD ~1mm I, II, III, AVF. Unchanged from ED ECGs and
unchanged from prior dated [**2118-3-25**].

TTE [**2118-4-29**]:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-12-3**],
the degree of MR seen appears less.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted after evaluation in The Emergency Department
for shortness of breath.  She was treated with steroids and
nebulizers in the Emergency Room, however, due to elevated BNP
was felt to be in acute diastolic heart failure.  She was
treated with diuretics.  She underwent cardiac catheterization
for evaluation of possible intervention but was found to have
restenosis of the stents placed previously that was not amenable
to PCI. cardiac surgery was consulted for surgical evaluation.
She underwent preoperative workup that include hepatology
consult due to Hepatitis B and was noted as Childs A.  The
hepatologists recommended discontinuing the Tenofovir after the
surgery until her creatinine was noted to be stable for a couple
days. Urine culture revealed klebsiella in the urine and she was
treated with ciprofloxacin with a repeat urine culture pending
at the time of surgery.  She continued to be diuresed, however,
her creatinine increased and renal was consulted due to history
of chronic kidney disease with evidence of acute injury with
diuresis.  Diuretics were then dosed as needed and creatinine
monitored daily.  Surgery was delayed until improvement of renal
function.  There also was concern for aspiration and a swallow
study was evaluated and she was placed on restriction with 1:1
observation with meals.  She also underwent a barium swallow
which ruled out esophagitis but did reveal tertiary dysmotility.
 Additionally, [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted preoperatively for diabetes
management as she was on U500 at home to assist with blood
glucose management.

On [**5-9**] she was brought to the Operating Room and underwent off
pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery  (see operative report
for further details). She received vancomycin and cefazolin for
perioperative antibiotics and transferred to the intensive care
unit for post operative management.

She was weaned from sedation, however, was resedated due to
dyssynchrony with the ventilator.  She remained intubated and
sedated overnight. She continued to fail weaning of sedation and
remained on Propofol and pressure support ventilation.  A Lasix
