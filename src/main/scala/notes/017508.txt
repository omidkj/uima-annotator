Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2290**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain x 2-3 weeks


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of percutatenous chole drain

History of Present Illness:
78 y/o Cantonese speaking man with history of CAD s/p CABG
([**2118**]), HTN, HLD, and emphysema who presented on [**2124-6-17**] to the
medical floor with 2 weeks epigastric pain. CT abdomen showed
severe duodenitis; surgery and GI were consulted. His original
abdominal exam was consistent with guarding and surgery was
concerned about a perforation but a repeat CT and abdominal
X-ray were not consistent with free air. However, gallbladder
wall thickening with pericholecystic fluid were noted, and his
LFTs were consistent with obstruction, leading to concern for
cholecystittis/cholangitis, and the patient was started on
meropenem and vancomycin. Shortly after his repeat CT scan, he
developed SOB and was tachycardic to the 140s with 3mm ST
elevations in the lateral leads but troponins were negative and
he did not complain of chest pain. There was a concern for
demand ischemia and he was started on heparin gtt. The patient
became hypotensive to an SBP in the 80s after he received
metoprolol, and was transferred to the ICU. He was bolused with
IV fluids and his metoprolol and lisinopril were held; he
received a percutaneous chole drain and he continued to receive
meropenem and vancomycin pending results of blood cultures.  His
vital signs stabilized nicely and he was transferred to medicine
for further management.

On arrival to the medicine floor, his vitals were T99 BP 101/47
HR 75 94% 4L. He complains of RUQ pain. He denies SOB or chest
pain.

CT AP ([**2124-6-17**])
========================
INDICATION:  Abdominal pain for two to three weeks.

Comparison chest CT available from [**2121-11-20**].

TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired 5-mm axial images through the abdomen
and pelvis
were obtained following the uneventful administration of 130 ml
of Omnipaque
intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were
performed at
5-mm slice thickness.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:
Included views of the lung bases demonstrate moderate-to-severe
emphysema with
superimposed bibasilar fibrosis which has progressed since the
most recent
chest CT examination from [**2121-11-20**].  There is no
pericardial or
pleural effusion.  The heart size is top normal.

Extensive stranding surrounds the proximal duodenum (2:26, 27).
No focal
fluid collections are identified.  There is no free air.
Perihepatic free
fluid is present.  A short segment of the proximal jejunum is
mildly distended
(2:48), with neighboring loops demonstrating mild fecalization
(2:31).  No
transition point is seen.  The remaining loops of small and
large bowel are
within normal limits.

The stomach, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, and
gallbladder are
normal.  A well-circumscribed hypodense hepatic lesion within
segment [**Doctor First Name 690**]
(2:11) is minimally enlarged since [**2120**], likely representing a
small cyst or
biliary hamartoma. A 15 mm partially exophytic cyst arising from
the
interpolar region of the right kidney  (2:35) is slightly
enlarged since [**2120**].


There are moderate atherosclerotic calcifications throughout the
abdominal
aorta and iliac branches.  The celiac trunk, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**] are
patent and
normal in caliber.

There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:
The rectum, sigmoid colon, urinary bladder, intrapelvic loops of
small and
large bowel are normal.  The prostate is moderately enlarged
(2:83).  There is
no intrapelvic free fluid or lymphadenopathy.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:
The patient is post-median sternotomy.  No acute fracture is
detected.  There
are no bony lesions concerning for malignancy or infection.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Severe duodenitis.  No secondary signs of perforation.  EGD
is recommended
to assess for further evaluation.
2.  Mild dilatation of a short segment of jejunum, with
fecalization of
contents without transition point. Findings may represent a
focal ileus.
3.  Progression of moderate to severe emphysema and bibasilar
interstitial
fibrosis compared to the [**2120**] CT chest examination.
4.  Small amount of perihepatic ascites. No drainable fluid
collections.
5.  Moderately enlarged prostate.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

KUB [**2124-6-17**]
======================
ABDOMEN

INDICATION:  Duodenitis, evaluation for free air.

COMPARISON:  No comparison available at the time of dictation.

FINDINGS:  Documentation is provided by two radiographic images.
 No free
intra-abdominal air.  Several small air-fluid levels projecting
over
nondistended bowel loops in the mid abdomen.  Colonic air
filling and stool
filling of the ascending and descending colon.  Contrast
material in the
bladder.  Diffuse gas feeling of small bowel loops without
evidence of wall
thickening.  No pathologic calcifications.  No foreign bodies.

CT AP [**2124-6-18**]
==========================
INDICATION:  Duodenitis with increasing abdominal tenderness.

COMPARISON:  CT available from [**2123-12-17**].

TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired 5-mm axial images of the abdomen and
pelvis were
obtained following the uneventful administration of Gastrografin
and 130 ml of
Omnipaque intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
reformations were
performed at 5-mm slice thickness.

DLP: 363 mGy-cm

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:
Moderate right basilar atelectasis is new since the [**2123-12-17**]
examination (2:5).  Again seen is moderate-to-severe bibasilar
emphysema with
superimposed peripheral fibrosis.  There is no pericardial or
pleural
effusion.  The heart size is normal.

Mild heterogenous liver perfusion is noted, predominantly in the
right
anterior and left medial lobes (2:19).  A well-circumscribed
subcentimeter
hypodense hepatic lesion within segment [**Doctor First Name 690**] (2:11) likely
represents a small
cyst or biliary hamartoma.  The portal and hepatic veins remain
patent.

Again seen is moderate stranding around the proximal duodenum
(2:27),
minimally changed since [**2124-6-1
