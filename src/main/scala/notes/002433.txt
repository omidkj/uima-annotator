Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
Intracerebral hemorrhage


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PERCUTANEOUS PLACEMENT JEJUNOGASTROSTOMY TUBE
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
Neurophysiology EEG
CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECO


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 83 yo RHF with h/o pacemaker, AF, multiple valve
replacements, COPD, and anemia who is transferred with a large
ICH.

She was reportedly in her USOH this morning and then was noted
around 11:30 am to be confused and not herself.  She was still
able to walk with her walker though.  She went to an OSH and CT
showed 4x4.3 cm ICH in the right parietal lobe without
ventricular spread.  She is on coumadin and her INR was 3.  She
was given FFP (either 2 or 4 units, records are unclear),
vitamin
K, and then transferred here.  INR here was 1.8.  Head CT here
showed a fairly stable hemorrhage, shift of 2mm(up from 1mm
earlier) with increased effacement of right lateral ventricle,
and no herniation.  She was given Profilnine and started on
Nipride for her BP.  She was loaded with dilantin.

Her family felt she was more tired and groggy than at the OSH,
but otherwise unchanged.  She was switched to labetalol for BP
control and admitted to the ICU. Neurosurgery saw her as well.

ROS: Patient denies HA, but is unable to go through full ROS

PT: 18.9  PTT: 29.4  INR: 1.8

CTA:4.3 x 4.6 cm intraparenchymal right parietal bleed, with
effacement of the right ventricle (increased from outside
study),
minimal midline shift (2 mm).
No obvious AVM or mass, though large bleed limits evaluation of
underlying structural and vascular abnormalities.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 83RHW with h/o pacemaker, AF, multiple valve
replacements with porcine aortic and mitral valves, on coumadin,
COPD, and anemia with a large right parietal bleed.  Exam is
significant for inattention, left neglect and left sided
weakness arm>leg.
.
1. Neuro:  Patient was admited to neuro ICU [**7-12**] -> transferred
to stepdown [**7-13**].  Q2h neuro checks.  Kept head of bed >30
degrees.  Repeat head CT in am [**7-13**] showed area of hemorrhage was
stable.  Neurosurgery was following and no surgical intervention
was indicated.  Dilantin was continued for 1 week as seizure
prophylaxis.  EEG [**7-14**] was negative for epileptiform features.
She was started on Provigil to improve her alertness with good
effect.  Patient will need a follow up CT with contrast after
she recovers from this admission.  Mechanism of bleed was likely
secondary to amyloid angiopathy.
.
2. Cards: Kept systolic BP<150 with metoprolol 5 IV Q6 + hydral
PRN.  Continued Lasix with strict I/Os keeping fluid status
-500cc over 24 hours.  Ruled out for MI.  Atrial fibrillation
was well rate controlled on metoprolol.
.
3. Heme:  Patient received additional FFP to keep INR<1.3 and
Vitamin K 10 mg daily x3 days.  Patient was resumed on aspirin
81 after 1 week as stroke prophylaxis in setting atrial
fibrillation given risk of bleeding on warfarin.
.
4. Pulm:  Continued Advair and Nebs PRN.  Received additional
Lasix 20mg IV as needed to keep fluid status negative for mild
CHF.
.
5. Endo:  Covered insulin sliding scale.  TSH and T4 were
normal.
.
6. FEN:  Kept NPO and placed GJ tube due to failing swallow
evaluation.
.
7. GU:  Continued Ditropan
.
8. PPX:  RISS. PPI. Tylenol prn. Pneumoboots
.
9. CODE:  Full code per discussion with her daughters tonight
.
10. Other:  History of Etoh nightly so on CIWA, thiamine, MVI,
folate replacement
