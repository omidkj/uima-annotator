Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1572**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
80-year-old male with history of CAD s/p CABG x2, chronic
systolic heart failure with EF of 25%, s/p BiV pacemaker with
very recent admission with cellulitis complicated by renal
failure and HD inititiation, PEA arrest, with resultant short
term memory loss and delirium who presents from rehab with
delirium.

The patient was discharged [**4-19**] with a discharge status of
delirium with visual hallucinations and short term confusion who
presented to rehab and was immediately sent back to [**Hospital1 18**] for
concern of mental status. Per report he was given a piece of
paper and attempted to sign it with his finger. For full details
on the prior admission please see the discharge summary from
[**4-19**].

In the ED, initial vitals were: T 98, HR 70, BP 109/54, RR 20,
SvO2 99% on RA. A code stroke was called due to confusion and
slight assymetry on face. The CCU team and neurology evaluated
the patient and thought consistent with delirium and prior
deficits from CVAs. CT head was done and was negative for acute
intracranial process (on prelim read). CXR with edema but no
infiltrate. UA with many WBCs. Per report looks like pus. He was
given CTX and 1L of NS. Vitals on transfer were: HR 80, BP
99/54, RR 20, SvO2 95% RA. Access: power picc, HD.

Currently, he states that he does not feel well, however, he
cannot describe this further.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Unable to obtain. Patient confused. He denies
any pain or shortness of breath.

MICRO:
Urine ([**4-19**]): NGTD
Blood ([**4-19**] x4): NGTD

STUDIES:
CT Head non-con ([**4-19**]):
INDINGS:  There is no acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or
acute
territorial infarction.  The ventricles and sulci are prominent
consistent
with generalized atrophy.  There is a large area of
encephalomalacia in the right occipital lobe, unchanged from
prior CT.  Old right lenticular lacune is noted.  There is no
fracture.  Again noted are underpneumatized right mastoid air
cells.  The visualized paranasal sinuses, left mastoid air
cells, and middle ear cavities are clear.
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial process.

CXR ([**4-19**]):
IMPRESSION:  Status post extubation.  Findings suggesting mild
pulmonary
edema.  Persistent left basilar opacification, but somewhat
improved.


Brief Hospital Course:
80-year-old male with history of CAD s/p CABG x2, chronic
systolic heart failure with EF of 25%, s/p BiV pacemaker with
very recent admission with cellulitis complicated by renal
failure and HD inititiation, PEA arrest, with resultant short
term memory loss and delirium who presented from rehab with
delirium with concern of sepsis with urinary tract infection. He
continued to decline during his hospitalization with worsening
of his delirium. After discussion with his health care proxy,
the decision was made to transition his care to comfort measures
only, and Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2115-5-1**].

# Altered mental status: There were likely multiple etiologies
including anoxic brain injury, delirium and possible infection.
The anoxic brain injury is not treatable at this time. The
delirium is likely precipitated by his prolonged recent ICU stay
including intubation. We tried to maintain normal sleep/wake
cycle, frequent reorientation, limit tethering. We obtained
blood and urine cultures and started him initially on vancomycin
and ceftriaxone. The cultures were negative for 36 hours at
which time they were discontinued. The patient remained afebrile
during his hospitalization. Head CT and CXR did not show any
acute proscess. There was evidence of old occipital infarcts.
Delirium continued to worsen in the context of hypotension
associated with hemodialysis and then worsening metabolic state
after HD was discontinued. He received Haldol, Ativan, and
olanzapine for agitation, which became more frequent,
particularly at night, over the course of his hospital
admission.
.
# Hypotension: Patient tolerated pressures in the 90s during
hemodialysis, but may have ultimately exacerbated his delirium.
