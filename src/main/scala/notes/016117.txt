History of Present Illness:
76F w hx of CAD s/p CABG [**2174**] (LIMA->LAD), s/p multiple PCIs,
bioprosthetic AVR w/ aortic root repair, s/p BiV PPM, COPD, DM2,
presented to [**Hospital3 10377**] on [**2181-8-18**] with compaints of
increasing dyspnea on exertion and progressive weakness x3-4
weeks.  Also had intermittent non-productive cough, denied
fevers or increased peripheral edema.  In the ED at OSH, she
complained of chest pressure and was noted to have tachycardia.
Chest pressure located on left upper chest in area of pacemaker,
no radiation.  Was watching television at onset, no known
exacerbating or alleviating factors, not associated with
inspiration, did not get worse with walking, +/- was worse with
moving arms.  She was given nitro, asprin, oxygen and morphine.

She continued to have progressive dyspnea and persistent chest
discomfort with a warm/flushed feeling.  Due to concern for
heart failure, she was given IV lasix 100mg and responded well.
There was also concern for rapid afib HR 140s and she was given
diltiazem 15mg IV with improvement of heart rate to 100bpm.
However, her pacemaker was interrogated at Caritas on [**2181-8-20**] by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], and only showed underlying sinus rhythm.
.
She was transferred to the ICU during which time she had SBP
70s, asymptomatic, improved slowly to SBP 100s after stopping
beta blocker and ?lisinopril.  Maintained oxygen with nasal
canula 2-4L, had some tachypneic episodes that responded to
CPAP.
.
Cardiac biomarkers positive at outside hospital, initially with
trop 0.14 and CK-MB of 3.7, placed on heparin drip; trop peaked
at 8.11 on [**2181-8-19**].  TTE showed EF 20-25% with severe global
hypokinesis.
.
At baseline, dyspnea at rest on exertion.  At baseline was able
to climb 3 stairs and walk around house with cane, able to go
out to the restaurant once/week.  Starting 3-4 weeks ago, was
unable to walk up the 3 stairs and could no longer go out,
having trouble walking around her house as well.  + orthopnea.
No PND. No increased peripheral swelling.  No
fevers/chills/rigors.  Intermittent non-productive cough.  New
urinary urgency and incontinence, but no dysuria.  Some nausea
after eating "feels heavy", no vomitting, no change in stool
pattern, no bloody stools.  No leg pain.  No history of stroke,
? TIAs. Currently no CP or palpitations.  Continues to feel SOB
but able to talk in full sentences on 3L.

ECHO [**2181-8-22**] at [**Hospital1 18**]:

The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with severe global hypokinesis. The basal inferolateral
wall contracts best (LVEF = 20-25 %). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.] No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal with borderline normal free wall function. A well-seated
bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type of
prosthesis. There is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area
<0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Critical aortic valve prosthesis stenosis. Left
ventricular cavity enlargement with severe globa hypokinesis.
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2181-1-25**], the aortic valve gradient andf
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension have progressed. Left
ventricular cavity size is slightly larger.
