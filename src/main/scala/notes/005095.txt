Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None this hospitalization


History of Present Illness:
74 year-old woman with afib on coumadin, chronic diastolic CHF,
COPD, and GERD who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] with N/V and was
found to be hypotensive in systolic 80s-90s.
.
Of note, patient was recently hospitalized [**Date range (3) 79471**] to
the cardiology service for afib with rvr associated with ST
depressions, troponin leak, and elevated BNP. She underwent TEE
with cardioversion which was complicated by hypoxia that
resolved with IV lasix drip diuresis. During this admission, she
also had N/V that was felt to be due to digoxin toxicity and
digoxin was discontinued.
.
Since being discharged from the hospital, she states that she
has been doing poorly. She has had ongoing N/V, having
difficulty keeping even water down. Reports pain in
mid-epigastrium. Also reports approximately 3 loose bowel
movements daily, had initially been bloody but not recently. She
carries a diagnosis of colitis, presumably crohn's but has not
followed up with repeat colonoscopy to confirm diagnosis. Feels
that she has lost 20 lbs over several months. She had not been
taking her asacol until recent hospital admission. She was seen
by her gastroenterologist today who noted BP to be 80/60 and
referred her to ED for hypotension and inability to tolerate
po's.
At [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] ED, she was afebrile, HR 60s-90s, SBP 80s-90s,
satting high 90s-100% on 2L. She received 4mg iv zofran, 2mg iv
morphine, 5mg po oxycodone. EKG showed afib wtih ST depressions
diffusely. Trop was elevated to 0.116 (up from 0.07 on last
admission with Cr 1.2-1.5 at that time), Cr 1.38 (up from 0.9 on
discharge [**6-5**]), and Hct 45.6 (up from 35 on discharge [**6-5**]).
Dig level was low. U/A was bland. INR was 3.6. She was guaiac
positive on rectal exam. IV access was difficult; options for
central access were discussed but family declined. She was given
3L NS with little response in blood pressures. CT abdomen
reportedly showed no colitis or ischemic gut; there was some CBD
dilatation 16mm with some intrahepatic ductal dilatation. LFTs
were wnl.

are unchanged. There is minimal pulmonary vascular
re-distribution improved compared to prior. The right lower lobe
opacity has partially cleared. Right middle lobe opacity is also
partially cleared. The old rib fractures and compression
deformities are
again visualized.

Brief Hospital Course:
IMPRESSION: 74F with PMH significant for A.fib (on Coumadin),
chronic diastolic CHF, COPD, GERD who presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**]
with nausea, emesis and was found to be hypotensive which
responded to IV hydration; occurring in the setting of her
chronic diarrhea issues with preliminary diagnosis of
inflammatory colitis.
.
# CHRONIC DIARRHEA COMPLAINTS - The patient has had on-going
complaints of watery, loose and intermittently bloody stools. A
sigmoidoscopy in [**8-/2105**] demonstrated sigmoid colitis with
biopsies noting mild inactive colitis and rare cryptic
abscesses; a sessile serrated adenoma and small internal
hemorrhoids. The patien't diarrhea complaints continued this
admission and she had notably poor PO intake resulting in
dehydration. Gastroenterology consulted and felt colonoscopy and
EGD was warranted, but felt that cardiac optimization would be
necessary before performing this procedure. Stool cultures and
C.diff toxin were reassuring. CMV viral load was pending at
discharge. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis did not demonstrate
evidence of active colitis and Mesalamine was continued in the
meantime. The differential still includes an inflammatory bowel
disorder vs. colonic ischemia. Conservative management was
recommended until an endoscopy can be performed in the future;
in [**5-14**] weeks, once her cardiac issues have stabilized.
.
# HYPOTENSION - Presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] with hypotension
80-90 mmHg which responded to IV fluids. She subsequently
developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in
this setting with resulting EKG findings suggestive of demand
ischemia and a troponin elevation to 0.10 with a flat CK-MB.
This was all improved with hydration, thought to be volume
losses in the setting of her diarrhea and nausea complaints. Her
Lasix was initially hel
