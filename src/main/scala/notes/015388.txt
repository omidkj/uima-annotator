Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with hematemasis and hypotension,
likely variceal bleeding. On arrival to the ICU, his SBP was in
the 90's. An EGD was attempted but blood began to pour out and
the patient's blood pressure dropped and he bcame bradycardic.
They were able to see one varix without at band and a stomach
and esophagus full of blood. He then went into PEA arrest. CPR
initiated. [**State **] tube placed emergently. Surguery was
consulting for emergent TIPS should the patient be stabalized.
He was given ACLS protocol with epinephrine, atropine, calcium,
bicarbonate.  A second central line was placed in the left
femoral vein. His rhythym changed to Vtach, he was defibrillated
and given amiodarone. His rhythm changed to PEA with bradycardia
then deteriorated in to Vfib. Defibrillated again. Then may have
been in Torsades, given Magnesium 2gm. During this time, he was
being given fluids, pRBC's and FFP via rapid infuser. He then
converted to sinus tachycardia with a systolic blood pressure in
the 120's. He was then given further units of blood and normal
saline.  CXR demonstrated appropriate placement on [**State **]
tube. His Bp began trending down. Neo was added to levophed;
then vassopressin and subsequently dopamine. His blood pressure
hovered in the 50/30 range despite four pressors and multiple
units of blood. The cordis became non-functional and was pulled.
He then developed a hematoma at that site. Vascular surgery
recommended compression. His wife ultimately decided not to have
CPR or ACLS medications given should he code again. GI was
contact[**Name (NI) **] again to see if there were any other possible
intervensions, of which there were none possible. pH returned at
7.01; he was given multiple amps of bicarnobate. His blood
pressure continued to drop rapidly, bradycardia  ensued and the
patient passed away with family at his bedside.
