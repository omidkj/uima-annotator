History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 51 year-old man with a history of chronic
hypercapneic respiratory failure s/p trach, COPD, and morbid
obesity who presented from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with hypotension and is
admitted to the MICU for further management.

He was trached on [**2178-8-13**] and last discharged on [**2178-9-18**] for
hypercapneic respiratory failure which was thought to be
secondary to a cuff leak, though he was also treated for
resistant psuedomonas VAP during this admission. He went to
[**Hospital 100**] rehab and completed a course of tobramycin (last dose
?[**2178-9-19**]). He also had blood cx that grew coag negative staph
and was started on vanc on [**9-27**]. He had a leukocytosis, with a
WBC count of 16 that trended down to 6 on the day of admission.
A urine cx grew ESBL klebsiella on [**9-30**] but he was not started
on antibiotics for this for unclear reasons. During this time,
his metoprolol was also increased from 12.5 mg po tid to 25 mg
po tid on [**9-27**] for improved a. fib heart rate control.

On the day of admission, he was found to have a BP of 85/65 ->
60/palp from a baseline in the low 100s systolic after
debridement of a right flank wound. He was thought to be
bacteremic and given approximately 1L IVF bolus with no
response. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

On arrival, VS were 97.8 84 80/47 24 100% on unknown vent
settings. He was thought to be septic vs having beta blocker
toxicity (last metoprolol given at 2 p.m.) and was given zosyn,
1.5 L IVF, and glucagon, with improvement in SBP to 120
transiently after the glucagon. Toxicology was consulted and
felt that beta blocker toxicity was unlikely given absence of
bradycardia.

A right radial a-line and left femoral line were placed for
access. A CXR was performed and demonstrated infiltrate vs
overload. IVFs were held after the CXR, and he was started on
levophed. Per report, a bedside ECHO was also performed to eval
for tamponade but was limited secondary to body habitus.

On the floor, he was minimally responsive to verbal stimuli and
began having rhythmic, tooth clattering motions at the chin. He
was given 1 mg IV ativan x 2 with resolution.

[**2178-10-7**] LE Dopplers:
FINDINGS: Grayscale, color and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral
common femoral, superficial femoral, popliteal and tibial veins
were performed. Note is made that the study is limited by the
patient's body habitus. There is normal low, compression, and
augmentation seen in all of the vessels.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.

[**2178-10-7**] ECHO:
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent
with right ventricular pressure overload. The aortic valve
leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2178-10-2**] CT Head
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, mass
effect, or
vascular territorial infarction. The ventricles and sulci are
normal in size and in configuration. Included osseous structures
are unremarkable, and the visualized paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

[**2178-10-2**] CT CHEST:

Findings: There has seen no interval change in diffuse
paraseptal and
centrilobular emphysematous changes of the lungs which
predominantly affect the apices. Diffuse fibrotic interstitial
abnormality evidenced by
bronchiectasis, bronchiolectasis, ground-glass opacities and
honeycombing
appears unchanged. There is new focus of consolidation within
the left lower lobe. Elevated left hemidiaphragm is unchanged.

No central pathologically enlarged nodes are visualized. No
pleural or
pericardial effusion is seen. The visualized part of the upper
abdomen
including adrenal glands, superior pole of the kidneys, liver,
and spleen
appear unremarkable. Gastrostomy tube is in place.

Ultrasound LEs
CONCLUSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis.

KUB
FINDINGS: A gastric tube is visualized. There is a paucity of
gas is seen in the abdomen. Supine films only were obtained and
therefore I cannot assess for any air-fluid levels.
