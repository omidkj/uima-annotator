Cardiac Cath #1 ([**4-11**]):
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
multivessel disease. The LMCA had a 50% distal lesion. The LAD
had a 99%
lesion in the mid vessel with diffuse 60% proximal and mid
disease. The
LCX had a 70% mid and 80% distal lesion. THe RCA had a 70%
mid-distal
lesion.
2. Hemodynamics post PCI showed mildly elevated right sided
filling
pressures (RA mean 11, RVEDP 14 mm Hg, PASP 30 mm Hg) and mild
to
moderately elevated left sided filling pressures (PCWP 20 mm
Hg). The
cardiac index was low normal at 2.1.
3  Successful stenting of the LAD was performed with a 2.5 x 28
mm
Cypher DES, terminating an acute anterior myocardial infarction.

4. The groin was closed with an Angioseal.

Cardiac Cath #2 ([**4-13**]):
1.  Coronary angiography in this right dominant circulation
demonstrated
two vessel CAD.  The LMCA had mild distal disease and the LAD
stent was
widely patent.  The LCX had a focal 90% lesion at the origin of
two
medium-sized marginals.  The RCA had a tubular lesion in the
mid-portion
up to 90%.
2.  Successful stenting of the LCX was performed with a 2.5 x 23
mm
Cypher DES.
3.  Successful stenting of the RCA was performed with
overlapping 2.5 x
23 mm and 3.0 x 33 mm Cypher DES.

ECHO ([**4-11**]):  The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and  cavity size are normal. There is severe
regional left ventricular systolic  dysfunction with hypokinesis
of the basal half of the inferior septum,  inferior and
inferolateral walls and near akinesis of other segments. The
apex  is mildly dyskinetic. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle.  Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic  valve leaflets appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No  aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no  pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  47 y/o male with dyslipidemia and smoking hx who p/w acute
anterior STEMI, found to have 3VD and LMC dz s/p mid-LAD [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **].

1.  CAD:  Pt diagnosed with acute anterior STEMI at OSH and
transferred for emergent PCI.  He had his prox LAD successfullky
stented terminating the STEMI.  His CK peaked at 1418 and MB at
142.  He was then taken to the CCU where he was monitored.  He
was treated with asa/plavix/beta-blocker/ACE/statin.  He was
then taken back to the cath lab where he had his LCx and RCA
successuflly stented with DES on [**2152-4-13**].  He remained chest pain
free during the hospitalization.  He will be discharged with
asa/plavix/statin/beta-blocker/ace/aldactone.

2.  Pump:  Pt has a severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with EF ~20%.
 This was prior to his second PCI, so I expect some degree of
recovery.  He will require another ECHO in 30 days and if his EF
is < 30%, he will meet MADDIT II criteria and require
prophylactic ICD for primary prevention of SCD.  Currently he is
not volume overloaded and requires no diuretic.  Given his
normal serum K, he will not be discharged with
aldactone/epelrenone (EPHESUS).  He will need his serum K
monitored.

3.  Rhythm:  Pt had 2 episodes of AIVR approx 12 hours after his
STEMI.  Otherwise, he remained in NSR.  He may require an ICD,
as per #2.

3.  Smoking: Pt states he will not smoke anymore (30+ pack year
history).
