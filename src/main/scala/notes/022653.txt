LABORATORY DATA:  Labs on admission revealed the white count
of 16.7, hematocrit of 35.3 and platelet count 385,000.  The
SMA 7 revealed the sodium of 129, potassium 3.6.  The amylase
was 375, alkaline phosphatase 190.  Chest x-ray revealed left
pleural effusion and a question of left lower lobe
infiltrate.  CT scan revealed positive left lower lobe
consolidation.  CTA negative for PE.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2107-12-8**] with
a diagnosis of postoperative pneumonia.  She was started on
Levofloxacin and Vancomycin.  She remained febrile with

for anaerobic coverage.  Angiography was done, which was
negative.

Diet was advanced.  Given her bump in amylase and lipase,
these labs were followed, which alkaline phosphatase
decreased to 95.  The amylase and lipase decreased to 129 and
152.  The patient continued to have a left lower lobe
consolidation.  It was thought that the patient would be
transferred to the floor on hospital day #4.  The patient had
ruled out for a PE and the vital signs had stabilized.  Of
note, the abdominal CT was negative for evidence of
pancreatitis or gallstones.  The amylase and lipase continued
to improve.  She tolerated p.o. diet.

It was felt that her symptoms was consistent with a drug
eruption by her examination.  She was started on
Triamcinolone cream, as well as Sarna.  The rash improved.

On [**2107-12-14**], the patient was discharged home in stable
condition.  It was found that the amylase and lipase
elevations were not pancreatitis, as clinically, the patient
did not have pancreatitis.
