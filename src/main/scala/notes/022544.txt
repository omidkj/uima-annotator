Date of Birth:   [**2121-4-10**]       Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIAC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71 year-old male who
presented to [**Hospital6 3872**] on the [**6-25**]
with acute onset of shortness of breath.  The patient has a
history of an myocardial infarction [**2192-9-21**].  Echocardiogram
at that time revealed aortic stenosis, trace AI.  The patient
underwent a cardiac catheterization, which showed a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 35%, critical aortic
stenosis with aortic valve area of 0.9 cm squared, dilated
aortic root and noncritical lesions of his left main and his
left anterior descending coronary artery.  The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
cardiac surgery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  History of aortic stenosis.  2.
Status post myocardial infarction [**2192-9-21**].  3.  Noninsulin
dependent diabetes mellitus.  4.  Hypertension.  5.  History
of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **].  6.  Status post splenectomy.  7.
Remote smoker.

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:  1.  Hydroxyurea 500 mg po q day.
2.  Toprol XL 150 mg po q day.  3.  Lasix 40 mg po q day.  4.
Digoxin 0.125 mg po q day.  5.  At [**Hospital6 3872**]
the patient had episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and
the patient was placed on Amiodarone 400 mg po t.i.d.

ALLERGIES:  Percocet, codeine, which give him nausea.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.1.  Pulse 62 sinus
rhythm.  Respiratory rate 18.  Blood pressure 106/62.  Oxygen
saturation 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  Weight 109.8
kilograms.  This is a 71 year-old male in no acute distress.
He is alert, oriented, neurologically grossly intact.  Lungs
with bibasilar crackles right greater then left.  Heart
regular rate and rhythm, 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities are warm and well perfuse.  2+ posterior
tibial bilaterally, 1+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.
Examination of his carotid showed a bilateral radiating
murmur.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 29.5, hematocrit
40.8, platelet count 347.  Chem 7 sodium 135, potassium 4.4,
chloride 99, bicarb 25, BUN 13, creatinine 0.9, glucose 121.
The patient has a history of leukocytosis with multiple
documented white blood cell counts at [**Hospital6 3874**] of 29,000.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] for workup for cardiac surgery.
Upon admission the patient was found to have a report of
problem teeth.  The patient had Panorex films ordered and
dental consult was obtained.  Dental consult on [**2192-10-30**]
resulted in the decision that teeth #28 and #29 should be
extracted prior to aortic valve placement.  Oral surgery was
contact[**Name (NI) **] for planned extraction.  The patient was taken to
the Operating Room on [**2192-11-1**] for extraction of teeth #28
and #29.  The patient also underwent hematology workup prior
to surgery for his history of polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] and his
leukocytosis.  Hematology felt that the polycythemia [**Doctor First Name **] was
under good control and the patient was cleared for the
Operating Room.  It was felt that his leukocytosis was due to
his splenectomy and was not a factor in proceeding with
surgery as the peripheral smear showed increased neutrophils.

The patient was taken to the Operating Room with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 70**] on [**2192-11-2**] for an aortic valve replacement with a
25 mm pericardial [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] valve.  Please see
operative note for further details.  The patient was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on Levophed, Milrinone
and Aprotinin.  The patient's first 24 hours in the Intensive
Care Unit was significant for increased chest tube output.
The patient received multiple blood products and transfusions
to control his bleeding in the Operating Room as well as
postoperatively.  The patient was weaned and extubated from
mechanical ventilation on his first postoperative evening.
Milrinone was weaned to off.  The patient's Levophed was
transitioned to neosinephrine, which was gradually weaned to
off over the next several days.  Hemodynamically the patient
remained with an adequate cardiac output greater then 3 with
a low systemic vascular resistance.  The patient required
aggressive pulmonary toilet in the Intensive Care Unit.

On postoperative day number two the patient was noted to have
a white blood cell count of 35.1, which continued to rise
into the 50s over subsequent hospital course.  Hematology
felt that his increasing leukocytosis was due to a
postoperative leukemoid reaction from coronary artery bypass
surgery and was not significant.  His white blood cell
differential was significant for elevated neutrophils without
a bandemia.  Chest tubes were removed on postoperative day
number three.  After his chest tubes were removed it was
noted that the patient had moderate amount of serosanguinous
drainage from the chest tube sites.  Chest x-ray was
obtained, which showed a large cardiac silhouette and small
bilateral pleural effusions.  This was discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 70**] and it was decided to obtain an echocardiogram to
rule out the possibility of tamponade as the patient had a
large amount of bleeding from his chest tube postoperatively.

An echocardiogram was obtained on [**2192-11-6**] postoperative day
number five, which showed severely depressed left ventricular
function, no pericardial effusion, no evidence of tamponade.
Discussion with hematology about the increased drainage from
his chest tube sites resulted in suggestion of holding the
Hydroxyurea until drainage from his chest tube sites
decreased.  Drainage from the chest tube sites subsequently
decreased over the next few days.  The patient was working
with physical therapy.  He was able to ambulate approximately
100 feet using a walker for assistance.  The patient was
screened by rehabilitation facility and was cleared for
discharge to a rehabilitation facility on postoperative day
number eight.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Temperature max 98.2.  Pulse 75
sinus rhythm.  Blood pressure 101/64.  Respiratory rate 18.
Room air oxygen saturation 95%.  Weight 116 kilograms, which
is 7 kilograms up from his preoperative weight.  On
examination the patient is awake, alert and oriented times
three.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm.  Positive rub, no
audible murmur.  Breath sounds are decreased at bilateral
bases.  No rhonchi, rales or wheezes are present.  Abdomen is
large, soft, positive bowel sounds, nontender, nondistended.
Lower extremities are well and well profused with 1 to 2+
edema distally.  Sternal incision is without erythema.  There
is a small amount of serosanguinous drainage from the
superior portion of the sternal incision.  Sternum is stable.
There is a small to moderate amount of serosanguinous
drainage from the chest tube site.

LABORATORY DATA FROM [**2192-11-9**]:  CBC, white blood cell count is
pending.  Previous white blood cell count from [**2192-11-7**] was
50, hematocrit 29.6, platelet count is pending.  PT 13.5, PTT
27.6.  Chem 7, sodium 132, potassium 4.6, chloride 100,
bicarb 26, BUN 21, creatinine 1.0, glucose 141.  Chest x-ray
from [**2192-11-6**] shows cardiomegaly, small bilateral pleural
effusions unchanged from x-ray of [**2192-11-5**].  Sputum culture
[**2192-11-4**] showed mixed oral pharyngeal flora.  Urine culture
from [**2192-11-4**] was sterile.
