History of Present Illness:
This is a 88 yo Russian-speaking F PMH of COPD, CHF, DVT/PE p/w
acute hypoxia and agitation at o/p V/Q scan [**10-30**]. Sent by PCP
with hypoxia/SOB and chest pain of a couple days duration. Sats
to 50s, NRB --> 100. Unable to complete V/Q. From Heb Reb, had
increased WOB x few days per daughter. ?Recent d/c coumadin,
decreased lasix dose.
.
In the ED: Temp: 101.0, BP:107/70, HR:87, RR: 18, O2sat:79% but
92% ventimask. Was on CPAP briefly. CXR with RLL lg infiltrate.
Given levaquin 750 mg po X 1 (as didn't have a line initially).
ABG: 7.39/79/198 on 100% NRB. Femoral line for blood, access.
.
To the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. [**10-31**] to be breathing comfortably. But began moaning
on being awakened. Confused at first, but with translator more
oriented. In the [**Name (NI) 153**] pt was diuresed with iv lasix.
levofloxacin was started for a question of pneumonia. Vanco was
started for [**1-27**] bottle grew coag neg staph no complete
speciation yet. Heparin bridging and coumadin were started for
afib. her o2 requirement. Diuresed 1.5-2 liters daily. 5th PICC
line placed. 6th Fem line removed with Enterococcus and coag -
staph. Pt started on Vancomycin. transferred to the floor [**11-1**].

.
On the floor increased metoprolol for atrial
fibrillation/flutter. Diuresed 3 pounds over one day as per
report. Respiratory status noted at 24-30 for 24 hrs. Shallow
breaths, increased somnolence. ABG 2 hrs prior 7.32/91/69.
Attempted diuresis with 40 IV lasix and then 20 IV lasix, nebs
but given concern for hypercarbic respiratory failure, decision
to transfer back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] currently pt alert oriented x1 at baseline, sleepy
but at baseline as per staff. Repeat gas prior to hitting floor
slightly improved at 7.33/82/78. pt complaining of abdominal
pain. With interpreter on phone reports "I was short of breath
before, now Im better." Pt tachypneic to 30 with conversation.
.
ROS: abdominal pain. reports she had chest pain several days
ago, and it is resolved. Reports she was short of breath several
hours ago, but she is currently back to baseline.

Pertinent Results:
[**11-2**]
4 PM 7.33/82/78
1 PM 7.32/91/69
.
EKG [**11-2**]: Pending
EKG [**11-1**]: irreg, nl axis, + LVH, LBBB, intermittently A-paced
.
Radiologic Data:
.
[**11-2**] CXR cardiomegaly, pulm edema with alveolar edema, bilateral
edema, slightly worse than prior chest x-ray
.
[**2189-10-30**] CXR
A single lateral view of the chest was obtained. A dual-lead
pacemaker is present. The patient's PICC line terminates in the
region of the right atrium in the lateral projection. There is
blunting of both costophrenic angles, suggestive of bilateral
pleural effusions. Pulmonary edema is better visualized on prior
frontal radiographs. Calcified hilar lymph nodes are present.
There is generalized osteopenia and multilevel degenerative
change. There is vertebral body height loss of approximately
three vertebral bodies at the thoracolumbar junction and likely
of one in the upper thorax as
well, of indeterminate age.
.
[**10-29**] CXR: Bilateral pleural effusions, cardiomegaly, + pulmonary
edema, ? RLL infiltrate
.
[**2189-10-30**] TTE
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF 60%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion
.
CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis ([**11-2**]):
IMPRESSION:
1.  Fat containing umbilical hernia with a 2 cm neck at its
superior portion. There is no bowel within this hernia and no
evidence of obstruction.
2.  Pulmonary edema, and moderate right and small left pleural
effusions.
3.  Multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, which may relate
to the
patient's CHF, however, should be followed closely as the
patient has a
history of mastectomy in [**2175**].
4.  Soft tissue opacity within the trachea, which may represent
secretions; however, a mass cannot be excluded.  Short interval
followup is recommended following treatment to assess for
persistence of this lesion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 88 yo Russian-speaking F PMH of COPD, CHF,
DVT/PE initially presented with acute hypoxia and agitation
thought related to CHF, [**Hospital 2182**] transferred from floor with
hypercarbic respiratory failure.
.
#)Congestive Heart Failure - The patient was admitted to the
intensive care unit with hypoxia and hypercarbic respiratory
distress, which appeared to be predominantly as a result of CHF
and pulmonary edema. Exam and imaging were consistent with
pulmonary edema; chest CT showed bilateral pleural effusions R >
L. She was treated initially with a heparin drip for concern for
pulmonary embolism given history and was then bridged to
Coumadin. The patient was treated initially with levofloxacin
for empiric coverage for pneumonia and was completed on a 7 day
course though had no further evidence of fever or leukocytosis
during her hospital stay.  She did have a non-productive cough.
She was treated with aggressive diuresis, frequent nebs, and was
transferred to the floor.  She was transerred back to the ICU
for hypercarbic respiratory distress and was started on a Lasix
drip for approx 24 hours.  She received approx 80mg IV of Lasix
at that time and was 2.4L negative in 24
