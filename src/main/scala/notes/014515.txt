Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: Middle aged spanish speaking male, brought into OSH by EMS
for respiratory distress, intubated, and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for ICU care.

.
# Respiratory failure: OSH ABG with hypercarbia/respiratory
acidosis (w/ metabolic compensation); this was on FiO2 100%:
unclear if patient also hypoxic prior to intubation.
Differential includes CHF exacerbation, flash pulmonary edema
from tachyarrythmia, pneumonia, or COPD exacerbation. Patient
had growing infiltrate on CXR, in addition to signs of pulmonary
edema. CT scan from  [**1-12**] showed RML ground glass and RLL
collapse.  CTA negative for PE. Echo reports showing diastolic
CHF with LVEF 75% and concentric LVH. Oxygen saturations have
improved with diuresis, however patient has also become
hypotensive after diuresis preventing weaning from ent. Blood,
urine, and sputum culture data, including PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] all been
negative, and the patient completed a course of broad spectrum
antibiotics for community acquired and vent associated
pneumonia. In addition, the patient was continued on combivent
inhaler for his COPD.   The patient underwent daily pressure
support breathing trials in an attempt to wean him off the vent,
however these trials were complicated by hypertension and
occasional hypotension secondary to diuresis.  Patient was
successfully extubated on [**1-18**] and weaned off to NC with chest
OT, incentive spirometry.  He remained stable after this and at
the time of discharge did not require supplemental oxygen, and
appeared at his baseline per his family.
.
# Hypotension/Shock on admission: Initially thought to be
hypovolemic on presentation, given that he was diuresed at the
outside hospital prior to transfer. Soon after admission he
required IVF and dopamine to maintain BP. After dopamine drip
patient developed narrow complex SVT with hypotension. Dopamine
was discontinued and patient was placed on neosynephrine and
vasopressin. Vagal maneuvers failed to slow his SVT. Adenosine
was next used and the patient developed V-Tach vs. V-paced
rhythm. Amiodarone 300mg was given and pressures stabilized
while on two pressors.  The following morning his pressors were
discontinued and he maintained his systolic blood pressure in
the 100-110 range. Differential for hypotension included
hypovolemia, septic shock, tachyarrythmia.  His blood pressure
remained stable, and at the time of discharge, his
antihypertensives were resumed.
.
#Identity: The identity of the patient was unknown for three
days. on the third hospital day electrophysiology interrogated
his pacer and used the serial number [**Serial Number 75795**].
With this information the team was able to track down old
hospital records from [**Hospital6 **] to learn that the
patient has a history of CHF, COPD, HIV, and Latent syphillis.
.
#Fever/Hypotension: The patient developed fever and hypotension
on [**1-15**] after diuresis. His BP responded with Fluid
administration. He was concurrently on broad spectrum
antibiotics for vent associated pneumonia during the fevee.
Cultures were sent. [**Last Name (un) **] stim was negative. The following day
suspicion was raised that OG tube feeds were draining into his
lung, as thick secretions wer
