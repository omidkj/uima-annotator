History of Present Illness:
77 yo M with history of coronary artery disease s/p CABG [**2116**],
PCI native left circumflex [**2124**], systolic heart failure, and
multiple sclerosis, presents with melena from [**Hospital3 **]. Of note, patient had a recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] from
[**2126-9-2**] to [**2126-9-4**] for elective ERCP during which he had
removal of CBD stones as well as a biliary stent placed. That
hospital course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with RVR.
He then presented on [**2126-11-19**] to [**Hospital6 5016**] for
additional ERCP to have his previously placed biliary stent
removed. At time of that procedure, [**Hospital3 **] ERCP team
reported some [**Hospital3 **] from around the stent at the ampulla, which
they cauterized to gain hemostasis. Patient was discharged from
[**Hospital3 **] and reports that he was not feeling like he ws back
to his baseline at any point in [**Month (only) 1096**]. This morning at 0600,
he awoke with severe mid-abdominal pain and then had urgency to
have bowel movement, which was described as "mahagony-colored".
He then proceeded to Holy [**Hospital 81777**] hospital, where he received
one unit of [**Hospital **] and ~1 L IVF. Due to poor respiratory status,
he received furosemide. He was then urgently transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for suspected upper GI bleed related to his history of
multiple ERCPs.
.
Of note, patient has had upper respiratory sypmtoms for the last
3 to 4 weeks and presented to his primary care physician several
days prior to coming in for his acute complaint at this
admission. He was prescribed an antibiotic of which he does not
recall the name. Regardless, he never filled the prescription.
He notes his breathing is a bit labored and though denies acute
complaints, later admits that he has had increased cough and
sputum production in last week.
.
Vitals upon presentation to the ED were: T 98, HR 120, BP
100/74, RR 16, O2Sat 100% on NRB. Once arriving at [**Hospital1 18**], ED
obtained NG lavage, which failed to clear of [**Hospital1 **] and noted
large amounts of melena. Additionally, U/A which showed moderate
bacteria and positive nitrite, but was without WBCs. Urine
culture and [**Hospital1 **] cultures are pending. Patient was given
pantoprazole IV as only medical intervention. Patient was
maintained on a non-rebreather throughout his stay in the ED and
sats were 100%. He was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with
RVR and HR was in the 110s to 120s throughout his ED stay with
no intervention performed. GI, hepatology, and ERCP were
consulted. GI attending in ED felt that source of bleed was
likely to be sphincterotomy site as patient had an ERCP in
[**8-/2126**], which was complicated by ulcerative bleed around stent.
Surgery deferred managment decisions to GI and ERCP team.
Patient was then transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] prior to signout of the
patient to the admitting medicine ICU team due to need for
emergent ERCP.
.
Patient originally came to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and went urgently to ERCP, where
was quickly noted to be exanguinating from duodenum, though
bleeding was too brisk to localize further as several units of
[**Hospital Unit Name **] were reported to be seen in stomach as well as in the
small bowel. ERCP was aborted and trauma line was plaed by
anesthesia in ERCP suite prior to patient being transferred back
to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for stabilization. Massive transfusion protocol was
activated and paitent was transfused 5 units PRBC and 2 units
FFP prior to transfer to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] MICU [**Location (un) 2452**] for
stabilization prior to IR attempted angio and embolization.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo M with history of coronary artery disease s/p CABG [**2116**],
PCI native left circumflex [**2124**], systolic heart failure, and
multiple sclerosis, presented with melena from [**Hospital3 **]. Found to be having massive upper GI bleed as well as
cholangitis and pneumonia. Suspected source of bleeding was from
recent biliary stenting where he had bled in the past. He
urgently went to ERCP where he was seen to be bleeding near the
duodenal papilla at the site of a prior spincterotomy and bleed.
Sclerosis and ligation were unsuccessful at ERCP. IR was called
and he went to angio. At angio the gastroduodenal artery was
identified as the bleeding source. Embolization was
unsuccessful. Surgery was following throughout. After IR could
not embolize the source of bleeding, surgery was urgently called
to the bedside. Surgery felt the patient was an extremely high
operative risk given his CHF, PNA, Afib, MS, and cholangitis on
top of his GI bleed. His wife was [**Name (NI) 653**] by surgery and she
agreed to d
