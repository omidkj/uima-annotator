with dyspnea and stridor.  She states that today after walking

She reports two sick contacts who live in her dorm. Of note, she
has three recent [**Hospital1 18**] admissions (most recent [**12-23**], [**11-22**],
[**10-23**]) for paradoxical vocal cord movement vs asthma flare
requiring intubation during two of them. During her last
admission, she was not intubated and she was noted to respond
well to prn ativan.
.
In the ED, she had a RR in the 30's, and she received albuterol
nebs, heliox, and 3mg ativan.  Her O2 sats remained 98-100%. She
was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for continued monitoring.
.
In the [**Name (NI) 153**], pt is satting well on 35% O2 and reports that she
feels better with no more chest tightness.  She continues to

Brief Hospital Course:
19 yo female with hx of question of asthma with many
exacerbations, vocal cord dysfunction, depression, and
conversion disorder presents with stridor and tachypnea.
.
# dyspnea and stridor: this is typical of her previous ? asthma
exacerbations, for which she does not appear to have a
definitive diagnosis. She received ativan, heliox, and nebs in
the ED with some resolution of symptoms. Although she has a
question of airway disease and a diagnosis of vocal cord
dysfuction, this is most likely a manifestation of her
conversion disorder. CXR appears normal and unchanged. Most
recent admission reported good response to ativan. She continues
to sat well in the upper 90s. She will likely benefit most from
consistent social and outpatient medical support to help her
more effectively deal with anxieties and avoid the ED/ICU where
iatrogenic harm may come to her. She has seen ENT before.  She
was given ativan prn, reassurance, and her inhalers were
continued.  A coordinated attempt improve her support structure
was already in development, but further impetus was placed by
emails and phone calls to her major sources of health care
support - her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 19039**] and [**University/College 3036**].  Will
discuss with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 19039**], and [**University/College 68304**]:
coordination of care.  Follow up appointments are set up [**University/College 68305**]health services on [**12-31**] at 9 am.  They agreed to
set up support services necessary to her after the visit
tomorrow. Will encourage her to follow up with
speech/swallow/behavioral therapy as outpatient
.
# conversion disorder: previously diagnosed at [**Hospital1 2025**]. As above,
this is likely the root cause of her exacerbations and would
benefit from greater outpatient and social support.

currently treated.
Possible [**Hospital1 18**] or [**University/College **]psychiatric referal after
appointments at [**University/College **]and/or PCP.
