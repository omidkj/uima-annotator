Intubation/extubation with invasive ventilation


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 16490**] is a 69 yo with IDDM, PVD, CVA [**2138**] (no residual
deficits), ESRD [**1-9**] ([**3-12**]) DM, not on HD, with a h/o of multiple
episodes of hypoglycemia taken emergently to OSH after this wife
found him unresponsive in bed, surrounded by empty coke cans.
Blood glucose was 6. [**Name (NI) 1094**] wife states that the patient has not
been feeling well for the last couple of days prior to event,
having increased [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 1658**] colored, foul smelling diarrhea. Pt
denieed fevers, chills, abdominal pain, but has not been eating
well. Wife reports more incontinence. Patient has had DM for
decades and is on NPH and regular insulin followed by [**Last Name (un) **].
Worsening renal fx reportely over the past year, with multiple
discussions with his nephrologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 805**] about initiation
of HD. Yesterday AM, the patient was more confused, reportedly,
then was found unresponsive by his wife. with a BG of 6. Pt was
given 1 amp of dextrose in the field. The patient reportedly did
not fall, and did not complain of any CP, SOB, dizziness,
lightheadedness or diaphoresis. He does not remember feeling
shaky before the episode.
.
Pt was taken to OSH emergently, was intubated in the field.
Prior to intubation, the patient apparently vomited and
aspirated a large amount of particulate matter (witnessed by
paramedics). Particulate matter was aspirated from his ETT. When
brought to the ED, the patient was not responding to any
commands. Head CT was done at OSH was reportedly negative,
showing an old infarct, but no acute process. Blood sugar was
reportedly in the 20s. Laboratory studies revealed an non-AG
metabolic acidosis, renal insufficiency but normal lactate
levels. Per OSH records, the patient had a transient episode of
hypotension of unkown etioology, but rebounded back quickly with
500ccs bolus. Per the patient's wife, the patient did administer
his NPH this AM. Patient with h/o DM and found unresponsive with
significant hypoglycemia. Intubated for airway protection but
not waking up (Etomidate, Ativan given). Exam shows brainstem
function (gag) but not much else. Paitent HD stable, on vent. To
come TO [**Hospital1 18**] tonight to MICU green as patient is usually cared
for at [**Hospital1 18**] for DM and renal failure.
.
Prior to xfer from OSH, received a call from [**Name8 (MD) 16491**] MD
reporting that the patient was becoming more awake, following
commands. Pt unlikely able to protect airway, so kept intubated
and xferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  In the MICU, he became more awake, but
continued to have problems with aspiration.  CXR noted bilateral
effusions and infiltrates c/w aspiration PNA.

smokes 1ppd. Remote heavy EtOH use in past (3+ drinks per day),
quit 2-3 years ago. No recreational drug use. Used to work in
greenhouse supply business, then sold real estate now disabled.

Family History:
Mother colon cancer. Father with throat cancer. Brother died of
colon cancer at age 62.


Physical Exam:
Vitals: Tmin 95.7; Tc95.7, HR 50-61; BP 123-182/49-57; RR 16 on
AC 550x16; FIO2 of 0.5; PEEP 5.
Gen: chronically ill appearing, somnolent elderly male,
intubated, sedated.
HEENT: pupils irregular, assymetric and non-reactive; EOMI, b/l

periorbital edema, MM dry
Neck: supple, no LAD, no JVP elevation, +linear well-healed scar

over Right cartoid
Cardio: PMI inferiorly displaced and diffuse, RRR, nl S1/S2,
no murmurs or rubs appreciated
Resp: CTAB, no exp wheezes
Abd: + BS, soft/NT/ND, no HSM, no masses
Ext: no c/c/e; b/l LE w/ significant atrophy. multiple scars.
dopplerable pulses bilat.
Neuro: intubated, sedated on boluses, but responding to commands
when waking up


Pertinent Results:
[**2150-6-23**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Right bundle-branch block. Left
axis deviation. Left anterior fascicular block. Compared to
previous tracing of [**2150-4-2**] heart rate is increased. Otherwise,
multiple abnormalities as previously noted persist without major
change.
.
[**2150-6-22**] CXRAY: Right internal jugular vascular catheter
terminates in the proximal superior vena cava.  Cardiac contour
and vascular pedicle width have slightly increased and are
accompanied by worsening vascular engorgement, diffuse perihilar
haziness and interstitial opacities, likely due to increased
volume status and fluid overload.  Superimposed secondary
process such as aspiration is difficult to exclude in the
setting of diffuse edema.  Bilateral layering pleural effusions
are noted.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 69M,ESRD, CAD, PVD, brittle type I DM with very labile
sugars taken emergently to OSH after being found unresponsive by
his wife with a blood glucose of 6.
.
1) Hypoglycemia: This was likely the effect of NPH, lantus with
decreased clearance (worsening renal fx, decrease PO intake and
increased diarrhea). Pt has had very labile blood sugars in the
past, with multiple episodes of hypoglycemia. Patient taking
NPH/regular [**9-10**] at home in AM.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] notes, the patient
takes lantus as well.  Patient was initially maintained on an
insulin drip whiel in the ICU, but later transitioned to Lantus
4 units with RISS coverage at meal time.
.
2) Respiratory failure:  Patient was intubated for airway
protection in the field, with visible aspiration and suctioning
back of particular matter.  He was extubated following transfer
to [**Hospital1 18**].  He was started on levofloxacin and flagyl as empiric
therapy for aspiration pneumonia.
.
3) PVD: Patient has known severe peripheral vascular disease,
s/p multiple bypass surgeries and vein harvesting. Patient is
due back fro R SFA angioplasty some time soon to save the
patient's right leg. There has to be a discussion between renal
and vascular surgery about risk of contrast dye and the risk of
starting the pt on HD.
He was continued on Aspirin, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] made aware of
admission.
.
4) Diabetes mellitus, type I: Patient has exocrine and endocrine
pancreatic insufficiency given type I DM, presenting with
[**Male First Name (un) 1658**]-colored stools. He was continued on pancreatic replacement
enzymes.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and patinet was maintained on a
regimen of Lantus 4 units + RISS.
.
5) Renal Insufficiency:  Mild acute on chronic at time of
presentation, likely prerenal in the setting of poor PO intake.
Creatinine returned to baseline  of ~4 with hydration.  Planning
is in progress for eventual hemodialysis. Renal function is
likely
