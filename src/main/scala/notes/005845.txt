History of Present Illness:
39 yo F w/ HIV/AIDS (CD4 331), HCV, DMII, HTN, bipolar disorder,
presents from [**Hospital **] clinic with fever to 100.4 and LE cellulitis.
Pt. reports she was at [**Hospital **] hospital for cellulitis where she
was started on vancomycin. She had initially presented with
bilateral burning leg pain and erythema. She reported
dry-cracked, bleeding skin over the past 1 month. She received 4
days of vancomycin prior to discharge and reported improvement
in her legs. She was d/c'd from [**Hospital1 **] on Sunday night w/o abx,
to attend her [**Hospital **] clinic appointment at [**Hospital1 18**]. At the [**Hospital **] clinic
she had a fever of 100.4. Her legs were noted to be warm and
edematous. She was sent to the ED for further workup of fever
and cellulitis.
In the ED her initial vitals were: 99.4, 85, 96/54, 20, 86RA.
For her hypoxia, she was placed on 4L NC with improvement of 02
sats to only 90%. Her ABG was 7.42/55/46. Blood cx. were drawn
and she was given 1g of IV vanco, tylenol 1gm, bactrim 600mg iv
(PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]), morphine 4mg x1, prednisone 40mg po x1 (for ?PCP w/
Pa02<70). She was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hypoxia and
cellulitis.

CXR [**11-19**] -  No evidence of acute intrathoracic process;
specifically, no evidence of focal pneumonia or congestive heart
failure.

CTA [**11-20**] - Markedly limited and poor inspiration
No saddle PE.
Cardiomegaly. Enlarged pulmonary artery suggestive of pulmonary
artery hypertension.

Old rib fractures

Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is right-to-left
passage of microbubbles across the interatrial septum at rest
c/w a secundum type atrial septal defect. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The estimated cardiac index is
borderline low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2). The right ventricular cavity
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Right-to-left passage of
microbubbles after intravenous injection c/w atrial septal
defect. Low normal left ventricular systolic function. Right
ventricular cavity enlargement.


Brief Hospital Course:
39 yo F w h/o HIV/AIDS, HCV, DMII, HTN, chronic pain, h/o IVDU
on methadone, presents with fever, hypoxia, cellulitis.

1. Hypoxia: Pt. stateed on admission that she chronically has
poor 02 sats and has refused oxygen supplementation and Bipap
for OSA in the past. Her CXR showed no acute process. Her
initial ABG indicated hypercarbia and hypoxemia. Her ABG on
presentation to the ICU was still significant for hypercarbia,
but with a improvement in hypoxemia. She remained asymptomatic
throughout. Due to the pts. HIV hx, there was a suspicion of PCP
(tachypnea, hypoxia, fevers). She did have a h/o PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
her latest CD4 count was >300 and she maintained compliance with
her PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **], which made that diagnosis less likely.  She was
given a dose of bactrim for empiric therapy and steroids in the
ED. Diff. for hypoxia also included pneumonia (CAP), narcotic-
induced, obesity hypoventilation.  Pt had an A-a gradient of >30
so it was felt that this could not [**Last Name (un) 7245**] be attributed to
hypoventilation alone. A PE was ruled out by CT-PA.  An TTE with
bubble study was obtained which did show evidence of an atrial
septal defect.  This was discussed with the cardiology consult
team and it was felt that this was most likely a congenital
defect and not solely responsible for the patient's hypoxia.
The patient adamantly requested discharge, refused to wear
oxygen while in house and refused bipap for her OSA.  An
appointment was made for her to follow up with cardiology in the
future to evalutate for her newly diagnosed ASD.

2.  chronic pain: the patient is on a significant amt of
methadone and oxycodone. She has been seen by pain service and
is on a home regimen as above.
She was continued on her prior regimen and given scripts that
would cover her until her follow up in [**Hospital **] clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

3. HIV: pt is followed here by ID. Her last CD4 count on
[**2140-11-14**] was 331. Her viral load on [**2140-11-14**] was undetectable.
Current CD4 count 245.  She was continued on her
home regimen.

4. Cellulitis: pt. was treated at [**Hospital **] hosp with vanc x 4days
for presumed cellulitis, however, she was left to attend her [**Hospital **]
clinic appt. and was not d/c'd on abx. She had a slight fever
and no leukocytosis and the patient's regular ID attending came
to evaluate her and stateed that she felt the LE's looked the
same or better than baseline and that further antibiotics were
not warranted.  Her coverage was stopped and the patient
remained afebrile for the rest of the hospitalization.

5. DMII- continued home meds however metformin was held for 48
hours following contrast for CT and restarted on discharge.
.
6. lower extremity edema: patient was continued on lasix 20mg
qday.

7.  UTI--A UA was obtained upon transfer to the floor and the
patient was found to have a UTI.  She was placed on cipro for 3
days.  The urine culture showed only fecal contaminant.
