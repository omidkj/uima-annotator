Service:  NSU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61-year-old
woman transferred from [**Hospital 4415**] on [**6-30**]
for a subarachnoid hemorrhage.  The patient was at home on
her couch taking a nap, and her husband heard strange noises,
and the family dog was barking at Mrs. [**Known lastname 12330**].  Her
husband noted the described tonic-clonic seizure, and he
called 911.  She was intubated and transported to [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital, and then there she was unresponsive.  Her pupils
were 4 mm and sluggishly reactive.  She had decorticate
posturing in both upper extremities, and she was transferred
to [**Hospital 4415**] after a CT showed the
subarachnoid hemorrhage with blood in all ventricles.  She
had a ventriculostomy drain placed, and a CTA was obtained
which showed a left posterior communicating artery aneurysm
and a right ICA bifurcation aneurysm, and she was transferred
to [**Hospital6 256**] for further
endovascular treatment.  She also had an MI while at [**Hospital 14852**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Emphysema and COPD.

Chronic hypotension.

Hyperlipidemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Hysterectomy.

ALLERGIES:  No known allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature 100.4, heart rate 85, BP 112/60.
Her ICP was 7 on admission.  HEENT:  Her pupils were 4 down
to 2 mm.  Respiratory wise, she was intubated with
rhonchorous breath sounds.  Cardiac showed an irregular
systolic murmur III/VI.  Abdomen was soft, nondistended, with
hypoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No edema.
Neurologically, she was intubated.  Pupils were 4 down to 2
mm.  She localized briskly with the upper extremities.
Slight withdrawal on the lower's.  Her toes were downgoing.
She had a positive gag and cough.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 9224**] service and
admitted to the ICU for close neurologic observation.  On
[**7-1**], she went to arteriogram.  Arteriogram showed a right
ICA bifurcation aneurysm and a left fetal PCA aneurysm which
was coiled.  There was minimal flow at the end of the case,
and there were no complications during the procedure.  The
patient had minimal EBL and was transported back to the ICU
for close neurologic observation.

On [**7-2**], she had an echo which showed severe global left
ventricular hypokinesis and left ventricular systolic wall
motion which was severely depressed, with 2 plus aortic
regurgitation.  She had coiling done of the left fetal PCA,
and the right ICA bifurcation aneurysm was not treated.  She,
neurologically, was sedated on propofol.  She did not follow
commands.  She withdrew to noxious stimulation applied to her
nailbeds by withdrawing all 4 extremities.  She was unable to
open her eyes.  Her pupils were asymmetric and reactive.  Her
vent drain was leveled at 20 cm above the tragus.

She had an head CT on [**2132-7-2**] which showed no new
bleeding, shift, or hydrocephalus.  Cardiology was consulted.
The patient had positive troponin.  On [**7-1**], it was 0.61,
[**7-2**] it was 0.38 and 0.25.  Cardiology was consulted, and
results of the echo showed severe stress, most likely
metabolic stress, and likely to be from severe CAD.  Her EKG
was without ischemic changes that are diagnostic, and her
CPK's were elevated but negative for an MI.  The patient was
continued to be followed by cardiology.

On [**7-3**], the patient was taken back to angio for diagnostic
exam which showed no evidence of flow through the aneurysm
and no vasospasm.  This was due to an acute change in her
mental status where her pupils became fixed and dilated.
There were no new changes on her head CT, and as previously
mentioned, her angio showed no evidence of vasospasm.  Her
chest x-ray showed bilateral pleural effusions and patchy
infiltrates mostly consistent with the beginning of ARDS.
The patient continued to remain on propofol with light
sedation, with good strong gag reflex, pupils equal, round
and reactive to light on the [**7-4**].  She did have
withdrawal to pain in all 4 extremities.

On [**2132-7-5**], the patient developed thrombocytopenia, and
the hematology service was consulted.  On [**2132-7-7**], the
patient went into A-flutter and converted to normal sinus
rhythm on amiodarone, and continued on Levophed for her blood
pressure.  Her HIT antibody was negative, and her
thrombocytopenia was felt to be multifactorial.  All
medications contributing to that were discontinued, and the
patient's platelet count stabilized.  On [**7-7**], the patient
had another angiogram which showed no evidence of vasospasm,
and stable appearance of coil aneurysm, continued to have
elevated ICP's at 30-35 range, and attempted to placed an EVD
drain.  Head CT post attempt showed no evidence of
hemorrhage.

On [**7-9**], the patient continued to have problems with atrial
fibrillation and was cardioverted x 2 and reloaded with
amiodarone.  On [**7-9**], the patient continued to have problems
with thrombocytopenia with a platelet count done of 47, was
transfused, and repeat was 108.  Etiology was still unclear,
and the patient had all medications that could contribute to
it DC'd.  On [**7-9**], there was a head CT that showed a new 1
cm bleed in the posterior limb of the left internal capsule.
No further treatment for that was necessary.

Neurologically, on the 12 the patient was not following
commands, and tended to localize in the left upper extremity,
continued withdrawing her lower extremities.  Continued on
cefazolin for antibiotic coverage for the drain.  Head CT
done on the 12 showed no change.  The patient had lower
extremity Dopplers done on [**7-10**] that were negative for DVT.

On [**7-12**], the patient had an IVC filter placed to prevent
blood clots.  On [**7-12**], the right pupil was 2.5 down to 2 and
turned head toward stimulation.  The patient had trace
movement of both upper extremities and triple-flexion in the
lower extremities to stimulation.  The patient had a head CT
on [**7-14**] that showed no new changes, and drain continued to
be in place and leveled at 10 cm above the tragus.  She was
opening her eyes to stimulation.  Pupils were 4 mm and trace
reactive.  There was slight movement of bilateral upper
extremities and minimal movement and withdrawal in the lower
extremities to stimulation.

The patient's thrombocytopenia slowly resolved.  No
definitive cause was ever determined, and the patient's
platelet count remained stable.

On [**7-20**], the patient opened her eyes, attempted to follow
commands in her upper extremities, wiggling her toes.  Her
drain was leveled at 20 cm above the tragus.  The patient had
a head CT on [**7-22**] which showed mild increase in the size of
the lateral and third ventricles compared to previous.  She
had a right upper quadrant ultrasound that was within normal
limits.  The vent drain was removed on [**2132-7-22**].  The
patient tolerated that well and was transferred to the
regular floor on [**2132-7-26**].  She remained neurologically
improved, awake, alert and oriented x 1, following commands,
out-of-bed, ambulating with physical therapy.

The patient had a swallow eval done on [**2132-7-28**] in which
she did have some problems with aspiration.  She could have
PO diet consistency of honey thick liquids, pureed solids,
and meds via her G-tube at this time, and she would have a
follow-up speech and swallow eval done at rehab for Passy-
Muir valve and swallowing.  She remained in stable condition
and transferred to rehab with follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] in 1
month with repeat head CT.
