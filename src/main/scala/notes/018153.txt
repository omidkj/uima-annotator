Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left Subclavian line
Left Arterial LIne


History of Present Illness:
82 yr old female w/hx of gout, CAD s/p PCTA of in-stent
restenosis of prox LAD lesion [**2134-4-26**], diastolic dyfunction, AF
s/p successful DCCV [**4-18**] on amidoronone, who has been admitted
twice last month for CHF exac.  At [**Hospital 100**] rehab, pt was noted to
be short of breath with increased orthopnea. Initial story was
that pt was given fluid bolus as well as signficant amount of
fluid via heparin bolus, as precipitant for heart failure.
[**Hospital 100**] rehab physician denies this.   Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
eval.  Also, was being bridged on heparin and coumadin for
recent AF.  PTT >200 and INR >10 at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, so she was
given PO and IV vit K.  In the ED, given 2mg IV morphine, lasix
80mg IV X 1, and ntg gtt started.  Given her resp distress she
was also started on BiPAP 10/10.  Pt's BP dropped from SBP 180's
to 80's.  She remained assymptomatic during this episode.
Febrile to 101 on admission.  NTG stopped, and BiPAP stopped.
She was taken to the CCU.  Of note, she c/o abd pain that lasted
~30 minutes, relieved with defecation.  No bloody diarrhea or
persistent belly pain.

EKG: Sinus rhythm
[**Month (only) 116**] be Normal ECG but baseline artifact makes assessment
difficult
Since previous tracing of [**2134-4-29**], prolonged Q-Tc interval and T
wave changes absent
.
ECHO ([**5-3**]):  The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left  ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size and systolic function  (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal.  The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild to moderate
aortic valve stenosis (area 1.1 and grad 24, mean) . Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve  leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate
(2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly  thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is  a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 y/o female with PMH CAD (s/p recent PCI), diastolic
dysfunction, AS, AF (s/p cardioversion, on amiodarone) admit
w/acute decompensated CHF.
.
1.  Hypotension/Hypertension:  Developed hypotension the ED,
requiring admission to CCU,likely secondary to overaggressive
preload inhibition in setting of moderate AS and increased
atenolol levels in setting of ARF.  Pt required inotrop/pressor
support for ~24 hours with dop gtt at 4-5.  She was easily
weaned off pressors.  No evidence of CNS or cardiac ischemia. No
evidence of distributive shock.  Blood cultures neg.  Does have
UTI, but not uroseptic.  Lactate improved from 3.3 to 1.3.
Antihypertensives were held in the setting of hypotension; they
were continued to be held on transfer to the floor. Within 24
hours of being on the floor, pt developed hypertension to 200s
systolic, during which she developed flash pulmonary edema. See
next issue for details. Pt was started on nitro drip and
restarted on po lopressor w/ improved blood pressure.
Hydralazine was subsequently added and nitro drip was titrated
down. Pt was subsequently restarted on imdur and valsartan;
nitro drip and hydralazine were discontinued. Pt's home
antihypertensive regimen of lopressor, valsartan, and imdur were
titrated for optimal bp control.
.
2.  Pump: 82 y/o female with PMH CAD (s/p recent PCI), diastolic
dysfunction, AS, AF (s/p cardioversion, on amiodarone) admit
w/acute decompensated CHF. Possible etiologies include high
output failure in setting of UTI/fever, hypertension in setting
of diastolic dysfunction. Pt was admitted cold and wet in class
IV HF, secondary to recent fluid boluses in the form of heparin
bolus and IVF bolus.  She diuresed very well with IV lasix. She
was transiently on dopamine drip in the CCU for blood pressure
support, which helped with diuresis. Pt was hypoxic on admission
and required positive pressure vent with BiPAP for ~24 hours.
She was continued on CPAP at night. On floor day 1, pt developed
flash pulmonary edema in the setting of severe hypertension off
antihypertensives. She was noted to be hypoxic to 70s on 4L,
with increase to mid 90s on 100% NRB. She was started on nitro
gtt, lopressor, and hydralazine for BP control. CXR confirmed
worsened pulmonary edema.  She was given lasix for diuresis.
After adequate diuresis and BP control, pt was able to be weaned
down on her oxygen requirement. Pt was restarted on heart
failure regimen of lopressor, valsartan, imdur; nitro gtt was
weaned and hydralazine discontinued. Pt was diuresed with IV
lasix daily for goal 1L daily, with signficant respiratory
improvement. Pt should continue to be diuresed w/ IV lasix for
48 hours for goal negative 500cc daily prior to being switched
to a po lasix regimen.
.
3.  CAD:  Pt is s/p NTSEMI last month and is s/p PTCA to prox
and mid LAD [**4-26**].  Pt was continued on asa, plavix, and statin.
On admission was noted to have a slight troponin bump likely
from demand ischemia and decompensated heart failue.  She was
restarted on bb, [
