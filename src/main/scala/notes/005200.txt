ADDENDUM:  This dictation is an addendum for the patient
[**Known firstname 1312**] [**Known lastname **] who was expected to be discharged on [**2193-7-1**],
however, due to delay in rehab placement the patient was
maintained in our hospital facility for an extra day at which
time the patient's coagulation was rechecked after 1 mg
dosing of Coumadin.  The patient's coagulation on [**2193-7-2**]
revealed PT of 21.9, PTT 75.7, elevated from 73.9 the day
prior and INR of 3.2, which was elevated from 2.9 the day
prior.  Due to the fact that the patient's PTT was rather
elevated and continued to rise, at this time we recommend the
patient pursuing a hematology workup for this issue as an
outpatient.  In regard to the patient's Coumadin titration,
because of the patient's very labile response to Coumadin
dosing, the patient's coagulation should be checked daily
with Coumadin dosing current set for 1 mg every other day.
This would mean Coumadin dosing starting [**2193-7-3**] of 1 mg and
additional dosing on [**2193-7-5**] of 1 mg of Coumadin.  Rehab
facility should titrate the Coumadin dosing with the daily
INR check with the therapeutic range target of 2.5 to 3.0.

At this time discharge status and discharge diagnoses are
unchanged.  Discharge medications are also unchanged except
for Coumadin dosing and recommendation of daily coagulation
checks.
