History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 9220**] is an 85 year old male with a history of recent
admission [**Date range (1) 9221**] for bilateral SDH s/p burr holes [**4-23**],
atrial fibrillation now off Coumadin on Digoxin, hypertension,
and diastolic dysfunction who presents from [**Hospital **] Rehab with
possible digoxin toxicity leading to ventricular tachycardia and
unresponsiveness.
.
The patient was recently hospitalized from [**Date range (3) 9222**] after
a fall complicated by hesitant speech and some difficulty
ambulating, and head CT on admission showed acute on chronic
bilateral subdural hematomas with mass effect and evidence of
early downward transtentorial herniation. He had bilateral burr
holes placed by neurosurgery on [**4-23**]. CXR on [**4-24**] showed
increasing left basilar opacification, and he was thought to
have an aspiration PNA and CHF. He was transferred to medicine
and treated with a 10 day course of Cipro and Flagyl. He had
diarrhea and leukocytosis, but C. diff negative x3. He was kept
NPO and his Na rose to 150 on [**4-27**], and this was treated with
D5W. His atrial fibrillation was difficult to control, and
required uptitration of his Metoprolol. (Note: As an outpatient,
he was on Amiodarone). His home dose of Coumadin 2.5 mg daily
was restarted [**4-30**] (7 days post-op). He then developed atrial
fibrillation with RVR, hypotension, and hct drop and was
transferred to the MICU. Warfarin was discontinued. EP was
consulted and recommended Metoprolol and Digoxin. He continued
to have cough and was discharged on empiric Vanc/Zosyn for a 14
day course. At the time of discharge, his WBC was 15.1, Hct
26.1, Na 140, Cr 0.9, Dig level 1.3.
.
The following information was obtained from a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].
Upon discharge to [**Hospital1 **], his temperature was 102.3 on the
evening of admission, and he remained febrile until [**5-28**]. He had
continued to have diarrhea, and had a rectal tube in place until
2 days PTA. He developed renal failure over the past 1 week. The
physician there was concerned that the Vancomycin IV bid was
contributing to his renal failure, so it was changed to Vanco IV
daily. When the Vanc/Zosyn were completed, he was started on
Vanco and Flagyl PO for presumed C. diff. He had an NG tube
placed in order to get free water boluses, which was removed 2
days PTA. Over the past 2 days, the patient has had almost no PO
intake and very dry mouth. His Lasix was being held for the
renal failure. On the day PTA, his labs showed WBC 17.3, Na 149,
Cr 2.8, BNP 519. Because of the continued leukocytosis, he was
started on Ceftazidime 2 gm IV daily. His Dig level was found to
be 2.2, so his Digoxin was decreased to 125 mcg daily. There was
no Digibind in the facility. On the morning of admission, the
patient was found to have bradycardia to 32 on telemetry and
then went into a "torsades" rhythm. His bp was down to 92/52
(from a baseline of SBP 130-140, and a code was called as the
patient was more unresponsive. no meds were given as there was
no Magnesium was in the building, and the patient remained
arousable to stimuli. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED, vitals were temp 98.1, HR 40-90, bp 140/90, RR 20,
SaO2 100% on RA. His WBC was up to 15.7 (from 15.1 on discharge
[**5-25**]), Hct 35.3 (from 26.1), Na 157 (from 140), Cr 2.7 (from
0.9), Dig 2.8 (from 1.3). TropT 0.08, CK 20, MB not done. The
patient was awake and verbal, but moaning. EKG showed slow
atrial fibrillation, with bradycardia down to 30-50. CXR
Portable showed persistent left retrocardiac opacity likely due
to pleural effusion and atelectasis although underlying
consolidation cannot be excluded. CT Head showed stable
appearance of small bilateral subdural fluid collections and
small unchanged focus in the right frontal cortex, but no new
hemorrhage or infarct. He was given 1 L NS, Potassium 40 mEq per
1 L, and Digibind 50 mL, and Zofran 4 mg IV x1.
.
Unable to obtain ROS as patient not responding.
