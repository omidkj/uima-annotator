#RADIOlOGY:
[]CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2166-7-12**] 8:44 AM
IMPRESSION:  Persistent mild interstitial abnormality with
subtle increased opacity at the right lower lung field,
concerning for pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.

[]CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2166-7-13**] 3:06 AM
IMPRESSION:
1.  Stable cardiac and mediastinal contours with a somewhat
unfolded tortuous aorta.  There continues to be an interstitial
abnormality in the lungs which likely is related to the
patient's known history of small airways disease.  No evolving
airspace consolidation is appreciated.  There are no pleural
effusions or pneumothoraces.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
There is slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle which
could reflect a trace effusion.  There is an old left 6th
posterolateral rib fracture.
