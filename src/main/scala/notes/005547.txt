s/p fall

central venous line
anesthesia


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 75926**] is a 63 yo M with history of HTN, DM,
hypercholesterolemia and CAD s/p CABG who presented to the ED
after a mechanical fall. He was walking into his kitchen,
slipped on a bag and fell on his left thigh. He did not have any
loss of consciousness, chest pain, shortness of breath,
dizziness or lightheadedness either preceding or following the
event. He believes he hit the left side of his head. He banged
on the floor of his apt to alert his son who lives below him. He
had L thigh pain, no other pain. His son called EMS. The pain is
severely exacerbated with minimal movement. He denies any recent
illness.
.
ROS: He denies any fevers, chills, or night sweats, TIA, deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. He denies constipation, diarrhea.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for increased LE edema over
the past two weeks, which he attributes to dietary indiscretion.
He has been cutting back on salt in his diet and noted some
improvement in the edema. He also has DOE. At baseline he is
able to walk [**4-12**] blocks without dyspnea. No change in functional
status recently. Negative for chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. Last
episode of CP was > 6 months ago.
.
ED Course: Vital signs were T97.6, BP98/69, HR76, RR18, O2sat
95% on RA. CXR was unremarkable. Femur film showed femoral neck
fracture. He was seen by ortho in the ED. He is admitted to
medicine due to complicated cardiac history.
.
Of note, the patient suffered from a head injury ([**5-14**]) which
resulted in a subdural hematoma. He suffered seizures from this
and was started on anticonvulsants. He self d/c'd this
medication and has not suffered from any seizures since that
time. However, he is not currently on anticoagulation for his
atrial fibrillation. Prior to restarting he will need to be
cleared by neurology.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T 97.4, BP 102/64, HR 70, RR 20, O2sat 96% on 2L.

LUNGS: Clear anteriorly and laterally
ABD: Soft, NT, ND. NL BS. No HSM

Pertinent Results:
LABS:
TFTs: TSH 5.6  FT4 1.6  T3 159
.
MICRO:
Urine [**2111-11-15**]: UA negative; UCx MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3
COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT WITH SKIN AND/OR GENITAL
CONTAMINATION.
.
CT Head [**2111-11-15**]: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage,
edema, shift of normal midline structures or hydrocephalus. The
appearance of chronic left parietal infarction. There is
extensive mucosal thickening involving right maxillary sinus.
The rest of imaged paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
well aerated.IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
.
XR femur, pelvis [**2111-11-15**]: There is a left femoral neck fracture
with proximal displacement of the distal fracture fragment as
well as varus angulation of the fracture fragment. There are
extensive vascular calcifications. IMPRESSION: Left femoral neck
fracture.
.
ECG [**2111-11-15**]: Tracing shows irregular ventricular pacing with
capture. Compared to prior tracing of [**2111-5-25**] atrial pacing is
no longer seen. Ventricular pacing now appears irregular raising
the possibity of intercurrent development of atrial fibrillation
and suggesting, if so, that pacemaker should be reprogrammed.
Suggest clinical correlation and repeat tracing.
.
CT head/neck [**2111-11-17**]: No C-spine fx. No ICH. No acute process.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 year old man with MMP including severe ischemic
cardiomyopathy, DM2, CKD admitted with left hip fracture, then
PEA arrest following anesthesia induction, minimally responsive
since then and eventually made CMO on [**2111-11-21**] after extubation
and change of code status to DNR/DNI to comfort measures only.
On [**11-22**] he died at 05:50 of cardiopulmonary arrest, immediate
cause s/p PEA arrest on [**11-16**].
.
1. s/p pulseless arrest, neurologic status: Event most likely
due to pre-load dependence secondary to significant
cardiomyopathy exacerbated by induction of general anesthesia.
Cycled cardiac enzymes.  Peaked at 0.1. Down to 0.06. CT head
and CT cspine neg for C-spine injury or bleed. Pt transiently
required levophed gtt. Extubated [**11-21**] as above, then CMO since
persistently minimally responsive with suspected major
neurological damage since event.
.
2. Respiratory failure: initially intubated s/p PEA arrest. Kept
on AC, then PSV until successfully extubated on [**2111-11-21**] but
still only minimally responsive. DNR/DNI since then in agreement
with family, followed by CMO status.
.
3. Fever: Pt spiked intermittently. [**Month (only) 116**] have been due to
infection, however, more likely due to CNS ischemia.
Pan-cultured [**11-17**], [**11-18**], [**11-21**].  NGTD. Made CMO on [**11-21**].
.
4. Hip fracture - with femoral neck fracture. Made CMO on [**11-21**].
Pain was controlled with morphine drip.
.
5. DM: insulin sliding scale, added basal.
.
6. F/E/N: IVF. Repleted lytes PRN. Started tube feeds following
nutrition recs.
.
7. PPx: Bowel regimen, PPI, sq Heparin until made CMO on [**11-21**]
.
8. Access: RIJ until [**11-21**], PIV
.
