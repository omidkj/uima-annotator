Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 348**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 74 yof h/o bilateral PE's, AF (currently
anticoagulated), COPD, CAD and dementia, unclear baseline,
recently discharged to nursing home on [**12-4**] to complete 10 day
course of cefepime and vancomycin for presumed HCAP, transferred
from nursing home for concern of alt. mental status with inc.
lethargy. At baseline from prior DC summaries patient is awake,
confused, oriented to name but answers commands.
.
Per MICU note, initial ED vitals were 98.2  86  119/60  16  98
(unknown home much O2). Underlying PNA was thought to be
etiology of AMS and patient was continued on Vanc / Cefepime.
ABG showed PCO2 of 81 and patient was started on BIPAP 12/5.
Note baseline CO2 from prior ABG's is from high 50's - 70's.
Patient was continued on antibiotics and completed her 10 day
course on [**12-9**].
.
During interview upon transfer, patient reports she was brought
to hospital because people felt she had another PNA. She
reported cough, but denied any fevers, chills, abdominal pain,
nausea or vomiting. She did report some discomfort with
urination but was unable to elaborate further or even if this
was new or old.  She reports pain in her bilateral lower
extremities, a chronic issue [**3-10**] severe arthritis, and she
reports being wheel chair bound at baseline.  She also endorsed
a history of smoking and known dx of COPD, requiring O2 at
baseline but was unable to elaborate further.
.
Vital signs at transfer evaluation were  77 irreg. 167/81  18
94 1L.
Patient was alert, oriented to self only and able to answer some
questions.  She had impaired attention but was able to follow
most commands and participated in a brief neurological
evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 74 yof h/o bilateral PE's, AF, COPD, CAD and dementia, s/p
completion of 10 day course for HCAP with vancomycin and
cefepime, transferred from nursing home for concern of alt.
mental status with inc. lethargy and found to be CO2 retaining.
.
#. CO2 Retention: endorses h/o COPD and smoking but unable to
elaborate further. [**Month/Year (2) 1570**]'s strongly suggestive of obstructive lung
disease. At baseline, ABG's reveal element of CO2 retention with
CO2's ranging from 50-70's. Unclear whether CO2 retention was
exacerbated by over resucitation with O2 OR whether COPD flare
led to CO2 retention and AMS. Patient did not endorse SOB,
fevers, chills or additional infectious Sx and patient is s/p
full 10 day course of IV ABx. At admission patient was placed on
BIPAP with rapid improvement of her ABG and mental status.
Patient was NOT noted to be fluid overloaded and likley picture
represented COPD exacerbation s/p recent PNA. Patient was
maintained on PRN nebs. She did not experience any nocturnal
desaturations and mental status remained at baseline throughout
hospitalization. Pulmonology was consulted regarding potential
evaluation for nocturnal BIPAP for COPD treatment and
arrangements were made at the time of discharge for pulmonology
follow up for further evaluation and management.
.
#. Altered Mental Status: AMS was attributed to CO2 retention,
strengthened by rapid improvement with BIPAP.  Neuro exam was
non-focal and imaging was not suggestive of any acute event. At
baseline patient is interactive, able to answer questions and
follow commands. She is oriented only to self.
.
#. Pneumonia: initial CXR was a poor study with low lung volumes
with possible continued retrocardiac infiltrate. Patient was
afebrile with normal WBC count. Antibiotics were continued to
complete 10 day course from prior admission for HCAP.  This was
felt to likely represent treated PNA with residual CXR changes.
Further antibiotics were deferred.
.
# DM II: patient was initially hypoglycemic at admission but
easily correct with improvement mental status. This episode may
have contributed to overall clouded clinical picture.  Patient
was maintained on ISS and her regular daily insulin regimine was
continued at discharge.
.
# AF: patient remained rate controlled throughout stay.  She was
monitored on telemitry throughout her stay on the floor.
Metoprolol, diltiazem and coumadin were continued.  Of note, her
coumadin was increased at discharge for a subtherapeutic INR.
.
# Code status: presumed full confirmed at 10/27
.
# Contacts: daughter [**Name (NI) 717**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 80360**]
.
# Dispo: patient was discharged to [**Location (un) 745**] HCC with follow up
appointments with pulmonology and for sleep study.
