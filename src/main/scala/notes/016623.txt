Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins / Morphine / Adhesive Tape / Rofecoxib / Albuterol

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Nasal BiPAP

History of Present Illness:
57 yo F with hx of tracheobronchomalacia, s/p stent removal in
[**Month (only) 956**] who presents with 1 day of productive cough, increasing
SOB, and chills. Her symptoms started acutely yesterday. The
cough is productive of moderate amounts of dark-yellow mucous.
The patient was using acetylcysteine at home w/o relief. She
also reports chest tightness/pressure over her upper chest,
radiating into her back. She reports that she had similar pain
with episodes of severe SOB in the past two months. The pain is
pleuritic and gets worse with a deep breath and coughing, but
not positional. It is about a [**8-5**] currently. The patient
reports similar exacerbations of her pulmonary status in the
recent past for which she was hospitalized at [**Hospital3 5097**]. The
patient denies any fever, but reports chills starting yesterday
as well. She patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in interventional
pulmonary. She is status post tracheal stent removal in [**Month (only) 956**]
which was placed for severe bilateral bronchomalacia and mild
tracheomalacia however was complicated with mucus plugging and
granulation tissue. She was supposed to be on Bipap at home
however was unable to obtain it as her insurance does not cover
it. She denies any sick contacts.

ED course: VS T 99 HR 105 BP 154/89 RR - 97 % RA
In the ED the patient was found to be markedly tachypneic
without hypoxia. No ABG was done. Labs showed an elevated WBC at
16,000 with 7,9 eosinophils. An EKG showed no evidence of acute
ischemia. A CXR showed no acute change. Pt was given Vancomycin,
Clindamycin and Levofloxacin however Vancomycin was stopped
after the patient developed a red rash over her infusion site
for which the patient received Diphenhydramine. Patient was also
treated with Methylprednisolone 125mg x1 and nebulizers for
possible bronchospasm. She was never hemodynamically unstable.
Pt was tried several times of BIPAP but continued to be
increasingly tachypneic, speaking only in few words sentences
when of the BiPAP.

ROS: negative for diarrhea, constipation, weight loss, dysuria,
changes in the color of the urine or stool. Notable for
fibromyalgia symptoms, shortness of breath even at rest "with
doing nothing", longstanding abdominal pain.

MICROBIOLOGY:

Rapid Respiratory Viral Antigen Test (Final [**2184-4-12**]): Negative
for Flu
Urine Culture [**2184-4-11**]: Negative

STUDIES:
========
EKG [**2184-4-11**]: Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm with borderline
resting sinus tachycardia.  Slow R wave progression is
non-diagnostic but cannot exclude prior anteroseptal myocardial
infarction. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2184-3-5**] no diagnostic change.

EKG [**2184-4-12**]: Baseline artifact. Sinus rhythm. QRS duration is
about 90 milliseconds. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2184-4-11**] no diagnostic change with the abnormalities as
previously reported.
TRACING #2

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2184-4-11**]
AP UPRIGHT CHEST: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
unremarkable. The lungs are clear except for left lower lobe
atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion. There is no
pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2184-4-14**]
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, there are no
major changes. The structure and transparency of the lung
parenchyma is unremarkable, there are no focal or diffuse
parenchymal opacities. The size and shape of the cardiac
silhouette is within normal ranges. There is slight tortuosity
of the thoracic aorta, there is no evidence of hilar or
mediastinal masses. No evidence of pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION: Unchanged radiographic appearance without evidence
of parenchymal opacities suggestive of pneumonia.

CT Trachea [**3-18**]:
1.  Tracheobronchomalacia confirmed by a decrease of more than
50% of diameter on expiration views as detailed above.
2.  Focal areas of peribronchial infiltration in both lungs
likely
inflammatory or post-infectious in etiology.
3.  Nodular thickening involving the posterior wall of the upper
trachea likely reflecting sequela of previous stent placement in
this region.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 34150**] is a 57 y.o. with severe bilateral tracheomalacia who
presents with tachypnea.

# Tachypnea: Most likely due to tracheobronchitis.  DFA for
influenza was negative.  CXR did not show any infiltrates.  Pt
completed course of levofloxacin and was started on
methylprednisolone 80 mg TID for bronchospasm, which was then
discontinued after a steroid burst. Frequent nebulizer
treatments were given.  During hospitalization, she was started
on nasal BiPAP (better tolerated than full mask).  CPAP was
attempted, but she was not able to tolerate this.  She was
continued on nasal BiPAP with good relief.  IP followed the
patient during hospitalization and decided to not place another
stent as she had a complicated course after her 1st stent
placement with frequent infections.  She is being discharged to
rehabilitation facility for pulmonary needs and then will be
re-admitted on [**4-21**] for a planned tracheobronchoplasty.

# Chest pain: Most likely due to tracheobronchitis. Ruled out
for MI with negative cardiac enzymes x 3. Responded to low dose
IV morphine.  She was switched to longer acting po Percocet for
pain control and monitored on telemetry without
