History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 916**] is a 69 y/o gentleman with multiple risk factors who
was seen for stress testing. He was recently admitted
[**Date range (1) 39783**] to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service for shortness of breath and
found to have a new cardiomyopathy with EF 30% and global
hypokinesis with some akinesis of the inferior wall. He was seen
by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic on [**2165-3-1**] where he reported worsening
shortness of breath and symptoms of advanced heart failure.
Stress testing with additional vascular imaging was planned.
The patient underwent pharmacologic stress testing this morning
with development of ischemic ECG changes (worsening global ST
depression) along with hypotension. He was brought to nuclear
medicine for imaging, and then directly admitted to the
cardiology service.
Since his discharge in [**Month (only) 1096**] he has not been as active, but
notes his breathing is much better. He is able to ambulate about
50ft before becoming short of breath.
He has noted increasing swelling in both legs since discharge
and a slight worsening in the wound on the back of his left
lower leg. He is not able to go shopping on his own anymore as
he gets tired. He denies any pain or cramping in his legs with
ambulation; it is mainly his shortness of breath that limits his
activities.
Cardiac catheterization was performed. Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] was
consulted for coronary revascularization as well as Aortic root
enlargement and Aortic valve replacement.

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2165-3-29**].
Intravenous administration of echo contrast was used due to poor
native endocardial border definition.

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. The IVC
was not visualized. The RA pressure could not be estimated.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size. No LV
mass/thrombus. Severely depressed LVEF. No resting LVOT
gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
Paradoxic septal motion consistent with prior cardiac surgery.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level.

AORTIC VALVE: Mechanical aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). Normal
AVR gradient. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Moderate mitral annular calcification. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
Significant PR.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion. Effusion echo dense,
c/w blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. No
echocardiographic signs o
