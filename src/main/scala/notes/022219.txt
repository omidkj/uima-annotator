A/P: 75 yo F with mult medical problems, as above here for
workup of her b/l LE ischemia:
1) LE ischemia-seen by vascular today, recs appreciated.  for
PVR's. For peripheral angiogram in am.  Mucomyst and NaHCO3 pre
and post procedure. may need bypass.
2) NSTEMI-cont BB, statin, amlodipine, nitrate. Add ACEI as
creatinine appears back to baseline. cards consult in am for
poss cath. echo in am. no asa, plavix for now given h/o
bleeding.
3) GIB-cont guaiac stools. cont ppi. GI consult re: colonoscopy.
 will obtain outside records
4) ?HIT-heme consult appreciated.  will start argatroban for now
(at least until platelets >200), will monitor closely for
evidence of thromboembolism.
5) ?PE-will start argatroban, check LENIs, obtain outside VQ
scan.
6) Celiac sprue-cont prednisone as this seems to have helped her
in the past, per patient/family. obtain outside records.
7)Anemia-Ferritin [**2176**] is not c/w Fe deficiency. ? hemolysis,
given high LDH, low haptoglobin, elevated bili, occ schistocytes
on smear. will send DIC labs.  transfuse HCt <30, but may need
steroids. on epo at osh but doubt if this can all be attributed
to CRI.
8)Renal Failure-appears to be back to baseline. cont monitor.
gentle hydration and mucomyst before dye loads.
DM-monitor Glucose tightly. cont Glargine and RISS
9)HTN-cont BB, CCB, nitrate, added ACEI
10)h/o PAF-no heparinoids given ?HIT, no coumadin given possibly
going to OR.  cont argatroban.
11)PPx-argatroban, ppi
12)FEN-diabetic/cardiac diet, replete lytes w/ goal K>4.0, Mg
>2.0
13)Code: Full
14)Dispo: pending cardiac, gi, heme, vascular, anemia workup.

Brief Hospital Course:
This patient was admitted status post angio to evaluate LLE for
gangrenous toes.  Her PT was almost completely occluded.  She
was then brought to the operating room for Lef fem-[**Doctor Last Name **] BPG.  The
operation was relativly uneventful.  The renal team saw the
patient pre-op and at the time dialysis was not started.  She
went to the operating room and while the operation went
uneventfully, she went to the SICU afterwards for failure to
wean vent.  She was started on tube feeds which went well.
While in the SICU, she developed the need for dialysis and CVVHD
was started.  She developed low platlet count, which was treated
with platelet transfusion.  HIT was suspectied but a HIT panel
was negative.  She was continued on Vanco and meropenem.  The
Meropenem was d/c'ed and she was continued for her ulcerated
toes.  She was brought back to the OR on POD2 for bleeding which
was stopped without issue.  She was put on insulin drip in the
SICU due to difficult to control sugars on her tube feeds.  She
was then changed to normal hemodialysis, which she has been
tolerating well.  On POD5/6 she was extubated and did well with
out the ventalatory assistance.  On POD [**5-14**] she was transfered
to the VICU where she did well.  On the morning of transfer
however, she had breating difficulty and was felt to be be
acutly fluid overloaded,  she was brought to dialysis acutely,
and her tachypnea improved.  She imroved from this and was
transfered to the floor.  She did well on the floor and she was
[**Hospital 57325**] rehab on [**10-16**].  By [**10-18**] rehab was aranged and she was
dischared on PO flagyl for a newly diagnosed C.Diff.
