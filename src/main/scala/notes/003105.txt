Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9824**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea, Gastrointestinal bleed

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NONE

History of Present Illness:
80 yo F s/p inferior MI, HTN, HLP, DM II, smoking hx, diastolic
CHF (last EF 55%), COPD (2L home O2, last FEV1= 0.61) presenting
with 2-3 weeks of worsening of baseline exertional dyspnea x [**5-6**]
months. Of note, has been on successive prednisone tapers x2
since [**6-5**] for COPD exacerbation. Two weeks ago was tapered off
steroids, and promptly had worsening SOB at rest, was placed
back on steroids, which have been tapered to 10 mg qday
currently. Over past 5 months, progressive exertional dyspnea
progressed to SOB after [**3-6**] steps in her home, relieved by rest
x several minutes. Yesterday, woke up in middle of night with
sudden-onset SOB, assx with diaphoresis and warmth. Better with
position upright and hand-held O2, enabling her to return to
sleep. In AM, when walking to car outside her home for MD
appointment, felt recurrence of similar feeling of SOB, not
clearly relieved with nebulizers x2, advair, oxygen, poorly
relieved by rest. Driven by daughter to clinic, where found to
have 81% on 3L NC, HD stable (no tachycardia). Referred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further eval and mgmt. Of note, during her episodes of
exertional dyspnea does she NOT experience CP/pressure,
palpitations, lightheadedness, dizziness, syncope, LE pain or
increased edema. No fever, chill, night sweat, change in weight.
No wheeze, hemoptysis, history of DVT/PE; chronic cough x1 year
productive of green phlegm. Does have stable 3-pillow orthopnea
and some PND (not as severe as yesterday). No recent med changes
other than prednisone taper, increase in Advair to 500/50, and
lisinopril from 10 to 20 mg qd ([**7-2**]). Compliant with meds, no
dietary indiscretion. ROS otherwise negative.

ED COURSE: Was hypotensive to SBP 80s in ED, tachycardic to
120s, w/desat to 80??????s-90??????s. CXR negative for acute process;
+CHF. Labs showed HCT drop to 26 (baseline 35), acute on chronic
RF with K at 5.9, no EKG changes. Received kayexalate x 30 gm PO
and 1 U PRBC + lasix w/ improvement in BP. Found to be guiac
positive w/history of leiomyoma per EGD. NGT dropped w/+aspirate
that cleared w/lavage => ?traumatic. GI consulted, pt to EGD in
AM. Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for hemodynamic monitoring overnight.

[**Company 191**] COURSE: Was given a trial of lasix and her breathing
improved. Was continued on lasix 80 mg QD. Her creatinine
started rising (1.4 to 1.9) while on lasix and so her lasix dose
was changed to 40 mg QD. Her lisinopril was held [**3-5**] rising
creatinine. She was put on a taper of Prednisone 5mg and will be
continued until [**8-21**]. She had few days of gross hematuira [**3-5**]
to foley coming out with balloon inflated. Her hematuria
eventually got better.
Her HCT was stable during the course of admission to the [**Hospital1 **].
She has an appointment with GI on [**8-28**] for a Esophageal USG for
evaluation of GI bleed.

[**8-12**] Echo
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary
to hypokinesis of the posterior wall. No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
defect. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**2-2**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (tape unavailable
for review) of [**2137-7-29**], the posterior wall may now be
hypokinetic, but the technically suboptimal nature of the
present study precludes definitive assessment of regional left
ventricular contractile function.
