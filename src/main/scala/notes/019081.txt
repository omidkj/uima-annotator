HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This a 73-year-old gentleman
who was referred to the Urology Service after a workup for
hematuria prompted a pelvic MRI on [**12-20**].  Findings on
that study were significant for a large mass on the left side
of the bladder consistent with a primary neoplasm extending
into the muscle without definite evidence of extension into
the pelvic-floor fat.  There were also multiple bony
metastases noted in the pelvis along with a small lymph node
in the right external iliac chain.  The patient was
subsequently scheduled for a transurethral resection of
bladder tumor with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9125**] on [**2109-12-25**].

On the evening of [**2109-12-22**], the patient's family
contact[**Name (NI) **] the GU resident on call with concerns of
Mr.  [**Known lastname 25823**] profound weakness and pallor.  The patient's
family was advised to bring the patient into the emergency
department for prompt evaluation.  In the emergency
department the patient was found to be in severe diabetic
ketoacidosis with INR of 7; potassium of 7.5, blood glucose
of 800 and hematocrit of 25.  He was passing large clots from
his penis.  The EKG done at that time was notable for peak T
waves and a prolonged PR interval.  The patient was promptly
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for management of
his diabetic ketoacidosis.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a nondrinker and a former
smoker, who recently began smoking again.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination on admission revealed the
following:  Vital signs:  Temperature 99.5, heart rate 95
sinus, blood pressure 99/31, respiratory rate 28, oxygen
saturation 99% on two liters.  LUNGS:  Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  HEART:  Heart had a regular rate
and rhythm with a mechanical S1 and S2.  ABDOMEN:  His belly
was soft, nontender, and nondistended with normoactive bowel
sounds.  He had positive stool in his rectum.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient had a white count of 28,000,
hematocrit of 25.1, PT 32, PTT 91.4, and INR or 7.1, sodium
125, potassium 7.0, chloride 94, bicarbonate 16, BUN 112,
creatinine of 4.1, and blood glucose of 795.  Urinalysis was
notable for large amounts of blood, positive nitrites,
greater than 100,000 glucose, 15 white blood cells, few
bacteria.  The LFTs were normal.  He had a chest x-ray, which
was notable for mild cardiomegaly, but without evidence of
pneumonia or congestive heart failure.  The EKG was notable
for prolonged PR interval and peaked T waves.

The patient was admitted to the medical ICU.  He was
transfused with two units of packed red blood cells, given
vitamin K, and transfused with fresh frozen plasma to correct
his coagulopathy.  He was started on Ceftriaxone for presumed
urinary tract infection.  He was placed on an insulin drip
and he was aggressively hydrated for the metabolic acidosis
and acute renal failure.  Cardiac enzymes were subsequently
sent, which ultimately ruled him out for a myocardial
infarction.  Foley was changed out to a three-way catheter
and constant bladder irrigation was initiated.

The patient responded well to the initiation of the
above-mentioned therapies.  His coagulopathy resolved as did
his diabetic ketoacidosis.

Over the course of the next two days, the patient remained in
the ICU.  An endocrine consultation from the [**Last Name (un) **] Service
was obtained for management of the patient's labile blood
glucose.  The Renal Service was consulted to make
recommendations regarding the patient's acute renal failure.

On [**2109-12-25**], the patient underwent a renal ultrasound, which
was notable only for small cysts in the left kidney with no
evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter.

The remainder of his ICU course was relatively uneventful.
He continued to improve on all indices.

On [**12-25**], the patient was transferred out of the ICU
into the medical floor.  Both his blood and urine cultures
had no growth.  His white count had dropped from 28,000 to
14,000 and his antibiotics were switched to Levaquin.  The
patient was taken off his insulin drip and transferred to the
floor in stable condition.

Continued workup included echocardiogram performed on [**12-26**], which demonstrated mild left ventricular hypertrophy,
2+ MR, 2+ TR and ejection fraction of greater than 55%.

On the 25th, he had a bone scan, which was notable for
multiple bony metastases, as well as numerous small foci of
increased uptake consistent with metastatic disease.  The
oncology service was consulted and among their
recommendations was a request for plain films of the hip to
rule out impending fracture.  This study was ultimately done
on [**2109-12-29**] and it was without any significant
findings.

On [**12-27**], the patient underwent an uncomplicated
transurethral resection of bladder tumor.  Findings during
that procedure were significant for a large apparently
invasive bladder tumor mostly on the left lateral wall of the
bladder.  The left ureteral outlet was identified and it was
believed that there was tumor growing into the left UO.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well.  The patient was
transferred to the GU Service postoperatively.

The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was relatively
uneventful.  The patient remained afebrile throughout the
entire course.  His blood glucoses, however, remained to be
somewhat challenging; these were primarily managed by
recommendations from the [**Last Name (un) **] Staff.  He was able to start
a regular diet immediately after reaching the floor.

On postoperative day #2, the CBI was discontinued.  The Foley
remained.  He was placed on oral pain medication.  He was
restarted on his Coumadin at a dose of 10 q.h.s.  He was
begun on a Heparin drip for the purposes of anticoagulation
for his St. [**Last Name (un) 923**] valve.

The patient was rapidly therapeutic on the heparin.  The
patient was screened for rehabilitation and offered at bed at
[**Location (un) 1036**].  Unfortunately, because they were unable to
manage the heparin drip while the Coumadin was becoming
therapeutic, the patient needed to stay in the hospital so
that this could be maintained.

By postoperative day #5, the patient had continued his
perioperative Ciprofloxacin antibiotic coverage and he was
afebrile.  The rest of his vitals were stable and his oxygen
saturations ranged from 94% to 98% on room air.  Blood
glucose levels were under better control.  He continued to
tolerate a regular diet with excellent urine output.  The
patient's urine, which had cleared up postoperatively, once
again became grossly hematuric, after the initiation of his
heparin.  After ensuring that there were no clots, and that
the patient was not in retention, the heparin was continued.
