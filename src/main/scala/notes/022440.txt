Admission Date:  [**2121-5-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2121-6-5**]


Service:  ACOVE

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female
with past medical history significant for hypertension,
coronary artery disease, chronic cough, who presents with
increased shortness of breath and cough for a few days.
Patient reports that she has had a dry cough occasionally
productive of clear sputum for approximately one year.
However, in the days prior to admission, she had a dramatic
increase in her shortness of breath and cough.

Denies any fever or chills.  No orthopnea or PND.  No chest
pain or swelling of legs.  Patient has had a poor appetite
prior to admission.  Husband has had a cough, but the patient
has no other sick contacts.

EMS was called to see the patient at home for respiratory
distress.  She was found to have oxygen saturation in the
80s, and was hypertensive.  She was given six sublingual
nitroglycerin and 80 mg of IV Lasix, 4 mg of Morphine, and
placed on a nonrebreather.  In the Emergency Department, the
patient was initially hypertensive with low oxygen
saturation.  She was given additional two sublingual
nitroglycerin and an aspirin.  Her blood pressure decreased
to the 80s/50s and 60s/40s.  At that point, dopamine was
started and her blood pressure increased in the
120s-160s/50s.  Eventually, dopamine was titrated off.

Chest x-ray in the ED revealed a right lower lobe and left
retrocardiac opacity and possible congestive heart failure.
Patient was given Levaquin, nebulizers, and required BiPAP
transiently.  Eventually, her blood pressures stabilized in
the 140s-160s systolic and oxygen saturation were 90% on 70%
face mask.  At that point, she was admitted to the VICU for
further evaluation and treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

2. Coronary artery disease.
3. Chronic cough.
4. Status post hysterectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Atenolol.
2. Dyazide.

EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Afebrile, blood pressure 147/38, heart
rate 79, oxygen 100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  General:
Elderly female sitting with head of bed at 45 degrees.  No
apparent distress.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light.  Extraocular motion intact.  Anicteric.
Dry mucous membranes.  Neck:  Supple.  JVD is difficult to
assess.  Lungs:  Scattered large wheezes with crackles at the
bases approximately [**2-1**] of the way up bilaterally.  Scattered
rhonchi throughout.  Cardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm.  S1,
S2.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Obese.  Soft.
Nontender and nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No edema.  2+ dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.  Neurologic:  Alert and oriented times three.
Strength and sensation are grossly intact.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 13.7,
hematocrit 43.3, platelets 319.  Chemistries:  Sodium 137,
potassium 4.2, chloride 100, bicarb 23, BUN 26, creatinine
1.3, glucose 214.  CK 69, troponin 0.02.  PT 12.4, PTT 22.7,
INR 1.0, lactate 2.4.

Chest x-ray:  Collapse and consolidation of the left lower
lobe in the retrocardiac region with mild pleural effusions
bilaterally.  Hazy opacity in the right lower lobe.

IMPRESSION:  Moderate CHF.  Right lower lobe opacity
consistent with pneumonia or lung mass.

EKG:  Sinus rhythm at [**Street Address(2) 55867**] depressions in I, aVL with
biphasic T waves.  Poor R-wave progression.  Q in III, aVF.
LAD.  Normal intervals.  Repeat EKG showed sinus rhythm at [**Street Address(2) 55868**] changes resolved.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Pulmonary:  Initially on admission, the patient was in
respiratory distress felt to be most likely secondary to
pneumonia and superimposed congestive heart failure.  Patient
was treated with a 10-day course of Levaquin for her
community-acquired pneumonia.  In addition, she was gently
diuresed with Lasix as needed based on pulmonary symptoms,
lower extremity edema, and tolerated by her renal function.

Patient continued to have significant wheezing early in
admission, and was felt to have a strong component of
reactive airway disease.  For this, she was started on a
steroid taper on [**2121-5-31**].  In addition, she was continued
on inhalers and nebulizers with good result.

By [**2121-6-5**], her lungs were clear to auscultation
anteriorly and laterally, and she no longer felt short of
breath.

2. Cardiac:  Patient has a history of coronary artery
disease, and her EKG on admission showed ST changes in the
setting of hypertension and tachycardia.  These changes
resolved with resolution of the patient's hypertension.
However, the patient did have elevated cardiac enzymes with
troponins of 0.02, 0.12, and 0.07.  She had no chest pain
during admission.  The patient was continued on her aspirin
and beta-blocker.

Further cardiac issues included new onset of atrial
fibrillation on [**2121-6-3**].  At that time, the patient's
beta-blocker was titrated up and diltiazem was eventually
added for improved rate control.  The patient was also
started on anticoagulation with a Heparin drip as a bridge to
Coumadin.  Cardiology consult was obtained, and the patient
was successfully cardioverted on [**2121-6-4**].  She will remain
on anticoagulation indefinitely.  This is also important as
her echocardiogram showed severe pulmonary hypertension and
patient should also be anticoagulated for this reason.

Complete echocardiogram result from [**2121-5-30**] showed the
left atrium to be moderately dilated.  The left ventricular
cavity size was normal and overall left ventricular ejection
fraction was greater than 55%.  Moderate mitral annular
calcification was visualized with 1+ mitral regurgitation.
Two plus tricuspid regurgitation with severe pulmonary artery
hypertension.  The patient will need a repeat echocardiogram
in [**5-6**] weeks to determine her baseline PA pressures once her
congestive heart failure has completely resolved.

3. Acute on chronic renal failure:  Patient with mildly
elevated creatinine on admission.  It continued to be
elevated throughout the admission ranging from 1.2-1.6.  It
is unclear the patient's baseline creatinine level.  This
will need to be followed as an outpatient.

4. Heme:  Patient with low-grade anemia.  Her hematocrit was
followed closely during the admission, and she required no
blood transfusion.

5. Blood pressure:  Patient was initially hypertensive and
then hypotensive on admission.  However, her blood pressure
quickly stabilized, and she was well controlled throughout
the remainder of admission.

6. FEN:  Two-gram sodium diet.

7. Prophylaxis:  Subq Heparin; proton-pump inhibitor; bowel
regimen.

8. Code:  DNR/DNI.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient will be discharged to the [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab Facility for rehabilitation following her illness.
