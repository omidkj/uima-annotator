Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2840**]
Chief Complaint:
Blood per rectum

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 86 year old with CHF (EF 30%), diastolic CHF, CAD sp MI
with DES placed ([**8-/2157**]) on plavix/asa, afib s/p AV ablation s/p
pacemaker, prior GI bleed in [**2155**] while INR supratherapeutic
without etiology of bleed identified. Patient presents with
bright red blood pre rectum.
.
Over the last three days the patient has become progressively
lethargic and short of breath. Her blood pressure was found to
be lower than normal when checked at her adult day care -
systolics of 90s instead of over 100. The day of presentation
the patient was taken to her PCP given increasing lethargy.
There she was found to have bright red blood in her rectum. She
was sent to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Patient notes no history of abdominal pain, blood per rectum,
melena, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Besides her lethargy and
shortness of breath she has been in her normal state of health.
She notes no history of liver disease or alcohol abuse. No
NSAIDS at home. Pt is on Plavix and ASA.
.
Of note the patient reportedly had a prior GI Bleed in [**2155**].
Apparantly an EGD and Colonoscopy were performed and were
unrevealing. At that time she was on coumadin for her Afib,
INR-5 on presentation, which was discontinued. Since that time
she has had no bleeding per rectum.
.
In the ED, initial vitals 98.3 110 113/57 16 90%. Physical exam
with revealed bright red blood per rectum. Two peripheral IVs,
18guage and 20guage placed. NG lavage without any return.
Initial HCT found to be 24, HCT [**6-/2158**] was 43.5. Repeat HCT
after one unit [**Unit Number **] on green top. Two units pRBCs transfused. EKG
with atrial fibrillation with intermittent demand pacing. GI to
perform EGD this evening. Pt also recieved lasix 40mg IV x one
between blood transfusions, as patient became hypoxic to 86% on
room air. This improved Vitals prior to transfer Afebrile, 82,
129/75, 21, 100% RA.
.
In the MICU patient continue to be hemodynamically stable with
initial BP 100's/80's. She had no complaints and appear to be in
no distress. She communicates through her daughter as she is
cantonese speaking.
.

EIA.
.
ECG [**2158-11-10**]:
Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response with
intermittent
ventricular pacing. Delayed R wave transition. Non-specific ST-T
wave
abnormalities. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2158-3-24**] the
underlying
rhythm is now atrial fibrillation. Clinical correlation is
suggested.
.
ECG [**2158-11-13**]:
Atrial fibrillation with occasional ventricular paced beats.
There are Q waves in leads III and aVF. ST-T wave changes in
leads I, II, III, aVF and V4-V6. Probable prior inferior wall
myocardial infarction. The ST-T wave changes are non-specific
but may be due to ischemia.
.
Portable CXR [**2158-11-14**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
pre-existing right-sided pleural effusion has minimally
increased in extent. The pre-existing left pleural effusion is
unchanged.

Both pleural effusions cause basal areas of atelectasis.
Moderate cardiomegaly with tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. No
newly appeared focal parenchymal opacities.
.
Left UE ultrasound [**2158-11-16**]:
FINDINGS: Grayscale, color and Doppler images were obtained of
the left IJ, subclavian, axillary, brachial, basilic and
cephalic veins. Occlusive thrombus is seen in one of the two
left brachial veins. This vein does not fully compress and does
not demonstrate flow on color Doppler imaging or pulse wave
Doppler imaging.

Normal flow, compression and augmentation is seen in the
remainder of the vessels.

IMPRESSION: Deep vein thrombosis seen in one of the two left
brachial veins.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 86 year old with CHF (EF 30%), diastolic CHF, CAD sp MI
with DES placed ([**8-/2157**]) on plavix/asa, afib s/p AV ablation s/p
pacemaker, prior GI bleed in [**2155**] while INR supratherapeutic
without etiology of bleed identified who presents with bright
red blood pre rectum.
.
#BRBPR: Pt presented with BRBPR and was noted to have blood in
rectal vault at presentation to ED.  Hct on admission was 24
(baseline 40s).  She was transfused a total of 3 units with
subsequent Hct rise to 37.  Transfusion was complicated by mild
hypoxia (86%RA) likely due to acute on chronic systolic heart
failure.  She was evaluated by the gastroenterology team who
performed an EGD showing diffuse gastritis, diverticulum in the
area of the papilla, sm
