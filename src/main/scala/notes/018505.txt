History of Present Illness:
89F with advanced dementia who presents with dehydration,

The patient was a new admission to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**2197-5-1**].  At
that time she was found to be dehydrated and to have a LLL PNA.
In addition, she was delirious and had an elevated WBC.  She was
initially treated with ceftriaxone.  Vancomycin was added on
[**2197-5-5**] for continuing fever and suspicion of MRSA. She was also
started on IV normal saline but remained hypernatremic and
hyperchloremic so was switched on [**2197-5-5**] to D5W.  Her
hematocrit has been decreasing since admission (36.6 initially
then down to 27.2 on [**2197-5-8**]) and was having heme positive
stools since [**2197-5-5**].  In the AM of [**2197-5-9**] her nurse found her
incontinent of stool.  Temperature at that time was 100.2  Also
of note her nares MRSA screen was negative so vancomycin was
discontinued.

She received both influenza and pneumoVax on [**2197-5-1**].

In the ED her vitals were 98.1  103  134/32  28  94%RA.  A CXR
was concerning for LLL infiltrate.  A lactate was  7.4.  She
received ~6L of normal saline. A central line was deferred per
discussion with family and decision that her potential agitation
would be limiting. She received flagyl, po vanco, iv vanco, iv
levaquin. CT abd was declined after discussion with family.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN  [**2197-5-9**] 4:34 PM
FINDINGS: Single rotated supine view of the abdomen was
submitted for review. The right margin of the abdomen is
excluded from view. The ascending and transverse colon are
filled with air, measuring up to 5 cm. Abdominal aorta is
calcified. The patient is post- right total hip replacement.

IMPRESSION: Limited study, no evidence of megacolon.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2197-5-9**] 4:34 PM
FINDINGS: Cardiac size is moderately enlarged, with left
ventricular configuration. The aortic arch is calcified. There
is a retrocardiac opacity, which may represent left lower lobe
atelectasis, consolidation, or combination of both. There is a
small left pleural effusion. Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
There is no pneumothorax. Osseous structures are diffusely
demineralized.

IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe opacity, may represent atelectasis,
consolidation, or combination of both. Small left pleural
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
89 year old woman with advanced dementia, DM2, GERD presenting
with altered mental status, lactic acidosis and abdominal pain
while continuing a recent antibiotic course for pneumonia.

# Sepsis: Hospital acquired pneumonia (LLL) with hx of negative
MRSA screen.  Was started on ceftriaxone on [**5-3**] at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab,
and received 7 days of treatment.  The patient has known risk
factors for multi-drug resistent organisms including
uncontrolled diabetes, nursing home habitation, and severe
pressure ulcers.  Also had lactic acidosis on admission, now
resolved after fluid resuscitation.   Blood pressure has
remained stable throughout her illness.  Started on Vanc/Zosyn
for broad coverage (possible sources include pna, UTI, pressure
ulcers).  Also with significant diarrhea concerning for C. Diff
in the setting of abx use.  Now C. Diff negative x1, labs all
stable, DIC labs negative. Clinically looks well, and is back to
baseline per family.
- No need for broad antibiotic coverage at this point. Will
discontinue and follow clinically at [**Hospital1 100**] Senior Life.
- Follow all cultures, no cough so unable to get sputum. All
NGTD.
- DFA for flu negative
- Urine legionella negative
- DIC and hemolysis labs negative
- Follow for 3rd C. Diff to rule out, continue empiric therapy
with IV flagyl until rules out
- Continue to monitor respiratory status
- IVF prn as low PO

# Altered Mental status: Per family, appears to be at baseline.
Has had significant decline over the past few weeks with regard
to ability to do self-care.  She developed fever and delirium
during her initial admission around [**5-1**] with some improvement
after treatment for underlying pna and dehydration.
- Continue to monitor
- Lights on in am, lights out in pm to avoid sundowning
- Continue frequent reorientation and monitoring

# Acute on chronic blood loss anemia secondary to GI bleed:
After patient was started on abx for her pneumonia, she
developed decreasing Hct, from 32->26.5. Also in the setting of
agressive volume resuscitation.  On admission was 31, now stable
at 23 after significant volume resuscitation (she rec'd 6 L NS
in the ED).  Increased on am labs today.  Guaiac negative in the
ED, positive here, no gross blood.  Anemia likely
