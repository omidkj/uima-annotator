Service:  NEUROMEDIC

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Weakness and confusion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 81 year old woman
with no significant past medical history except for epistaxis
who was admitted on [**2104-8-22**], after having been outdoors
raking leaves and had the abrupt onset of "loss of feeling"
in her arms.  She had crawled on the floor and called her
family member who called EMS to the house.  She was brought
to an outside hospital where she was disoriented and confused
according to the EMT report and progressively more awake on
the way to that outside hospital.  She had apparently
complained of a headache prior to this the night prior with
some weakness in the legs although this story is not entirely
clear at this point.  She was awake when she arrived to the
outside hospital but was still disoriented.  She was noted to
have a right sided hemiplegia with the head turned to the
left as well as an aphasia.  She was stuporous upon
examination by the neurosurgery consultant.  CT of the head
there showed a large left frontoparietal bleed with mass
effect.  She was given Decadron and Ativan and intubated.
She was also loaded with one gram of Dilantin intravenously.
She was hyperventilated but no Mannitol was given there and
she was subsequently transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] for further care.  After being admitted to the
[**Hospital1 69**] NSICU, her examination
was unchanged throughout from the outside hospital
examination.  She was seen by the neurosurgery consult team
who felt that a ventricular drain was not warranted and
unlikely to be beneficial even though there was evidence of
small interventricular bleeding and some falcine herniation
seen on the repeat head CT here.  She was kept in the
Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit, hyperventilated and on
Mannitol, and eventually was extubated three days later.  She
was admitted to the neurology floor after she had been
extubated.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Epistaxis that resolved after a
procedure done at [**State 51252**].

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin.
2.  Tylenol as needed for pain.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER (INPATIENT):
1.  Vancomycin one gram intravenously q24hours.
2.  Hydralazine 10 mg intravenously q6hours.
3.  Acetaminophen 650 mg PR q4-6hours p.r.n. fever.
4.  Famotidine 20 mg intravenously q12hours.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives alone, very independent
woman according to family, doing all her activities of daily
living.  No tobacco or alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of stroke or bleeding.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 98.3, axillary blood
pressure 194/80, heart rate 94, oxygen saturation 95% in room
air.  In general, she is an elderly woman lying in bed with
her head turned to the left.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat examination - There is no scleral icterus.  The lungs
revealed coarse breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.
Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm without murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  The abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities show marked
edema in the right arm and leg.  On neurologic examination,
mental status - The patient is alert, eyes open, does not
close eyes to command or stick out tongue to command.  She is
aphasic.  Her pupils are small approximately 2.0 millimeters
and minimally reactive.  She does not track eye movements.
Her VOR is intact.  Corneals are present.  The eyes are
deviated to the left and she does not blink to threat
approaching the right.  On motor examination, her left leg
withdraws with hip flexion and painful stimulus.  There is a
flicker of toes on the right foot to stimulus.  There is
normal tone on the left side, however, there is increased
tone on the right upper extremity and right lower extremity.
Sensory - She grimaces to pain on the left side and less so
on the right side.

LABORATORY DATA ON TRANSFER:  White blood cell count was
11.2, hematocrit 34.3, MCV 89, platelet count 188,000.
Partial thromboplastin time 21.3, INR 1.1.  Chem7 is
unremarkable.  Her glucose is 109, blood urea nitrogen 19,
creatinine 0.4, sodium 143, potassium 3.0, chloride 111,
bicarbonate 23, albumin 3.1.  Her microbiology studies
included urine culture which was positive for Streptococcus
povus.  Sputum culture is positive for Oxacillin sensitive
Staphylococcus aureus that is coagulase positive.  There are
two out of four blood cultures from [**2104-8-24**], from the same
set growing coagulase negative Staphylococcus with subsequent
surveillance cultures that are negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Right hemiparesis with aphasia - The patient's
examination is consistent with the left frontoparietal as
well as temporal lobe impairment likely due to the edema from
the hemorrhage.  She is spontaneously breathing and has a
right sided hemiparesis and aphasia and does not appear to
follow commands.  Because she is unable to intake nutrition
reliably on her own, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy
tube was placed and this will be used for tube feeding for
nutrition.

2.  Staphylococcus pneumonia - This is likely ventilator
associated but is pansensitive.  She was treated with
Vancomycin for three days initially but after sensitivities
came back, she was switched to Levofloxacin for which this
was sensitive and she will be continued on this for a total
course of antibiotics for fourteen days.  The blood cultures
were felt to be a contaminant since surveillance cultures
were negative and the patient continued to be afebrile on the
antibiotics.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to
rehabilitation.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Tylenol 650 mg PR q4-6hours p.r.n. fever.
2.  Levofloxacin 500 mg nasogastric once daily for seven
days.
3.  Captopril 37.5 mg nasogastric twice a day.
4.  Pantoprazole 40 mg nasogastric once daily.
5.  Lansoprazole 30 mg nasogastric once daily.
6.  Tube feeds are Promote with fiber full strength with
starting rate of 20ml/hour to advance to a goal rate of
60ml/hour by 20ml every six hours.  Flush with 200ml of water
twice a day and hold feedings for residual of 150ml.

FOLLOW-UP PLANS:  The patient is to follow-up with her
primary care physician as needed.  At this time, the patient's
code status is DNR/DNI.
