Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 16352**] is a 74 yo female with PMH significant for DM,
HTN and atrial fibrillation who presents with bilateral LLE
cellulitis. Her hospital course was complicated by increased
respiratory distress and was transferred to the ICU overnight
for closer monitoring.

1)Cellulitis: Patient presented with LE erythema, warmth, and
discharge from the [**Hospital 191**] clinic. She was hospitalized for
cellulitis in [**7-7**] and cultures grew Pseudomonas, which was
sensitive to Cipro. She received Vancomycin and Cipro in the ED.
She remained afebrile with no leukocytosis during her hospital
stay. She was continued on Cipro IV and Vancomycin was added for
gram + coverage. Cipro changed to PO and she was continued on
Vancomycin for +MRSA in wound cultures. PICC line was placed.
She will require 2 week course of antibiotics to be completed on
[**2199-12-19**]. Vancomycin levels should be monitored closely with goal
between 15-20. Podiatry was consulted and they recommended daily
betadine dressing of the L foot. She is scheduled for follow-up
in the podiatry clinic as listed in the discharge instructions.

2)Respiratory distress: Patient acutely decompensated 1-2 days
into admission with increased O2 requirements and a drop in her
O2 saturation into the 70's. Cxray suggested acute pulmonary
edema. This occurred on her last admission and the cause is
unclear. Cardiac enzymes were negative. She was transferred to
the ICU for closer monitoring and was diuresed agressively with
improvement in her respiratory status. She is on Lasix 20mg TID
at home and this was changed to Lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] after she
returned to the medical floor. Her daily I/O's and weights were
closely monitored.

3)Pulmonary hypertension: Secondary to long standing sleep
apnea. Patient has failed multiple CPAP trials on prior
admissions due to urinary incontinence. Pulmonary was consulted
in the ICU and they recommended the following tests once her
volume status had improved: repeat ECHO, R heart
catheterization, PFT's, and CT scan to r/o interstitial lung
disease. CT scan was done during this admission which did not
suggest significant ILD.

4)Hypertension: Patient was continued on home regimen of
Norvasc, Diltiazem, and Lisinopril.

5)Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient's baseline creatinine
is between 1.3-1.5. Initially 1.7 and decreased to 1.6 on day of
discharge. Likely pre-renal component based on physical exam. No
further work-up was done during this admission.

6)Diabetes: Patient continued on home regimen of Insulin 70/30
15 units [**Hospital1 **] with sliding scale. Her sugars were well
controlled.

7)Atrial fibrillation: Patient remains in afib on exam. She
remains asymptomatic. She continues to refuse anti-coagulation.
She was maintained on Diltiazem for rate control.

8)Urinary incontinence: Patient is on long acting form of
Ditropan at home. She was placed on the short acting form on
admission since the long acting form was not available on
formulary. She complained of increased incontinence, likely
secondary to being on short acting form. She was discharged on
long acting form.

9)Anemia: Baseline Hct~ 27. Likely anemia of chronic disease
secondary to chronic renal insufficiency. No further work-up was
done during this admission.

10)Sleep apnea: Patient has been tried on CPAP in the past but
has not been able to wear mask at night due to incontinence. She
underwent CPAP trial during this admission and tolerated well.
She does not want to wear since she has difficulties wearing the
mask and has to go to the bathroom several times during the
night.
