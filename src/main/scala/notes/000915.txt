Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Ampicillin / Codeine / Tetracyclines

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough, fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy x 2
Intubation/extubation, mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
The pt is an 85-yo woman w/ hypertension, hyperchol,
hypothyroid, GERD, anemia, and stage IV CKD (bl Cr 3.2-3.5) who
presents with 1.5 weeks of left side pain and cough. She notes
constant left side and back pain, and feeling weak. She has had
chest congestion with an intermittent cough, productive of a
white sputum. Denies SOB, or chest or abdominal pain. She has
not been eating well, [**12-30**] no appetite. No LH, dizziness, N/V,
diarrhea, or dysuria. She has been taking [**Doctor Last Name 1819**] Aspirin 325mg x2
three times daily for pain. Additionally, she has not gotten out
of bed because of the weakness, and has not been able to care
for herself, needing help getting to the bathroom.
.
In the ED, VS - Temp 99.2F, HR 76, BP 151/80, R 24, SaO2 96% 4L
NC. Labs significant for WBC 10.2 (85.6% PMNs), Cr elevation to
4.5, trop 0.05, and negative UA. ECG was unremarkable. CXR
showed RLL atelectasis and LLL consolidation vs effusion; CT-A/P
confirmed LLL pulm consolidation and RLL atelectasis, as well as
diverticulosis w/o diverticulitis, and stable atrophic kidneys.
She got 1L NS IVF, and Ceftriaxone 1gram IV + Azithromycin 500mg
PO for pneumonia.
.
Prior to transfer to the ICU, patient was treated for CAP with 5
days azithromycin and 14 days ceftriaxone. On [**12-19**] she was
transferred to the MICU and bronched for mucus plugging and
another bronch on [**12-22**] for same reason. She was called out to
the floor on [**12-24**] and had been doing well from a respiratory
standpoint until this morning when she desaturated. Currently,
the patient's breathing is much more comfortable. She was
transitioned to nasal cannula and Venturi mask. She states her
dyspnea is stable. She denies any chest pain, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, or diarrhea.
.
ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision
changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness
of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria,
hematuria.

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Preliminary):

CT ABDOMEN:
IMPRESSION:
1. Left lower lobe pulmonary consolidation, concerning for
pneumonia.
Additional right lower lobe patchy opacities could reflect
atelectasis.
2. Bilateral renal hypodensities, which are incompletely
characterized, but stable, and may reflect cysts.
3. Aortoiliac stent, incompletely assessed without IV contrast.
4. Severe diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
5. Stable retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.

CHEST X-RAY ([**2127-12-15**])
Left lower lobe consolidation, better assessed on the
subsequently performed CT abdomen and pelvis.

CHEST X-RAY ([**2127-12-20**])
There is complete consolidation and opacification of the left
lung with mild mediastinal shift to the left. The right lung is
relatively [**Name (NI) **], and there is minimal atelectasis at
the right lung base. There is a stent in the upper abdomen.
.
[**2127-12-19**] CXR:
new opacification of the LEFT hemithorax. mediastinal shift
indicates left lung collapse. truncation of left main bronchus -
likely due to mucus plug or aspiration. d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] 8:45am
[**2127-12-19**].
.
ECHO: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is mild
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is severe mitral annular calcification. Mild to
moderate ([**11-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2125-1-19**], the aortic stenosis may be slightly worse
(but still only mild).
.
CT chest: 1. Partial atelectasis of the lingula and complete
collapse of left lowerlobe is likely due to mucous impaction,
but a mass cannot be excluded due to absence of contrast
administration.

2. Several pulmonary nodules are predominantly stable. Several
new right
lung lobe nodules are likely inflammatory and can followed by CT
to ensure
stability in 6 months if warranted clinically.

3. Findings suggestive of pulmonary artery hypertension.

4. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes are similar to [**2121-10-30**].
.
Chest Xray ([**2128-1-6**]):  As compared to the previous examination,
there is a complete
collapse of the left lung. As a consequence, there is an
extensive shift of
the mediastinum and the heart to the left. In the right lung,
the parenchyma
shows minimally improved ventilation. No evidence of interval
occurrence of
focal parenchymal opacities on the right.
