[**Last Name (LF) **],[**First Name3 (LF) **] L. Not Finalized

[**4-2**] NCHCT
 No change compared to study on [**2138-3-31**]. Ventricular
size is stable.

[**3-31**] LENIS
No evidence of right or left lower extremity DVT.

NCHCT [**3-31**]
 Little change in appearance of suprasellar mass with associated

mild hydrocephalus, details as above.

[**2138-3-27**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. No significant change in size of the ventricles with residual
mild
hydrocephalus.
2. No change in the size or composition of the pituitary mass.
3. Resolving post-biopsy pneumocephalus.
4. No evidence of new hemorrhage.


[**2138-3-26**]   Radiology MR PITUITARY W&W/O CONT
FINDINGS: Again noted is the large, heterogeneously enhancing
sellar mass
extending to the suprasellar region. The cystic component in the
right
superior-most portion of the mass is also unchanged. The lesion
currently
measures 3.6 (TRV) x 3.1 (AP) x 5.6 cm (CC) [10:12; 6:9],
unchanged in size allowing for differences in imaging modality
and plane of scanning. The inferior portion of the lesion
demonstrates small scattered air pockets. A new relatively
non-enhancing region at the base, extending into the center of
the lesion measures approximately 3.0 x 1.5 (TRV) x 1.3 (AP) x
3.0 cm (CC), likely represents the expected post-biopsy defect.
The lesion continues to exert similar mass effect, displacing
and effacing the optic chasm and the adjacent vasculature.

There is packing material in the nasal passage, with a small
amount of blood.  Moderate mucosal thickening is noted in the
maxillary, ethmoid and frontal sinuses.

The right transfrontal ventriculostomy catheter is unchanged in
position,
terminating near the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**]. There is interval
decrease of the
ventriculomegaly, bilaterally. The biventricular dimension at
the caudate
head measures 3.9 cm now, compared to 4.2 cm on [**2138-3-25**].

The remaining brain parenchyma is grossly unremarkable. The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is preserved. Persistent mild
periventricular T2/FLAIR hyperintensity represents
transependymal CSF migration secondary to the obstructive
hydrocephalus.

IMPRESSION:

1. Expected appearance, status post transsphenoidal biopsy of
the large
sellar/suprasellar mass, with post-surgical defect and
post-operative
pneumocephalus.

2. No evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage.

3. Packing material in the left sphenoid air cell and the nasal
cavity.

4. Right transfrontal ventriculostomy catheter in place, with
slight
short-interval improvement in the degree of obstructive
hydrocephalus, and
persistent periventricular rim of T2-/FLAIR-hyperintensity,
representing
transependymal migration of CSF.


[**2138-3-25**] CT HEAD W/ & W/O CONTRA
FINDINGS: The 3.4 x 3.2 cm pituitary mass is unchanged in
appearance from the prior CT and MRI. It has components that are
both cystic and
hemorrhagic/mineralized. In general it is round, with smooth
borders, and a small outpouching from the right lateral aspect
(5, 26). The mass is in close relationship to multiple arteries.
The basilar arteries and PCA are just posterior to the mass and
are almost contacting the mass (5, 25). The
supraclinoid portions of the internal carotid run just laterally
to the mass.  The mass is laterally displacing the A1 segments
of the bilateral ACAs.

A ventriculostomy catheter is present and in unchanged position
through a
right frontal burr-hole approach with the tip terminating near
the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**] in the left lateral ventricle. Since the
prior exam, the size of the lateral ventricles has slightly
decreased. There is no evidence of
intraventricular hemorrhage or hydrocephalus. The basal cisterns
are patent.

There is no evidence of new hemorrhage. There is mucosal
thickening in the
bilateral maxillary sinuses, some with a polypoid appearance.
The sphenoid
sinus is clear. The sphenoid sinus septum attaches midline both
anteriorly
and posteriorly. The mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities
are clear. Of note there is nonunion of the posterior arch of
the atlas, which could be developmental given the patient's age.


IMPRESSION:
1. Unchanged appearance of large pituitary mass with suprasellar
extension
which is in close proximity to the bilateral anterior cerebral
arteries,
bilateral supraclinoid segments of the intracarotid arteries,
and basilar
artery and P1 segments of the posterior cerebral arteries.
Partially dehiscent dorsum sella.
2. Right ventriculostomy catheter in unchanged position with
interval
decrease in size of the lateral ventricles.
3. No evidence of new hemorrhage.


[**2138-3-25**] CT SINUS W/O CONTRAST
FINDINGS: A 3.8 x 3.4 cm sellar and suprasellar mass does not
appear
significantly changed from the prior MRI and CT examinations.
The mass is in close proximity to the cavernous carotid
segments, A1 and A2 segments. In addition, the dorsum sella
margins are dehiscent and absent [**Female First Name (un) **] few regions, as a result of
which the mass is in close proximity to the Basilar and
posterior cerebral arteries.
A ventriculostomy catheter has been placed via right frontal
approach with
tip near the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 2044**] appearing to cross into the left
lateral
ventricle.

There is mild mucosal sinus disease. There appear to be
