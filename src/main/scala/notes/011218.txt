ERCP [**2124-11-14**]:
FINDINGS: Initial scout films show an aortoiliac graft. After
injection of
contrast, multiple irregular filling defects were seen in the
common bile
duct, common hepatic duct causing partial obstruction. Per ERCP
report, those were found to be stones which were extracted with
a balloon. Multiple filling defects were also seen in the
gallbladder.
Impression:
A gaping major papilla was found, suggestive of a recently
passed stone
A single periampullary diverticulum with large opening was found
at the major papilla.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a
sphincterotome after a guidewire was placed.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete
opacification.
Many irregular stones ranging in size from 6 mm to 10 mm that
were causing partial obstruction were seen at the common bile
duct and common hepatic duct.
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using
a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
A sphincteroplasty to 12mm was performed using a wire guided CRE
balloon to allow stone extraction.
[**4-26**] stones were extracted successfully using a 12 mm balloon.
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for
evaluation and treatment of his abdominal pain. The patient was
admitted to the ICU given his multiple medical problems. [**Name (NI) **]
underwent ERCP on [**2124-11-14**]. He tolerated the procedure well. He
was transfered to the floor without incident on [**2124-11-16**].

Neuro: The patient received IV morphine after his procedure with
good effect and adequate pain control.

CV: The patient was consistently bradycardic during this
admission with heart rate frequently going down to the mid-30s
transiently, although he remained asymptomatic. A cardiology
consult was obtained and followed him during the course of his
stay. No intervention was deemed necessary at this time and he
will be followed as an outpatient for his cardiac issues. The
patient remained otherwise stable from a cardiovascular
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient reported some shortness of breath after
his ERCP. Chest x-ray revealed pulmonary edema. His breathing
improved and his oxygen requirement decreased with diuresis with
lasix. He was weaned off oxygen without difficulty on [**11-17**].
Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and incentive
spirrometry were encouraged throughout hospitalization.

GI/GU/FEN: Post-procedure, the patient was given sips of clears.
Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well tolerated,
and he was placed on a regular diet on [**2124-11-16**]. Patient's
intake and output were closely monitored, and IV fluid was
adjusted when necessary. Foley was placed to aide in the
monitoring of his fluid status. Foley was removed on [**2124-11-17**]
and the patient had no difficulty voiding spontaneously.
Electrolytes were routinely followed, and repleted when
necessary.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection. The patient was placed
on Zosyn on admission. When he was tolerating PO intake, his
antibiotics were changed to oral Augmentin.

Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely; he received 2 units of fresh frozen plasma for an INR
of 1.7 in preparation for his ERCP. His coumadin was restarted
on [**11-15**] and his INR was followed. Dosing was adjusted
accordingly.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular
diet, ambulating with the assistance of a walker, voiding
without assistance, and pain was well controlled. The patient
received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with
understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan,
including follow up with his PCP for INR checks and with
cardiology, as well as with surgery.
