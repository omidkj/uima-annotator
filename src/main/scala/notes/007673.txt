Admission Date:  [**2132-7-25**]     Discharge Date:  [**2132-7-29**]


Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypotension.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 85 year-old
female with a history of coronary artery disease status post
four vessel coronary artery bypass graft with a history of
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who lives at a nursing home.
The patient was found to have fevers to 102 degrees
Fahrenheit one day prior to admission with worsening lethargy
for five days prior to admission and decreased oral intake.
The patient was given Levofloxacin and fluids at her nursing
home.  The fluid was discontinued when a subsequent chest
x-ray showed signs of congestive heart failure.  The patient
was then noted by the nursing home physician to have
decreased oxygen saturation and tachypnea to 30 so she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further care.

The workup in the nursing home showed urinary tract infection
with greater then 100,000 E-coli, which were pan sensitive to
Ampicillin, Ceftriaxone and Quinolones.  Chest x-ray there
showed mild congestive heart failure.  The patient had been
admitted most recently in [**2131-3-23**] for rapid atrial
fibrillation and had cardiac enzymes cycled at that time with
a peak creatine kinase of 373 and a peak MB of 96.
Cardiology had seen her at that time and recommended medical
management.  The patient had not been taking her oral
medications for several days prior to admission secondary to
changes in mental status.  In the Emergency Department the
patient had a respiratory rate of 40, heart rate of 88, blood
pressure of 115/80.  The patient received one dose of
Clindamycin and one dose of Ceftriaxone as well as one dose
of Lopressor 2.5 mg intravenous.  On admission to the floor
she was lethargic and in moderate respiratory distress and
100% nonrebreather mask.  Her temperature at that time was
101.8, heart rate 90, blood pressure 160/69 and respiratory
rate of 20.  The patient was in atrial fibrillation.
Laboratory results at that time showed a white blood cell
count of 14.4 with 80% neutrophils, creatine kinase 130, MB 8
and troponin was 1.02.  Chest x-ray on the floor showed small
bilateral pleural effusions.  Urinalysis done in the
Emergency Room showed a pH of 5.0, specific gravity 1.035,
moderate blood, 100 protein, 1000 glucose, trace ketones and
negative for leukocyte esterase.  An electrocardiogram done
on admission showed a rapid rate and an irregularly irregular
rhythm of about 150 beats per minute.  Repeat
electrocardiogram showed a rate of 97 beats per minute with
some ST depressions in leads 2, 3, and AVF of 1 to 2 mm.  A
repeat electrocardiogram showed a reate in the 70s with
improvement of the ST depressions in leads 3 and V6 and a
right bundloid interventricular block.  The patient was given
intravenous Levaquin for her urinary tract infection and
blood cultures were taken.  Her change in mental status was
thought to be secondary to an infection.  She was also given
12.5 mg of Lopressor for rate control with a subsequent heart
rate in the 70s to 80s.  The patient does have a history of
bradycardia secondary to beta blockers.  On the morning of
transfer to the MICU the patient was found to be hypotensive
with a blood pressure of 60/palp and a heart rate of 160.
She was given 5 mg of Lopressor with no improvement.  She was
given 10 mg of Diltiazem with a subsequently heart rate of
130 to 140 and improved blood pressure.  The patient was
given 2 liters of normal saline and was transferred to the
MICU for further monitoring.  Before transfer she was given
an additional 5 mg of Diltiazem to bring her heart rate from
150 to 130.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a [**Hospital3 2558**] resident,
Russian speaking with two daughters.

ALLERGIES:  Benzodiazepines, Neurontin and beta blocker
resulting in bradycardia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was found to have a
temperature of 101.8, heart rate of 90 to 150, blood pressure
of 160/69, respiratory rate 20 on 100% nonrebreather mask.
In general, she was an elderly ill appearing woman very thin
who did not respond to voice, but did open eyes
spontaneously.  On head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination pupils were noted to be 0.5 mm, minimally
reactive, but symmetric.  The patient was noted to have dry
mucous membranes.  Neck revealed a flat jugulovenous pulse,
very stiff neck to movement and difficult to flex.  Lung
examination revealed minimal air movement bilaterally.
Cardiac examination revealed a tachycardic rhythm, which was
irregular with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdominal
examination revealed a soft, nontender, nondistended belly
with positive bowel sounds.  Extremity examination revealed
no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Neurological examination
revealed a high frequency sign, pill rolling tremor and
cogwheel rigidity in all extremities including rigidity of
the neck.  The patient did not respond to voice or commands,
but did move all extremities spontaneously.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION TO THE MICU:  White blood cell
count of 26.2, hematocrit 44.3, platelet count 267, sodium
149, potassium of 3.5, chloride 105, bicarb 31, BUN of 33,
creatinine 0.6, glucose of 166.  Creatine kinase was peaked
at 130 and troponin T peak was 1.4.  Blood cultures times
four were pending.  Chest x-ray at this time showed clear
lungs with slight blunting of the costophrenic angles
bilaterally and diffuse osteopenia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Hypotension:  The patient was initially
hypotensive, which was thought to be secondary to
hypovolemia.  She did not receive fluids overnight.  After 2
liters of normal saline her blood pressure and heart rate did
improve, but she was still hypovolemic by examination with a
urinary output of 20 cc per hour and dry mucous membranes.
The patient's hypotension did not seem to be related to her
rapid ventricular rate as when she was fluid replenished her
blood pressure improved even while her heart rate remained in
the 160s.  The patient was repleted and by discharge was
euvolemic.

2.  Atrial fibrillation:  The patient continued to have
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation throughout her hospital stay.
As per the patient's family the patient did not want a pacer
inserted.  The patient has a history of not responding well
to a beta blocker and therefore she was treated with
Diltiazem prn for several days and continued to have
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rates in the 160s and
170s.  Therefore the patient was started on Amiodarone to
control her rate.  Even on Amiodarone the patient still
required Lopressor and Diltiazem prn to control her rate.

3.  Hypertension:  The patient remained hypertensive
throughout her hospital stay requiring increases in her
hypertension medications.  The patient was placed on
Lisinopril with some improvement in her blood pressure.

4.  Coronary artery disease:  The patient was continued on
aspirin and Lisinopril throughout her stay.  The patient was
noted to have an increase in cardiac enzymes with a troponin
T of 2.49.  This was thought to be secondary to demand
ischemia as opposed to an acute coronary syndrome.  The
patient was initially placed on heparin drip for acute
coronary syndrome, but after consulting cardiology the
heparin wa
