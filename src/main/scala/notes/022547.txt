Admission Date:  [**2142-12-10**]     Discharge Date:  [**2142-12-12**]


Service:  Coronary Care Unit

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 89-year-old
female nursing home resident with a significant history of
hypertension and transient ischemic attack who experienced
the sudden onset of chest pain at 9 a.m. on the morning of
admission.

An electrocardiogram done at the rehabilitation facility
revealed 5-mm ST elevations in leads II, III, and aVF.  She
received aspirin, three sublingual nitroglycerin, and an
additional sublingual nitroglycerin en route to the Emergency
Department via Emergency Medical Service.

The patient was pain free on arrival to the Emergency
Department at [**Hospital1 69**].  An
electrocardiogram done in the Emergency Department confirmed
the inferior ST elevations.  It additionally revealed ST
depressions in V1 through V5 and 1.5-mm ST elevations in
leads D4R.  The patient received [**2139**] of intravenous heparin
and was taken emergently to the Catheterization Laboratory.

Cardiac catheterization revealed 3-vessel disease with (1)
diffusely diseased right coronary artery including a 95%
proximal lesion; (2) 70% proximal left circumflex lesion; and
(3) an 80% second diagonal lesion.

Stenting across the right coronary artery lesion was
unsuccessful.  Rotablation percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty was successful.  Hemodynamics done during the
procedure revealed pseudoconstrictive physiology with a
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 19 mmHg, right atrium
of 17, pulmonary artery diastolic of 21, and a cardiac index
of 3.47, and pulmonary artery mean of 28.

Despite right ventricular involvement of the patient's
infarction, she did not experience any hypotension or
hemodynamic compromise.

After the procedure, the patient was chest pain free and
denied any additional complaints of fevers, chills, nausea,
vomiting, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or
palpitations.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Transient ischemic attack.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Mild restrictive lung disease.
4.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
5.  Osteoarthritis.
6.  History of renal failure and interstitial nephritis in
[**2142-4-24**].
7.  Depression.
8.  Recurrent urinary tract infections.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Diltiazem 240 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Colace 250 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Famotidine 20 mg by mouth at hour of sleep.
4.  Hydralazine 25 mg by mouth q.8h.
5.  Metoprolol 25 mg by mouth twice per day.
6.  Meter-dosed inhaler.
7.  Senna two tablets by mouth at hour of sleep.
8.  Tolterodine 2 mg by mouth once per day.

ALLERGIES:
1.  PENICILLIN (causes swelling)
2.  BACTRIM (causes interstitial nephritis).

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother with coronary artery disease and
deceased from cerebrovascular accident at the age of 45.
Father with diabetes mellitus and cerebrovascular accident in
his 70s.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at [**Hospital3 **].
Of Russian origin.  The patient uses a walker.  The patient
requires assistance with activities of daily living.  No
known alcohol, tobacco, or drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed the patient's temperature was 99 degrees Fahrenheit,
her heart rate was 67, her blood pressure was 146/63, and her
respiratory rate was 20. Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed sclerae were anicteric.  The oropharynx
was clear.  Neck examination revealed elevated jugular venous
pressure.  No bruits.  Heart revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  Increased second heart sound.  Positive third heart
sound.  Lung examination revealed bibasilar crackles.
Abdominal examination revealed positive bowel sounds.  The
abdomen was nontender and nondistended.  The abdomen was
soft.  Extremity examination revealed no cyanosis, clubbing,
or edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratory data
revealed the patient's blood urea nitrogen was 25 and
creatinine was 1.  Complete blood count revealed the
patient's white blood cell count was 8.8, hematocrit was
32.8, and her platelets were 145.  First creatine kinase was
173.  Troponin T was 0.30.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed a
normal sinus rhythm and normal axis.  Normal intervals with
6-mm ST elevations in lead III; 3-mm ST elevations in leads
II and aVF.  Tall R waves with ST depressions in V2 and V3.
There were 2-mm ST elevations in D4R.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient tolerated cardiac
catheterization well with the results as described in the
History of Present Illness.  Her creatine kinase levels
peaked at 1768 and continued to trend down throughout the
rest of her stay.  She was initiated on aspirin, Plavix, and
Lipitor.  Her beta blocker was resumed, and an ACE inhibitor
was initiated and titrated aggressively.  The patient
remained without chest pain for the rest of her stay.

2.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient with a history of
restrictive lung disease and evidence of an elevated
pulmonary artery pressure with a mean of 28 during
catheterization.  The patient's pulmonary status remained
stable throughout her stay.

3.  RENAL ISSUES:  The patient's creatinine remained stable
status post dye load an initiation of an ACE inhibitor.

4.  HEMATOLOGIC ISSUES:  The patient had a decreased
hematocrit status post catheterization, but no evidence of a
hematoma or retroperitoneal bleed.  She received one unit of
packed red blood cells.

5.  PHYSICAL THERAPY ISSUES:  The patient was evaluated by
Physical Therapy in anticipation of transfer back to her
rehabilitation facility.  She was maintained on subcutaneous
heparin while in house.

6.  CODE STATUS ISSUES:  The patient was do not
resuscitate/do not intubate at her rehabilitation facility,
but her code status was changed to full code for the cardiac
catheterization procedure.  The patient's code status needs
to be reassessed with the patient and family upon transfer
back to the rehabilitation facility.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged back to [**Hospital3 1761**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Status post acute inferoseptal and right ventricular
myocardial infarction.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Transient ischemic attack.
5.  Restrictive lung disease.
6.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
