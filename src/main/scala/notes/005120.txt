Pertinent Results:
PREBYPASS
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is elongated.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium or left atrial appendage.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45%) with global
mild hypokinesis and severe hypokinesis of the inferolateral
septum.
Right ventricular systolic function is normal with good free
wall contractility.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta
is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
Number of leaflets cannot be determined. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.5 cm2). Moderate (2+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

POSTBYPASS
The patient is AV-paced on a phenylephrine infusion.
Left ventricular systolic function is slightly improved (LVEF =
50-55%) with some septal dyskinesis consistent with ventricular
pacing.
The new bioprosthetic aortic valve is well-seated without
perivalvular leaks or aortic regurgitation. Peak/mean gradients
across the new valve are 14/9 mmHg.
Mitral regurgitation is now mild (1+).
The thoracic aorta is intact.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was informed of the results at the time of the
study.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted on [**9-10**] to complete pre-op w/u.Underwent surgery with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**9-12**]. transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition on titrated phenylephrine and propofol drips. Low dose
epinephrine drip started that evening. Extubated on POD #1.  Had
significant amount of bloody chest tube output and was taken
back to the OR on POD 2 for mediastinal exploration.  He
remained hemodynamically stable and tolerated the procedure
well.  He was again transferred to CVICU for recovery.
POD 1 from re-exploration found the patient extubated, alert and
oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, weaned from
inotropic and vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated
and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative
weight.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were
discontinued without complication.  Labs demonstrated
hypothyroidism, endocrine consult was called and the patient was
started on levothyroxine.  The patient was evaluated by the
physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 7 and 5, the wound
was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.  He
was deconditioned and it was decided to send him to rehab on
discharge.  The patient was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] in
good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
