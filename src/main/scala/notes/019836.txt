History of Present Illness:
This 75-year-old man lives in [**Location 66469**], NY and was
hospitalized there two months ago with pneumonia.  Upon
discharge, he was advised to follow-up with his PCP for repeat
chest imaging to confirm resolution of the pneumonia.  He then
saw his PCP roughly one month ago; plain radiography showed a
clear chest but also disclosed an abdominal abnormality for
which CT was advised.  This CT scan was done 3-4 weeks ago.
Following the CT scan, the patient travelled to [**Hospital3 **] for
vacation as previously planned; he asked to be contact[**Name (NI) **] with
the results of the imaging study but no one called him.

Two weeks ago, he began having significant left-sided abdominal
pain in his lower quadrant and hypogastrum.  This pain was
associated with increasing difficulty passing urine.  The
patient often feels as if he has to void, but he tries to pass
urine and little comes out.  He has dysuria early in the urinary
stream but none otherwise.  Over the past couple of weeks, he
has also had difficulty passing stool; he typically has one
bowel movement daily, but he last had a BM four days ago.  He is
not sure if he is still passing flatus.

The pain became increasingly intolerable over the past several
days, so he sought attention at an OSH where a CT scan
reportedly showed a large (9 x 12 x 18 cm) soft tissue mass in
the area of the lower pole of the left kidney.  A thickened
urinary bladder was also seen; there was no adenopathy.  The
report of the non-contrast CT scan done in NY on [**7-21**] was
subsequently obtained; it shows multiple lobulated masses
forming a conglomerate size of at least 12 x 6.5 cm with
obstruction near the level of the UPJ and dilatation of the
intrarenal collection system and renal pelvis.  Perinephric
stranding but no stones were seen.

Based on the results of these imaging studies, the patient was
referred here for further evaluation and treatment.  On further
review of systems, he reports midline low back pain that has
significantly worsened over the past couple of months.  He
initially received an epidural steroid injection that provided
only three weeks of relief; physiotherapy was then attempted,
again without relief.  He also feels as if his legs have become
weak over the past couple of weeks; he has trouble standing from
a seated position.  He denies numbness, tingling, or pain in his
legs.  He likewise denies saddle anesthesia.

He has had anorexia for the past several weeks, dramatically so
over the past couple of days.  Until 48 hours ago, he had been
forcing himself to eat, but he has eaten very little for the
past two days.  His abdomen has become increasingly bloated over
the past several months.

He denies fevers, chills, night sweats, or weight loss.  He
likewise denies headache, visual changes, blurred or double
vision, sore throat, dysphagia, odynophagia, chest pain,
dyspnea, cough, sputum production, nausea, emesis, diarrhea,
hematochezia, melena, hematuria, myalgias, arthralgias, or rash.

In the ED, a post-void residual was reportedly 300 cc.  A Foley
catheter was placed.  He was given ciprofloxacin 500 mg by mouth
and morphine IV and was admitted to 12 [**Hospital Ward Name 1827**].

Past Medical History:
1. anxiety and panic attacks
2. pneumonia [**5-21**]
3. low back pain
4. colon perforation s/p primary repair [**2145**]

Social History:
He lives in [**Location 66469**], NY with his second wife.  [**Name (NI) **] has six
children (three from his first marriage, three from his second).
 He is an ordained minister.  He was a professor (sociology of
religion) at [**Hospital1 1012**] before retiring; he now volunteers in the [**Location (un) 5426**] prison system educating and reaching out to prisoners.  He
denies tobacco or illicit drug use or abuse.  He has two vodka
tonics daily; his last drink was seven days ago.  His daughter
is the [**Male First Name (un) **] of [**Name (NI) **] business school.

Family History:
His mother died at age 83 of a stroke.  His father died in an
[**Name (NI) 39447**] at age [**Age over 90 **].  Three of his siblings are deceased (brain tumor,
stroke), and his remaining sibling (83 y.o. brother) has
significant coronary disease.  All of his children are well.

Pertinent Results:
OSH labs reportedly showed normal chemistries, liver enzymes,
and coags.  His WBC was 9.0, Hct 37%, and platelets were 460K.

deviation, normal intervals, and poor R wave progression.

OSH CT Report (obtained verbally): small ascites with a small
amount of fluid around the liver; asymmetric enlargement of the
left kidney with a delayed nephrogram and moderate
hydronephrosis and hydroureter; there is a large (12.8 x 9.1 x
18.8 cm) lobulated soft tissue mass encasing the left ureter and
extending into the renal sinus fat of the left kidney; at its
inferior margin, the mass extends into the right hemipelvis
where it displaces the sigmoid colon anteriorly and effaces the
posterior-lateral aspect of urinary bladder in conjunction with
diffuse infiltration of the mesenteric fat and several
subcentimeter retroperitoneal lymph nodes; the  renal vein is
effaced and obscured by the mass; oral contrast passes to the
distal small bowel; there is gas and stool in the colon
extending to the left colon, where the rest of the sigmoid colon
is decompressed secondary to mass effect; there is moderate
distension of the urinary bladder with an irregular wall most
thick at its posterior-lateral aspect; the spine shows
degenerative disease but no worrisome lytic or blastic lesions
