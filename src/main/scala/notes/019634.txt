Allergies:
Bactrim Ds / Hurricaine / Zosyn / Glipizide

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, rash.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
60 yo W w/ hx DMII, R mastectomy, Charcot foot, s/p several
recent ICU admissions transferred from rehab [**11-28**] for fever and
rash, on the floor w/ agitation, [**Month/Year (2) **] responsive to
fluids, now sedated post-haldol, clonazepam, seroquel.
.
Pt was initially admitted for elective foot repair in [**2121-10-28**].
She developed respiratory distress, wound infection, demand
ischemia, and ARF.  She had a 2 day ICU stay.  Her foot was
debrided and she was found to have pseudomonas & MRSA  in her
foot.  She was started on vanco and zosyn.  Additionally,
pulmonary fibrosis was noted on CT of the chest.  Pt was then
transferred to rehab.
.
She returned to [**Hospital1 18**] 12 hrs later [**2-3**] rash, fever, and
[**Month/Day (2) **].  She received 4L fliud and was quickly weaned off a
levophed gtt.  She was in the ICU 4 days again and received a
short course of steroids [**2-3**] low cortisol level in critical
illness setting.  She also had demand ischemia, and also
underwent a TEE to r/o endocarditis, which was negative for
vegetations.  She developed acute methemoglobunemia [**2-3**]
hurricaine spray w/ her TEE and received methylene blue.  She
was continued on vanco and zosyn and had a central line placed
[**2121-11-20**].  Additionally, her screws were removed from her foot
and she was on a Vac dressing.  She was discharged to rehab once
again.
.
She remained at rehab x 4 days, then on [**2121-11-28**] developed rash
and fever (T to 101.8) and was transferred back to [**Hospital1 18**].  She
remained hemodynamically stable on the floor.  Overnight she
became agitated and received haldol, clonazepam, and seroquel.
She was also hypotensive to SBP 70's and responded to 1L NS.
.
On morning of transfer to the MICU, she had SBP's 70-80's got
IVF and her BP responded.  She continues to be seen by ID who
recommended continuing the vanco for a 42 day course for
osteomyelitis, d/cing the Zosyn (?drug reaction), and starting
levo for ?pseudomonas in foot/wound culture (started [**11-30**]).
Rash is thought to be [**2-3**] to a drug (glipizide, lasix, zosyn).
She is now on Vanco for the osteo, eucerin for rash, PICC placed
[**12-2**] (central line removed, ?infection).  Foot wound is being
followed by [**Month/Year (2) **], was recently debrided, XR from [**12-1**] still
question of osteo at medial remnant of tarsal bones
.
On transfer back to the floor, she was stable hemodynamically,
afebrile, at baseline mental status (?uncommunicative, sleepy).

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P
60 yo W w/ hx DMII, osteomyelitis, CRI, CAD, COPD, OSA s/p
repeated hospitalizations now admitted to the ICU w/ rash,
fever, decreased MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **], now stable hemodynamically,
still with rash but afebrile. (Initially admitted to floor,
transferred to MICU overnight, MICU [**Date range (1) 55587**], on floor
[**Date range (1) 55588**])

1. Fever - ddx includes drug fever (given mild eosinophilia)
(?zosyn, lasix, glipizide), line infection, sepsis,
osteomyelitis.  All cultures are NGTD (pseudomoas in foot swab).
 She is currently afebrile and doing better clinically.
?whether residual osteomyelitis on foot XR.  All surveillance
cultures remained negative.  She will continue her course of
Levofloxacin/Vanco (42 days total) until [**2121-12-19**].  Zosyn was
changed to levofloxacin as it was thought that the zosyn may be
causeing her drug fever/rash.  Her SC line was removed, and she
was discharged with a PICC.  [**Month/Day/Year **] debrided the foot wound at
bedside on [**12-1**]. She was continued with her vacuum dressing
(125 mmHG) on discharge, and she will follow up with [**Month/Year (2) **] in
1 week.  The cause of this most recent fever was most likely
drug fever and she remained afebrile throughout her hospital
course.

2.  Rash - Her diffuse, erythematous body rahs was thought to be
a drug reaction.  Her Zosyn, lasix, and glipizide were held, and
her rash did improve throughout hospitalization.  She was less
erythematous, and the rash was desquamating at time of
discharge.  Dermatology saw her in-house, agreed with diagnosis
of drug reaction, and recommended Eucerin cream.

3.  [**Month/Year (2) **] - She was initially hypotensive on presentation
which in part prompted her initial transfer to the MICU.  Her
blood pressure responded to fluids, she was only transiently on
pressors, and her urine lytes were consistent with a prerenal
etiology.  In addition, CVP was low supporting this diagnosis.
Upon transfer back to the floor, her bp was stable, her dose of
lopressor had been decreased, and she remained hemodynamically
stable.

4.  Hyponatremia - resolved with NS hydration. Her Na resolved
to within normal limits after NS hydration.  She was maintained
on a fluid restriction of 1 L; cause of baseline hyponatremia is
unclear, but her baseline seems to be in
