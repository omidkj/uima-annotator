History of Present Illness:
51 year old male with known mitral valve prolapse and mitral
regurgitation followed by serial echocardiograms. Most recent
echocardiogram has shown progression of his mitral regurgitation
to moderate/severe with a flail posterior leaflet. The patient,
complaining of fatigue and some dyspnea on exertion, presents
for surgical evaluation for mitral valve repair versus
replacement.

Pertinent Results:
[**2132-2-11**] Echo: Pre-bypass: The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic
left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed
given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is posterior mitral leaflet
flail at the P2 scallop. An eccentric, anteriorly directed jet
of Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the
eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be
significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). There is no
pericardial effusion. Post-bypass: The patient is receiving no
inotropic support post-CPB. An annuloplasty ring is well-seated
in the mitral position and there is trace valvular
regurgitation. There is a mean transmitral pressure gradient of
3 mm Hg at a cardiac output of 6.3 L/min. There is evidence of
systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral leaflet, but
there is not evidence of outflow tract obstruction or pressure
gradient. Biventricular systolic function is preserved. All
other findings are consistent with pre-bypass findings. The
aorta is intact post-decannulation. All findings were
communicated to the surgeon.

Final Report
CHEST RADIOGRAPH

INDICATION: Evaluation for pleural effusion.

COMPARISON: [**2132-2-12**].

FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of
the
right-sided pleural effusion has minimally increased. As a
consequence, the
right basal areas of atelectasis have also increased. On the
other hand, the
ventilation of the left lung base is slightly improved.

Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette, no evidence of newly
appeared focal
parenchymal opacities indicative of pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit after undergoing all
pre-operative work-up as an outpatient. On [**2-11**] he was brought
to the operating room where he underwent a minimal invasive
mitral valve repair. Please see operative report for surgical
details. Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
 Chest tubes were removed per cardiac surgery protocol.  He was
transferred to the step down unit on post operative day 1 in
stable condition.  He was started on Neurontin with plans for
increased titration as needed due to right medial thigh numbness
and tingling (right groin cannulation.)  He was able to ambulate
and weight bear with this numbness.  He continued to work with
physical therapy to increase strength and endurance.  He was
tolerating a full po diet, ambulating well and his incision was
healing well. His CXR revealed a question of a moderate right
pleural effusion and he had an ultrasound which showed less than
300 cc of fluid and he did not undergo thoracentesis.  He was
encouraged to continue frequent IS use. It was felt that he was
safe for discharge home on post operative day 4.
