HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 89-year-old female,
resident of [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4233**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Nursing Home, with a past medical
his significant for coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass grafting, congestive heart failure,
cerebrovascular accident, hypothyroidism, who presented with
hypoxia and chest pain.

At the nursing home, the patient was found to have hypoxia
with oxygen saturations in the upper 80s, cough, temperature
of 101??????, and the patient was started on Levofloxacin two days
prior to admission for presumed aspiration pneumonia.  The
patient continued to have hypoxia and episodes of chest pain
one day prior to admission which was relieved with sublingual
Nitroglycerin.

On the day of admission, the patient complained of severe
chest pain, as well as shortness of breath, with chest pain
unrelieved with sublingual Nitroglycerin.  In the Emergency
Department, the patient had an oxygen saturation of 82% on
room air and was still hypoxic on nonrebreather.  T-max was
100.6??????.  The patient was given Lasix 40 mg IV secondary to
chest x-ray showing congestive heart failure, possible
multinodular pneumonia, and the patient was started on
Ceftriaxone and Flagyl.

saturation 97% on nonrebreather.  General:  No acute
distress.  HEENT:  Dry mucous membranes.  Pupils equal and

of 6 systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal base.
Chest pain reproducible with palpation on the left side.
Pulmonary:  Somewhat decreased breath sounds.  Scattered
rales.  No wheezing.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 18.4, hematocrit
33.3, platelet count 320; sodium 143, potassium 4.1, chloride
104, bicarb 23, BUN 29, creatinine 1.7, glucose 141;
differential 87.6 neutrophils, 7 lymphocytes, 4.5 monos;
urinalysis clear and yellow, negative ..................,
negative nitrate, 0-2 red blood cells, [**3-23**] white blood cells,
few bacteria, 2 epithelial cells; urine culture pending;
preliminary cardiac enzymes with a CK of 101, MB 2, troponin
less than 0.3; Digoxin level 1.4.

Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly, calcified aorta, perihilar
mid lung zone, bibasilar opacities, upper zone recruitment
vasculature, old bilateral rib fractures.

Electrocardiogram showed left bundle branch block, no change
from prior [**2100-8-17**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with multilobular
pneumonia and congestive heart failure admitted to the MICU
for observation where the patient was noted to be comfortable
with minimal chest pain and no shortness of breath.  The
patient's oxygen saturation improved with decreasing
supplemental requirement, and the patient was felt to be
stable on the second hospital day for transfer to the ACOVE
Service.

1.  Pulmonary/Multilobular pneumonia:  The patient was
continued on Ceftriaxone 1 g IV q.24 hours, Flagyl 500 mg
t.i.d.  Sputum culture was unable to be obtained secondary to
nonproductive cough.  The patient's white blood cell count
continued to trend down with an oxygen saturation improved
with an oxygen saturation of 97% on 3 L nasal cannula.  The
patient was started on chest PT.

2.  Cardiovascular/congestive heart failure:  The patient was
initially continued on her standing dose of Lasix of 40 mg
p.o. q.d.; however, the patient was later felt to be
intravascularly depleted with decreased p.o. intake, and her
Lasix dose was held for several days with no signs of
congestive heart failure.  The patient's chest pain was felt
to be noncardiac in origin given the negative cardiac enzymes
and no changed on electrocardiogram, in addition to the
ability to reproduce the pain with palpation.  She was
continued on her Aspirin, Digoxin, Vasotec, Atenolol, Imdur,
and Procardia.

3.  Musculoskeletal:  The patient had anterior chest wall
pain.  Her pain symptoms were at first attempted to be
managed with Tylenol only; however, the patient continued to
have chest pain, and her symptoms were relieved with
narcotics.  Rib films were done of the left side in order to
evaluate for possible rib fracture; however, these only
showed osteopenia and no acute rib fracture.

4.  GI:  The patient had several episodes of diarrhea and
diffuse abdominal pain.  C-diff was sent which was negative.
KUB showed diffuse gas but no evidence of obstruction.  No
area of focal tenderness was able to be discerned on exam.
The patient's abdominal complaints improved through her
hospital course, and the diarrhea began to resolve.  Her
narcotic treatment was weaned in order to avoid ileus.

5.  Neurological/psychiatry:  The patient had episodes of
agitation and anxiety.  Her Ativan dose was changed from 0.5
mg b.i.d. to 0.5 mg q.a.m., 1 mg q.h.s.  Her Zyprexa was
changed to 2.5 mg b.i.d.  The patient was not found to have
hyposomnolence on these doses, and her agitation was well
controlled.

6.  FEN:  The patient had poor p.o. intake and was
supplemented on intravenous fluids.  Her p.o. intake improved
however over the course of her hospital stay.

It was felt that the patient was stable for discharge back to
her nursing home.  She will be transitioned to p.o.
antibiotics.  She will be evaluated by Physical Therapy.

1.  Multilobular pneumonia.
