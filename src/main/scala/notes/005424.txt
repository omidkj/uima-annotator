Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
"I've been swimming to the left"

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left sided Burr Holes
Left sided craniotomy
tracheostomy [**1-2**] by trauma surgery
PEG tube placement [**1-2**]  by trauma surgery

History of Present Illness:
82yo white,right handed male with significant cardiac hx of 6
vessel CABG, symptomatic Atrial Fibrillation, pacemaker
currently on coumadin/ASA reports that for past 2weeks feels he
is drifting to the left when he swims, gait instability with
leaning to the left, and R.sided h/a with increased extension to
R.temporal region. Pt swims every day and notes he recently
feels as though he is having difficulty with the strokes and
swimming straight in [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. Pt also reported he was showering
yesterday and suddenly felt off balance, falling to the left out
of the tub from a standing position to the ground landing on his
back. Denies striking his head, denies LOC. States the headaches
have been intermittent with some relief from Tylenol, but the
h/a extends further each day x1week. Pt denies any recent
illness, no hx of falls, no N/V, no change of vision, taste or
smell, denies sensory loss or subjective weakness. [**12-22**] pt
sought care from his cardiologist for the above mentioned
symptoms, labwork and head CT were ordered. Head CT showed lg
subacute R.frontal SDH. INR 2.9-pt given 1unit FFP, 5mg IV [**Name (NI) 75481**]
pt then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

STUDIES:
.
[**2151-12-22**] CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST:
There is large right subdural hematoma, measuring up to 2.7 cm
in maximum thickness.  Intermediate density of the hematoma is
likely compatible with subacute chronicity.  There is adjacent
sulcal effacement.  There is leftward subfalcine herniation with
15-mm shift of the midline structures. There is no acute
intracranial hemorrhage or major vascular territorial
infarction.  There is an 8-mm hypodensity in the right basal
ganglia, likely representing lacunar infarction, of uncertain
chronicity.
There is air-fluid level in the left maxillary sinus.  There is
fluid in the right middle ear cavity, and clinical correlation
is advised.  Surrounding soft tissues and osseous structures are
unremarkable.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large right subdural hematoma with associated ipsilateral
sulcal effacement with left-[**Hospital1 **] subfalcine herniation.
Intermediate density of the hematoma likely compatible with
subacute chronicity.  No prior studies available for comparison
to assess interval change.
2. Fluid in the left maxillary sinus and right middle ear.
.
[**2151-12-26**] CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST:
Patient is status post recent trans burr hole evacuation of a
right convexity subdural collection.  A moderate amount of mixed
density extraaxial collection remains overlying the right
cerebral
hemisphere, unchanged from prior exam.  The degree of leftward
shift of
normally midline structures (12 mm) and effacement of the
subjacent sulci is essentially unchanged.  Basal cisterns remain
open.  No new hemorrhage is identified.  Note is made of
equivocal loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white differentiation along the right
frontoparietal cortex,  which may be related to post-surgical
swelling.  An air-fluid level is identified within the left
maxillary sinus. The remainder of the visualized paranasal
sinuses and mastoid air cells remain normally aerated.
Cavernous carotid are heavily calcified.
.
IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of mixed density extraaxial
collection along the right cerebral convexity status post burr
hole evacuation.  Note is made of subtle equivocal loss of
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation along the right frontoparietal
cortex, which may be related to post surgical swelling. If there
is concern of infarction an MR examination or a CTP may be
helpful.
.
[**2151-12-27**] HEAD CT WITHOUT CONTRAST:
FINDINGS:  There is now a drain in the right subdural
collection. The tip
of the catheter appears to extend beyond the subdural space into
the brain with a small amount of surrounding edema. The size of
the hematoma has decreased compared to the prior study. The
degree of leftward shift and subfalcine herniation remains
essentially stable. There is no new hemorrhage, and no change in
degree of sulcal effacement. Subtle area of hypodensity in the
right frontal lobe may relate to post- surgical edema.
.
IMPRESSION:  Interval decrease in size of mixed density along
the right
cerebral convexity status post evacuation and drain placement.
The drain
appears to extend beyond the subdural space into the brain.
Essentially
unchanged the rest of the examination.
.
[**2151-12-30**] Non-contrast head CT.
FINDINGS:  There is interval decrease in the degree of
pneumocephalus compared to previous exam.  Drainage catheter has
been removed in the interim.  The overall thickness of the
extraaxial collection has decreased compared to previous exam
with less underlying sulcal effacement and slightly less
midline shift (displacement of the septum pellucidum to the left
of 6 mm, previously approximately 9 mm). Dural thickening is
present in the right frontal region. No new foci of hemorrhage
are seen.  There is no new ventricular dilatation. Fluid is seen
in the left maxillary sinus and in the left middle ear.  There
is mucosal thickening of the ethmoid sinuses.
.
IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of drainage catheter with decrease
in extra
axial fluid/hematoma size and mass effect.
.
.
[**2152-1-10**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the basal half of
the inferolateral wall. The remaining segments contract normally
(LVEF = 50-55 %). The estimated cardiac index is borderline low
(2.0-2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are nor
