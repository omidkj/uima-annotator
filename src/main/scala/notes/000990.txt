Cardiac Cath: COMMENTS:     1.  Selective coronary angiography
of this right dominant system revealed no flow limiting coronary
disease.  The LMCA contained a 40% ostial lesion but was
otherwise widely patent.  The LAD contained a proximal 40%
lesion just before the takeoff of a large first diagonal branch.
 The apical LAD was small in caliber.  The LCX contained diffuse
plaquing with a 40% lesion after OM2.  THe RCA had diffuse mild
plaquing with slow washout of contast consistent with the
patient's RV pressure elevation.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed evidence of severe pulmonary
hypertension at baseline with mean PA pressure of 41 mm Hg, a
PVR of 605,
and a cardiac index of 2.2 l/min/m2 (Fick).  With 100% oxygen
therapy, the mean PA remained approximately the same at 40mmHg,
but the PVR dropped to 385 and the cardiac index rose to 2.98
l/min/m2.  Little further improvement was seen with Nitric
Oxide: the mean PA dropped slightly to 39mmHg, the PVR rose
slightly to 415, and the cardiac index fell slightly to 2.8
l/min/m2.  In summary, neither oxygen nor nitric oxide
significantly dropped the mean PA pressure, but both therapies
resulted in a modest increase in CO which drove a fall in PVR
compared to baseline.
3.  Left ventriculography was not performed.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No flow limitng coronary artery disease.
2. Mild LV diastolic dysfunction.
3. Severe primary pulmonary hypertension.
4. No change in mean PA pressures with 100% oxygen or Nitric
Oxide.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 13537**] is a 58 year old woman with pulmonary hypertension
who presented with a likely viral gastroenteritis which quickly
resolved. She responded to NO in past on cath [**2135**].  A swan was
attempted on [**2140-11-12**] and was unsuccessful but one was placed at
cardiac cath. She had a right and left heart cath on [**2140-11-14**]
which showed no change from previous. She started sildafenil
after catheterization and was observed. It appeared to have an
effect of 30% or more improvement on her cardiac output but her
pulmonary artery pressures only seemed to decrease transiently.
It was decided that she would benefit from the sildafenil and
was discharged with a prescription and follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

In the emergency department the patient had been transiently
hypotensive in ED secondary to nitroglycerin as the patient is
preload dependent.  It quickly resolved.

In terms of her CAD, Ms. [**Known lastname 13537**] had 50% LMCA stenosis,
otherwise clean Cs.  Her aspirin and statin were continued and
she was restarted on bblocker. TNT elevation was thought likely
secondary to RH strain but not to ACS.

Regarding her acute renal failure, the patient's Cr is 0.8 at
baseline, and 1.3 on admit. This was thought to be prerenal and
resolved with rehydration.

Ms. [**Known lastname 13537**] was anemic with a hct drop 32 to 26 after line
placement. There was no evidence of bleed. She received a unit
of prbcs and following that her hct remained stable. She was
guaiac negative.

The patient has a history of hypothyroidism for which
levothyroxine was continued. She was discharged in her usual
state of health.
