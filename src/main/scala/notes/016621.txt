History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 45 year old woman with a complicated medical
history including aortic root replacement for acortic ectasis in
[**2123-1-23**]. She has had multiple hospitalizations since that
time for wound debridement and superficial sternal infections.

Her course was complicated by a motor vehicle accident, [**12-4**], [**2123**], as an unrestrained driver with airbag deployment,
head-on into a truck at approximately 50-60 mph. The patient
sustained facial and nasal fractures, bruises to chest and
knees. She was evaluated at [**Hospital6 5016**] and was also
found to have a T12-L1 compression spine fracture.

She was admitted to the CT service at [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2123-12-19**] for a
sternal hematoma and was found to have a fluid collection
anterior to the manubrium, with an enlarged pseudoaneurysm
measuring 3.3 x 5.6.

On [**12-22**], the patient was brought to the Operating Room at
which time she underwent an aortic root replacement and coronary
artery bypass grafting times one with SVG-->RCA. She returned to
the OR on [**2123-12-25**] and underwent a clean-out of her chest and
primary closure of her chest. She was discharged on [**2124-1-4**] with
a back brace for her spinal fracture. She was discharged on
Vancomycin 1 g b.i.d., stop date of [**1-30**], Rifampin 300 mg q.8
hours, to be continued indefinately, Gentamicin 100 mg q.8
hours, stop date of [**1-8**]. Following completion of
Gentamicin course, the patient was to start on Levofloxacin 500
mg q.d., and this is to continue indefinitely.

Patient presented to an outside hospital on [**2124-11-4**] with 11
hours of chest pain which was epigastric in character and
associated with nausea and bilious emesis and SOB with exertion.
It occurred suddenly while she was at work. She works as a nurse
at a nursing home in [**Hospital1 487**]. The pain began in the epigastric
area and then spread to her back, shoulders and down her legs.
Last BM was day prior to admission and pt was passing gas. She
reported that her temperature at work was 101. In the ED at [**Hospital 28941**] she was given vancomycin 1 gm and Levaquin 500 IV. She
also got compazine, zofran and morphine. T 100.4 BP 157/70 HR 96
RR 24 O2 98% RA.

Given her history of aortic root replacement she was transfered
to the CSRU at [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation. She underwent a CT
scan which showed no pathology of the aortic root and no
evidence of sternal osteomyelitis. She was noted to have
markedly elevated bilirubin, amylase and lipase. Her rifampin
was held due to concern for hepatitis. She was continued on
vancomycin and levaquin.

On further history she reports that she has been off rifampin
for the past 3-4 weeks as it causes nausea and vomiting. She
restarted it 4 days ago and has had increasing nausea and
epigastric pain since, but on the day of admission the pain was
far worse in nature than prior. The pain was different from the
pain she had with her aortic aneurysm. When the patient first
started rifampin in [**11-28**] she did not tolerate it due to N/V and
also developed mildly elevated transaminases, therefore the dose
was decreased from 800 to 600 and the patient tolerated the
medication better. She has been taking acetominophen and tylenol
but cannot quantify how much.
