Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1515**]
Chief Complaint:
CoreValve placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2126-7-9**] Percutaneous aortic valve replacement (CoreValve)


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 110573**] is a delightful and energetic 82 year old
woman who has known aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation,
osteoporosis, hypertension and diabetes mellitus.  She has been
in reasonable cardiovascular health over the past several years
until 4 months ago when she began to notice increasing shortness
of breath with exertion to the point that she is dyspneic when
walking across the room.  Her initial echocardiogram showed a
mean aortic valve gradient 94 mmHg and peak gradient 135 mmHg.
The aortic valve area was 0.4 cm2.  The LVEF was 65%. Cardiac
catheterization showed insignificant coronary artery disease.
She was referred to cardiac surgery for surgical AVR and was
deemed of extreme risk prohibitive for cardiac surgery due to
calcified aorta. She was referred for screening for
Corevalve/TAVR. She met all inclusion criteria and did not meet
any exclusion criteria. Warfarin was discontinued 4 days prior
to admission. She returned on [**2126-7-8**] for Corevalve/TAVR.

Per signout, the patient tolerated the procedure well.  A
percutaneous transfemoral approach was performed.  A [**Company **]
cardiac CORE VALVE was placed, with rebalooning performed in the
presence with a perivavular leak, with attenuation of the leak
after rebalooning.  The patient had 200 cc's of blood loss with
a drop in HCT from 38 to 30.  2.1L of crystalloid fluid was
provided during the procedure, and PAP's were noted to be around
60mmHg systolic.
Forty mg of IV furosemide was administered with about 600 cc's
of UOP.  Patient noted at baseline to have a less than 1 cm
pericardial effussion that did not increase periprocedurally.
In the CCU, patient is intubated and sedated.

PERTINENT REPORTS:
[**2126-7-8**]   Radiology CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT)
Moderate-to-severe cardiac enlargement, unchanged from [**Month (only) 547**],
without acute chest abnormality or pulmonary edema. No
pericardial effusion was present in [**Month (only) 547**] at which time the
cardiac silhouette was similarly enlarged, and therefore cardiac
enlargement may be the result of  cardiomyopathy

[**2126-7-9**]   Cardiovascular ECHO
Prevalve Implant
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is a very small pericardial effusion. Drs [**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) **] were notified in person of the results on [**2126-7-9**] at
845 am.

Post valve Implant
Corevalve seen in the aortic position. It appears well seated .
There are two perivalvular leaks present. 1- 2 + aortic
insufficiency present. LV function unchanged. Mild to moderate
mitral regurgitation present. Rest of examination is unchanged.


[**2126-7-10**]   Cardiovascular ECHO
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild-moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is
present. The transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis.
Two jets of ? paravalvular aortic valve leak are seen at 7 and 5
o'clock (the first is mild, the second is mild-moderate) in the
short axis view (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). There is no central aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive
filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. There
is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

Compared with the prior study dated [**2126-6-6**] (images reviewed),
a CoreValve prosthesis is now appreciated with normal
transaortic gradients and mild-moderate aortic regurgitation,
likely paravalvular in lo
