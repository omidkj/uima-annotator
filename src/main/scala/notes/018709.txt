History of Present Illness:
76-year-old male with complicated past medical history of dCHF,
PVD, COPD, HTN, esopageal CA s/p esophagectomy who was diagnosed
with bilateral PEs on [**2169-12-22**] and started on anticoagulation who
now presents from OSH with GI bleed.
.
Per the [**Date Range **] summary, the patient was diagnosed with a
bilateral PE on [**2169-12-22**] at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital. He was
started on a lovenox bridge and transitioned to warfarin. Per
report, his INR has remained at goal since that time. Since this
time he has developed pneumonia requiring courses with meropenem
and vancomycin and imipenem.
.
Sometime prior to [**2170-1-18**] he developed frank rectal bleeding with
a hematocrit drop to 23. His anticoagulation was discontinued
and he had ultrasounds done of his extremities. His legs and
left upper extremity were normal. His RUE showed extensive clot
burden and an SVC filter was placed on [**2170-1-18**]. The Hct continued
to trend down and he required transfusion with 2 u PRBC. The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of GIB.
.
Of note, the patient was empirically placed on antibiotics for
pneumonia, however, these were discontinued by the primary
physician prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
The patient notes that he has some shortness of breath and
lightheadedness. He notes an oxygen requirement since his
diagnosis of pulmonary emboli. He denies chest pain, abdominal
pain, back pain or other symptoms. He denies fevers but endorses
cough with some yellow sputum. His last GI bleed was prior to
the weekend per patient report.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST [**2170-1-23**]:
1. Large necrotizing pneumonia, incipient lung abscess, left
upper lobe, probably due to aspiration, given more severe
bibasilar peribronchial infiltration around chronic
bronchiectasis and retained secretions in the bronchial tree.
2. New left hilar adenopathy could be reactive or malignant,
mildly narrows but does not obstruct the upper lobe bronchus.
Mild generalized mediastinal adenopathy, unchanged since [**Month (only) 359**]
[**2166**]. No good evidence for active recurrence of esophageal
carcinoma.
3. Severe emphysema.
4. Gastrostomy balloon at the pylorus might interfere with
gastric emptying.

ART DUP EXT UP UNI OR LMTD RIGHT [**2170-1-25**]: There is no evidence
of arterial stenosis in the right upper extremity.

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US RIGHT [**2170-1-25**]: Non-occlusive DVT in the
axillary and one of the brachial veins. Nearly completely
occlusive thrombus involving the basilic vein.

G/GJ/GI TUBE CHECK [**2170-1-28**]: The tip appears to be in the loops
of the jejunum in the right mid-lower quadrant. No extravasation
of contrast is demonstrated on this limited one static image.

ECG Study Date of [**2170-1-30**]: Sinus tachycardia. Frequent
ventricular ectopy. Left axis deviation. Non-specific ST-T wave
changes. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2169-9-28**] the rate
is faster and ventricular ectopy is new.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) [**2170-1-30**]: The substantial increase in
consolidation in the necrotizing left upper lobe pneumonia that
took place between [**1-22**] and [**1-30**] after left upper
lobe bronchoscopic biopsy, has improved little, but i
