Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
73F with complex medical history including COPD, CKD Stage 3,
PAF s/p ablation on coumadin, diastolic CHF, aortic stenosis s/p
percutaneous valvuloplasty, hypertension, hyperthyroidism on
Methimazole, presenting with abdominal pain at site of abdominal
hernia.
.
Patient presented to [**Hospital6 3105**] the day prior to
admission with complaints of progressively worsening abdominal
pain over the site of a periumbilical hernia (developed in
[**2191**]).  Patient reports that the pain is always present, but
over the last several days, it has become intolerable, [**9-21**] and
constant.  Pain is not relieved with tylenol.  Pain is not
associated with nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or
blood in stool.  She has two solid bowel movements daily, and
last bowel movement was day prior to admission.  She denies
fever or chills.  She denies dysuria, urgency or frequency of
urination.
.
In addition, patient reports worsening exercise tolerance over
the same period of time. She is usually able to walk to the
kitchen without shortness of breath, but now reports dyspnea
when walking "to the table."
.
At [**Hospital6 3105**], patient received Ancef 1000mg IV
to treat abdominal cellulitis.  She also received duonebs for
shortness of breath and morphine IV for pain control.  A CT
abdomen showed no incarceration of the hernia with incidental
finding of lung consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical evaluation of hernia.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were: 97.3 85 133/39 18 100% 3L.
Physical exam was notable for aortic stenosis murmur [**4-17**],
bibasilar crackles with soft expiratory wheeze. Her abdominal
exam was significant for tender peri-umbilical and suprapubic
area with an umbilical hernia, a large pannus with peau d'orange
swelling and erythema in the suprapubic area. Her lower
extremity exam was significant for increased warmth and
erythema. Labs were significant for Cr 1.3, Hct 34.1, INR 1.7
(on coumadin), BNP > 1000 and troponin 0.03. General surgery was
consulted who noted no incarceration of hernia and suggested
admission to medicine for pain control.  A portable CXR
demonstrated bilateral effusions and could not exlude pneumonia.
An EKG demonstrated SR at 78bpm without evidence of STEMI. She
was given 4mg IV morphine x 1 for pain control, and duonebs x2
for relief of shortness of breath. Vitals on transfer were: 98.1
83 134/50 16 94% 3L.
.
On the floor, initial vital signs were T97.7, BP 159/54, HR 79,
95% on 3L, RR 32.  Patient was complaining of ongoing abdominal
pain and shortness of breath.
.
Of note, patient also reports that approximately two weeks ago
she fell off of her couch, landing on the floor.  She called 911
and EMS services evaluated her at home, but did not take her to
the ER.  She has been able to walk without weakness in her
extremities.  She walks with the assistance of a walker at
baseline.
