History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 47097**] is a 38 year old man with h/o OSA on CPAP, HTN, HLD,
anxiety, who was transferred from an OSH s/p intubation for
hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Patient presented to the OSH yesterday with worsening shortness
of breath. Per the patient's girlfriend, the patient has been
ill for the past 2-4 weeks. He has seen several doctors and was
[**Name5 (PTitle) 75629**] with bronchitis and URI, given Albuterol inhaler and
steroid taper. Three days prior to admission, he had to leave
from work because he was feeling ill. Two days ago, he was
having difficulty breathing while walking around the mall with
his girlfriend. [**Name (NI) **] finished the prednisone taper the day prior
to presentation. Yesterday, the patient was increasingly short
of breath at rest, so his girlfriend dropped him off at the
[**Hospital6 3105**] ED. In the OSH ED, patient was
initially satting 72% on RA, up to 98% with 3LNC. Initial CXR
showed cardiomegaly, but otherwise was unremarkable. The patient
was awaiting bed availability/admission to cards for further
evaluation of CP and SOB with EKG showing TWI in inferolateral
leads and ST depressions in V2-5. He was noted to be obtunded
this AM while satting 99-100% on CPAP/FiO2 75% and could not be
aroused. ABG done at that time showed pH 7.05, pCO2 170, pO2 99.
He was intubated at this point - intubation was difficult [**1-20**] to
anatomy and required 2 operators. Post-intubation CXR with
diffuse air-space disease, concerning for ARDS vs pulmonary
edema, with no clear consolidations. Flu swab was negative per
OSH. Patient was given a dose of Levaquin, duonebs, IV
Solumedrol, Vecuronium, started on Propofol gtt, and transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED via [**Location (un) **]. Patient was bolused with Fentanyl
during the flight because sedation noted to be light.

In the ED, patient noted to be agitated on Propofol gtt, so was
bolused Propofol 50mcg. Initial gas 7.38/68/68 on 100% FiO2.
Labs notable for WBC 14. Repeat gas 7.51/47/75 on 100% FiO2 and
PEEP 5. Bedside ECHO showed no e/o RHS. CTA chest prelim read
with no e/o large PE. Sedation changed from Propofol to
Midazolam given decreased BP in the ED. Also re-dosed with
Vecuronium prior to the CTA chest. Patient was given Vanc,
Flagyl (in addition to Levaquin that he received at the OSH).
Also given a dose of Tamiflu. Blood and urine cultures drawn,
flu swab sent. Vitals prior to transfer: HR 60 BP 115/88 RR 24
O2sat 100% on mechanical ventilation.

On the floor, the patient is intubated and sedated. FiO2 now
down to 50% with increased PEEP to 12.

STUDIES:
[**2145-10-23**] CXR:
1. Intubated patient with the tip of the endotracheal tube 2.3
cm from the
carina; this might be withdrawn for optimal positioning.
2. Low lung volumes with left greater than right basilar
opacities, likely
atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded.

CXR [**2145-10-26**]:
FINDINGS: Bilateral lung volumes are low. Right lower lung
atelectasis has
improved, but there is new minimal fluid in the right minor
fissure.
Increased retrocardiac density reflecting left lower lung volume
loss is
unchanged. Both upper lungs are clear. Endotracheal tube and
orogastric tube are in standard position. No evidence of pleural
effusion.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.


[**2145-10-23**] CT chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of PE or acute aortic injury.
2. Bilateral opacification may represent aspiration versus
pneumonia in the current clinical setting versus bibasilar
atelectasis associated with lower airway inflammation. Some
tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearance, especially within the right lung may
represent reactive/small airway disease or an infectious process
involving small airways.

TTE [**2145-10-25**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
