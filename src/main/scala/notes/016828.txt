Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for pacemaker evaluation.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PPM/Generator placement [**2100-12-10**]


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 82030**] is a 78 year-old man with a history of chronic
atrial fibrillation and bradycardia, s/p permanent pacemaker on
[**2100-11-1**] who presents on transfer from OSH for evaluation for
epicardial pacemaker.
Recently hospitalized ([**10-24**] - [**11-9**]) at an OSH with bradycardia
and UTI. Initially treated with a temporary pacer wire with
subsequent placement of a PPM on [**11-1**]. After discharge to rehab
he was noted to have increasing errythema, itchiness and warmth
at the PPM site, followed by drainage and dehiscence. Also noted
to have weakness, fatigue and hypoxia (O2 87% on room air).
On [**11-25**], he presented to an OSH with weakness, nausea and
purulent drainage coming from a dehisced pacemaker implant wound
with chills and found to have MRSA sepsis vs. bacteremia
(unclear from records). Given this, his pacemaker was explanted
and at that time was noted to have pus inside the pocket. Since
that time he has been on vancomycin with last positive blood
culture on [**2100-11-26**].
Currently his underlying rhythm is afib at a rate of 35. Given
this, a temporary external pacemaker was placed via his right IJ
(unsure if screwed in) and is pacing almost 100% at 63bpm, with
ma of 10, [**Last Name (un) 36**] of 1.5.
He has been referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for epicardial pacemaker placement
by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 914**].
He was initially brought to the floor, but was transferred to
the ICU given temporary pacer wire. The patient was NAD, VS were
96F, 100/57, 60, 25, 88% 3L NC. Pacer capturing at 10amps. He
was A&Ox3, denied SOB, CP, weakness, chills, fever, n/v.

On further review of systems, he denies any prior history of
stroke, TIA though there is a reported history of pulmonary
embolism. Cardiac review of systems is notable for dyspnea on
exertion after walking ~50 feet at baseline.

Brief Hospital Course:
78M admitted from OSH with MRSA sepsis and pacemaker infection,
transferred for epicardial pacemaker placement. [**2100-12-10**]
Mr.[**Name13 (STitle) 82030**] went to the OR and underwent placement of epicardial
leads and PPM generator via subxiphoid approach. Please refer to
operative report for further details. He was transferred to the
CVICU, hemodynamically stable, but remained intubated overnight
due to oxygen requirements. POD #1 he was extubated and
continued to do well.  EP interrogated the PPM. CXR showed good
lead placement. He was transferred to the SDU later that day. He
continued to progress except for difficulty with swallowing.
Speech and swallow was consulted and nectar thickened diet per
reccommendations was instituted. Video swallow test was done on
[**2100-12-14**]. Speech and swallow added pureed solids to his diet.
ID continues to follow. Vancomycin x 4-6 weeks per ID
reccommendations required PICC line insertion. Mr.[**Name13 (STitle) 82030**] was
also placed on Ceftriaxone for a Proteus resistant UTI. His
foley catheter was d
