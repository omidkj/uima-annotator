History of Present Illness:
67yo F reports undergoing multiple repairs of ventral hernias

hernias.

Brief Hospital Course:
     67yo female was admitted to the Minimally Invasive Surgiery
(MIS) service post-operatively on [**2175-8-15**].  Please see operative
report for details. In brief, laparoscopic hernia repair was
attempted but converted to open repair due to incarcerate small
bowel in the hernia.  After dissection of the incarcerated bowel
off the mesh, an area of ischemic bowel was appreciated,
resected, and anastamosed primarily.  Plastic surgery consult
was obtained intra-operatively for assistance with closure and a
component release procedure was performed.  2 JP bulbs were left
in as drains.
     Neuro: initially on propofol while intubated, subsequently
treated with morphine and later roxicet.  Occassional agitation
was treated with haldol.
     Cardiovascular: HTN treated with lopressor and hydralazine.
 After a desaturation episode, an EKG was suspicious for ST
changes but cardiac enzymes were cycled and negative.
     Respiratory: Post-operatively the pt remained in the PACU
and intubated.  She was successfully extubated on POD 1 but
subsequently developed respiratory distress on POD 2 and was
re-intubated.  She was then transferred to the SICU and followed
with the ICU team.  She proved very difficult to wean off the
ventilator, probably due to her smoking history and
COPD/emphysema, and ultimately underwent a percutaneous
tracheostomy on [**2175-8-21**], POD 6.  Ultimately she was able to
tolerate a vent wean bu POD 18, remained on trach collar x48h,
and was transferred to the floor.  There an episode of
respiratory distress, tachypnea, and desaturation was relieved
with suctioning, presumably due to mucous plug, and she was
returned to the ICU.  Vent supported overnight and returned to
trach collar by the next day.  A pulmonary consult was also
obtained.  She continued to receive chest pt, inhalers and
nebulizers.  A speech/swallow consult provided a Passy-Muir
valve and she successfully passed a bedside swallow evaluation.
     GI/FEN: initially kept NPO but diet was later begun with
promote with fiber, advanced easily to goal, via a dobhoff
nasogastric tube.  After passing swallow exam, begun on PO
diabetic diet.
     GU: Foley d/c'd on POD 20 and pt voided successfully.  UTI
treated with levaquin.
     Heme: Progressive hematocrit fall down to 24, treated with
transfusion to maintain Hct > 30.  No evidence for any bleeding
was found.  Hematology consult was obtained although hemolysis
work-up was negative and deemed possibly secondary to chronic
disease and phlebotomy.
     ID:  A fever spike on POD 9 prompted a pan-culture, which
revealed a UTI, and broncheoalveolar lavage, which demostrated
HFlu pneumonia.  Levaquin was started for 14days beginning POD
11.  Although she continued to have secretions, no further
fevers or elevated WBCs were observed.
     Wound: Plastic surgery continued to follow the patient
post-operatively.  JP drains were maintained with plan to remove
once the output was zero; drain #1 was removed on POD 22 while
drain #2 remains in place with scant daily output.  Wound
necrosis between the paramedian incision and her prior midline
occurred and was treated with wet-to-drys and later with
silvadene cream.
     Endo: RISS well controlled and added NPH upon initiation of
TF and diet.
     Rehab: Underwent evaluation by PT/OT services and received
care throughout her hospital stay.
     Prophylaxis: received pneumoboots, sq heparin, and GI
prophylaxis throughout the hospital stay.
     On POD 21 the patient was transferred from the ICU to the
floor after remaining on trach collar successfully for 24 hours.
 She did well overnight and was planned for discharge to vent
rehab on POD 22.
