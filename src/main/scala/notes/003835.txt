Status Asthmaticus
Bilateral Sub-segmental PE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- needle decompression & bilateral chest tubes placed at outside
hospital, removed during stay at [**Hospital1 18**]


History of Present Illness:
27 year old female with a pmh of asthma BIBMS for asthma attack.
EMS attempted intubation in the field which failed. On arrival
to OSH, she lost pulse and went into PEA arrest. She was
resuscitated with CPR for 8 minutes with SROC. She was
intubated, and had bilateral needle decompression with air
return on the left (Per OSH ED report, US showed air on left,
unclear why chesttube placed on right). Bilateral chest tubes
were placed and the order of events is unclear. She was
initiated with arctic sun protocol and paralyzed with rocuronium
for the med flight to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and
treatment. Upon arrival, post arrest team was consulted and
recommended cooling, however the patient was awake and
responsive in the ED responding to commands with normal vital
signs. Cooling was stopped.
.
In the ED she received propofol gtt, fentanyl gtt and fentanyl
bolus. IV access is 3 PIVs HR 79, BP 107/58, Sat 100% on 50%
fio2 PEEP of 8 450 14. Lactate 2.5. She was admitted to MICU,
was extubated the following day. IP removed chest tubes, but
heard small leak on right side, portable film showed residual
small PTX on right, but satting well (high 90s). Serum HCG was
negative. Recieved nebs and steroids. Pred 40 (quick taper over
5-7 days given lungs clear right now), repeat CXR given concern
for persistant right PTX. She underwent CT scan with ? bullae on
imaging.
.
On floor, she is in good spirit, reports some pain b/l at her
breast and back. Reports prior to her admission, she had
worsening SOB, using albuterol inh 4-5x per day (baseline [**1-17**]

once this past week prior to her worsening respiratory
condition.

CXR [**2117-8-29**]
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
change. No evidence of pneumothorax. The small retrosternal air
collection
documented on a CT from [**8-28**] is, with knowledge of this
CT, visible on the lateral chest film. The air inclusions in the
soft tissues are not
apparent radiographically. Minimal left apical atelectasis.
Unchanged
band-like thickening along the right minor fissure. Unchanged
size of the
cardiac silhouette. No newly appeared focal parenchymal
opacities.
.
.
CTA Chest:
1.Pulmonary artery embolism involving bilateral segmental and
subsegmental
branches as described. Main pulmonary artery is free of filling
defects and there is no heart strain or pulmonary infarct.

2.Subcutaneous emphysema along the left axilla and chest wall as
well as trace pneumomediastinum likely from recent chest tube
removal or placement.


Brief Hospital Course:
27 year old female with a pmh of poorly controlled asthma and
frequent flares who presents s/p PEA arrest secondary to status
asthmaticus +/- bilateral PTX.
.
# Respiratory distress: She presented from an OSH with bilateral
chest tubes after needle decompression. She was intubated, and
received solumedrol IV now on oral Prednisone taper. She is now
s/p extubation and satting well on RA. Chest tubes d/ced by IP
yesterday, some concern for small residual PTX on the right but
recent CXR demonstrate no concerning PTX at this time. Dressings
c/d/i.
- History of asthma requiring 2 previous trips to the ED for
treatment. Most recent exacerbation was "a few months ago."
Lately, patient did say that there has been a construction site
near her house and she has noticed her asthma worsening, using
her inhalers during past week. She notes dust that covers
everything in her house.
- Patient also had bilateral subsegmental PE in RUL, RLL, LUL, L
lingula demonstrated by CTA. Patient has reported allergic rxn
to shellfish, gets anaphylaxis, so initiated
pred/benedryl/cimetidine protocol prior to obtaining CT
