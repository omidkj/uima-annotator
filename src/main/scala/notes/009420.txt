History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 48 yo with h/o of COPD/asthma who presented to ED
with dyspnea. He has had progressively worsening symptoms of his
COPD/asthma for the last 1.5 years with 2-3 hospital admissions
(none here). He recently was seenin an ED for similar symptoms
and was treated with a 3d steroid burst + azithromycin. 2 days
after he finished the steroid his breathing significantly
worsened. On the night prior to admission, he was severely
dyspneic + light-headed so he presented to the ED. At that time,
he denied fevers,chills, but had a dry cough, HA. He denied
rash, arthralgias, myalgias, sick contacts.
.
On initial presentation peak flow could not register. initial VS
96.9, HR 105-110, 159/90, 94% on RA & tachypneic + respiratory
distress. He was placed on continuous nebs, was given 125mg Iv
solumedrol steroids, CTX & levoflox for LL pneumonia on CXR.
Based on ABG 7.27/73/46 he was given Mag. On Bipap 10/5. Feels
better on Bipap. tidal volumes near 600.
RR 24, 99% on 10L humidified oxygen. HR 100. don't know where he
gets care. from [**Hospital3 635**].
.
ICU course:
He was weaned of his BIPAP by noon the next day and placed on 4L
NC, on which he satted 92-97%. His solumedrol was continued and
he was given q1 hr albuterol and ipra prn. His acidosis slowly
improved as did his hypercarbia. He did, however, have an
increase in his lactate from 2.1 in the ED to 5.7 during his ICU
stay. It then trended down successively, most recently 3.3. He
was continued on levofloxacin, though his CXR was read as no
pna. He has been afebrile throughout his stay. Flu returned
negative.
.
Upon evaluation, he denied SOB and his only complaint was
ongoing HA and back pain (chronic) and anxiety.

[**2153-5-15**] CXR: PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
Cardiomediastinal contours appear normal. The pulmonary
vascularity also appears normal. The lungs are clear. No
pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is seen. The bony
thoracic cage appears intact.
IMPRESSION: No pneumonia seen.
.
CT chest - IMPRESSION:
1. Severe emphysema.
2. Left lower lobe atelectasis.
3. Borderline enlargement of the main pulmonary artery which may
suggest
underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
.
EKG - Sinus rhythm with slowing of the rate as compared to the
previous tracing  of [**2153-5-18**]. There is ST segment elevation in
leads V1-V4, new as compared to the previous tracing of [**2153-5-18**].
Rule out active ischemic process. Followup and clinical
correlation are suggested.


Brief Hospital Course:
48 yo man with h/o asthma/COPD presenting with dyspnea and found
to have LLL pneumonia and likely asthma exacerbation.
.
# Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory failure:
Hypercarbia/respiratory acidosis appears to be acute as
bicarbonate only minimally elevated.  Most likley due to
asthma/copd flare.  No pneumonia seen on CXR and patient without
productive cough.  He was admitted to the MICU with initial need
for BIPAP, but was weaned off on morning of admission after
hypercarbia improved.  Over the course of the day, he was
monitored and given scheduled nebs and solumedrol with
resolution of his respiratory failure. Patient was then
transitioned to oral prednisone with standing nebs and was able
to be weaned off of oxygen to room air. Patient completed a
course of Levofloxacin for possible pneumonia. Patient being
discharged on maximal COPD regimen including advair inhaler,
combivent QID and advise to quit smoking.
.
# elevated lactate now resolved: unclear precipitant.
Differential diagnosis is broad and includes infectious vs.
medication related vs. secondary to hypoxia on admission.
Patient is on multiple psychiatric medications which may have
contributed however per the patient there is no change in his
regimen. Most likely etiology is related to transient hypoxia.
Lactate normalized. UA negative. Blood cultures are no growth to
date. CT scan without evidence of pneumonia. Blood cultures are
no growth to date, urine culture no growth.
.
# HTN: patient is hypertensive on the floor, patient not
maintained on outpatient medication. Suspect that element of
hypertension secnodary to hypoxia and respiratory status so
would defer starting anti-hypertensive medication in house.
Defer to PCP for initiation of anti-hypertensive if medically
necessary.
.
# anxiety/psych: Serum tox screen was negative and then repeat
serum tox was positive for benzodiazepines after giving patient
benzos in house. Psychiatry was consulted given patient
agitation and desire to leave prior to being medically ready.
Initially placed on CIWA scale which was discontinued as per
psych as there was no evidence of withdrawal.
.
# Acute renal failure now resolved - patient with ARF with Cr
1.3 from baseline level of 1.0 now resolved back to baseline. UA
and urine culture without evidence of infection.
.
# FEN/GI: regular diet, replete lytes PRN, folate, thiamine, mvi
while in house
.
# PPZ: PPI while on steroids, heparin sQ, bowel regimen PRN
.
# Access: PIV
