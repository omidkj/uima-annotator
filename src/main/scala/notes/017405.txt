Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7934**]
Chief Complaint:
Altered MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M w/ PMH multiple mylemoa, with Plasmacytoma of left
clavicle dx in [**6-18**] s/p xrt (last ~[**8-26**]) with recent admission
([**Date range (3) 110715**]) for dehydration and PNA presents with one day
of altered MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. Pt recently returned home from
rehab 5 days ago after completing treatment for PNA with
Vanc/Zosyn.
.
In ED, found to be hypotensive to 90's systolic which was
responsive to fluids.  Also febrile, w/ T 101.  Labs notable for
Hct down to 25 (from baseline 28-30), Cr elevated to 2.4 (from
baseline 1.1-1.3), elevated trop/CKs.  Pt was trace Guiac + on
exam.  CXR showed improved left upper lobe opacity.  In [**Name (NI) **], pt
received 2.5 L NS and one unit PRBC.  Pt received one dose of
Vanc and 1 dose zosyn.  His ECG showed inferolateral ST
depressions.  Cardiology was called and felt that his troponin
leak was due to septic shock and not an acute MI - they
recommended treatment for [**Name (NI) **].  He was then transferred
to the floor.  Shortly after arriving on the floor, his BP
dropped into the 70's systolic and MICU eval was requested.  On
arrival he was found to have SBP in the 70's and to be minimally
responsive.  His sats were in the low eighties.  An ECG was
repeated and he again had inferolateral ST depressions.  He had
one piv.  NS was agressively started and a second PIV was placed
and fluids given.  He was put on a NRB and Sats were in the mid
nineties, and  a gas showed adequate oxygenation and
ventilation.  His blood pressure did not respond to IVF so he
was started on Levophed through his lt. piv awaiting MICU
transfer.


Past Medical History:
Past Onc Hx
The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 410**] for a left clavicular
mass in [**6-18**]. The patient had a history of fx in the left
humerous. In early [**2196**], he developed a mass in his left
shoulder. At first this was thought to be a deformity
post-fracture but it continued to grow so it was decided to
biopsy it. On needle biopsy [**2196-6-23**] the mass was found to be a
plasmacytoma. An SPEP was done that showed an IgA lambda
monoclonal protein and lambda light chains in the serum, a 24
hour urine and UPEP revealed that the patient excreted about
7300 mg per day of light chains per day. He was originally
treated with decadron in [**6-18**]. He was being treated with XRT
(last ~[**8-26**]).

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with MMP including multiple myeloma, with
Plasmacytoma of left clavicle , s/p recent admission for
dehydration and pna (d/ced [**2196-9-8**]) who was readmitted with
[**Month/Day/Year **] and 1 day MS changes.  On presentation to floor, pt
hypotensive, low grade fever, unresponsive, therefore got MICU
evaluation and pt was transferred to MICU. Upon transfer to the
MICU, patient was intubated, started on levophed, and started on
vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl for antibiotic coverage.
Approximately 24 hours after admission, patient developed
tachycardia and [**Month/Day/Year **] with mottled and cool extremities.
[**Name (NI) **] son (his HCP) was called with initial decline in vital
signs and pt's code status was then changed from full code to do
not administer CPR. Patient then received a total of 3L NS,
levophed was increased, 3 amps bicarb were administered, patient
was started on dopamine, and patient was administered
epinephrine. Patient's BP then diminished to 0 and heart rhythm
was PEA. Time of death was called at 12:15am on [**2196-9-29**].
