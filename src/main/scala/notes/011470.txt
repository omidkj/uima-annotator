Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
IPH/SAH s/p fall


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
75 yo M (RHD) transferred from OSH w/ IPH/SAH (posterior R
parietal) s/p unwitnessed fall. Pt reports 2-3 days of dizziness
and "wooziness" during which he has been unable stand w/o
feeling
that he would fall over. On the morning of admission pt reports
falling twice while trying to get out of bed. After both falls
he
was able to pull himself back into bed. He denies loosing
consciousness during either event but does recall hitting his
head both times (on his forehead). Later in the morning he was
unable to get out of bed and had to be helped by his [**Hospital3 12272**] personnel due to generalized weakness (L>R). Pt was taken
to OSH where CT head demonstrated a moderate sized (~3 cubic cm)
IPH into the R posterior parietal lobe w/ SAH extension. Pt was
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
On presentation to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name (NI) **], pt slightly confused (oriented
to self and date) and agitated. Shortly after arrival, pt became
severely agitated and received 1mg of Haldol prior to being
evaluated by neurosurgery. Pt was largely unable to give clear
HPI and much of the above was obtained from OSH records and from
fragments of conversation. Pt's PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] for further
information and no family members were readily available.


Past Medical History:
PMHx: narcolepsy (w/o cataplexy), COPD, asbestos exposure,
hemorrhoids, nephrolithiasis, cholelithiasis, Lumbar spinal
stenosis, ?AAA (recorded in PCP records but no info re Rx,
mgmnt,
or surgery)


Social History:
The patient lives alone, is divorced.  His
primary contact is his son [**Name (NI) 25368**] [**Name (NI) 94865**] (78) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 94866**].  He
smokes 1.5ppd and drinks once per year.


Family History:
No strokes or brain bleeds.  Father had an MI, no
other MIs.

~2mm bilaterally. Visual fields are full to confrontation.

[**Doctor First Name 81**]: Sternocleidomastoid and trapezius normal bilaterally.
XII: Tongue midline without fasciculations.

Motor: Normal bulk and tone bilaterally. No abnormal movements,
tremors. Strength full power [**5-21**] throughout RUE. LUE w/
occasional spontaneous movements of digits. LUE neglect (pt

shoulder and occasionally L elbow with noxious stimulus. No
pronator drift in R.

Pt notably weaker in LUE and LLE (asymmetric) but there is a
large degree of weakness in R side as well.
Pt initially raised his RUE when asked to "show me your Left
hand." However, when corrected and the question repeated, pt was
able to raise his L hand and arm.

Sensation: Intact to light touch in R-side but absent from lower
2/3rds of RUE and in RLE (no response to noxious stimuli). Pt
moves R hand to noxious stimuli in his L axilla but no mvmnt in
his LUE.

IMAGING:
CTA Head [**1-2**]:
IMPRESSION: Right parietal parenchymal hematoma with adjacent
subarachnoid
hemorrhage, similar to recent head CT. No evidence of underlying
vascular
anomaly, no evidence of active contrast extravasation. The
location and
adjacent subarachnoid hemorrhage are most suggestive of cerebral
amyloid
angiopathy. However, continued followup is advised to more
definitively
exclude an underlying mass, which could be obscured by blood
products and
adjacent edema.

MRI Head [**1-2**]:
IMPRESSION: Limited exam demonstrating right parietal
parenchymal hemorrhage as seen on CT, not further characterized.
If desired, the exam can be repeated when the patient's
condition stabilizes.

CT Head [**1-2**]:
IMPRESSION: Right parietal parenchymal hematoma with adjacent
subarachnoid
hemorrhage, similar to the recent CT. The appearance remains
most suspicious
for cerebral amyloid angiopathy. As noted on the prior
examinations,
continued followup is suggested to ensure there is no underlying
mass.

MRI [**1-4**]:
Redemonstration of right parietal lobe hemorrhage, with
subarachnoid extension, without clear identification of a source
for the
hemorrhage. See above report for additional findings.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the NSurg ICU for close observation
and further work up of this brain hemorrhage.  A CTA was
performed which did not reveal AVM or aneurysm. He was loaded
with dilantin for seizure prophylaxis, and his SBP was kept
below 140. A neurology consult was obtained to help discern
between mass with hemorrhagic conversion, or a true CVA.

On [**1-2**] the patient was found to have a focal left arm seizure
- a stat Head CT was performed which showed no change in the
size of the hemorrhage. Keppra was added for increased seizure
prophylaxis.

An MRI with and without contrast was obtained on [**1-4**], which
did not reveal a mass.  The decision was made to transfer care
to the neurology service for further evaluation and management
of this hemorrhagic stroke. He was seen by speech and swallow
who determined that he was aspirating fluids and solids, so he
was made NPO, and all medications were changed to IV. He
underwent PEG placement. He developed stridor and respiratory
distress while on the floor, for which a code was called and he
was intubated and transferred back to the Neuro ICU. Vocal cords
were visualized while in ICU and noted to be edematous, likely
from trauma during PEG procedure. He failed extubation twice;
despite attempts with racemic epinephrine and steroids.
He ultimately required trach. He had left upper extremity
swelling and was found to have a large extensive DVT in left UE,
so was started on Coumadin and Lovenox bridge.  He had a PICC in
the left UE which was removed.

He was transferred to step down on the neurology service over
the weekend.  However, on Monday [**2201-1-19**] he developed respiratory
distress with tachypnea to 40s, desaturation, SBP to 215. He
also spiked a temp to 102 and  had a rising WBC. ABG was
7.5/35/81. CXR showed midline trach and no white out.  Possibly
mucus plugging or pneumonia.  A stat medicine consult was
obtained, and he was transferred to the MICU for further
management.
