CT abdomen [**2123-9-21**]:
IMPRESSION:

1. 2mm obstructing stone in the right distal ureter causing
right sided hydronephrosis and hydroureter.
2. Distended and edematous gallbladder with amorphous
intraluminal material likely representing sludge and stones.
While the appearance could represent acute cholecystitis in the
correct clinical context, the presence of anasarca and ascites
raise the possibility of hypoalbuminemia as a cause for this
appearance. Please correlate clinically . If clinical concern
persists further evaluation with Hidascan is recommended.
3. Left pleural fluid collection and suggestion of split pleura
sign raise suspicion for empyema. Chest CT is recommended.
4. Ascites and anasarca.

US RUQ [**2123-9-22**]:
IMPRESSION: Distended gallbladder containing sludge and stones.
Thickened, edematous wall and pericholecystic fluid are
consistent with acute cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the surgical service, maid NPO, was
given IVF, and was started on antibiotics for a UTI and
suspected cholecystitis.  The patient went to the operating
room, where a gangrenous gall bladder was discovered, with free
fluid in the abdomen.  She was transferred to the intensive care
unit on a ventilator.  She received 2 units of pRBCs for a post
op hematocrit of 27.  She was continued on levo/flagyl.  On post
op day 1, a vent wean was begun, and recieved fluid bolus for
marginal urine output.  The patient had a desaturation on psot
op day 2 during the vent wean, and required an increase in the
PEEP and FIO2.  She was extubated later on post op day 2, after
diuresis.  ON post op day 3, the patient did well with excellent
diuresis, and was started on her home medications for blood
pressure control.  On post op day 4, the patients diet was
advanced to diabetic and she was transferred to the floor.  Her
JP was discontinued on post op day 5.  She was continued on a 2
week course of levofloxacin, and was in stable condition for
return to her living facility.  She resumed taking all
medications she was taking at her [**Hospital3 **] facility prior
to this admission.
