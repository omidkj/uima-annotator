asthma.  Patient was then transferred to UCSD and was diagnosed
with TBM.  Patient had polyflex stents placed (y stent).
Patient was emergently intubated and trached ([**9-6**], 11
rouche) when granulation tissue occluded the proximal end of his
stent.  At that time, the patient was hospitalized for 5 months.
 Patient reports that his last stent change was [**6-7**].  has had
multiple bronchoscopies over past 2 months for thick secretions.
 Has been treated twice with IV vancomycin for MRSA (last dose
[**7-22**]).  Patient reports thick yellow secretions with small

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**7-24**], the pt underwent flexible bronchoscopy.  The pt's stent
was seen to terminate in the proximal bronchus intermedius with
complete occlusion of the right upper lobe. The patient
underwent rigid bronchoscopy and stent removal [**7-25**].  He
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 7
following the procedure for continued monitoring.  The patient's
sputum on [**7-27**] and later bronchial washings ([**8-1**]) were positive
for MRSA, and the pt was placed on vancomycin.  On [**7-30**], the
patient underwent a repeat flexible bronchoscopy, again showing
severe TBM, but decreasing granulation tissue.  Tracheoplasty
was scheduled for the next week. The patient chose to stay in
hospital to await his surgery due to concerns for his
tracheostomy care and for pain management.  Pain management was
a concern throughout his hospitalization as he required high
doses of narcotics both preoperatively and postoperatively to
control his pain.  Both the acute pain service and the chronic
pain service were consulted.

On [**7-31**], the pt underwent another bronchoscopy for mucus
plugging.

The preoperative evaluation for tracheoplasty included airway
evaluation along with the typical workup.  CT airway
demonstrated marked TBM with fixed narrowing of the mid and
distal left bronchus and ground glass opacities.  The Chest CT
demonstrated marked tracheobronchomalacia.  Small airways were
not involved.  PFTs were ordered, but were unable to be
completed due to the pt's tracheostomy.  [**Last Name (un) **] endocrinologists
were consulted for poor glucose control.  [**Last Name (un) **] continued to
manage the pt's diabetes throughout his preoperative and
postoperative course.

On the evening of [**8-5**], the pt's potassium was 6.4.  The pt was
asymptomatic, and no EKG changes occurred.  The pt was treated
with kayaxelate, calcium gluconate, and insulin.  Potassium
dropped to normal range before surgery.

On [**8-6**], intrathoracic tracheoplasty was performed. Mesh was used
to reconstruct the airways.  A R apical [**Doctor Last Name **] drain placed.  The
tracheostomy tube was changed out.  The pt tolerated this
procedure well.  The pt was sent to the SICU to recover.  The
following day, flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration
was performed to remove thick secretions. The bronchoscopy
demonstrated tracheal edema with thick secretions in L lung.
Posteratively, the pt's CK levels rose above 10,000.  The pt was
started on a bicarbonate drip.  The patient developed lower
extremity and scrotal edema following the fluid administrations.
 The patient was treated with lasix, and the edema decreased.
The pt's CK levels were followed throughout his postoperative
course until they fell below 600.

On [**7-21**], the pt underwent a swallow evaluation including a
barium swallow.  The pt passed his evaluation with no signs of
aspiration, leak, or fistula.  The patient's diet was advanced.


On [**8-10**], a bronchoscopy showed an edematous, erythematous
trachea that was patent without necrosis.  Granulation tissue
was visualized.  Following the bronchoscopy, the patient was
transferred to the floor.

On both [**8-10**] and [**8-13**], the pt's hemoglobin dropped to 22.1 and
23.2 respectively, and the pt received blood transfusions.  He
received the blood with no complications.  ID order a CT thorax
on [**8-15**].  On [**8-16**], as the pt was stable, the pt was discharged
home with followup scheduled in 1 week.
