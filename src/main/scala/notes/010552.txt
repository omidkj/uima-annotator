Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with acute on chronic systolic heart failure, persistent
chest pain, presented from OSH to r/o ACS


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent to left anterior
descending artery


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M with CAD, s/p MI '[**84**], s/p LAD and mid-RCA stent
placement in 7/99 with cardiac cath in [**2106-10-12**] which revealed a
right-dominant system, LMCA with no angiographically apparent
disease, LAD with mild luminal irregularities, patent stents and
mid-vessel 50% stenosis, LCx with proximal 50% stenosis, RCA
with 90% ostial in-stent restenosis with moderate luminal
irregularies, s/p successful PTCA and stenting of the ostial
RCA. The cath also revealed normal right-sided filling
pressures, low-normal left-sided filling pressures with a
depressed cardiac index and elevated systemic vascular
resistence. He also has PMH of CHF s/p [**Hospital1 **]-V ICD placed about 9
years ago. He presents to the CCU with acute excerbation of
systolic heart failure, persistent chest pain, and r/o ACS from
OSH.
.
At [**Location (un) 11790**] OSH, patient presented with chest pain and was
treated with morphine and nitro gtt, which reportedly dropped
his SBP to 80s-90s and only converted his chest pain to a [**6-17**]
(previously [**11-17**]) and was r/o'd for MI. He was also treated as
an acute on chronic systolic heart failure exacerbation and
diuresed by IV lasix. At OSH, noted to have U/A with 2+
leukocytes, + nitrites, 80-100 WBC. Today, patient developed
substernal chest pressure, diaphoresis, received nitro and
morphine which dropped his blood pressure, not given aspirin or
heparin.  Was transferred here, had continued chest pain en
route, but resolved upon arrival.  Since arrival here has been
chest pain free.
.
On review of systems, patient has a history of hematuria, he
denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis,pulmonary embolism, bleeding after surgery,cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

EKG ([**9-28**])- Baseline rhythm is probably atrial fibrillation.
There are native, paced and fusion beats seen.

CXR ([**9-28**])- A left subclavian pacemaker is in situ with the tips
projected over the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary
sinus. No evidence of
pulmonary edema. No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia.
Tiny bilateral basal pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is seen.

Cardiac cath ([**9-29**])-
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mildly elevated left sided filling pressure.
3. Successful PCI of the LAD with BMS.

EKG ([**9-29**])- Ventricular paced rhythm and intermittent intrinsic
A-V conduction in the context of background atrial fibrillation

ECHO ([**10-1**])- Severe regional hypokinesis and apical akinesis. An
apical thrombus cannot be excluded, even after the use of
contrast. Calcified aortic stenosis with aortic stenosis - the
gradients are likely low due to
