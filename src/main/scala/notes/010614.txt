Chief Complaint:
weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**3-26**] Redo Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 4 (Left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending, Saphenous vein graft
to Diagonal, Saphenous vein graft to Obtuse marginal, Saphenous
vein graft to posterior descending artery)
[**3-19**] Cardiac Cath

History of Present Illness:
78 year old male with a history of coronary artery bypass
surgery [**39**] years ago, remote myocardial infarction, chronic
Atrial fibrillation, and Diabetes type 2 presented to outside
hospital with fatigue, weakness, cough and subjective fever.
The week prior he was admitted to an outside facility for
weakness which was thought to be secondary to inderal dosing.
The patient saw his outpatient cardiologist following discharge,
asked to wear a holter monitor which showed 3 second pauses.  He
was scheduled to return to Dr.[**Name (NI) 23188**] office this coming
Wednesday.
.
On the day of admission to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital, the
patient's daughter found him lying on the floor, unable to stand
on his own.  He denies any LOC at that time.  His initial vital
signs were T 100.7, HR 102 (irregular) and BP 158/90.  He had a
CXR which showed evidence of a LUL opacity.  He was admitted for
suspected pneumonia.  He initially received levaquin and given
IV fluids.  As the patient became more wheezy on exam, a BNP was
checked found to be 405.  He was then treated with IV lasix X 1
(unclear dose).  He became more dyspneic and hypoxic, then
transferred to the ICU.  He was found to be in a rapid
ventricular rate with A fib, and treated with IV lopressor.  In
the ICU, a TTE showed an EF of 20-25% with severe global
hypokinesis, dilated LA, mild TR, and no other valvular
dysfunction.  CE's were sent and the initial set showed CK 353,
MB 20, Trop I 15.5, then repeat at 2 am CK 395, MB 55, Trop I
9.0, then prior to transfer was CK 1506, MB 299, Trop I 43.3.
He was given high dose aspirin, loaded with 600mg of plavix, and
put on IV heparin for transfer.  He was treated with IV
lopressor for his rapid rate.
.
The patient on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], was asymptomatic.  He was
initially transferred to the cath lab for suspected cardiac
catheterization, but given his elevated INR, the decision was
made to postpone cardiac cath until the AM.

Pertinent Results:
[**3-31**]- INR 1.3

[**3-19**] CARDIAC CATH: 1.  Coronary angiography of this right
dominant system demonstrated severe native three vessel disease.
 The LMCA had no stenosis.  The LAD was heavily calcified and
had serial long stenoses ~85% in the proximal to mid vessel.
The LAD  was a large and patent in its mid to distal pole.  The
LCX was occluded.  The RCA was occluded. 2.  Venous conduit
arteriography showed SVG/RCA and SVG/OM occlusion. 3.
Angiography of the LIMA for upcoming re-do CABG showed a large
non-obstructed vessel. 4.  Resting hemodynamics revealed
elevated right and left ventricular enddiastolic filling
pressures at 14 and 15 mmHg, respectively.  The PCWP was 20
mmHg.  The mean PA pressure was 27 mmHg (phasic 40/16 mmHg). The
cardiac index was depressed at 1.6 L/min/m2.  The mean systolic
arterial pressure was 71 mmHg (phasic 105/51 mmHg).

[**3-20**] Chest CT: 1. Multifocal areas of ground-glass opacities
involving mainly the upper lobes. Differential diagnosis is
broad and includes pneumonia and ARDS, although the distribution
is not typical. Edema is less likely due to lack of other signs.
2. Atherosclerotic changes as described above. 3. Cardiomagaly.
4. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

[**3-20**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA stenosis
<40%.

[**3-26**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: 1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is present in the left
atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is
depressed (<0.2m/s). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. 2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild to
moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with .
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed LVEF= 30 %). 3. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. 4. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 5. There are
three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. 6. The
mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass
study, the patient was receiving vasoactive infusions including
milrinone and norepiepinephrine and is being AV paced. 1. LV
ventricular function and RV function are unchanged. 2. MR is
still moderate 3. Aortic contours appear intact. 4. Other
findings are unchanged

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the history of present illness, Mr. [**Known lastname 7363**] was
transferred from outside hospital to ICU at [**Hospital3 **] for
further cardiac work-up. In addition to being medically managed
for a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, he received
treatment for congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation and
pneumonia. On [**3-19**] he was brought for a cardiac cath which
revealed severe three vessel disease and totally occluded
saphenous vein grafts. Cardiac surgery was consulted for redo
bypass surgery. He underwent further work-up which included
chest CT and carotid U/S prior to surgery. His status slowly
improved while receiving medical management over the next week.
During this time, both his kidney and liver function showed
improvement with continuous lab work. On [**3-26**] he was brought to
the operating room where he underwent a redo coronary artery
bypass graft x 4. Please see operative report for surgical
details. Following surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
His chest tubes and temporary pacing wires were removed per
cardiac surgery protocol. He was started on betablocker,
diuretic, statin and aspirin therapy. He was transferred from
the ICU on POD#2. His post op course was uneventful with the
exception of failing to void. the foley was replaced and he was
