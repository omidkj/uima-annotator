INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: No mass/thrombus in the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D
images. Normal LV wall thickness. Low normal LVEF. No LV
mass/thrombus.

LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal;
basal
anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal
inferoseptal - normal;
mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior
- normal;

septal apex -
normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex -
normal;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

[**Last Name (Prefixes) **]: Normal ascending [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5236**] diameter. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in
the descending thoracic [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5236**].

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **]
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient
was under
general anesthesia throughout the procedure.

Conclusions:
Pre--CPB: No mass/thrombus is seen in the left atrium or left
atrial
appendage. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Overall
left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). No
masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma
in the
descending thoracic [**Name13 (STitle) 5236**]. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. No
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Before going on CPB, patient developed ischemia, most noteably
laterally,
septum and apex. Treated with NTG/NEO + heparin with rapid
resolution.

Post-CPB: Preserved biventricular function. No AI/MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 18350**]t. Other
parameters as pre-CPB.

58 year old man s/p CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:

CLINICAL HISTORY: Post CABG. Postop.

CHEST, PA AND LATERAL, [**2134-4-12**]

FINDINGS: Compared to [**2134-4-10**], left lower lobe linear
atelectasis is nearly resolved. The lungs are hyperinflated
consistent with COPD. There are small bilateral pleural
effusions. No evidence for pneumothorax. Sternotomy wires and
post CABG changes are noted. There is residual gaseous
distention of the splenic flexure.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2134-4-6**] from
[**Hospital1 **] for further management of his coronary artery disease.
His catheterization at [**Hospital1 **] revealed significant Left main
and 3 vessel disease with a preserved LVEF.  Please see
catheterization report for details.  Given the severity of his
disease, the cardiac surgical service was consulted for surgical
revascularization. He was worked-up in the usual preoperative
manner.  On [**2134-4-7**] he successfully underwent CABGx4 (LIMA->LAD,
SVG->Diag2, SVG->OM, SVG->RCA).  Afterward he was transferred to
the Cardiac surgery recovery unit in stable condition and
awakened neurologically intake.   He was weaned from ventilator
support, extubated, and pressors were weaned.  On POD 2 he was
then transferred to the Stepdown unit for further recovery.  His
chest tubes were removed without complication.  He was gently
diuresed to his preoperative weight, beta blockade and aspirin
therapy were resumed, and physical therapy service was consulted
to assist with his postoperative strength and mobility.
Electrolytes were repleted as needed.  On POD 2 his epicardial
pacing wires were removed without complication. he continued to
improve his ability to ambulate including climbing stairs
without respiratory distress or chest pain.  On POD 5 Mr. [**Known lastname **]
had good exercise tolerance, no SOB, or Chest pain.  His blood
pressure was stable.  His sternotomy and leg incision were
clean, dry, and intact without evidence of infection.  He was
discharged home on POD 5 with services in good condition,
cardiac diet, sternal precautions, and instructed to follow up
with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2-1**] weeks/cardiologist in [**3-5**] weeks.  He will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] in four weeks.
