Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure, tracheobronchomalacia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**11-1**] Percutaneous tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy
[**10-31**] Lumbar puncture (opening pressure 26, closing 19)
R PICC
R radial arterial line

History of Present Illness:
58F HD 84/ICU day 14 with infected
VP shunt and increased ICP, multiple superinfections, and
tracheobronchomalacia [**12-18**] multiple intubations, intubated, now
here for treatment of TBM adn respiratory failure.
The patient was admitted to OSH [**2120-10-7**] for MRSA PNA and
meth/vanc sensitive staph aureus meningitis.  The patient was
treated with linezolid x 14 days for both infections.  She then
developed bacteremia and UTI, for which she was treated with
broad-spectrum abx. These were weaned to cefuroxime on [**10-25**]
according to sensitivities for
Klebsiella/Serratia/Citrobacter/Enterobacter.
She was intubated multiple times for respiratory failure, most
recently [**10-18**].  The patient developed stridor during her
hospital
stay, and a CT neck revealed tracheal stenosis not amenable to
tracheostomy. At this point, the patient was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**]
for treatment of TBM.
The patient had her VP shunt removed due to her meningitis and
subsequently developed symptomatic increased ICP (blurry vision,
HA).  Patient underwent weekly LPs to relieve the pressure, alst
performed on [**10-23**].  Neurosurgery and neurology's recs re:
reinsertion of VP shunt were not to replace it until 6-8 weeks
after completion of abx and after she had had 0 WBC in her CSF
cell count x2.  Until now, the WBC has been decreasing and CSF
sterile on cx.
The patient also has diabetes insipidus associated with her
pseudotumor cerebri and meningitis.  She has refused nasal
desmopression but was given prn DDAVP IV, and her sodium levels
have been normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted [**10-28**] as a transfer from UConn with diagnosis of
tracheobronchomalacia. Upon review of CT scan performed at the
refering facility the diagnosis was unclear.  We proceeded to
preform a flexible bronchoscopy through her endotracheal tube
which demonstrated mild to moderate malacia of the trachea, but
not significant such that it would be contributing to her
respiratory failure. Subsequently a flexible bronchoscopy was
performed nasally to evalute the supraglottic anatomy. Again it
was somewhat non-diagnostic. A thoracic surgery consult was
obtained for evaluation of the patient for tracheostomy. The
patient had been weaned on the ventilator down to settings of
PSV/0.4/5/5. She was then taken to the operating room on [**11-1**]
for a rigid bronchoscopy, possible tracheostomy. Evaluation with
the rigid bronchoscope demonstrated a significant stricturing at
the level of the 1st tracheal ring, given this finding we did
not feel as though extubation would be appropriate and we then
proceeded with a percutaneous tracheostomy under direct
bronchoscopic vision. It was felt that tracheamalacia was not
the cause of her respiratory failure, but it was likely
secondary to the stricture. A cuffed, non-fenestrated, Portex
8-0 tracheostomy, with an inner cannula. At that same time a
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was placed.
