Brief Hospital Course:
70yo F with HTN and dyslipidemia who was sent to ED from PCP's
office for hypoxia in the setting of community aquired PNA x 2
weeks, refractory to outpatient azithromycin and was admitted to
the ICU for severe pneumonia and sepsis which were complicated
by multisystem failure including respiratory and renal failure.
.
She Presented to the ICU with a Pneumonia like picture.
Stabalized on 4 L 02, but continued to have tachypnea.  Due to
difficulty maintaining respiratory rate, patient was electively
intubated.  Had imaging consistent with severe right pulmonary
pneumonia as well as progressing rounded left lower lobe
opacities, likely infectious in nature.  CT scan complimented
CXR, but was negative for pulmonary effusions.  Started on broad
antibiotics including vancomycin, zosyn, and levofloxacin.  As
pt had history of traveling to [**State 2690**] within the previous several
weeks multiple tests for fungus, EBV, legionella, AFB,
cryptococcus, sputum, blood, and urine cultures all were
negative.  The patient had a BAL after intubation which was
negative for microorganisms including PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] became
progressivley more hypoxic requriing increased PEEP and FiO2.
ARDSnet protocol was instituted as CXR was concerning for
possible ARDS.  Trathoracic pressure monitoring was performed
via esophageal balloon manometry. Despite these efforts patient
showed no clinical or radiological improvement and continued to
have difficulty on the vent requiring increased FiO2 and PEEP to
maintain her oxygen saturation. She also developed oliguric
renal failure and CVVH was started. She was gradually weaned of
sedation but did not regain consciousness. Throughout her
hospital stay the ICU team worked closely with the patient's
family and HCP who were aware of the worsening prognosis  in the
setting of multi-organ failure and lack of improvement. On
hospital day 20 in accordance with the family's wishes she was
terminally extubated. She expired shortly thereafter with the
family at the bedside.
