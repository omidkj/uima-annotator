Pertinent Results:
Echo [**3-1**]: PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is normal in size. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the right
atrium or right atrial appendage. A left-to-right shunt across
the interatrial septum is seen at rest. A small secundum atrial
septal defect is present. 2. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are
consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. 3.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic function is normal. 4. There are simple atheroma in the
aortic root. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 5. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area
<0.8cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. 6. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. 7. There is no pericardial effusion. POST-CPB: The
Bioprosthetic (#23 Perimount) Aortic Valve is well seated
without any paravalvular leak. No Aortic Regurgitation is seen.
The LV systolic function is well preserved. The RV systolic
function is also well preserved. There is no evidence of aortic
dissection.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit after undergoing work-up as
an outpatient. On [**3-1**] she was brought to the operating room
where she underwent a aortic valve replacement. Please see
operative report. Following surgery she was transferred to the
CSRU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later on op
day she was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and extubated. On post-op day one chest tubes were removed and
diuretics and beta blockers were started. She was gently
diuresed towards her pre-op weight. Later this day she was
transferred to the SDU. On post-op day three her epicardial
pacing wires were removed. Physical therapy worked with patient
during hospital course for strength and mobility. She continued
to improve other the next several days with adjustment in her
medications and appeared ready for discharge home on post-op day
****.
