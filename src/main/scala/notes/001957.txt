History of Present Illness:
51 y/o M transferred from [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 8125**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] with coffee ground emesis.
Recently admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service with an NSTEMI/viral
myo-pericarditis.  At that time cath demonstrated clean
coronaries, but trop reached 3.0, and regional LV systolic
dysfunction.  No echo performed.  Was treated with NSAIDS during
hospital stay.  Since going home has he intermittent chills,
fevers.  Black vomitus since Thursday.  Went to OSH with coffee
ground emesis.  No BRB.  Guaiac positive from below.  No NG
lavage done at OSH.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 99.0 P114 BP105/70 R93-94% 2LNC O2
sat. Hct stable at OSH.  OG tube was flushed and did not clear,
but no BRB - was dark colored.  No further emesis.  CT torso
obtained given recent instrumentation that showed airspace
opacities in right, middle, and upper lobes, c/w aspiration and
pneumonia.  Was given vancomycin in ED, had received levaquin at
OSH.  GI consult felt this was likely not variceal bleed and
said would see first thing in AM.  PPI gtt continued, and
octreotide d/c'd.

At time of transfer, HR 105, 124/69, RR16, 93%2-3L NC, patient
with 4 large guage peripheral IV's.

[**3-16**] Echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%). There
is no ventricular septal defect. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic
velocity is likely related to high cardiac output. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

[**3-16**] CT Torso:
1. Inflammatory change of the right colon and mesenteric/portal
venous gas is highly concerning for ischemia.
2. Extensive right diffuse airspace opacification in a pattern
that suggests aspiration or bronchopneumonia.

[**3-16**] Upper GI Endoscopy:
Findings: Esophagus: Excavated Lesions [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear was
seen in the gastroesophageal junction.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Erythema, congestion and friability of the
mucosa with contact bleeding were noted in the antrum. These
findings are compatible with gastritis.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
Impression: Erythema, congestion and friability in the antrum
compatible with gastritis. [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
Recommendations: No active bleeding seen, no varices. Continue
PPI twice daily. Continue to monitor Hct and transfuse to
Hct>26.

CTA abdomen/pelvis ([**3-17**]): The lung bases demonstrate scattered
patchy opacities which are more prominent on the right and may
represent small foci of pneumonia. There are small bilateral
effusions, right greater than left. Heart size is normal. There
is no pericardial effusion. The liver, spleen, adrenals,
pancreas and intra-abdominal loops of small bowel are
unremarkable. Post-cholecystectomy changes are stable. The
imaged venous and arterial vessels are patent. Wall thickening
and stranding along the hepatic flexure to the mid ascending
colon is slightly less conspicuous since [**2193-3-16**]. There are no
definite areas of pneumatosis, with air in the non dependant
portions of the cecum (3a:91-116) likely representing air. The
kidneys enhance and secrete contrast symmetrically. The imaged
small bowel is unremarkable. CT PELVIS: The rectum, prostate and
sigmoid are unremarkable. The bladder demonstrates a Foley
catheter and a small amount of air. Bone windows demonstrate no
evidence of lesions that is suspicious for metastatic or
infectious focus, with multilevel degenerative changes in the
thoracolumbar spine which are similar to [**2193-3-16**]. A linear
lucency along the superior right acetabulum (3B:372) likely
represents nondisplaced fracture.

IMPRESSION:
1. There is no evidence of ischemia with resolution of portal
venous and
mesenteric air since yesterday. Colitis involving the hepatic
flexure to the mid ascending colon is less prominent since
yesterday.
2. Likely Nondisplaced right acetabulum rim fracture.

CXR ([**3-19**]): Bilateral airspace with greater involvement on the
right is
slightly improved. There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
Heart size
and mediastinal contours are unchanged. Old rib fracture noted
on the right. IMPRESSION: Improving aspiration pneumonitis or
pneumonia.

Microbiology:
urine cx ([**3-16**]) negative
blood cx ([**3-16**]) no growth to date
MRSA screen ([**3-16**]) negative
Influenza a/b antigen negative ([**3-16**])
C diff toxin negative ([**3-18**])

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 51 y/o M w/ hep C who presented with UGIB after 3d of
high dose ibuprofen for new dx of myopericarditis manifested by
coffee ground emesis and aspiration pneumonia.

# GI Bleed: Evidence of gastritis and [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear on
endoscopy with hematocrits stable after 2 U prbcs given in the
ICU. He also had a new finding of colitis on colonoscopy but
this was not likely source for bleed. He has tolerated PO BID
PPI and should continue this until follow up with his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
should avoid NSAIDs.
- PPI [**Hospital1 **]
- Monitor Hct daily

# Aspiration pneumonia: The patient presented after vomiting
with fever, elevated WBC count, and CXR/CT findings of
infiltrate, making pneumonia likely [**2-25**] to aspiration of gastric
contents. He was negative for influenza on admission. His
infiltrate persisted over days. He will finish a 14-day course
of levofloxacin/flagyl (for both pneumonia and colitis) on
[**2193-3-31**]. Sputum culture was contaminated but did not show MRSA so
vancomycin discontinued on transfer to medical floor.
Supplemental oxygen was used as necessary to maintain oxygen
saturation > 92%.

# Tachycardia: Tachycardia on admission resolved with volume
repletion, likely resultant from bleeding. He denied recent
alcohol use on admission. He does take benzodiazepines as an
outpatient so this was continued. Tamponade was considered but
echocardiogram showed a tri
