Chief Complaint:
chest pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2173-8-30**] - CABG x 3(LIMA->LAD, SVG->OM, RCA)


History of Present Illness:
72yoM with h/o CAD s/p recent stenting x 2 to LAD ([**2173-8-11**]), and
recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] (discharged [**2173-8-25**]) for intermittent
chest/abdominal pain anorexia and fatigue, at which time he
ruled out for MI (please refer to discharge summary for details
of this admission). Hospital course was complicated by ARF
(likely due to dehydration and medications), guaiac positive
stool with hct drop (?gastritis - LFTs nl, abd u/s nl, endoscopy
planned as outpatient). His antihypertensive regimen was
optimized and he was switched to EC aspirin to prevent
medication-related gastritis prior to discharge.

A few hours after returning home, he ate some frozen pizza, then
began to feel diaphoretic. Soon after that he began to have
severe [**9-20**] chest pressure radiating to his jaw and the back of
his neck. This was similar to anginal pain that he has had
before, and if anything it was even more severe than the pain he
had prior to his recent stents. He then presented the following
day to an OSH with CP and SOB. He was found to be in rapid afib
with rate in 140s. He was started on cardizem drip and given
metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **], heparin drip, aspirin, and plavix. He also
received IV nitroglycerin for CP. He was not completely CP free
until aruond 11pm when he had been on nitro gtt for some time.
Troponin was 4.9 at the OSH. According to the discharge summary,
the patient was in SR at the time of transfer. He was also
started on levoquin for a UTI.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2173-8-26**] for further
management of his chest pain and rapid atrial fibrillation.
Diltiazem and beta blockade was used with good rate control.
Heparin was started for anticoagulation in addition to his
current plavix and aspirin use. Given his known severe coronary
artery disease, the cardiac surgical service was consulted for
surgical revascularization. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was worked-up in the
usual preoperative manner. Levofloxacin was started for a
urinary tract infection. Given his history of guaiac positive
stool and anemia, his hematocrit was watched closely and
remained stable. Although he had known, asymptomatic carotid
artery stenosis, it was decided to delay intervention until
after his surgical revascularization. On [**2173-8-30**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting to three vessels. Postoperatively he was taken
to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. On
postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact
and was extubated. Beta blockade, aspirin and plavix were
resumed. He converted back into atrial fibrillation which was
rate controlled with beta blockade and the addition of
amiodarone. He was pancultured for leukocytosis which was
negative. The renal service was consulted for an elevated
creatinine. Urinary eosinophils were negative and a renal
ultrasound showed an atrophic left kidney. It was presumed that
he had acute tubular necrosis from bypass and that his
creatinine would likely recover. Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transfused for
postoperative anemia. As he remained in atrial fibrillation,
coumadin was started for anticoagulation. His pacing wires and
chest tubes were removed when protocol was met. His renal
function slowly improved. A right upper quadrant ultrasound was
performed for elevated liver enzymes and nausea which was
negative. On postoperative day five, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred
to the cardiac surgical step down unit for further recovery. He
continued to be gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight.
The physical therapy service worked with him daily to help with
his postoperative strength and mobility. Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to
make steady progress and was discharged home on postoperative
day eight. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist
and his primary care physician as an outpatient.
