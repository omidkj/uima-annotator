Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Heparin Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6378**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath and tachycardia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
IVC filter placed at [**Hospital1 18**] by vascular surgery [**12-5**] by
intravenous jugular catheter.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 10321**] is a 50 year old male with grade 1 pilocytic
astrocytoma s/p recent suboccipital carniotomy brought to [**Hospital1 18**]
from [**Hospital3 **] center due to tachycardia and dyspnea noted
by rehab radiology faculty. His post-cramotomy ([**11-18**]) course
was complicated by repeat craniotomy ([**11-24**]) for re-bleeding and
residual mass as well as by RLL pneumonia (completed 7 day
course on Levofloxacin). He was discharged to rehab on dilantin
ppx and DVT prophylaxis (heparin 5000 U SC TID, originally
written on [**11-18**] on initial admit). Following d/c from [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**11-30**] and prior to this admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 10321**] reports minimal
ambulation and activity (without HA, nausea, vomiting, or
palpitations) with severe R calf pain and dyspnea while getting
physical therapy at rehab that morning. At that time he was
noted to have LE swelling, tachycardia, and dyspnea. Bilateral
DVT's were discovered on ultrasound ([**12-5**]) and Mr. [**Known lastname 10321**] was
transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

In the ED, vitals were T 97.8 HR 119 BP 129/97 RR 24 SaO2 98%RA.
Chest CT confirmed massive bilateral PEs. He was evaluated by
his neurosurgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who recommended starting heparin
at 1000 units/hour without bolus and repeating a head CT once
the patient was therapeutic (PTT 50-70). He also advised
avoiding TPA. Vascular was also consulted in case of emergent
embolectomy. He was transfered to the MICU. ECHO at that time
showed RV free wall hypokinesis and abnormal septal motion with
a dilated RV. He remained on [**3-13**] L nc with oxygen sats > 95%. He
had an IVC filter placed by the vascular team through a right IJ
approach. Head CT (once PTT > 50) showed no acute bleeding.

On admission to the ED, his wife noted that his right facial
droop and dyarthria have been improving. He has also recently
had a corneal abrasion [**3-12**] being unable to close his right eye.


On admission to the [**Hospital **] medical service his vitals were T
97.7 HR 105, BP 124/82 R 24 SaO2 97%RA. Physical exam was
notable for reduced lung sounds at the bases bilaterally (L>R)
with inspiratory wheezes and mild crackles appreciated at the
mid right throax and lower left lung base respectively.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2118-12-5**]
CTA CHEST: There is massive bilateral pulmonary embolism with
thrombus
filling the left pulmonary artery extending into all lobar
branches and their respective segmental and subsegmental
branches. There is oligemia of the left lung though there is no
evidence of infarct. On the right, there is a saddle embolus at
the bifurfaction of the right pulmonary artery with clot
involving the lobar and segmental branches and several
subsegmental branches in the right lower lobe. There is evidence
of right heart strain with slight flattening of the
interventricular septum. The aorta and remainder of great
vessels are unremarkable. There is no pleural or pericardial
effusion. There is bilateral minimal dependent atelectasis. No
pneumorthorax. Limited views of the upper abdomen reveal no
abnormality.
IMPRESSION:
Massive bilateral pulmonary embolism. The findings of this study
were
communicated with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and and placed on the ED dashboard
at the time of initial review.
.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2118-12-6**]
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50-55%). Left ventricular dysnchrony is present. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2118-12-5**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Postoperative changes in the cerebellum with possible
residual
tumor in the surgical bed. Recommend correlation with MRI.
2. Hypodensity in the right frontal lobe related to prior
ventriculostomy
catheter.
3. No evidence for active hemorrhage. No other acute
intracranial pathology
.
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2118-12-6**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Postoperative change in the cerebellum with likely resolving
hematoma in the surgical bed. Continued attention is recommended
on followup imaging to exclude residual tumor.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWALLOW Study Date of [**2118-12-9**]
IMPRESSION:
