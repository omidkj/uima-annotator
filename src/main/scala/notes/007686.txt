[**2160-2-15**] Chest X-ray (prelim): multifocal pneumonia
.
[**2160-2-19**] Transthoracic Echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests
an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2157-8-24**],
evidence of Grade II diastolic dysfunction is now present.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 year old woman that has a history significant for CAD,
diabetes, hypertension, diastolic heart failure, and s/p stroke
admitted with dyspnea and multifocal PNA initially admitted to
the medical floor, then transferred to the MICU for respiratory
distress, then transferred back to the floor < 24 hours later.
.
In the MICU, the patient was treated with Levofloxacin 750mg PO
q48 hours for community-acquired pneumonia.  She was given Lasix
20mg IV for possible pulmonary edema due to heart failure.  She
improved and was transferred to the floor the following day.
.
Once on the medical floor, she continued to improve with IV
Lasix which she received 40mg IV BID X 2 days, ipratropium and
albuterol nebs, and Levofloxacin which she completed during her
admission.  Her legionella and viral nasal swabs were negative.
Blood cultures are no growth to date and sputum cultures were
contaminated.
.
For her coronary artery disease, she was continued on aspirin
and plavix.  Her BNP was elevated on admission and she likely
has some component of congestive heart failure.  She was
diuresed and improved.  Her wheezing may have been a cardiac
wheeze.  She had an echo on [**2160-2-19**] which showed grade II
diastolic failure.  She was continued on her home blood pressure
medications with the exception of Losartan which was initially
held due to elevated creatinine of 2.0 (baseline 1.4-1.7).  Her
creatinine improved to 1.7 on discharge and she was restarted on
her Losartan.  She will follow-up with her PCP regarding testing
her kidney function again.
.
She was also anemic while admitted with a hematocrit of 25-29.
She had no clear source of bleeding.  Iron studies revealed iron
deficiency and she was started on iron 325mg PO qday.  B12 and
folate were checked and were normal.  She did not require any
blood transfusions and prior colonoscopy this year was normal.
She will follow-up with her PCP regarding her anemia.  Her
chronic kidney disease is likely contributing.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was hyponatremic on admission with a sodium of 129.
This improved to 137 and on discharge was 133.  She likely had
an SIADH-related hyponatremia due to her pneumonia.  TSH and
cortisol were checked and were normal.
.
Her diabetes was controlled on home doses of Lantus and Humalog
sliding scale.  She was slightly hyperglycemic with blood sugars
in the 200s.  Her oral hyperglycemic [**Doctor Last Name 360**] was held while
inpatient and resumed upon discharge.  Her insulin sliding scale
was increased.  She should follow-up with her PCP regarding
further glucose control.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was put on SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis.  She was
discharged with an appoin
