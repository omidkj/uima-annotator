History of Present Illness:
[**Known lastname **] [**Known firstname 6339**] is a 79-year-old gentleman with MMP including
critical aortic stenosis s/p valvuloplasty, IDDM, paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation, h/o MRSA pna, h/o c.diff, who is s/p trach
and peg after MVC ~19 weeks ago who presented to the Emergency
Department from [**Hospital3 7**] with bleeding around trach and
hypotension. Per ED notes, on day prior to admission patient had
significant bleeding from tracheostomy site and increasing
hematuria -> INR was 4.7 at that time. He was given vit K and
INR improved to 1.7 the following day. On evening of admission,
patient dropped blood pressure to systolic of 70s, which
responded to IV fluid and FFP. He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for management.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were T 101.6 rectal, HR 75, BP 132/77
at triage (later dropped to systolics in 80s). He was started on
neosynephrine and received 1L IVFs. Stool was guiaic positive,
no melena. He received Vancomycin/Cipro/Flagyl. He was admitted
to the ICU for further management.
.
Of note, patient recently in MICU from [**Date range (1) 74060**] for altered
mental status, which improved during ICU stay with supportive
care. EEG consistent with encephalopathy. Patient had 1 blood
culture with coagulase negative staph, presumed contaminant. No
other sources of infection were identified.

   CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN ASSAY (Final [**2129-7-1**]):
      FECES NEGATIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.

.

ECHO:
[**2129-6-27**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular  hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function  (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
moderate aortic  valve stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The  mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is  seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity sizes and
regional/global biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral
regurgitation.

RUE ultrasound [**2129-6-27**]:
FINDINGS: Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right jugular,
subclavian, axillary, and brachial veins were performed. There
is normal compressibility, flow, and augmentation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in the right upper extremity.
.
CXR: [**6-29**]: REASON FOR EXAM: Diminished LS at bases bilaterally.
AP bedside suboptimal due to body habitus and low lung volumes.
Cardiovascular status is difficult to evaluate. There is
equivocal vascular congestion that is unchanged from prior study
performed 2 days earlier ([**2129-6-27**]). Equivocal improved
aeration in the left lower lobe. There is probable small left
pleural effusion. Cardiac silhouette is obscured by the pleuro-
parenchimal abnormality. Tracheostomy tube is seen in adequate
position.

IMPRESSION: Equivocal increased aeration of the left lower lobe
.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P 79-year-old gentleman residing at [**Hospital **] rehab s/p MVC in
[**Month (only) 958**] with prolonged hospital stay s/p trach/vent, IDDM,
critical AS s/p valvuloplasty, admitted to MICU for hypotension

.
# HYPOTENSION: Patient was admitted with hypotension that was
initially thought due to infection.  For this he was started on
broad spectrum antibiotics that were weaned to have narrower
spectrum given that the sputum cultures showed pansensitive
pseudomonas.  The patient should continue a course of
ciprofloxacin for 3 more days (total of 8)
- ECHO during this admission showed normal ejection fraction and
persistent aortic stenosis.

# FEVER: thought to be secondary to his pneumonia, improved
rapidly.  Blood cultures negative.
.
# Respiratory failure: Thought due to both pneumonia as well as
possible critical care myopathy causing poor function. However,
the patient had a NIF -17, c/w myopathic process. Additionally
the patient was transitioned from pressure support to assist
control intermittently depending on his minute ventilation and
work of breathing.  He was stable on pressure support for approx
24 hours prior to discharge.  Also had pleural effusions on
chest x-ray that are likely due to fluid overload that should
improve with improving diuresis.
To improve oxygenation, we recommend continuing lasix for goal
500 to 1000cc neg/24hrs x3 days, ie lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **] with close
monitoring of creatinine and electrolytes.
.
# Aortic stenosis: s/p valvuloplasty with initial valve area of
0.76 and now 1-1.2.  Thought by cardiology to need diuresis and
was started.  Initially he was given lasix with good effect that
should be continued until the patient is euvolemic.
.
# ANEMIA:
- Patient with known Fe-deficiency anemia from last admission.
Was continued on supplements and had serial hcts drawn.
Initially patient had a decrease in hct, but was stable after 1
U PRBCs.
.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION : Rate controlled on beta-blocker as
outpatient, with good rate control without betablocker.  Will
restart coumadin today.
.
# CAD
- Stable
- Continue ASA, sho
