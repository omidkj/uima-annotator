LIVER ULTRASOUND
IMPRESSION:
1. Unremarkable liver.
2. No ascites.
3. No hydronephrosis. Caliceal diverticulum with crystals in
lower pole of left kidney

([**2124-7-19**]) CT Trachea
IMPRESSION:
1. Marked tracheobronchomalacia, demonstrated by near collapse
of the central airways on expiration.
2. Moderate subglottic tracheal stenosis; irregularity of the
wall suggests prior therapy by dilatation.
3. Persistent near-collapse of the right middle and lower lobes.
4. Similar focal skeletal deformity centered at T7, unchanged
over one month. However, earlier studies are not available to
confirm stability. Correlation with prior imaging if available,
any clinical factors suggesting recent or prior infection, and
consideration of MR are suggested to evaluate further. Discussed
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 111595**] on [**2124-7-21**].


Brief Hospital Course:
Upon admission, the patient was on a prednisone taper for COPD
flare and finishing his course of antibiotics for bilateral
lower extremity cellulitis (the reason why he had been admitted
a few days prior)
During this admission, we addressed the following issues:
.
1) Hypoxic respiratory failure--from mucus plug/pneumonia. The
patient was intubated in the MICU. Suctioning and bronchoscopy
were successfull removing large mucus plug. Pneumonia was
treated with cefepime and vancomycin. He was initially on
solumedrol 125 TID. He was extubated on day  and transferred to
the floor for continuous management of his COPD flare and
secretions. On the floor, he transitioned quickly from face mask
to nasal cannula 4 Liters. Initially on solumedrol 80 TID, then
by day 2 started on prednisone taper.

MICU Course: Breathing difficulty continued however and
bronchoscopy was performed, and a severe stenosis secondary to
fibrous tissue was found. Patient was again transfered to MICU
for airway monitoring. Patient continued to have increased work
of breathing and required ET intubation. Interventional
Pulmonary was able to re-perform tracheotomy and secure the
airway using a T-piece device. Patient had an uneventful and
rapid recovery and was only requiring supplemental O2 by time of
discharge.
.

2) Hypercarbia, at one point the pt had Co2>100, which is very
above his baseline of 60-70. This was accompanied by marked
alkalosis >60. Both parameters improved steadily. Initially
lasix was decreased to once a day, later discontinued altogether
without worsening of the patient's volume status and marked
improvement in his alkalosis.
.
After above procedure, hypercarbia improved and blood gases
returned to baseline of pCO2 near 70.
.
3) COPD. Exacerbation was managed with steroids, albuterol and
atrovent nebulizers, as well as saline nebs.
.
After airway procedure, predinsone taper was begun and patient
continued to improve.
.
6) DM : Due to steroid induced hyperglycemia, the patient was
kept on a humalog sliding scale thorughout admission, including
MICU course.
.
7) Smoking, on going: received smoking cessation counseling,
kept on nicotine patch
