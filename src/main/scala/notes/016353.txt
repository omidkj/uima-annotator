Brief Hospital Course:
1. DYSPNEA/PULMONARY EMBOLI: The patient had a CTA that showed
significant large PE in distal right and left pulmonary
arteries. Evista was discontinued due to increased risk of VTE
on this medication.  Heparin gtt was started with goal PTT of
60-80.  Her supplemental oxygen requirements decreased with
continued anticoagulation.  She was transitioned from heparin to
lovenox sc and started on coumadin with goal INR [**3-16**].  She was
maintained on lovenox for 48 hours after becoming therapeutic on
coumadin.  She was supratheraputic after several doses of 5 mg
of coumadin, so it was decreased to 3mg, then 2 mg for
discharge.  [**Hospital 197**] clinic at [**Hospital1 112**] was arranged through her
primary physician and [**Name Initial (PRE) **] discussed her dosing regimen in the
hospital with the coumadin clinic nurse practitioner over the
phone prior to discharge.  She was scheduled to follow up with
them Thurs [**2148-12-26**].  She was on room air on discharge, and
given a prescription for graduated compression stocking to
reduce the risk of post phlebitic syndrome (although no DVTs in
her lower ext were documented).

2. HTN--The patient's anti-hypertensives were initially held in
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and restarted upon arrival to the floor with adequate
control of her BP.  There were no episodes of hypotension during
this admission.

3. ARF: This was initially felt to be due to a pre-renal state
from dehydration and decreased forward flow secondary to the PE.
 Her creatinine improved with hydration.

4.  Hyperglycemia:  patient was found to have mildly elevated BG
on her daily lab panel, which will be deferred to her outpatient
management.  Although she was discharged on a short course of
prednisone for her gout flare, her glucose did not show
worsening during her time taking the steroid in house.

5.  gout -- two days prior to discharge, she had acute onset of
podagra, right 1st MCP erythema, warmth and tenderness.  Given
her current anticoagulation, prednisone burst was used to treat,
and she showed significant response prior to discharge.
