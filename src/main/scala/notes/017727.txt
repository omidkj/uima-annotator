Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Tetanus

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2178-11-20**] Aortic Valve Replacement(21mm St. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9041**] Porcine)
and Mitral Valve Replacement(25mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic Porcine).


History of Present Illness:
This is an 84 year old female with known rheumatic heart
disease. In [**2178-10-8**], she presented with hemoptysis. Chest
CT scan at that time was notable for bilateral dense
cosolidations consistent with pulmonary hemorrhage. Infectious
etiology was ruled out and Methotrexate was discontinued. Serial
echocardiograms have shown progression of aortic and mitral
valve disease with severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Further cardiac evaluation included cardiac
catheterization which showed normal coronary arteries. Given new
onset hemoptysis and progression of her valvular heart disease,
she was deemed suitable for cardiac surgical intervention.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate ptx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
84 year old woman with s/p avr
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate ptx
HISTORY: Status post AVR, to evaluate for pneumothorax.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-23**], the patient has
taken a somewhat better inspiration. No definite apical
pneumothorax is appreciated on this examination. No change in
the appearance of the cardiomediastinal contours. Atelectasis,
or even pneumonia persists.

Findings
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Moderate symmetric LVH. Normal regional
LV systolic function. Mildly depressed LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter. Normal
descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Severe AS (AoVA <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-9**]+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Characteristic rheumatic deformity of the mitral
valve leaflets with fused commissures and tethering of leaflet
motion. Moderate mitral annular calcification. Moderate
thickening of mitral valve chordae. Moderate valvular MS (MVA
1.0-1.5cm2) Moderate to severe (3+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
Prebypass

1.No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.

2.There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %).

3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

4.There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.

5.The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is severe aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2). Mild to
moderate ([**12-9**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

6.The mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity.
There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae. There
is moderate valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2). Moderate
to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

7.The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.

Post Bypass

1. Patient is being AV paced and receiving an infusion of
epinephrine and phenylephrine.

2. Left ventricular systolic function is much improved. EF 55%

3. Bioprosthetic valve seen in the mitral position. Leaflets
move well and the valve appears well seated. Trivial mitral
regurgitation. Mean gradient across the mitral valve is 4 mm Hg.


4. Bioprosthetic valve seen in the aortic position. The leaflets
move well and the valve appears well seated. No aortic
regurgitation present. Mean gradient across the aortic valve is
18 mm Hg.

5. About 20 minutes post CPB an echo dense material (about 5mm
in size) seen free floating in the left atrium. Surgeon made
aware. Did not want to go on bypass to look for it. Seemed to
subsequently disappear.

6. Aorta intact post decannulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent aortic and mitral valve
replacements by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. For surgical details, please see
seperate dictated operative note. Following the operation, she
was brought to the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24
hours, she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
incident. Routine chest x-ray was notable for a small apical
