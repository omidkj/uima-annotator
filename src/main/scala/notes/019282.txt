Admission Date:  [**2165-3-31**]       Discharge Date:  [**2165-4-25**]


Service:  TRAUMA

DIAGNOSIS:  Patient status post fall with a left subdural
hematoma

BRIEF HISTORY:  The patient is a 79-year-old male with a past
medical history of cerebrovascular accident who was on
Coumadin who fell one day prior to arrival to the hospital
and was seen in [**Hospital6 33**] initially with
complaints of right rib pain and a scalp hematoma.  At the
outside hospital, his chest x-ray revealed atelectasis of the
right lower lobe and a CT scan of his head revealed a left
side subdural hematoma.  The patient was started on Dilantin,
was transfused with fresh frozen plasma for an INR of 4.3.
Please note that the patient was on Coumadin when he fell.
He had a CT scan of his chest which showed a small
hemopneumothorax on the right side.  The patient was
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital6 2018**].  On further history from the son, the patient tripped
over a doorway threshold in the basement and had an
unwitnessed fall with no acute changes in cognition or
behavior.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension
2.  Hypercholesterolemia
3.  Dementia
4.  Status post cerebrovascular accident in [**2161**] with
residual expressive aphasia

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Coumadin
2.  Atenolol
3.  Zocor
4.  Prinivil
5.  Oxazepam

ALLERGIES:  None

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Remote sinus surgery

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with wife and two sons,
does not drink alcohol and he is a retired maintenance
worker.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  On admission to the trauma service, he was
afebrile.  His vital signs were stable.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  His pupils were equal and
reactive.  His GCS was 15.  He was awake and alert x2.
NECK:  Nontender with no stepoff.
CHEST:  Lungs were clear.
HEART:  Regular.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.
PELVIS:  Stable.
RECTAL:  Guaiac negative.
BACK:  Nontender with no step-off or deformities.
EXTREMITIES:  He had palpable DP and PT pulses bilaterally.

LABS AND IMAGING:  His white count was 9.  Hematocrit was 30.
Platelets were 119.  His electrocardiogram was normal sinus
rhythm.  His chest x-ray revealed a hemopneumothorax on the
right side.  Head CT significant for 9 mm left subdural
hematoma with no shift.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Trauma
Surgery Intensive Care Unit.  His INR was corrected.  He had
a chest tube placed on the right side, received Dilantin and
had neurologic checks.  The patient had full strength in
bilateral upper and lower extremities.  The patient had a
prolonged Intensive Care Unit course which was complicated by
flash pulmonary edema, as well as a non Q-wave myocardial
infarction.  His further work up included an echocardiogram
which revealed an ejection fraction of 25%.  The patient also
required intubation for this episode of pulmonary edema.
Once his sedation was weaned, he had minimal movement of his
right upper and lower extremity.  Neurosurgery service
recommended obtaining an MRI to rule out an infarct, as well
as an MRI of C-spine to clear for ligamentous injury.  His
MRI revealed no change in the size of the subdural hematoma,
but he did have a left sided caudate infarct.  The patient
was slowly weaned from ventilatory support and tube feeds
were started.  A repeat head CT showed no progression in size
of the subdural hematoma.  His C-spine was cleared.  His
chest tube was removed.  His neurologic status slowly
improved.  He was awake and attentive and was following
commands and had purposeful movements of his left upper and
lower extremities, but he would only withdraw his right upper
and lower extremity to painful stimuli.

From the cardiac standpoint, after his non Q-wave myocardial
infarction, he was started on Lopressor and amlodipine as
well as Prinivil.  After meeting with the family, it was
agreed that the patient would benefit from tracheostomy as
well as percutaneous gastrostomy.  He subsequently had an
increased production of sputum and sputum cultures were
positive for Citrobacter for which he was started on
levofloxacin.  He had a percutaneous tracheostomy and
gastrostomy placed on [**3-10**].  A rehabilitation screen
was then initiated.  Subsequently, his course was complicated
by further fever spikes and he once again grew out
Citrobacter from his sputum and his antibiotics were tailored
and he was started on ceftazidime, responded to that well
with no subsequent fever spikes and he will receive a 10 day
course of ceftazidime.  He was hemodynamically stable and his
Lopressor dose was adjusted in order to control his
tachycardia.  Vancomycin was added for gram positive cocci in
his sputum which he cleared on subsequent sputum samples.  He
tolerated full strength tube feeds via his percutaneous
gastrostomy tubes and supportive management was continued
with a slow wean from the ventilator.  He tolerated short
trach mask trial.  Cardiology service was following the
patient and recommended the use of beta blockers to control
his heart rate, as well as ACE inhibitors for afterload
reduction.  Because of the patient's persistent tachycardia,
which could not be explained, a CT angio was obtained to rule
out pulmonary embolism which was negative.  Rehabilitation
and physical therapy service has been working with the
patient throughout his hospital course.  On [**2165-4-25**], the
patient was accepted by rehabilitation where he will be
transferred to in stable condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Left subdural hemorrhage after a fall,
on Coumadin, as well as a cerebrovascular accident with right
