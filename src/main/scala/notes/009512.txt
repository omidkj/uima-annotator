Intubation.

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old woman with a history of DM2, diastolic

mother. She found her on the toilet, slumped to the left. EMS
was called immendiately. There was no antecedent report of
trauma.

On arrival to the ED, she was afebrile but hypertensive to
197/79. Head CT showed a large intraventricular hemorrhage,
originating from the right thalamus and she received labetalol
gtt and was intubated for airway protection, after also
receiving propofol gtt and dilantin 1g IV. She was admitted to
the NeuroICU.

CT head on admission:
There is a 2.8 x 1.5 cm area of intraparenchymal hemorrhage in
the region of the posterior limb of the right internal capsule
and right thalamus, with extension into the lateral, third, and
fourth ventricles. Given the location of intraparenchymal
hemorrhage, this is of likely hypertensive etiology.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was intubated for airway protection in the ED and
admitted to the NeuroICU. She was evaluated by neurosurgery, who
deemed her not to be a good surgical candidate and the family
declined an EVD after extensive discussion. She was found to
have a UTI and was treated with ciprofloxacin, with subsequent
improvement, but she intermittently spiked fevers and was found
to have MRSA in her sputum and was thus placed on vancomycin.
Neurologically, she remained arousable by voice, opening her
eyes and following commands on her left side; she was able to
lift the left arm and move both legs. There was no response on
her right arm to noxious stimuli. CT showed an intracerebral
hemorrhage, starting just above the right thalamus and extending
into both lateral ventricles, the third ventricle, and the
fourth, spreading down the cerebral aqueduct, with some blood
exiting the foramina of Magendie and Luschka to add a small
subarachnoid component.

The patient's daughter and son serve as the health care proxys.
Discussions regarding trach/PEG and nursing home lead to the
conclusion that the family did not want to pursue either of
those options, since they were deemed inconsistent with the
patient's wishes. She was extubated and made CMO. She passed
away at 0318 on [**2143-12-3**]. Post-mortem examination was declined
by family.
