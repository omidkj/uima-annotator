Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, respiratory distress, MICU call-out

Coronary Catheterization
Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
21 year old woman with a history of ESRD on HD, SLE, lupus
nephritis, BOOP, h/o pericarditis, was admitted for SOB,
respiratory distress-using accessory muscles to breath. Also
found to have HTN urgency BP 183/139. She was recently admitted
on [**11-2**] with similar complaints of increasing DOE and SOB.
She received HD w/removal of 4L on prior admission w/improvement
in her symptoms. Her HTN was also managed w/HD and increasing
her BB to Toprol XL 200mg daily, increasing her Lisinopril to
40mg daily, and was due to have HD on Saturday following d/c
home. She did receive HD on saturday, however only 1kg removed
when 3kg are usually removed. She also admits to eating very
salty foods over the weekend. She presented to ED w/ increasing
SOB.
.
ED course: Initial VS T97.8 P103 BP183/139 R50 90% on RA, 100%
w/NRB and nebs. CXR was consistent with fluid overload. She was
started on BiPAP 12/8 and a nitro gtt. EKG was unchanged. Renal
service aware.
.
MICU course: Pt was stabilized in the ED initially with
BiPap->NC->RA after HD session this AM. She remained
hypertensive, though it has improved to 150s/100s. Once her
vital signs were stable, she was called out to the floor.
.
Currently, pt is without complaints. No chest pain/dyspnea. No
palpitations. She notes that she has had progressively worse
DOE, PND and orthopnea to the point where she sleeps upright
most of the time.

[**11-9**]: Portable CXR: IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with severe
congestive heart failure. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
Follow up radiographs after treatment to ensure no underlying
infection are recommended.
.
[**11-10**]: CT chest w/o contrast: IMPRESSION:

1. Limited study for the assessment of pulmonary vasculature.

2. Very faint patchy ground-glass opacity in bilateral lungs,
which can represent minimal residual disease from the previously
noted airspace consolidations. However, no new interstitial
changes or consolidation.

3. Persistent lymphadenopathy in the right paratracheal, left
axilla, with small pericardial effusion.
.
[**11-12**]: Cardiac cath- FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No angiographically apparent coronary artery disease.
2. Normal left and right sided filling pressures. Normal
pulmonary
arterial and systemic arterial pressures. No evidence of
constritive or
restrictive phsiology. Low normal cardiac index.
3. Successful endomyocardial biopsy.
.
[**11-13**]: Echo INTERPRETATION:
Conclusions:
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is moderate global left
ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed. Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a very small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-11-13**],
the pericardial effusion is now slightly smaller. Left
ventricular systolic function appears similar to slightly
improved.
.
Cardiac MR: Impression:
1. Mild symmetric LV hypertrophy with severely increased LV
mass.
2. Mildly dilated left ventricular cavity size with moderate
global hypokinesis. The LVEF was moderately depressed at 39%. No
MR evidence of myocardial scarring.
3. Normal right ventricular cavity size and function. The RVEF
was mildly depressed at 46%.
4. The indexed diameters of the ascending and descending
thoracic aorta were normal. The main pulmonary artery diameter
index was mildly increased.
5. Normal coronary artery origins with no evidence of anomalous
coronary arteries, and normal signal characteristics of all
visualized vessel segments.
6. Small circumferential pericardial effusion. No evidence of
pericardial constriction found.



Brief Hospital Course:
21 yo F w/ESRD on HD, SLE, lupus nephritis, BOOP, h/o
pericarditis, p/w SOB/respiratory distress in setting of dietary
indiscretion and insufficient fluid removal at HD. Hospital
course by problem below:
.
?Vasculitis- h/o weakly positive ANCA, +[**Doctor First Name **], +anti-Ro, renal
disease, pericardial disease and heart failure of unknown
etiology point to possible rheumatologic etiology to tie things
together. rheum consulted, recommended consulting cards to eval
vessels with cath- L and R cath prelim read with no
abnormalities. Will need to f/u endomyocardial biopsies.
Considered possible FNA/biopsy of lingular granuloma for
pathology- discussed with radiology resident, location not ideal
for CT-guided biopsy; potentially okay for VATS- deferring for
now as pt stable. Formal audiology testing to r/o involvement of
Wegener's considered- Pt's hearing normalized over hospital
course. Based on high probability of overlap syndrome of
Sjogren's (+anti-Ro, dental caries, conjunctival injection,
swelling of cheeks, though no c/o of dry eyes/dry mouth) and SLE
(+[**Doctor First Name **], renal disease, ?pericardial disease, +family history),
started prednisone 30 daily and plaquenil 400 daily. Will taper
prednisone to 10 daily over 2 weeks and f/u with rheumatology
clinic.
.
Hypertension: BP initially elevated in setting of volume
overload. Normalized after increasing metoprolol to 100 tid.
Resumed home meds post HD to control BP (amlodipine, metoprolol,
and lisinopril), increased metoprolol dose from 75 to 100 tid.
During and after cath, BP extremely well controlled even without
BP meds. Instructed pt to use BP machine that she has at home to
decide when to use BP meds. If SBP<100, not to use. If>100, use
