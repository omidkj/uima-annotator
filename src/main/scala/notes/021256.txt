Conclusions
Pre Bypass: Patient is in A flutter. No left atrial appendage
thrombus, velocities in LAA > 20 cm/s. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation.

Post Bypass: Pateint is AV paced on Phenylepherine infusion.
Preserved biventricular function and wall motion. LVEF 55%. No
change in valvular function. Aortic contours intact. Reamaining
exam is unchanged. All findings discussed with surgeons at the
time of the exam.


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**2152-1-23**] for heparin bridge and surgical evaluation.
On [**1-24**] he was brought to the operating room and underwent
coronary artery bypass graft surgery, see operative report for
further details.  He received cefazolin for perioperative
antibiotics and was transferred to the intensive care unit for
post operative management.  In the first twenty four hours he
was weaned from sedation, awoke, and was extubated without
complications.  On postoperative day one he was started on
diuresis and beta blockers.  He was doing well and was
transferred to the floor for the remainder of his care.
Physical therapy worked with him on strength and mobility.  On
post operative day three he went into atrial flutter in
controlled rate and was treated with beta-blockers and
amiodarone.  Coumadin was resumed.  He was discharged home on
POD 5 with appropriate follow up instructions.
