Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred from OSH on [**2168-6-5**] and admitted to the MICU

Respiratory distress:  An extensive infectious and inflammatory
workup was conducted to delineat the etiology of the respiratory
distress.  Initial working assumption was exposure based failure
given new lawn chemical, rash, myalgia and rapid decline.  Acute
interstitial pneumonitis high on differential.   VATS on [**6-6**]
with inflammatroy thickening but no infectious etiology for the
lung changes.  The patients' ARDS worsened and she remained
intubated on high levels of ventillatory support throughout her
hospiatlization and ultimately until her death.

MICU:  during her hospitalizations, Mrs [**Known lastname **] developed sepsis
and complications from the bacteremia such as diffuse
intravascular coagulopathy, anemia, and worsening respiratory
failure.  These consequences were managed with IV fluid,
antibiotics, various ventilatory modes, and standard ICU
prophylaxis techniques.

The ICU team worked closely with the family to determine goals
of care and ultimately the family decided on comfort measures
only.  She was continued on a morphine drip and passed away on
