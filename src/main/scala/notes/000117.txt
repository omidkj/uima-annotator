Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course: 88 yo M with CAD, AF on coumadin, CHF,
presenting with guaiac-positive stool, treated for GI bleed,
with 2 MICU admission for hypotension, now stable.
.
# GI bleed: After reversal of her INR with vitamin K the patient
underwent EGD, colonoscopy and capsule study.  EGD showed an AVM
which was cauterized. The colonoscopy showed polyps which were
not removed. Capsule study showed nonbleeding red spots.  The
decision was made for the patient not to restart
anticoagulation.  He should have repeat colonoscopy and
enteroscopy as an out-patient. The patient's PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1007**] will
help arrange for this.
.
#AFib: The patient was continued on digoxin. Metoprolol was held
during episodes of hypotesion but was restarted and tolerated
well. Anti-coagulation was defered to the out-patient setting.
.
#chronic systolic CHF: Initially the patient was slightly volume
overloaded (with crackles and pedal edema on exam).  While NPO
the patient was diuresed and exam was euvolemic. As his
creatinine was then elevated, diuretics then stopped prior to
colonoscopy.  After colonoscopy patient became septic so patient
was given fluids and became further volume overloaded. On
transfer to ICU, bumetanide, spironolactone, metoprolol,
lisinopril held.  Digoxin was continued. On discharge the
patient was breathing comfotably and satting well on room air.
.
#Septic Shock: After colonoscopy/EGD/capsule study the patient
was febrile and hypotensive.  This prompted an ICU transfer.
Blood cultures grew MRSA in [**4-14**] bottles in 12hrs.  The source
felt to possibly be left lower extremity ulcer and/or right
wrist abscess.  A TTE did not show valvular lesions to suggest
endocarditis. The patient was discharged to the floor without
the need for pressors in the ICU. The patient again had an
episode of low-grade hypotension prompting an ICU transfer.
However, the patient remained stable off pressors and was
transfered back to the floor. The patient was restarted on his
metoprolol and continued on his ACE-inhibitor without further
episodes of hypotension. The patient is to be continued on a 14
day course of vancomycin (day 1=[**4-29**]) for the bacteremia.
.
#CAD: The patient was continued on his statin. His aspirin was
held given the GI bleed. Re-addition of aspirin was deferred to
the out-patient setting. The patient's beta-blocker and ACE were
added back as his pressure tolerated, as above.
.
# Aspiration pneumonia: On the patient's second transfer to the
ICU as above an chest X-ray demonstrated a possible right sided
infiltrate. There was some question of aspiration at the time.
The patient was started on a ten day course of
levofloxacin/flagyl (day 1=[**5-4**]).
.
# rash: The patient was seen by derm and diagnosed with likely
miliaria rubra. He was started on a one week course of
triamcinolone. He was also found to have several actinic
keratoses on skin exam and was recommended to follow-up with
dermatology as an out-patient.
.
# BPH: The patient's flomax was held in the setting of
hypotension. Re-starting of the medication will be deferred to
the out-patient setting.
.
#Depression: The patient was continued on his home celexa.
.
#Hypothyroidism: The patient was continued on levothyroxine.
.
#Code: Full code, discussed with patient and family
