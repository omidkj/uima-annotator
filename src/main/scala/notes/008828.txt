Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
speech difficulty

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2107-5-26**] left parietal crani for tumor biopsy


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 1123**] [**Known lastname 51820**] is a 79-year-old right-handed woman, with
remote history of stage I breast cancer in the right breast,
status post lumpectomy, and radiotherapy [**2092**], who presented to
BTC yesterday with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] for new finding of left parietal
mass
on workup for speech difficulty.  Her neurological problem began
during [**Name (NI) **] time in [**2106-12-16**] when she experienced
non-specific headache.  A head CT showed no abnormality and her
headache was thought to be from shingles. Her headache resolved
over time.  In mid-[**2107-4-17**], she developed subacute onset of
"mixing her words" as noted by her family members.  She saw Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2107-5-12**] and a
head MRI performed elsewhere on [**2107-5-13**] showed a mass in the
left inferior parietal brain.  On [**2107-5-18**], she experienced
lightheadedness and lost the ability to stand.  Her family
called
911 and the ambulance brought her to the emergency department at
[**Hospital1 69**].  She was hospitalized and
a
gadolinium-enhanced head MRI from [**2107-5-20**] showed a cystic
enhancing mass in the inferior left parietal brain.  CT of the
torso was negative for masses.  During her hospitalization she
became agitated and anxious.  Oxazepam helped but sons are
reporting that it wears off in mid-day.  She was discharged home
on [**2107-5-20**] for follow up in BTC [**2107-5-23**] and she was referred
to
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**5-24**].

She has been without evidence of breast cancer disease since
lumpectomy and radiation therapy in [**2092**].

15. history of multiple prior UTIs, most recently in [**2106-4-16**] (E coli, treated with Cipro).

Social History:
She lives alone in [**Location (un) 2312**]. Husband died of cancer in [**2103**].
Smoked 10 yrs but quit [**2055**], no EtOH, no illicit drugs.


Family History:
Her parents are deceased; her mother had
diabetes and [**Name (NI) 2481**] disease while her father had stroke or
myocardial infarction.  Three of her sisters died of breast
cancer while one is alive with coronary artery disease and
kidney
cancer with pulmonary metastasis.

Physical Exam:
Physical Examination:  Temperature is 97.8 F.  Her blood
pressure
is 140/72.  Heart rate is 68.  Respiratory rate is 20.  She has
no pain.  Her skin has full turgor.  HEENT examination is
unremarkable.  Neck is supple and there is no bruit or
lymphadenopathy.  Cardiac examination reveals regular rate and
rhythms.  Her lungs are clear.  Her abdomen is soft with good
bowel sounds.  Her extremities do not show clubbing, cyanosis,
or
edema.

Neurological Examination:
She is awake, alert, and able to follow some but not all
commands.  She has a receptive aphasia with intact fluency but
poor repetition and comprehension.  She can name a watch but not
a tie.  There is no right-left confusion.  Cranial Nerve
Examination:  Her pupils are equal and reactive to light, 3 mm
to
2 mm bilaterally.  Extraocular movements are full; there is no
nystagmus or saccadic intrusion.  Visual fields are full to
confrontation.  Her face is symmetric.  Facial sensation is
intact bilaterally.  Her hearing is intact bilaterally.  Her
tongue is midline.  Palate goes up in the midline.
Sternocleidomastoids and upper trapezius are strong.  Motor
Examination:  She does not have a drift.  She can move all 4
extremities well and symmetrically.  Her muscle tone is normal.
Her reflexes are 0-1 and symmetric bilaterally.  Her ankle jerks
are absent.  Her toes are down going.  Sensory examination is
intact to touch and proprioception.  Coordination examination
does not reveal appendicular dysmetria or truncal ataxia.  Her
gait is waddling but not from muscle weakness.  She cannot do
tandem gait.

Discharge Exam:
Pt is alert oriented x2, incisionis c/d/i with monocrylsutures
superficially. face symmetric, PERRL, mild global aphasia, motor
[**5-21**], sensory intact


Pertinent Results:
[**2107-5-26**] MR HEAD W/ CONTRAST

***************

[**2107-5-25**] CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT)
PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: The cardiomediastinal and
hilar contours
are stable, with top normal heart size. The lungs are well
expanded and
clear, without consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
There is no pulmonary edema. Multiple mediastinal surgical clips
and intact sternotomy wires relate to prior CABG.

IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary pathology.

[**2107-5-25**] MR FUNCTIONAL BRAIN BY
No significant changes are demonstrated in the left temporal and
parietal
lesions with associated vasogenic edema. Limited study as only
language
paradigm could be obtained. One of the language activation areas
is in close proximity to the lesion along its anterosuperior
extent. The other language activation areas are not adjacent to
the lesion. There is mild medial displacement of the arcuate
fascicle by the lesion.

[**2107-5-25**] CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECO
1.  Centrally-necrotic enhancing masses in the left posterior
temporal and
parietal lobes, unchanged from the recent MR of [**2107-5-20**],
supplied by distal
branches of the left MCA and drained by tributaries to the left
vein of [**Last Name (un) 70890**].

2.  Mild perilesional edema and local mass effect upon the
occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle, but no associated
hemorrhage, unchanged from the recent MR.
3.  Significantly decreased caliber of the basilar artery with
2.5 mm
non-enhancing proximal-mid-basilar segment, new from [**2097-3-8**],
likely
representing interval development of severe steno-occlusive
disease.

[**2107-5-25**] Cardiovascular ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function. No clinically-significant valvular disease seen.

[**5-27**] Echo
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
