Chief Complaint:
venous stasis ulcer

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bilateral lower extremity debridement
s/p Split thickness skin graft with VAC placement [**2152-12-11**]


History of Present Illness:
76 yoM with h/o HTN, HL, dementia/anxiety presents for b/l LE
venous stasis ulcers of 3 years. Pt has had ulcers followed by
wound clinic for 7 months
with last visit 1 year ago and currently has had home VNA come
on a daily basis for dressing changes (unna boots, wet to dry
dressings, debridements, etc.) for the last 2 years. Pt states

ECHO:

The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 75%).
The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. [Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of tricuspid
regurgitation.] There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The aortic valve is not
well seen. There is at least moderate aortic valve stenosis. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe [4+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least
moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be underestimated due to
a very high right atrial pressure.] There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

PMIBI:

IMPRESSION:

1. Normal myocardial perfusion.

2. Normal left ventricular cavity size and systolic function.

3. Right ventricular enlargement with evidence of
pressure/volume overload.

CTA: R/O PE

IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolus.
2. No thoracic aorta dissection.
3. Pulmonary hypertension probably responsible for right heart
enlargement.
4. No pulmonary edema.
5. Calcification of aortic valve leaflets. Atherosclerotic
coronary
calcifications.
6. No pericardial effusion.
7. Bilateral small pleural effusions and mild adjacent bibasilar
atelectasis.
8. Mild bronchial wall thickening could be due to asthma.
9. Small amount of perihepatic free fluid.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 87601**] is a 76 yoM who was admitted to the hospital on [**11-24**]
for empiric IV antibiotics and possible wound debridement.
Preoperatively, the Geriatric service was consulted for
management and recommendations of patient's baseline dementia.
Patient was deemed cabable of consenting to procedures by
Psychiatry.  On [**11-29**], he was taken to the operating room for
bilateral leg debridement. OR cultures grew MRSA sensitive to
Vancomycin and proteus sensitive to Unasyn and his antibiotics
coverage was narrowed.
In the am of POD 1, the patient became tachycardic, hypoxic, and
hypotensive. His blood pressure improved with fluid bolus and
patient was transferred to the VICU for closer monitoring. A few
hours later he became hypotensive and tachycardic again,
requiring fluid rescuscitation. EKG showed ST depressions, a
Cardiology consult was called, and patient was transferred to
the CVICU. Echocardiogram showed a dilated, hypokinetic RV with
EF 70%. He ruled out for PE. Troponins peaked at 0.11.  Per
Cardiology, no need for cardiac catheterization. He was
transferred back to the floor on POD 2.
On [**12-7**], antibiotics were switched to PO Bactrim and
cefpodoxine. Plastic Surgery was consulted for skin graft. A
preoperative echocardiogram and a persantine stress test were
done as part of cardiac clearance to return to the OR again for
skin grafting. He was cleared from a cardiac perspective and on
[**12-11**] he returned to the operating room for further debridement
and split thickness skin graft with VAC placement with Plastic
Surgery(Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]) . Mr. [**Known lastname 87601**] had an uneventful
postoperative course with good pain control. Foley was replaced
on [**12-12**] for urinary retention. Flomax was started and foley was
removed at midnight [**12-13**]. Pt voiding adequate amounts on
discharge. VAC is to stay in place until arrangements are made
by Plastic Surgery for pt to return for VAC change in the
operating room (1
