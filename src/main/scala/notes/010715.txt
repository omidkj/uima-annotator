Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**].  He was immediately typed and
crossed for multiple units of blood, platelets and FFP.  He was
taken to the OR immediately for emergent splenectomy.

OPERATIVE REPORT
INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY:  This is a 75-year-old male who
presented from an outside hospital with hemodynamic shock.
His history of myeloproliferative disorder was known and he
had a CAT scan done at the outside institution which revealed
severely injured and spontaneous rupture of his spleen, as
well as significant amount of free fluid in the abdomen. Upon
arrival to the [**Hospital6 256**] he had a
hematocrit of 23, heart rate of 130 and blood pressure of
80/40. It was decided to bring the patient emergently to the
operating room.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was placed in the supine
position on the operating room table. A left subcostal
incision was used and brought over slightly to the right of
the midline. Dissection was carried down to the fascia to the
muscles. The peritoneum was identified and opened up.
Approximately 2 L of old and new blood quickly was suctioned
out from the abdomen. The spleen appeared to be significantly
enlarged and was actively bleeding. It was clear that a
portion of the spleen had ruptured. Using left hand, the
ligamentous attachment to the spleen to the diaphragm and the
posterior peritoneum, as well as the kidney were bluntly
dissected free. The stomach was then retracted medially and
the gastrosplenic ligament was taken down. Any of the vessels
which were encountered in this ligament were tied in
continuity with 3-0 silk ties. The lesser sac was also
entered to aid in visualization. The remainder of the
posterior attachments were taken bluntly with the left hand.
The spleen was brought into the wound. The tail of the
pancreas could be easily seen into the splenic hilum. The
splenic hilar vessels were then taken using [**Doctor Last Name 1356**] clamps. The
vessels were doubly ligated with a 0 Vicryl tie and then a 2-
0 suture ligature. Care was taken not to injure the tail of
the pancreas. Some omental attachments were also taken off
the spleen. The spleen was then removed and passed off the
field. At this point, there was no evidence of any active
bleeding. Copious amounts of irrigation were used in the left
upper quadrant. There was a mild diffuse ooze from the
posterior abdominal wall. This was packed off. The remainder
of the abdomen was inspected. There was free fluid over the
liver which was old blood and was suctioned out and
irrigated. There was some old blood in the pelvis which was
suctioned out and irrigated.
Attention was then placed again to the left upper quadrant
where there was still slight diffuse ooze. Layers of Surgicel
were placed and the area was packed again. After examination
in 2 minutes it appeared that the bleeding had stopped. The
stomach was visualized. There was no evidence of any bleeding
from the short gastrics. The pancreas was visualized and
examined and there was no evidence of injury to the tail of
the pancreas. The colon was examined where the splenocolic
ligament was divided. There was no evidence of injury to the
colon. The sponge and instruments were all removed. The
abdomen was closed. The posterior layer of the fascia along
with the peritoneum was closed with running #1 PDS suture.
The anterior fascial layer was closed with interrupted 0
Vicryl suture. The skin was closed using staples. Needle and
sponge count were correct. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5182**] was present and
scrubbed for the entire operation. The patient was
transferred to the ICU in guarded condition.

post-op the patient was transferred to the ICU for further
management

Neuro: Initially the patient was kept sedated until he was ready
for extubation.  Post-extubation he did exhibit signs and
symptoms of delirium.  Geriatrics was consulted and we followed
their advice.  We limited narcotics, benzos, and restraints.  He
gradually improved and was back to his baseline prior to
transfer to the floor

Cardiovascular:  Post-op he was tachycardiac into the 160s.  EKG
showed what appeared to be multifocal atrial tachcardia.  His
Rate was controlled with IV lopressor and then PO once he was
tolerating a diet.  Eventually his HR decreased to the 80s after
titrating up his PO lopressor significantly.

Pulm: He was extubated POD 1 and did well.  He did require a few
doses of IV lasix over the course of his hospital stay to
decrease some pulmonary edema he developed from his aggressive
resuscitation.  Eventually he was weaned to room air, and did
not have any further complications.

GI: He was kept NPO with a NGT initially.  Once he began passing
gas and moving his bowels, his NGT was removed.  He was started
on sips and slowly advanced to a regular diabetic diet.  His
abdomen became less distended and he was more comfortable.

GU: Foley was kept in place until we felt he had diuresed
enough.  The catheter was removed and his urine was sent
multiple times for UA and culture due to the cloudy appearence
of it.  His cultures to date have all been negative.  Due to his
questionably positive UA, he was treated emiprically with 3 days
of PO Cipro.

Heme: His hematologist did see [**Last Name (un) **] initially when he came into
the hospital and made some recommendations.  He did require a
few more units of platelets due to his drifiting platelet count.
 Once his bleeding risk was no longer high, we decreased our
threshold for transfusion to 20,000 as he appeared to be at his
baseline.  He was vaccinated prior to discharge

ID: He was given a few doses of Keflex for what appeared to
intially be a wound infection but later appeared to be dependent
erythema.  He was also given 3 days of cipro for empiric UTI
treatment.  He never had any positive cultures

Endo:  Initially was on SSI.  Once he was taking POs he was
started back on his home regimen of glyburide and metformin.

Dispo: PT was consulted and they believed that he was strong
enough to go home with a home safety evaluation and some home
PT.  He did not require rehab at this point.
he was instructed to follow up with Surgery and Hematology in
the next few weeks.

PATHOLOGY REPORT
DIAGNOSIS:

1.  SPLENOMEGALY WITH EXTENSIVE EXTRAMEDULLARY HEMATOPOIESIS
CONSISTENT WITH CHRONIC MYELOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDER. SEE NOTE.
2.  CAPSULAR DISRUPTION CONSISTENT WITH SPLENIC RUPTURE.

3.  MULTIFOCAL SPLENIC INFARCTIONS, OLD.
Note:  There is extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis. This
finding, combined with massive splenomegaly, is consistent with
a chronic myeloproliferative disorder. Reportedly, the patient
