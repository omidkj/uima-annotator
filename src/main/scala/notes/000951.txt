Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization [**2145-8-18**], placement of 2 drug-eluting
stents to LAD, and 1 drug-eluting stent to the RCA.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6164**] is a 45 yo male w/o known CAD with an aspirin allergy
who presented to his PCP yesterday for 2 weeks of intermittent
chest pain.  His PCP did an ECG that showed ST depressions in
V1-V5 and he was sent to the ED at [**Hospital3 **].  By time he arrived
at the ED, his pain had resolved.  No medications were given at
that time.  He had one episode of chest pain overnight which
also resolved without treatment.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for aspirin desensitization and cardiac catheterization.

He describes his chest pain as a pressure in the upper chest
("like someone is standing on me") that lasts about 3-5 minutes
and resolves on its own.  His initial episode was two weeks ago
during light activity (walking around).  His next episode was a
few days later and he began having chest pain episodes more
often (up to about 3 per day) and having pain at rest.  He
states that during one episode a few days ago, he had a cough
that was productive for slightly blood-tinged saliva.  Yesterday
morning he went to work and his friends convinced him to call
his PCP.

At [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, he was given 5000 units SC heparin, 70mg
SC Lovenox, and Plavix 300mg po.  1st set of enzymes was CPK
236, CKMB 3.2, Troponin I 0.06 (indeterminate per their lab).
2nd set CPK 200, CKMB 2.8, Troponin I 0.08 (also indeterminate).
 Third set 180, 2.5, and 0.04 (also indeterminate).  He also had
a normal CXR and CT that showed emphysematous changes but no
evidence of PE.

He has a very strong family history for premature CAD with his
sister having a MI at age 42 and his father having multiple [**Name (NI) 5290**]
beginning in his 50's.

On review of systems, he denies any fever, chills, headaches,
weakness, numbness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or
hematuria.  He endorses one episode of left side pain at the OSH
due to "sitting in one place too long" that resolved with 2mg IV
morphine.  All of the other review of systems were negative.

Past Medical History:
Herniated disc in back
Emphysema - diagnosed after he had an episode of pneumonia,
reports his exercise tolerance is high and he can "walk forever
and run with my kids"

Social History:
Lives in [**Location 2498**], MA with his wife and son (age 13). Previously
smoked cigarettes extensively (2-3ppd for 30 years), quit 1.5
years ago, now continues to smoke some cigars (states he will
completely quit after this hospitalization).   Denies EtOH or
illicit drug use.  Works as an iron worker.

Family History:
He has a very strong family history for premature CAD with his
sister having a MI at age 42 and his father having multiple [**Name (NI) 5290**]
beginning in his 50's.

CT Chest at OSH: No CT evidence of pulmonary thromboembolism.
Emphysematous changes.

Cardiac cath [**2145-8-18**]:
Coronary angiography in this right dominant system demonstrates
two vessel disease.  The LMCA had no angiographically apparent
disease.  The LAD had an 80% stenosis in the mid-portion of the
vessel.  The D1 had a 70% stenosis at the origin.  The Cx had
minor luminal irregularities on angiography.  The RCA had a 70%
stenosis in the mid portion of the vessel.  Patient received two
Endeavor 3.0 drug-eluting stents to the LAD and an Endeavor 3.5
drug-eluting stent to the RCA.

TTE [**2145-8-18**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  Patient was admitted for two weeks
of intermittent escalating chest pain.  On admission, he was
chest pain free and had ECG changes concerning for ACS (T waves
inversions and ST depressions in precordial leads).  It was felt
that his symptoms were consistent with unstable angina and he
was scheduled for cardiac catheterization the next morning.  He
was started on a heparin gtt, metoprolol 12.5mg po bid,
atorvastatin 80mg po daily.  His PTT was at goal approximately 8
hours after initiating heparin.
    Early the morning after admission, the patient experienced
an episode of chest pain.  An ECG was obtained which showed ST
elevation in leads V1-V4.  His pain resolved with administration
of SL nitro x 3 and morphine.  He was then started on
integrillin gtt, nitro gtt, and given Plavix 75mg.  Later that
morning, he was taken for cardiac catheterization and found to
have 70% stenosis of the LAD and 80% stenosis of the RCA.  He
received 2 DES to the LAD and 1 DES to the RCA.  He had no
complications during the procedure.  After the procedure, he was
chest pain free and remained chest pain free throughout his
admission.  A follow-up TTE showed normal heart function.
    His cardiac markers remained negative throughout his
admission, and his chest pain and ST elevations had resolved
quickly with SL nitro and morphine.  Therefore, it was felt that
the patient's chest pain was best attributable to coronary
vasospasm.  Therefore, his medications were sw
