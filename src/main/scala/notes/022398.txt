Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Dilantin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
Variceal bleeding

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD

History of Present Illness:
58 year old male with past medical history of alcoholic
cirrhosis complicated by gastric varices and recurrent GI
bleeding, myelodysplastic syndrome, radiation proctitis after
XRT for prastate cancer and JRA presented to [**Location (un) 2274**] today for
screening endoscopy and colonoscopy. Colonoscopey was not done
but endoscopy showed hypertensive gastropathy and villous
mucosa/?Barrett's at GE junction. A biopsy was taken but
complicated by profuse bleeding which was not amenable to
epinephrine injection or clipping due to poor visualization.
.
He was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further
management. In the ED, he was intubated for airway protection.
Initial vitals were 177/72 87 100% on FiO2 100% PEEP of 5 RR: 14
and Vt: 500. OG tube suction showed dark blood. He was given
octreotid bolus.
Intubated. Pulse: 87. RR:14. FiO2100% BP:177/72. Bolused
octreotide and started on 2 units of O negative blood
transfusion. He was subsequently transferred to MICU.
.
In the MICU he received 2 units of pRBC, 1 unit of platelets and
1 unit of FFP. Right IJ trauma line was placed without any
complications. EGD showed clotted of bleed at GE junction which
could be variceal or arterial.

Alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by gastric varices and
encephalopathy
Myelodysplastic syndrome
Radiation proctitis
Total hip replacement
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis
Seizures


Social History:
Unable to obtain as he was intubated.  Per Atrius records never
smoked.

CXR:
Low lung volumes accentuate prominence of the pulmonary
vasculature. Endotracheal tube in appropriate location.

CT Head:
No CT evidence for acute intracranial hemorrhage.

CT C-spine:
Degenerative changes of the cervical spine without evidence for
for fracture, normal alignment.

RUQ U/S:
1. Markedly dilated, but patent portal vein with biphhasic,
helical flow.
2. Patent paraumbilical vein and varices due to portal
hypertension.
3. Patent hepatic veins.
4. Gallstone, but no acute cholecystitis.
5. 4.6 x 4.3 cm anechoic cystic lesion at the porta hepatis,
likely represents a liver cyst off the caudate lobe.
.
[**10-23**] MRI:  IMPRESSION:
1. Early subacute infarcts in bilateral frontal, parietal, right
posterior
temporal and occipital lobes, right thalamus and right superior
cerebellar
vermis. These are of different chronicity and likely
thromboembolic in
etiology.
2. Generalized cerebral atrophy with extensive changes of
chronic small
vessel ischemic disease.
3. The right temporalis muscle is slightly enlarged in size and
appears
hyperintense on FLAIR images, this may represent edema or
myositis.

EEG [**2141-10-24**]: IMPRESSION: This EEG continues to show an
exceptionally active paroxysmal epileptiform abnormality in the
right occipital pole in the context of a continuous focal delta
disturbance suggestive of a large
structural lesion in that region. There are superimposed fairly
frequent electrographic seizures that are now spreading to the
left
homolygous hemipsheric regions but with no obvious clinical
accompaniment.

EEG [**2141-10-25**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU
video EEG study due to paroxysmal at times periodic epileptiform
discharges in the right occipital pole in the context of a
continuous focal delta activity
suggestive of a large structural lesion in that region. There
are
superimposed intermittent electrographic seizures that
occasionally
spread to the left homologous hemispheric regions but with no
obvious
clinical accompaniment. The seizures decreased in frequency and
amplitude towards the end of the recording. Background was
asymmetric
with delta slowing and suppression on the right and [**6-27**] Hz
posterior
dominant rhythm on the left.

EEG [**2141-10-26**]: IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU
video EEG study due to paroxysmal and, at times, periodic
epileptiform discharges in the right occipital pole in the
context of a continuous focal delta activity suggestive of a
large structural lesion in that region. There are
superimposed intermittent electrographic seizures but with no
obvious
clinical accompaniment. The seizures stopped after 17:52.
Background
was asymmetric with delta slowing and suppression on the right
and [**6-27**]
Hz posterior dominant rhythm on the left.

MR HEAD [**2141-10-26**]: IMPRESSION:
Limited study due to motion artefacts.
1. Multiple areas of restricted diffusion with associated FLAIR
and T2
hyperintensity in bilateral frontal, parietal, right posterior
temporal and occipital lobes, right thalamus and right superior
cerebellar vermis. The distribution of the lesions make the
possibility of these being infarcts more likely than being due
to seizures. These have not significantly changed since the
prior study. No evidence of hemorrhagic transformation of the
infarcts.
2. Generalized cerebral atrophy with extensive changes of
chronic small
vessel ischemic disease.

CTA HEAD AND NECK [**2141-10-27**]: IMPRESSION: Moderate atherosclerotic
calcifications of the cervical carotid bifurcations with no
evidence of critical stenosis.
There is no evidence of critical stenosis or aneurysms in the
circle of
[**Location (un) 431**]. Evolution of the bilateral parietal infarction, with
associated
vasogenic edema, producing effacement of the sulci on the right
par
