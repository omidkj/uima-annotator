Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
E-Mycin / Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal pain accompanied by Nausea and vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Dental Abscess Debridement
Tooth Extraction Procedure
Central line placement due to poor peripheral access.
IR-guided PICC line placement in R arm


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 28 year old type I and type II diabetic with right
mandibular abscess recently treated with 14-day course of
clindamycin, presents claiming to be in DKA, with blood sugars
at home [**Location (un) 1131**] greater than 600 mg/dL. Pt initially refused
central access. Multiple IV attempts were made, and patient was
found to have anion gap acidosis with elevated lactate and urine
ketones. Pt was started on insulin gtt at 10 U/hr and admitted
to the MICU.
.
In the MICU, insulin regimen was closely monitored by [**Last Name (un) **]
staff, and anion gap was closed. Pt was seen by oral surgeons,
and abscess was debrided and cultured on [**2111-1-24**], growing out
GPC, GPR, and GNR. Pt started on clindamycin and levofloxacin.
Pt had very poor peripheral access, and after much discussion
with patient and psychiatry consult, pt agreed to have central
line access for blood draws and medications. Central line was
successfully placed in R IJ and placement confirmed in SVC by
CXR. On morning of transfer at 8AM, pt was given full dose of
insulin although pt was not taking PO due to pain/nausea. Pt has
continued to refuse to take PO, and fingersticks have ranged
from 60-120 since the insulin dose. Insulin gtt was stopped and
all further insulin doses have been held. Pt was transferred to
medicine team in stable condition. Pt has had low urine output,
but is refusing Foley. Pt also has had no bowel movements in one
week.

         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.  UNASYN (AMPICILLIN/SULBACTAM) PER ID
