History of Present Illness:
79 woman with hx of dementia, COPD, hx of CVA here after
witnessed fall with L femeral neck fracture on [**2146-2-16**].  She fell
after sliiping on kitchen floor witnessed by son.  Was seen at
[**Hospital 65460**] [**Hospital **] Hospital and then transferred here for surgery.

While in ED was stable getting levofloxacine for UTI and
awaiting admission to ortho service and noted to have O2
requirement and overall negative CXR and CTA showed LLL PE.  Had
been given 2mg morphine for pain although not really
communicating however BP noted to be elevated.  Seen by PCP for
medical clearance/evaluation and was 91% on 4L at time taking
rapid shallow breaths.  Then noted to drop sats to 70's off O2,
with tachypnea, tachycardic and hypertension.  Noted to be
guiaic positive when starting heparin for LLL PE.  Repeat CXR
consistent with some fluid overload vs RLL infiltrate and was
started on nitro gtt, lasix, and clinda for possible aspiration
coverage.

Started on BIPAP 8/5/60%. She was comfortable on the mask,
follows voice, but does not speak full words/sentences.

At baseline does not ambulate except about 10 feet with
assiatance of care taker, not limited by CP, SOB or other
cardiac symptoms.  No hx of heart disease.

Studies:
CXR [**2146-2-22**] - Heterogeneous opacification of the right lung has
progressed due in part to the overlay of a dependent
small-to-moderate right pleural effusion, but also suggests
extensive pneumonia or less likely asymmetric pulmonary edema.
There is also new consolidation at the left lung base suggesting
another area of infection. Heart is normal size. Severe
emphysema is present.

PEG [**2146-2-23**] - Successful placement of a 12-French Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 12433**]
gastrostomy tube with located in good position in the stomach.
No feeding should be performed through the gastrostomy tube for
24 hours. If after 24 hours the patient has no signs or symptoms
of peritonitis then feeding can be started at half of normal
rate. If the patient tolerated the feeding, it can be progressed
to normal rate in the subsequent 24 hours.

Hip [**2146-2-22**] - Limited study. Interval placement of a left hip
hemiarthroplasty, without prosthetic dislocation. No fracture.

IVC [**2146-2-21**] - Successful placement of a Venatech filter in the
infrarenal portion of IVC.

CT head [**2146-2-17**] - No evidence of hemorrhage or fracture. Chronic
changes including atrophy, old infarction or contusion, and
extensive periventricular white matter hypodensity.

Hip [**2146-2-17**] - Complete, displaced, left femoral neck fracture.
Old fracture involving the base of the right fifth metatarsal.
Mild-to-moderate right hip osteoarthritis.

CTA chest [**2146-2-17**] - 1) Small, isolated subsegmental pulmonary
embolism in the RLL. 2) Chronic emphysematous changes. 3)
Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.


Brief Hospital Course:
79 yo woman with COPD, dementia and osteoarthritis here after
mechanical fall with right femoral neck fracture now s/p SVC
filter placement, ORIF, and PEG placement.

HEME:
Acute drop in Hct from 28.4 to 24.1 on [**2-19**]:
- On exam, pt. is guiac +
- etiology of anemia: femur fracture vs. GI bleed
- Pt transfused 1 unit PRBC's with hct jump from 24.1 to 27.9
- Serial crits stable thereafter
- IVC filter placed given PE's; pt maintained off heparin gtt
until after ORIF when started on lovenox 30 mg daily w/o further
drop in hct
- GI consult - pt not a candidate for EGD as likely no
intervention given her DNR/DN

PULM:
Initial Respiratory Distress: likley secondary to anxiety in
setting of pain and also some degree of COPD exacerbation from
acute event or possible aspiration PNA.  PE found in isolated
subsegmental pulmonary embolism in the RLL on [**2-17**] CT (no A-a
gradient c/w PE, but may be source of some discomfort and
respiratory distress.  With aggitation patient becomes
hypertensive and may have increased pulmonary edema vs
aspiration event.
- She was initially started on Levofloxacin on [**2146-2-17**] for
possible aspiration PNA which was changed to zosyn/vanco for a 7
day course on [**2146-2-22**] for increased secretions.
- She was intubated for ORIF and stayed intubated until after
PEG placement.  Intially after extubation she had to be
aggessively suctioned to remove mucus plug. Pt satting well
after plug removal.
- plan to decrease O2 as tolerated
- d/c albuterol given tachycardia & continue atrovent

MUSCULOSKELETAL: - ORIF femur without complication
- weight bearing as tolerated
- Lovenox started [**2146-2-21**]. Plan for 30 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 1week and then
change to 40 mg daily.
- Pain control with morphine, but follow delerium and
respiratory status.
- PT working with pt

NEURO:
Anxiety/AMS:
- No focal neuro deficit noted
- Pt somnulent at times thought to be secondary to morphine,  at
times requiring restraints. Pt has pulled out NGT and has
attempted to pull out IV lines.
- Patient responding well to Zytis prn and morphine for pain
- monitor EKG QT

CARDIOVASCULAR:
- Pt hypertensive and tachycardic at times. Etiology is likely
combination of agitation and pain.  ECG's show sinus, MAT and
Afib.
- titrating up BB as tolerated; currently at 37.5 mg tid

Previous HTN: likely related to anxiety and pain as no hx of
HTN. Pt originally placed on nitro drip, which was changed to
nitro paste and now B-B.

FEN: - PEG placement by IR without complication
- started using PEG [**2146-2-22**]; Started half strength feeds x24 hrs
then increased to full strength

Proph: lovenox as above (change to 40 mg daily on [**2146-2-27**]), ppi

Code: Now pt is DNR/DNI, code changed to full for OR for 48
hours only.
