Left Foot Ulcer

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 67 yo M with PMH of HTN/Hyperlipidemia/DM on
insulin, CAD s/p multiple MIs and CABG in [**2187**], PVD, CVA, atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, ESRD s/p LRRT in [**2181**] on cyclosporine,
and CHF with LVEF=30% recently admitted in [**2-/2193**] for volume
overload/CHF now presents with infected heel ulcer.
.
During admission in [**2-/2193**], his heel ulcers were noted and
evaluation at that time was negative for infection. He was seen
by podiatry, vascular and wound care. He was discharged to rehab
and during this time, he states that the wound worsened. he also
continued to follow-up with vascular surgery as outpatient. He
was treated with Keflex for nearly one month for apparent
infection of the left heel ulcer.  Two weeks ago, he was started
on ciprofloxacin and has just finished a course. On Sunday
([**8-18**]) prior to admission, while standing on the foot, he
started bleeding profusely through the bandage. His wife was
able to stop the bleeding and he did not seek medical attention.
Then, today on day of admission ([**8-19**]), he went to a scheduled
appointment to have hyperbaric oxygen treatment for his ulcers,
but at that appointment, his left foot ulcers were noted to be
necrotic with large eschar and foul smell. He was sent the the
OSH ED and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] due to his history of care
here.
.
At the OSH ED hreceived IV levofloxacin. In [**Hospital1 **] ED, T 96.3, HR
68, BP 99/59, RR18, 97%RA. He received Vanc X 1, cyclosporine,
lipitor, and morphine 4 mg X 1. Pulses were dopplerable.
.
On the floor, he reports feeling fatigued but otherside at
baseline. He checks temp every day and is always at 96.7. He
denies and fever, chills, abd pain, N/V, cough. He does
occasionally feel pain in his feet in certain positions. No
diarrhea, CP, palpiatations. ROS toherwise negatve.

Brief Hospital Course:
Vascular Surgery Course:

Mr. [**Known lastname 12863**] is a 68 year old man with CKD V now s/p failed renal
transplant who was initially admitted to the medical service on
[**2193-8-20**] with osteomyelitis of his left heel. He required
transfer to the MICU for progressive renal failure resulting in
reinitiation of renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and withdrawl
of immunosuppressants, worsening hypotension requiring
norepinephrine infusion, a brief GI bleed which has yet to be
worked up, and progression of his left heel ulcer ultimately
culminating in a below-the-knee amputation on [**2193-9-16**] at which
time he was transferred from the MICU service to the CVICU.
Post-operatively, he had been doing well with a resolution in
his oxygen requirement.  He was initially put on vancomycin,
ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole for empiric coverage for his
osteomyelitis.  He was noted to have a pre-operative blood
culture from [**2193-9-14**] which grew VRE; linezolid was written for
on [**2193-9-20**] though the patient has yet to receive a dose.  Also
of note, he had been on a heparin drip for anticoagulation given
his atrial fibrillation; the morning of his re-transfer, his PTT
was noted to be >150 seconds and his heparin drip was
discontinued at 11am.  At approximately 1pm today, the patient
was noted to be unresponsive shortly after being given a tray of
food.  He was presumed to have aspirated and was emergently
intubated.  A subsequent bronchoscopy found masticated food
partciles in his airways which were suctioned out.  For ongoing
management of his respiratory failure, he was transferred back
to the MICU service.

PLAN:
# Diabetic ulcer: Initial concern for ostemyolitis by xray.
ESR/CRP 76/173. The patient was initially started on vancmycin
and zosyn which was quickly changed to vancomycin/unasyn.
Vascular surgery and podiatry consults were placed.  Blood
cultures were negative. Superficial wound cultures were positive
for MRSA. Podiatry noted bone exposure and recommended [**Hospital1 **]
dressing changes but felt intervention was not possible without
vascular assessment. LENIs were w/o evidence of DVTs and
non-invasive vascular studies demonstrated on doralis pulse and
only monophasic flow through the L popliteal artery. The patient
underwent an angiogram of the left leg which showed good blood
flow to the left heel.  All abx were stopped on [**9-11**].  Went to
the OR on [**9-16**] with Vascular surgery for BKA.

#Acute on chronic renal failure/ESRD s/p failed renal
transplant: The patient was s/p LRRT in [**2181**] and was on
immunosuppressive therapy for this transplant.  On arrival, the
patient was found to be in renal failure, with a creatinine of
3.7. Urine lytes were consistant with a pre-renal etiology.  The
patient's diurectic therapy (Bumex) was discontinued.  The
patient was followed by transplant team and his kidney function
worsened over his initial hospital course.  Renal ultrasound was
concerning for graft rejection vs. ATN.  His home regimen of
immunosupression (prednisone, cyclosporin, azathioprine) was
decreased.  It was felt that the patient's renal function was
related to his poor Cardiac output and it was suspe
