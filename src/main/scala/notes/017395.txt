Chief Complaint:
STEMI

History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia who
is transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for cath after presenting
with chest pain. Chest pain was described as L-sided chest
tightness, [**6-29**], occuring 1 hour prior to presentation to OSH
while pt was breaking up ice with sledge hammer in front of
house. Pain was associated with L hand and wrist weakness,
diaphoresis, and improved with lying down. Pt subsequently
called for taxi cab, which brought him to [**Hospital1 **]. No nausea or
shortness of breath. Same symptoms persisted at rest. There is
no history of exertional dyspnea, PND, orthopnea, presyncope,
very active, normally jogging 1 mile 4 days a week during the
summer. He went jogging 4 hours prior to the onset of chest
pain.
.
In the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], initial vitals were T:98.6 HR:57 BP:174/86
RR:16 O2Sat:99% RA. Patient had taken ASA 650mg PO at home. He
received a heparin bolus and was started on heparin gtt. He also
received Atorvastatin 80mg PO x 1, Plavix 600mg PO x 1, Nitro SL
x 2 with improvement of CP to [**12-30**]. CXR showed no acute
findings. Pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath and further
management.
.
In the cath lab, RCA mid-segment occlusion was stented x Xience
DES x3. Pt had questionable episode of complete heart block vs.
?vagal response during procedure, and required RV temporary
transvenous pacing, now removed with block resolved.

COMMENTS:     1.  Selective coronary angiography in this right
dominant
patietn revealed two vessel CAD.  The LMCA was normal and the
LAD had
mild luminal irregularities.  The LCX had two serial 70-80%
lesions with
some haziness.  The RCA had mid vessel acute occlusion with
thrombus.
2.  Resting hemodynamics with BP 144/61 with HR 46 in sinus with

episodes of heart block treated with pacemaker.  Patient had
transient
AIVR after dottering the RCA for about 5 seconds. Right heart
cath with RA 18mmHG, RV 39/13, PA 39/23, PCWP 22.  The PA sat
was 64% and cardiac index was 1.7.  These findings are
consistent with elevated filling pressures in left and right as
well as RV infarct physiology.
3.   Stenting of the RCA with 3 Xience stents from proximal to
distal
3.5x18 overlapped with 3.5x23 then a few mm gap followed by a
3x23.
4.   Plan for post MI care over weekend and then stenting of LCX
prior
to discharge.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute inferior STEMI with RV infarct
3. Stenting of RCA with 3 DES after thrombectomy

[**2195-1-16**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis. The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 40-45%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD.




Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 71 y/o M with history of hyperlipidemia, no prior
cardiac history, who presents with chest pain after exertion and
is found to have STEMI on EKG. Now s/p cath with stents x 3 to
RCA.

#. CAD: Pt was admitted with inferior STEMI and had cardiac
catheterization [**2195-1-15**] with [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 3 to RCA (culprit lesion).
His biomarkers trended down with CKs peak at 1409 on [**1-15**] and
TnT peaked at 5.82 on [**1-15**]. He did well post-procedure with
chest pain fully resolved. He was started on ASA 325 and Plavix
75 daily as well as metoprolol 25mg PO BID, atorvastatin 80
daily and lisinopril 10mg daily. He should have follow up stress
test in 1 month to evaluate LCx disease. He was also started on
diabetes management as discussed below.

#. Pump: Pt denies any previous ECHOs. No clinical signs/sx of
heart failure on exam. However, cath showed elevated PCWP (mean
22), and RAP approximating PCWP, indicating RV failure.
Clinically otherwise euvolemic.  He had echo on [**1-16**] which
showed mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
CAD and LVEF 40-45%. Will continue on lisinopril.

#. Hyperlipidemia: Pt is on Lipitor 10mg daily at home. Has not
seen his PCP for the past 15 years. Lipid profile with
significant HLD so atorvastatin was increased to 80mg daily for
hyperlipidemia as well as management of STEMI. He was seen by
nutrition for dietary counseling.

# Hyperglycemia: Pt has not seen his PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **] 15 years. Serum
blood sugars on admission were 300s. This is most likley
secondary to underlying untreated DM Type 2. HbA1c 11.2. He was
started on HISS and lantus which was uptitrated to 17units
qhs.FS improved to 100s with this re
