Chief Complaint:
Right facial twitching, neck contracting, and eyes rolling to

Lumbar puncture

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 12330**] is a 60 year old right handed woman with history of
end-stage renal failure secondary to polycystic kidney disease
(with renal and liver cysts) status post DCD renal transplant on
[**2175-6-16**] complicated by delayed graft function now off dialysis,
two previous subarachnoid hemorrhages([**2167**] and [**2169**]) secondary
to aneurysmal rupture status post clipping and
Ventriculoperitoneal shunt with residual aphasia, seizures and
history of convulsive seizures and nonconvulsive status,
presents with breakthrough seizures.   History taken from prior
records and Son at bedside.

She was recently admited from [**2176-6-11**] - [**2176-6-14**] for UTI;   She
had been treated for UTI for the past several weeks prior to
[**Hospital1 18**] admission on an outpatient basis, the initial leading
cause of fever was considered to be UTI. After obtaining
outpatient records of urine cultures and drug sensitivities, was
given Meropenem 500mg IV once, and then she was transitioned to
ceftazadime 1g q12h. She remained afebrile on these medications.

As for potential seizures, she reportedly had a seizure on night
prior to that admission, which including "twitching" thought to
be induced by her fever and infection. She was discharged this
past friday on bactrim (per renal as ongoing prophylaxis) and
ertapenem; for seizures, vimpat (150 mg [**Hospital1 **]) and levetiracetam
(1000/1250) were prescribed.  Of note, she has not missed any
doses of the medications.

On [**2176-6-20**], she began having frequent focal motor seizures, with
right facial twitching, neck contractions, eyes rolling up and
deviated to the right, lasting 1-5 minutes, with ability to
speak in between. They were only a few yesterday but today has
been almost persistent off and on throughout the day,
leading the family to bring her to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Could not be elicited from the patient,
however son
denies recent fevers (temp at home 98), nausea, vomiting,
changes in
bowels, cough, or SOB.

IMAGING:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or
other acute
process. Left frontal post-operative extra-axial thickening,
similar to
[**2175-11-5**]. Left temporoparietal encephalomalacia,
similar to prior. Right parietal approach VP shunt catheter
terminates in similar position to prior.

EEG [**2176-6-26**]
This is an abnormal continuous video EEG telemetry due to sharp
discharges over the left frontal and temporal leads. There were
no pushbutton activations and no electrographic seizures. The
background on the left hemisphere is continuous slowing in delta
range intermixed with breach rhythm.
