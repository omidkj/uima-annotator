Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
54 year old man with history of hep C, chronic extremity ulcers,
restrictive lung disease, recurrent PE who presents with
shortness of breath and confusion. The records of his inital
presentation are not clearly documented. He was at home with his
wife who found him with left sided back pain and minimal
responsiveness. She called EMS. When EMS arrived to his home, he
was hypoxic and met by his neighbors.
.
In the ED, his initial vitals were 98F, 118, 103/64, 25
86%RA->97%NRB. He received empiric lasix 80 IV x1, and
levofloxacin 500 mg x1. He was started on a nitroglycerin drip
but this was stopped when his [**First Name3 (LF) **] pressure dropped to 70s
systolic. An EKG was interpreted as sinus tach with no specific
ST-T changes. He voided 550 cc of brown urine without a foley.
He received an empiric heparin bolus of 5000 units but the
heparin was stopped when his INR came back at >10.
He was transfered for further evaluation.
ROS: he states that he had a fever 2 days ago. he denies cough
or chest pain. He denies abd pain but was having burning on
urination. Has pressure in his bladder. He has no rash.


Past Medical History:
1)? Buerger's disease vs. livedoid vasculopathy - Per prior
notes has had extensive work-ups by Dermatology, rheumatolgy,
plastics, etc. Essentially excluded a diagnosis of
cryoglobulinemia, while a presumptive diagnosis of Buerger's or

LV was made. The patient is on Nifedipine to increase
vasodilation and has been counseled to stop smoking many times.

2)Chronic bilateral U+L extremity ulcers - complication of his
vaculitis- ? pyoderma grangulosum
3)Chronic pain [**3-7**] multiple ulcers
4)Sinus tachycardia, presumed reflex sympathetic dystrophy
5)Remote history of testicular cancer in [**2092**] status post
orchiectomy, with recurrence in [**2101**] treated with XRT and LND.
6)Bilateral PEs [**2120-8-3**], on Coumadin
7)Hypersensitivity pneumonitis versus BOOP versus NSIP
(restrictive PFTs FEV1 57%, DSB 61% in [**1-8**])
8)Hypothyroidism
9)Hepatitis C (genotype 1) Grade inflammation 2, Stage 0
fibrosis [**4-10**]
10)GERD - on PPI at home
11)s/p MVA in [**2084**] with traumatic spleen rupture, bilateral
open tibial fractures, and head trauma.
12) influenza pneumonia [**2122-3-6**].


Social History:
1 ppd X 30 yrs. (+) history of IVDU, quit in [**2094**]. No ethanol
use. Lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 1411**]. Currently unemployed

Family History:
Grandfather s/p MI in 70s. Grandmother died in her sleep of
unknown cause in her 70s. No family history of cancer. Cousin
with anti-phospholipid antibody.

CXR - AP ([**Hospital1 **]-N): wedgeshaped pleural opacities in RLL and LLL
with air-bronchogram on LUL, pulmonary vessel engorgement.

CT chest - IMPRESSION: Findings compatible with multifocal
pneumonia. multiple pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph
nodes at multiple stations

ECHO TTE -
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF 60-70%) There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2121-4-24**], the findings are similar.
IMPRESSION: no obvious vegetations seen

         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.  PENICILLIN SENSITIVITY AVAILABLE ON
REQUEST.

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief, the patient is a 54 year old man with chronic upper
extremity ulcers of unknown etiology (vasculopathy),
interstitial lung disease, recurrent pulmonary embolism who
presented with hypoxia, altered mental status, acute renal
failure found to have multilobar pneumonia.

1) Hypoxia: The patient presented with bilateral infiltrates,
fever, and markedly elevated WBC count with bandemia and imaging
was consistent with a multilobar pneumonia.  Sputum cultures
revealed MRSA.  He was empirically started on cefepime and
vancomycin then trans
