Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Biventricular pacemaker with ICD

History of Present Illness:
71M with dilated CMY, EF20% (hospitalized in [**2127**] for CHF
thought to be due to medication noncompliance), no significant
CAD on cath in [**2123**], CKD (baseline Cr 1.8), HTN, gout, who has
had a chronic cough since [**2131-7-11**] that was treated with
increased Lasix and PPI. As per OMR notes, his cough abated with
the PPI and his Lasix dose was decreased to 80 [**Hospital1 **]. As per
patient's wife, he's had a chronic progressive cough since
[**Month (only) 216**], associated with PND and orthopnea, and yesterday had
increased SOB and DOE, palpitation and chills. She reports that
he hasn't been having CP, abdominal pain, or fevers. She also
denies him reporting hematochezia or melena. In Dr.[**Name (NI) 10697**]
clinic note yesterday, the patient had apparently been taking
Lisinopril, which was supposed to be stopped on account of renal
failure, and there is a question as to whether he was taking his
carvedilol.
.
She does report that last week he had some right hand swelling
that was thought to be due to gout.
.
In the ED he was intubated for SOB, SBP to 70 mmHg, and
bradycardia to 17bpm (as per cardiology note) responsive to
atropine. He was started on Norepinephrine and Dopamine for
cardiogenic shock, and given Levofloxacin for concern for
pneumonia related sepsis.
.
He also had a potassium of 7.6 for which he received calcium,
insulin, bicarbonate. Repeat K pending. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 10698**]. Uric Acid 14.

.
He had a CXR that showed no overt failure and correct placement
of a RIJ central line. He also had a noncontrast Chest CT that
was negative for aneursym or focal consolidation.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
ankle edema, syncope or presyncope

TTE ([**2132-1-8**]) - The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated.
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
15-20%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened and do not fully
coapt. A slightly-eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of severe
(4+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Quantitative evaluation of
mitral regurgitation demonstrates an effective regurgitant area
of 0.4 cm2 and a regurgitant volume of 47 ml/beat. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severely dilated left ventricle with severe global
systolic dysfunction. Severe secondary mitral regurgitation.
Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-9-18**],
the findings are similar (severity of MR may have beenslightly
underestimated).
.
CT-Torso ([**2132-1-8**]) - IMPRESSION:
1.  Non-contrast view of the aorta is unremarkable.  No evidence
of
mediastinal or retroperitoneal hematoma.
2.  Marked cardiomegaly.
3.  Nasogastric tube in high position with tip above the
gastroesophageal
junction and advancement suggested.
4.  Simple cholelithiasis.
5.  Left inguinal hernia contains small bowel without evidence
of
incarceration or obstruction.
6.  Hepatic and renal cysts as well as hypodensities too small
to
characterize.
7.  Intramuscular lipoma of the gluteus musculature on the left.
.
TTE ([**2132-1-18**]) - The left atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
severely dilated. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 20 %). There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed
free wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Severe (4+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2132-1-8**], the findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
71M with dilated cardiomyopathy with SOB admitted with
cardiogenic shock and intubated for respiratory distress, s/p
BIV-ICD placement
.
# Decompensated Systolic Heart failure: Initially, patient was
admitted in decompensated failure with severe pulmonary edema.
Patient required supportive therapy with milrinone and agressive
diuresis. Patient was weaned off ventilator and with ongoing
diuresis, able to maintain adequate oxygen saturation with
supplemental oxygen. Milrinone was also weaned off and patient
was able to tolerate re-initiation of cardiac medications.
Because of significant MR/TR and known dismotility, patient
underwent [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular ICD placement which he tolerated very
well. Patient will continue to follow in device clinic and with
Dr [**First Name (STitle) 437**], his primary cardiologist.
Please see medications section for details of discharge regimen.
.
# CAD/Ischemia: No known coronary artery disease. Patient
however was kept on aspirin on which he will be discharged.
