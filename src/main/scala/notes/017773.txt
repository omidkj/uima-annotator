History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5730**] is a 22 yo F with a history of asthma who presents
with worsening shortness of breath, cough, and R-sided pleuritic
chest pain since awakening early this morning.  She reports that
she has had URI symptoms of rhinorrhea, sore throat, and cough
for the past couple of days, which dramatically worsened this
morning.  Her cough is productive of yellow/tan sputum, denies
bloody sputum.  She also reports that she in unable to take a
deep breath because "[my lungs] just won't let me".  She reports
that she has been taking her Advair daily and has also been
using her rescue inhaler regularly for the past couple of days.
The pt denies any history of blood clots or recent air travel,
prolonged car travel, trauma to the LEs, or swelling in the
legs, but does report that she has been taking OCPs for the past
couple of months.  Pt denies myalgias, arthralgias, and
nausea/vomiting.

In the ED, VS: T 98.8, HR 98, BP 148/77, RR 16, O2sat 100%RA.
Physical exam without wheezing, no accessory muscle use.  Pt
given prednisone 60 mg, as well as combivent & albuterol nebs,
for presumed asthma exacerbation, and ibuprofen for R-sided
chest pain.  However, CXR was indicative of RLL pneumonia for
which pt was started on 750 mg of levofloxacin.  Pt developed
fever to 102.2 following nebs, and also developed worsening
tachypnea to 24, with O2 sat 95% on RA (99% on 2L NC).  Pt was
admitted due to worsening respiratory condition.

Currently, pt is with considerable shortness of breath as well
as persistent right-sided chest pain.  She reports that her
dyspnea is worse than when she presented to the ED this morning.

Chest x-ray ([**3-31**]): Right lower lobe pneumonia.
ECG ([**4-1**]): Sinus tachycardia. ST-T wave abnormalities. RSR'
pattern in lead V1. Clinical correlation is suggested. No
previous tracing available for comparison.
Chest x-ray ([**4-1**]) #1: Increasing pneumonia and pleural effusion
at the right base.
Chest x-ray ([**4-1**]) #2: There is interval increase in right
pleural effusion and ajacent lung consolidation. There is also
increase in left pleural effusion with left retrocardiac
consolidation.
Chest x-ray ([**4-2**]): No short-term interval change was
demonstrated in the bibasilar right significantly more than left
consolidations and bilateral pleural effusions also right more
than left.
Chest x-ray ([**4-3**]): No significant interval change of the
bibasilar opacities, right greater than left.
Chest CT [**4-7**] - Severe multifocal pneumonia, with complete
heterogenous consolidation of the right middle lobe and right
lower lobe, associated with necrotizing component in right lower
lobe. Obstruction of the bronchus intermedius with peribronchial
nodal tissue could be due to mucous plugging and less likely
inflammatory reaction to a foreign body.
Chest CT [**4-14**] -Overall improvement. Improvement in right lower
lobe collapse and
consolidation, left lower lobe consolidation and collapse, and
aeration of
multiple bronchi as described above. Improvement of bilateral
pleural
effusion, especially on the right.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 5730**] is a 22 yo F with a hx of asthma found to have severe
community-acquired pneumonia, transferred to MICU on HD#1 with
increasing dyspnea and O2 requirement, with slow improvement on
empiric vancomycin/levofloxacin; transferred to medicine floor
on HD#3.

1) Severe community-acquired pneumonia: Pt was initiated on
levofloxacin for CAP, but continued to progress during hospital
day #1 with worsening tachypnea, new O2 requirement, and
splinting due to severe right-sided pleuritic chest pain.  She
was transferred to the MICU where she required high-flow O2 and
vancomycin was empirically added to her antibiotic regimen to
cover a post-viral pneumonia.  Initial ABGs in the MICU
demonstrated respiratory alkalosis, but lactate was elevated as
well indicating a superimposed metabolic acidosis in the setting
of sepsis.  Sputum samples with no definitive microbiology, but
rather moderate oropharyngeal flora, for which broad-spectrum
antibiotics were continued.  Respiratory viral panel as well as
urine legionalla were negative, and BCx were with no growth to
date.  Serial chest x-rays demonstrated rapid progression of
right lower lobe consolidation from HD #1- HD #2, but no
interval change following that time period.  U/S in the MICU was
negative for a loculated or drainable pleural effusion.  Pt
slowly improved clinically on an
