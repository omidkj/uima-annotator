Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient was med flighted to [**Hospital1 346**] for cardiac catheterization.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 88 year-old
female with a history of coronary artery disease status post
inferior myocardial infarction in [**2125**], history of
hypertension and history of hypercholesterolemia who
presented to [**Hospital3 1280**] with complaint of shortness of breath
and substernal chest pain that had lasted for two days.  She
presented on [**2133-10-22**].  She describes this as a burning
sensation such as "breathing in cold air."  There were no
associated symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis or
palpitations.  The pain was worse while lying down.  She had
no history of angina.  There is a question of myocardial
infarction versus myopericarditis at [**Hospital3 1280**].  Her CK was
found to be 92, which elevated to 137 then 142 with troponin
elevations from 1.84 to 3.7 to 4.02.  Cardiac catheterization
at the outside hospital showed three vessel disease with 90%
occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and
total occlusion of the right coronary artery.  At this time
the patient was med flighted to [**Hospital1 188**] and no further intervention was performed.  The
patient had a cardiac catheterization in [**2128-3-16**], which
showed diffuse 50% obtuse marginal one stenosis at the
stented site.  The area was patent by angiography and IVUF.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease status post
inferior myocardial infarction, also with percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent of the obtuse
marginal one.  The patient had a myocardial infarction in
11/96 and she was found to have a residual EF of 60%.  She
had question of congestive heart failure in the past and
history of hypertension, history of hypothyroidism, history
of hypercholesterolemia and diabetes.  The patient also had a
history of osteoarthritis status post left knee replacement.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Lopressor 50 mg po b.i.d., aspirin
325 mg po q.d., Lipitor 10 mg po q day, Levoxyl 150 mcg po
q.d., Protonix 40 mg po q day, Colace prn and she was also on
an intravenous nitroglycerin drip and intravenous heparin
drip.

ALLERGIES:  Codeine.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's sister died at 69 of a
myocardial infarction.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient had quit smoking thirty five
years ago, but use to smoke one pack a day for approximately
twenty four years.  She had no history of alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs 95.0, 91, and
blood pressure of 88/51 with an intraaortic balloon pump in
place.  General appearance, tired ill appearing female
without much movement and in no acute distress.  HEENT pupils
are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Dry mucous membranes.  No scleral icterus.  Neck no JVD.  No
carotid bruits.  Cardiac regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs
appreciated.  Distant heart sounds.  Pulmonary distant breath
sounds.  Patient with very little air movement.  Abdomen
positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities no clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Very faint
dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulses.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 12.6,
hematocrit 30.4 and platelets 396.  Coagulation studies
showed an INR of 1.6 and PTT of 81.3.  Electrolytes showed
sodium 137, potassium 4.4, chloride 103, bicarbonate 22, BUN
45 and creatinine 1.9 with a glucose of 197.  Cardiac enzymes
drawn in the Coronary Care Unit showed a CK of 319, MB of 32
and troponin greater then 50.  Electrocardiogram showed
question of idioventricular rhythm, ST depressions in AVL,
retrograde T waves and left bundaloid morphology.  Cardiac
catheterization showed elevated wedge pressure of 37 and
otherwise findings of markedly increased filling pressures,
left main with 30% diffuse disease.  Left anterior descending
coronary artery with 90% proximal occlusion with TIMI two
flow after the balloon was inserted, 3.8 by 8 mm hepacoach
sent, ramus to intermedius had the ability to rescue it.
Renal function has minimization of contrast used.  The
patient has a diagnosis of cardiogenic shock with a PA
saturation of 42%.  Therefore an intraaortic balloon pump was
placed.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 15937**]ssment and recommendations from the cardiac
catheterization included anterior myocardial infarction with
cardiogenic shock, aspirin and Plavix for thirty days at
least, ace inhibitor when the creatinine stabilized, heparin
half dose while on Integrilin for 24 hours and an intraaortic
balloon pump.  Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] of Cardiothoracic Surgery was
also consulted.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Given the above the patient was diagnosed
with a large anterior myocardial infarction and cardiogenic
shock.

1.  Cardiac:  Pump, the patient was continued on an
intravenous nitroglycerin drip.  She was continued on a lower
dose of Metoprolol, which subsequently was discontinued.  She
was maintained on an intraaortic balloon pump for a day.  She
was prepared for a coronary artery bypass graft, however,
this was not performed.  Subsequently she was diuresed with
Lasix for presumed congestive heart failure.  She was started
on ianatrops for one day, however, this was discontinued
secondary to abnormal and occasional supraventricular
tachycardias on telemetry.  For ischemia she was continued on
Plavix, aspirin and her heparin drip.  The Integrilin drip
was discontinued one day after catheterization.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient had periods of apnea on her
monitor prior to the catheterization.  Subsequently she was
sating about 95% on room air.

3.  Endocrine:  The patient had a question of diabetes
mellitus and a history of hypothyroidism.  Therefore she was
maintained on an regular insulin sliding scale and continued
on her Synthroid.  The patient was also continued on Protonix
and her heparin drip.  Given the above the patient had some
difficulty being weaned off the intraaortic balloon pump,
however, this was achieved after days.  The patient's
Captopril dose was increased upwards.  She was started on
Hydralazine and that was titrated upwards.  She was also put
on Isordil and that was titrated upwards.

However, the patient continued to experience significant
congestive heart failure and it was the families decision
given the severity of her congestive heart failure and her
frequent episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and apnea
that she be made comfort measures only.  Therefore the
patient was maintained on morphine.  She was given multiple
medications for her major complaint, which was cough and this
very pleasant female died probably of supraventricular
tachycardia on [**2133-10-29**] at 11:20 a.m.
