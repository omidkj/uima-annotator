Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1145**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Reason for transfer: Atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy.



Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardioversion [**2120-12-27**], [**2120-12-22**], [**2120-12-19**]

History of Present Illness:
This is a 44 year old gentleman with no known medical history
who presented on Monday to an OSH with onset of dyspnea. The
patient reports that he had a symptoms of a cold characterized
by congestion and cough for approximately a week and a half. He
saw his PCP one week ago and was prescribed a course of oral
steroids. His symptoms improved over the next few days. Last
Saturday, [**12-14**] (3 days ago), the patient reported sudden onset
of dyspnea. Simple tasks such as getting up from the chair or
climbing up stairs resulted in him becoming short of breath. He
notes no chest pain or palpitations. For the past week he has
noticed waking up from sleep suddenly and requires 3 pillows to
lie down comfortably. No wheezing, no recent fevers.
.
He went to the OSH as his dyspnea had persisted for three days.
There, he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with RVR, HR
from 140-165. BP 148/88, RR 26 O2 96 on 2L. The patient was
admitted to the ICU unit and started on a diltiazem drip.
Heparin gtt was also started. The patient underwent an [**Month/Year (2) 113**]
which revealed severe, unexplained cardiomyopathy with an EF of
20-25% and 4+MR. The patient was started on lisinopril and
underwent diuresis with 20 IV lasix, fluid balance -1350 over
the hospital stay with improvement in dyspnea.
.
Pt also admitted to drinking 6 beers the day prior to admission,
denied history of alcohol abuse. He was placed on a CIWA scale.

.
Rate control remained difficult despite diltiazem drip at 15
mg/hr and initiation of metoprolol. SBP remained stable as did
respiratory function. He was transferred here for further
management.
.


Past Medical History:
1) Status post cholecystectomy
2) Status post tonsillectomy


Social History:
Works in packaging. Married with two children. Drink -2 beers on
occasion, denies that he drinks frequently. Did drink six beers
while watching football game 2 d PTA. No tobacco or illicit drug
use.

Family History:

history of CHF, arrhythmias or sudden death. Mother alive and
well. Medical history of father unknown.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 44 year old gentleman with no significant past medical
history was admitted to an OSH for dyspnea where he was found to
be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and to
have severe cardiomyopathy with an EF of 25% of unclear cause.
He was transferred for further management of his AF with RVR
which was proving to be refractory to standard treatments.  On
admission, his rates remained in the 120 to 140 range despite
aggressive attempts at rate control with diltiazem and
metoprolol.  His blood pressure were in the low normal
(85-95)range through this time.  Heparin was maintained for
anticoagulation.
.
Also of note, the patient had some signs of volume overload
(JVD, pulm congestion).  He was not in respiratory distress and
received a one time dose of lasix to which he had a good
diuresis response.  He remained essentially euvolemic
thereafter.  Lisinopril was maintained.
.
Given the lack of success in rate control of the AF with RVR, it
was decided to attempt cardioversion on HD 3.  A TEE performed
before the cardioversion showed no evidence of intracardiac
thrombus, it also confirmed the low EF.  Cardioversion that day
was not successful.  On the advice of the Electrophysiology
Service, amiodarone was added to his regimen of metoprolol and
diltiazem.  His rates were somewhat improved but still remained
above 100.  The amiodarone dose was therefore increased on HD 4.
