Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY: 64 y/o M with history of alcoholic cirrhosis presenting
with gastroccult positive emesis, hematochezia, concerning for
GI bleeding.
.
# GI bleeding/abdominal pain: He has a history of alcoholic
cirrhosis, with Grade 1 varices on EGD [**10-30**]. Initial concern
was for bleeding varices with emergent endoscopy performed at
bedside by hepatology. No varices were noted, with gastropathy
observed likely an alcoholic gastropathy, accounting for his
abdominal pain. He was started on a proton pump inhibitor, and
transitioned from ceftriaxone given in the ED to ciprofloxacin
for 5 day course for SBP prophylaxis. He was advanced to a
regular diet and serial HCT were stable. Prilosec 40mg [**Hospital1 **] was
recommended, as was avoidance of chocolate, peppermint, alcohol,
caffeine, onions, aspirin and elevation of the head of the bed 3
inches, going to bed on empty stomach. At the time of discharge,
his Hct was stable at 42.2.
.
# Anion gap acidosis: He had an initial anion gap of 24 on lab
evaluation with serum osms 366. The osm gap was accounted for by
ETOH level of 246 and mild ketonuria was also observed
suggesting some starvation ketoacidosis. He received 3L of IVF
and 1L from a banana bag with improvement in gap to 18. On
discharge from ICU and the hospital, his gap was closed.
.
# ETOH cirrhosis and ETOH abuse: He has presumed ETOH cirrhosis
(no biopsy), with well compensated portal hypertension on last
eval with hepatologist Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] in [**2160-4-20**] and grade I varices
on EGD [**10-30**] although none observed on EGD today.Synthetic
function is preserved. Recently started drinking again following
several months abstinence. He was placed on a CIWA scale with
positive [**Doctor Last Name **] with valium given as needed. He complained on
bilateral shooting foot pain with sensation intact. A vitamin B
level in [**8-30**] WAS 1561, on recheck this admission this was 1159.
He received IV thiamine, folate and a multivitamin to protect
from wernickes encephalopathy. His gabapentin and fluoxetin were
initially held but were restarted. He was discharged on PO
thiamine, folate, and multivitamin.
.
# Elevated LFTs: He had a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, of
interest, AST/ALT ratio is not c/w with alcohol alone. Pt with
prior +ve HepC antibody with subsequent indeterminant RIBA, but
negative HCV viral load indicating exposure with viral
clearance. Prior [**Last Name (un) **] positive, HepB surface antigen positive
(hepB immune). Prior anit-smooth anitbody positive but non
specific. No fam history or prior eval for hemochromatosis
although patient noted to have some hyperpigmentation. LFTS were
trended inhouse and improved. Hep serologies and workup for
hemochromatosis can be considered for the outpatient setting.
.
# Hypoxia: Initially requiring 4L NC with prior evidence
emphysema on CT, currently smoking, with unremarkable CXR on
admission. He was weaned off 02 as he became less intoxicated
and continued his home proair. A nicotine patch was given and
smoking cessation is encouraged.
.
# Chest pain: endorses several months of intermittent mid
epigastric chest pain, non exertional, unclear if related to
food,
