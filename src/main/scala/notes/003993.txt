Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19205**] was admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 14680**] service in Interventional
Pulmonology at the [**Hospital1 69**] on
[**2194-10-24**] for further evaluation of a cavitated density in the
superior segment of the LLL with narrowing of the airway.  On
[**2194-10-26**], he underwent a diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis
for a large left pleural effusion for which cytology was
negative for malignant cells.  The next day, he underwent a
flexible bronchoscopy to assess for airway patency.  During the
procedure, moderate tracheomalacia, moderate to severe left
bronchomalacia, and a right main stem endobronchial lesion was
found.  For details of each procedure, please see dictations.
For his airway compromise, he was started on a prednisone taper
at 60mg for two days to decrease by 10mg every two days until he
reaches 5mg. (At discharge, [**2194-11-3**], he took the second/last
dose of 30mg).

Mr. [**Known lastname 19205**] course was complicated by atrial fibrillation the
night of his admission (HR as high as 160s bpm) which
forestalled his bronchoscopy.  A cardiology consult was
obtained.  the decision by the consulting team was for rate
control given his history of ablation for atrial flutter.  Also,
given his history of hemoptysis and current disease, no
anticoagulation and only aspirin was deemed appropriate
currently.

Mr. [**Known lastname 19205**] was deemed appropriate to be discharged to a rehab
facility on [**2194-10-31**].  He is to continue his course of
prophylactic Unasyn for presumed pneumonia.  Lastly, he is to
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 3 weeks by calling his office for an
appointment.  As his WBC was elevated during his stay and at
discharge, a CBC with differential is to be drawn on [**2194-11-3**]
and the result paged to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (Fellow-Interventional
Pulmonology): [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9986**], pager [**Numeric Identifier 34656**].
