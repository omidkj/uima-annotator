Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
fever and increasing secretions

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
66 year old female with tracheal stenosis s/p trach/PEG
presenting with hypoxia and increased sputum production and
transferred to the MICU for significant nursing requirements.
Her baseline O2 sats are in the low 90s and tends to desaturate
with mucus plugging or agitation. Also, she has only mild
secretions at baseline. On the morning of admission she had an
oxygen saturation in the 60s and was cyanotic. She was seen at
an OSH ED where she was bagged & suctioned and clinically
improved immediately. She remained hemodynamically stable with
BP 90s/40s and asymptomatic. She had an abnormal but stable CXR
and BNP was 251. Her temperature was 100.6 and WBC count was 13K
with 10% bands. She was started on ertapenem and vancomycin for
healthcare associated pneumonia then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], she continued to have profuse tracheal secretions. She
ultimately required suctioning every hour leading to
desataturations to the 60s with suctioning. Her secretions are
described as deep tan, thick and intermittently frothy. Her ABG
was: 7.47/38/53 on 70% trach collar and she was placed on 100%
trach collar. CXR demonstated an LLL infiltrate (preliminary).
She required intense nursing and respiratory therapy attention
and was then transferred to the MICU for further care and
monitoring.


Past Medical History:
-Coronary artery disease s/p CABG in [**2118**] and "recent" PCI

postoperative course with post-operative atrial fibrillation
wtih RVR requiring cardioversion, sepsis, Pseudomonas VAP, VRE
UT, and prolonged intubation leading to trach/PEG. Discharged to
chronic wean facility but unable to decannulate. Bronchoscopy
revealed tracheomalacia of subglottic region.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 66 year old woman with history of respiratory
failure & tracheostomy following hip replacement surgery,
diastolic CHF, CAD, admitted for respiratory distress and
hypoxia, transferred to the MICU for management of her copious
secretions.
.
# Respiratory failure: Pt has chronic hypoxia with a 40 to 50%
trach collar requirement to keep sats in low 90s.  Pt had acute
worsening hypoxia due to healthcare associated pneumonia (and
associated copious sputum production).  Pt initially treated
with zosyn/vanc until cultures came back positive for
Pseudomonas.  The pseudomonal sensitivities are as follows:
CEFEPIME (sensitive), CEFTAZIDIME (sensitive), CIPROFLOXACIN
(sensitive), GENTAMICIN (sensitive), IMIPENEM (resistant),
MEROPENEM (sensitive), PIPERACILLIN/TAZO (sensitive), TOBRAMYCIN
(sensitive).  She was treated with meropenem & ciprofloxacin for
double coverage.  She is to complete total of 14 days of
antibiotcs (start day = [**2137-7-7**], stop day [**2137-7-20**]).
She was also treated with atrovent and albuterol nebs as she had
occasional of episodes wheezing.  The pt underwent bronchoscopy
on [**2137-7-7**] which showed some thick secretions.  Her mucosa was
normal and no lesions were seen.
During her hospital stay, pt required mechanical ventilation via
trach as she became developed more severe hypoxia.  She
underwent CTA chest, which was negative for PE, but did show
evidence of pulmonary edema.  Her BNP was elevated at ~1300.
These findings along with her fluid balance of positive 4L for
her length of stay suggested that she was likely volume
overloaded.  Pt was diuresed w/ IV lasix.  She may need further
diuresis once at rehab; dosing of lasix should be done at the
discretion of the rehab physician.
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] discharge, the pt required frequent suctioning for her thick
tracheal secretions.  She was tolerating periods of trach mask
(up to six hours on the day before discharge) followed by time
on the vent.  It is believed that as pt recovers from her
pneumonia and pulmonary edema resolves she should again tolerate
full time trach mask.  Until then, may need the vent for short
periods of time.
.
# Airway stenosis: Patient found to have severe supraglottic
edema from likely GERD as well as subglottic
stenosis/?tracheomalacia.  She has been followed by Dr.
[**Name (NI) **], who recently referred the pt to otolaryngologist
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (# [**Telephone/Fax (1) 31733**]).  The pt was seen by ENT during her
stay.  The recommended optimizing her PPI therapy given evidence
of severe GERD.  Her PPI was changed to twice daily dosing.
They also recommended follow-up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] (scheduled for
[**2137-7-19**] at 1pm).  In the future, she will likely need rigid
bronchoscopy.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: not currently on rate controlling
medications as her rate is well controlled w/o meds (70-80 bpm).
 Not on anticoagulation (reason unclear).  Pt was in sinus for
the duration of her hospital stay.
.
# Depression/Anxiety: Pt needs frequent re-assurance regarding
her care and clinical status.  She was treated with prn
lorazepam, which she required frequently, and standing klonopin.

.
# Acute Renal Failure: baseline creatinine of 0.7 to 1.0.  Was
1.7 on admission.  Due to pre-renal etiology.  It improved with
IVF. Discharge crt 0.7.
.
# Anemia: likely anemia of chronic disease given significant
medical issues over the last few months. Iron studies done last
month revealed elevat
