CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT

Reason: check PICC placement

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
72 year old man with AAA s/p thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair
now s/p percutaneous tracheostomy placement
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
check PICC placement
HISTORY: AAA repair. Assess line placement.

AP BEDSIDE CHEST. Bilateral effusions layering in semierect
position. There is considerable associated left lower lobe
atelectasis and possible consolidation. Lungs remain well
inflated, suggesting possible emphysema. Tip of left central
line just reaches the mid SVC. Satisfactorily positioned NG tube
below diaphragm and ET tube. Lower thoracic and upper lumbar
midline skin staples and large unusual a wire suture material
overlying left upper abdomen. Multiple tiny skin staples
overlying the mediastinum up to the level of the aortic arch
with no sternal wires sutures. No overt vascular congestion or
consolidations in the visualized mid and upper lungs. Little
change from similar exam one day previous. Heart normal size
with a poorly assessed dilated thoracic aorta.

IMPRESSION: No short interval change in bilateral effusions and
probable emphysema.

Brief Hospital Course:
This 72WM was admitted on [**2190-8-20**] with 3 days of increaseing
abdominal pain.  CTA revealed an 8.5 cm thorocoabdominal
aneurysm.  He had an hypotensive episode shortly after admission
and was taken emergently to the OR.  He had repalcement of the
descending thoracic aorta and abdominal aorta with
reimplantation of the visceral arteries.  He tolerated the
procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU on Labetolol and
Propofol.  The following morning he had a pulseless L foot and
had a femoral-femoral bypass grafting done.  His foot improved
and he was in stable condition.  He was unable to move his lower
extremities following his initial surgery, and had no sensation.
 He was evaluated by neurology who felt he had a spinal cord
infarct with a poor prognosis for recovery.
He was unable to wean from the vent and required occasional
bronchoscopy for secretions.  He had intermittent bouts of
atrial fibrillation and was treated with Amiodorone.  on [**9-1**] he
had R arm swelling and had a DVT of the cephalic vein.  He was
heparinized at that time.  [**9-6**] he underwent tracheostomy.  He
continued to progress and was having trach mask trials and short
periods of using the Passe-Muir valve.  He was doing well until
he began desaturating during the week of [**2190-9-17**].  He was
eventually very hard to ventilate and had a bronchsocopy which
revealed granulomatous tissue growth which was blocking the
trach.  This was debrided and very friable.  Later that day he
had an arrest when and was difficult to ventilate.  He had clots
removed and improved.  [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 295**] trach was placed and patient
tolerated it well. He had 2 bronchs since that tiem, for
secretions, and grew out MSSA on [**9-24**].  Since that time he has
progressed and he had an open G tube placed on [**9-24**]. He has
undergone routine bronchoscopies X 2.  He was discharged to
acute rehab for vent wean and spinal cord rehab.  He should
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] & [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] upon discharge from
rehab or in 1 month.
