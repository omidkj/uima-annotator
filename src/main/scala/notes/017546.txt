History of Present Illness:
35 yo M with cerebral palsy who initially presented [**2115-2-13**] with
abdominal pain and distention to an OSH.  CT scan was performed
and was reported as diffuse bowel edema, gastric varices,
ascites and a pancreatic cyst.  He reportedly had no associated
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematemesis, hematochezia, jaundice,
fevers or dysuria.  Also reported no recent weight loss, no
NSAIDs or ASA use. In ED, his initial vitals temp 98.0 HR 100 BP
83/59 RR 20. He then received Unasyn at the OSH.   Foley placed,
recieved IVF and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Patient was
non-verbal, in distress.

Per family, patient had multiple admissions prior for
constipation, with a recent drainage of a pancreatic cyst this
past year in [**Hospital3 **]. He has a bowel movement everyday
except on the day of presentation to the OSH. He tolerated PO
and was at his baseline the night of his presentation. His
abdomen was distended and painful to palpation according to his
mother, which is why she brought her son to the OSH.

Upon transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2-13**] and admitted to the SICU team
given concern for an acute surgical abdomen. Diagnostic
paracentesis ([**2-13**]) with WBC [**Numeric Identifier **] (no growth so thought to be
[**1-15**] inflammatory state), Lipase 216, Amylase 141.  He was
started on Vanco/Zosyn/Flagyl for suspected peritonitis and
ischemic bowel with translocation. He was then intubated [**2115-2-14**]
(in the ED) for respiratory failure.  A left subclavian line was
placed on [**2-14**].  He was then given Phenytoin but this was
transitioned to Keppra the same day.  On [**2-15**] Vitamin K 1mg was
infused.   TPN started [**2115-2-15**].  He was continued on maintenance
IVF with intermittent bolus but on [**2-16**] was given Lasix.  On [**2-16**]
he was started on Heparin gtt for SMV thrombus.  Did have
diarrhea, but improving over the course of admission. [**2115-2-16**]
with 3L therapeutic / diagnostic paracentesis (negative culture
to date, WBC 1390).  Concerning his respiratory status, he was
extubated [**2-17**] (s/p 4 days of mechanical ventilation) and
re-intubated [**2-18**] given increased secretions and concern that he
was unable to protect his airway.  On [**2-18**] Warfarin was started
and Flagyl was discontinued.  On [**2-19**] Tobramycin was added for
suspected untreated infection given lower blood pressures.  Upon
transfer there is no positive culture data.  Patient has been
febrile > 100.5 on [**2-10**] and [**2-19**] but without leukocytosis.
Also with persisent tachycardia > 100 bpm except for [**2-16**] and
[**2-20**].  CTA Abdomen / pelvis with SMV thrombus, Vascular surgery
consulted and thought it was likely a chronic issue given degree
of collaterals and probably due to chronic pancreatic
inflammation with associated vascular congestion and slowing.

Given no acute surgical issues, patient was transferred to the
Medical ICU team on [**2115-2-20**].  Upon initial evaluation, family at
bedside confirms that he felt unwell for about one week prior to
admission.  He is nonverbal at baseline, but will push your hand
away if you push his abdomen and he's in pain.  Otherwise, no
localizing symptoms.

DISCHARGE LABS:

-----------------
STUDIES:
[**2115-2-13**] CXR: 1. Low lung volumes. No focal consolidation. 2.
Small bowel wall thickening and dilation, better evaluated on
the outside hospital CT.
.
[**2115-2-15**] KUB: IMPRESSION: No evidence of free air. There is a
relative paucity of bowel gas on this study; distended loops of
fluid-containing small bowel cannot be excluded.
.
[**2115-2-16**] CTAP: IMPRESSION: 1. Diffusely abnormal gastrointestinal
tract with mucosal hyperenhancement and wall thickening. Given
the finding of SMV occlusion, findings are highly concerning for
venous congestion/ischemia. An element of shock bowel could also
be a possibility. 2. Hyperenhancement of the adrenal glands and
narrowed distal aorta, iliac and femoral vessels, suggesting
hypovolemia/shock. Correlate clinically. 3. Sequelae of chronic
pancreatitis with a rim-enhancing fluid collection in the region
of the pancreatic head, likely representing pseudocyst. This may
be the etiology of SMV thrombosis. 4. Diffusely abnormal hepatic
parenchyma, consistent with the history of hepatitis. Partially
occlusive right portal vein thrombus. 5. Small bilateral pleural
effusions, increased from the prior exam. Ground- glass and
nodular opacities at the lung bases suggesting infection.
.
[**2115-2-19**] TTE:  Technically limited study; Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. At least mild to moderate
aortic stenosis is present (but cannot be fully quantified). No
aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

.
[**2115-2-26**] Renal US 1. Small size and echogenic appearance of the
kidneys consistent with chronic, diffuse parenchymal disease. No
hydronephrosis. 2. Ascites.
.
[**2115-3-6**] Abdomen US IMPRESSION: Small ascites. Again noted
probable pseudocyst in the midline and collateral vessels
related to the SMV thrombosis.
.
[**2115-3-7**]: KUB Multiple dilated loops of large and small bowel,
more prominent is colonic dilation. Findings are concerning for
large bowel obstruction.
.
[**2115-3-9**]: KUB Interval increase in gaseous distension of a
segment of colon in the lower abdomen. Appearance is
nonspecific, but distal colonic obstruction cannot be excluded
and further evaluation by CT should be considered.
.
[**2115-3-10**]: KUB There has been apparent placement of a rectal tube
(recommend clinical correlation with recent procedural history).
There has been decrease in deg
