right
transverse loop colostomy ([**2157-5-16**])

DIAGNOSIS:







1.     Colon; extended left hemicolectomy (A-N):

Diverticulosis with fibrosis, chronic inflammation and focal
foreign body reaction (see comment).
Skin / colonic mucosa with reactive changes, consistent with
ostomy site.
Four lymph nodes with reactive changes (0/4).
Comment. The histologic appearances are consistent with previous
diverticula rupture



2.     Small bowel, mid; segmental excision (O-AH):

Focal transmural defect lined by small intestinal-type
epithelium with associated fibrosis, acute and chronic
inflammation with abscess formation and foreign body reaction to
fecal material (see comment).
Margins of resection with focal acute serositis.
Two lymph nodes with reactive changes (0/2).
Comment. The small bowel pathology is most likely related to the
patient's complicated diverticular disease with abscess
formation and abscess drainage. No granulomas are seen. Sections
of bowel away from the involved areas show no significant
mucosal disease. Slides O-AA and AF-AH were reviewed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 174**].



Clinical: Diverticulitis.
Gross:

The specimens are received fresh as two parts, both labeled with
the patient's name "[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **]" and her medical record
number.

Part 1 is additionally labeled "left colon." It consists of a
segment of colon measuring 80.0 cm in length and up to 5.0 cm in
diameter.  A piece of mesentery is attached to the colon that
measures 80.0 x 3.0 x 2.0 cm.  The specimen has an attached
ellipse of skin with sutures that measures 4.4. x 1.3 cm, at one
end. The other end has a 5.0 cm staple line. The mesenteric and
pericolic fat show a few areas of hemorrhage and induration.
The serosa of the bowel has a few areas of erythema, but is
otherwise grossly unremarkable. The specimen is opened along the
antimesenteric border. The  bowel lumen contains hard fecal
material and there are numerous diverticula. No other mucosal
lesions are identified. There is a single area of mucosal /
submucosal thickening, measuring 2.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm, that
extends to within 10 cm of the 5 cm stapled line. The specimen
is sectioned to show several diverticula.  No discrete lesions
are identified on sectioning the area of thickening. The
mesenteric and pericolic fat is dissected for lymph nodes. Two
other unoriented segments of bowel are received in addition.
These measure 10 cm in length x 4 cm in diameter (larger
specimen ) and 6.5 cm in length x 5.5 cm (smaller specimen).
There are occasional diverticula. The attached mesenteric fat
measures 5.5 x 4.5 x 2.5 cm on each of the two bowel segments
and appear grossly unremarkable.  The specimen is represented in
cassettes as follows: A =  5 cm stapled margin line end; B =
ostomy site (skin and attached mucosa); C-E = sections of
diverticula; F = section of thickened area 10 cm from 5 cm
stapled margin line; G = sections of unremarkable appearing
mucosa; H = section of mesenteric fat adjacent to thickened
mucosal area with possible lymph node; I-J = sections of
pericolic fat with possible lymph nodes; K = sections from
larger additional segment of colon (margins); L = section from
larger additional segment of colon with possible diverticulum; M
= sections from smaller additional segment of colon (margins); N
= sections from smaller segment of colon (area of hemorrhage and
bowel).
Part 2 is additionally labeled "segment of mid small bowel." It
consists of a segment of small bowel that measures 30 cm in
length and up to 4 cm in diameter.  The mesentery attached to
the small bowel measures 30 x 4.5 x 2.0 cm. The specimen is not
oriented and has stapled ends measuring 2.1 cm and 2.2 cm. The
mesentery has two firm areas adjacent to the bowel, but is
otherwise unremarkable. The specimen is opened along the
antimesenteric border. The lumen contains yellow fecal material.
The mucosal surface is largely unremarkable. However, there are
two firm areas, measuring 2.5 x 1.4 x 0.4 cm and 2.2 x 1.2 x 0.4
cm, located on opposite ends of the segment of small bowel.  The
surgeon has indicated one of the firm areas with a single
suture. This area extends to within 1.1 cm of the stapled margin
line that measures 2.1 cm.  The other firm area on the opposite
end of the bowel extends to within 2.8 cm of the 2.2 cm stapled
line.  The remainder of the mesentery is unremarkable on
sectioning.  The specimen is represented as follows: O = margin
from 2.1 cm stapled end; P = margin from 2.2 cm stapled end; Q-T
= sections of entirely submitted firm area (from side with
suture); U = sections of unremarkable small bowel mucosa; V-AA
= sections of entirely submitted 2nd submucosal firm area (from
the opposite non-sutured end); AB,AC = entirely submitted
mesenteric fat with lymph node adjacent to sutured submucosal
firm area; AD, AE = second entirely submitted lymph node found
upon dissecting mesentery; AF-AH = additional sections of small
bowel..

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient had an extended left hemicolectomy and resection of
