Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 826**]
Chief Complaint:
Called ambulance for weakness, diarrhea; brought to [**Hospital1 18**] for
bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right internal jugular venous catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 52 year old man with multiple medical problems,
including type I diabetes, s/p renal transplant, CAD, and PVD,
who called [**Company 191**] today. He tells me that he was feeling very weak
and had two bowel movements today, loose, and the typical dark
color which he associates with his iron supplementation. Per the
[**Company 191**] note he was having diarrhea and fecal incontinence. He
denies this to me. He was urged to come in for evaluation and
called for an ambulance.



When the ambulance arrived, EMS found him to be bradycardic in
the 30s, and unresponsive, and EMS transcutaneously paced him in
the field to the 60s. When he arrived in the emergency
department they got a heart rate in the 60s, RR of 12, and were
evidently unable to obtain a blood pressure. He had O2 sats of
93-95% in the first 15 minutes of being in the ED.

.

In the ED his EKG revealed diffuse ST depression, especially in
v4-6; cardiology was consulted and ultimately did not feel that
the EKG was significantly different than prior EKGs and was
unlikely to represent an ischemic event. He was found to be
hyperkalemic and received insulin, glucose, and calcium. With
concern for infection he received vancomycin;
piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) was also ordered in the ED but
it is not clear whether this was actually given by the notes in
the ED flow sheet. A central line was placed in the RIJ. An
abdominal CT scan (based on elevated LFTs but normal Alk phos by
labs as well as complaint of abdominal pain and diarrhea), and a
head CT scan were performed; the abdominal CT showed no clear
acute abdominal process, though could not use contrast for renal
reasons; it did show some stranding around the distal colon and
some gallbladder wall edema. The head CT was also negative by
initial read although a formal read was not available. A chest
x-ray showed atelectasis vs consolidation, while the bottom
portion of the abdominal CT also showed effusion and atelectasis
as well as an area of possible infectious consolidation.

.

He had a brief period of hypotension in the ED for which he was
put on dopamine; this was turned off before transit to the MICU.




In terms of review of systems he denies chest pain,
palpitations, dyspnea, syncope or pre-syncope; he affirms back
pain which he says has worsened since his power wheelchair broke
and he can no longer sit properly in it. He denies fevers or
sweats; he says he felt cold today; he denies shaking chills.
