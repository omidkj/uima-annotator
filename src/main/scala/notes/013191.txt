Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 465**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
84 yo woman with h/o dementia, orthostatic hypotension, TIA, PAF
(not on coumadin), severe CAD, and other medical problems listed
below. She was at her nursing home last night and had a
wittnessed fall. According to CRNA she 'got up" and "lost her
balance". She did not report any symptoms prior to
falling. Struck her head on the ground and was unresponsive for
about 5 seconds. Nursing notes from the nursing home report SBP
to be 190 and heart rate in 60s. No finger stick seen. Then was
per EMS confused, unable to follow commands, aggitated, but
apparently oriented to time of day and place.
At [**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital was reportedly "alert and confused at
baseline". Received Dilantin 1gm as well as 2mg Morphine for
pain control during laceration repair.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] ED was noted to be responsive only to
sternal
rub, but spontaneously moving purposefully in all 4 extremities.

Has started waking up just slightly since arriving to ED.
Per Nursing home, patient is on Keflex (since [**6-9**] PM) for 7 day

course, treating UTI. Has h/o recurrent UTIs.
Per nursing home, patient has had "twitching" in her legs for
some time now, which they have been suspecting was "restless leg

syndrome". The patient was to be seeing a neurologist soon to
get
this worked up.

Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo woman with h/o dementia, orthostatic hypotension, PAF
(not on coumadin), CHF, and other multiple medical problems as
listed above, who presents as transfer from OSH with presumed
traumatic SAH in multiple locations.
.
# SAH: as above, thought to be due to fall/trauma.  Pt was
evaluated by neuro and neurosurgery. Medical management
recommended. EEG completed without epileptiform wave patterns.
Pt completed a course of sz prophylaxis, 5 days dilantin
switched to Keppra for possibility of improvement of sedation
and 7day course completed; Repeat head CT was done because of
sedation, showed improvement in SAH. Sedation improved 2 days
prior to discharge with increased activity and improved PO
intake. Anticoagulants were held during this hospitalization. Pt
worked with physical therapy and occupation therapy. Infectious
workup for initial MS changes was negative. Swallow evaluations
were done [**2183-6-16**] recommendations were to advance to a diet of
thin liquids and soft consistency solids with 1:1 supervision to
assist with feeding, Pills should be given whole with thin
liquid.
.
# Fall: Her fall per report was from losing her balance, and
there was no report of pre-syncope. However, she does have
history of orthostatic hypotension and the fall could be
secondary to that.  The patient also has h/o PAF, CHF and severe
CAD, so her fall could have been pre-syncope/sycnope secondary
to arrythmia. However, EP evaluated her pacer, which was
functioning well and showed no suspicous events. Pt was
monitored on telemetry without events and maintained on fall
precautions.
.
# Mental status change: on admission, pt's MS reportedly
significantly off baseline and worse than at [**Location (un) **]. The repeat
CT scan here does not show any SDH or intraventricular bleed,
but the SAH itself could be affecting her Mental status.
Subclinical  seizures need to be considered. Additionally, her
recent Dilantin load and Morphine with renal failure could be
contributing to her depressed mental status. The patient's
movement disorder is difficult to classify. Per nursing home,
this is new within the last year. She also appears to have some
significant atrophy, particularly in the feet. Her mental status
improved significantly the last 3 days prior to discharge.
.
# long term care goals- Discussed pt's poor PO intake with
family over the phone; they would like to avoid NGT/PEG and
rather would like to keep pt comfortable. They understood pt's
poor prognosis if she is undernourished.
.
# CAD: s/p CABG, last stented ~1yr ago.  ASA & plavix held b/c
of bleed.  Troponin slightly elevated in setting of dehydration
and acute renal failure, EKG unchanged.  CK not elevated.
.
# acute renal failure- due to dehydration. Improved with IVF
hydration.
.
# DM: treated with ISS
.
# Code: DNR/DNI
