Desensitization to antibiotics, in the ICU.


History of Present Illness:
68 y/o gentleman with COPD, GERD, MDS evolving into AML in [**2116**]
(see oncologic history below), presents with shortness of
breath, fatigue, and fever. Patient states that he was doing
well until two days ago when he developed increased shortness of
breath and noted a fever of 101. This temperature decreased
without intervention to 98.8 at home.  Walking from the car to
the clinic patient noticed increased shortness of breath and
required to be pushed in a wheelchair by his wife. Pt also
noticed left sided pleuritic chest pain. Pain increased with
deep inspiration and was not present with normal breathing. Pain
was not associated with palpitations, diaphoresis, or radiation.

contacts. [**Name (NI) **] unusual foods.
.
Patient denies any recent diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Denies
abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, or blood in stool.
Denies burning with urination or blood in urine. Notes increased
bruising when his platlets are low. Stable back pain associated
with DJD.
.


Past Medical History:
Oncologic history:
Patient initially presented in [**2116**] with easy bruising
and dropping cell counts (pancytopenic) as well as some
SOB/fatigue. BMBx was consistent by report with myelodysplastic
syndrome with presence of a 15-20% immature cells consistent
with blasts; Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] felt the pathology was consistent with
MDS with excess blasts in transformation, suggesting
acceleration of the disease towards acute leukemia.

Pt underwent induction and reinduction with single [**Doctor Last Name 360**]
clofarabine per protocol 07-013, last treated in 09/[**2116**]. Since
that time, he showed signs of dysplasia was dropping cell lines
and bone marrow biopsy done in [**9-/2118**] showed blasts occurring
in small clusters occupying an estimated 20% of the marrow
cellularity. Cytogenetics showed deletion of the long arm of
chromosome 20 and he was treated on [**2118-9-19**] with his first
cycle of decitabine. C2 decitabine started [**2118-11-1**]. He has
previously opted not to undergo allogeneic stem cell transplant
due to quality of life desires.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Right Upper Lobe Pneumonia/Fever: Right upper lobe pneumonia
on CT scan. Patient initially required 2L NC, then weaned to
room air. Patient became afebrile. Micro data (cultures etc.)
did not point to one particular causative organism. Patient
treated empirically for both fungal and bacterial etiologies.
Infectious disease consultants followed the course. Repeat CT
scan of the chest on [**12-2**] showed improvement of disease but not
complete resolution. On the floor, patient afebrile, without
cough or SOB, breathing on room air. Patient's inpatient
antibiotic course was: tigecycline, meropenem, voriconazole.
Patient transitioned to doxycycline and voriconazole for
discharge. Plan, per Infectious Disease team, to continue on
doxy & vori through the next round of chemo and the patient's
cell count nadir, then if symptomatic to re-image, and if
asymptomatic to stop treatment.
.
2. Drug Rash/Allergies: Patient with extensive drug allergy
history. On admission patient had developed a beet red rash over
his entire body to clindamycin and aztreonam, drugs he had
received successfully in the past. Patient was started on
linezolid, doxycycline, and voriconazole. Further patient was
given Solumedrol 60mg IV and Benadryl 25mg. That night he
developed transient redness and shortness of breath/feeling like
throat was closing during linezolid infusion. Linezolid infusion
was stopped and this redness and shortness of breath resolved.
After discussion with both infectious disease and allergy it was
decided to desensitize the patient to linezolid and meropenem.
Patient was continued on prednisone 20mg daily, Diphenhydramine
25mg Q6hrs, and Prevacid 20mg Q12hrs. In the ICU within 15
minutes of linezolid infusion, the patient began to feel his
throat closing, an erythematous rash was noted on chest, and he
became hypertensive and tachycardic. The infusion was stopped
and symptoms resolved. EKG showed T wave flattening, but these
changes resolved af
