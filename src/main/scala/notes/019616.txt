Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Black Stool

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD [**2151-11-25**]
Bronchoscopy [**2151-11-26**]

History of Present Illness:
72yoF with h/o a.fib, CVA on chronic coumadin,s/p renal
transplant and h/o PUD presents with black stools and increasing
weakness and fatigue over past week. She was recently diagnosed
with left lung nodule for which she is undergoing w/u and went
to see her PCP for this yesterday. At her PCP she admitted to
feeling fatigued, having many black stools, and a 10 lb weight
loss and was subsequently sent to the ED. She has been taking
her coumadin as directed. SHe states she had her INR drawn
friday and it was 3.1. The coumadin clinic she saw told her to
return to her regular doses (3mg T, TH, Sat and 4mg M,W,F,SUn)
which she has. She denies any abdominal pain, diarrhea,
dysphagia, nausea or vomiting. She does report SOB; which she
has had since she has the LUL collapse [**2-19**] the lung mass. She
reports feeling at her baseline relative to this SOB.
.
In the ED,Vitals were stable. NG lavage was performed which
showed coffee grounds. Her INR was found to be elevated to 8.
She received 10mg PO vitamin K and 40mg IV protonix.

Pertinent Results:
Pathology: High grade non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma; see note.
The clinical history and positive [**Last Name (un) **] hybridization is
consistent with a post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder.
     Sections (slides A&B) show a dense infiltrate of cells with
marked crush artifact which precludes optimal assessment of
morphology in most areas.  In discernible areas, the cells
infiltrate around bronchial mucus glands.  There are several
areas of necrosis noted.  The infiltrate is comprised of medium
to large sized cells with scant to moderate basophilic
cytoplasm, round to irregular nuclear contours, and fine
chromatin.  Scattered cells with prominent nucleoli are seen.
Numerous mitoses and apoptotic bodies are present.
     By immunohistochemistry, the infiltrate is diffusely
immunoreactive for leukocyte common antigen (LCA/CD45), and
negative for synaptophysin and chromogranin.  The lymphoid
infiltrate is diffusely immunoreactive for pan B-cell marker
CD20, with co-expression of bcl-6 (subset), and CD10 (slide B).
The tumor cells are negative for bcl-2, bcl-1, and TdT.  CD3, 5,
and 43 highlight a minor subset of admixed T lymphocytes.  DRC
shows scattered dendritic cell meshworks.  MIB-1 staining shows
a proliferation index of 95-100%.  [**Last Name (un) **] ([**Doctor Last Name 3271**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] encoded
RNA) hybridization studies were positive within a large subset
of atypical lymphocytes.
     Overall, the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings are
consistent with a high grade B cell lymphoma.  Given the
patient's history of renal transplant ([**2140**]) and
immunosuppressive therapy, this likely represents a
post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (monomorphic
subtype).  The differential diagnosis includes a high grade
diffuse large B cell lymphoma and less likely an atypical
Burkitt lymphoma.  The morphologic features (including a
monomorphic population of medium-sized cells with 3-5 small,
membrane bound nucleoli) of classic Burkitt lymphoma are not
seen.  Paraffin sections will be sent for FISH analysis to look
for c-myc translocation, and the results reported in an
addendum.

CXR's:
CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2151-11-23**] 7:17 PM
FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest. Since prior exam,
there has been interval increase in opacification of the entire
left hemithorax with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm,
consistent with left lung collapse. The heart cannot be
evaluated. Dense calcification in the expected location of the
aortic knob is again noted, as well as bronchial calcifications.
There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The right lung is clear.
Left- sided rib cage deformity is again noted.
IMPRESSION: Interval increase left lung collpase secondary to
known endobronchial lesion, with increased left hemithorax
opacification and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.
CXR [**11-28**];Left lung remains collapsed. Left bronchial stent in
place. ET tube tip is below the lower margin of the clavicles,
no more than 3 cm from the carina, 2 cm below optimal placement
given that the chin is elevated. Subsequent chest radiograph
5:30 a.m. on [**11-29**] shows standard re-positioning. Right
lung is grossly clear. Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach.
Small right pleural effusion may be present, unchanged.
CXR  [**12-1**]: The left hemithorax is completely opacified due to
known lung collapse. The stent in the left main bronchus is in
unchanged position.
Evaluation of the left lung demonstrates unchanged perihilar and
right lower lobe heaviness, which might be attributed to mild
volume overload, accompanied by small pleural effusion. Giving
the complete collapse of the left lung, vascular prominence may
be explained, at least partially, by arrangement of vascular
flow.
CXR [**12-6**]:Moderately increased opacification of previously
minimal right lung base opacity since [**2151-12-4**] may represent
enlarged effusion or pneumonia. 2. No change in complete
opacification of the left hemithorax since [**2151-11-3**].
CXR [**12-8**]: In comparison with the study of [**12-6**], there is
little change. Complete opacification of the left lung is again
seen, as is the left-sided bronchial stent. Opacification at the
right lung base is consistent with pleural fluid and underlying
atelectasis or pneumonia. The various li
