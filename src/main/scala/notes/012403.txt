ADDENDUM:  This is an Addendum to a Discharge Summary
documenting hospital course through [**2159-8-27**].  This
Addendum will cover the hospitalization from [**8-27**]
through [**2159-8-28**].  Please see the previous Discharge
Summary for the full hospital course from [**Month (only) 205**] through [**8-27**].

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM (CONTINUED):  The patient is
a 55-year-old gentleman with a past medical history
significant for severe peripheral vascular disease and
carotid artery stenosis and occlusion in the left carotid
artery who presented to [**Hospital1 69**]
on [**7-9**] for left lower extremity preoperative arteriogram
for ongoing claudication.

While in the Waiting Room for this procedure, the patient
went into alcohol withdrawal syndrome with delirium tremens
and was then taken to the Emergency Department.

The patient was subsequently admitted from the Emergency
Department to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  His
subsequent hospital course is documented per previous
Discharge Summary.

1.  WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME ISSUES:  The patient continued to
spike fevers but continued to have negative blood cultures.
No other fossae of infection was found.  He had an ultrasound
of his left groin site which was negative for any localized
infection.

2.  RESPIRATORY ISSUES:  The patient's respiratory status
remained stable.  He remained on 35% FIO2 via his
tracheostomy site.

3.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient remained stable.  He
remained in a normal sinus rhythm and was continued on
metoprolol and amiodarone for his previous atrial
fibrillation.  His blood pressure was well controlled, and
his ACE inhibitor was decreased to avoid any hypotension.

4.  LEFT BELOW-KNEE AMPUTATION ISSUES:  His left below-knee
amputation site continued to heal well with dressing changes
every other day.  His last dressing change was on [**8-27**].

5.  NEUROLOGIC ISSUES:  Neurology continued to follow the
patient.  He was started on Lipitor, Plavix, and aspirin
given his recent cerebrovascular accident.

Given his acute medical issues, a repeat carotid Doppler
imaging was not done while in the hospital.  The patient was
to receive carotid Doppler studies as an outpatient within
one week and he was then to follow up with Neurology in one
month for further evaluation and possible plans for surgical
treatment of his carotid artery stenosis.

6.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient
continued to be followed by Nutrition.  He had a follow-up
Speech and Swallow study which showed no overt aspiration;
although a modified barium swallow was unable to be obtained
due to the patient not fitting in the scanner.

It was recommended that his diet continued to be advanced.
The patient was started on thin liquids and on ground solids
which he tolerated well.

7.  PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  He was continued on proton pump
inhibitors and Lovenox anticoagulation prophylaxis.

8.  CODE STATUS:  The patient remained a full code throughout
his hospitalization.
