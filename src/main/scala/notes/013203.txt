In brief,49 yo F with Stage IV Non-small cell lung cancer who
presented to the ED [**2183-5-13**] with new onset fevers, worsening
respiratory status, + cough, worsening sputum, and fevers. She
had recently received her dose of Navelbine chemotherapy [**5-9**].

CXR: [**5-13**]
Lung volumes are mildly diminished with asymmetric density over
the right hemidiaphragm. Blunting of the right costophrenic
angle is again identified anteriorly. There is a rounded mass
lesion seen in the mid central right upper lung projecting
between the posterior aspects of the right fifth and sixth ribs.
Mediastinum is unremarkable. The cardiac silhouette is within
normal limits for size. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
IMPRESSION: Mass lesion recently characterized on [**2183-3-20**]
PET CT. There is increased density over the right dome of the
liver which may represent an early focal infiltrate. Pneumonia
must be suspected until proven otherwise given neutropenic
status.
.
CXR: [**5-14**]
Part of lung apices obscured by patient's chin. The previously
noted right lower lobe opacity appears more prominent today
suggesting right lower lobe pneumonia. The right upper lung
spiculated mass is less readily evident. There are no other
focal consolidations. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
normal. There is no pulmonary edema. There is no pleural
effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Right lower lobe pneumonia.
.
CT head: Multiple new hypodensities in the right frontal, right
temporal, and left centrum semiovale concerning for metastases
in this patient with known metastatic lung cancer. An MRI before
and after IV contrast administration is recommended for further
evaluation. These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **]
at the time of this dictation.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Altered Mental Status: The patient was admitted to the ICU for
altered mental status. She was found to have new brain
metastasis with edema. She was started on dexamthasone 4mg
q6hours  with marked improvement of her mental status. She then
began receiving whole brain radiation. She was continued on the
dexamethasone on discharge but at 4mg q8hours to be tapered as
necessary as an outpatient. On the day of discharge, she was
drowsy in the morning and inattentive. Later in the day, she was
more alert, able to perform attention testing but cont to have
subtle cognitive deficits. The patient demonstrated significant
anxiety at the thought of staying. per her outpt fellow, she has
baseline moderate anxiety.She was started on Zyprexa. Given that
she will have 24 hour supervision at home, it was decided that
she was safe for discharge.

# Pneumonia: The patient was admitted for altered mental status.
CXR noted RLL PNA. She was started on on Cefepime and
Vancomycin. These abx were continued while she was neutropenic.
She received neupogen. When she was no longer neutropenic, she
was switched to bactrim and levofloxacin to complete at 10 day
course of abx. She was monitored for 48 hours and remained
without fever or clinical worsening
