cardiomegaly. EKG showed AFib with RVR to 124 with inverted T
wave in the high lateral leads that doesn't appear different
from previous at least a month ago. Pt was given
Albuterol/Ipratropium nebs, 20 mg IV Diltiazem then 10 mg IV

AP UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: Evaluation is limited by head
position and
exclusion of right costophrenic sulcus. Within this limitation,
moderate
cardiomegaly with left atrial enlargement are unchanged. There
is increased
interstitial and airspace opacity with pulmonary vascular
engorgement
compatible with edema. There are small bilateral pleural
effusions.
Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine is noted.

IMPRESSION: Cardiac decompensation and pulmonary edema.
