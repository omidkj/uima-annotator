Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 17865**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, diaphoresis.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
84M with h/o CVA, afib, h/o PE, recurrent aspiration PNA, recent
admission for abdominal distension presenting from [**Hospital 7137**] with an O2 sat of 65%, HTN to 192/130, HR 150s. He was
placed on oxygen and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: 99.8 145/99 164 31 94%RA. He was
in mild respiratory distress, exam with rhonchi/wheezes similar
to prior aspiration. Labs showed WBC 16, subtherapeutic INR of
1.4 -> given enoxaparin. UA dirty, initial CXR not too
impressive with mild pulmonary edema and a possible left lower
lobe process. EKG with Afib and RVR. He was given 2L IVF, but no
HR meds. Also received combivent nebs x2, vancomycin and
pip-tazo. Since arrival to the ED, he had a slow decline in his
O2 sat. With the decline in hsis O2 sat, the patient was put on
BiPap and subsequently vomited and dropped his sats further. For
his vomiting the patient was given one dose of zofran and a
repeat chest x-ray was performed that showed substantial incease
in bilateral opacties and mild pulmonary edema. EKG showed
atrial fibrillation with RVR at a rate in the 150s with similar
morphology to his baseline. For his atrial fibrillation, the
patient was given 5mg IV lopressor x2. His vitals prior to
transfer were: 113/70 130 fib 30s, 98% NRB.
.
Review of systems is unobtainable secondary to baseline aphasia.

CXR:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-16**], there may be
slight decrease in the bilateral pulmonary opacifications,
predominantly involving the mid and lower lung zones. Again, the
possibilities of extensive aspiration versus some elevation of
pulmonary venous pressure must be considered. Single-channel
pacemaker device remains in place and there is continued
dilatation of gas-filled loops of bowel within the abdomen.
.
AXR:
Again seen is marked diffuse colonic dilatation, similar in
appearance as
compared to prior CT from [**2190-9-6**]. There is no evidence
of
pneumoperitoneum or pneumatosis. A gastric tube is again seen. A
cardiac
pacer wire and an IVC filter are unchanged in location.
Degenerative changes are seen in the lumbar spine.
IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of pseudo-colonic obstruction as
compared to
multiple prior examinations.


Brief Hospital Course:
84M with h/o CVA, afib, h/o PE, recurrent aspiration PNA, recent
admission for abdominal distension presenting from [**Hospital 7137**] with an O2 sat of 65%.

#.  Urinary Tract Infection:  Patient was intially treated with
vanc/zosyn.  Unfortunately, there was no urine culture sent
prior to receiving abx.

#.  Respiratory Distress - Pt has history of aspiration as well
as flash pulmonary edema. The patient also had a witnessed
aspiration event in the ED when BiPap was attempted.  Pt is
covered for HAP with vanc/zosyn, switched to cefpodoxime to
complete 8 day course upon discharge.  The Initial CXR showed
some evidence of left lower lobe process.  Patient was also in
afib with RVR and likely flashed from that as well.  BNP was
>[**2181**].  He was diuresed with Lasix.  His BB was uptitrated for
improved rate control.  Must also consider PE given known
history and subtherapeutic INR.

#. Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response:  In the
MICU, he was initially on dilt gtt and transitioned to home
beta-blocker, which was titrated up.  He was initially
subtherapeutic on coumadin, received a dose of lovenox in the
ED.  He was briefly bridged with heparin gtt.

#. Pulmonary embolism s/p IVC filter:  He was initially
subtherapeutic on coumadin, received a dose of lovenox in the
ED.  He was briefly bridged with heparin gtt.

#. Hypertension: Pt was hypertnesive to the 190s at [**Hospital 7137**].  He was continued on BB and AceI at baseline.

#. Chronic colonic pseudoobstruction:  He was continued on his
home regimen including reglan.

#. Aspiration:  Pt has chronic aspiration.  He has not been
taking po's for some time and has PEG tube.  He was continued on
his tube feeds.

#. Depression - Continue citalopram

#. Gout - Continue allopurinol

CODE STATUS: DNR/[**Hospital 24351**] Hospice, no invasive or painful
procedures, no escalation of care except for antibiotics,
treating respiratory distress with morphine.
