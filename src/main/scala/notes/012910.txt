Service:  PURP [**Doctor First Name 147**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female
with coronary artery disease status post myocardial
infarction in [**11/2124**] with antecedent symptoms of colonic
obstruction, found to have a worsening stricture of the
sigmoid colon by flexible sigmoidoscopy on [**2124-10-18**].  She
deferred surgery at that time for family reasons and then
subsequently had a myocardial infarction.  She now presents
with worsening abdominal cramping and bloating over the past
few weeks.  She was referred by her primary physician who
requested surgical reassessment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
in 12/[**2123**].
2.  Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 70%.
3.  Atrial fibrillation.
4.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
5.  Sigmoid colon lesions.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Neck squamous cell carcinoma.
2.  Oophorectomy.
3.  Cataracts.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg once a day.
2.  Toprol XL 50 mg once a day.
3.  Lasix 20 mg q. Tuesday and Thursday.
4.  Colace 100 mg twice a day.
5.  Metamucil unknown dose.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 98.6 F.; pulse 82; blood
pressure 112/56; 18 respirations; 95% on room air.  The
patient is a pleasant elderly female in no apparent distress.
Oropharynx is clear with surgical pupils.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  The patient's heart rate is
irregularly irregular with distant heart sounds.  Abdomen on
the right was nontender.  Abdomen on the left with no masses,
but slight tenderness.  Extremities with plus two pitting
edema bilaterally.  Right pretibial abrasions.  Rectal with
questionable anterior shelf.  No luminal masses.  Guaiac
positive.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the
Purple Surgery Team and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She was started on a
clear liquid diet and continued her Colace for now.
Intervention and GI consult for consultation of attempting
colonic stent was sought.  On [**2125-2-13**], Cardiology was
consulted and they recommended beta blocker, holding Lasix,
questionable stent.  On [**2125-2-13**], a GI consultation was
obtained.  They recommended that the patient would benefit
most from surgery as during prior colonoscopy.  Unable to
pass scope beyond the stricture and barium enema shows a cut
off.  They believed that it would be very difficult to place
a stent given the nature of the stricture; they will follow.

On [**2125-2-14**], the patient was taken to the Operating Room
for a sigmoid colectomy to address her near obstructing
diverticulitis.  The surgery was uneventful.  On [**2125-2-15**], postoperative day one, the patient was transferred to
the SICU for poor urine output and blood pressure control.
On [**2125-2-20**], the patient was transferred to the floor from,
the TSICU.  Blood pressure systolic was in the 120 to 140
range and off pressors.

She responded well to Lasix and was negative 1200 cc on
[**2125-2-18**].  Cardiology and Surgery agreed with this decision
to move her to the floor.

The patient was seen by Physical Therapy and by Nutrition
while in-house.  The patient was advanced to full diet with
p.o. pain medication.  The patient was placed back on
Coumadin and her INR was monitored closely.  The remainder of
her hospital stay was uneventful.

DISPOSITION:   The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation
center.
