HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75-year-old
gravida 5, para 2-0-1-2, who presented with probable ovarian
cancer.  She had previously been seen by a surgeon for repair
of her hiatal hernia.  On a preoperative chest x-ray a large
left pleural effusion was noted.  This was removed with a
thoracentesis twice.  The patient reports that the cytology
results were inconclusive.  This prompted a CT of the abdomen
and pelvis which revealed a large amount of ascites.   There
was a probable appearance of seeding with some nodularity on
the anterior surface of the peritoneum and the mid and upper
abdomen.  There seemed to be some nodularity of the
mesenteric fat.  There was an ill-defined soft tissue mass in
the right lower abdomen and pelvis.

The patient reported a 40-pound weight loss over the past few
months.  She had shortness of breath prior to the
thoracentesis but is currently is much better.  She had
constipation which is a big change for her.  She denies any
bleeding from any site.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Asthma.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Arthritis.
4.  Hiatal hernia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Breast lump removal.
2.  Vaginal hysterectomy.

ALLERGIES:  QUININE and SULFA.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Current medications included
Lasix, Accupril, Lipitor, Evista, [**Last Name (LF) 44137**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], Serevent,
Flovent, Flonase, albuterol, Percocet, and Compazine.

PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY:  Two vaginal deliveries.

PAST GYNECOLOGICAL HISTORY:  Last PAP smear was one year ago

and was normal.

FAMILY HISTORY:   The patient has had two sisters with lung
cancer.  A daughter with breast cancer.  No history of
ovarian cancer.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient does not smoke or drink.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Review of systems revealed a 40-pound
weight loss over two months.  She has occasional shortness of
breath which is improved with her thoracentesis.  She has had
constipation.  She has muscle and joint pain occasionally.
Review of systems is otherwise negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:    On physical
examination, she was well-developed but thin.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose, and throat revealed sclerae were anicteric.
Lymph node survey was negative.  Lungs were clear on the
right, but the left was dullness to percussion two thirds of
the way up the lung field.  Heart was regular without
murmurs.  Breasts were normal.  The abdomen was soft and
distended with obvious ascites, suggestion of multiple
palpable abdominal masses.  Extremities were without edema.
On pelvic examination, vulva and vagina were normal.  On
bimanual and rectovaginal examination, the vaginal walls were
smooth, cervix was surgically absent.  A palpable mass in the
cul-de-sac on rectal examination which was intrinsically
normal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted after being
consented for surgery.  She underwent a exploratory
laparotomy, drainage of ascites, bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and tumor debulking.
Please see the Operative Report for a detailed discussion of
the case.

The patient did well postoperatively.  She was sent to the
Intensive Care Unit due to her multiple medical problems.
She was extubated without any complications.  A chest tube
was placed in the Intensive Care Unit, and on postoperative
day two she was sent to the floor for observation and
management during the rest of her hospital course.

The remainder of her hospital course was uncomplicated.  Her
pain was managed with Demerol and Vistaril.  Her chest tube
was removed on postoperative day seven.  She was saturating
100% on room air prior to discharge.  A left apical
pneumothorax was visualized on chest x-ray two days prior to
discharge.  It was stable before discharge.  A CT scan was
also obtained which confirmed this finding.

The patient tolerated orals.  Her urine output was an issue,
but she responded very well to Lasix.  She did not require
any Lasix before discharge.  Her electrolytes had to be
repleted.  Her potassium and magnesium; specifically.  Her
blood pressure was under control as well as her asthma
throughout her hospital course.  She was started on all of
her outpatient medications while in house.  She was also
given albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers.  She had an internal
jugular line which was also removed prior to discharge.  Her
staples were to remain in place until she was seen by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**]
in the clinic.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON DISCHARGE:  Her discharge
laboratories were as follows; hemoglobin was 10.3, hematocrit
was 32.1.  Sodium was 137, potassium was 3.9, chloride
was 103, bicarbonate was 26, blood urea nitrogen was 11,
creatinine was 0.5.  White blood cell count was 8.  Calcium
was 7.2, magnesium was 1.5, phosphate was 2.6.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient was to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1022**] in the next few
days for staple removal.
2.  She was also to follow up with Pulmonary as discussed
with them for management of her lung issues; more
specifically, they will consider at that time whether or not
she needs anymore treatment.
3.  She was also given heavy lifting precautions and told to
return to the hospital for any nausea, vomiting, shortness of
breath, fever, chills, drainage from the wound, or vaginal
bleeding.
