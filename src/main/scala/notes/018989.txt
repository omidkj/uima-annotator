History of Present Illness:

HPI:
78yo woman with history of DM2, PMR on chronic steroids, and
recent admission for urosepsis now presents with two days of
minimal nausea and diffuse non-specific pain. She did
not have any hematemesis, melena/hematochezia. She denied any
specific abdominal pain, fever, chest pain, shortness of breath.

She had no specific urinary complaints.
.
She was just discharged to [**Hospital3 537**] from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-26**]
after a complicated hospital course with E. coli (pan-sensitive)
sepsis, likely from urosepsis. She was initially treated with
levo/flagyl, but changed to zosyn after there was concern for a
reaction (wheezing, neck swelling) to levaquin. The plan was to
complete a 3 week course of zosyn. Her hospital course was
complicated by hypotension, likely shock liver, and development
of a peri-hepatic hemorrhage with Hct dropping to 22 and
requiring multiple PRBC transfusions.
.
In ED, initial vitals were 99.0, 93, 74/48, 15, and 97% on RA.
She had an abdominal CT which demonstrated resolving
peri-hepatic fluid and pneumobilia, and a RUQ US demonstrating
no acute biliary pathology. UA was grossly positive for UTI. She
had a RIJ sepsis line placed, and was given nearly 3L in NS
boluses. IVF were running at 75cc/hr in ED. Her CVP upon
transfer to MICU was [**3-15**]. She was also given Ceftriaxone 1g,
Ceftazadime 1g, Vancomycin 1g, levaquin 500mg, and flagyl 500mg.

.
CT abdomen:
1. Stable appearance of perihepatic fluid.
2. Interval resolution of previously seen pneumobilia.
3. No new intra-abdominal or intrapelvic pathology identified to
explain the patient's abdominal pain.
.
CHEST AP: A right IJ line is visualized with its tip in the
right atrium. There are low lung volumes. The heart size,
mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable. There is some
bibasilar linear atelectasis seen. IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax.
No acute cardiopulmonary process
.
RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: Detail of the liver parenchyma
is not well evaluated. Again seen is fluid adjacent to the
liver,
although this is not as complex appearance as previously noted.
The
gallbladder appears normal without stones or wall edema. The
common hepatic duct is normal, measuring 4 mm.
IMPRESSION: Limited study, but no evidence of acute
cholecystitis or
cholelithiasis. Fluid adjacent to the liver
.
EKG: NSR, rate 100, NL axis, early R wave progression, J point
elevation in V1-V2.

HIDA scan [**11-4**]
IMPRESSION: Nonvisualization of the gallbladder consistent with
acute
cholecystitis.

[**11-5**] cholecystostomy tube placement by US guidance
Aspiration yielded likely infected material a sample of which
has been sent for analysis. Post-placement images show the
catheter within the gallbladder.
The catheter was secured with the pigtail device, 2.0 silk
subcutaneous anchor suture fixed to the catheter and dressings.
There is moderate amount of intra-abdominal ascites in the right
upper quadrant similair to recent imaging.

EKG: NSR, rate 100, NL axis, early R wave progression, J point
elevation in V1-V2.
