Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5608**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain and shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year-old male with a history of Pulmonary Fibrosis (home O2,
2L resting/ 4L ambulating), DM, CAD, PVD, s/p pacemaker who
presents with 2 days of chest pain and worsening SOB. He reports
2 days of left sided, non radiating, pressure/spasm chest pain.
The patient was rated a [**6-3**] and lasted a few minutes. The chest
pain occured in the morning when he woke up, but denied any
diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, or SOB. He also reports that
later this morning he felt more SOB then his baseline. He states
that his SOB has been progressive over the last few days. The
wife stated that they increased his O2 from 2L to 3L a few days
ago. He denied any fevers, chills, but perhaps slightly
increased cough and phlegm from his baseline. The patient lives
at home with his wife and at baseline gets dyspneic with <10ft
of ambulation. Additionally, per his outpatient Pulm Notes he
desaturates to 82% with ambulation on oxygen.
.
In the ED, initial VS: 98% on 5L, 115/80, 78. On admission the
patient was in the low 80's on 2L. He appeared tachypneic and
mildly uncomfortable. He was placed on face mask then weaned to
5L with sats 98-100%. He was going to be admitted to the floor,
but while he was eating and moving in his bed he desaturated to
the "high 70's." He was placed on a NRB and came up to 100% and
eventually weaned to 30% venti-mask at the time of discharge.
CXR showed b/l reticular interstitial opacities consistent with
pulmonary fibrosis without other acute changes. He had 1 set of
cardiac enzymes with trop 0.03, CK 61, MB 4. BNP 1373 (no prior
baseline). Pt received albuterol/ipratropium nebs.
.
In the ICU the patient denied CP and reported his breathing
improved and near baseline.


Past Medical History:
1. Coronary artery disease s/p cath & RCA stent '[**71**] (cath showed

90%, OM1 50%. LVEF of 48% with inf posterobasal hypokinesis.
2. Type 2 diabetes.
3. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.
4. Spinal stenosis.
5. Peripheral vascular disease (claudication bilaterally)
6. Status post DDD pacemaker placement in [**2173**] secondary to

CXR:
IMPRESSION: Findings most compatible with pulmonary fibrosis. No
clear
superimposed process is identified.

TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded (inferior wall not well seen). There is
no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with normal free wall contractility. The aortic root is
mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2172-6-16**], no definite change. Inferior wall not
well visualized on the current study.


Brief Hospital Course:
#Dyspnea: Pt with h/o pulmonary fibrosis with home 02
requirement of 2-4L. Prior clinic notes indicates that he
desaturates to 82% with ambulation. CXR did not reveal other
acute process such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema and most
consistent with pulmonary fibrosis. No clinical evidence of
underlying infection or viral URI. No fever, chills, worsening
cough, or leukocytosis. Elevated BNP (although no baseline),
mild lower extremity edema which was chronic per his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
patient was given 30mg IV lasix x2 to diurese and was negative
2L length of stay.  He was also treated with azithromycin for a
5 day course for possible atypical pneumonia.  An echo was done
to evaluate for worsening pulmonary htn and a bubble study to
look for a shunt that was negative and severe pulmonary HTN.  He
had an EF of >55%.  The patient continued to require
supplemental O2 and desaturates to the low 80's with ambulation
or movement.  This is consistent with his baseline.  He was
evaluated by Palliative Care and hospice was discussed given
that he has not wanted escalation of care, invasive procedures
or blood draws.  He deferred further discussion of hospice and
palliative care, which has been discussed previously.  His PCP
and pulmonologist are aware and should continued to be addressed
as an outpatient. The patient was discharged with increased
services at home.
.
#. Chest pain: Pt with h/o CAD s/p RCA stent in 98. pMIBI in
[**2180**] showed only fixed defects. No ECG changes and cardiac
enzymes were negative.  The patient refused additional blood
draws and remained chest pain free. He was continue on his home
aspirin.
