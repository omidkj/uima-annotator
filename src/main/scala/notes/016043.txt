Intra-op TEE [**2184-3-19**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is
mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 40%) with
visually-significant intraventricular dyssynchrony. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is present.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of aortic regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] A bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present.
The mitral prosthesis appears well seated, with normal
leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The degree of mitral regurgitation seen
is normal for this prosthesis. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No significant pericardial effusion.
Normally-functioning mechanical aortic and mitral prostheses.
Mild global biventricular systolic dysfunction with evidence of
hemodynamic RV/LV interdependence. Moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation. At least moderate pulmonary hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2184-3-15**] Mr. [**Known lastname 19688**] was taken to the operating room and
underwent Aortic valve replacement with a 23-mm St. [**Hospital 923**] Medical
mechanical valve and mitral valve replacement with a 27-mm St.
[**Hospital 923**] Medical mechanical valve with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. For surgical
details, please see operative note. Following surgery, he was
brought to the CVICU in stable condition. He initially required
fresh frozen plasma for increased chest tube output. Amiodarone
was started for episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation. He
otherwise maintained stable hemodynamics and chest tube output
improved over the next day. Within 24 hours of surgery, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. CVICU
course was otherwise uneventful and he was transferred to the
Step down unit on postoperative day one. Warfarin was started
and dosed for a goal INR between 3.0 - 3.5. Amiodarone was
titrated accordingly.  INR became supra-therapeutic, peaking at
8.7.  Fresh Frozen Plasma was administered, coumadin held, and
INR allowed to trend down.  Postoperatively he had brief
episodes of transient atrial fibrillation treated with
beta-blocker. It should also be noted that Mr.[**Known lastname 19688**] had a
leukocytosis, WBC peaked to 17.9.  He remained afebrile and
cultures remained negative. By discharge, his white count was
trending down to normal.The remainder of his hospital course was
essentially uneventful. Prior to discharge, arrangements were
made with [**Hospital 88272**] [**Hospital 197**] clinic, Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 4610**] to  manage his
Warfarin as an outpatient. POD#12 he was discharged to home. All
follow up appointments were advised. Target INR 3.0-3.5 for
mechanical valves.

medications until he can fill his meds at the free care pharmacy
on tuesday. ***********
