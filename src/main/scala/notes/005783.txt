History of Present Illness:
44 yo male with PMH HCV/etoh cirrhosis with known varices
presented to OSH for hematemesis. Per family, pt was found at
home by neighbor in pool in blood, who called EMS.
.
At OSH, pt was scoped by GI who saw bleeding esophageal vs.
gastric varix which they banded (no report sent over). Pt
re-bled and on re-scope gastric varices were seen but unable to
be reached. Pt was hemodynamically unstable with BP in 70s.
Intubated in setting of hemaodynamic instability and airway
protection. Initial hct at OSH was 29, INR 3. Given 10U PRBC, 5U
FFP, 10L NS. Started on octreotide. Also given thiamine, Vit K
10mg, Versed, Fentanyl, Vecuronium.
.
In our [**Name (NI) **], pt was hypotensive on arrival with SBP 60-70s, tachy
to 140. Intial Hct 30, INR 2, plt 66. Pt was given 4U of FFP and
4U of PRBC. Started on vasopressin gtt. Pt was seen by surgery,
who felt pt was not surgical candidate. Pt was also seen by IR
who feels pt is candidate for TIPS, however, they would prefer
to perform procedure in AM after stabilization. Pt is being
evaluated by Liver service.
.
On arrival to MICU, pt was hypertensive to 150s systolic, so
vasopressin shut off. L EJ was dislodged and removed; per
nursing there is concern that tip looks "jagged" - question of
if piece of tip left in vein. However, there was no difficulty
in pulling line out. ABG on AC 450/22/5/1 was 7.20/43/194 with
lactate 12.3. RR and PEEP increased, FiO2 decreased.

         Staphylococcus species may develop resistance during
prolonged
         therapy with quinolones.   Therefore, isolates that are
initially
         susceptible may become resistant within three to four
days after
         initiation of therapy.  Testing of repeat isolates may
be
         warranted.

IMAGING:
[**8-21**] CXR - Cardiomediastinal contour is within normal limits.
Right internal jugular vein catheter tip is projected in the
right brachiocephalic vein. ET tube tip projects 4.8 cm above
the carina. [**Last Name (un) **] tube is slightly deflated. Ill-defined
opacities in the left upper lobe, retrocardiac left lower lobe,
and right lower lobe are unchanged. Given the acute
presentation, these could be due to massive aspiration,
atelectasis or pulmonary hemorrhage. Stable small bilateral
pleural effusions. Right apical opacity is likely due to pleural
effusion, attention to this area should be paid in the following
studies to exclude hematoma.
.
[**8-21**] LIVER U/S - There is a small amount of ascites in all four
quadrants, however, not enough to safely mark for percutaneous
drainage. The most prominent pocket appears in the right upper
quadrant.
.
[**8-21**] PORTABLE KUB - TIPS seen overlying right upper abdomen.
Tubing seen overlying the mid abdomen. Bilateral central venous
line seen overlying the pelvis. No definite evidence of free air
seen on this supine film. Increased haziness seen diffusely over
the abdomen, likely represents ascites.
.
[**8-21**] TIPS -
1. Successful transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
placement. Pressure gradient was measured at the main portal
vein, which was 49 mmHg. Pressures in the portal vein after the
stent decreased to 43 mmHg, and inside of the stent was measured
as 38 mmHg.
2. Embolization of two separate coronary veins with ethanol and
5-mm coils.
.
[**8-22**] LIVER U/S - This exam is extremely limited secondary to
patient's body habitus and respiratory motion. A TIPS catheter
is present within the right lobe of the liver and only the
proximal and mid portions are visualized on today's study. There
is a proximal TIPS velocity of 115 cm/sec and a mid TIPS
velocity of 64 cm/sec. Wall-to-wall patency cannot be adequately
assessed. Normal flow and waveforms are demonstrated within the
main and left portal vein. A single hepatic vein is visualized
and demonstrates normal flow and waveforms. Normal arterial
waveforms are seen within the main, right and left hepatic
arteries.
.
[**8-22**] ECHO - The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion. Agitated saline contrast study
(at rest x2, patient on ventilator) revealed no intracardiac
shunt.
.
[**8-23**] CT head - No hemorrhage. Opacification of the paranasal
sinuses and left mastoid air cell.
.
[**8-25**] CT head -
1. No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
2. No evidence of radiographically visable fracture within the
skull base.
3. Soft tissue swelling around left mastoid consistent with
clinical findings.
.
[**8-25**] LIVER U/S - Study is again limited secondary to patient's
body habitus and respiratory motion. TIPS catheter again seen in
the right lobe of the liver demonstrating a velocity of 94-108
cm/sec at the proximal end of the TIPS, a velocity of 110-130
cm/sec at the distal end of the TIPS. Velocity in the mid
portion measures approximately 210-220 cm/sec. Because the
patient's respiratory motion, Doppler study of the TIPS was not
possible. Hepatopetal flow seen within the m
