On [**2184-3-16**], she underwent an AVR with a 19 mm
[**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial valve.  The cross clamp time
was 84 minutes.  Total bypass time was 130 minutes.  She had
a very slow cardiac output in the OR and was unstable.  She
was transferred to the CSRU on epinephrine, dobutamine, and
Levophed.  She had a lot of chest tube drainage.  She
required a lot of blood products and was immediately placed
on CVVH after surgery.  She remained intubated.  She received
17 units of packed cells, 50 units of platelets, 16 of FFP,
and 50 of cryo on her first postoperative 24 hours.

She was switched to Neo and milrinone and was still on her
epi but her hemodynamics improved significantly.  Eventually,
her bleeding slowed down.  She remained on CVVH.  She went
into atrial fibrillation.  She was started on Amio.  On
postoperative day number three, she was almost off her
milrinone and just an Amio drip.  She was awake.  She was on
CPAP.  She was doing very well.  She was stopped on the CVVH.

On postoperative day number five, her chest tubes were
discontinued.  She continued to progress.  She was off the
ventilator.  She required aggressive diuresis.  She also
required aggressive pulmonary therapy.  She continued to
improve.

She was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number
seven.  Her trach was changed back to her original metal
trach and she was breathing better.  She had a swallowing
study which revealed that she had profound aspiration and was
kept n.p.o.  She had a NG feeding tube placed and was started
on tube feeds.  She continued to progress.  She was being
diuresed.  She did have some intermittent shortness of breath
and was dropping her sats.  She was tapped on the left.  This
reaccummulated.  She ended up having a chest tube on the left
and was sclerosed with talc.  She tolerated that well and had
minimal drainage after that and her chest tube was
discontinued on postoperative day number 23.

She had another swallowing study a week after her first one
which showed some improvement but she was still n.p.o. but
then on postoperative day number 23 she also had a swallowing
study which showed that she could eat honey-thick liquids and
pureed food with supervision.

On postoperative day number 25, she was discharged to
rehabilitation in stable condition.
