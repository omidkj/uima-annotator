Brief Hospital Course:
this 53-year old male with a history of with DM I, insulin
autoimmune syndrome, systolic CHF, and CRI admitted for
recurrent hypoglycemia, initially cared for in the intensive
care unit, then transferred to floor.
.
# Diabetes Mellitus - Patient had long history of recurrent
hypoglycemic episodes and difficult to control blood sugars,
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10088**] as outpatient as Josline Diabetes
Center.  Patient was treated with 4 doses of IVIG therapy, with
a total of 160mg (30mg, 50mg, 40mg, 40mg. Patient's lantus doses
were varied during his stay, discharged on 4units [**Hospital1 **], as [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) **] recommendations, in addition to sliding scale.  Level of
insulin auto-antibodies was 2, within reference range.
.
# Anemia - As per outpatient evaluation, patient diagnosed with
anemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency anemia.  Anemia of
chronic kidney disease more likely etiology.  Patient had low
level hematocrit during his stay.  Prior to his discharge,
hemolysis labs were checked with consideration for IVIG-induced
hemolysis.  B12 and folate levels were normal. Patient was
continued on his PO iron and was restarted on his most previous
epogen dose the day prior to his discharge.  Patient's
hematocrit should be checked within 2-3 days. He showed no
evidence of bleeding, but warrants outpatient GI evaluation for
iron deficiency.
.
# Pancytopenia - Noted over the 3-4 days prior to his discharge,
patient had mild drop in all his cell lines without known
etiology.  No apparent medications could be elucidated as the
cause - clonidine has very rare side effects of
thrombocytopenia, although this was initiated after the downward
trends.  Patient was given a prescription and explicit
instructions to have blood work done on [**3-13**], with results
sent to the [**Last Name (un) **] Center, and then to be re-evaluated on [**3-15**] as an outpatient.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure - Creatinine baseline around
3.4, baseline unclear but appears to be somewhere between
2.5-3.5.  Patient maintained good urine output during his stay.

.
# Hypertension - Per report had been diffuclt to control on the
outpatient setting.  Patient was continued on diltiazem,
hydralazine, and toprol.  Amlodipine was discontinued because of
lower extremity edema, and clonidine patch was initiated.  His
other anti-hypertensive medications were continued.
.
# Asymmetrical swelling in legs - Patient had bilateral lower
extremity swelling, that switched sides during his stay, which
prompted a lower extremity ultrasound, which was negative for a
deep vein thrombosis.  His amlodipine was discontinued, as
above.
.
#  Subclinical hypothyroidism - will need to be addressed on
outpatient basis.
.
#  Liver lesions - as per outpatient notes, patient had
noticeable liver pathology on previous scans, was scheduled to
have MRI complet
