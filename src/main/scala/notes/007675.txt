HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 64-year-old white male with
multiple medical problems including tracheal stenosis,
tracheal malacia, status post recent photodynamic treatment
and endobronchial stent, osteoarthritis, coronary artery
disease, congestive heart failure, who was transferred with
fevers, tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxemia.  The patient
has a long history of tracheal stenosis and tracheal malacia
following a long period of intubation while hospitalized at
[**Hospital6 2561**] from [**2121-10-1**] to [**Month (only) 958**] to [**2123**]
for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair complicated by graft
infection requiring revision.  The patient also has a history
of endotracheal cancer discovered at bronchoscopy.  The
patient underwent laser photodynamic therapy for stenosis
endotracheal cancer in [**2123-9-1**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The
patient was admitted from [**10-30**] to [**11-6**] for
elective procedure by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as well where he received
tracheal and left main bronchus stents complicated by
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bronchitis and
diarrhea.  The patient was discharged to complete a course of
vancomycin, ending on [**11-14**].

For the past 10 days the patient had noticed shortness of
breath, dyspnea on exertion, and cough productive of
blood-tinged yellow sputum.  He has also noticed worsening of
chronic bilateral left lower extremity edema and paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea.  He denies chest pain or abdominal pain.
Found unresponsive by his wife earlier this morning.  The
patient was unable to recall a syncopal or suffered trauma;
details unclear.

The patient presented to [**Hospital3 **] Emergency
Department by Emergency Medical Service who gave the patient
Lasix 40 intravenously and MS04 without relief.  At
[**Hospital1 3494**], the patient had a temperature of 101, heart rate
of 140, blood pressure 139/60, respiratory rate 32, SpO2 93%
on nonrebreather, and a white blood cell count of greater
than 20,000.  Arterial blood gas was 7.26/58/85/23.  The
patient was given intravenous Lasix, nitroglycerin paste,
Bumex, BiPAP, albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers, and Rocephin
intravenously.  Given complicated pulmonary history
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further evaluation and management.  In the ambulance, the
patient had drop of blood pressure to the 80s for which he
was started on a dopamine drip and intravenous fluids.

He was given a single dose of vancomycin and Levaquin in the
Emergency Department.  Heart rate was 140, down to 100, blood
pressure 106/45, respiratory rate 28, 96% on a nonrebreather.
The patient was placed on BiPAP in the Emergency Department
with improvement in SpO2 to upper 90s.  Complaints of
shortness of breath and orthopnea.  Arterial blood gas was
7.36/53/60/31 on BiPAP 10 and 5.  Given complicated pulmonary
history and hypoxia the patient was electively intubated by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by bronchoscopy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives at home with his wife.  A known

Previously a pilot.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature 100.7,
heart rate in the 100s, blood pressure 100 to 110/40s,
respiratory rate 15 to 28, oxygen saturation 99% on PEEP, 10
on pressure support 5.  General, an obese, uncomfortable
white male, in mild respiratory distress.  HEENT revealed
pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  Mucous
membranes were markedly dry.  Heart was distant, a regular
rate and rhythm, without murmur, rubs or gallops.  Lungs
revealed bilateral basilar wet crackles anteriorly decreased
breath sounds.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended, decreased bowel sounds.  No masses.  Midline
surgical incision was well-healed.  Extremities revealed 2 to
3+ pitting edema bilaterally.  Neurologically, alert and
oriented times four.  Motor strength was [**6-5**] in the upper and
lower extremities bilaterally.

LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell count
23.5, hematocrit 40, platelets 204; 77 neutrophils, 4 bands,
5 lymphocytes.  Sodium 138, potassium 3.2, chloride 99,
bicarbonate 27, BUN 24 (which was 17 on [**11-6**]),
creatinine 1.5 (which was 1.1 on [**11-6**]), glucose 143.
Creatine phosphokinase 196, MB 6, troponin I was 0.8.
Urinalysis revealed moderate blood, 0 to 2 red blood cells,
rare bacteria, trace protein, 3 to 5 white blood cells.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed sinus
tachycardia at 105, left axis deviation, 0.5-mm ST
depressions in II, V4 through V6.

Chest x-ray revealed possible left lower lobe infiltrate,
cephalization, hilar prominent with diffuse bilateral
alveolar infiltrates.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  He was quickly weaned off the dopamine.
He had a left subclavian placed as well as a arterial line.
He had an echocardiogram done which showed left atrium
moderately dilated, left ventricular cavity was normal, left
ventricular function depressed, but ejection fraction could
not be determined, mild aortic regurgitation.

The patient was continued on Levaquin and vancomycin and
started on steroids.  Thought likely to have a component of
congestive heart failure, pneumonia, and sepsis.  As blood
pressure got better, the patient was able to be gently
diuresed.  The patient was successfully intubated without a
problem.  Subclavian and arterial line were removed.  Urine
culture was no growth to date.  Blood cultures showed
Staphylococcus aureus which ended up being
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  Renal function
improved quickly and thought likely to be prerenal in
etiology.

On [**11-28**], the patient was transferred to the floor.  He
had been ruled out by enzymes for myocardial infarction.  On
the floor, the patient remained afebrile.  Oxygen was weaned
off.  Lasix was slowly restarted.  Norvasc was stopped, and
ACE inhibitor was started at a low dose as the patient has
had congestive heart failure.  He was started on
captopril 6.25 mg t.i.d. and then changed to Mavik 0.5 mg
q.d.

He underwent bronchoscopy to examine the stents.  The stents
were patent, but there was much secretions.  In addition an
tracheal stenosis of 0.5 cm proximal to the stent was found,
and it was recommended that likely he would need resection of
the stenosis with electric cautery and silicon stent placed
at some point.  Mucomyst was added to outpati
