Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 47-year-old male
with recent inferior myocardial infarction.  He is status
post successful right coronary artery stenting x2 in the mid
RCA secondary to a finding of 90% stenosis.  Patient states
that he was involved in a sell of an automobile when he began
to have chest pain.  Pain radiated down left arm, became to
feel clammy and within 15 minutes after onset of symptoms,
EMS was called.  He does not remember what happened next.  He
was found unresponsive by EMS, no radial pulse, faint
carotids, and shallow breathing.  Blood pressure at that time
was 70/40.  He was given a 500 cc bolus.  Blood pressure
increased to 76/42.  Additional bolus was given.  Blood
pressure increased to 80/44.  Initially, it was opted to give
dopamine, however, because of the response to the additional
bolus, none was given.

Patient was then taken to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital, where he
received Heparin NTNK.  At that time an electrocardiogram
showed ST elevations in the inferior leads.  After one hour
of receiving the [**Last Name (LF) 51858**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] elevations resolved, however, the
patient continued to have 10/10 chest pain.  The patient was
then transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital to [**Hospital3 **] for
emergency stent placement.  Stents were placed in the mid RCA
secondary to findings of a 90% stenosis.

The patient arrived at CCU at approximately 8 pm.  Patient at
that time was found to have mild chest pain and shortness of
breath that was gradually worsening.  It was later found that
patient had a history of asthma, and was therefore opted to
give patient ipratropium via nebulizer.  Patient was given
cardiac protocol medications for acute myocardial infarction
which consisted of Plavix 75 mg, metoprolol which was started
at 12.5 mg, aspirin 325 mg, and Lipitor 10 mg.  Patient was
started on IV fluids at 100 cc per hour.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  None.  Occasional use of albuterol for
asthma.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Asthma.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Knee surgery secondary to fracture.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Two packs of cigarettes per day x20 years.
No alcohol use for 15 years.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother:  Congestive heart failure.  Father:
Five major heart attacks, first heart attack at age 51.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Generally, fairly normal asymptomatic.
HEENT:  Positive history of headaches/blurriness of vision
x3-4 months.  Heart:  No pedal edema, no palpitations.
Positive PND, subscapular pain times the last four days.
Lungs:  No cough, pneumonia, tuberculosis, positive for
yearly bronchitis.  Abdomen:  No recent weight loss or gain,
no melena.  Hematology:  No history of anemia,
thrombocytopenia, or hemophilia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Patient's vital signs on admission:
Pulse 57, respirations 16, blood pressure 100/55.  He was
sating 100% on 2 liters of O2 via nasal cannula.  HEENT:
Within baseline.  Heart:  Normal S1, S2, no S3, S4 noted, no
murmur appreciated.  Lungs:  Bilateral wheezing, no crackles.
Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds, nondistended, and nontender.
Extremities:  No edema, right groin area and area of
catheterization incision site, positive small hematoma, no
drainage, and mild tenderness.  Good DP/PT pulses.
Neurological within baseline.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 15.5,
hemoglobin 14.5, hematocrit 43.4, platelet count of 279, MCV
of 88, neutrophils 83.3, PT of 12.3, PTT of 37.4.  Chem-7:
sodium 139, potassium 5.3, and later potassium [**Location (un) 1131**] was
3.9.  Chloride 108, bicarb 22, BUN 14, creatinine 0.9,
glucose 96.  CK 184, CK MB 11, index 6.0, troponin-T 0.26.

Arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.26, CO2 42, O2 104,
bicarb of 20.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Showed a prolonged P-R interval, sinus
rhythm, no ST elevations in inferior leads.  Secondary to
prolonged P-R interval, Lopressor was then held.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
Patient on [**8-14**] at approximately 7:30 am, was found to be
very hypotensive with a blood pressure of 60/40.  No pulses
were noted.  It was then noted that in the right arm, patient
had a blood pressure of 80/40.  The 20 point difference was
noted.  Chest x-ray was ordered.  Electrocardiogram showed no
changes.  Chest x-ray was found to be within normal limits.
Patient was given 2 mg of dopamine and a 500 cc bolus of
normal saline.

Patient's blood pressure responded well to this and we were
able to start the Lopressor at 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Patient was
later found to have chest pain described as [**4-4**].
Electrocardiogram was done, and showed no ST elevations.  No
change from electrocardiogram done on admission.  Pain was
relieved with Morphine and nitroglycerin.

Echocardiogram was done on patient on [**8-15**]:  Showed 40%
ejection fraction with mild biventricular hypokinesis, normal
sized right and left ventricle, normal sized right and left
atrium, mild mitral regurgitation.  Patient was later found
to have complaint of back pain.  This pain was, however,
reproducible with pressure.  The patient states that he had a
history of this same pain and it was treated with NSAIDs.
The patient was advised that he would not be able to use
NSAIDs at home status post with his history of myocardial
infarction.

On [**8-16**], the patient was found to have 20 point difference
in systolic blood pressure.  Brachial pulses were both
dopplerable.  Radial pulses were +2.  Good DP and PT pulses
in both feet described as +2.  It was decided that patient
was stable and able to go home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lisinopril 5 mg.
2. Lopressor 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].
3. Aspirin 325 q day.
4. Lipitor 10 mg.
5. Plavix 75 mg po q day x30 days.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to followup with Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3613**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 10:15 am on [**8-22**], and follow up with Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 919**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 911**] at [**9-5**] at 1 o'clock pm.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Inferior myocardial infarction.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged today.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Excellent.
