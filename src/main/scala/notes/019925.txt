Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension and hypoglycemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
78 yo M with NSCLC on paclitaxel/carboplatin followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] (Atrius) admitted from rehab with hypoglycemia. CXR
at rehab was suggestive of pneumonia. In speaking with the
patient he does not know why he was sent to the ER but does
endorse a cough and says he is usually not on oxygen.
In the ER his initial vital signs were: T 97.0 HR 115 BP 113/57
RR 18 SaO2 96% room air. He had a CXR which showed an opacity in
the area of his known tumor but overall looked improved from
previous. He was noted to have neutropenia, acute renal failure
with Cr 1.7 up from 1.0, K of 2.9, and hypoglycemic to 29. He
was not thought to have pneumonia and did not receive
antibiotics and did not have a documented fever and there is no
report from [**Hospital1 599**] Senior Health in [**Location (un) 55**] that he had a
fever either. He was given 1L NS and an amp of D50 with
improvement in his FSG to 90. He also received 20meq of K. Noted
to be incontinent of large amount of liquid green stool.

He was admitted to Oncology service for further management.

On arrival to the floor, the patient was lethargic with tremor
of the tongue and arms and had a FSG of 30. He was given an amp
of D50 with improvement in FSG to 140 with increased alertness.
The patient does not know why he was admitted and says he
usually does not require oxygen. He did endorse a wet cough but
without sputum production. He denies fever.

TTE: [**2134-4-1**] Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal
(LVEF 65%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is a small posterior pericardial effusion. The
effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or
other cellular elements. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was transferred to the ICU for hypotension and presumed
sepsis. The etiology was thought to be related to his C. diff
infection, which we managed with PO vancomycin and IV Flagyl.
He was volume resuscitated and his BP improved along with
antibiotic therapy.  Lactate was mildly elevated to 2.5 at
admission which was thought to be due to his sepsis and
hypotension.  We also considered whether this was related to his
inguinal hernia and the potential for incarceration.  Surgery
evaluated the patient and felt that there was no evidence of
incarceration and this was not a likely cause for his elevated
lactate.

While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he also converted into atrial fibrillation
with good rate control on no nodal blocking agents.  It is
unclear [**Name2 (NI) 92242**] he has a history of paroxysmal Afib, there are
no records to suggest that he has been in this rhythm in the
past.  He remained well rate controlled without pharmacologic
agents.  TTE showed evidence of [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 1915**] which may have been
a cause of his conversion to AF.  Anticoagulation was deferred.

He was transferred to the floor on [**4-2**] where he has been
stable.

PROBLEM LIST
# C-difficile Sepsis - Hypotension/tachycardia likely due to
severe C.Diff infection, as other sources were not revealing of
infection (pulmonary - film acutally looks better, UCx with
yeast).  He was treated with PO vancomycin and IV flagyl. No
other obvious sources and all cultures, other than C. diff, have
been no growth to date so far. No CT e/o toxic megacolon. He was
on neosynephrine for a few days and after multiple liter
boluses, was weaned off, though his pressures remained in the
high 80s-90s systolic. Lactate was trended, reaching it's
maximum at 2.5, then subsequently trending down to 2.2 prior to
transfer to the floor. Because of his initial septic picture, he
was also started on IV vancomycin/cefepime in the setting of his
neutropenia, but this was discontinued as the cultures were
negative and there was a known source of infection. Other causes
of his hypotension were considered, such as cardiac tamponade
and adrenal insufficiency. However, pulsus was ~10 and ECHO did
not show any radiographic evidence of tamponade. Steroids were
considered, but pt had a cortisol stimulation test on his
previous admission that was normal, and there was concern for
bowel perforation in a person with c.difficile colitis on
steroids. Pt continued on PO Vanc/IV Flagyl while on the floor
and on discharge only PO Vancomycin to complete a two-week
course from [**3-30**] - [**4-13**].

# Atrial fibrillation - New onset at midnight on [**4-1**], with no
known h/o AF.  MAP decreased during this time, which may be due
to loss of atria
