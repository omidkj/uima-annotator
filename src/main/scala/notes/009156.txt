Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 545**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation
PICC Line
Femoral Line
Arterial Line

History of Present Illness:
69F h/o CAD s/p multiple stents, ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF
25%), DM2, asthma presenting with acute shortness of breath and
altered mental status.
.
The morning of admission at nursing home, initially noted to be
diaphoretic and in mild respiratory distress. At that time,
tympanic T 92.1, BP 90/60, HR 90, RR 28, O2sat 98% 2L, FSBG 104.
Developed altered mental status (A&Ox1) and non-bloody
'greenish' emesis x4. EMS activated, who noted crackles and LE
edema on exam so was given lasix 80mg IV en route. On arrival in
the ED, vitals: T 99.0, BP 90/41, HR 60, RR 18, O2sat 97% on 2L.
Labs notable for WBC 6.1, Hct 38.5, lactate 1.3. U/A negative.
CXR revealed pulmonary edema but no clear infiltrate.
.
Believed to be in CHF and BiPAP attempted but failed due to
altered mental status and increased work of breathing, and
therefore she was intubated. Post-intubation became hypotensive
with SBP 70-90s despite 4L NS fluid resuscitation. Difficult
access, unable to place left or right IJ, so right femoral
triple-lumen placed and was started on dopamine gtt with
improved BPs.
.
There was concern for a possible new cardiac event, but ECG felt
to be unchanged from baseline (has chronic STE in V1-4). First
set of cardiac enzymes negative. Had already received ASA/[**First Name3 (LF) **]
at the nursing home, and heparin was not started. She was also
given antibiotics (vanc 1gm/levo 750mg/CTX 1gm) for possible
pneumonia, in addition to solumedrol 125mg IV and nebulizers
given COPD history. Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].


Past Medical History:

# CHF: last echo [**3-28**] with EF 25%, 1+MR, infero-lateral and
distal LV/apical akinesis

([**Company 1543**] [**Last Name (un) 24119**] DR)
# Hypertension

# h/o cerebral infarction by MR in [**2190**]
# s/p ccy
# Likely dementia (?-Alzhemer's vs. Vascular)
