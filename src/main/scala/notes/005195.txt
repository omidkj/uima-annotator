Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Percocet / Ciprofloxacin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4588**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, hypoxia, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
81 yo M w/ hx of CAD (3 VD s/p multiple PCAs [see below] most
recent w/ POBA to mid-RCA [**1-4**]), ischemic CM (systolic and
diastolic, last EF 40% 2/10), Parkinsons Dz, DM2, HTN, Renal
cell carcinoma (s/p L nephrectomy), TIA who presented from
rehabilitation facility with 2 days low grade fever,
deoxygenation and SOB.
.
Pt. was in USOH (deconditioned, fatigued, requiring 2L NC since
arriving at [**Hospital **] rehab, see recent d/c summary [**2185-10-6**]) until 3
days PTA when he developed low grade fevers (99-100F), with
worsening fatigue and cough productive of white sputum.  He
reported substernal dull CP w/o radiation or diaphoresis/nausea,
but did not recall duration.  His sx improved for one day,
however, on day of admission in AM, he was noted to have
worsening cough, increased RR and hypoxia to 86% on 2LNC.  Due
to this change he was sent to the ED for an evaluation.

In the ED, initial vs were: T99 P80 BP150/72 R20 99% O2 sat on
4LNC.
He was noted to require increasing oxygen to NRB, satting in
high 90s.  He was given ASA 325mg, Vancomycin 1g and CFTX 1g.
Due to no improvement, further lab tests were obtained and were
notable for BNP of ~ 30K (prior at 18K), troponin of 0.2 w/o CK
elevation, a dirty UA and Na of 149. EKG was reported as
unchanged from prior. His BP max was at 149, so he was started
on nitro gtt, given 40mg IV lasix (300cc UOP). and transferred
to the floor.
.
Pt. was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**9-25**] - [**10-6**] for delirium
(multifactorial), hypernatremia, yeast UTI treated with
fluconazole, episodes of hypotension and bradycardia, and
bilateral pleural effusions which were felt to be stable from
prior admission.
.
Of note, he has had b/l pleural effusions since his admission
for NSTEMI (medically managed) in [**2185-3-9**], which have progressed
in size until this admission. He has never had a thoracentesis.
.
Re: home oxygen, this was started in rehab after d/c from [**Hospital1 18**]
on [**10-6**].  Never fully investigated and used on prn basis.
.
Since discharge, he apparently also been diagnosed with
recurrent UTIs, and treated with Levofloxacin x 5 days, finished
on [**10-24**].  His Cx at [**Hospital1 18**] during prior admission were negative.

On the floor, VS - 84 132/70 28 94% NRB. Pt. appeared fatigued,
using accessory muscles, w/o complaints of CP, but c/o of SOB.

On Admission [**2185-10-26**]:
Limited study due to positioning and low lung volumes. Bilateral
moderate
pleural effusion, which is larger on the left and are similar in
appearance
from prior study ([**2185-10-18**]). Perihilar haziness with
mild upper
zone vascular redistribution likely represents mild volume
overload.
Bibasilar opacifications are lilely atelectasis, but concomitant
infectious
process cannot be excluded. The cardiac contours are obscured by
pleural
effusions. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. No
pneumothorax
is seen.
.
on [**2185-11-2**]
Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions have decreased in
amount from
prior study. Right PICC remains in place. There are low lung
volumes.
Cardiac size cannot be evaluated. There is no pulmonary edema.
Bibasilar
opacities consistent with atelectasis, left greater than right,
have improved.
