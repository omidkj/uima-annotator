Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Increasing chest pain and shortness of breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Coronary Artery Bypass x2 (LIMA-LAD, SVG-PDA), Mitral Valve
Replacement (27mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical)


History of Present Illness:
This is 62 year old male with known coronary artery disease.
Last [**Month (only) **] he underwent successful PTCA and stenting of his
left anterior descending artery. In addition, he has known
severe mitral regurgitation which has been followed by serial
echocardiograms which have demonstrated worsening mitral
regurgitation and increased pulmonary pressures. A repeat
cardiac catheterization was performed [**2185-4-13**] which
showed severe two vessel disease. Given the progression of his
symptoms, he has been referred for surgical evaluation.
Currently, he admits to mostly exertional symptoms. He
occasionally experiences chest pain at rest. He has 2 pillow
orthopnea. He feels his routine ADL's are moderately limited by
the above symptoms.

Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
This is a limited study because only esophageal views were
obtained. The patient has a history of gastric bleeding and
ulceration, and so gastric views were avoided.
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF
50-55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The jet is eccentric.
The anterior leaflet is very myxomatous and elongated.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Post-CPB #1:
The patient is paced, on epinephrine.
There is a mitral ring repair which has an eccentric jet of MR.
There is [**Male First Name (un) **] demonstrated on 2-D, 3-D and M-mode. Patient was
returned to CPB for MVR.
Post-CPB #2:
The patient is AV-Paced, on and infusion of epinephrine.
There is a prosthetic valve in the mitral position with no MR
and a mean gradient of 3 mmHg.
Preserved biventricular systolic fxn.
No AI. Aorta intact.
The tip of the SGC is at the PA bifurcation.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was a same day admission and brought to the
operating room on [**2185-6-24**] where the patient underwent CABG x2
and Mitral Valve Replacement with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Initial attempt
was made to repair his valve, however a transesophageal
echocardiogram revealed systolic anterior motion and an
eccentric jet of mitral regurgitation.  At this time it was
decided to replace the valve.  Overall the patient tolerated the
procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU
in stable but critical condition for recovery and invasive
monitoring.  He developed rapid atrial fibrillation and was
cardioverted to sinus rhythm with the aid of amiodarone.
Subsequently, he required electrical cardioversion.  Hemodynamic
support was achieved with epi, vasopressin and levophed for
several days post-operatively.  Coumadin was initiated for
atrial fibrillation and a mechanical aortic valve with a heparin
bridge until therapeutic. His laboratory values revealed acute
kidney injury and likely hepatic shock immediately
post-operatively, but these values trended toward normalization
with time.  He was treated for a Klebsiella pneumonia with
meropenum and ciprofloxacin per the recommendations of the
infectious disease service.
On [**7-7**] (POD 13), the patient was extubated and found to be
alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, weaned from
inotropic and vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated
and the patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative
weight.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for
further recovery.   He did develop a moderate left pleural
effusion.  It was decided to aggressively diurese this, rather
than perform a thoracentesis in the setting of elevated INR.
CXR will be followed as an outpatient.  The patient was
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with
strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge on POD 19 the
patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain
was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged
to the LifeCare center of [**Location 15289**] in good condition
with appropriate follow up instructions.
The [**Hospital 228**] rehab length of stay is expected to be less than
30 days.
