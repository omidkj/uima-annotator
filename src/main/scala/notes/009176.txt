Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**]
Chief Complaint:
newly diagnosied pericardial effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardialcentesis with drain placement and subsequent removal

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 82 y/o russian spekaing female w/ hx of breast
CA and prancreatic CA who is directly admitted for evaluation of
newly diagnosied pericardial effusion w/ tamponade physiology.
The patinet was diagnosed with pancreatic CA in [**3-24**] after
presentive w/ jaundice. Over the last month the patient has
noted new onselt leg edema, which as progressively worsened with
each day. The leg swelling does not limit the ADLs in this
self-described active women. Additionally, over this time
period, the normally hypertensive patient has been normo to
hypotensive, and her BP medication was discontinued.
The patient was recently at NYP hoslpital in NY 2d prior to
presentation as part of a preoperative evaltion for a Whipple.
An echocardiogram obtained on [**9-4**] showed a moderate to large
pericardial effusion causing both right atrial and right
ventricular diastolic collapse. She was recommended to have a
cardiology consultation but surprisingly, she was not offered an
admission to the hospital.
The patient returned to [**State **], and was seen by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic on the day of admission. The patinet
returned home after her clinic visit, and was called at home
this evening and told to come to the hospital.
In discussion with the patient, she had any episodes of chest
pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, presyncope or syncope.
Her breathing has been comfortable without any PND or orthopnea.
She has no prior cardiac history. She densies any recent
illnesses, fever, or chills. She has no hx of renal dysfunction,
CTD, or TB exposure. She is currently comfortable.

Echo [**9-6**] pre pericardiocentesis: The left atrium is moderately
dilated. The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a moderate sized pericardial
effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. No right atrial
or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.
IMPRESSION: Moderate-sized pericardial effusion without
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Preserved global
biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic regurgitation.

Pericadiocentesis: 1- Diagnostic pericardiocentesis with limited
removal of 7 CC of
markedly viscous fluid.
2- The patient developed a brief vagal episode with heart rate
down
from 90 bpm to 55-65 bpm and SBP down to 60-70 mmHg (down from
140-160
mmHg). Administration of Atropine (0.5 mg iv) and intravenous
fluids
lead to rapid restoration of baseline vital signs.
  FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Limited removal of 7 CC of markedly viscous pericardial
fluid.
Specimen was sent for laboratory analysis.

Echo [**9-6**] post pericardiocentesis: Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is a small
pericardial effusion. The effusion may be loculated. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
IMPRESSION: Small pericardial effusion. No tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2164-9-6**],
the effusion appears slightly smaller.

Brief Hospital Course:
A+P: 82 y/o with h/o breast CA, Pancreatic CA, presents with
pericardial effusion originally worrisome for tamponade based on
OSH echo. Pt only complains of LE edema, repeat echo without
signs of tamponade.
.
# Pericardial Effusion: Evidence of tamponade physiology On NYP
echo. No evidence of hemodynamic instability, with adequate BP
and no symptomatic effects. Low voltage on EKG c/w effusion.
Pulsus of 15 in clinic prior to admission, 6 on admission. Given
the size of the effusion w/ absence of a greater deal of
hemodynamic compromise, likely more of a chronic, slow growing
effusion. Large differential, but given pancreatic CA and hx of
breat CA, malignant pericardial effusion most likely. Effusion
[**2-18**] to thyroid dysfunction in this patient w/ hx of
hypothyroidism also a possibility. No viral illness to suggest
post viral etiology,
