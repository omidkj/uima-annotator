Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP

History of Present Illness:
This is a 38yo morbidly obese female with a past medical history
of asthma, sarcoidosis, hypertension and a question of diastolic
dysfunction causing congestive heart failure who was admitted to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] emergently following an ERCP that required an unplanned
intubation.
.
On [**7-22**], patient presented to the ED with RUQ pain, nausea and
vomiting. A RUQ U/S showed cholelithiasis without evidence of
cholecystitis. Patient was noted to have a mild transaminitis
and was admitted to the general surgery service for observation.
General surgery note from [**7-24**] states that plan for patient was
D/C if LFTs trending down v. ERCP if trending up. All liver
function labs from [**7-24**] trending down, however, patient
transferred East for ERCP. Patient also planned for
cholecystectomy following completion of ERCP in [**11-20**] days.
.
This afternoon, the patient was transferred East for ERCP. She
received ~1.5 L fluids peri-procedure and was ~3L positive
yesterday. Initially conscious sedation was attempted, however,
patient's sats dropped to the mid-80s when adequate sedation was
attained. There was a concern that the patient may have
aspirated during the procedure. It was noted that she had
abundant frothy white secretions as well. Per report, she was
difficult to sedate requiring 2mg midazolam, 120mg succ, 250mcg
fentanyl, and ~1g propofol. Per anesthesia, she was given nebs
thru her tube during the procedure. A biliary sphincterotomy was
performed with minimal sludge noted. Pt received one dose of
ampicillin with procedure.

* note - this d.c summary represents care on the pulmonary and
then general medical services.  For information on her hospital
course prior to her transfer to the ICU, please contact Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name (STitle) 468**].

38F with asthma, sarcoidosis and obesity who required intubation
during ERCP and was transferred to the ICU for failed
extubation. History of hospitalization from time of admission to
the ICU stay is unclear, as there is no written surgical history
and patient was admitted initially to the surgical service.
.
ERCP was done including sphincterotomy after baloon extraction
of sludge, no stones.
.
Respiratory Failure -
Patient was admitted to the unit after ERCP as she was difficult
to sedate with desats during a ERCP requiring intubation.
Concern that patient may have aspirated during the procedure vs
volume overload as patient has been several liters positive over
last 24-48 hours and has uncertain history of CHF [**12-21**] diastolic
dysfunction. Could also be due to fact that patient required a
large amount of sedation to overcome gag reflex. Patient was
weaned from AC to PS overnight and then sedation was weaned and
patient was extubated without complication and did not
experience recurrent respiratory difficulties throughout the
hospiatlization.
.
Transaminitis - LFTs on ICU admission were elevated, began to
trend down, patient is s/p ERCP with sphincterotomy [**7-24**]. Pt was
on general surgery service, attending [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name8 (MD) 468**], MD. Was
planned for cholecystectomy in next 1-3 days following ERCP. As
per general surgery plan to discharge from ICU to medical team
and then would follow up with plan for cholecystectomy in the
future. unclear what final plan was as patient was discharged
from hospitalist service.  On arrival to the Hospitalist
service, the patient was noted to be afebrile, tolerating
regular diet, denying abdominal pain, and transaminitis was
resolving on serum assays.  Pt. was sent home after conferring
with surgery who recommended outpatient follow up for evaluation
for lap chole in the future.
