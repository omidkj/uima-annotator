History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 y/o M with PMH of bipolar d/o, anxiety, and
alcoholism who presented last night at 5pm acutely intoxicated
with alcohol (ETOH level 409 in ED). He felt like he was a
danger to self and others because he was driving drunk. He
denied SI/HI. He was observed in the ED overnight and went to
sleep, when he woke up this morning at 9am was showing signs of
withdrawal. His last CIWA was 29 aT 1:30pm. He was admitted to
the MICU for increasing CIWA requirements. He has no history of
seizures or DTs. No hallucinations.  VS prior to transfer were

.
Of note he reports that for the past 3-4 weeks he has had sudden
episodes of dry coughing/choking that on 4 occassions have
resulted in him passing out. 2 episodes were witnessed and they
lasted only seconds and involved no bowel/bladder incontinence
or seizure like activity. On 1 occasion he fell to the floor
however he did not sustain any injuries. He reports that his PCP
diagnosed these as vasovagal episodes. He was put on clonidine
for these episodes however the patient reports that the
clonidine made him feel very run down and he stopped that
medication.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he is tremulous but reports that he
feels much better than he did when he arrived. He states that he
wants to get sober again. He had a recent 2 month period of

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 46 y/o M with PMH of bipolar d/o, anxiety, and
alcoholism who was initially admitted to the MICU for EtOH
withdrawal.
.
#. ETOH withdrawal: Patient presented to ED with acute EtOH
intoxication, with serum alcohol level 409.  He was observed in
the ED overnight; the following morning began to show signs of
EtOH withdrawal, and he was admitted to the MICU for increasing
CIWA requirements.  He was monitored per CIWA protocol Q1H, and
overnight received a total of 135mg PO valium.  The following
morning, he required an additional 50 mg valium.  He also
received a banana bag, and was then started on MVI, thiamine,
and folic acid daily.  Social work was consulted.  During his
MICU course, he did not have any seizures or evidence of DTs.
Once his benzodiazepine requirements decreased, he was
transferred to the general medicine floor on the evening of
[**10-18**].  He stated that he wanted to leave, although was convinced
to stay. The patient had required a total of 175mg diazepam over
the past 24 hours, including a total of 20mg diazepam at 2250
and 0100 [**10-19**].  This last dose was given and reduced his heart
rate from 120s down to below the 100s.  There was concern that
he was not answering the CIWA scale appropriately in an effort
to leave the hospital early.  The patient then slept during the
day of [**10-19**], again not [**Doctor Last Name **] on CIWA and then woke up around
1600, stating that he had a dress/ fashion show that he needed
to get to and that he was going to leave AMA.  We attempted to
bargain with the patient stating that he was still tachycardic
and had required more than 30mg over the past 24 hours of
diazepam.  We had previously asked that he stay until [**Doctor Last Name 766**]
morning, however he refused, stating that he had to attend/
coordinate the show.  Patient denied SI/HI and accepted the
risks of leaving AMA including seizure and death.  At time of
leaving AMA, the attending Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6420**] was called as well as
partner [**Name (NI) 83380**] Eres, with whom a message was left stating to
please follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6420**] on [**10-21**] or [**10-22**].
.
#. Bipolar D/O: Continued home meds.  Called PCP to clarify
medication regimen.  Per PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has been on amitriptyline
50mg QHS, lorazepam 0.5-1mg [**Hospital1 **] prn, divalproex 250ng TID,
seroquel 200mg QHS. This was continued while in house.
.
#. HTN: Likely related to EtOH/withdrawal, though may also have
been related to patient recently stopping clonidine.  Restarted
clonidine, at increased dose of 0.1mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Transaminitis: Likely related to EtOH use.  Should follow-up
with PCP and have hepatitis serologies sent if levels remain
elevated and these t
