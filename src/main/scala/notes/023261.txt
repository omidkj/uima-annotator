Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
unresponsiveness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 65 year-old male with a history of COPD on 3L home
O2 (not used in weeks), HCV, EtOH encephalopathy,
neuropathy/chronic pain on methadone and oxycodone presenting
from dentist's office after becoming unresponsive "with eyes
open" during a dentist visit.

He explains that this morning he woke up and felt nauseated
which he often does. No vomiting. He didn't eat anything and he
didn't take any of his home medications. He went on a short walk
with his girlfriend and afterwards he left for a dentist
appointment. Per report the girlfriend said that on the way to
the dentist he was swerving into curbs while driving and was not
paying attention to lights changing, and per ED had "slumped
over" by the time of arrival. According to his dentist (who I
spoke to in person) he seemed fine when he arrived and remained
so until a few minutes after he gave him an arcticain (similar
to lidocaine) shot in preparation for a cavity he was about to
fill. No complications with the injection, no excessive
bleeding, and he is confident he was in the gums. He was then
suddenly nonresponsive but with his eyes wide open. His dentist
called EMS who arrived within minutes.

He was given .5 mg narcan while en route by EMS and started to
wake up. On arrival to the ED, initial vitals were 98.5 100
103/66 16 99% 3L. He was apparently "sleeping with his eyes
open" and snoring. He was given 2 x .4 mg narcan, became
responsive afterwards. His labs were notable for a Cr of 1.9, up
from a baseline of .6, Hct 33 with baseline around 33-35, mild
AG acidosis, ALT/AST of 116/115 (last ALT 155 AST 99 on [**8-10**]).
He received 2 L of fluid down in the ED. He had a Tmax of 100.2
On transfer, he is awake and alert. He is being admitted to the
MICU for nursing concern.

Recent Pain Regimen: He reports recently having increased his
pain regimen. As he recalls it he was taking oxycodone [**Hospital1 **] at
baseline and then started methadone 4-5 days ago with no change
in dose of oxycodone. It is not entirely clear from the records
but per OMR prescriptions it looks like he has been on methadone
for a while but recently had his script increased from 5mg TID
to 40mg [**Hospital1 **]. There is a note in OMR from his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 2903**], who
is the prescriber of his narcotics, dated [**8-28**] mentioning that
he would be stopping the methadone. However, on OMR medications,
a prescription was written for 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] methadone dated [**9-19**],
without a no note from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2903**] in the system. According to his
daughter he was taking oxycodone 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and then took a bad
fall about 2 weeks ago while at home during which he hit elbow
and side of head. He did not go to hospital at that time. He was
then switched to methadone she thinks to try to wean him off the
oxycodone. He currently does not use any other substances. Last
alcohol was [**8-2**] and no regular use for a few years. No
history of seizure or DTs as far as he knows.

Weight Loss and Night Sweats: He reports a 30 pound weight loss
over the last 2 years (since retiring) which he credits
primarily to a very poor appetite as well as some
dysphagia/glubus. His appetite slightly improved on megace over
last few weeks but not that much. He has no pain with swallowing
but reports feeling like something is getting stuck in the back
of his throat. Only noted with solids. His dysphagia is mostly
just "feeling like something is stuck in my throat" but he
worries about choking which makes him reluctant to eat. Of note
he has a history of recurrent aspirations with a prior PEG back
in [**2122**]. His daughter says that he has also been complaining of
"drenching night sweats" which he has reported for the past
year.

Other Symptoms: He notes often feeling light-headed when sits
up. He takes his BPs at home and running low (SBPs 100s)lately.
He has frequent falls at home. He also reports significant
insomnia and vivid nightmares in the setting of PTSD from
[**Country 3992**].

Recent Admissions: Of note, patient admitted in early [**Month (only) 205**] after
fall, thought to be secondary to dehydration and decreased PO
intake. He also had an admission 3 months prior when he was
admitted for confusion, thought to be secondary to opiate
overdose, and was also found to have a pneumonia.

Care Providers: His daughter explains that he previously got a
lot of his care at the VA but hasn't in several months. The VA
actually cut him off 3 weeks ago because he was missing too many
appointments. His psychiatrist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2174**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13667**] is now out
of business due to a law suit. Stopped seeing him 1.5 years ago.
After that he went back to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3444**] to get his pain
medications.
