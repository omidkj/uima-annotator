CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2161-7-1**] 5:42 PM
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect.
.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2161-7-1**] 5:11 PM
IMPRESSION: Mild cardiogenic edema as above. Followup
radiography after appropriate diuresis recommended to assess for
underlying infection.

ECHO
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded.  Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated. Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation.  The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The left ventricular
inflow pattern suggests impaired  relaxation. Tricuspid
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial  effusion.
