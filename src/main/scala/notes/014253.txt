Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2182-12-9**] Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 4 (LIMA to LAD, SVG to
Diag, SVG to Ramus, SVG to OM)

History of Present Illness:
76 y/o male c/o increased dyspnea over last several weeks but
has increased in severity over last few days. Presented to OSH
and admitted with CHF. Subsequently underwent cardiac cath which
revealed severe three vessel coronary disease. Transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for coronary surgery.

Past Medical History:
Coronary Artery Disease s/p Myocardial Infarction, Hypertension,
Hyperlipidemia, Diverticulitis s/p colectomy, Degenerative disc
disease, left eye blindness, Bladder cancer s/p removal, s/p
Prostate surgery

Social History:
Cigarette h/o 50yr pack hx but quit in [**2150**]. Smoked [**9-14**]
cigars/day for last 25 years. Denies current ETOH use (last
drink in [**2168**]).

Family History:
Father had MI at 40 y/o.

Physical Exam:
VS: 57 18 163/80
Gen: NAD
Skin: Multiple healed scars on abd
HEENT: left eye blind otherwise PERRLA
Neck: Supple, FROM, -JVD
Chest: CTAB -w/r/
Heart: RRR -c/r/m/g
Abd: Soft, NT/ND +BS
Ext: Warm, well-perfused, -edema, -varicosities
Neuro: A&O x 3, MAE

Pertinent Results:
[**12-5**] Carotid U/S: Minimal plaque with bilateral less than 40%
carotid stenosis.
[**12-5**] Vein mapping: Duplex evaluation was performed of both
lower extremities. The greater saphenous vein on the right is
patent with diameters of 0.19 and 0.3, the lesser 0.14-0.22. On
the left, the greater shows diameters of 0.18-0.3 in the lesser
0.17-0.26.
[**12-5**] Chest CT: 1. Moderate emphysema. 2. Bibasilar septal
thickening and peribronchiolar ground-glass opacities, probably
representing CHF with hydrostatic pulmonary edema, but
differential diagnosis includes a viral pneumonia as well as
more chronic interstitial diseases. 3. Four noncalcified
pulmonary nodules measuring up to 6 mm in diameter. Followup CT
in six months is recommended per the [**Last Name (un) 8773**] guidelines to
exclude the possibility of a small lung cancer. At that time,
the interstitial abnormalities can be reassessed for resolution.
4. High attenuation of the gallbladder suggesting vicarious
excretion of contrast. As the patient received recent iodinated
contrast administration, there are also apparent dependent small
calcified gallstones. 5. Marked atherosclerotic calcifications
in the abdominal aorta and proximal renal arteries. 6. Punctate
calcifications in the kidneys and small cystic lesion in upper
pole of the left kidney. 7. Three-vessel marked coronary artery
calcifications.
[**12-6**] Echo: The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with inferior and septal akinesis and apical
akinesis/dyskinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is moderately to severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonic
valve leaflets are thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 79857**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac surgery. He was appropriately worked up which included
usual lab work along with PFT's, Carotid U/S, Echo, Vein
mapping, Chest CT, and GI consult. On [**12-9**] he was brought to the
operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft
x 4. Please see operative report for surgical details. Following
surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. Later on op day he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op
day one he was started on beta blockers and diuretics and gently
diuresed towards his pre-op weight. Later on this day he was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further care. On POD #2,
he went into A Fib and was treated with amiodarone. Chest tubes
and epicardial pacing wires were removed per csurg protocol. He
was placed on Keflex for an erythematous mediastinal incision.
He made good progress and was cleared for discharge to home with
services on POD 4.
