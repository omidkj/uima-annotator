History of Present Illness:
64 year old male seen by PCP for routine [**Name9 (PRE) 16574**] and mentioned
that he was having throat pain for over a period of a week. He
evaluated by cardiology and given his cardiac risk factors he
was admitted to the hospital and
underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed significant CAD
with 60%
LM.  He was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for surgical
evaluation.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnorality cannot be fully
excluded. No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Moderately dilated aorta at sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta. Mildly dilated aortic arch.
AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. No
MS. Trivial MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. No
TS. Physiologic TR. Normal PA systolic pressure.
GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.
Suboptimal image quality as the patient was difficult to
position. Suboptimal image quality - patient unable to
cooperate.
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal.


Brief Hospital Course:
Transferred in from outside hospital for surgical evaluation.
Underwent preoperative work up and on [**7-17**] was brought to the
operating room for coronary artery bypass graft surgery. See
operative report for further details.  He received cefazolin and
vancomycin for perioperative antibiotics and was transferred to
the intensive care unit for post operative management.  That
evening he was weaned off sedation, awoke neurologically intact
and was extubated without complications. On post operative day
one he was started on betablockers and diuretics.  Additionally
he was transferred to the floor.  Chest tubes and epicardial
wires were removed per protocol.  Physical therapy worked with
him on strength and mobility however his chronic back pain was a
limiting factor. He also had pulmonary congestion which was
treated with nebs, CPT and pulmonary hygiene. He was maintained
on on his home dose of vicodin and ativan. He continued to
progress and was ready for discharge to rehab at [**Hospital 100**] rehab on
post operative day #5.
