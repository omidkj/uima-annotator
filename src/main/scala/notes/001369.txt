Chief Complaint:
Throat swelling

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Placement of central venous catheter
Placement of triple-lumen foley catheter


History of Present Illness:
85 y.o. M with hx of HTN, AFib, GERD p/w with 1 wk hx of neck
swelling, dyspagia of solids and liquids, felt to have
supraglottitis, started on high dose steroids.  He initially was
started on steroids, but developed delirium and agitation,
requiring intubation for airway protection.  Steroids were
weaned off.  The cause of his supraglottitis was thought to be
angioedema [**1-24**] ACE-I, however pt states that he has been taking
his medicines for a long time.  Pt extubated, but had worsening
stridor, hypoxemia and reintubated electively.  He then
self-extubated on [**4-9**], but on [**4-12**] was found to be
unresponsive, hypercarbic and in PEA arrest, and reintubated.
Given atropine, epi and on pressors for 1 day.  Pt finally
extubated on [**4-16**], no respiratory problems since then.
Otherwise MICU course complicated by rapid AF requiring IV
lopressor, large amount of secretion, and sputum cx's with
e.coli and pseudomonas, started on Zosyn on [**4-15**] for sinusitis
by head CT on [**4-14**].  In addition, pt has required NGT for
nutrition given concern for aspiration, however pulled out
earlier today.  Video swallow study earlier today showed some
evidence of aspiration and assymetrical neck swelling.
On further hx pt admits to preceding subjective fever, denies
chills.  Also admits to lots of rhinorrhea, nasal congestion.  +
sick contacts with grandchildren.  He denies chills, diarrhea,
cough, shortness of breath, urinary sx's, rash, recent
medication changes.  He is followed at [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 669**] VA.  He was
born in [**Male First Name (un) 1056**], moved to US in [**2060**], unclear status of
vaccinations.

Pertinent Results:
[**4-2**] Neck CT:
FINDINGS: A moderate amount of soft tissue swelling is seen
within the peritonsillar region with no definite focal
low-attenuation lesion to suggest abscess. A preponderance of
soft tissue swelling is seen within the supraglottic region. No
pathologically enlarged nodes are identified.
Of note, significant amount of ossification is seen within the
anterior cervical spine consistent with DISH. This region of
ossification is displacing soft tissue anteriorly.
IMPRESSION:
1. Soft tissue density within predominantly supraglottic region
with no definite evidence peritonsillar abscess.
2. No evidence of lymphadenopathy.
3. DISH causing anterior soft tissue displacement of the
pharynx.
.
[**4-3**] Head CT:
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial bleed, mass
effect, shift of normally midline structures. Within the left
cerebellum, there is a focal area of low density, likely
representing volume averaging. No major vascular territorial
infarct is seen. No evidence of hydrocephalus. Small air-fluid
levels are seen within the sphenoid sinuses and mucosal
thickening is present within the ethmoid sinuses. The maxillary
sinuses and ethmoid air cells are clear.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
Sinusitis
.
[**4-14**] Sinus CT:
NON-CONTRAST SINUS CT: Mucosal thickening is seen in the right
maxillary sinus. Minor mucosal thickening is seen in the ethmoid
air cells. Both sphenoid sinuses show air fluid levels and
mucosal thickening. There is scattered opacification of the
mastoid air cells. No bony destruction is seen. The patient has
a smallbore nasogastric feeding tube. A tiny focus of air is
seen between the dens and the anterior ring of C1; the
atlantoaxial interval is still within normal limits. The right
ostiomeatal unit is not patent, although the left is. The nasal
septum deviates to the right of midline. Anterior clinoid
processes are not pneumatized. The sphenoid sinus septum inserts
roughly on the midline.
IMPRESSION: Sinusitis, slightly worse compared to the CT scan of
[**2115-4-7**].
.
[**4-22**] Neck CT
FINDINGS: The patient is status post extubation. Previously
noted lobulated soft tissue swelling in the supraglottic region
is not identified in the present scan. Oropharynx and
hypopharynx are patent and symmetric. No significant
lymphadenopathy. Note is made of cervical spondylosis, as noted
previously. The visualized portions of the lung apices are
clear. No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
IMPRESSION: Previously noted supraglottic soft tissue swelling
is not identified. Cervical spondylosis.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The inferior vena cava is dilated (>2.5 cm).
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular systolic function is normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild to moderate ([**12-24**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a  restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. The  tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
 artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic
regurgitation  velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery
diastolic hypertension.  There is no pericardial effusion.
