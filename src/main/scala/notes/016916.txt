Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 545**]
Chief Complaint:
Change in Mental Status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
74 yo M w history of alzheimers dementia, CAD, noted to be
increasing restless and his usual daycare. Was also agitated and
combative. Upon nurses assesment, pupils noted to be rolled back
in his head, and patient noted to have shaking tremors of lower
extemities.  All events witnessed by pt's wife and daughter who
were at Day Care withthe patient. Temp taken at Day care
registered at 103.1.  BP 130/82.  Family denied loss of
continence.  No LOC, family states that they were able to
communicate with the patient during the shaking episode.
.


When EMS arrived to daycare, pt noted to be more restless, very
talkative, twitching leg movements, agitated, combative.  EMS
arrived, found the patient  FS noted to be 58, given [**1-17**] amp
D50, BS improved to 166. Taken to [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
Pt baseline is not oriented, doesn't recognize family due to his
dementia, but is able to take care of ADLs (shaving, toileting,
eating).  Family reports patient entirely at baseline day prior
to admission, doing well, having gone to Temple during the
[**Hospital1 **] Holidays.  The lethargy and increased agitation is new
for the patient and is especially concerning given the high
fevers.
.
Unable to obtain ROS from the patient.  Per family, pt does not
have any CP, SOB, abd pain.  They did mention that patient does
occasionally c/o pain in his legs.  Denied cough, headaches,
dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.

<b>Studies:</b>
CXR: [**9-29**]:
FINDINGS: Upright portable chest radiograph is obtained. Midline
sternotomy
wires and mediastinal clips are noted, likely related to prior
CABG. The
lungs are clear bilaterally, demonstrating no evidence of
airspace
consolidation, effusion, or CHF. There is minimal subsegmental
atelectasis at the left lung base, likely in the left lower
lobe. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. The
visualized osseous structures are intact. Bowel gas pattern in
the upper abdomen is unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
No acute intrathoracic process
<br>
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2141-9-30**] 8:12 PM
Single AP view of the chest is obtained supine on [**2141-9-30**] at
[**2053**] hours and is compared with the most recent study performed
the prior day. Again seen evidence of prior cardiac surgery.
There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion which may be in part
due to the supine position and underinflation of the lungs but
fluid overload or early failure would be a concern. The degree
of respiratory motion in the chest makes evaluation of the lower
lung fields suboptimal however there is a patchy increase in
lung markings at both bases.
IMPRESSION:
Findings are likely a combination of the underinflation, supine
position and some fluid overload. Recommend a repeat examination
when the patient condition permits to exclude developing
airspace disease at both bases.

UNILAT LOWER EXT VEINS RIGHT  [**2141-9-30**] 3:44 AM
RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: Grayscale and color Doppler
son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of the right common femoral, superficial femoral, and
popliteal veins was performed. There was normal flow,
augmentation, compressibility, and waveforms demonstrated. No
intraluminal thrombus was identified.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of right lower extremity deep vein
thrombosis.
<br>
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2141-10-1**] 5:50 PM
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**9-30**] and earlier on [**10-1**]
symmetrical opacification in the lower lungs has developed over
the past two days, due in part to small increasing bilateral
pleural effusion. This could be either dependent edema or
aspiratio
