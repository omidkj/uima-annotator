Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Vomiting/Diarrhea


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Cath, s/p DES to RCA

History of Present Illness:
78 y/o woman with a PMH significant for DM and HTN who was
transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for STEMI. She states that
shortly after awaking at 0800 the morning of admission she
experienced sudden onset nausea, vomiting and non-bloody non
melanotic diarrhea with associated diaphoresis. She called her
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] urged her to go to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], where she was found
to have ST elevations in II/III/AVF and reciprocal ST
depressions in V2. VS at the time were: T 97.4 BP 131/61 HR 61
RR 18 O2 Sat 100% RA. She was given ASA 325, Heparin 60U/kg,
Atorvastatin 80 and Plavix 600 and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for PCI.


Cardiac cath showed total mid RCA occulsion (R dominant) and a
DES was placed with restoration of flow to the distal RCA and
PDA. Labs on arrival were CKMB 61 Trop 1.81 and Cr 1.7 (baseline
unknown).

On arrival to the CCU she denied CP/SOB/N/V/HA, palpitations or
lightheadedness. She has had no sick contacts and states she can
walk ~30 minutes before becoming SOB. She does not frequently
climb stairs due to degenerative disc disease. She denies
PND/orthopnea and states that she has noticed occasional
swelling in her ankles over the past few months.

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

RELEVANT STUDIES:
Cardiac Cath ([**2139-8-30**]):
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated single vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA,
LAD, and
LCx were free of angiographically significant disease. There was
a
thrombotic total occlusion of the mid-RCA with no
collateralization.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal resting systemic

arterial pressure.

[**Month/Day/Year **] ([**2139-8-30**]): The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There
is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls. There is a
focal defect in the basal inferior septum on 2D and color
Doppler with continuous left-to-right flow c/w a post infarction
ventricular septal defect (VSD). The remaining left ventricular
segments contract normally. (LVEF 50%). Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function may be more depressed given the
interventricular flow). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild to moderate
([**2-8**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CXR ([**2139-8-30**]): Current study demonstrates top normal heart as
well as bilateral hilar enlargement and pulmonary edema. The
findings might potentially represent a new acute mitral
regurgitation with increasing pulmonary venous pressure and
presence of newly developed pulmonary edema. Small bilateral
pleural effusions are noted. There is no pneumothorax.

[**Month/Day/Year **] ([**2139-8-31**]): The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
cavity size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the
basal half of the inferior and inferolateral walls. The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50-55 %). There is
a ~1cm basal inferoseptal post infarction ventricular septal
defect (VSD) with prominent left-to-right flow. Right
ventricular cavity size is normal with free wall hypokinesis.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a prominent fat pad.

[**Month/Day/Year **] ([**2139-9-3**]): The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinsis
of the basal and mid inferior and inferolateral segmets . There
is a post infarction ventricular septal defect (VSD). Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with moderate global free
wall hypokinesis. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
prominent fat pad.

MRI ([**2139-9-7**])

1. Normal left ventricular cavity size with normal global LVEF
of 65% albeit severely depressed effective forward LVEF of 20%.
