ICD firing X 2

none


History of Present Illness:
64 yo F with h/o non-ischemic cardiomyopathy s/p BiV-ICD, EF
5-15%, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation s/p ablation, severe
asthma, and reported episodes of v-fib vs. torsadesd de pointes
when she gets sick who presents after experiencing ICD shocks at
an OSH. In [**12/2145**], the patient experienced a syncopal episode
secondary to torsades and was shocked, upon which she had the
generator to her ICD changed. She was admitted to [**Hospital1 4494**] for fatigue and dizziness. While admitted, patient
experienced a fall, during which she was shocked by her ICD for
presumable torsades. A head CT and TEE were reportedly
performed, both of which were unremarkable. ? Electrolytes
deranged at OSH, got shocked twice at [**Hospital1 **] for Torsades.

TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

ECG [**2146-3-5**]: Sinus rhythm with atrial sensing and ventricular
paced rhythm. Possible left atrial abnormality. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2145-12-8**] no significant change.

CXR [**2146-3-6**]: Severe cardiomegaly is stable. Transvenous pacer
leads are in stable, standard position. There is no
pneumothorax. There are persistent low lung volumes. There are
no enlarging pleural effusions. Mild pulmonary edema is stable.

CATH [**2146-3-10**]: COMMENTS:
1) Right heart catheterization was initially attempted via
percutaneous
access of the right antecubital vein.  After introduction of a 5
French
introducing sheath in the right antecubital vein, a 5 French PA
catheter
was advanced proximally, but encountered resistance in the upper

mediastinum and could not be advanced toward the heart even with
0.025"
guidewire support and infusion of 200 mcg IV nitroglycerin to
alleviate
potential venous spasm.  The right femoral vein was therefore
used for
percutaneous access, and the 5 French PA catheter was introduced
via the
femoral vein uneventfully.
2) Resting hemodynamics revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension
with a
mean PA pressure of 40 mmHg.  Left-sided filling pressures were
moderately-elevated with a mean PCWP of 22 mmHg.  The computed
PVR was
379 dynes-sec/cm5 (4.5 [**Doctor Last Name **]).  The cardiac index was mildly
reduced at
2.08 L/min/m2. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. Moderate pulmonary arterial
hypertension most likely due to elevated left-sided filling
pressures.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 68F with with a PMH significant for
non-ischemic and ischemic cardiomyopathy (LVEF 5-10%) s/p AICD
and biventricular pacer, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation s/p
ablation, transferred from OSH with vent tachycardia and likely
CHF exacerbation here for further management.

# Ventricular tachycardia/torsades: The patient had 2 recent
episodes of ventricular tachycardi. Tranfserred here after an
appropriate shock for VT. Per EP Interrogation, ICD
Interrogation [**2146-3-5**]: VF: 2 events, [**2146-3-1**] at 19:31, rate 273
bpm, shocked 35J with successful cardioversion, preceeding
rhythm atrial tach [**2146-3-3**] at 22:40, rate 286 bpm, polymorphic,
successfulcardioversion with 35J, preceeding rhythm atrial tach
(CL ~500). Review of telemetry recordings from [**Hospital3 24768**]
, ECGs, and interrogation of ICD performed showed that QT
interval was normal, initiation of polymorphic VT/VF occured by
an early-coupled VPD, not "short-long-short" sequence of VPF.
Arrhythmias are due to worsening CHF, possibly precipitated by
worsening CHF. Above discussed extensively with patient. PPM
Chages included A amplitude decreased from 3.5 V-->1.5 V, RV
amplitude decreased from 3.5 V--> 2.5 V, LV amplitude increased
from 2.25 V to 2.75 V and AV delay increased from 200 ms. We
continued dig 0.125 and monitored her on tele, and didnt have
any events during her hopsital course.

# Systolic congestive heart failure: non-ischemia cardiomyopathy
with (LVEF 5-15%). transferred from OSH for further management
and concerns for potential worsening of CHF and to assess if she
is a candidate for LVAD or heart transplant.  We initially held
many of her home medication due to hypotension. RHC showed mild
to moderate pulmonary hypertension, PA 58/29 and PCWP 25. Echos
were performed to optimize his BiV settings. The
echocardiographic assessment showed no improvement in mitr
