Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
AMS

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with sCHF EF 25% (Echo [**2167-12-26**]), NIDDM, HTN, HLD,
history of AF/AVNRT, CVA, and other medical issues, recently
admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2167-12-25**] for CHF exacerbation with
hypotension and UTI treated with cipro, now presents to the ED
with AMS.
.
Per ED report, patient came from home with AMS since about 6AM.
The daughter says patient asked for water and crackers at 3AM
but then between 6:30-7AM appeared disoriented, unable to tell
where she was and did not recognize her daughter.  The daughter
was unclear if it was potassium, BP, or glucose problem, so
called EMS.  When EMS found her, her BS was in the 50s.  Her
mental status improved with 1 amp of D50, and BS improved to
160.  Per report, she did not have any SOB, chest pain,
abdominal pain, or N/V/D but has chronic LE edema and cold LE.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97F, HR 80, BP 85/45, RR 16,
difficult to interpret O2Sat.  LE pulses were dopplarable.  Labs
were significant for BNP up to [**Numeric Identifier 27326**] (highest value compared to
the past), creatinine up to 2.4 from baseline 1.0-1.1, troponin
of 0.1, and lactate of 3.4.  EKG, per report, showed sinus
bradycardia at 58, c/w prior but has prolonged QTc at 495, TWI
in lateral leads, Q in III/aVF, no STEMI.  Bedside ultrasound
apparently showed poor squeeze.  CXR, per report, showed
bilateral pleural effusion at baseline.  Patient was confirmed
to be DNR/DNI.  Family declined central line despite SBP 85->
70s.  Per report baseline MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 3584**] and oriented x 2, not to
time.  She received 250 cc NS bolus and 325 mg ASA.  Because O2
Sat was difficult to interpret, she was placed on 10L NRB at
93%.  Foley catheter was placed.

Of note, patient is on glipizide at home for DM.  Baseline
weight was 125 lb (56.7 kg) per the patient and discharge weight
was 64.7 kg on [**2167-12-30**].  Of note, she was discharged with
reduction of metoprolol from 100 mg to 50 mg, increased
torsemide from 25 mg to 100 mg, initiation of spironolactone 25
mg and losartan 12.5 mg daily.  She was treated with
ciprofloxacin for UTI.  She is unable to give the list of her
medications as her daughter handles her medical care.  She does
not use O2 at home.  Per the daughter, her baseline SBP usually
90-100.  However, since discharge, SBP goes to the 70s-80s/50s
intermittently.  She spoke with her cardiology and the plan was
to go down to torsemide 100 mg and 50 mg on alternating days and
to stop losartan starting on [**2168-1-7**].  Of note, she only
takes amiodarone twice a week.  She states the patient has been
eating well without fever or SOB, but patient always feels cold.

On arrival to the MICU, VS were T 33.1 (rectal), HR 58, BP
118/11, O2Sat 94-100% on [**6-19**] L.  Denies pain.  States a mild
cough since she got to the ED but not productive.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2168-1-8**]:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
25 %) secondary to severe global hypokinesis with focal inferior
and posterior akinesis. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The
right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with severe global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant
pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The main pulmonary artery is
dilated. The branch pulmonary arteries are dilated. There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with sCHF EF 25% (Echo [**2167-12-26**]), h/o CAD s/p stent,
HTN, HLD, NIDDM, h/o AF/AVNRT, h/o CVA, recent hospitalization
with CHF exacerbation/hypotention and UTI admitted to the ICU
for hypotension and hypoxia.

# Brief Hospital Course: Patient was admitted with hypotension
and hypoxia, felt most likely to be [**3-18**] acute on chronic sCHF
given physical exam findings and data. ACS considered given
elevated troponins, however CK-MB was wnl and EKG was unchanged.
Sepsis also considered given 1/2 blood cx growing GPC and she
was empirically started on IV vancomycin, however this was
thought more likely to be contaminant as she was afebrile with
nl WBC and had no focal s/sx of infection. Pt's clinical status
continued to deteriorate with increased O2 and pressors
requirement.  A family meeting was held, and it was decided to
change goals of care to comfort-measures only.  At 7:45PM on
HD#2, Ms. [**Known lastname 27320**] passed away. Family was present, PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 13109**].  Family dec
