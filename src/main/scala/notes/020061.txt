History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 39825**] is a 70 year old female with multiple medical
problems including atrial fibrillation on coumadin, sick-sinus
syndrome s/p pacemaker placement, CAD, CHF, type II diabetes,
rheumatoid arthritis, on chronic steroids, s/p AVR and MVR who
presented to the [**Hospital 882**] Hospital emergency department
overnight from her nursing home with the chief complain of [**9-12**]
chest pain and rigors/convulsions in her upper body.  Her inital
vitals ([**2-15**] at 1:30AM) BP 260/200 HR 85 Sat 93% RA.
.
At 3:30am, her SBP was 196 so nitro gtt was started and titrated
upward.  At 3:40am she was given lasix 80mg IV x1 and a foley
was placed.  Initial labs there were remarkable for a hct of 34.
 Her electrolytes and LFT's were essentially normal.  TnI was
0.32.  Her INR was also elevated.
.
At 4am she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  Her vitals here were BP
173/114, RR 14, Sat 97% 3L.  Nitro gtt was continued and some
ativan and morphine were given IV.  At 5am her BP was noted to
be 78/52 and per nursing notes had a spell of witnessed apnea.
Narcan was given with some response.  Her rectal temp was noted
to be 99.2.  CT angiogram was negative for dissection or PE.  At
5:50am, dopamine was started peripherally and titrated upwards.
At 6:10am a central line was placed in her R IJ. UA noted blood,
positive leuk esterase, mod bacteria, >50 WBC and hyphae.
.
At 7am her pressors were changed to neosynephrine.  The MICU
team was called for evaluation.   Levaquin 500mg iv was started.
 Levophed was reduced to 0.5mg/kg but SBP fell to the 80's.
Methylprednisilone was ordered but unavailable.  The patient was
transferred to the MICU for further care.
.
The patient says her pain began around midnight.  She has never
had this pain before.  She rates it [**9-12**] and it radiates across
her chest to her back.  She has had no relief from morphine.

Physical Exam:
VS: (on arrival to the MICU) T 98.4 HR 85 BP 265/202 RR 19 Sat
100% 2L NC
Gen: Pleasant elderly woman in no apparent distress.
HEENT: Dry MM, sclerae anicteric, mouth open.
Neck: right IJ in place with some mild bleeding.  No left
carotid bruit on left.  JVP elevated to jaw.
CV: Mechanical s1/s2, II/VI HSM at LSB, irregularly irregular
Pul: CTA anteriorly.  Crackles at bases.
Abd: Large midline scar on abdomen with granulation tissue,
healing.  Non-tender. +BS
Ext: 1+ RUE edema, trace LUE edema.  2+ RLE edema to ankle, 1+
LLE edema. Radial pulses 2+ RUE, 1+ LUE.  +Ulnar deviation.
Neuro: Awake, alert and oriented to person, place.  Myoclonic
twitching in UE bilaterally.

Pertinent Results:
EKG: AF, VR 70bpm, LBBB, intermittently V-paced beats .
.
CXR: Fluid overload, interstitial pattern
.
ECHO: [**2-15**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. A bileaflet aortic valve
prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is somewhat
higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. Significant
aortic regurgitation is present, but cannot be  quantified. A
bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis is present. The mitral
prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion
and  transvalvular gradients. Mitral regurgitation is present
but cannot be  quantified. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There  is no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2-16**]: US Abdomen:
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 10.6 cm. The left kidney
measures 10.2 cm. Normal waveforms are demonstrated within renal
arteries of the upper, middle, and lower poles. The RIs on the
right ranged from 0.66-0.73 within normal range. The right main
renal artery is patent. The main renal vein is patent. Waveforms
of the upper, middle, and lower poles of the left kidney also
appear normal; the RIs are slightly higher ranging from
0.73-0.79, mildly elevated. The main renal artery and vein are
patent. No masses, stones, or obstr0uction are identified. No
perinephric fluid identified. The bladder is decompressed.

IMPRESSION: Normal renal ultrasound with normal Doppler
waveforms, other than mildly elevated resistive indices on the
left.
.
[**2124-2-17**]: CT Abdomen and Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of renal artery stenosis.
2. Moderate atherosclerotic narrowing of the proximal superior
mesenteric artery that is patent. Patent celiac axis and
inferior mesenteric artery are seen.
3. 1.3-cm low-density lesions in the liver with imaging features
suggestive of hemangiomas; however, confirmation of this finding
cannot be performed given the absence of delayed phased imaging.
4. Heterogeneous enhancement of the liver associated with
ascites, pericholecystic fluid, effusions, and diffuse edema in
the soft tissues of the abdomen and pelvis. These findings raise
the possibility of hepatopathy resulting from the patient's
known cardiac dysfunction.
.
[**2124-2-18**]: Parathyroid Scan: IMPRESSION: A focus of persistent
tracer uptake in the region of the lower pole of the left
thyroid lobe, consistent with parathyroid uptake, is identified.
Additionally, there is very faint tracer activity within the
region of the lower right thyroid lobe, which may also represent
parathyroid uptake.
