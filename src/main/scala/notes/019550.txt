Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from an outside hospital for non ST elevation
myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure exacerbation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization without PCI
Coronary Artery bypass grafts x 4
(LIMA-LAD,SVG-Dg1,SVG-OM,SVG-RCA)& Mitral valve repair (28mm
[**Company 1543**] Annuloplasty ring)- [**1-14**]
Left heart catheterization, coronary angiography- [**1-4**]


History of Present Illness:
This is a 72-year-old female with a past medical history
significant for hypertension, diabetes, smoking, CAD s/p MI x3
most recently in [**10-25**] complicated by cardiogenic shock, s/p RCA
stenting x2 and LCx stenting x2, CHF with EF of 40%, MR,
pulmonary hypertension, and PVD s/p lower extremity stenting
transfered from an OSH for NSTEMI and CHF exacerbation.

In brief, she was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2188-11-11**] after a
prolonged hospitalization notable for a NSTEMI with stenting of
the LCx and hemodynamic compromise requiring a IABP. She did
well after discharge with improvement of her SOB and mobility.
She and her husband went on vacation during which time she
developed DOE, the CP mostly a night with no correlation to
activity. Her CP responded consistently to 1 to 2 NTG. She began
to notice orthopnea and PND as well as ankle edema. She had
nausea and SOB associated with her CP but not sweats or
dizziness. On [**2189-1-1**] she had a bacon and cheese omelet for
breakfast and clam chowder and [**Location (un) 20935**] steak with French fries
for lunch. That afternoon she began to have persistent CP and
SOB with associated nausea not relieved by NTG x3q5 minutes. EMS
was called and she was admitted to [**Hospital 67742**] Medical Center in
[**Location (un) **], N.H. where she was found to be atrial fibrillation and
pulmonary edema with and an admission proBNP of 5814.4. A
central line was placed and emergent cardioversion was
performed. She initially was hypotensive but stablized post
cardioversion. EKG revealed ST depression in the lateral leads.
Her TnI trended 1.17, 3.03, 8.9 consistent with an NSTEMI. She
was maintained on a heparin drip with aggressive diuresis. Proir
to transfer she had been on and off nitroglycerin drip. She has
chest pressure whenever it was shut off but she was hypertensive
when the nitro is increased. By report from the OSH she was
wheezing on admission. Her blood sugar on admission to the OSH
was 515 and she was briefly on an insulin drip with improvement
of her sugars. There is also a question of whether she missed a
dose of her beta-block dose prior to her admission. She was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.

She developed 7/10 chest pain with no ECG changes. She was
continued on heparin drip and NTG drip was restarted with
resolution of her CP.

She had recurrent chest pain w/ EKG chnages and was taken for an
emergent Coronary srtery bypass graft and MV repair om [**2188-1-14**].
