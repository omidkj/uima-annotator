Pertinent Results:
[**2156-10-18**] MRI head with and without contrast: There is
confirmation of an ovoid, irregularly rim-enhancing mass
measuring 23 x 32 mm within the right cerebellar hemisphere.
There is extensive surrounding edema, including compression of
the fourth ventricle. No other areas of pathological enhancement
are identified. The lesion exhibits very
low diffusion, which would argue against an inflammatory process
such as an abscess. The motion degraded FLAIR images suggest a
very minor degree of T2 hyperintensity within the white matter
of both cerebral hemispheres, becoming confluent in the
periatrial regions bilaterally. Given the patient's age, chronic
small vessel infarction would appear the most likely diagnosis.

[**2156-10-18**] CTA head: No definite hypervascularity is seen in
relationship to the cerebellar mass.

[**2156-10-18**] CT chest/abd pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. No primary tumor identified to account for metastasis.
2. There is interstitial lung disease with a basilar
predominance and
subpleural cysts consistent with interstitiell lung disease.
Centrilobular emphysema is present. A nodule within the lingula
measures 7 mm and is non- specific. Follow- up in 3 months is
recommended, alternatively this could be compared to prior
studies to ensure stability
3. A 3-mm nodule within the left lobe of the thyroid is noted
4. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2156-10-21**]
Status post resection of right cerebellar mass, with expected
postoperative changes, and no evidence of large
hematoma,increased mass
effect, or larger vascular territorial infarction

[**2156-10-22**]: MRI brain with and without contrast:
minimal amount of blood product within the postoperative bed. No
overt evidence of residual mass.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the neurosurgery service for work up
of a right cerebellar lesion.  He was started on antiemetics and
steroids which improved his symptoms of nausea and vomiting.
MRI was obtained to better evaluate the lesion.  CT Torso was
performed for metastatic workup but was negative for obvious
signs of primary disease.

After discussion with the patient and the patient's son and
Healthcare proxy, [**Name (NI) **], the decision was made to proceed with
resection of the mass.  A pre-op work up was done. He required
>400 units of Insulin twice during the day of [**10-20**] and his RISS
was adjusted. He was made NPO at midnight in anticipation of
surgery. MRI wand study was ordered for surgical planning.

On [**10-21**] the patient underwent a right suboccipital craniotomy
for resection of right cerebellar tumor. Post operatively
patient remained stable on examination. Post op head CT showed
post surgical changes, no acute hemorrhage, mass effect or acute
infarct. On [**10-22**], he was transferred to the floor and his diet
advanced. MRI Brain demonstrated no acute infarct.

He was seen and evaluated by physical therapy and occupational
therapy who fet that he would benefit from acute rehab.

On [**10-24**] and [**10-25**] the patient's Serum Na dropped to 130 and BUN
bumped, trending up to 36.  The hyponatremia responded to NS
fluid boluses and Serum Na improved to 133.  Labs were followed
closely.

On [**10-26**] Na and K were WNL. BUN was improving. He was
neurologically stable and cleared for discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
General Instructions/Information

??????	Have a friend/family member check your incision daily for
signs of infection.
??????	Take your pain medicine as prescribed.
??????	Exercise should be limited to walking; no lifting, straining,
or excessive bending.
??????	You may wash your hair 3 days after your surgery. Your wound
closure uses dissolvable sutures and the suture material will
fall out on its own - do not pull the sutures or scrub the
incision. Do not leave wet bandages or wet towels on the
incision.
??????	You may shower before this time using a shower cap to cover
your head.
??????	Increase your intake of fluids and fiber, as narcotic pain
medicine can cause constipation. We generally recommend taking
an over the counter stool softener, such as Docusate (Colace)
while taking narcotic pain medication.
??????	Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any
anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and
Ibuprofen etc.
??????	Continue to take your Keppra (Levetiracetam) as prescribed.
??????	If you are being sent ho
