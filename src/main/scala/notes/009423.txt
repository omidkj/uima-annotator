(which was unsuccessful) and elective resection of strictured

COMPLICATIONS.:  None.

ANESTHESIA:  General.

INDICATIONS:  The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a
recent CT scan in [**Location (un) 620**] showing a chronically obstructed
left kidney. There is a possible calculus along the route of
the left distal ureter, however, this is beyond the level of
obstruction.

PROCEDURE:  The patient was prepped and draped in lithotomy
position. A #22 French cystoscope was inserted into the
urethra which was normal. The bladder mucosa appeared
slightly atrophic, and the ureteral orifices were, however,
normal size and slightly laterally positioned.

A #8 French tapered catheter was gently inserted into the
left distal ureteral orifice and 5 cc of contrast dye was
injected which revealed a distal ureter with complete
retrograde obstruction. Beyond the level of obstruction,
was a very faint calcification, roughly 5-
8 mm in diameter, possibly consistent with the calcification
seen on CT scan. A straight sensor wire was attempted to be
placed beyond the strictured area but was unable. We then
moved to an angled Glidewire and multiple attempts at passing
the Glidewire beyond the area of stricture were unsuccessful.
At this point the decision was made to abort the stent
placement rather than continued attempts at the wire
placement or ureteroscopy without wire access which can result
in
ureteral rupture.

The bladder was emptied and the patient was transferred to
the PACU stable.

PLAN:  The patient will likely require a left percutaneous
nephrostomy tube and possible antegrade wire access which may
allow retrograde access to the stricture and possibly the
stone.

PROCEDURE:  Exploratory laparotomy, lysis of adhesions (3
hours), rectosigmoid resection and coloproctostomy,
mobilization of the splenic flexure, repair of ventral
hernia, post colostomy.

INDICATIONS:  This patient had either diverticulitis or an
obstructing carcinoma of the rectum which we could never get
close enough to do a valid biopsy. She underwent radiation
which remedied whatever the lesion was. We never found any
carcinoma in the specimen and she did have evidence of
diverticular disease. She underwent resection and then a
protective colostomy because of the fact that the anastomosis
never seemed to heal and indeed the most recent barium enema
revealed that she did not have adequate healing and as a
matter of fact had several leaks, probably disruptive of the
anastomosis either because of tension, which I had doubted,
or because of the previous radiation. After preparation the
following procedure was carried out.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  Under satisfactory general anesthesia
the patient was placed supine and prepped and draped in the
usual manner. We opened up the left paramedian incision and
were able to free-up of lysis of adhesions in the pelvis
which were extensive and which required extensive revision
starting with the ligament Treitz taking down the previous
feeding jejunostomy, but in fact we were able to get the
entire pelvis freed up without any difficulty. Upon entering
the pelvis there were a number of adhesions that were quite
dense. These were taken down. We actually were able to take
down the small bowel. There was only one area where there was
ballooning out of the serosa which was later repaired with
interrupted 5-0 Prolene and we were then able to go to work
on the previous rectosigmoid which required rectosigmoid
resection in order to get an adequate connection with the
anastomosis on the bottom. There was a stricture at the
previous anastomosis. Initial attempt at irrigation did not
pass any fluid into the pelvis, only later when we mobilized
the colon and had a hole in it was there any irrigation that
came through. We mobilized the small bowel extensively in a
number of areas that were adherent to the pelvis. There was
an abscess which was then drained and irrigated with
gentamicin. We then cultured it as well prior to irrigating
with gentamicin. Finally after mobilizing the splenic
flexure, a 2-layer silk anastomosis was carried out with some
difficulty but finally a good anastomosis was obtained and
reinforced with the appendices epiploica.

In the meantime trying to mobilize the rectum I believe we
injured a branch of the internal iliac and we lost about 750
cc, controlling this with 5-0 Prolene; 2 units were given.

After this and the anastomosis we then changed gowns and
gloves for closure, irrigated and then checked for hemostasis
in the left upper quadrant, as well as around in the pelvis.
A closure of the hernia was done internally first with
approximating the fascia from within with interrupted 0
Vicryl sutures and then closing the peritoneum under it with
a #1 Vicryl suture. The wound was closed in layers. We
decided not to do a feeding jejunostomy because there was no
anastomosis between the mouth and the transverse colostomy.
The wound was closed in layers with #1 chromic catgut on the
peritoneum. Taking the rectus, which previously had been
separated and sewing it over the midline, #1 Vicryl on the
fascia, 3-0 Vicryl on the subcutaneous tissue and 4-0
Monocryl subcuticular closure. Two sponge counts and needle
counts were reported as correct by the nurse in charge. The
patient tolerated the procedure well. Estimated blood loss
was 750 cc. Urine output was scanty at about 60 cc for the
entire case but it picked up as soon as we took her out of
Trendelenburg. She may need some more volume and we did keep
her dry. It should be pointed out that we looked at the area
of the left ureter and indeed it looked like it was stenotic
right at the area with a large ureter above and may have been
radiated.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname 1743**] [**Known lastname 54371**] underwent cystoscopy, left retrograde
pyelogram, and attempted
left stent placement. After the procedure she was admitted to
the surgery service under the care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**]. T
