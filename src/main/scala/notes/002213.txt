Admission Date:  [**2124-3-28**]       Discharge Date:  [**2124-4-14**]

Date of Birth:   [**2047-6-24**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Cardiac Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This patient is a 76 year old
male with known left bundle branch block who was admitted to
the Medical Service for increasing exertional arm and back
pain.  Associated symptoms were dyspnea on exertion.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  History of malaria.
3.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
4.  Barrett's esophagus.
5.  Colonic polyps.
6.  Iron deficiency anemia.
7.  History of proteinuria.
8.  History of asbestos exposure.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Protonix 20 mg p.o. q. day
2.  Iron Sulfate
3.  Lisinopril

ALLERGIES:  Lobster.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient, on physical examination,
was afebrile with vital signs stable.  Head was atraumatic,
normocephalic.  No scleral icterus noted.  Neck was soft,
supple, no carotid bruits noted.  Heart was regular rate and
rhythm with a II/VI systolic ejection murmur noted.  Chest
was clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities
with no edema.  Pulse examinations were palpable throughout
bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2124-3-28**] to the Medical Service and taken for cardiac
catheterization which revealed a 50% occlusion of the left
main, 80% occlusion of the ostial left anterior descending,
95% occlusion of the left circumflex and 100% occlusion of
the mid right coronary artery.  In addition, echocardiogram
in [**2124-2-10**] revealed an ejection fraction of 25%, global
left ventricular hypokinesis and mild diastolic aortic root,
trace aortic regurgitation, 2+ mitral regurgitation and 2+
tricuspid regurgitation.  Cardiac Surgery was consulted on
the date of admission for evaluation and treatment via
possible coronary artery bypass graft.

At this time, the patient also had ongoing medical problems
including renal insufficiency with a creatinine up to 2.0 and
iron deficiency anemia.  At this time ACE inhibitor was held
and the patient was gently hydrated with 1/2 normal saline.
Between the date of admission and [**2124-4-2**], the
patient's chronic renal insufficiency appeared to stabilize
with a creatinine approximately between 1.8 and 2.0.  During
this interval time, the patient was approached and options
for surgery were discussed.  The patient agreed to surgery on
[**2124-4-3**] and went to the Operating Room for coronary
artery bypass graft times four, left internal mammary artery
to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to ramus,
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and saphenous vein
graft to right coronary artery.  For more details, please see
operative report.

Postoperatively, the patient went to the Cardiac Surgery
Recovery Unit.  On postoperative day #0 the patient was noted
to be in accelerated junctional rhythm, however, when his
rate slowed down the patient would commence to enter complete
heartblock.  The patient lost his atrial fibrillation with P
pacing and was unable to A pace when in complete heartblock.
His blood pressure remained labile, sensitive to rate and
rhythm changes and was being managed with Levophed GTT.  On
postoperative day #1, the patient was on Levophed and
Milrinone drips with a pressure in the 1-teens.  The patient
was extubated on postoperative day #1 and pressors were
continuously weaned over the day which the patient tolerated
well.  On postoperative day #2, the patient went into atrial
fibrillation with the rates in the 130s to 140s, otherwise
hemodynamically stable.  The patient was treated with
Lopressor 2.5 mg intravenously times two with good effect,
heart rate decreasing to the 1-tens.  The pacer settings were
changed appropriately and Amiodarone bolus 150 mg was given.
The patient converted to a rate of 40s to 50s with Amiodarone
bolus and required A pacing to maintain blood pressure and
indices.  Amiodarone drip was started shortly thereafter.
The patient was diuresed over the next several days with good
effect.  Creatinine was stable at 1.9 to 2.0.

On postoperative day #4, the patient again went into atrial
fibrillation and Amiodarone bolus was once again given.  The
patient went back into normal sinus rhythm and the patient
was on p.o. Amiodarone.  On postoperative day #5, later in
the day the patient was put on a heparin drip.  On
postoperative day #6, the patient was transferred to the
floor, and on postoperative day #7 the patient was started on
Coumadin with a therapeutic range of 2.0.  Of note, as well
is that postoperative echocardiogram revealed an ejection
fraction of 15 to 20%.  The remainder of the [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course was unremarkable.  The patient remained in
sinus rhythm with being loaded for Coumadin with INRs being
checked daily and in the meantime being on a heparin drip.

On postoperative day #11, the patient's INR was reacting
appropriately to Coumadin dosing at 1.6.  The patient was
still on a heparin drip.  The patient was deemed well enough
to go home with services with Lovenox to bridge the patient
until he was therapeutic.
