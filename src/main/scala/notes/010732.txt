placement. On admission to CCU he was without chest pain, SOB,
palpatations.

Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP


Pertinent Results:
.
ECHO: [**10-17**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal
inferior/inferolateral akinesis (probable distribution of the
RCA). The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 45%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD. No
clinically-significant valvular disease.
.
[**10-17**]
Carotid ECHO
IMPRESSION:
1. No significant ICA stenosis bilaterally (graded as less than
40% bilaterally).
2. Indirect findings suggesting an element of right vertebral
artery stenosis proximal to the area of interrogation.
.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo man with inferior STEMI, hemodynamically stable.
.
STEMI/CAD: pt with ST elevations in II, III, AVF and positive
cardiac enzymes. chest pain resolved. Patient taken directly to
cath from OSH and recieved BMS to RCA. He was on Integrillin for
18hours post cath.  On Nitro gtt, which was titrated off quickly
post cath. PAtient was started on Plavix 75 daily, ASA 325,
simvastatin 80, Lisinpril 2.5 daily, atenolol 25 daily. No
recurrence of CP after cath. Will follow up with Cardiolgist at
[**Hospital3 **].
.
Bradycardia: while in cath lab, normal HR since. RCA lesion,
distal to artery to AV node. Pt normotensive since, tolerating
BBlocker and ACE.
.
LE arm swelling: left arm larger than right, no pain, warm. has
history of numbness in b/l fingers. LE ultrasound shows noC|DVT
.
Hx of TIA: No residual deficits. no carotid stenosis. Patient
now on plavix and aspirin, so no need for coumadin in addition
to this.

Discharge Instructions:
1. You were admitted from an outside hospital with a myocardial
infarction, or a "heart attack."  You were taken emergently to
the catheterization lab and it was found that one of your
coronary arteries was blocked.  You had a stent placed to this
coronary artery.  You also had a carotid ultrasound to evaluate
the arteries that supply your brain.  It was found that your
carotid arteries are patent and without evidence of occlusion.
.
2. The following medication changes were made during your
hospital stay:
a) Coumadin was discontinued as you are now on plavix and
aspirin which serve as blood thinners to decrease your risk of
stroke.
b) Plavix and high dose aspirin were started.  It is imperative
that you take both of these medications to minimize the risk of
your stent occluding.
c) You were also started on simvastatin, lisinopril and atenolol
for your heart.
.
If you have any of the following symptoms, you should return to
the ED or see your PCP:
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] pain, difficulty breathing, palpitations, or any other
serious concerns.

Followup Instructions:
You will receive a phone call from your PCP's office for an
appointment.  You should schedule your appointment and see your
PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] 5 to 7 days.  PCP: [**Name10 (NameIs) 39360**], [**Name11 (NameIs) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 36604**].
.
It it important that you obtain a referral to a cardiologist
from your PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] should follow up with a cardiologist in the
next 2 to 3 weeks.
