Cath
RCA had 95% PDA which had BMS placed.  LCx had 90% stenosis
which was not intervened upon

Cath [**2146-3-9**]:
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography demonstrated multivessel
coronary
artery disease. The right coronary artery demonstrated a widely
patent
stent in the mid portion of the vessel.  The left main
demonstrated a
30% lesion in the distal portion of the left main coronary
artery.  The
left anterior descending artery demonstrated a long calcified
70% lesion
in the proximal to mid portion of the vessel.  The large first
diagonal
branch had a 70% ostial lesion.  The left circumflex
demonstrated a
discrete 70% lesion in the distal portion of the vessel.  The
first
obtuse marginal branch demonstrated serial 70% lesions.
2.  Pressure wire interrogation of the long lesion in the LAD
demonstrated a resting FFR of 0.78 which dropped to 0.67 with
maximal
hyperemia.
3.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the obtuse marginal with a
Minivision (2.75x14mm) bare metal stent.
4.  Successful POBA of the first diagonal branch prior to be
jailed with
a 2.0mm balloon.
5.  Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal - mid LAD with
two
overlapping bare metal stents jailing the first diagonal branch
(Minivision 2.75x28mm distally, 2.75x18mm proximally).  Final
angiography demonstrated no angiographically apparent
dissection, no
residual stenosis in the LAD and 30% stenosis in the first
diagonal with
TIMI III flow throughout (See PTCA comments).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful PTCA and stenting of the obtuse marginal with a
bare metal
stent.
3. Successful POBA of the first diagonal branch.
4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the proximal - mid LAD with
two
overlapping bare metal stents.

TTE:
The left atrium is dilated. There is severe symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal for the patient's body size. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is an abnormal systolic
flow contour at rest, but no left ventricular outflow
obstruction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Severe symmetric LVH with even more severe
hypertrophy of the upper septum. Abnormal resting LVOT flow
without obstruction. No regional wall motion abnormality.
Hypertrophied right ventricle with normal size and function.
Mild aortic and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Biatrial
enlargement. Short E-wave deceleration time. This constellation
of findings could be consistent with an infiltrative process
such as amyloid.


Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo male with a history of questionable CAD, first degree AV
block s/p pacer placement presents with an anterior wall MI.
.
# STEMI:  Pt had evidence of anterior wall ST elevation MI on
ECG and in the cath lab.  First set of CE's CK 89, Trop 0.02 and
stayed stable. Patient also continued with mild 2/10 chest pain
after his cath. He was started on a Nitro gtt and continued on
integrillin overnight however in the morning he was still
complaining of chest pain. He was taken back to the cath lab and
had BMS placed in LAD after pressure wire demonstrated it to be
a significant lesion. He also had BMS placed in LCx as well as
POBA of first diagonal. Cardiac enzymes continued to be flat. He
was continued on aspirin and plavix. He refused high dose
statins and thus was started on rosuvastatin 20mg every other
day. Low dose beta blockers were re-initiated. His blood
pressure was low so he was not started on an ace inhibitor in
the hospital but his outpatient cardiologist will discuss this
with him at his visit
