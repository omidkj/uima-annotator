Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 9965**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
52F w/ PMH of hypothyroidism who presented to [**Hospital1 **] ED yesterday
with shortness of breath and cough.  She reports a 2 wk history
of new-onset shortness of breath, cough and dyspenea with
exertion which has worsened significantly. The cough is
productive with yellow sputum.  She initially saw her PCP and
was prescribed what sounds like a 5d course of azithromycin,
which finished on [**12-25**], but had no improvement of her
symptoms.  She reports the most comfortable position is sitting
upright because lying down provokes her cough.  She has had
occasional subjective fevers.  She also reports one month of
increasing ankle edema.
.
At [**Hospital3 **] ED, she was found to be hypoxic to the 80's.
CTA chest showed "early ARDS vs multifocal PNA innumerable tree
in [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities".  She received solumedrol, ceftriaxone,
azithromycin, and nebs.  She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED on
a non-rebreather for possible ICU admission.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were: 97.5F, HR 90, 131/58, RR
24, sat 94% 15L Non-Rebreather. She was on 6 L NC, but desated
to 88% so she was restarted on a nonrebreather and transferred
to the ICU for persistent hypoxia.

EKG: Rate 88, sinus rhythm, normal axis, no ST segment changes
.
On arrival to the ICU, her vitals were 97.0F, HR 103, 92% on
facemask -> 98% on non-rebreather
.
Review of systems:
Intermittnent subjective fevers. No chills, night sweats, recent
weight loss or gain. Denies headache. Reports some mucus from
nostrils. Reports cough, dyspnea as per HPI. Denies chest pain,
chest pressure, palpitations. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. Denies
dysuria, frequency, or urgency. Denies arthralgias or myalgias.

month.

Brief Hospital Course:
52F w/ PMH of hypothyroidism who presented to [**Hospital1 **] ED yesterday
with shortness of breath and cough.  She reports a 2 wk history
of new-onset shortness of breath, cough and dyspenea with
exertion which has worsened significantly.
.
# Hypoxemic respiratory distress: On admission the differential
diagnosis was felt to be very broad and included infectious,
autoimmune, and toxic etiologies. Given her 2 weeks of symptoms
of cough and fevers - in combination with her CT findings of
tree and [**Last Name (LF) 239**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] infectious etiology seems more likely. Although
she did not respond to a one week course of azithromycin, her
symptoms and chest imaging are more consistent w/ atypical
rather than a typical staph/strep pneumonia. Patient does work
on an airforce base, but usually in the kitchen, and she states
that she had a negative PPD skin test. Pt does not have any
exotic exposures, but mold hypersensitivity is a possibility
given her leaky roof and mold in her bathroom (her beta glucan
and galactomannan returned negative). Her industrial exposure
may also have caused some baseline lung dysfunction, but the
onset of her symptoms is acute and CT does not show the
typically nodular appearance of silicosis or beryllium. Pt did
not have a flu vaccination this year, but symptoms are atypical
for flu - she was also ultimately negative on nasopharyngeal
swab for respiratory viruses. Urine legionella was also
negative; induced sputums X3 were negative for acid fast
bacteria. Pt may have an autoimmune or vasculitic process, but
again appearance on CT is not typical for this, and she has no
personal or family history of autoimmune disorders. The patient
was initially treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin and then
narrowed to just levofloxacin. She was intially on nonrebreather
and could not be weaned without desaturations to 85-88%. She was
trialed on nasal CPAP and tolerated this well, with O2
saturations 93-94%. The patient's HIV antibody and HIV viral
load were negative. Her histoplasma negative and
hypersensitivity panel was negative and quantiferon gold was
negative. She was able to wean down to 5L NC and stable for
transfer to the floor. On the floor she was seen by pulmonary
who felt her presentation was most likely secondary to
infection. At the time of discharge her resting sats were normal
but ambulatory sats dropped to the high 80s. She was discahrged
on oxygen with plans for out-patient PCP and pulmonary
[**Name9 (PRE) 702**]. She completed her full 8 day course of levaquin.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Stable
- The patient was continued on home 100mcg of levothyroxine


Medications on Admission:
Levothyroxine 100mcg daily
NKDA

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
hypoxic respiratory distress/bronchiolitis likely seconday to
pulmonary infection


Discharge Condition:
The patient has a stable mental status and is ambulatory with
oxygen.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with shortness of breath, low oxygen and a
likely lung infection. Your oxygen level has improved but you
will still need oxygen at home. You should follow-up with your
appointments as attached. Your PCP and pulmonary doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) 91760**] when you can go off oxygen.
