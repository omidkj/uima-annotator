Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7455**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia and decreased mental status.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right central line placed.  Removed on [**2152-4-30**].


History of Present Illness:
Patinet is an 86 year old woman with COPD on 2L at baseline,
congestive heart failure, and a resident at [**Hospital1 10151**] facility who was transferred due to concern for
decreased mental status and hypoxia. On day of admission, she
developed hypoxia, requiring a 100% NRB to maintain good
saturation. Vitals on transfer were BP 100/60, T 102, and she
was given morphine 8 mg SL. EMS was called and per verbal
report, during transfer SBP dropped to 60s but this responded to
2L NS. According to personnel at rehab center, patient has had
increased difficulty breathing over past week.  Treatment was
started with Lasix, albuterol, levofloxacin, and prednisone
taper.
.
In the ED, patient was obtunded and febrile to 101.3 F axillary.
 RR was in the 30s, HR was 161, and blood pressure was in the
70-90s.  On presentation, a central line was placed under
standard sterile conditions. ED staff noted patient has had
significant diarrhea while there, also witnessed an aspiration
event. She was treated with solumedrol for possible COPD flare,
blood gas obtained which showed ph 7.32, co2 72. Labs in ED
otherwise notable for leukocytosis, bicarbonate 41, creatinine
1.5, and sodium 152.
ED staff discussed with pt's son, her HCP. Confirmed that she is
DNR but would want intubation. She was treated with vancomycin,
ceftriaxone, and metronidazole. 1.4 mg Narcan was given with
some response.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course/Assessment/Plan:
Patient is an 86 year old woman with COPD, CHF, who was
transferred for an acute respiratory hypercarbic hypoxemic
failure thought to be due to COPD exacerbation.  Patient with
pronounced diarrhea, with cultures negative.  Hypernatremic and
resolving renal failure.  Cultures to date negative.
.
.
1)Infectious Process:
On admission to the MICU, patient thought to have sepsis and
severe hypovolemia in the setting of diarrhea.  Concern for
aspiration pneumonia or infectious diarrhea. Reccurent episodes
of pneumonia and COPD exacerbation concerning for potential
aspiration.
-In MICU, required IV fluids and neosynephrine.  CVP 10-14.
Received solumedrol in ED.  Initially, started broad spectrum
vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and flagyl.  Urine, blood, and stool
cultures negative.  Patient came from nursing home where large
outbreak of [**Location (un) **] virus.
-Speech and swallow performed video swallowing study, as concern
for aspiration pneumonia.  Patient will need to continue on
pureed solids and thick liquids to prevent aspiration.
-Will be discharged on levofloxacin for four more days for COPD
exacerbation.
.
2)Respiratory Distress:
Hypercarbic and hypoxemic repsiratory failure most likely
secondary to COPD flare. Previous ABGs revealed carbon dioxide
retention. Cardiac ECHO on [**4-29**] revealed elevated right atrial
pressure and dilated right ventricle, consistent with pulmonary
hypertension.  Placed on bi-pap initially, but on discharge
tolerating 2L nasal canula.  At baseline, patient requires
supplemental oxygen.
-Patient to continue on levofloxacin and prednisone, as
respiratory distress most consistent with COPD exacerbation.
Will continue prednisone for four more days.  40mg for the next
two days and then 20mg for the following two days.  Patient will
also complete four more days of levofloxacin.
-Patient will be dis
