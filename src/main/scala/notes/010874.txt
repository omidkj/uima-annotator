Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, fever, chills

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
85yo M w/ CAD s/p CABG and RCA stents, AS, COPD on home O2 and
NSCLC was admitted to cardiology [**Date range (1) 18727**] (AM of admission).
Details of admission not available as DC summary not yet
started, but initial CMI note documents cath performed to
evaluate for possible AVR for AS.  Cath report shows diagnostic
cath [**2-4**] with 3VD, patent grafts as below, LVEDP of 27, and
15mm Hg gradient across the aortic valve (calculated valve area
.9cm2).  The patient had three bare metal stents placed to his
RCA.
.
His family notes that he had increasing DOE prior to admission
to the point that he could not walk across his room on the day
of discharge.  Two hours after arriving home, he spiked a fever
to 102.  This was associated with chest tightness, SOB,
diaphoresis, nausea and increased work of breathing.  His
neighbor, a pediatrician, brought over a sat machine which read
63% and so 911 was called.  ED VS: 98.7  105  166/94  25  70%3L.
 Patient placed on BIPAP and given vanco, levaquin, aspirin,
ntg, ntg gtt, soludemdrol 125mg, albuterol neb, lasix 50mg.  ED
discussed case with cardiology fellow who requested admission to
MICU.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2154-2-9**] 4:44 PM
.
There are extensive coronary artery and aortic calcifications.
Patient is status post CABG. The central airways are patent to
the segmental levels bilaterally.
There are pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymphatic nodes,
including right paratracheal and left paratracheal, that are not
overtly changed from previous examination by size criteria.
There has been interval increase in soft tissue surrounding
CyberKnife marker, now measuring 19 mm versus 9 mm previously,
suggestive of progression of the disease. Again noted is
interstitial fibrosing pattern associated with ground-glass
opacities, affecting predominantly right lung in peripheral
distribution. This is more prominent compared to previous
examinations, and may represent interstitial fibrosing process
versus radiation pneumonitis. Imaged portion of the liver is
unremarkable. There are several gallstones in the gallbladder,
without evidence of acute cholecystitis. There is a cyst arising
from the upper pole of the right kidney. There is a
hypoattenuating lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney,
likely representing angiomyolipoma. There are extensive vascular
calcifications.

BONE WINDOWS: Demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic
lesions.

IMPRESSION:

1. Interval increase in size of soft tissue surrounding
CyberKnife marker, worrisome for progression of the disease.

2. More prominent appearance of right lung interstitial
fibrosing pattern that may represent interstitial fibrosing
process versus radiation pneumonitis. There is no evidence of
edema.
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2154-2-6**]
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. No atrial  septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left  ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion  are normal. The aortic root is moderately
dilated athe sinus level. The  ascending aorta is moderately
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are  moderately thickened.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area  0.8-1.19cm2) Mild
to moderate ([**1-8**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.  The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid  regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic  hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate, calcific aortic stenosis. LVH. Normal
LVEF.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a charming 85 year old gentleman with CAD s/p CABG,
COPD on home O2, and NSCLC who was admitted for elective heart
catheterization, found to have patent grafts, AS, and elevated
LVEDP. He received three bare metal stents to his RCA and was
discharged home. He returned the same evening of discharge with
fever, chest tightness, SOB, and hypoxia. He was brought to the
MICU and diuresed, placed on antibiotics, and transferred to the
cardiology-medicine service the following day. He was diuresed,
underwent multiple consultations by cardiology, pulmonary, and
Heme-onc. He was discharged to home with VNA with potential
bridge to hospice pending follow up appt in the
multidisciplinary lung cancer clinic.

1) Hypoxia
On admission CXR, patient appeared to be volume overloaded;
given lasix in ED and his hypoxia improved with continued
diuresis.  Elevated LVEDP in cath lab the day prior supports
this diagnosis (although could be [**2-8**] pulm htn and AS) and
patient received 2L IVF in the prior two days for
catheterization. Of note the patient has severe COPD at baseline
with 2L resting and 4-5L ambulatory O2 requirement. Serial ABG's
on transfer to the floor revealed well compensated chronic
respiratory alkalosis with marked A-a gradient with pO2 in the
50's.
- Pulmonary consultation was obtained and formulated a likely
multifactorial etiology, but could not rule out radiation
pneumonitis s/p XRT and possibley cardiac catheterization as a
possible etiology. Aspiration pneumonitis surrounding cardiac
cath was also considered
- Lasix diuresis improved oxygenzation
- Prednisone was started, but later discontinued per pulmonary
given lack of clear benefit in pneumonitis and possibility that
it may worsen pt's fluid balance.
- Levo/Flagyl for aspiration PNA.
- BiPAP at night improved oxygenation.
.
2) Fever-
Blood, urine, sputum cultures were unrevealing. CXR without
evidence of focal consolidation, but given evidence for Lung CA
progression. Patient was treated with Levofloxacin/Flagyl for
possible aspiration vs. post-obstructive pneumonia.
.
3) [**Name (NI) **]
Pt was s/p stent to RCA the evening of re-admission. Despite
evidence for AS by valve area, the gradient across the valve was
not considered significant in impairing the pt's hemodynamics.
- Pt was continued on ASA, Plavix
- He wa
