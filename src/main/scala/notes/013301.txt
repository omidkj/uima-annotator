Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3256**]
Chief Complaint:
multifocal pneumonia

Reason for MICU transfer:  hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tunneled dialysis catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 72 year old female with h/o COPD, CKD, HTN, DM, gout
now transferred here with pneumonia. The patient presented to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] with shortness of breath and cough since Tues . Patient
feels generally fatigued. Patient saw her PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 5929**] who gave
her a Z-Pak. Patient denies any chest pain. She also notes URI
symptoms.  She felt worse and felt dizzy so she went to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**].  In [**Location (un) 620**] ED, initial VS were HR: 108 BP: 77/51. Labs
were notable for WBC 13.7 (88% neut and no bands), Hct 27.6
(baseline in low 30s), lactate 0.8.  Cr was elev at 6.9
(baseline 3.1).  TnT was 0.057.  Hypotension was thought to be
due to sepsis as well as dehydration. Pt was given
Ceftriaxone/Levoquin.  Patient was not responding after 5 L of
fluid. A right subclavian was placed. Pt then suddenly had an
episode of atrial tachycardia that was wide complex. Central
line was backed up from its original marking at 20 to 16. Neo
was given, however, the patient still hypotensive. Levophed was
subsequently added.  Pt rec'd a total of 9L IVF there.  Pt was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as there are no ICU beds at [**Location (un) 620**].
.
In the ED here, initial VS were: 98.2 108 105/62 18 97% 3L.
Vanc was added to her abx regimen.  Pt was then admitted to ICU
for further management.  On transfer, VS were Temp: 97.9 ??????F
(36.6 ??????C), Pulse: 104, RR: 20, BP: 132/70, O2Sat: 94%, O2Flow:
2L.
.
On arrival to the MICU, pt is lying comfortably in bed.  States
she feels fatigued.  States breathing is comfortable. Endorses
productive cough.  Denies chest pain.

   Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2132-6-6**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other
L.
      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species.
Furthermore, in
      infected patients the excretion of antigen in urine may
vary.

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2132-6-7**]
10:36 AM
FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the prior study from [**2132-6-7**].
There is a right-sided central venous catheter whose distal lead
tip is at the cavoatrial junction, appropriately sited.  There
is mild cardiomegaly.  There is some prominence of pulmonary
interstitial markings suggestive of mild fluid overload.  Small
bilateral pleural effusions are present.

Radiology Report ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY) Study Date of
[**2132-6-7**] 12:52 PM
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of hydronephrosis.
2.  Gallbladder is surgically absent.  CBD measures 10 mm, which
may reflect
post-surgical changes.  No obstructing CBD stone is seen.

[**2132-6-7**] 7:07 PM
FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from [**2132-6-7**],
10:47 a.m.
There is a right IJ central venous line which has been placed
and the distal tip is in the superior SVC.  There is a right
subclavian catheter with the distal lead tip in the distal SVC.
Heart size is upper limits of normal but stable.  There is
persistent moderate pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions
and left retrocardiac opacity.
