History of Present Illness:
83M w/ h/o CAD s/p remote silent MI and PCI in '[**95**] in [**State 2690**],
reported CHF, PE in [**1-14**] on anticoagulation/ivc filter now
admitted to MICU for further management of resp failure after
transfer from OSH for evaluation of gas in region of
gallbladder.

Records are limited but apparently recently d/c'd from OSH for
treatment of recurrent PNA (for which completing course of abx)
when apparently felt presyncopal/?fall w/o loc/head trauma when
walking in bathroom. Later, began to note increased doe, pnd,
orthopnea w/ le edema. No definite wg or cp. Chronic cough
productive of reddish sputum. Evaluated at OSH where noted to be
hypoxic on 4 liters but o/w hemodymically stable. Labs notable
for flat ck and troponins, bnp of 877 and no definite
leukocytosis. CXR w/ reported bilateral patchy consolidation and
pleural effusions confirmed by CT w/o evidence of thromboembolic
disorder. Films thought to be worse than prior CXR c/w pna. CT
also noted incidental gas in region of gallbladder fossa. Pt
diuresed nearly 2.5 liters w/ minimal improvement in oxygen
requirements so transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for furhter evaluation.

At [**Hospital1 18**], remained afebrile, marginal pressures and CXR w/
bilateral patchy alveolar infiltrates. Labs notable for troponin
of 0.18 and BNP in xcess of 7K. ECG w/ LBBB. Developed increased
tachypnea in the setting of tachycardia and relative htn w/ abg
7.29/52/105. Received 120IV lasix, nitro gtt but ulitmately
placed on BIPAP. Received ceftriaxone and zithro. LFT wnl and
u/s negative for abscess in the biliary tract.

Radiology:
[**3-27**] Liver U/S IMPRESSION:

3. No evidence of focal hepatic mass or intra- or extrahepatic

[**3-26**] CXR
1. Acute pulmonary edema. Its somewhat atypical appearance
suggests the possibility of underlying emphysema.

[**3-27**] Chest CTA
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Moderate layering bilateral pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis with bilateral patchy areas of ground-glass opacity
as well as areas of interlobular septal thickening consistent
with pulmonary edema/volume overload. In addition, there are
multiple bilateral patchy areas of consolidation involving all
lobes of the lungs worrisome for superimposed infectious
process.
3. Extensive atherosclerosis including atherosclerosis of the
coronary arteries.

[**2101-3-28**] ECHO:

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with severe regional systolic dysfunction
including akinesis of the inferior wall and basal half of the
anterior septum and anterior walls. The remaining segments are
hypokinetic. The basal inferolateral wall contracts best. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. E/e' is >15
c/w elevated LVEDP. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened but no aortic stenosis is present. Mild
(1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-10**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild  pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: left ventricular cavity enlargement with severe
regional
dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD (or other diffuse process).
Increased LVEDP. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 y/o M w/ CAD, CHF, DM, recurrent PNA admitted to ICU with
hypoxic respiratory failure. Brief hospital course outlined
below.
.
The patient was admitted to the ICU and intubated for hypoxic
respiratory failure. The cause of his hypoxia was felt to be
largely secondary to CHF exacerbation with volume overload.
There was also a suspected component of aspiration pneumonia
with thick purulent secretions noted by endotracheal suctioning.
For his volume overload, he was diuresed aggressively with IV
lasix, which he tolerated well. For his pneumonia, he was
treated broadly with vancomycin, ceftaz, flagyl with gradual
improvement of his oxygen requirement and reduction of
secretions. He will complete his antibiotic course on [**2101-4-8**].
He was weaned of ventilatory support by [**2101-4-4**] and was quickly
weaned down to nasal cannula with maintenance of oxygen
saturation >97%.
.
Given his history of PE, he was continued on heparin IV
anti-coagulation and transitioned to coumadin on [**2101-4-5**].
.
In order to evaluate his cardiac function, an ECHO was performed
which confirmed systolic heart failure with an EF of 20-25% in
the setting of 2+ MR. [**Name14 (STitle) **] was maintained on a medical
regimen of b-blocker, ace-I, digoxin and daily lasix (see
medication list for discharge doses)
.
Of note, initial imaging studies revealed evidence of gas in
gall bladder wall. However repeat imaging did not confirm this
finding and liver function tests remained stable throughout. No
further evaluation was performed on this hospitalization.
