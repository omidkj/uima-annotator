.
Chest X-ray, PA/Lat: In comparison with study of [**2191-9-21**], there
is increasing enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
engorgement of ill-defined pulmonary vessels, consistent with
the clinical impression of congestive failure. However, the
relative [**Name (NI) 95365**] between the heart size and pulmonary
vascularity raises the possibility of underlying cardiomyopathy
or pericardial effusion.
.
Carotid U/S: There is minimal scattered areas of mild
homogeneous wall
thickening. The peak systolic velocities bilaterally are normal,
however, as are the ICA/CCA ratios. There is also normal
antegrade flow involving both vertebral arteries.
.
Post-Bypass:
1. The patient is on an infusion of NTG, and is AV paced.
2. There is a prosthetic mitral valve in place and well-seated..
No leak. Small, expected jets within the valve.
3. TR is now trivial.
4. Preserved biventricular systolic fxn.
5. Aorta is intact. No AI.
6. Other parameters are as pre-bypass.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Cardiology service summary: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 68yo female with
recently diagnosed severe mitral regurgitation and hypertension
who presented with worsening dyspnea on exertion c/w CHF
exacerbation.  She had been started on Lasix ~3 weeks prior to
admission at time of recent hospitalization however developed
worsening shortness of breath at home prompting readmission. She
was determined to be in acute decompensated heart failure and
was diuresed with bolus IV Lasix doses with improvement in her
symptoms. On hospital day #1 she was noted to have ~9 seconds of
asymptomatic wide complex polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.
EP service was consulted and felt that this episode was
consistent with Torsades. She also had bradycardia to 30-40's
alternating with tachyardia on telemetry felt to be tachy-brady
syndrome. She had a rate-related bundle branch block as well. EP
felt that patient required pacemaker placement prior to hospital
discharge. Given this development, CT surgery was consulted as
patient has known severe MR and was re-admitted within 1 month
period for second episode of CHF exacerbation likely related to
known valvular disease. CT surgery recommended mitral valve
replacement with tricuspid valve repair. She underwent pre-op
clearance including dental films and consult prior to surgery.

Underwent surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] on [**5-8**]. Transferred to the
CVICU in stable condition. Extubated on POD #1. EP consulted for
NSVT and prior prolonged QT/ Torsades. IV heparin started for
mechanical valve anticoagulation while pending pacer placement.
Underwent pacer placement [**5-14**] and transferred to the floor.
Keflex was given for prophylaxis regarding the pacemaker
inseertion.  Coumadin started. Chest tubes and pacing wires
removed per protocol.  The patient was discharged home on POD 10
with an INR 2.0.  By this time she was ambulating freely, the
wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral analgesics.
She was discharged home in good condition with VNA and
appropriate follow-up instructions.
