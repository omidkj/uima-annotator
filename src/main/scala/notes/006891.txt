History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 87 year old female who presented to [**Location (un) 620**]
this morning with complaint of dyspnea going on for several
days, gradual in onset.  She has a h/o critical AS, is being
considered for an aVR.  She presents with increasing shortness
of breath and generalized weakness. Additionally she had an
episode of vomiting last night. Does not know if she had any
hematemesis or coffee-ground emesis . She reports that she has
chronically black stools due to iron supplementation. Noted to
be hypoxic on arrival.  Her ROS at [**Location (un) 620**] was notably positive
for orthopnea, cough, N/V, dysuria, and negative for
chills/fever, abd pain, diarrhea.  CXR was thought to be
consistent with CHF.  Her Hct was found to be 22 down from a
previous value of 27, with guaiac positive stools, and INR found
to be 5.  She was given Vitamin K 10mg IV, 1 unit PRBCs, Lasix
10mg IV. Hct bumped to 30 after 1 unit PRBCs, and INR decreased
to 3.9 after vit K.  She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further management.

EKG: Rate: 63 bpm. Axis left axis deviationST/T
     Non-Specific ST changes Rhythm: paced

On arrival to our ED, initial VS were:  96.5 78 158/79 20 98% 6L
Nasal Cannula, she eventually required NRB and desatted when
weaning was attempted.  Protonix bolus + gtt was started; she
was type and crossed, given 2 units FFP, given Lasix 10mg IV.
EKG was noted as Vpaced rhythm.

GI consulted but have not seen her yet.

MICROBIOLOGY:
Blood culture [**7-24**]: negative
Blood culture [**7-25**]: negative
Urine legionella antigen [**7-24**]: negative
Urine culture [**7-24**]: negative

IMAGING:
CXR [**2171-7-24**]: Worsening right lower lobe pneumonia and mild
pulmonary edema

TTE [**2171-7-25**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
is critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2171-5-27**], the
velocities across the aortic valve have increased slightly. The
severity of aortic stenosis remains critical. The other findings
are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 year old female with critical AS presenting with
gradual-onset dyspnea and weakness, found to have anemia with
guaiac positive stools, as well as new hypoxia and leukocytosis
with likely pneumonia and acute congestive heart failure
exacerbation.

# Goals of Care: When the patient initially presented, she was
considered a candidate for possible percutaneous aortic valve
replacement (CORE valve).  However given her tenous fluid
status, refractory GI bleeding on anticoagulation and delerium,
she was no longer considered a candidate.  Several family
meetings were convened to assess her goals of therapy and care,
and it was decided by all including her son [**Name (NI) **] and daughter
[**Name (NI) **], and the care team that further interventions would NOT be
of benefit.  She was discharged to a skilled nursing facility
with the understanding that care will be aimed at maintaining
her comfort and with the expectation that her condition will
worsen in the near future and further hospitalization are not
indicated.  This was discussed with her h
