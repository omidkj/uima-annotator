Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the trauma ICU on ventilator. He was
intubated and eventually weaned off the ventilator by hospital
day . He was intermittently agitated in the ICU, breaking
through propofol and showing purposeful movements but not
obeying commands. He remained neurologically stable, and showed
some improvement. By Hospital day # 6 he was extubated, and able
to sit up in bed.

His course was complicated by MSSA bacteremia, Coag (-) staph
wound infection, oropharyngeal colonization with N.
Meningitidus. For these, he was treated with Levoquin IV, IV
oxacillin, and IV ceftriaxone. He was afebrile.

Upon transfer to the floor on HD#8, the patient showed waxing
and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, where he was occasionally able to
interact, follow commands, and answer questions, and at
othertime was basically nonresponsive. A thorough workup showed
no definite neurologic structural, metabolic, infectious or
toxic etiology for this. However, over the course of his
hospital stay, his mental status continued to improve. He was
soon able to tolerate po intake, and by discharge was eating a
full diet.
