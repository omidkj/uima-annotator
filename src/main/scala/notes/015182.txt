Attending:[**Male First Name (un) 4578**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cath

History of Present Illness:
77 y/o F PMH significant CAD s/p several stents, DM,
hyperlipidemia, HTN who presents with shortness of breath of 2
days duration. Patient reports difficulty breathing at rest and
with exertion. She denies any associated chest pain. She reports
baseline ankle edema. She denies orthopenia and PND. She denies
any chest pain or SOB since her cath in [**Month (only) **]. She denies
sick contacts, fevers, [**Name2 (NI) **], increased sputum production, sore
throat and muscle aches. She reports nausea and episode of soft
stool yesterday. She denies bloody or black stool.
.
Patient presented to [**Location (un) 620**] ED - reported to be hypoxic with
improvement on NC. Initial vitals T 100.3, Tm 100.8, P 107, RR
20, Bp 137/62, O2Sat 87% RA. Concern for PNA based on CXR and
given Ceftriaxone/Azithromycin. Per report no EKG changes and
given 4 baby aspirin. Troponin elevated 0.28 consequently
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. On arrival to
[**Location (un) 86**] [**Hospital1 18**] T 96.9, BP 124/63, HR 82, RR 18, 97% 4L. Patient
normotensive. O2 sat 97-98% 2-3L. Nitro drip started. Ordered
for 1 pRBC but not hung prior to transfer. Guaiac negative.
.
Patient had recent admission [**Date range (1) **] for NSTEMI s/p DES to
LM, LAD and RCA during the course of two catheterizations.
Metoprolol and Norvasc increased, Hydralazine started. Patient
transfused 2 units for angioseal bleed. CT scan ruled out RP
bleed. Acute on chronic renal failure - felt to be related to
contrast load in cath and required ultrafiltration in CCU.

CXR on admission:
1) Persistent loculated left effusion with increasing fluid
within the left pleural cavity and new partial left lower lobe
atelectasis.
2) New mild pulmonary edema.
3) New small right pleural effusion.
.
ECHO [**2173-3-25**]: Normal left ventricular cavity size and wall
thickness with preserved global and regional biventricular
systolic function. Elevated left ventricular filling pressures.
Mild aortic stenosis with mild aortic regurgitation. Mild to
moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Very small to small anterior
pericardial effusion.
.
CARDIAC CATH [**2173-3-26**] (PRELIMINARY REPORT): Coronary
Angiography- Right domimant LMCA- Stent widely patent. Because
of the proximal mild lucency, it was interrogated with pressure
wire that showed FFR of 0.92 indicative of no significant
disease.
LAD- Patent mid LAD stent with 30% ISR, no other significant
disease
LCX- Small vessel with no significant disease
RCA- All stents are widely patent. Mild mid PDA disease.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Widely patent stents in LMCA, LAD and RCA
2. Mildly elevated LVEDP
3. Minimal aortic valve gradient
.
CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST [**2173-3-27**]:
The trachea and central airways are patent to the subsegmental
level. There is mild senile calcification of the
tracheobronchial tree. The aorta and great vessels are normal in
caliber and contour, though dense calcification of the aorta, as
well as dense calcification of the right and left coronary
arteries, is noted. The heart is normal in size. There is a
small pericardial effusion. There is no mediastinal or hilar
adenopathy identified. The esophagus appears normal.
Calcification of the aortic valve is also noted. There are small
bilateral pleural effusions, though the effusion on the right
has slightly increased compared to [**2172-11-18**]. This is simple
fluid in attenuation. On the left, the amount of pleural fluid
is likely unchanged, also simple fluid in attenuation. There is
a focal higher-density region at the periphery of the lingula
and left lower lobe, which might represent rounded atelectasis,
which appears slightly larger than on the prior study.
Within the lungs, there is a small calcified granuloma seen at
the left base (2:25). There are no additional pulmonary nodules
or masses identified. Apical pleural scarring is seen
bilaterally. In the visualized upper abdomen, visualized liver,
spleen, and adrenal glands are normal. Hyperdense material in
the upper pole of the left renal collecting system likely
represents retained contrast from cardiac catheterization
performed one day prior.
BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes are noted in the thoracic
spine. No
suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral small simple pleural effusions, likely unchanged on
the left and slightly increased on the right.
2. Probable subpleural rounded atelectasis/collapse in the
lingula and left lower lobe, slightly worse in appearance since
the most recent comparison of [**2172-11-18**]. The oval
hyperdense mass previously seen in the pleural space anteriorly
adjacent to the lingula on [**2172-11-18**] might also represent
a focus of atelectasis/collapse. Recommend followup imaging
after resolution of pleural effusions to assess stability of
findings.
3. Dense aortic and coronary atherosclerotic calcification, with
additional calcification of the aortic valve.
4. Retained contrast within the renal collecting system
secondary to recent cardiac catheterization.
