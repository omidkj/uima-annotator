Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2181-10-15**] Aortic Valve Replacement (23mm CE Pericardial tissue
valve)

History of Present Illness:
75 yo F with severe AS, A. Fib, CAD, CHF, pulm hypertension
transferred from an OSH with SOB. The patient describes 3 weeks
of shortness of breath with minimal activity. She had a single
episode of CP approximately 2-3 weeks ago though since that time
has been CP free. She denies any episodes of syncope, N/V. She
notes increased lower extremity edema for 1 month, improved over
the last several days. She also notes a 4 lb weight gain at the
time of admission. The patient presented from home to OSH for
elective cardiac cath for evaluation of the shortness of breath.
Cath revealed severe AS (0.7cm2) with AI as well as very
elevated filling pressures RA 12-14mmHg, mean wedge of 30mmHg,
peak Ao gradient of 75-80mmHg, PA pressures 80-85mmHg,
significant MR and 30-40% ostial LM disease.
.
In the cath lab the patient was extremely hypertensive to 213/75
with associated desaturation to 89% on RA, 92% on 2L. She
received furosemide 40mg, nitroprusside and ativan with
improvement in systolic pressures and improved O2sat to 95% on
RA. She was transferred for CT surgery evaluation and management
of possible CHF.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical quality, a
focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. No
resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). No
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Physiologic MR (within normal
limits).

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild to moderate [[**12-5**]+] TR. Normal PA systolic
pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Moderate pericardial effusion. Effusion echo dense,
c/w blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. Effusion is
loculated. No echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal
views. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results were
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A well-seated
aortic bioprosthesis is seen with thin/mobile leaflets. The
gradient was not assessed. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is top normal. There is a
moderate sized, partially echofilled pericardial effusion most
prominent lateral to the left ventricle and extending around the
apex. Minimal effusion is present anterior to the right
ventricle and right atrium. There are no echocardiographic signs
of tamponade.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 yo F with severe AS, A. Fib, CAD, CHF, and
pulmonary hypertension transferred from an OSH for evaluation of
aortic valve replacement. Upon admission she was appropriately
worked-up and medical management was optimized until surgery.
She was treated for UTI. Once patient was stable for surgery
([**10-15**]) she was brought to the operating room where she
underwent an aortic valve replacement. Please see operative
report for surgical details. Following surgery she was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. She remained intubated until post-op day two due to
acidosis. She was eventually weaned from sedation on this day
and extubated without incidence. She was followed by
electrophysiology for junctional rhythm and initially requiring
temporary pacing. Also on post-op day two her chest tubes were
removed. Later on this day she was transferred to the telemetry
floor for further care. Her rhythm recovered and she was
restarted on coreg. Coumadin was restarted for a fib. She was
seen by renal for acute renal failure with creatinine to 3.1. On
