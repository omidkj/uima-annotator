CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
82-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease
on hemodialysis, last dialysis Friday, coronary artery
disease, CHF with an EF of 40%, presents with acute shortness
of breath with gradual onset.  The patient had gone out to
dinner and eaten a meal that was not consistent with her
usual low-salt diet and felt that she had an increase in
peripheral edema following her Friday hemodialysis.  She
experienced orthopnea without chest pain, lightheadedness, no
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, bright red blood
per rectum, or melena.

On arrival to the Emergency Room, the patient required mask
ventilation, pressor support of 5, PEEP 5, and FI02 of 50%.
Ultimately, the patient was placed on a nitroglycerin drip
and transitioned to 6 liters nasal cannula, saturating 97%.
The patient was transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring
of acute CHF exacerbation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  End-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis.
2.  Coronary artery disease, status post RCA stent in [**8-6**]
with thrombus, re-stent stenosis in [**10-6**] with NSTEMI.
3.  CHF with an ejection fraction of 40%, +1 MR.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Type 2 diabetes.
6.  Depression.
7.  Hyperlipidemia.
8.  History of TIA.
9.  Glaucoma.
10. Cataracts.
11. Peripheral vascular disease, status post bilateral
femoral-[**Doctor Last Name **] and left fem-tib bypass.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with husband.  [**Name (NI) **] very active
daughters in her health care and compliant with medication.
She attends dialysis t.i. week.  No tobacco.  Occasional
alcohol.  No IV drug use.  She is active at baseline.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  PhosLo 664 mg t.i. meals.
2.  Vitamin E.
3.  Vitamin C.

5.  Nephrocaps one tablet p.o. q.d.
6.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Mirapex 0.25 mg p.o. q.h.s.
8.  Pravachol 10 mg p.o. q.d.
9.  Quinine 650 mg p.o. q.h.d.

11. Atacand 4 mg p.o. for systolic BPs greater than 120.
12. Eyedrops.
13. NPH insulin 27 units q.a.m. half dose q.h.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  In the ED,
99.4, blood pressure 116/38, heart rate 75, breathing at a
rate of 19 at 100% on mask ventilation of 5 and 5.  General:
Uncomfortable on mask ventilation, in no acute distress.
HEENT:  The mucous membranes were dry.  JVP at 9 cm.  PERRLA.
EOMI.  Chest:  Crackles at the bases bilaterally.  Cardiac:
Regular rate, I/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left lower
sternal border.  Abdomen:  Soft, positive bowel sounds,
obese, nontender, nondistended, no organomegaly.
Extremities:  Warm, no DP but PT pulses bilaterally.  There
was 2+ pitting edema bilaterally.  Left upper extremity
fistula with bruit and thrill.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  On admission, white count 16.0,
hematocrit 37, platelets 470.  Chem-7 pertinent for potassium
5.4, BUN and creatinine 79 and 7.3 respectively.  Troponin
0.19.  CK 41.

Chest x-ray consistent with CHF, pulmonary edema,
consolidation at left lower base with bilateral small pleural
effusions.

The EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 91,
normal axis, normal intervals, Qs in III, T wave inversion in
III, hyperacute versus peaked T waves in precordial leads, ST
depression, 1 mm in V5 and V6, and I which were new.

IMPRESSION:  The patient was admitted to the MICU with a
history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis and anuric
who presents with shortness of breath.  Given the patient's
prior significant coronary artery disease, continued on
aspirin and Plavix and monitored with serial enzymes to rule
out an ST elevation MI given positive troponins.  The concern
was cardiac etiology for her CHF exacerbation rather than
dietary indiscretions.

The patient was dialyzed on hospital day number one with
resolution of her shortness of breath, continued to monitor
troponins which reached a peak of 0.2.  Given her prior
cardiac history, a TIMIV was obtained which revealed new
inferior reversible defect.  The decision was made to take
the patient the patient the Catheterization Laboratory where
there was a discreet 80% lesion in the OM2 with a
Taxol-eluding stent placed and a discreet 90% lesion in the
RCA with balloon angioplasty and brachytherapy to the area.
The patient postoperatively day number one and two did well
without chest pain or evidence of significant volume
overload.  The patient was continued on lifelong aspirin and
Plavix and will increase the patient's Zocor from 5 mg p.o.
q.d. to 20 mg p.o. q.d.  LFTs were obtained in-house which
were normal.  The cholesterol panel revealed a cholesterol of
129, LDL 65, HDL 33, and triglycerides of 135.  At the time
of discharge, CKs were flat and troponins trending down.

END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE:  The patient remained on t.i. week
hemodialysis with strict weight monitoring.  In discussion
with the Renal Team, it was felt that the patient's dry
weight goal could be decreased and to be further monitored as
an outpatient, hemodialysis continued, calcium acetate and
Nephrocaps as well as strict fluid and sodium restrictions.

HYPERTENSION:  The patient continued on beta blocker, Toprol
XL, as well as ACE as managed as an outpatient.

GLAUCOMA AND CATARACTS:  The patient continued with current
ocular medications.  No acute changes.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to home with VNA
care per prior to hospitalization.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  There are no medication changes with
the exception of an increase in the patient's Zocor to 20 mg
p.o. q.d.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with PCP in one to
two weeks as well as Cardiology in one to two weeks to assess
for weight, volume status, to continue on outpatient
hemodialysis t.i. week.
