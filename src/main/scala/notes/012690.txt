HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, the patient is a
57-year-old white male with a history of known coronary
artery disease, status post a non Q-wave myocardial
infarction in [**2092-10-12**] with a cardiac catheterization
at that time revealing 60% LAD stenosis, 60% OM2 stenosis and
60% RCA stenosis.  The patient does not have any recent
complaints of chest pain, but does have episodes of weakness
associated with his Celebrex use.  He was found to have
hypertension and primary care physician referred patient for
echocardiogram which showed a normal ejection fraction with
moderate mitral regurgitation.  This was followed by a stress
test which was positive and the patient was again referred
for cardiac catheterization which revealed 60% proximal RCA
diffuse disease of the right PDA, 30% of the left main, 50%
of the mid LAD, 100% of the circumflex with severe mitral
regurgitation and an ejection fraction of approximately 55%.
Thus, the patient was referred to the [**Hospital1 **]
to cardiac surgery and coronary artery revascularization and
mitral valve replacement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension
2.  Hypercholesterolemia
3.  Non Q-wave myocardial infarction

9.  Benign prostatic hyperplasia

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Parotid gland cyst removal
2.  Right ankle surgery

HOME MEDICATIONS:

2.  Zestril
3.  Atenolol
4.  Celexa
5.  Sulfasalazine
6.  Aspirin
7.  Glucosamine

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  The patient was afebrile with stable vital
signs.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm and no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Thus, the patient was admitted
postoperatively on [**2102-7-3**] after undergoing coronary artery
bypass graft x3 and mitral valve replacement with a #31 St.
Jude's valve.  He received a left internal mammary artery to
the LAD, saphenous vein graft to the OM and saphenous vein
graft to the PDA.  The patient tolerated the procedure well
without any complications and was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.

On postoperative day #1, he was noted to still be requiring
Neo-Synephrine for blood pressure support, although this was
gradually weaned off during the course of the day.  He was
transferred to the floor on postoperative day #2 in stable
condition.  The patient remained afebrile with stable vital
signs.  Physical therapy was consulted and the patient was
noted to be doing adequately well with anticipation of being
able to obtain a level 5 physical therapy status.

Currently, the patient is on postoperative day #3.  He is
continued on Coumadin for his mitral valve anticoagulation
and his INR today on postoperative day #3 was 2.4.  He
remains afebrile with stable vital signs and is walking a
level [**1-15**].  The patient is expected to be discharged on
postoperative day #4 after working with PT and obtaining a
level 5 status.
