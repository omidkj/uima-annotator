Labs on Discharge:

Imaging:
Head CT [**2-12**]:
FINDINGS: There is a hypodensity centered within the left
temporal lobe (2,
13) measuring 1.5 x 2.0 cm consistent with acute
intraparenchymal hemorrhage. This hemorrhage appears to extend
into the left basal ganglia. There is minimal surrounding edema
identified. Small amount of hemorrhage is seen in the posterior
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricle. There is no evidence of
hydrocephalus. The basilar cisterns are patent. There is no
evidence of shift of normally midline structures. There is
hyperostosis frontalis. The visualized paranasal sinuses are
clear. Mild soft tissue prominence over the right posterior
vertex is noted.
IMPRESSION: Acute hemorrhage centered within the left temporal
lobe extending into the left basal ganglia. A small amount of
hemorrhage within the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral
ventricle. No evidence of herniation or hydrocephalus.

Head CT [**2-13**]:
FINDINGS: Again seen is a rounded focal high attenuation lesion
centered in the left temporal lobe (series 2, image 11),
measuring 16 x 19 mm previously 17 x 20 mm, essentially
unchanged. There is minimal surrounding edema and no shift of
normally midline structures. There is persistent and unchanged
layering of a small amount of blood within the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of
the left lateral ventricle. The lateral ventricles are similar
configuration as before with no evidence of hydrocephalus. Basal

cisterns are intact. Again noted is hyperostosis frontalis
interna. The
mastoid air cells are clear. Visualized paranasal sinuses clear.

IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of left temporal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage
with associated small layering within the posterior of the left
lateral
ventricle.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 62F with PMH of afib, TIA, Dementia secondary to
Anoxic brain injury during diabetic coma, LBP, anemia, GERD,
COPD who was in her baseline state of health until a fall 5 days
ago.  Gradually became confused and began having more trouble
producing meaningful speech over the last 5 days.  Has confusion
at baseline recognizing husband, but not oriented otherwise. Had
2.1 cm left temporal hemorrhage at OSH and given 10mg IV Vit K
and 1u FFP and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for definitive care.

Upon admission she was transferred to the ICU for close
monitoring. Neurologically she was unchanged and subsequent head
scan revealed stable intracranial hemorrhage. Given the
spontaneity of the bleed (atraumatic), an MRI is desired to
evaluate for possible underlying pathology. Unfortunately, due
to the patient's torso girth, this was not able to be performed
during her acute hospitalization. It was therefore determined
that this could be completed as an outpatient within two weeks,
and prior to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

Of significance, during the patient's ICU hospitalization, she
began to have sinus pauses of [**1-18**] seconds. Cardiology was
consulted, and they believe that the labetalol that she had been
receiving, or potentially dilantin may have contributed to these
events. She was therefore stopped on the labetalol, and changed
to Keppra.  She was also started on acebutelol; which has
seeming resolved her arrhythmia. Cardiology did however
recommend that the dose NOT be adjusted, as at higher doses
could induce similar effects as the labetalol.

On [**2-15**], she was determined to be stable enough; both
neurologically and cardiovascularly, to transfer her from the
ICU to neuro stepdown.  She was seen and evaluated by PT/OT who
she needed rehab facility.  On [**2-17**] in good condition for d/c
