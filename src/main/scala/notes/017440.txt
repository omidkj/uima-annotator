Brief Hospital Course:
86 yo F w/o close medical care, w/ no known medical hx.
transferred from OSH with SOB, NSTEMI, undocumented a.fib, CHF,
then complicated by PNA and septic shock with prolonged
intubation and altered mental status.
.
# NSTEMI: Patient noted to have +CE at osh, Troponin peaked at
1.99, here Troponin T 0.17. ECG with LBBB and no old ECGs. TTE
showed EF 25% with focal wall motion abnormality. Pt was treated
with ASA 325mg qdaily, Statin and Lopressor 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **], however
then she developed cardiogenic shock and was treated with
Dobutamine. Echocardiogram without baseline for comparison
showed severely depressed ejection fraction of 25% with basal
inferoseptal akinesis. Repeat echocardiogram seven days later
showed essentially similar EF. She was placed on high dose
statin, metoprolol, captopril then lisinopril afterwards.
.
# SEPSIS/SHOCK/PNA: After recovery of cardiogenic shock, the
patient went on toward a more distributative picture, and was
placed on norepinephrine for vasopressor support. She had RLL
