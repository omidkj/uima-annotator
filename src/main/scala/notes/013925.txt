Physical Exam:
Vitals:T 96.2, BP 143/75, HR 98, RR 30, O2 sat 98% on BIPAP set
at 10/8 with 80% oxygen.
General: obese female with face mask for BIPAP in place.
HEENT: anicteric sclera, MMM, PERRL, plethoric neck, unable to
assess JVD given body habitus
CV: RRR nl S1 S2, no m/r/g but distant heart sounds
LUNGS: diffusely rhonchorous, crackles half way up bilateral
lung fields R>L
ABDOMEN: +BS, obese, soft NTND, no HSM appreciated
EXT: 1+ edema bilateral LE

Pertinent Results:
[**2168-3-16**] CXR: There is consolidation/atelectasis in the left lower
lobe. Interval decrease in size of left pleural effusions, which
is small. There is no evidence of CHF. The lungs are better
aerated especially in the upper lobes. Cardiac contour is
obscured by the left consolidation and pleural effusion.
Mediastinal wires are intact. Right internal jugular catheter
with tip in right atrium, unchanged from prior study. There is
no pneumothorax.
[**2168-3-3**] Echo: POST CPB: Normal RV systolic function. Left
ventricular views are very limited. Can not rule out a focal
wall motion abnormality. Limited transgastric views suggest an
EF around 40%. A bioprosthesis is noted in the mitral position.
It is well seated with normal leaflet function. There is trace
valvular MR with a MVA of 2 cm2. No other changes from pre CPB.

[**2168-2-23**] Cardiac Cath: 1.  Selective coronary angiography in this
right dominant patient revealed three vessel native coronary
artery disease. The LMCA was angiographically normal.  The LCX
was mid occluded with faint collaterals to an OM from the LAD.
The LAD had a proximal 80% lesion, diffuse mid disease to 80-90%
involving a large diagonal which had an origin 70% lesion.  The
RCA was totally occluded proximally with robust left to right
collaterals from the LAD to PDA. 2.  Limited hemodynamics
revealed low systemic blood pressure at 83/49 with mild
pulmonary diastolic hypertension at 21mmHG. 3.  Due to severity
of CAD with mitral regurgitation, intubated status with recent
ultrafiltration and clinical picture consistent with cardiogenic
shock and intra aortic balloon pump (Arrow 30cc) was placed.
[**2-24**] CNIS/Vein Mapping: 1. Patent bilateral greater saphenous
veins, that on the right below the knee was not assessed due to
an overlying boot. 2. Limited carotid study demonstrating
patency of the left ICA and CCA only. The right system could not
be assessed due to a central line.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo F with known CAD and reversible inferolateral defect, CRI
with Cr baseline 2-2.5, and DM who has been having increasing
angina and evidence of NSTEMI at OSH last week. This was
medically managed and now she returns with decompensated left
ventricular systolic heart failure. She was treated with
ceftriaxone, azithromycin &, flagyl for question of pneumonia.
She was changed to vancomycine and meropenum per infectius
diseases after having fevers. She remained intubated on CVVH on
multiple pressors until she was taken to the operating room on
[**2168-3-3**] where she underwent a CABG x 3/MVR ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 7163**] [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9041**] Porcine Valve). She was transferred to the ICU in
critical but stable condition on milrinone, levophed, propofol,
and insulin. She continued on CVVH, remained intubated for
respiratory failure and question of ARDS, continued on
vancomycin and meropenum for sepsis of unclear etiology, and
remained on her vasoactive drips. She was transfused multiple
times, her HCT was followed closesly and she was started on a
PPI for coffee ground appearing NGT output. On POD #4 her
milrinone was weaned to off. She was started on tube feeds. The
remainder of her drips were weaned to off by POD #5. She was
seen by general surgery for HD access placement. She was
extubated that on POD #6. She was seen by speech and swallow
several times who ultimately recommended thin  liquids, soft
solids and supervised feeds and aspiration precautions. CVVH was
stopped on POD #8, diuresis was unsuccessful with lasix and she
was started on HD. She was transferred to the floor on POD #11.
She continued to do well from a surgical perspective, finished
her antibiotics but was deconditioned and was ready for rehab on
POD #14. She was dialyzed in the morning on [**2168-3-17**].
