History of Present Illness:
MR. [**Name14 (STitle) 80462**] is an 87 yo male admitted to [**Location (un) 5871**] on [**7-23**] for
severe pneumonia. He was sent home on antiobitics but
re-presented five days later with increasing SOB, productive
cough, and confusion. At that time, he underwent bronchoscopy
which showed LLL secretions and TBM. He was transfered to [**Hospital1 112**]
for stent was placed by thoracic surgery. He was then discharged
to rehab on vancomycin/cipro. He developed acute respiratory
failure at rehab on day 10 of antibiotic courserequiring
intubation prior to EMT arrival. Initial ABG noted to be
7.10/101/103/31. She was then trasnfered to [**Hospital1 80463**].
.
At [**Hospital6 **], he was remained intubated for
approximately one day and initially required levophed to
maintain BP. Sputum cultures on admission were positive for
MRSA, so he was treated with Vanco/Zosyn/Levo. He was hydrated
with fluids and his pre-renal ARF resolved. He was extubated
prior to [**8-26**]. He was tolerating bipap for 2 days but required
re-intubation today for unclear reasons. He was found to have a
new LLL pneumonia. He underwent another bronch on [**8-28**], where
his stent was found to have migrated distally. He was started on
levophed drip.
.
An echo on [**8-27**] showed elevated PA pressures ( 49-54) though
unchanged from previous echo). PA pressure on [**8-16**] was noted to
be 52.1. He was started empirically on heparin on [**8-27**] but this
was held prior to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] at 11:30 Am for unclear
reasons. Of note, patient failed bedside swallow eval on [**8-26**].
.
He is being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for stent removal and Y-stent
placement following recovery of pneumonia.

Admission CXR: AP semi-upright frontal chest radiograph is
compared to four hours prior. There is no marked interval change
aside from improved technique which better delineates the
inferior margin of the tracheal stent to lie within the carina.
Lines and tubes are in standard fashion and unchanged. There is
mild pulmonary overload and a moderate left effusion. There is
scattered atelectasis.
IMPRESSION:
1. No marked interval change in mild pulmonary overload and
moderate left
effusion.
2. Suboptimal tracheal stent position.
.
CXR [**9-16**] - Right upper lobe and bibasilar opacities have
worsened partially due to increased atelectatic component.
Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is unchanged. Small right pleural effusion is stable.
Left lateral CP angle was not included on the film.
