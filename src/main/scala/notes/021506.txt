Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2234**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
56 yo female with history of schizoaffective disorder was
admitted from the ED with respiratory distress. She was
intubated upon arrival and no family/friends were available for
obtaining further history. History was obtained primarily from
chart review and ED records.
.
Of note, patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] psychiatry from
[**Date range (1) 102314**] with the auditory hallucinations and paranoia.
During her admission, she was noted to refuse her outpatient
medications intermittenly and had elevated blood pressure at
these times.
.
Upon admission, patient had respiratory distress with
hypertension. Her vital signs were HR 120, BP 280/140, RR 40,
and 94% on NRB (60% on RA). She was intubated shortly after
admission to the ED, and right femoral line was placed due to
inability to obtain peripheral IVs.  Patient received
nitroglycerin .4mg SL x 1, ativan 2mg IV x 2, lasix 40mg IV x 1,
propofol sedation, levofloxacin 750mg IV x 1, ceftriaxone g x 1,
aspirin 600mg x 1, and tylenol 650mg PR x 1.

Pertinent Results:
[**2118-3-16**] CTA chest
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Bilateral tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] infiltrates that could be infectious
(for example atypical mycobacterial infection) or inflammatory
in etiology (infectious bronchiolitis).
3. Additional bilateral, peripheral, pleural-based
consolidations differential diagnosis for which includes
infection as well as chronic processes such as primary atypical
pneumonia, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia or cryptogenic
organizing pneumonia.

[**2118-3-17**] renal ultrasound
FINDINGS: Incredibly limited study due to portable nature,
patient inability to cooperate, and technical limitations of the
ICU space with multiple other machines. There is no evidence of
hydronephrosis. The bladder was not visualized. A Foley catheter
was noted to be in place.
.
[**2118-3-17**] ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. A small secundum atrial septal
defect is present. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen
on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild to moderate ([**12-22**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2113-11-20**], the severity of mitral regurgitation
and tricuspid regurgitation has increased. A small secundum ASD
is now identified. No vegetation is identified, but aortic valve
images were suboptimal. If clinically indicated, a TEE is
recommended to assess endocarditis.
.
[**2118-3-24**] ECHO repeat (To assess MR while on nitro drip)
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2117-3-16**], the findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
53 yo female with history of schizoaffective disorder was
admitted from the ED with likely hypoxic respiratory failure of
unclear etiology and in the setting of hypertensive urgency.

[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course by problem:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated when
she arrived to the [**Last Name (LF) 153**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] her differential was broad. She was
intially started on broad coverage antibiotics to cover
bacterial etiologies -- vanc, cefepime and azithromycin. The
vancomycin was discontinued after 2 days, and azithro was
completed for a 5 day. course. Her cultures remained negative.
DFA for flu was negative. urine legionalla negative. On her 7th
day of her hospitilzation, she spiked fever to 101. She was on
cefepime at the time, so vancomycin was started. for 48 hours,
she remained afebrile and cultures were negative, so vanc was
discontinued and cefepime was also discontinued (For a total of
9day course). Her vent settings were weaned, but she when
sedation was weaned, she was agitiated and hypertensive. The
hypertension was correlated with reduced PEEPs. The reduced peep
likely exacerbated her known mitral regurgitation. To optimize
her for extubation, she was started on a nitro drip. Her blood
pressure was controlled on this, and she was able to be
extubated without hemodynamic instablilty.
For sedation, she was intially on propfol, which was switched to
fentanyl and midazolam. When these were weaned off to put her on
pressure support, she was very agitated and required 5mg haldol
TID with 2.5-5mg PRNs. She also recieved several day of 10mg
valium TID as well. This controlled her enough for extubation.
.
2. Hypertension
Unclear etiology for patient's hypertensive urgency upon arrival
to the ED given inability to take any history. Differential
includes medication noncompliance, pain.
the patient was inreasingly hypertensive and she was started on
captopril and isosorbide mononitrate. It was then realized that
her a line pressure was higher then normal because of flicking
of the tip. She had urine metanephrines sent as part of work up
for secondary causes of HTN. As above, she was put on a
nitrodrip for preload reduction periextubation, as increased
preload with reduced PEEP exacerbated her MR. When the nitrodrip
was discontinued, she was started on 20 mg TID of isordil. and
continued on captopril 50mg TID.
