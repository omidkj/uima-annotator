RADIOLOGY:  KUB showed a 15 cm cecum with a stricture outline
with barium in the sigmoid colon.

Department the patient's vital signs temperature maximum and
temperature current was 97.4.  Pulse 60.  Blood pressure
154/80.  Respirations 24.  Satting 94 percent on 3 liters.
In general, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is described as a moderately obese
Caucasion woman in some distress.  She is alert and oriented
times three.  HEENT examination shows pupils are equal, round
and reactive to light.  Sclera nonicteric.  Cranial nerves II
through XII are grossly intact.  There is no evidence of
anterior or posterior lymph node change.  ____________ noted,
likewise noted it to be nontender.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  There is some evidence of an
expiratory wheeze.  Cardiac examination shows regular rate
and rhythm.  Abdomen is moderately distended and quite
tympanitic.  There are high pitched bowel sounds.  There is
some tenderness, however, there are no specific peritoneal
signs, psoas signs, obturator signs.

CLINICAL COURSE:  Based on her presentation, clinical history
and radiographic findings a diagnosis of large bowel
obstruction was given to the patient. She was taken to the
Operating Room on the day of her admission.  Operative
findings showed massive distention of colon, gangrenous
patches in the left cecum and transverse colon.  Also of note
there are areas of impacted stool.  Surgical repair was by
subtotal colectomy with ileosigmoid anastomosis.  The
procedure was said to have gone without complications.  She
was kept intubated and transferred to the Surgical Intensive
Care Unit.  On postoperative day number two the patient was
extubated without any complications.  Clinical examination
remained unremarkable.  On postoperative day three the
patient was transferred to the normal surgical floor.  She
had a central line, which was kept in place given that we
were unable to obtain prophylaxis.  Postoperative days three
through six the patient did quite well overall.  There was a
fine balance in maintaining her fluid status given her
compromised pulmonary function.  So long as she continued on
her intravenous steroids, however, pulmonary status appeared
to be okay.  By postoperative day seven the patient was found
to have had considerable deconditioning and was unable to
ambulate without assistance. Physical therapy consultation
confirmed that she would need to have some period of
rehabilitation following discharge.  By postoperative day six
there had still been poor return of bowel function.  The
patient had not had a bowel movement, nor which she
tolerating any diet.  At that time the decision was made to
start the patient on total parenteral nutrition.

Over the next 11 hospital days there were several starts and
stops with trying to advance the patient's diet.  Her bowel
function remained very slow to resume no doubt contributed to
by the size of her colon.  Ultimately she was placed on a
standing regimen of mineral oil and glycerine suppositories
and then started having regular bowel movements.  By
postoperative day 13 she was tolerating clears. Her diet was
gradually advanced, her total parenteral nutrition weaned and
her staples removed.  On [**2143-5-30**] after final evaluation by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and the rest of the Surgical Service it was
deemed that the patient was an appropriate candidate for
discharge.  Physical therapy reconsult at that time confirmed
that the patient would need and still need considerable rehab
and that there had been some deconditioning during her
hospital stay.  Pulmonary status had been stable on her
intravenous Solu-Medrol and it was felt that this could best
be weaned at the rehab facility.

DISPOSITION:  The patient is discharged to acute rehab.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Chronic constipation.

Status post subtotal colectomy for large bowel obstruction.

Possible [**Last Name (un) 3696**] syndrome.
