IMPRESSION:
1. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation.
2. Small amount of free perihepatic fluid.
3. Collapsed gallbladder with wall edema and small amount of
pericholecystic
fluid. These findings could be due to a variery of chronic
conditions
including hypoalbuminemia, chf, or can be seen in hepatitis.
There is no
evidence to suggest acute inflammation.
.
CXR: [**2114-12-18**]
Very severe heterogeneous opacification has developed in the
left upper lobe.  Left lower lobe was collapsed in [**Month (only) 1096**], now
reexpanded and densely consolidated. There may be left hilar
adenopathy and small left pleural effusion. Overall, findings
are consistent with extensive pneumonia though under the
appropriate clinical circumstances, this could be infiltrated
malignancy. Small region of ground-glass opacity in the right
apex persists since the chest CT done on [**2114-1-13**].
Mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly is longstanding and right lung
shows some mild vascular redistribution but I do not believe
pulmonary edema is playing any role.
.
-[**2114-12-21**] TTE: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thicknessis is normal. There is normal cavity
size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%). The
estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Doppler
parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left
ventricular diastolic dysfunction. The right ventricular cavity
is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

-[**2114-12-24**] CT chest:
1. Multifocal pneumonia, comparable in extent to the appearance
on the chest radiograph, [**12-23**], which has progressed since
[**12-18**]. Small bilateral pleural effusions are also
comparable and not of sufficient size to suggest empyema. There
are no characteristics of the widespread pulmonary infection, to
permit discriminating among possible causes: virus, bacteria, or
fungus.
2. Minimal increase in size and number of mediastinal lymph
nodes, presumably reactive. More substantial left hilar
adenopathy cannot be excluded, but if present, is not
obstructive, and is equally likely to be reactive.
3. New tiny right middle lobe lung nodule.
4. Small pleural and pericardial effusions could be sympathetic
to infection, or residual from prior cardiogenic edema

-[**2114-12-27**] CT head
No acute intracranial hemorrhage. No acute intracranial process

-[**2114-12-30**] MRI/MRA
Multiple areas of restricted diffusion are seen in both cerebral
hemispheres involving frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. No
focal acute infarcts are seen within the posterior fossa. The
distribution is in the watershed region in the left frontal
lobe, but otherwise, it is in the cortical and subcortical
region of both cerebral hemispheres. There is no acute
hemorrhage identified. There is no mass effect, midline shift or
hydrocephalus. Mild-to-moderate brain atrophy is seen.
IMPRESSION:
1. Multiple small acute cortical and subcortical infarcts
including infarct in the left frontal watershed distribution as
described above. Mild diffuse decreased signal within the bony
structures of the head could be due to marrow hyperplasia or
infiltration and clinical correlation recommended.
MRA OF THE NECK: Neck MRA shows normal flow in carotid and
vertebral arteries without stenosis or occlusion.
  IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the neck.
MRA HEAD: Head MRA demonstrates normal flow in the arteries of
anterior and posterior circulation.
  IMPRESSION: Normal MRA of the head

-[**2115-1-1**] TTE Bubble Study: No atrial septal defect or patent
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
