History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 year old female with past medical history of
multiple MDR infections/sepsis in multiple sources (VRE, ESBL,
C. glabrata and parapsilosis in urine, blood, joints),
metatstatic ovarian cancer with liver mets s/p XRT and chemo c/b
radiation-induced enteritis and multiple admissions for SBOs as
well as chemotherapy-associated cardiomyopathy (EF of 50% in
[**11-4**]), presents from her rehabilitation center with increased
confusion and hypertensive urgency (BPs 200s/100s).  She suffers
from chronic abdominal pain and was given Dilaudid before
becoming somnolent. She was given Narcan 0.4 mg x 2 and
lopressor 5mg x 1 at the rehab and slightly improved.  The
patient recently finished a course of Linezolid at the rehab on
[**11-23**] for VRE.
.
In the ED, her initial VS were P 68, BP 192/116, R 12, O2 100%.
She was put on a nitro gtt briefly, with a rapid response of her
BP to 127/74 with a HR of 74. EKG showed NSR, ST dep v3-v5, I.
She was given Narcan 2 mg x 1 with minimal improvement in mental
status. Imaging - CT head was negative, KUB showed dilated loops
of bowel and SBO could not be excluded, but her abdominal pain
improved as she woke up more.
.
The patient was initially admitted to the floor and quickly
transferred to the MICU for an acute worsening of her mental
status and BP of 70/dopplerable.  In the MICU, the patient
became progressively oliguric, but renal U/S was negative.  Her
blood pressure responded well to fluids and she became
hypertensive, prompting administration of labetalol and
hydralazine for better control with return of urine output, but
transient bradycardia.  Further work-up of her hypotension
included a CXR showing multifocal opacities and CT scan with ?
consolidation.  Her urine culture grew E.coli once again and she
was started on linezolid and meropenem for suspected ESBL
organisms.  She has not had any respiratory issues.  Her Hct has
been dropping (13 pts in total from admission), stool guaiac
neg.  CT abdomen did not show an RP bleed.  She is s/p 1 unit
yesterday and Hct is at baseline in mid 20s and now stable.  She
has never been febrile and her mental status has remained
stable.
.
Upon transfer to the floor, vitals are 97.1, 159/76, 84, 19 and
100%RA.  She continues to have diffuse abdominal pain and is
experiencing increased RUE swelling, so much so that she cannot
wear her watch anymore.  She reports watery diarrhea, worse over
the last 4 days than her chronic diarrhea, as well as 4 days of
burning/frequency on urination.  She is alert and oriented, but
tearful about her illnesses.  She has lost 60 lbs over the last
2 years due to her chronic diarrhea.
