Brief Hospital Course:
Patient underwent CT scan, which was consistent with a
mesenteric mass near the cecum. Proceeded with exploratory
laparotomy with planned wedge resection of mesenteric mass
requiring right colectomy on [**3-26**]. She underwent right colectomy
for obstructing ascending colon from an isolated giant
diverticula. The patient at
operation noted to have a markedly inflamed gallbladder,
pathology consistent with chronic cholecystitis and open
cholecystectomy was performed at that time. Postoperatively the
patient was evaluated for tachycardia and underwent a CAT
scan which was suggestive of a right upper quadrant fluid
collection. HIDA scan revealed a leak which was confirmed by
ERCP. Endoscopic biliary stents were placed for better drainage
of a duct of Luschka leak from the hepatic fossa. It was
recommended in consultation with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] to
proceed with a percutaneous drainage of fluid collection by
interventional radiology on [**4-1**]. Postoperative hematocrit
showed a change from 33 to 22. The patient was tachycardiac,
transfused two units of blood and returned to the operating room
for exploration on [**4-2**]. Patient was kept in the ICU intubated.
Patient was extubated on [**4-5**]. She was subsequently transferred
out of the unit. Patient was deemed stable and suitable for
discharge on [**4-8**]. JP x 2 were removed on discharge.
