History of Present Illness:
78y/o F h/o diabetes, chronic back pain, recurrent SBO requiring
multiple surgeries who presents to the ED with hypotension after
reported fall. Admitted to ICU for monitoring of hypotension.
Pt was seen recently in the ED [**5-30**] for left wrist pain and
itching after splinted [**5-27**] from fall-related ulnar and distal
radius fractures. She had been feeling alright at home but today
felt fatigue, nausea, diffuse body aches and joint aches, with
subjective fevers at home. She had some mild headache but no
altered mental status/confusion or neck stiffness to suggest
meningitis. Patient may have had another fall last night.

ED course:
V/s: 97.6 109 127/74 20 95% on 2L NC. Developed fever to 102
(oral).
Pt was noted to have a nonproductive cough.
Interventions:
Pt was given morphine at 10:30 AM for total body aches. Also
given CTX, azithro, nebs for possible PNA and 2L IVF. Pt then
triggered for hypotension to 85 systolic from previous pressures
in 150s, moved from the periphery to the core and given an
additional 2L IVF NS along with vancomycin. Pt received 125mg
methylpred for wheezing. Flu swab sent. After total 4L sbp in
low-mid 90s.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt noted to be extremely somnolent which
had not been noted before. Could barely whisper her first name
and only opened her eyes for several seconds in response to
sternal rub and voice commands. Pt received 0.4mg narcan and
immediately became more alert, crying out that she was cold and
that her back was cold. Denied pain. Would not answer any
history questions other than , did not know the year. did know
that she was in the hospital and that it was [**Hospital3 **]. Pt was
also administered another liter of NS.
.
Spoke with Pts son who states that she has become increasingly
depressed although fully functional still at home. In the last
year bought a cemetery plot and whenever something happens to
her for example her recent wrist fracture she goes and visits
the plot.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 y/o F h/o DM, multiple abdominal surgeries for SBOs, OA,
falls, presents with hypotension and fever, admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for hypotension, found to have altered mental status.

#AMS - on arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] noted to be lethargic not
responding well to commands, oriented only to name.  Mental
status improved with one dose of narcan, making medication
effect likely source of AMS as patient had received morphine in
ED, in addition to home morphine/oxycodone.  In addition,
patient had received medications during her observation stay in
the Emergency Room just a day prior to this admission.  She
insists that her chronic pain medications were not the cause of
her change in mental status and her hypotension, but rather that
the additional medications she received in the ED during her
observation stay were culprit.  SHe insisted on being very
responsible regarding her medications.  As medications have worn
off, patient is now awake and alert.  Head CT negative for
subdural in the setting of fall.  Patient was febrile in the ED,
but is now hemodynamically stable without other fevers and CXR
negative for pneumonia, making infection unlikely source of AMS.
   Patient remained lucid for the remainder of the admission,
and was seen to be extremely anxious to go home.

#hypotension: Patient with hypotension to SBP 80s in the ED
(baseline SBP 110-160). BP now stable in 120??????s since admission
to the ICU.  Given blood pressure normalized following clearance
of opioids, likely opioid-induced.  No further evidence of
infection to support sepsis as etiology.  Troponin x 2 negative
for evidence of cardiac ischemia.    Systolic blood pressures
started to rise to 150 at the time of discharge so patient was
instructed to continue all of her home antihypertensives.

#h/o asthma
- pt was reportedly wheezy in ED. s/p 125mg solumedrol. Lungs
clear for the remainder of the admission.

#h/o anxiety - holding home diazepam in setting of AMS, but
patient was clearly anxious to be discharged from the hospital,
and insisted on repeating every detail of her history.

#h/o left wrist fracture - on long acting morphine and oxycodone
at home. in setting of AMS and lethargy/unresponsiveness, these
medications were initially held.  However, these are patient's
long standing medications, so she will continue to use them, as
they have not caused lethargy or change in mental status in the
past.  Vitamin D level ordered and is pending at time of
discharge.

#chronic back pain- patient to resume home medications on
discharge
