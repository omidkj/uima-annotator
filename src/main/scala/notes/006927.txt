Mrs. [**Known lastname 67434**] is an 83 yo woman with HTN and recent diagnosis
of metastatic colon cancer, s/p C1D1 FOLFOX [**11-12**] who was
referred to the ED today because of loose black stools. Since
starting chemotherapy, she reports having diarrhea approx 4-5x
daily, +nausea and anorexia, with poor po intake. Denies
diarrhea prior to starting chemotherapy. She reports LUQ

baseline). Given the complaint of pleuritic chest pain and SOB,
CXR was done and unremarkable, and subsequent CTA showed a R
superior subsegmental PE. She was felt to be dehydrated with
initial HR sinus rhythm in the 140s, and received IVFs,
potassium repletion with improvement in rate to low 100s. She
received levo/flagyl for diarrhea. CT Head was performed prior
to starting a heparin drip and showed no obvious brain mets.

evidence of mass effect or midline shift. Please note MRI is

.
[**2153-11-21**] CT chest, abd, pelvis w/o contrast: 1. Thrombus in the
right subsegmental branch of the superior branch of the right
pulmonary artery. No other areas of pulmonary emboli noted.
2. Multiple hepatic metastases, unchanged from prior
examination.
3. Bilateral renal cystic structures are unchanged.
4. Metastatic collision tumor adjacent to the right adrenal
gland, unchanged.
5. Sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis. Mucosal
thickening in the cecum adjacent to the ileocecal valve
consistent with patient's known
diagnosis of colonic mass.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo F with recent dx of metastatic colon cancer s/p C1D1
FOLFOX chemotherapy [**11-12**] who presents with diarrhea, SOB, sinus
tachycardia and found to have R superior segmental PE.
.
# Pulmonary embolism: Subsegmental on CTA. Pt denies h/o DVT or
clotting hx, likely hypercoag. state secondary to malignancy. No
evidence of R heart strain on EKG. Sinus tach may be related to
PE or dehydration. Unclear from hx if this was an acute event or
incidental finding on presentation. No O2 requirement while in
ICU. Started heparin gtt, was transitioned to lovenox after
transfer out of the ICU. She was started on coumadin 2mg daily.
On discharge the INR was 1.1 and she was given a Rx for coumadin
2mg daily and lovenox for 5 days. She is to have your blood
drawn at home on [**11-30**] for an INR check to be faxed to her PCP
and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Further adjustments to the coumadin may be
necessary at that time.
.
# Dehydration: Pt with diarrhea and poor po intake for several
days. Sinus tachycardia and borderline low uop. Patient was
given IVF and lytes were replete. She became euvolemic with
hydration and resolution of the diarrhea.
.
# Diarrhea: Nonbloody, guiac positive after several hours of
diarrhea (likely due to irritation). HCT stable. Most likely
trigger is chemotherapy with FOLFOX. No fevers. C diff negative
x 3. Stool culture negative. Patient given loperamide and
lomotil, required rectal tube. Diarrhea gradually stopped and
her electrolytes stabilized.  Further chemotherapy should be
carefully chosen in the setting of severe diarrhea caused by
FOLFOX. Patient should continue a lactose free diet. She should
also continue to avoid fresh fruits. Discharged on loperamide
prn.
.
# Colon cancer: Metastatic to liver, adrenal. Defer treatment to
primary oncology team. No chemotherapy while in the hospital
given her acute illness.
.
# Hypertension: SBP 140s-160s, stabilized on metoprolol and
nifedipine. Transtitioned back to atenolol and nifedipine on
discharge
.
# GERD: continued home PPI, increased dose to [**Hospital1 **] for worsening
symptoms.
.
#Hypercholesterolemia: Stain held as liver enzymes (AST, alk
phos) showed a slight increase during the ICU stay. The statin
was restarted upon discharge.
.
# Code: DNR/DNI - confirmed with pt.
