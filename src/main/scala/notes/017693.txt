Brief Hospital Course:
61 y/o F with PMH of neurofibromatosis, COPD on 2L home O2,
adrenal insufficiency [**12-18**] chronic steroid use, presented from
[**Hospital 4199**] hospital with altered mental status, fevers and
increased oxygen requirement.
.
Urinary Tract Infection: Patient completed a course of meropenem
(10 days ending [**7-25**]) for a citrobacter & ECOLI UTI.  Her foley
catheter was removed.
.
Pneumonia: CXR findings suggestive of left lower lobe
consolidation with mild alveolar edema and small left pleural
effusion; however these findings appear only marginally changed
from prior. Received IV vancomycin, levaquin, and meropenem
empirically (patient is allergic to penecillins). IV vancomycin
and levaquin were discontinued ([**7-19**]) when CXR findings resolved
with diuresis.
.
Metabolic encephalopathy: Likely related to infection, uremia,
hypercalcemia. OSH CT head was negative. LP showed 2 WBCs only,
so not likely CNS source.   Tox screen was negative. Electrolyte
abnormalities were corrected. infection was treated with
antibiotics. Her mental status improved during the course of the
admission. On discharge the pt was alert, oriented to name and
date.
.
Acute Kidney Injury: Likely related to sepsis and decompensated
heart failure. Her renal function improved with IVF initially
when septic and later diuresis.
.
Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: on [**7-17**] she
decompensated with IVF given for [**Last Name (un) **], but responded to lasix.
Most of her cardiac meds had been held in the ICU and were
restarted on [**7-17**]. Since then her heart failure symptoms have
improved.  She returned to her baseline home oxygen
requirements. TTE demonstrated a globally depressed LVEF
consistent with cardiomyopathy of sepsis (discussed with
interpreting cardiologist, multivessel CAD also a possibility,
but felt to be less likely given clinical scenario).
.
COPD/adrenal insufficiency: Her last outpatient PFTs on [**2172-5-5**]
indicate moderate to severe COPD. Given COPD, recent steroid
taper, patient received hydrocortisone 100mg IV in the ED. She
was changed to PO prednisone 60 mg on [**7-17**], then slowly weaned to
20mg on [
