History of Present Illness:
This is a 72-year-old female with a history of non-small cell
lung cancer (diagnosed in [**2178**]), non-massive hemoptysis (s/p
right fifth posterior intercostal artery embolization on
[**2191-1-12**]), and recent admission for weakness ([**2191-1-14**] to
[**2191-1-18**]).  She presents from home today following dyspnea at
home.  Patient reportedly had been found to be confused at home
with with O2Sat 50% on room air, which then came up to 99% on
NRB. In the field, intial BP was 80/palp, so patient received
200 mL NS enroute to the ED. [**Name (NI) **] son is concerned that
patient's new medication, levothyroxine, is the reason for
presentation since the patient became acutely ill 2 hours
following the first time she took the medicine the morning prior
to presentation. Patient was reportedly doing well and had
breakfast without difficulty, though after taking her medication
with Ensure was found to have white frothy secretions.

109/60, RR 16, O2Sat 75% RA. Patient was given levofloxacin and
Zosyn. Family refusing translator in the ED. Patient is DNI,
though family was not ready to have CMO discussion according to
ED resident. Prior to transfer to the unit, vitals were: T 99.9,

[**2191-1-21**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Increased airspace consolidation overlying the left
lower lung
zone. Likely pneumonia or aspiration. Otherwise stable
appearance with stents overlying the right mid lung zone and
near entire collapse of the right hemithorax from known squamous
cell malignancy.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 72-year-old female with a history of non-small cell
lung cancer (diagnosed in [**2178**]), non-massive hemoptysis (s/p
right fifth posterior intercostal artery embolization on
[**2191-1-12**]), and recent admission for weakness ([**2191-1-14**] to
[**2191-1-18**]).
.
#. Hypoxia:  Most likely related to new LLL infiltrate on chest
xray, though other possibilities include aspiration event or
health-care associated/community acquired PNA.  As such, Ms.
[**Known lastname **] was covered broadly with vancomycin/zosyn/levofloxacin.
She was also treated for influenza with oseltamivir given her
poor pulmonary reserve.  A DFA for flu and urine legionella
antigen were sent.  However, despite the antibiotics and IVF,
Ms. [**Known lastname **] continued to be hypoxic.  She was given maximal 02 with
venti mask, but still had increased work of breathing.  After
long discussions with family, it was decided to make patient
DNR/DNI and not place invasive central venous catheters for
pressure support.  Throughout the night on [**1-23**] patient had
increasingly labored breathing and the family was called to the
bedside.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] eventually passed surrounded by family.
.
#. Hypotension: This was concerning for sepsis, even though Ms.
[**Known lastname **] was initially fluid responsive.  She was continued on
fluids (as her 02 sats tolerated) and antibiotics.  Moreover,
she developed a pronounced cardiac arrhythmia toward the end of
her life, which also contributed to her poor cardiac output.
.
#. Urinary tract infection:  UTI on admission might also be
contributing to septic picture and altered mental status.
Again, antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Zosyn, Levofloxacin.
.
#. Somnolence:  Multifactorial, with etiologies including
sepsis, hypotension, hypoxia, and hypercarbia.  An ABG in ED
showed respiratory acidosis at 7.30/59/215.  Patient was
ventilated maximally with venti mask, though no invasive
ventilation pursued as above.
.
#. NSCLC: Patient has survived well beyond the documented
expectations of her physicians. Most recently has had course
complicated by non-massive hemoptysis s/p embolization. She has
been on home hospice for approximately a year.  Family
understood gravity of the situation and Ms. [**Known lastname 68912**] strength thus
far, but still hoped for a miracle.
