Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7055**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catherization with drug eluting stent to left anterior
descending artery.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known firstname 2251**] [**Known lastname 33754**] is a 60 yo male with CAD, HTN, borderline DM
who recently underwent a cardiac cath with a stent LAD that did
not fully deploy who presents with CP that began at noon today.
The patient was shoveling snow at a moderate pace when he
developed the chest pain. CP became very severe and  was similar
to CP (SSCP with radiation to right shoulder) with his previous
MI so he presented to the ED.  He reports diaphoresis, but he
denies associated nausea, vomiting, SOB, palpitations or
dizziness.

He has been experiencing DOE regularly for the past year or so.
Patient presented in [**9-21**] with complaints of excertional chest
pain similar to his chest pain prior to his MI in [**2181**].  He was
seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5076**] in clinic and underwent cardiac cath on
[**2185-9-29**] that showed a totally occluded LAD and 80%. The LAD was
a very small vessel, and was crossed and stented.  In the
proximal portion of the stent, there was substantial rigidity of
the LAD and it would not fully dilate.   This resulted in a
40-50% residual stenosis but normal flow into the distal vessel.
 He continued to have excertional SOB and discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 5076**] CABG vs PCI and returned on [**2185-10-27**] with stent placement
to the OM1 lesion.

Today, he was found to have acute stent thrombosis in LAD stent
with hyper-acute T waves in the anterior leads.  In the ED, He
was started on heparin and given 4mg IV morphine. Potassium was
6.8, but hemolyzed. He was taken to the cath lab where the clot
was extracted with an aspiration catheter.  A balloon was used
first, but arotational atherectomy was required followed by
recurrent ballooning.  At the end of the case TIMI 3 flow was
restored an the patient did not have any residual stenosis.

On arrival to floor, he reports some mild nausea and SOB.  He is
not in any distress.  He denies chest pain or pressure.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
All of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
[**2185-10-28**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

CARDIAC CATH:
[**2185-12-21**]:
LMCA: Normal
LAD: acute stent thrombosis in mid LAD
LCX: widely patent stend in OMB.  Minor lumen irregularities in
LCX
RCA: not injected.

CXR: [**2185-12-21**]: Mild interstitial pulmonary edema. Linear opacity
projecting over the region of the proximal SVC and left
brachiocephalic vein which may be artifactual versus retained
catheter, not seen in the prior CT study (CT [**2183-5-13**]).
Clinical correlation advised and repeat imaging as warranted.

2D-Echo: [**2185-12-22**]
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with near
akinesis of the distal segments and apex and hypokinesis of the
mid septum and mid anterior wall. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate focal LV systolic dysfunction, consistent
with CAD (LAD territory). No significant valvular abnormality
seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known firstname 2251**] is a 60 yo gentleman with pre-diabetes, HTN, and CAD
who presents with chest pain and was found to have an acute
stent thrombosis.

1. CORONARIES:  Patient presented with stent thrombosis in LAD
stent that was not full expanded.  Treated with arotational
atherectomy followed by recurrent ballooning with restoration of
TIMI 3 flow.   CK and CKMB peaked at 5122 and > 500
respectively.  Patient was given 1L NS for renal protection post
catheterization and had no evidence of acute kidney injury
through duration hospital stay.  Tolerated procedure well, with
no complications.  He was continued on his ACS medications: ASA
325, metoprolol, lisinopril, atorvastatin. Plavix was
discontinued and he was bolused 60mg of prasugrel and started on
a regimen of 10mg daily given history of instent restenosis.
Also started on omepr
