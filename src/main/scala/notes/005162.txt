History of Present Illness:
This is a 65 yo f with a PMH significant for COPD (last FEV1 in
[**10-20**] 0.31 L; followed by pulm at [**Hospital1 18**]), morbid obesity, OSA
(on nightly BiPAP), HTN and GERD with a recent admission for
acute respiratory distress attributed to COPD, who presents
today after becoming acutely dyspneic at home without benefit
from her bronchodilators. She called EMS, who documented O2 sats
in the 80's. They placed her on a NRB and she subsequently
became lethargic. The NRB was removed and in the ED, she was
placed on NIPPV, with good result, sats came up to mid-90's and
MS improved. Vitals in the ED: T 97.5, HR 80, BP 152/74 RR 30,
sats 97% on CPAP. She was given nebulizers, 1 dose of solumedrol
IV, 1 dose each of CTX and azithromycin and was sent to the MICU
for further management. CXR was interpreted in the ED as low
lung volumes.
.
ROS: The patient denies chest pain, cough, fevers/chills, n/v/d,
recent illnesses or sick contacts. She notes that she feels much
better on the NIPPV than she did this morning. She is slightly
confused and doesn't remember the events leading up to her
admission. She had to be oriented to place and time. Last
admission for COPD exacerbation was [**10-20**].

CXR: Portable film showing bibasilar haziness obscuring the
diaphrams bilaterally. Evidence of cephalization and perihilar
fluffy infiltrates suggestive of pulmonary edema. Consolidation
in  the  lower  lobes  is  difficult to entirely excluded. No
large effusion  is  evident; however, small effusions cannot be
excluded. There is  no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette remains stable in  size, with a markedly enlarged
heart.


Brief Hospital Course:
Summary: 65 yo F with severe COPD and history of multiple
admissions for acute respiratory distress attributed to COPD
flares, admitted to ICU for management of acute respiratory
distress.
.
1. COPD exacerbation:  Patient improved greatly on NIPPV [**10-18**] in
the MICU.  She was initially treated steroids but this was
discontinued as she improved quickly.  She was also placed on
standing albuterol nebulizers.  She was transferred to the wards
the next hospital day.  Her SOB resolved by discharge.
.
2. Community-acquired pneumonia:  Pt had a mild leukocytosis on
admission.  CXR could not entirely exclude consolidation in the
lower lobes.  She was started on ceftriaxone, which was
transitioned to cefpodoxime, and azithromycin x 5 days.
.
3. Acute on chronic diastolic dysfunction:  Pt was noted to have
pulmonary edema on CXR.  She was diuresed in the MICU and her
home dose of furosemide was increased to 40 mg daily.
.
4. OSA: Patient's obesity is likely the major contributing
factor to OSA. Her BiPap regimen was increased to PS 14, PEEP
10.
.
5. Hyperlipidemia:  Pt was continued on home atorvastatin.
.
6. HTN: Pt's BP was controlled on home regimen of amlodipine,
hydralazine, and lisinopril.
.
7. DM: Pt was placed on humalog ISS during hospitalization.
.
8. Schizophrenia/Depression: Pt was continued on home Fluoxetine
and risperadone.
