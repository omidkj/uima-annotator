Brief Hospital Course:
57 yo F with a past medical history of Stage III Squamous cell
lung cancer, COPD on 3L oxygen at baseline, and anxiety presents
from the Chest disease center with hypoxia and tachycardia
following bronchoscopy. She was admitted to the MICU on [**2119-2-22**]
and discharged to home from the MICU on [**2119-2-23**] after her
condition improved. Her brief hospital course was notable for:

# Hypoxia: Baseline O2 requirement 3 L, and patient now titrated
down to 4L and saturating in the mid 90s. Unclear precipitant in
bronch suite. CXR does not appear fluid overloaded, or with new
infectious process. Likely due to a mixture of tumor and
extensive emphysema. Was recently started on augmentin as
outpatient for presumed post obstructive pneumonia. Currently
Afebrile. Does report cough, but at baseline. Continued on
outpatient course of augmentin. Blood cultures no growth at time
of discharge.

# Tachycardia: Now resolved to baseline. According to clinic
notes, appears HR as outpatient 10Os to 110s. On CCB at
baseline. Continued on verapamil.

# Squamous cell lung cancer: Stage III, likely recurrence after
chemo/rads last year. Per discussion with IP will defer repeat
bronch for now. Discharged to home with plans for follow up with
pulmonology.

# Anxiety: Continued Buspar. Ativan x 1 now
.
All other chronic medical issues for this Pt were stable. No
further changes were made to her outpatient medication regimen
other than those described above. She was discharged to home on
[**2119-2-23**] in good condition, with stable vital signs, and with
appropriate outpatient follow-up arranged.
