[**Last Name (STitle) 35700**]ese findings, he was sent for evaluation by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] who deemed the patient an appropriate candidate for
aortic valve replacement as well as resection of the
ascending aortic aneurysm and the non-coronary sinuses.  On
[**2197-10-16**], the patient was admitted to the hospital and went
to the Operating Room where he underwent an aortic valve
repair with a 27 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial tissue
valve.  Also had resection of an ascending aortic aneurysm
and of the non-coronary sinus.  A 26 mm tube graft was
accordingly placed.  Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was then attending
surgeon with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 21815**] being the assistant.  The
patient pericardium was left open with a right radial A line
and Right IJ Swan-Ganz catheter, two ventricular and two
atrial pacing wires.  There was mediastinal and right pleural
tubes that had been placed.  He was in sinus rhythm.  He came
off the pump without any difficulty.

Postoperatively he was rapidly extubated.  He did well from a
hemodynamic standpoint.  He had excellent blood pressure
control.  Strips were weaned the following day and started on
an oral regimen of Lopressor.  He was diuresed accordingly.
He otherwise is out of bed ambulating.  He was transferred to
the floor.  His wires were removed.  His Foley catheter had
been discontinued.  He is tolerating a diet ultimately by
postoperative day #3.  The patient passed a level 5
ambulatory status after having completed stairs without any
assistance.

The patient was eager to actually go home.  Given the fact
that he had done markedly well postoperative, his wounds
looked excellent, lungs were clear, lower extremities were
not edematous and the fact that he asked for analgesia and
was ambulating up stairs without difficulty, it was thought
that the patient was appropriate for discharge to home
without service.
