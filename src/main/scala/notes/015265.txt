Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is n 80-year-old woman with longstanding MVP and
moderate-to-severe MR who is recovering from multiple
hospitalizations, most recently due to severe congestive heart
failure in [**2152-11-26**]. Currently she admits to feeling stronger.
Her endurance remains poor, and she continues to experience
exertional dyspnea. Her appetite is good, and she is eating
three meals per day and two snacks. The head of her bed remains
elevated at all times to prevent aspiration.
** Per cardiology, she is unable to tolerate dabigatran, and she
cannot have a TEE because of her esophageal issues. She is on
Warfarin **. Given mitral and tricuspid regurgitation with
worsening PA pressures, she was admitted for cardiac cath today
and found to have clean coronaries. She will be placed on
heparin drip and await MVR on [**2153-3-19**].

[**2153-3-16**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this right
dominant system demonstrated no angiographically apparent
flow-limiting CAD although atherosclerosis was evident.  The
LMCA had an ostial 20% lesion.  The LAD had a ostial 25% lesion,
large D2 and distal vessel that wraps around the apex.  The LCX
had a 40% ostial stenosis and tortuous large OM3 and LPL.  The
RCA had a vertical origin, luminal irregularities to 30% in the
mid and distal section.  Tortuous RPDA, RPL1 and AM vessels were
noted as well as a modest caliber RPL2. 2. Resting hemodynamics
revealed elevated biventricular filling pressures with a mean
PCWP 35mm Hg and mean RVEDP 17mmHg at rest. Severe pulmonary
arterial hypertension with systolic, diastolic, and mean PA
pressures of 70/28/44mm Hg.  Prominent V waves consistent with
significant mitral regurgitation was also noted. Low cardiac
output cardiac index was reduced at 1.50 L/min/m2.  Entry PVR of
328 dyne-sec/cm5 and SVR of 3138 dyne-sec/cm5 was noted.

[**2153-3-19**] Echo: Unable to pass TEE probe. Resistance in upper
esophagous
Limited epicardial study
Prebypass: The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. LV systolic function appeaqrs to be moderately globally
depress (LVEF-35-40%)
Post Bypass: The patient is on epinephrine 0.05 uck/kg/min LV
function now appears normal in the setting of inotropes (LVEF~
55%) There are ring prosthese in the mitral and tricuspid
position. No residual MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] is visualized.

Final Report
INDICATION: 80-year-old woman, status post mitral and tricuspid
valve repair,
with now right-sided weakness and lethargy.

COMPARISON: None.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were acquired through the head without
intravenous
contrast.

FINDINGS: There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage,
edema, mass, or
mass effect. A new relatively well-defined hypodense region in
the medial
left frontal lobe, in the ACA territory, is consistent with an
acute
infarction. A tiny focus of hyperdensity in the parasagittal
frontal location
(2:8) may represent a focal "hyperdense ACA" with intramural
thrombus versus
plaque. No intracranial hemorrhage is detected. There is mild
mass effect on
the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the ipsilateral lateral ventricle. No
rightward shift of
midline structures is seen. The basal cisterns are normal. The
imaged
paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.

IMPRESSION: Acute left ACA territory infarct, with possible
focal
hyperdensity in the A2/A3 segment of the left ACA
