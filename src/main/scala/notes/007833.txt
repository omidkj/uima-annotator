History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 730**] [**Known lastname **] is an 83-year-old woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG in
[**2158**] (LIMA->LAD,SVG->OM1,SVG->D1,SVG->PDA) prior DESx2->SVG to
OM1, known occlusion of SVG->RCA, recent DES to SVG->D1 at OSH
and [**2185-4-20**] with repeat DES to D1, HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM2, who
was recently admitted with complaint of new chest pain [**4-19**] that
felt like normal angina but more intense.  Previously had angina
once monthly, but now more frequent. One day prior to admission
the pt had 3 episodes of SS CP with radiation to left arm, first
two were relieved with SL nitro, final episode was more intense
so the pt went to the ED.  During her admission, patient
underwent cardiac catheterization, with anatomy as described
below.  She had an uncomplicated stent placed to SVG to D1 for
70% in stent stenosis.  After the procedure she had two episodes
of chest pain that resolved with nitroglycerin.  She was then
discharged with increased dosing of Metoprolol.  That evening
the patient developed her typical sscp.  This resolved with SL
NTG, but then recurred.  Took another nitro with temporary
relief but when pain returned she presented to the ED.
.
Initial ED at 23:37 were 97.8, 62, 155/62, 18 and 97/RA.  ECG
showed inferolateral ST depressions that resolved with
resolution of patient's chest pain.  She was treated with
Nitroglycerin SL 0.4mg SL, ASA 325mg, Metoprolol 25mg, morphine
IV.  In the ED, patient developed respiratory distress in
setting of hypertension thought to be pulmonary edema.  She was
given Lasix IV and then started on a heparin gtt, nitroglycerin
gtt for treatment of pulmonary edema.  Patient was started on
CPAP for respiratory support.  .
On arrival to the ICU patient c/o 5/10 chest pain.  HR in 70's,
BP 120/70, RR 23, 93% on CPAP.

EKG SR 76 IVCD anterolateral 1-3 mm downsloping STD 1 mm STE aVR
1 mm STD II,F (changes improved on pain-free EKG)
.
Femoral Vascular U/S [**4-21**] -No evidence of pseudoaneurysm or
hematoma.
.
Chest X-ray ([**2185-4-22**]) - Increased interstitial opacities and
tiny pleural effusions consistent with mild volume overload,
stable cardiomegaly.  Lungs hyperinflated.
.
ECHO ([**2185-4-22**]): The left atrium is normal in size. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal and mid-inferior
hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
45-50%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Compared with the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2184-3-8**], inferior hypokinesis was present
on both studies, but is more pronounced now. Severity of mitral
regurgitation has increased. The other findings are similar.
.
Right Heart Catheterization: was performed by percutaneous entry
of the
right internal jugular vein, using a 7 French pulmonary wedge
pressure
catheter, advanced to the PCW position through an 8 French
introducing
sheath.
