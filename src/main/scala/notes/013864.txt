History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 50 yo F with PMHx significant for current tobacco
use, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, hx CVA [**2175**] who presented
to OSH this morning complaining of severe headache.  The patient
reports that the headache woke her from sleep at 1 am on the day
prior to presentation.  She describes it as bitemporal,
radiating to the back of her head, throbbing and associated with
nausea, sensitivity to light and sound. No aura, blurry vision
or other neurologic symptoms. She does have a history of
migraine headaches, for which she takes excedrine migraine once
every few months - describes this headache as significantly
different, and the "worst headache of her life."  She remained
at home for one day without any relief.  She also experienced
fever to 101 and shaking chills at home last night prior to
presentation at [**Hospital3 **], as well as right-sided
pleuritic chest pain.  She denies any SOB, cough, or sick
contacts.  On arrival to OSH, initial vitals were T 98.1, BP
113/71, HR 111, 96% on RA. She had CT head, which was
unremarkable, and LP which was normal.  CXR showed a RUL PNA and
she became progressively more hypotensive, with a nadir at 62/35
around 1300.  She received 3 L IVF, CTX 2 grams IV, azithromycin
500 mg PO, Morphine 4 mg IV x 2 , Dilaudid IV (total of 4 mg
IV), reglan 10 IV, and zofran  4 IV x2 and and BP improved to
90s/30s.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as there were no ICU beds
available at the OSH - en route she reportedly received another
1L NS (although not documented).
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.7 P 93 BP 78/p R 18 O2 sat 98%
on 4L NC, pain 4/10 intensity.  CXR showed a RUL pneumonia, labs
were significant for WBC 24 with a left shift (88% pmns, 5%
bands), Hct 34, lactate of 1.6.  She was given levofloxacin 750
mg IV, acetaminophin 1gm PO, toradol 30 mg IV and 500cc NS.
Blood and urine cultures were sent, and she was admitted to the
MICU service for further management.
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient reported improvement in her
headache, with intensity down to 5/10.  She denied SOB, chest
pain, cough, abd pain or other new complaints.  Did report
feeling thirsty and hungry.
.

CXR: [**2178-8-31**]:
FINDINGS: Portable AP upright view of the chest is obtained.
There is dense consolidation in the right upper lobe with air
bronchograms again noted, which could represent right upper lobe
pneumonia. Although, followup to resolution is advised as an
underlying malignancy cannot be excluded at this time. The left
lung remains clear. No pleural effusion is seen. Clips in the
upper abdomen are noted. Heart size remains normal.

IMPRESSION: Right upper lobe consolidation with air
bronchograms, most likely representing pneumonia, although
followup to resolution is advised to exclude underlying
malignancy.

CT Abdomen [**2178-8-31**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Probable right upper lobe/right suprahilar mass with
postobstructive
pneumonia. Right sided mediastinal and right hilar
lymphadenopathy and
contralateral mediastinal nodal enlargement. If this is a mass
such as from malignancy, this is probable T3 N3 M0. However this
may represent dense right upper lobe consolidation from
infection, but less likely.

2. Homogenous enlargement of the left adrenal gland may relate
to a
nephrectomy as no focal adrenal lesion is shown.

3. Possible right first rib invasion, this can be confirmed with
a PET-CT or limited MRI of the chest wall, if clinically
appropriate.
Result communicated by telephone to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 86984**] medical
resident, at 3.44 PM [**2178-8-30**].

Cytology: [**2178-8-31**]
-Transbronchial FNA of 3 lymph nodes: negative for malignant
cells.
-Bronchial Washings: negative for malignant cells
-unable to biopsy dominant mass via bronchoscopy

Brief Hospital Course:
50 yo F tobacco user with hx of stroke, hyperlipidemia and
hypotension who presents with RUL pneumonia and hypotension
concerning for septic shock.

# Hypotension/sepsis: Differential included sepsis, medication
effect, hypovolemia.  The patient was stablizied with fluid
boluses.  A CXR showed a consolidation in the RUL more
consistent with a mass than infiltrate.  She was initially
started on ceftriaxone and levofloxacin to cover for community
acquired pneumonia. She was continued on levofloxacin alone for
a 14 day total course.

# RUL opacity - A CT Chest was obtained which was consistent
with a pancoast tumor of the right lung with mediastinal nodes
on the opposite mediastinum. The pulmonary team performed a
bronchoscopy with endoscopic ultrasound. They were unable to
biopsy the dominant
