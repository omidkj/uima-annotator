OSA, and CHF, transferred today from [**Hospital6 28728**] Center
with hypercarbia, somnolence, transferred now to ICU with
hypercarbia, hypoxemia.  She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Date range (1) 37820**]
for low back pain and found to have L2 and L3 compression
fracture.  Hospital was complicated by ICU transfer for
hypotension and concern for sepsis.  No infectious etiology
found.  She presented to [**Hospital 1121**] Hospital [**2144-8-11**] with anemia
(Hct 25) and somnolence, thought to be due to methadone and
Ativan.  Her INR on admission was 13.4.  She was treated with
narcan, BiPap, diuresed with Lasix, and rate controlled with
digoxin and metoprolol.  She was also treated for pneumonia with
Zosyn and underwent thoracentesis [**2144-8-18**] which showed
transudative effusion (protein 2.0).  She may have been treated
with steroids. Last ABG: [**2144-8-20**]: 23:15- 7.41/72/59 on 50% FiO2
from 7.44/57/74 on 50% FIo2 on [**2144-8-16**].  She was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

On arrival to the floor she was somnolent, tachypneic 40s, and
saturating 90s on 50%ventimask.  ABG 7.45/70/62.  On

Brief Hospital Course:
78yo woman with h/o BOOP, chronic back pain d/t compression
fracture, diastolic CHF, Afib, PMR. Pt went into hypercarbic
respiratory failure and died.

#For her respiratory failure, she is a known CO2 retainer due to
chronic lung disease, thought to be secondary to
amiodarone-induced BOOP.  She required intubation and was
ultimately found to have a pneumonia.  She was treated with
vancomycin and levaquin, as well as stress-dosed steroids.  Once
her BP stabilized, she was diuresed and extubated on [**2144-8-28**].

#  Back pain:  known compression fractures; on chronic steroids
without treatment for osteopenia b/c did not tolerate
bisphosphonate. continued neurontin

#  Metabolic alkalosis:  no history vomiting or diarrhea; likely
contraction alkalosis from diuresis, although not hypochloremic
as would be expected. diuretics were held.

#  Hypernatremia:  likely intravascularly depleted; free water
deficit 3.3L.  replete with D5W
.
#  Anemia:  baseline Hct 36, now 32; guiaic negative.  previous
iron studies [**7-/2144**] most consistent with anemia of chronic
inflammation
.
#  HTN: holding losartan, atenolol given hypotension in ICU
.
#  Atrial fibrillation:  dofetilide continued. holding atenolol
as was hypotensive

#  PMR: continued steroids and plaquenil per outpt regimen
.
#  Anxiety/depression: continued Zoloft
.
#  PPX: anticoagulated, PPI, pneumoboots
.
# Communication: daughter HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 37821**]; [**Name2 (NI) **]  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 37822**]
.
# Code status - full(discussed with patient and daughter)
