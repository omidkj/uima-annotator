Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
coronary artery disease/Thyroid mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Coronary artery bypass grafts x 4(LIMA-LAD,SVG-OM1,y
y-DG,SVG-OM2),Left thyroidectomy [**2131-9-28**]


History of Present Illness:
This 70 year old white female vasculopath underwent intervention
for a left ankle ulceration in [**Month (only) **].  She had angina and
ruled in for an infarct at that time.  Catheterization then
demonstrated significant left sided disease and preserved LV
function.  She also has a large substernal goiter, which by
prior biopsy was not malignant.  This was removed after
sternotomy.  She is admitted now for revascularization and
partial thyroidectomy.

regulations. No TEE related complications.
Conclusions
Pre Bypass: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened and the posterior leaflet is heavily calcified.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (trace to no mr). There
is no mitral stenosis. There is no pericardial effusion.
Post Bypass: Patient is paced on phenylepherine infusion.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms.[**Known lastname 13393**] was taken to the Operating Room where Coronary artery
bypass grafts x 4(Left Internal Mammary Artery was grafted to
Left Anterior Descending ,Saphenous Vein Grafted to Obtuse
Marginal1,Y-Diag, SVG-OM2) were performed.  The  thyroid mass
was also resected after sternotomy. Cross clamp time=69 minutes.
Cardiopulmonary Bypass time= 86 minutes. Please refer to the
operative note for further details. The thyroid mass was excised
after sternotomy and then revascularization was done.  She
weaned from bypass on neosynephrine and Propofol. Intubated and
sedated, she was transf
