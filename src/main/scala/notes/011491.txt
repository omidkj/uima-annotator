Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
DES to proximal LAD ([**2193-5-21**])


History of Present Illness:
83M with HTN presents with acute onset of chest pain that awoke
patient from sleep at 2 AM. The pt reported pain in L chest,
non-radiating left sided chest pain/pressure/constant X2 hours.
He reported this to his son who subsequently brought him to the
ED. He took his atenolol 50mg in the evening.

In the ED initial vials 96.6 56 130/62 16 100%RA. ECG notable
for EKG with anterolat ST elevations and reciprocal depressions.
Trop <0.01. The pt was given ASA 325mg, Plavix 600mg and started
on a Heparin gtt. The pt was brought directly to the cath lab.

While in the cath labe the pt was noted to have a LAD thrombus
which was removed. The pt received a prox LAD DES.

On arrival to the CCU (was boarding in the CVICU) the pt is
chest pain free.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 year old male with history of hypertension presenting with
anterior STEMI complicated by paraxsymal afib.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Anterior STEMI: Pt found to have ST elevations
anterio-laterally on arrival to the ED.  He underwent cardiac
catheterization revealing proximal LAD thrombus requiring
thrombectomy and DES to proximal LAD.  TTE showed LVEF of 30%.
He was started on aspirin, plavix, atorvastatin 80 mg po qdaily
and IV heparin post-catheterization.  Treated with beta blocker.
ACE-inhibitor initially was deferred secondary to SBP<90. As
blood pressure improved, was weaned up to metoprolol tartrate
25mg PO TID and linsinopril 5mg PO daily. IV heparin dc'd on
[**2193-5-26**] once INR was theraputic to 2.2 on coumadin 2.5mg PO
daily. He will follow up with outpatient lab work to check INR,
chem-7 and CBC on [**5-27**]. He was discharged on ASA, Plavix,
Statin, Metopolol Succinate 75mg, Lisinopril for his CAD.

# Atrial Fibrillation: During hospitalization, pt was noticed to
flip in and out of afib with RVT to 130-150 and NSR with rates
60-75.  He responded well to IV metoprolol and was started on
amiodarone. Pt remained in and out of afib through day of
discharge.  He will be discharged home on amiodarone. 200mg [**Hospital1 **]
with close follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] the week following
discharge.

# Acute Sytolic CHF: TTE showed LVEF of 30%. Clinically
hypervolemic. Pt resonded well to Lasix 20-40mg IV daily with
adequate diuresis. Pt with 1/4  crackles bilaterally on d/c.  Pt
discharged with lasix 20mg x 7 days.

# HTN: Managed on metoprolol tartrate 25 mg PO TID and
linsinopril 5 mg PO daily with blood pressures remaining in the
110-120s/50-70s.  He was switched to Metoprolol Succinate 75 mg
PO daily upon discharge.

INACTIVE ISSUES:
# Elevated TSH: Pt noted to have TSH of 4 during
hospitalization. This should be followed up as an outpatient and
rechecked. TFTs were not sent given TSH is an acute reactant.
