[**2166-7-6**] CXR :
Status post removal of a left-sided chest tube from the
pneumonectomy cavity.  The height of the air-fluid level is
comparable to the previous examination.  Remnant gas collections
in the left lateral chest wall and the cervical soft tissues.
Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly.  Unchanged normal appearance of
the right lung.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the hospital and taken the Operating
Room where he underwent a left pneumonectomy.  he tolerated the
procedure well and returned to the SICU in stable condition. He
had an epidural catheter placed for pain management which was
effective.  He maintained stable hemodynamics and underwent
vigorous pulmonary toilet and remained free of any pulmonary
complications.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor he continued to make
good progress.  His chest tube was removed on post op day #2 as
was his epidural catheter.  He was placed on scheduled Tylenol
and Dilaudid orally for pain. Serial chest xrays showed the
expected fluid progression in the cavity.  He was tolerating a
diabetic diet and ambulating independently.  His preadmission
Coumadin was started on [**2166-7-6**] at his home dose and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
will follow his INR which was 1.2 on [**2166-7-8**].

Of note, his voice seemed a bit hoarse post op and he had a
digital videostroboscopy performed on [**2166-7-8**] which showed an
immobile left vocal cord.  He will return in a few weeks to the
[**Hospital **] Clinic for medialization.  In the interim he underwent a
video swallow along with a complete speech and swallow exam
which showed that although his vocal cords are not adducting
fully, his laryngeal vestibule and epiglottis are functioning as
expected and diet modification is not needed at this time.  He
will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in a few weeks.

Following completion of his swallow evaluation he was discharged
to home on a regular diet and will have VNA services for
cardiopulmonary assessment along with INR checks.
