.
CXR: Comparison is made to [**2146-9-7**]. The heart size is
normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.
Atherosclerotic
calcifications again involve the aortic arch. The pulmonary
vascularity is
normal. Hyperinflated lungs are consistent with history of
obstruction. While linear left basilar scarring is again noted,
ill-defined lingular opacity is of unclear etiology. There is no
pleural effusion or pneumothorax
.
CT Chest ([**2-15**]): Severe emphysema is diffuse, associated with
bronchial wall thickening and irregularity, suggesting small
airway disease. Areas of peribronchial, peribronchiolar and
peripheral consolidation are bibasilar, mostly on the left,
consistent with multifocal pneumonia, less likely aspiration.
5-mm nodular portion of the left lower lobe consolidation
(4:150) warrants further followup. Lingular ground-glass opacity
and mucoid impactions are present. Upper lobe centrilobular
ground-glass nodules could be related to infection or
respiratory bronchiolitis if the patient is a smoker. A right
calcified granuloma is tiny. 2-mm lung nodules are as follows:
Subfissural right upper lobe (4:76), lingula (4:142) and left
lower lobe (4:188). The main pulmonary artery is enlarged up to
3 cm wide, and the right pulmonary artery is up to 2.6 cm. The
aorta is calcified. Coronary artery calcifications are heavy.
Aortic annulus and valvular calcifications are scattered. There
is no lymph node enlargement using CT criteria. There is no
pleural or pericardial effusion. Airways are patent to the
subsegmental level. This study was not tailored for
subdiaphragmatic evaluation except to note severe aortic and
vascular calcifications. Degenerative changes of the spine and
prior surgery of the right humeral region are present. There is
no bone lesion suspicious for malignancy.
.
CT head ([**2-16**]): Evaluation is slightly limited by patient
motion, despite repeat attempt to scan. There is no intracranial
hemorrhage. There is no sign of mass, mass effect, edema, or
acute vascular territorial infarction. Ventricles and sulci are
prominent, likely reflecting age-related atrophy. There is also
moderate periventricular and subcortical white matter
hypodensity, most consistent with sequelae of chronic small
vessel ischemic disease. Vascular calcifications are present in
the bilateral carotid siphons. Visualized osseous structures are
normal. Mild mucosal thickening is seen in the ethmoid air
cells. There is partial opacification also of the left mastoid
air cells.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is an 84 year old male with history of severe COPD admitted
multiple times in last year with COPD exacerbations who
presented with 3 days of increasing dyspnea at home. No change
in color or quantity of sputum, no increased cough, no fevers or
chills. These symptoms were in the setting of a recent decrease
in his steroid dose from 10mg every other day to 10mg every 4
days (although there is no documentation in medical record of
this change and outpatient pulmonologist denies having changed
his dose). On admission a Chest X-ray showed possible lingular
infiltrate that could be consistent with pneumonia therefore
levofloxacin was started as well as high dose oral steroids for
COPD exacerbation. Clinically patient improved within 36 hours
and we were considering discharge to home, however on Sunday at
~7am, he became acutely dyspneic, tachypneic, tachycardic and
hypertensive. He was transferred to MICU for further management.
.

Brief MICU course: The patient was placed on CPAP with
subjective improvement of his dyspnea. Once weaned from CPAP, he
again became dyspneic and it was thought to be largely due to
his increased work of breathing, as his ABGs were consistent
with chronic COPD. After administration of low-dose morphine and
lorazepam, he was able to sleep well night and subjectively felt
better this AM ([**2147-2-14**]). He also was believed to have a
componenet of diastolic heart failure that was contributing to
hic clinical condition and rate control was achieved with
diltiazem. He was called out to the Gen Med floor on [**2147-2-15**].
.
Back on the medicine floor, patient's respiratory status
remained tenuous with continued dyspnea and tachypnea at rest. A
repeat Chest X-ray showed possible right lower lobe pneumonia.
At this point, patient had completed 5 days of oral antibiotics
for community acquired pneumonia therefore he was started on
Vancomycin and Zosyn for possible hospital acquired pneumonia.
He was also restarted on azithromycin for immunomodulatory
effect as well as IV steroids given his tenuous respiratory
status. A follow-up Chest CT confirmed a bilateral, multifocal
pneumonia and antibiotics were continued to complete a 7 day
course of vanc/Zosyn (last day on [*
