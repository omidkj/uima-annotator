none

History of Present Illness:
HPI: This is a 51 y/o F c/ a significant past medical history of
Hep C/cirrhosis, removal of prosthetic right hip for hardware
infection, recent hospitalization for sepsis (pseudomonas +
blood
cultures), was admitted to the hepatology service yesterday
afternoon for hyponatremia and [**First Name3 (LF) **] (Na of 120 and a K
of
6.2). The patient's lactulose was stopped one week ago for
diarrhea. In addition, the patient was recently seen at an
outside hospital where a CT showed possible osteomyelitis of the
right sternoclavicular joint. Based on nursing assessment, the
patient was obtunded on admission. Overnight, she was hypoxic
(O2
sat 87% RA), hypoglycemic, and hypothermic (T 93.4). Her O2 sats
improved with 2L FM. Her BP remained normal the entire evening
(SBP 100-130s). While her O2 saturations improved, the patient
continued with an altered mental status. The patient was
transferred to the SICU and the [**First Name3 (LF) **] surgery service.

Studies:
[**8-13**] CXR: 1. Although lower lobe opacities have improved from the
prior radiograph, the possibility of residual or recurrent
infection should be considered in the appropriate clinical
setting. 2. Dilated loops of bowel in upper abdomen are
incompletely evaluated on this chest radiograph. Dedicated
abdominal radiographs may be helpful to exclude an obstructive
process.

[**8-14**] CXR: 1. NG tube in appropriate position. 2. Small bilateral
pleural effusions, left greater than right, slightly increased.
3. Increased retrocardiac opacity concerning for worsening
atelectasis or infection.

[**8-14**] Duplex Doppler Abd U/S:  Decline in MPV velocity and high
distalTIPS velocities concerning for distal stenosis at the
TIPS/HV junction. Further evaluation recommended.

[**8-14**] CT Head: 1. No acute intracranial process. 2. Aerosolized
secretions and mucosal thickening within the right sphenoid
sinus.

[**8-14**] LENI: No DVT of either lower extremity.

[**8-15**] CT R clavicle: 1) Destruction of medial right clavicle with
exuberant adjacent callus formation. The appearance may be
post-traumatic, but infection cannot be excluded. If clinical
concern for infection remains, biopsy/aspiration could be
performed with CT guidance. 2) Patchy opacification
predominantly in right lower lobe incompletely assessed on this
examination however appears similar to findings of [**2160-7-4**]
and may represent chronic atelectasis with possible
infectious/inflammatory process.

Brief Hospital Course:
51 yo woman with h/o HCV cirrhosis (c/b encephalopathy, ascites,
s/p TIPS) and septic hip, with recent admission for pseudomonas
bacteremia, admitted with hyponatremia, [**Month/Day/Year **] and
subsequent decompensation with hepatic encephelopathy in the
setting of pneumonia and UTI. Her hospital course by problem was
as follows:
.
# Hyponatremia- Likely secondary to poor PO intake superimposed
on chronic hyponatremia in setting of cirrhosis. Patient's
baseline sodium is 128-133. She was given albumin with gradual
improvement of her sodium levels.
.
# [**Month/Day/Year **]- On admission, patient with K of 6.4. Had peaked
T waves on EKG and is complaining of myalgias for the past week.
She was treated with insulin, calcium gluconate, albuterol, and
kayexelate. Her [**Month/Day/Year **] was attributed to her recent
decrease in lasix dose from 120 to 80 mg. Lasix was increased
during this hospitalization to 80 mg [**Hospital1 **] and spironolactone was
decreased to 100 mg daily. Patie
