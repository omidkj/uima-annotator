Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
82 year-old Russian speaking F w/ hx of PE in [**2190**], off coumadin
now x6 months, IDDM, HTN, dyslipidemia, Parkinson's, dementia,
GERD, and hx GI bleed, p/w with one day history of dyspnea,
although per her daughters sx may have persisted for several
days but pt only mentioned them to family yesterday. Apparently
yesterday she developed SOB which was worse with exertion, and
episodes of left-sided CP that would last for approx 10 minutes.
 CP resolved on its own, and was not associated with any
diaphoresis, palpitations, nausea or vomiting.  Patient also
reported LLQ abdominal pain, [**7-31**]. Last BM yesterday, no
diarrhea, and patient has not had any recent change in appetite.
 No fevers, chills, productive cough or dysuria. No recent
surgeries; however daughters report pt has prolonged periods of
immobility as she generally sits at home in a chair for long
periods of time and does not get up much. She needs help with
all of her ADLs including cooking, cleaning and bathing/dressing
herself. Her daughters also report her memory is not what it
used to be and that she generally knows her name but has
difficulty with dates.  Presented to ED for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97 76 107/63 18 98%. Exam
unremarkable. Stool guiac negative. Labs notable for CXR showed
no acute process; EKG showed NSR=77, nonspecific lateral TW
flattening, unchanged compared w/ priors.  CTA chest showed
bilateral PEs, and patient was started on heparin gtt.  In the
[**Name (NI) **], pt was initially uncomfortable, moaning, c/o rectal pain and
pulling off 100% NRB. While attempting to place [**Name8 (MD) **], RN heard
pts family screaming that pt was unresponsive w/ red face adn
eyes rolled back into her head. Heparin gtt was shut off and pt
woke up and began responding to family w/n 5 min without
intervention. While awaiting ambulance transport, pt was noted
to have decreased SBP to 70s and was given 1L NS, with
improvement in BP from 74/52 to 105/56. Initially, thrombolysis
was considered given pts hypotension; however, hemodynamics
stabilized.
.
While in ED she had two episodes of probable syncope vs. seizure
associated with bradycardia and desaturations, responsive to O2.
CT head negative for acute intracranial process, though showed
8mm right frontal extra-axial lesion, likely a meningioma, and
stable since [**2183**]. Temp after head CT decreased to 95.2, warm
blankets applied. Also received 1L NS, 20 units humalog total
for FSBS >400.  She was admitted to the MICU for further
evaluation and management. She was also given 1g CTX x1 for UTI
in ED.
.
On the floor, pts BPs are in the 110s and she appears
comfortable. Her daughters state her sx probably went on for a
week but she only began to complain yesterday. She has memory
deficits at baseline, does not perform ADLs, and is largely
immobile.

[**2193-2-19**] CTA Chest/abd
1. Bilateral pulmonary emboli.
2. There is mild wall thickening of the gastric antrum and
pylorus, which may represent gastritis and appears slightly
improved from prior exam.
3. Stable appearance of hepatic hypodensities, likely cysts.
4. Calcified uterine fibroid.

[**2193-2-20**] TTE
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with moderate global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Small, hypertrophied left ventricle with
near-hyperdynamic systolic function. Moderately dilated right
ventricle with moderate hypokinesis. The RV apex has preserved
function ([**Last Name (un) 13367**] sign). Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2191-11-7**], the RV appears more dilated and hypokinetic than on
prior. On the prior echo, the RV was mildly dilated/hypokinetic
and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 13367**] sign was probably present at that point also.



Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE
This is an 82 y/o Russian speaking F with a history of prior PE
[**10/2191**] status-post 6 months of coumadin, who presented with
several days of dyspnea found to have massive B/L PEs,
hemodynamically stable, started on lovenox bridge to coumadin
and discharged home with services.
.
ACTIVE
# Pulmonary Embolus: patient was a/w dyspnea, found to have
multisegmental PEs, without right heart strain on TTE, placed on
enoxaparin bridge to coumadin.  Discharge INR was 1.1, so
patient was continued on enoxaparin bridge with close follow-up
with PCP and [**Hospital3 **].
.
# UTI: Admission urine culture grew out pansensitive ecoli.
Patient was without signs of systemic infection, received 2d
ceftriaxone, and was discharged on PO
