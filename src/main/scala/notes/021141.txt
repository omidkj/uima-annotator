Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
Dehydration, anion gap metabolic acidosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 75 y.o. male with past medical history of coronary
artery disease s/p CABG, pacemaker placement, ? of cirrhosis,
and EtOH abuse who presented on [**2201-3-24**] with four or five days
of nausea/vomiting, malaise, and poor PO intake.  He denied any
bloody emesis, hematochezia/melena, or diarrhea and was still
passing normal bowel movements and flatus.  He reported that his
nausea wasn't constant but seemed to be increasing in frequency
and severity over the days just prior to presentation.  He
reports abdominal pain was a minimal portion of this syndrome.
He reported some occasional right sided, non-radiating,
non-exertional chest pain that had been going on about a month.


In the ED, VS:T98.3 HR94 BP120/96 RR 20 98%RA. Given  his
history of alcohol abuse he received thiamine, folate, K, and
NS, as well as D50 followed by NS, prochlorperazine, and
ondansetron for nausea.  He continued to have non-bloody and
non-bilious but profuse emesis despite antiemetics.  He
continued to vomit profusely while in the ED. Labs revealed an
elevated lactate at 2.9 and an anion gap metabolic acidosis with
HCO3 of 10.  VBG with pH of 7.19, HCT 32, Tn 0.03. He was
transferred to medicine for further management.  On arrival to
the floor the patient was more comfortable and vomiting less,
however, ABG showed a pH of  7.15.  Given concern about the
possible dangers of this acidemia and presumed need for closer
cardiac monitoring he was transferred to the MICU.

greater than 40 years ago (stopped at age 31).  He continues to

 He is separated from his wife but continues to see her
regularly and wants her informed of his condition.

MICROBIOLOGY
============
Stool Culture [**2201-3-27**]:
CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final [**2201-3-28**]):
               FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.

OTHER STUDIES
================
Right Upper Quadrant U/S [**2201-3-25**]:
IMPRESSION: Somewhat limited evaluation. Liver appears
echogenic, a finding which can be seen in fatty infiltration.
More advanced forms of liver disease, such as cirrhosis or
fibrosis cannot be completely excluded.  Gallbladder is
contracted and filled with stones.

Chest Radiograph [**2201-3-28**]:
IMPRESSION:
New patchy opacity at right base of uncertain significance -- ?
new
atelectasis versus early infiltrate versus differences in
appearance due to
change in positioning. If clinically indicated, a lateral view
may help to
further assess this finding.

ECG [**2201-3-24**]:  Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality and
occasional ventricular ectopy.  Right bundle-branch block. Left
anterior fascicular block. Probable prior inferior myocardial
infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2199-10-7**]
ventricular ectopy has appeared. Otherwise, no diagnostic
interim change.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 75 year old male with past medical history of coronary
artery disease status post CABG, EtOH abuse, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, and pacemaker placement who presented with
probable viral gastroenteritis causing nausea, vomiting, and
dehydration with hospital course complicated by C difficile
colitis and pneumonia.

1) Anion-Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient presented with an
anion gap metabolic acidosis in the context of poor PO intake
and significant vomiting.  Given elevated lactic acid and
improvement with IVF this was presumed due to dehydration in the
patient's GI complaints and poor PO intake.  This had resolved
by transfer to the floor and did not recur.

2) Nausea/Vomiting: Given lack of any localizing signs of acute
bacterial infection and lack of abdominal pain or other symptoms
as well as lack of diarrhea on presentation this was thought
most likely to be consistent with a rather severe case of viral
gastroenteritis with dehydration exacerbated by the patient's
generally poor self care and deconditioning.  As he had some
right sided abdominal pain at presentation he also had an
ultrasound of this area, which showed no choleycystitis.  The
patient's symptoms improved with anti-emetics and he had less
vomiting but he remained somewhat reluctant to eat out of fear
of nausea.  He then developed C difficile colitis with frank
diarrhea and had some worsening of his baseline nausea on PO
metronidazole therapy.  Prior to discharge (on [**2201-3-31**]) he was
switched to PO vancomycin given his persistent severe diarrhea
and the patient's ICU stay suggesting he met criteria for severe
disease and thus vancomycin might be the preferred [**Doctor Last Name 360**].

3) Dehydration: The patient was considerably dehydrated at
presentation, presumably due to his vomiting nausea causing
extremely poor PO intake in the context of baseline poor
nutrition and poor self care.  This improved with IV fluids as
well as the patient's general symptoms.  Given the patient's
continued poor PO intake and nausea he continued to require IV
fluid through the time of discharge to prevent dehydration and
hypotension.

4) Acute Kidney Injury: His creatinine was elevated at 1.3 at
presentation but had fallen back to 1.1-1.2, which is within
this patient's normal range, by time of transfer back to the
floor.  This was thought to be consistent with prerenal injury
secondary to dehydration/hypovolemia.

5) Hypoglycemia: Initial blood glucose of 40 at presentation.
This was thought likely secondary to poor PO intake and alcohol
use.  This resolved with dextrose and never recurred.

6) Clostridium Difficile Colitis: The patient did not have
diarrhea or abdominal pain at presentation and had no history of
antibiotic treatment.  Therefore, there were no major risk
factors for C. difficile colitis and this was not checked.  When
he developed diarrhea on [**2201-3-27**], howe
