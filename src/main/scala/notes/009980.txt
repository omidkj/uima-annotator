right heart catheterization


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 75 year old man with severe COPD on home O2 (3-5L),
pulmonary hypertension and recent ECHO showing severely dilated
Right ventricle and atrium who presented to the ED from OSH with
hypotension.  He was in his usual state of health until the
night prior to admission when he felt a little weak.  He went to
bed early and when he woke up the weakness persisted and so he
went to his PCP because of concern that he was developing a
cold.  His wife had been sick the whole week prior and he was
worried he had caught something.  In his PCP office, his SBP
were found to be in the 70s and he was sent to OSH who then
transferred him to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
Of note, the patient has lost 13-15 pounds over the last few
months since he started taking the torsemide.  In addition, he
noted that he has episodes of lightheadedness in the morning
when he sits up in bed.  This began after he started taking the
torsemide. Pt has a chronic cough and has DOE at baseline that
may be slightly worsening over the last 2 weeks.
.
ROS was negative for chest pain, chest pressure, diaphoresis,
nausea, vomiting, jaw pain, arm pain, numbness or tingling,
orthopnea, PND, URI symptoms, dizziness, syncope, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, joint pain, myalgias, increased sputum
production
.
In the ED the patient's VS were 108/52, 106, 22, 87% 4L.
Patient's ekg was NSR @ 106 with LAD, with incomplete RBBB, V1-5
TWI.

II. Radiology
A. [**3-17**] CXR
FINDINGS: Two AP upright portable views of the chest were
obtained. There is patchy right base opacity which may in part
relate to overlying structures, though is more prominent than on
the prior study, underlying consolidation from infection or
aspiration is of concern. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
seen. The cardiac silhouette remains top normal. The aorta is
calcified and tortuous. Minimal central pulmonary vascular
engorgement is suggested.

COMMENTS:
1. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated left
sided
filling pressures with an LVEDP of 13mmHg at baseline with
minimal
change with 100%FiO2 and nitric oxide. There was severely
elevated
pulmonary artery systolic pressures of PASP of 77mmHg with
minimal
change with admistration of 100% fio2 or nitric oxide. There was
mildly
reduced cardiac index at baseline of 1.93L/min/m2 with mild
improvement
with introduction of 100%fi02 and nitric oxide.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe pulmonary artery hypertension not responsive to
inhaled
vasodilators.
2. Severe right ventricular diastolic heart failure.
3. Elevated PCW consistent with mild LV diastolic dysfunction.
4. Additional plans per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] and the Pulmonary division.

B. ECHO ([**2182-3-20**])
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Due
to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is
markedly dilated There is abnormal septal motion/position
consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume overload. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral
