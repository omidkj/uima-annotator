Chief Complaint:

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
preop for MVR-case aborted

History of Present Illness:
62 y/o male with severe CAD, s/p CABG [**2124**], s/p CABG [**2132**]
(LIMA-LAD, SVG-RCA, SVG-Diag, SVG-OM), s/p PTCA and BMS to
SVG-OM on [**2147-11-8**] at [**Hospital1 18**], dilated cardiomyopathy, severe MR,
moderate PA HTN, and chronic AF on coumadin. He was planned to
undergo MVR by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] [**12-11**] but after intubation patient
crashed, PA line with PA pressures equal to systemic pressures.
He had insertion & removal of ECMO femoral cannulas with closure
of R femoral [**Month/Year (2) **] with perclose device [**12-11**] Dr. [**Name (NI) **]
didn't want to do right thoracotomy and one lung ventilation
with high pulmonary pressures. The surgeons considered doing an
from mediansterotomy, but if doesn't go well then they wanted a
back-up out strategy of ? LVAD +/- ? heart transplant. The
patient refused this option and now is being medically managed
for his heart failure.
.
ON transfer to the CCU he was complaining of no CP or SOB. He
can lie flat in bed without SOB. Denies swelling in legs. Does
endorse feeling lightheaded when standing or walking. Few weeks
ago he had black stools for ~1wk. UGI and LGI scoping in last
1.5 years with only benign polyps. He was told to avoid ASA at
the time.

[**2147-12-13**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed. 20% given the severity
of valvular regurgitation.] Global hypokinesis with inferior
wall akinesis.
3.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe (4+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure.
4.There is moderate pulmonary [**Month/Day/Year **] systolic hypertension.
5. The RV function is deverely reduced.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2147-12-8**], the MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] are slightly less while the EF is
slightly reduced. However the MR is worse relative to the study
of [**2147-12-11**].


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 62 yo M with severe MR transferred to CCU for medical
management of his heart failure.  As described in the HPI, he
was admitted to the surgery team for MVR.  He was hospitalized
for about a week before the surgery, and he was planned to
undergo MVR by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] [**12-11**].  DUring induction, he
crashed.  A PA line was placed and showed PA pressures equal to
systemic pressures. He had insertion & removal of ECMO femoral
cannulas with closure of R femoral [**Month/Year (2) **] with perclose device
[**12-11**]. He quickly stablized after this event and was transferred
to the CCU for medical management as the patient did not want
surgery with if the risk was LVAT and transplant.  He wanted to
improve his CHF at least to allow him to walk across a room. The
rest of his hospital course is described below.
.
#cardiac:
.
PUMP: LVEF of 20% and severe MR 4+ on latest ECHO. Patient does
not want surgery if there is possibility of LVAD or transpant
needed if surgery fails. He prefers medical management. He was
euvolemic by exam.  He was briefly tried on a milrinone drip;
but it became clear that he did not want to go home on an IV
infusion although the milrinone did help his [**Doctor Last Name **] units
improve.  This was discontinued and his Swan line was pulled.
He was kept on lisinopril 10, coreg 3.125 [**Hospital1 **], lasix 20 daily.
He walked with nurses prior to leaving and was asymptomatic.
.
ISCHEMIA: s/p CABG x2 years ago and PCI in [**10-24**] with stent to
SVG to OM.  He was continued on plavix and aspirin as well as a
beta blocker and ACEI.
.
RHYTHM: He remained in rate controlled afib throughout his
hospitalization.
He was kept on a heparin gtt during the hospitalization, and
then transitioned to warfarin 4 prior to discharge.  He will
follow up with his PCP for INR check.
.
#anemia: normocytic anemia. HCT decreased likely secondary to
blood draws and surgical procedure. He had recent c-scope and
UGI in last 1.5 years with only benign polyps seen. He was told
to avoid ASA at that time.  He was started on low dose ASA and
maintained on a PPI for GI ppx. He was transfused 1 Unit of
pRBCs for a low HCT of 24.8.  His hct was stable prior to
discharge.
.
#FEN: heart healthy, low sodium diet. Replete lytes prn. Fluid
restriction
.
#PPX: coumadin for afib. PPI for GI ppx given possible h/o of GI
bleeding
