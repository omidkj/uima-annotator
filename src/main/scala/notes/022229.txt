field
cut.  Left facial droop in upper motor neuron pattern. Tongue
midline.  Palate appears to elevate symmetrically.

and left upper extremity.  Strength in right upper/lower
extremity appear full.  Left upper>Left lower extremity
weakness.
Will withdrawl to deep nailbed pressure in both left arm and
left
leg so at least [**1-21**] but no spontaneous movement.  Unable to grip
with left hand.

Sensation: appears mildly reduced on left hemibody as response
to
pinch is less brisk compared to right.

Reflexes: difficult to elicit secondary to increased tone.  Toes
upgoing bilaterally.

Coordination: unable to assess.

Gait: unable to assess

-----
Neuro: awakens to voice. drowsy. Nonverbal. Only seems to follow
the command "wiggle your toes" on the right. Eyes dysconjugate -
left eye depressed compared to right. Left facial droop.
Flaccid, edematous LUE with no movement. RUE moves
spontaneously. Wiggles right toes. No movement of LLE. Triple

left, mute toe on right.

Reports:
NCHCT [**2114-12-10**]: Right basal ganglia hemorrhage with
intraventricular extension and 2-4 mm of leftward midline shift.
Basal cisterns are patent.

CXR [**2114-12-10**]: Endotracheal tube with the tip in the mid
trachea.

CTA Head/neck [**2114-12-10**]: 1. Right gangliocapsular/thalamic
intraparenchymal hemorrhage with extension into the right
lateral ventricle and to a lesser extend to the left lateral
ventricle. Stable mass effect over the right lateral ventricle,
a 3 mm midline shift to the left and stable dilatation of the
left lateral ventricle.  No evidence of aneurysm. Mild
atherosclerotic disease with no significant stenosis.

NCHCT [**2114-12-11**]: 1. Stable right basal ganglia hemorrhage with
intraventricular extension. Since the prior CT, there has been
redistribution of the intraventricular blood with a small amount
layering in the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left ventricle. 4 mm of
leftward midline shift and mild effacement of the third
ventricle, unchanged. No new hemorrhage.

EKG [**2114-12-12**]: Sinus tachycardia and occasional ventricular
ectopy. Left atrial abnormality. Low limb lead voltage. Diffuse
non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2107-2-17**] sinus tachycardia and occasional ventricular  ectopy
have appeared. The limb lead voltage is diminished. Otherwise,
no diagnostic interim change.

MRI C-spine [**2114-12-12**]: Study is limited by motion. No evidence
of ligamentous disruption identified or intraspinal hematoma or
cord compression seen. Evaluation for subtle marrow edema is
limited, but no evidence of large areas of marrow edema
identified. No abnormal signal seen within the spinal cord
within the limitations of motion-related study.

NCHCT [**2114-12-13**]: . Stable right thalamic intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with intraventricular extension. Stable mild mass
effect with 4 mm of leftward midline shift. No uncal herniation.
Stable small right sylvian fissure intraparenchymal hemorrhage.
No foci of new hemorrhage or obstructive hydrocephalus.

CXR [**2114-12-13**]: A radiograph centered in the lower chest was
obtained for assessment of the feeding tube. The tube terminates
within the upper stomach. Previously present nasogastric tube
has been removed. With the exception of tube placement and
slight worsening of left lower lobe atelectasis, there has
otherwise been no relevant change in appearance of the chest
since the previous study performed earlier the same date.

NCHCT [**2114-12-15**]: IMPRESSION: Stable appearance to right
parenchymal hemorrhage centered in the basal ganglia with
minimal mass effect and no significant change in ventricular
size.

ECG [**2114-12-17**]:
Baseline artifact. Sinus tachycardia with sinus arrhythmia and
occasional
atrial ectopy. Low QRS voltage in the limb leads. Non-specific
ST-T wave
abnormalities diffusely. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2114-12-12**]
ventricular premature beats are no longer seen. Otherwise, no
diagnostic
change.

Left Upper Extremity Venous Doppler US:
FINDINGS:
The left cephalic vein is not visualized. The basilic vein was
tentatively
identified with color Doppler, but not seen on [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-scale
imaging and
compression of the basilic vein was not assessed. Otherwise,
there is normal compressibility and flow of the left internal
jugular, subclavian, axillary, and brachia
