[**Last Name (un) **] - bowel sounds present, soft, + distention, + tympanitic,

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the ED where a nasogastric tube was
inserted for decompression. Thereafter, she was admitted to the
ICU for close monitoring. On HD#[**12-19**], the patient was noted to
have borderline sufficient urine output. She was supported with
bolus intravenous fluids as needed. By HD#3, the patient's bowel
function had still not returned despite nasogastric
decompression and bowel rest.

On HD#5, the patient went into atrial fibrillation with
resultant hypotension (SBP 70s). The patient denied chest pain,
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting or diaphoresis. She was
cardioverted emergently and was restored to a normal sinus
rhythm after the third attempt. Her blood pressures were
restored with the normalization of her heart rhythm. She was
started on an amiodarone drip and was followed closely by the
cardiology service for the duration of her stay.

Plans were made to take her to the operating room for a
celiotomy and possible resection of bowel, but on HD#5, the
patient's bowel function returned. She passed flatus and had a
bowel movement. She continued to have persistent but improving
abdominal distention. Abdominal x-rays showed interval
improvement.  On HD#6, she was tranferred out of the ICU to a
floor with telemetry. She continued to make interval
improvement. On HD#7, she converted to atrial fibrillation
again. The episode was asymptomatic, and the patient maintained
her systolic blood pressures in the 140s. She easily converted
to a sinus rhythm after beta blockade.

On HD#8, she was discharged home in stable condition with full
return of bowel function and with no abdominal distention. She
was tolerating a regular diet without issue. She was given
instructions to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic and with
her cardiologist.
