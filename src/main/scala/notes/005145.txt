History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a pleasant 79M who underwent a R fem-PT bypass
with what appears to be non-reversed GSV approximately 2 months
ago at [**Hospital3 **].  He was, by report kept inpatient there
for 6 weeks post-operatively, finally discharging home on
[**2168-11-11**].  He had done well at home until this morning when he
had a sudden bout of large volume diarrhea and while in the
bathroom noted a substantial amount of bleeding from the R leg
distal incision site (which overlies the distal anastomosis). He
did not directly visualize the bleeding site as it was obscured
by his clothing and not still bleeding when this was removed.
He was with a visiting nurse at the time who applied pressure
and called EMS.

Per report, he was found hypotensive to the 70's in EMS arrival
and was disoriented and diaphoretic.  He was transported to
[**Hospital3 6592**] for further care.  In the ED at [**Hospital1 **] he was
normotensive and neurologically appropriate.  No bleeding was
noted and he had a hct of 32.  He was taking coumadin for a
peri-operative Dx of Afib and his INR was 3.2.  WBC at this with
was 27 and there was concern that he may be manifesting an early
septic picture.  He was started on broad spectrum Abx (Vanco,
Zosyn) and plans were made to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] as his surgeon
at [**Hospital 46**] Hosp was not available.

On Transfer, My [**Doctor Last Name **] was stable and had no furhter episodes
of bleeding.  He arrives afebrile, not complaining of pain and
completely neuro-motor intact.  He states that the index
operation was done for caludicaion with sx at 150 yards.  He has
bee able to achieve an active lifestyle, riding his bike, etc,
while at home these last several days.  He denies any bleeding
episodes prior to today.  He notes no history of local trauma of
that wound.

CXR ([**2168-12-2**]): No infiltrate, effusion or enlargement of the

EKG ([**2168-12-10**]): Sinus rhythm with atrial premature beats.
Probable intra-atrial conduction delay. Rightward axis is
non-specific and may be within normal limits. Since the previous
tracing of [**2168-12-9**] there is probably no significant change.

IMAGING:
[**12-2**] CXR:
FINDINGS: Single AP upright portable view of the chest was
obtained. The
lungs are hyperinflated, with flattening of the diaphragms,
suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Apical pleural
thickening is seen. There may be calcified pleural plaques
overlying the right greater than left lung apices which would
suggest prior asbestos exposure. No prior available for
comparison. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
small, in keeping with COPD/emphysema.
.
[**12-9**] CXR:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Overinflation, small bilateral pleural effusions,
retrocardiac
atelectasis. No evidence of focal parenchymal opacity suggesting
pneumonia.  Extensive vascular calcifications along the
supr
