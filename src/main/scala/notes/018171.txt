Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17211**] is an 81 year old male with a history of CAD,
diastolic CHF, COPD, and Alzheimers who was transferred from an
OSH for further management of hypoxia secondary to pneumonia. Of
note, patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**Date range (1) 50550**]/08
for chest pain and SOB. At that time he was transferred from and
OSH with CHF on CXR and a question of ST elevations on ECG.
However, in the cath lab he was found to have nonobstructive
CAD. He was diuresed during the course of his admission. ECHO
during that admission showed preserved systolic function. His
medications were changed: amlodipine to diltiazem to improve
diastolic CHF and home dose lasix was increased.

On the day of the present admission, the patient was noted to be
in respiratory distress by his family when they came to visit at
his nursing home. EMS was called and upon evaluation his O2 sats
were found to be in the 40s. He was described as pale,
diaphoretic, gasping for air, with coarse rales and rhonchi in
all lung fields. EMS noted vomitus and suspected aspiration. He
was placed on NRB, O2 sats improved to 90s and transferred to
OSH. There he had a CXR which suggested a R sided pneumonia. At
that time ABG with pH of 7.26/59/59. WBC was 36,000, 16%. TropI
elevated at 0.13 but CKs were negative. There he was also noted
to be vomiting. He received levo and flagyl and was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further managment.
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] ED, 97.1, 140/65, 107, 42, 76% NRB. O2 sats improved to
90s on BiPAP 20/5 with 100% FiO2. Lab showed leukocytosis of
21,500, BNP 1621. CEs negative. Electrolytes unremarkable. CXR
confirmed R sided pneumonia. He received aspirin and 1 gram of
vancomycin and was transferred to the ICU.
.
Upon arrival, patient remained on BiPAP. He was awake but not
interactive and not following commands. Unable to obtain ROS.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2111-12-17**]**

   DIRECT INFLUENZA A ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2111-12-17**]):
      Negative for Influenza A viral antigen.

   DIRECT INFLUENZA B ANTIGEN TEST (Final [**2111-12-17**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR INFLUENZA B VIRAL ANTIGEN.

[**2111-12-15**] EKG - Sinus tachycardia. Otherwise, baseline artifact
makes assessment difficult. Suggest repeat tracing. Since the
previous tracing of [**2111-10-19**] baseline artifact makes comparison
difficult.

[**2111-12-15**] CXR - IMPRESSION: Findings most consistent with a right
lower lobe pneumonia.  Recommend followup radiographs to
document resolution after appropriate therapy.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 17211**] is a 81 year old male with a history of CAD,
diastolic CHF, COPD, and Alzheimers dementia who was transferred
from an outside hospital for hypoxic respiratory failure.

# Pneumonia / Respiratory distress: The patient presented with
hypoxic respiratory failure, secondary to a multifocal pneumonia
seen on chest x-ray.  He was placed on NIPPV in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED
which was continued initially in the ICU.  The patient was
broadly covered for healthcare-associated pneumonia with
vancomycin, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone.  DFA was sent for
influenza virus testing which came back negative.  On the
morning of [**12-16**], the primary ICU team, the patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
the patient's family met to discuss goals of care.  Given his
underlying progressive dementia and low likelihood of meaningful
recovery, he was taken off of NIPPV.  Antibiotics were continued
in the case that he improved with supplemental oxygen.  He was
transferred from the MICU to the general medical floor to
continue antibiotics but with comfort as a goal should he get
worse from a respiratory standpoint.  On the medical floor
ceftriaxone was stopped as it was felt that the two other
antibiotics provided sufficient coverage.  The patient continued
to receive oxygen from a face tent with prn nebulized
bronchodilators for comfort.  The patient was also given
morphine IV prn to ease respiratory distress and hyoscamine to
decrease secretions to help make him more comfortable.  The
patient eventually stopped breathing and died on the morning of
[**12-19**].

# Sepsis: The patient met SIRS criteria on admission.  He
received antibiotics for pneumonia as above.

# Hypertension: Antihypertensives held given tenuous blood
pressures on admission.  Blood pressures were not checked on the
general medicine floor as comfort was the primary goal of care.


# Tachycardia: The patient presented with sinus tachycardia on
EKG.  Antihypertensives were held as above, including diltiazem.

# COPD: The patient was given albuterol and atrovent nebs.

# CAD: PO medications were held given the likelihood of
aspiration and goals of care.

# Anemia: The patient's anemia was at his baseline on admission.


# Alzheimer's dementia: The patient had a history of rapidly
progressive Alzheimer's dementia that likely contributed to
aspiration and his pneumonia.
