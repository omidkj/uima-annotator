Chief Complaint:
SOB/CP/AF

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

Procedure.
[**2171-4-12**] - Exploratory diagnostic laparoscopy conversion to open.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 54 y/o gentleman admitted for a redo mitral valve
repair and MAZE procedure. He has undergone several PVI
procsdures for AF with his last being complicated by tamponade
requiring emergent sternotomy. He now has 3+ MR documented by
ECHO. He is admittedprior to surgery after stopping his coumadin
for IV heparin in preparation for surgery.

Past Medical History:
-Atrial fibrillation
-Atrial flutter
-Hyperlipidemia, diet and exercise controlled
-Mildly elevated LFTs
.
CARDIAC HISTORY: Mr. [**Known lastname **] was initially diagnosed with atrial
fibrillation approximately four years ago. In [**2169**], he was
evaluated at [**Hospital1 112**] and subsequently underwent a pulmonary vein
isolation procedure by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3271**]. Unfortunately, that
procedure was complicated by a left ventricular hematoma and
perforation resulting in a cardiac tamponade and cardiac arrest.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken emergently to the operating room for relief
of his tamponade. He was in the intensive care unit for
approximately 15 days and ultimately discharged one month later.
Unfortunately, postoperatively, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 65974**] to atrial
fibrillation and was discharged on amiodarone.
.
In [**3-28**], he was found to be in atrial flutter, with heart rate
in the 120s. At that time, his [**Date Range 8863**]-XL dose was increased, he
failed DC cardioversion, and he was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
In [**2169-4-22**], he underwent successful ablation of reentry
around the anterior portion of the CS ostium by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
which was complicated by a prolonged vagal response and
post-procedure hypotension requiring dopamine infusion, IV
fluids, and atropine for resolution.  He was admitted to the
CCU, and at that time developed CHF which was likely  [**2-23**] to
fluids given for hypotension in setting of decreased HR after
ablation.
.
In [**12-28**], he was found at his follow-up visit to be back in
aflutter. In [**2170-1-22**], a second atrial flutter ablation
procedure was performed.
.
In [**1-28**], he had a successful atrial flutter ablation, completion
of previously done TV-IVC isthmus line of block.
.
In [**3-29**], his amiodarone was discontinued after PFT's revealed a
mild restrictive physiology and LFT's were found to be elevated.
.
In [**11-29**], he presented again with symptomatic palpitations and
was started on Digoxin. He had a repeat PVI on [**2171-1-24**] and
propafenone was initiated post-procedure.  DCCV on [**2171-1-29**].

Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of tobacco use.
There is no history of alcohol abuse. He was formerly a
Pediatrician for 18 years in [**Country 3992**] prior to emigrating to the
US ten years ago. He is married with three sons.


Family History:
His father died of complications of diabetes. There is no family
history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden death.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2171-4-23**] 4:18 PM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluation of infiltrate

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
54 year old man with s/p mv repair
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluation of infiltrate
TYPE OF EXAMINATION: Chest PA and lateral.

INDICATION: Status post mitral valve repair. Evaluate for
infiltrates.

[**Hospital **]: This is the first PA and lateral chest examination
since the preoperative study before mitral valve re-do operation
obtained on [**2171-4-7**]. There is status post sternotomy,
including a row of cutaneous surgical clips in the midline. A
left subclavian central venous line is in place, seen to
terminate overlying the SVC at the level of the carina. No
pneumothorax is identified. The overall heart size is now only
slightly larger than it was on the pre-re-do examination of
[**4-7**] and the cardiac configuration remains the same. A
left-sided lateral pleural sinus obliteration has developed and
as it does not continue into the posterior pleural sinus, it
most likely represents postoperative scar formations. Comparison
also reveals additional linear densities and a relatively
crowded vasculature in the left lower lobe consistent with
partial atelectasis, but no new parenchymal infiltrates are
identified. When comparison is made with the most recent single
view portable chest examination of [**2171-4-19**], the
previously present multifocal parenchymal densities as well as
pleural densities have regressed markedly and there is no
evidence of new acute infiltrates or increased pulmonary
congestion. As already noticeable on previous postoperative
examinations, there exists a faintly visible semi-circular thin
density consistent with a surgically performed mitral
annuloplasty.

IMPRESSION: Marked improvement of pulmonary infiltrates
encountered postoperatively to mitral valve annuloplasty and
MAZE procedure ([**2171-4-9**]). Moderate cardiomegaly as
before, presently no signs of pulmonary vascular congestion.
Left-sided basal scar formations and partial atelectasis.
