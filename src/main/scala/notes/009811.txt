Service:  GREEN SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 60-year-old male
seen in the Advanced Heart Failure Clinic with problems of
ischemic cardiomyopathy with chronic systolic heart failure,
left ventricular ejection fraction 30%, status post
non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, status post CABG in [**2135**],
status post PTCA in [**11-10**].  An exercise MIBI in [**4-12**] showed
a moderate reversible inferior wall defect with moderate
septal fixed defect, without change from prior study.  His
history also includes type 2 diabetes with recent worsening
of chronic renal failure with persistent hyperkalemia.  His
ACE inhibitor was stopped secondary to worsening creatinine
and hyperkalemia.

Patient presented at the clinic with worsening shortness of
breath and orthopnea.  He reports weakness and fatigue.  He
denied chest pain, palpitations, lightheadedness, or
dizziness.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%.
2. Insulin dependent diabetes.
3. Chronic renal failure.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Lasix 80 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Toprol XL 100 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Lipitor 30 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Imdur 30 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Actos 15 mg q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  A thin man.  HEENT:  Weight of 128 pounds.
Blood pressure of 98/60.  Heart rate 70 and regular.  JVD at
the angle of the ear.  Neck veins engorged.  Chest:  Rales at
bilateral bases.  Cardiovascular:  Left ventricular lift,
+S3, 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.  Abdomen was distended,
firm with hepatomegaly.  Extremities:  [**3-15**]+ pitting edema.

LABORATORIES:  From [**2151-10-18**] included a BUN of 102 and
creatinine of 2.2, which is stable.  Potassium of 4.8,
chloride of 92, bicarb of 29.3.

EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, borderline QRS prolongation,
ST-T wave abnormalities, which are unchanged from the
previous studies.

The patient was admitted to Cardiac Medicine for treatment of
congestive heart failure and diuresis.  The patient was on a
Natrecor drip, and [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted regarding
discontinuing the Actos.

A ventral hernia was noted upon admission.  Found to be
reducible.  Patient was also noted to have ascites.  On
[**10-21**], a BV ICD implant was implanted by EPS.  Please see
procedure note.  Patient tolerated procedure well and was
transferred back to the floor.  Patient was continued on a
Natrecor drip, and was diuresing well.

Patient's creatinine was decreasing to 1.7 on [**10-21**] and
[**Last Name (un) **] recommended q.i.d. fingersticks.  On [**10-21**], the
patient's hematocrit dropped to 24 and the patient was
transfused 2 units of PRBC to keep hematocrit above 30 with
IV Lasix in between.

Renal team was consulted regarding the patient's chronic
renal failure, and they recommended to restarting an ACE
inhibitor and to follow up as an outpatient.  Natrecor was
continued, diuresis was being continued, and the patient was
being monitored via telemetry, and strict I's and O's in
addition to laboratory values.

On [**2151-10-24**], Prandin was started secondary to elevated
fingersticks as [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **].  Glucose levels were being
monitored.

On [**2151-10-25**], the patient's ventral hernia was noted to be
nonreducible, and Surgery was consulted.  KUB was obtained
and the patient was placed NPO.  The patient reported
abdominal pain on examination.  Positive nausea and vomiting.
Patient was afebrile with stable vital signs.

A CT with p.o. and IV contrast was obtained, which showed
incarcerated small bowel with a ventral hernia and
intraabdominal ascites.

The patient was brought to the OR on [**2151-10-26**] for repair of
incarcerated ventral hernia.  Patient tolerated the procedure
well.  Please see op note.  The patient underwent an
unremarkable PACU course, and was transferred to the floor in
stable condition.  Patient was kept NPO with IV fluids, pain
medication, and Ancef antibiotic prophylaxis.  Prandin was
being held given NPO status and diuresis was halted as per
Heart Failure team.

Patient was afebrile with stable vital signs and a white
count of 6.6 on [**2151-10-28**] with stable electrolytes and BUN of
42 and creatinine of 1.3.  Patient was transferred to the
SICU on [**2151-10-28**] for labile blood pressures and increase in
heart rate.

Patient was given Morphine for pain control.  Metoprolol and
enalapril for cardiac medications, and blood sugars were
being controlled by regular insulin-sliding scale.  In the
SICU, the patient was afebrile with a blood pressure of
109/65, heart rate of 78, V-paced, sating well on room air,
good urine output and laboratory studies.  CK of 220, MB of
5.  Patient's vital signs were stable with heart rates in
70s-90s, and blood pressures systolic 100-120.  The patient
was started on p.o. medications and diet, tolerated well.

On [**2151-10-30**], patient was transferred back to the floor in
stable condition.  Plavix was restarted on [**10-31**] patient
tolerated a regular diet, gotten out of bed without problem.
Patient's pain control was adequate and the patient had no
complaints.

Cardiology was consulted for rise in troponin on [**10-26**] 0.05,
[**10-27**] 0.08, [**10-28**] 0.20, and [**10-29**] 0.16, [**10-30**] 0.25, and [**10-31**]
0.34 with CK MBs within normal limits.  Cardiology's
impression is this is a nonspecific troponin elevation in the
setting of elevated creatinine.  The EP service was consulted
secondary to episodes of tachycardia with the heart rates in
the 120.  They recommended adjustments of the settings.

On [**2151-11-1**], the patient was afebrile with stable vital
signs, tolerating the diet, no nausea or vomiting, plus bowel
movement (incontinence).  Patient was discharged to home with
services on [**2151-11-1**].  The patient was instructed to weight
than 3 pounds.  Patient was instructed to adhere to a 2-gram
sodium diet with fluid restriction.  Patient was instructed
to call physician if he experiencing fevers, bleeding,
drainage from wound site.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Incarcerated ventral hernia.
2. Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 30%.
3. Diabetes mellitus.
4. Chronic renal failure.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is recommended to call
the office of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for an appointment in two weeks.
Patient was instructed to see his internist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1968**], in
two weeks.  Patient is instructed to followup with the [**Hospital **]
Clinic regarding diabetic regimen.  Patient was instructed to
call Cardiology for follow-up appointment as an outpatient.

Patient is status post incarcerated ventral hernia repair on
[**2151-10-26**], BV ICD placement on [**2151-10-21**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.
