History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 83420**] was a 46 yo woman with acute myeloid leukemia (M5b
subtype) diagnosed in [**7-19**], which likely evolved from previous
MDS.  She failed induction therapy with 7+3 and HiDAC and was
noted to have a recent clinical response to treatment with
decitabine.  However, peripheral blasts were still seen on her
most recent bone marrow after the first cycle of decitabine. Her
situation had also been complicated by known CNS involvement of
her leukemia.
.
Given her excellent performance status, she had been undergoing
evaluation for possible allogeneic bone marrow transplant after
controlling her CNS disease (possibly with radiation therapy in
addition to chemotherapy). An HLA-matched unrelated donor had
been found who was a single B allele mismatch.  The most likely
preparative regimen would have been an ablative busulfan
Cytoxan/total body radiation Cytoxan, or a second choice a TLI
clofarabine ATG trial. Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 14047**] notes, most likely an
ablative approach would have been pursued, though a
reduced-intensity but relatively ablative approach would have
been a reasonable alternative.
.
For the time being, she had been receiving intrathecal liposomal
cytarabine every 14 days and Dacogen every 21-28 days. The day
of admission, [**2153-10-31**], was cycle #1 D#13 IT cytarabine and
cycle #1, D#17 decitabine. She had remained on prophylactic
moxifloxacin and voriconazole while neutropenic.
.
She had been feeling entirely well during her follow-up
appointments to clinic. On [**2153-10-31**], she presented complaining
of night sweats, abdominal pain, and vomiting, no diarrhea.  She
stated that she was also extremely fatigued and wished to sleep
all the time. Denied headache or visual changes but endorsed
"heaviness" of her head. She also endorsed increased SOB, but no
upper respiratory symptoms. No fevers or chills at home. She
stated that she felt pressure in her chest when laying on her
left side.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  +low-grade fever (measured in clinic),
+night sweats.  No  no cough, no sore throat, no headache, no
numbness or tingling, no focal weakness, +abdominal pain,
+nausea, +vomiting, +constipation, no diarrhea, no lower
extremity swelling.


Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC TREATMENT HISTORY:
1.  The patient presented on [**2153-8-8**] to [**Hospital6 2561**]
with fevers and severe shortness of breath.  She was found to
have an elevated white count of 114,000 with 10% blasts and
early
myeloid precursors.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  A bone
marrow
biopsy done on [**2153-8-8**] showed involvement with acute myeloid
leukemia, most likely M5b with monocytic differentiation.  The
marrow was 95% cellular out of which 80% were myeloid elements.
Cytogenetics were complex with deletion 4, derivative
chromosomes
7, trisomy 8 and deletion 11q23 and derivative chromosome 17.
2.  Treatment with 7+3 given on [**2153-8-11**].
3.  Followup bone marrow biopsy on [**2153-8-24**] showed 60%
cellularity
out of which approximately 20% were blasts.
4.  Treatment with high-dose ARA-C on [**2153-8-30**].
5.  On [**2153-9-12**] bone marrow biopsy showed 90% cellularity, which
was entirely comprised of monocytic cells consistent with
leukemia precursors.
6.  Cycle 1 of decitabine on [**2153-9-15**].
7.  Bone marrow biopsy on [**2153-10-5**] showed 60% cellularity with
blasts, were comprising 5-10% of the bone marrow.
8.  CSF involvement documented by presence of 7q deletion.
9.  Intrathecal methotrexate on [**2153-10-11**].
10. Cycle 2 decitabine on [**2153-10-15**].
11. Intrathecal liposomal cytarabine on [**2153-10-19**].

Other Past Medical History:
1. Rheumatic fever
2. Toxoplasmosis - causing spontaneous abortion at 8 months
gestation in [**2133**]

Social History:
She moved to US from [**Country 9362**] 7 years ago. Russian is her native
language. She also speaks English. She is married and has 2
sons, age 15 and 20. She worked as a home health aid. She has a
25 pack year smoking history, and quit approximately one week
prior to her diagnosis of AML. Her mother lives in [**Country 9362**] still
and is unaware of her diagnosis.


Family History:
Mother with history of breast cancer, father with history of
throat cancer.

CT TORSO [**2153-10-31**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval development of a new lingular consolidation, with
surrounding
ground-glass opacity, may reflect an infectious process. In the
setting of
leukemia a leukemic infiltrate, it cannot be excluded.
2. Moderate-to-severe emphysema, asymmetrically worse on the
right.
3. Persistent marked splenomegaly with areas of hypoattenuation
not seen
before, may reflect splenic infarcts or in the setting of
immunocompromised state an underlying infection can not be
excluded.

[**2153-11-3**]: MRI of head with contrast:
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild decrease in size of extra-axial posterior fossa
collections. T1
hyperintense irregular focus in the left cerebellum with mild
enhancement is grossly unchanged since prior exam.
2. Multiple punctate foci of negative susceptibility on gradient
echo images are stable since prior exam; however, significantly
less conspicuous since the exams prior, for example MRI from
[**2153-9-6**]. This apparent change is likely secondary to
technique as a 3T MRI was done [**2153-9-6**] and the last and
current MRI were done on the 1.5 T scanner.

CT ABDOMEN [**2153-11-5**]
IMPRESSION:

1. Interval development of diffuse widespread ground-glass
opacities and
interlobular septal thickening. There are also small bilateral
pleural
effusions. These constellations of findings are suggestive of
CHF or volume
overload. Less likely these findings could be related to
leukemic
infiltration or atypical infection.

2. Progression of persistent lingular consolidation which
notably causes
encasement and obliteration of a pulmonary artery branch.
Therefore this is
favored to represent either an aggressive infection, (an
atypical [**Doctor Last Name 360**] such
as fungus could be considered) or malignancy such as a focal
leukemic
infiltrate.

3. Left greater than right bibasilar consolidation could also be
infectious
in nature.

4. Low lying endotracheal tube in the proximal right main stem
bronchus.
Proximal repositioning recommended.

5. Em
