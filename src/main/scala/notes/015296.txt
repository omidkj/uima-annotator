Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Distension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
   57yo male with hx of HCV (no documented cirrhosis), HIV (CD4
count of 9; viral load of >100,000), CAD (s/p MI '[**82**] and cath),
CHF (EF <30%) who presents with acute new onset increased
abdominal distension.  Pt reports 5 days of progressively
increasing abdominal girth.  Initially, the patient attributed
this to constipation, however the abdominal disstension
progressed even after multiple large BMs.  Pt reports associated
SOB, progressive DOE over the last couple of days (previous
could walk at least 1/8th of a mile but now SOB after 0.5
blocks), orthopnea (progressive 2 pillow requirement) and ?PND.
Pt also reports he has felt "cloudy" with difficulty
concentrating.  Pt also reports difficulty sleeping, however
this has not changed and the pt attributes this to his baseline
mania/psych disorder.  The patient has not noticed a tremor.  Pt
denies abdominal pain, fever, chills, rigors, n/v/d.  Pt also
denies CP, palpitations, light headedness, dizziness, cough,
sputum production.
.
ROS: Pt does report a "few drops" of blood followed a BM last
week.  This was an isolated episode that resolved on own without
intervention.  Pt currently denies, BRBPR, black tarry stools,
stools with particular strong odors.  Pt reports [**1-28**] BM/day. Pt
also reports some inc. thirst, without polyuria.
.
The patient received a therapeutic/diagnostic paracentesis in
the ED.  850cc of fluid was removed. The fluid was sent for cell
count and diff, as well as protein, glucose, and amylase.
(Albumin was added on as was cytology later in the AM).

Past Medical History:
1). HIV/AIDS: Pt was previously on HAART successfully with fully
suppressed Viral load but is now comletely off HAART with CD4
count of 9 and Viral load of >100,000.
2). Hepatitis C - Length of disease unknown, has attempted
interferon and ribavirin tx in past but stopped due to malaise.
3). CAD s/p MI in [**2182**]: cath with LAD TO, LCx 60%, ostial RCA TO
and LVEF 27%
4). CHF: EF 27%
5). HTN
6). DM secondary to Crixivan
7). Pancreatitis secondary to meds
8). bipolar/schizoaffective disorder
9). h/o IVDU
10). PPD +

Social History:
Pt is a former merchant marine (has been to South East [**Female First Name (un) 8489**] and
[**Female First Name (un) 8489**]) who has retired due to disability and currently lives with
wife [**Name (NI) **].  Pt admits to former IVDU having used IV heroine from

One vessel coronary artery disease. Severe systolic ventricular
dysfunction and mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
-LAD: 20% narrowing in the mid vessel at the take-off of a D1
-D1: 40% lesion in the proximal vessel
-LCX: 60% ostial lesion
-RCA was totally occluded proximally and mid and distal vessels
were diffusely diseased and filled via R->R collaterals from the
proximal RCA and L->R collaterals
from the LAD
-PDA and PLV were small and diffusely diseased.
-mildly elevated left ventricular filling pressures with an
LVEDP of 13 mmHg.
-severely impaired left ventricular systolic function with a
calculated LVEF of 27%.
.
TTE [**2185-6-17**]:
-Left atrium is mildly dilated
-Moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
thinning/akinesis of the basal inferior wall,
thinning/dyskinesis of the mid-inferior wall, and hypokinesis of
the basal half of the inferior septum and inferolateral walls

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 57yo male with HCV, HIV, CAD with CHF EF <30% prents with
acute new onset ascites.

1. Respiratory failure - the patient was transfered from the
floor to the intesive care unit s/p intubation for increased
work of breathing. Chest CT was consistent with CHF and possible
pneumonia.  The patient was started on a broad spectrum
antibiotic regimen for his pneumonia.  He was placed on optimal
medical management for his CHF/CAD.  This regimen included
metoprolol, statin, ASA, and isordil. On this regimen the
patients blood pressures were well controlled.  On day 13 s/p
intubation the patient's respiratory status had improved enough
that an attempt at extubation was made.

2. Lymphoma - The patient was diagnosed with primary effusion
lymphoma by peritoneal cytology. The options for treatment
included HAART and chemotherapy but given the patient's
immunocompromised state, it was decided that the these treatment
options were suboptimal.

3.  ARF - The patients Cr slowly elevated over the course of his
hospital stay.  The etiology is multifactorial likely secondary
to pre-renal, ATN, and hepatorenal.

4.  Pancytopenia:  Pt has had an extensive prior workup for
pancytopenia and this has been attributed to HIV itself.
Although the patient is not currently neutropenic, appropriate
precautions were taken.  Hct and Platelet count were closely
monitored for signs of bleeding.

5.  HIV/AIDS:  Pt was previously on HAART with good success but
has been off HAART due to complications.  Prophylaxis was
continued with fluconazole, azithromycin, and dapsone.
.
6.  HIT antibody: The patient did not recieve any heparin
products given his HIT antibody.

7. ESLD - the patient was continued on lactulose.  With regard
to his ascites he was taped therapeutically x 2 and placed on
spironolactone.

8. CMO - On HD 14 the patients family wanted to the patient to
be made CMO a
