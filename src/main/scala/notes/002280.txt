History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 80 year old woman with multiple vascular risk
factors now presenting with acute onset left sided weakness and
slurred speech.  She was in her usual state of health until
around 9 am today when the son noticed that her left face was
drooping and she wasn't moving her left side.  He says she got
up
around 8 am and was initially fine.  She had her brought to
[**Hospital3 7571**]Hospital where her symptoms initially seemed to
resolve.  About 1 hour later (after CT scan), she acutely
re-developed the left facial droop, "flaccid paralysis" on left
arm and dysarthria.  She was started on heparin and transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further care.

She had a recent colonscopy where colon CA was discovered.  She
underwent a partial colectomy and was admitted to [**Location (un) **] from
[**4-7**] to [**4-15**].  During this time, her warfarin was held.  She was
restarted on upon discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
The patient is an 80 year old woman with multiple vascular risk
factors now presenting with acute onset left sided weakness.
Her
exam shows a left neglect, dysarthria, left sided weakness.  She
appears to have a significant territory right MCA stroke,
probably embolic given her subtherapeutic INR.  We will admit
her
to neurology and do the following:

1.  d/c heparin as her risk of bleeding is high
2.  start dopamine and achieve SBP 160-200
3.  obtain stat head cta
4.  obtain carotid US
5.  will check lipid profile
* * *
Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a non-contrast Head CT that revealed hypodensity
in the right subcortical and insular white matter consistent
with infarct.  CTA of the head revealed calcifications of the
carotid bifurcations, left greater than right, without
significant stenosis, but otherwise the major tributaries of the
circle of [**Location (un) 431**] were patent.  She was admitted to the intensive
care unit due to her need for pressors.  While there she began
to exhibit septic physiology, with a WBC up to 24, evidence of
DIC, and lactate as high as 14.  She was placed on
broad-spectrum antibiotics but her condition did not improve.
She had an echocardiogram on [**4-20**] that revealed left ventricular
cavity enlargement with severe regional systolic dysfunction c/w
multivessel CAD, right ventricular hypokinesis, and moderate
mitral regurgitation.  A chest CTA on [**4-19**] revealed a pulmonary
embolism within a left upper lobe segmental pulmonary artery and
bilateral pleural effusions.  As her overall condition continued
to deteriorate, a family meeting was held.  Ms. [**Known lastname 49482**]
siblings asserted that she would never want to be dependent on
others, even if it was for a few months.  Given her stroke, this
was almost a certainty, and it could not be said that she would
ever recover her independence fully.  This fact, taken together
with her deteriorating overall condition, brought her family to
decide that in accordance with her previously expressed wishes,
care would be withdrawn.  Hence on [**4-20**] care was withdrawn and
