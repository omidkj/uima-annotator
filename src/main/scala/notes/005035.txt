ADDDENDUM:  The patient's clinical status remained unchanged.
He remained unresponsive except for to painful stimuli.  He
showed no evidence of being able to follow commands.  It was
felt that this was likely due to the patient's uremia
secondary to his renal failure.  The patient's creatinine has
remained stable in the 4.0 range and on the date of discharge
was 3.8.  The patient's potassium has remained within normal
limits, last 4.1 on [**2163-12-30**].

There have been a number of discussions with the patient's
family regarding his extremely poor prognosis.  At this time,
the patient's family wishes to continue ventilating him and
treat any new conditions that may occur including infections;
however, they wish for him not to be resuscitated should his
heart stop.  As noted in the previous dictation summary, this
patient is not being offered dialysis as a result of his
overall poor prognosis and the opinion of the renal
consultants that he would not benefit from dialysis.
