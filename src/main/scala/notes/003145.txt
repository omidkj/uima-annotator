Service: MED

Allergies:
Bactrim / Fluoxetine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
AMS, urosepsis, Acute MI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right internal jugular central venous line placed in ICU


History of Present Illness:
82 y.o. F c h/o type 2 DM, HTN, PVD, and CRI (h/o urosepsis,
nephrolithiasis), interstitial cystitis presented from OSH
([**Hospital3 **]) with confusion/ UTI/ ARF/ hyperkalemia.

[**Hospital1 **] ED COURSE: Family brought pt in for increasing confusion,
[**Month (only) **] PO intake. She was feeling depressed about recent eye
surgery and eating/drinking less x7d, mild LBP, +dysuria, +f/c,
[**Month (only) **] UOP over past wk; no n/v/d, no melena, brbpr, abd pain. Pt.
presented c acute renal failure (hyperkalemia to 5.8, BUN/Cr.->
118/34, metabolic acidosis), wbc elevated w/bandemia and UTI on
U/A. She was tx w/levoflox 250mg iv x1, ca gluc, kayexelate for
K 5.7, 2L NS. Head Ct w/"layering, ?old blood". Bp at OSH
111/78. Xfer to [**Hospital1 18**].

[**Hospital1 18**] ED COURSE: T 97.4, p104, bp 95/38 RR 16, 100%/RAlowest bp
in ED dropped to 81/40. Labs remarkable for + MI: CK 127, trop T
1.16, MB 8, then rose to CK 404, trop 2.05, CKMB 29, MBI 7.2. Pt
tx w/4L NS for ARF, K 5.8 so given D50, insulin iv 10U ?x2,
kayexelae 30mg (+bm in ED), bicarb 2amps; then hep gtt and ASA
for MI.

HOSPITAL COURSE: admitted transiently (2hrs) to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**], then
acidotic by VBG 7.13/20/38, lactate 2.1, concern for urosepsis,
difficult fluid status. BP 120-130s, dropped to 100 at 2pm.
Given about 250cc of [**12-14**] NS w/part of an amp of bicarb. Tx w/CTX
1gm IV. Blood cx, repeat u/a +cx drawn, PIV placed. Xfer to
MICU.

In MICU, fluid resuscitated and given 1amp of bicarb followed by
po bicarb for bicarb level of 7. Changed abx to CTX and stopped
heparin after normalization of troponin and CK trending down.
Creat improved with fluid, almost back to baseline.  UCx
negative here, but started on Abx before drawn.   2u rpbcs given
on admission with stablization hct.

Radiology:

----CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2193-6-17**]:There is no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, shift of normally
midline structures or edema. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation appears intact throughout. The paranasal sinuses
are well aerated.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
----Bedside TTE [**2193-6-17**]: 1.The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%).
3.Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal

4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet
excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
5. Normal mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation
is seen.
6.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
------EKG [**2193-6-17**]: Wide complex tachycardia - mechanism uncertain
- consider "slow" atrial flutter/ atrial tachycardia with 2:1
response
Intraventricular conduction delay/ left bundle branch block
pattern
Clinical correlation is suggested
Since previous tracing of [**2190-5-13**], sinus rhythm absent and
intraventricular
conduction delay seen
-------RENAL U.S.  [**2193-6-17**] 6:50 AM: The patient is status post
right nephrectomy. The left kidney measures 12.6 cm. There is no
evidence of hydronephrosis, masses or stones.




Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: 82 yo F w/DM, htn, cri, R nephrectomy [**1-14**]
nephrolithiasis in past, presents in ARF, hyperkalemia, met
acidosis, UTI/pyelonephritis w/ urosepsis, and ruled in for
acute NSTEMI.  Uncomplicated MICU course and transferred to the
floor after 72 hours.

PLAN:
1.  CAD- NSTEMI in setting of hypotension, stress from ARF and
infection. Initially on heparin gtt which was discontinued after
enzymes started trending down.  Peak CK 910, trop 2.0.
Equivalent to positive stress test, therefore assume coronary
disease likely.  Will need formal evaluation as outpatient in
[**3-19**] weeks.
Her ASA and lipitor wer continued throughout her
hospitalization.  Her BBlocker was held transiently given her
hypotension, but then restarted and titrated back to her
outpatient dose of lopressor at 25 [**Hospital1 **].

2.  Acute on chronic renal failure/metabolic acidosis: FeNa < 1%
(prerenal) from dehydration/Urosepsis/MI.  Also hx of decreased
PO intake prior to arrival.  No hx NSAID use, held ACEI until
creat normalized.  s/p 6.5L IVF, mostly NS, w/improvement in
creatinine back to basline of 1.4.  Her lasix was discontinued
and she will f/u with PCP for reinitiation.

3. Diastolic CHF: Bedside ECHO (done for +trop, volume overload)
showed ef >55%, cxr w/mild CHF following fluid resuscitation,
thus may have decreased LV compliance [**1-14**] infarct w/diastolic
dysfsn.  Once hemodynamically stable, no issues with CHF with
Room Air sats high 90s and clear pulmonary exam.  Will need
repeat TTE as outpatient.  Restarted Lisinopril on discharge.

4. UTI/Pyelo/Urosepsis: u/a positive but UCx negative (abx
already administered at OSH).  UCx at [**Hospital1 1774**] ultimately grew E.
Coli in 10K-100K, senstivities not performed.   Patient straight
caths [**Hospital1 **] at home due to neurogenic bladder which is likely
source of infection.  Urosepsis improved with abx, IVF while in
MICU.  Foley d/c'd [**2193-6-19**] and UOP good without dysuria or back
pain.
She was continued on ceftriaxone x5 days and then switched to
cefpodoxime 200mg [**Hospital1 **] to complete a 14 day course.  BCx were all
negative.

5. Acidosis: bicarb as low as 5 in setting of urospesis, ARF.
Patient with history of "RTA" due to baseline low HCO3-.  Renal
team consulted and initially felt her to have Type I and Type IV
RTA given inappropriate wasting of bicarb in urine with
metabolic acidosis.  However, after discussion with patient, it
was discovered that she had ileal neobladder surgery [**98**] yrs ago
which accounts for her bicarb wasting.  Her prior diagnosis of
"RTA" therefore is likely to be incorrect.
She was sent home with sodium bicarb tablets at 1300 TID with
goal serum bicarb in the range of 15-17.

6. DM2: she was maintained on outpatient NPH
