[**2176-7-24**] CT Abd/pelvis :
1. Findings concerning for Mirizzi syndrome with gallstone
impacted in the
gallbladder neck, gallbladder wall edema, intrahepatic biliary
ductal
dilation. Small volume free fluid is noted. Please note, the
possibility of early gallbladder perforation cannot be entirely
excluded. Please correlate clinically.
2. No excretion of contrast is seen from the kidneys which
likely reflect
borderline renal function and hydration is recommended and this
recommendation has been discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5877**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10754**].
3. Grade 1 anterolisthesis of L4 on L5, stable.

[**2176-7-25**] Cardiac echo :
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded (posterior wall may be hypokinetic).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%).
The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Moderate pulmonary hypertension

[**2176-7-27**] Renal US :
Normal-appearing kidneys without hydronephrosis or other finding

to explain declining renal function. Please note, IV contrast
administered
during recent CT scan in the setting of borderline creatinine
(1.4) has a risk on contrast nephropathy and this could account
for acute renal failure - clincial correlation is advised

[**2176-7-29**] KUB :
Multiple loops of dilated small bowel and multiple fluid levels
are present.  There may be scattered gas within the colon, but
disproportionately less than is seen in the small bowel. No free
air is detected. Although this may represent ileus, the
disproportionate amount of air within small versus large bowel
raises concern for an early or partial small-bowel obstruction.



Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 40946**] was evaluated by the Acute Care team in the
Emergency Room and her abdominal CT was reviewed.  Based on her
severe abdominal pain and CT findings of a possible perforated
gallbladder she was taken to the Operating Room urgently for
cholecystectomy.  On [**2176-7-24**] she underwent an open
cholecystectomy after receiving fresh frozen plasma to reverse
her INR of 5. She tolerated the procedure well and returned to
the PACU in stable condition. She had adequate pain control but
had some episodes of mild hypotension and low urine output which
initially responded to fluid.

Following transfer to the Surgical floor she maintained stable
BP but her urine output continued to be 10-20cc/hr.  She had a
notable increase in  her creatinine over the next 48 hours,
peaking at 2.9. The renal service was consulted and felt that
her [**Last Name (un) **] was probably from ATN due to sepsis or post op
hypotension. In the mean time her Valsartan and Metformin were
discontinued and she received gentle rehydration.  She was also
slow to have return of bowel function and actually had a KUB
done which was notable for post op ileus.  She remained NPO and
was hydrated with IV fluids.  A nasogastric tube was placed for
gastric decompression and she eventually improved.  Once her
tube was removed her diet was gradually advanced and tolerated
well.  Her abdomen remained soft and she was making 1 liter of
urine daily with a creatinine of 0.9 at discharge. Per renal
recommendations, she remains off of Valsartan and Metformin.
Currently her blood pressure is 130/70 and her blood sugars have
been in the 100-150 range.

Her [**Last Name (un) 197**] was resumed on [**2176-7-31**] at 2.5 mg daily.  Her INR
prior to discharge was 1.0 and she will continue the current
dose and have an INR checked [**2176-8-5**] at which point Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 8682**] will resume her dosing.

After a long hospital course she was discharged home on [**2176-8-1**]
able to tolerate a diabetic diet, walk independently and her
abdominal wound was healing well. She will return for staple
removal next week.
