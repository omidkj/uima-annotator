History of Present Illness:
86 year old female referred for severe aortic stenosis. She had
presented to a hospital in Fla. with abdominal pain r/o SBO. She
was treated medically including volume resuscitation and CHF.
Workup revealed severe aortic stenosis. She was discharged after
a month to a local rehab. She had a recurrence of abdominal
pain, r/o ileitis and was transferred from an OSH to [**Hospital1 18**] for
tertiary care for her AS. She admits to shortness of breath
after
100ft, chest pressure after extended activity, inability to
climb more than a flight of stairs. Echo reveals [**Location (un) 109**] 0.6cm2,
mean gradient 64, peak gradient 5.2, asc. aorta normal diameter
by echo. She was referred here for aortic valve treatment
options. Recommendations were made for GI and [**Location (un) 1106**] input
regarding abdominal issues to better quantify surgical risk for
aortic
valve replacement.
    Patient was seen by [**Location (un) 1106**] surgery. Findings included mild
SMA stenosis though unlikely related to her hospitilization for
cecitis/ileitis. Celiac patent without stenosis.  SMA
borderline hemodynamically significant stenosis with no
recommendations for mesenteric stenting at this time.  She has
been cleared by the GI team and presents for admission prior to
CoreValve.

Pertinent Results:
[**2111-5-28**] ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF
80%). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is present. Mild
paravalvular (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe mitral
annular calcification. There is moderate thickening of the
mitral valve chordae. There is moderate functional mitral
stenosis (mean gradient 8 mmHg) due to mitral annular
calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. [In the setting of at least moderate to
severe tricuspid regurgitation, the estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure may be underestimated due to a very high right
atrial pressure.] There is no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2111-5-25**] for surgical
management of her aortic valve disease. She was worked-up in the
usual preoperative manner. On [**2111-5-26**] she was taken to the
operating room where she underwent a direct aortic percutaneous
aortic valve replacement via a hemisternotmy. Please see
operative note for details. Postoperatively she was taken to the
intensive care unit for monitoring. Later on postoperative day
one, she awoke and was extubated. Some postoperative delerium
was noted which responded to haldol and cleared over time. On
postoperative day two, she was transferred to the step down unit
for further recovery. Physical therapy was consulted for
assistance with her postoperative strength and mobility.
Diuresis was initiated. Coreg and lisinopril were resumed.
Plavix was initiated in accordance with the CoreValve protocol.
She continued to make steady progress and was discharged to
[**Location (un) **] House on postoperative day 6.  All follow-up
appointments were scheduled for the patient.
