Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5018**]
Chief Complaint:
Headache, worse than typical migraine HA


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is a 51yo W with a history
of depression and anxiety with ongoing psychosocial stressors,
history of pulmonary embolism and hypercoagulability,
degenerative disc disease, hypertension and asthma who presents
to the ED today with complaints of headache and malaise.

The history was obtained from the patient herself, who had just
received morphine (2.5mg) and reglan for pain and nausea. She
was
able to answer some questions related to history, but her
answers
were short and concise and her speech was quite slurred. She
would often fall asleep while speaking with me. The history I
was
able to obtain was such that the patient was in her usual state
of health this morning. This afternoon, she was at the cemetary
placing flowers at her mother and grandmother's grave (died > 10
years ago). While walking back to her car, she felt "weird" as
if
she "was on cloud 9". She confirmed that she felt "high". While
driving home, she had to pull over as she felt like her body was
"detached" from itself. She described a sensation of feeling
"Hot" in spite of "being the driver and sitting right in front
of
the AC". She had to sit on the side of the road for a while, and
felt "sick" and vomitted twice. However, she had to drive her
and
her family home because there was no one else who was able to
drive. At some point during these symptoms, she developed a
severe headache (the history is not clear). She describes this
as
a left sided retroorbital severe dull pain that is unlike her
prior migraines. She also described that her whole body hurt,
and
so EMS was called by son.

She was able to admit to me that there have been some recent
stressors at home. Her son has [**Name (NI) 3832**] syndrome. Her daughter
has bipolar disorder and is currently in a manic phase. She just
returned home from the psych hospital and has been difficult to
control at home. During this time, she complained that her mouth
was dry and asked for a glass of water.

At this point during my evaluation, she had the sudden urge to
urinate. I had not started a neurological or general physical
examination. The nurse arrived and noted that her speech was
more
slurred than prior - I had not noticed an acute change during my
interview, and assumed that the effect was related to opiate
narcotics. Her behavior suddenly changed. She became more
diaphoretic and agitated. She got up out of bed and started to
writhe her arms and legs in a violent, incoordinated and
nonpurposeful fashion. She turned to the side and started to
vomit repeatedly, yellow contents without food. A trigger was
called and the remainder of the team arrived into the room. She
received 2mg of ativan and IV zofran, and was transferred to a
trauma bay. At this time, she was somnolent, but following some
simple commands. Her vitals were hemodynamically stable, but her
blood pressure had increased to the 160s-180s range. She was
moving all of her extremities well and responding to noxious
equally in all four extremities. Her reflexes were symmetric and
2+ with downgoing toes and bilateral [**Doctor Last Name 937**] reflexes. The
decision was made to endotracheally intubate this patient. While
her airway at this time appeared to be well maintained, it was
thought that an MRI and LP would not be possible without
sedation
and that it would be difficult to predict whether her airway
would remain protected overnight. She was endotracheally
intubated and sent for CT imaging, including CT/CTA and CTV. She
was noted to have some tongue swelling following intubation, and
received a dose of IV benadryl. During the CT scan, she was
noted
to require high amounts of sedation.


Past Medical History:
- migraines
- h/o 3 DVTs and PEs on lifelong anticoagulation, currently on
Lovenox since she was not complaint with INR checks. ?Etiology.
- recurrent major depression
- pulmonary nodule
- low back pain [**3-13**] DJD
- asthma
- HTN
- Mild renal insufficiency (baseline Cr 1.2)
- hypothryoidism
- pituitary microadenoma
- anomalous pulmonary venous return
- HL
- nephrolithiasis
- Multiple prior ED visits (see OMR) for varied neurological
complaints, including left sided weakness, panpositive ROS,
dizziness with limb heaviness, subjective dysesthesias. On
examination, at those times, she has had functional neurological
examinations, and discharged with neuro urgent care follow up.
An
MRI has not been done, but CT/CTA/CTPs have been done for at
least two prior code strokes.


Social History:
lives with boyfriend. Daughter has
been in psychiatric hospital for several months. 1 pk/day

Family History:
Daughter with bipolar disorder, in
psychiatric hospital; son with autism or [**Name (NI) 3832**]
