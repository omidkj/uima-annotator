Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall at home, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line, A-line

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o with h/o CHF EF 45% p/w falls and concern
for safety while living at home given his physical decline.
Initial VS in ED 99 (rectal), 77, 125/80, 30 and 100% on 2L.
Per triage notes, pt is s/p witnessed fall yestereday and today
landing on coccyx after sliding from bed to floor.  Brought in
to ED with increasing AMS per family.  Per triage note, family
believes patient's breathing is at baseline.  While in ED,
patient then became hypotensive for unclear reasons, with lowest
BP 80/40 at 0450.  He was then given 500cc bolus and BP improved
to 95/55.  He was also ordered for 1u PRBC despite no drop in
HCT, but this was not given.  By time of admission to the ICU,
pt BP 94/54.  He did have a bedside U/S heart which revealed no
effusion.  EKG v-paced at 70 with Twave normalization in II and
new Twave inversion in V2, otherwise similar to EKG from
[**2157-10-10**].  Troponin also elevated at 0.05 (baseline 0.01) but
this is confounded by ARF on CRI (baseline Cr 2-2.2).  In this
setting he had a K of 5.4, and was ordered for kayexelated, but
not given.  Additionally, given his hypotension and fall, a CT
abdomen/pelvis was ordered to rule-out 'intra-abdominal
bleeding'.  This revealed slight amount of free fluid but with
density not c/w bleeding.  No IV contrast was given during CT.
UA consistent with UTI.

Physical Exam:

nursing this is his baseline)
HEENT: no JVD, no lymphadenopathy, MM dry, no skin tenting on
forehead
RESP: unlabored, a small amount of fine bibasilar crackles
CVS: RRR, no MRG but diff to hear over pt's moaning
ABD: distended, tympanic but not tense, soft, NT, fine pale
erythematous vascular rash across lower abdomen
EXT: no LE edema; bruising on UE, right forearm with swelling
but no edema
NEURO: moaning in bed, responds somewhat to voice and makes
purposefull movements, but does not follow commands

EKG [**2157-10-18**] Ventricular paced rhythm. Since the previous
tracing of [**2157-10-10**] probably no significant change. Atrial
rhythm is uncertain.

CXR [**2157-10-18**] IMPRESSION: Moderate CHF.

KUB [**2157-10-18**] PORTABLE AP PELVIS, ONE VIEW: This is a limited
study, with the lower pelvis only partially imaged and prominent
bowel gas which limits evaluation. There is a right hip
hemiarthroplasty, without evidence of dislocation. Assessment of
the sacroiliac joints and symphysis pubis are limited. There is
a non-obstructive bowel gas pattern.

CT Abd/pelvis [**2157-10-18**] IMPRESSION:
1. No intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage identified.

2. Moderate right greater than left simple pleural effusions
with compression
atelectasis and interstitial septal thickening which may relate
to acute or
chronic pulmonary edema.

3. Unchanged atherosclerotic disease including mitral annular
calcification.

4. Slightly nodular appearance to the liver which may suggest
underlying
cirrhosis. Cholelithiasis with no findings to suggest acute
cholecystitis.
Trace ascites.

5. Bilateral renal cysts as described above.

6. Extensive colonic diverticulosis but no findings of acute
diverticulitis.

[**2157-10-19**] CXR post PICC placement IMPRESSION:
1. Left PICC line terminating at the entrance of SVC, with tip
of the wire
likely ending at the lateral wall of SVC. Advancement would
bring tip
further into the SVC. Result was discussed with IV nurse, [**Doctor First Name **].

2. Stable pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions.



Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M w/ hx of DM, CAD s/p CABG ??????79, single chamber PPM, EF
40%, p/w falls and concern for safety.  Found to be in ARF and
hypotensive.

# Hypotension: Likely multifactorial. Possibly dehydration, ARF
and baseline low BPs per prior notes and discharge summaries.
Initially thought to have a component of sepsis given positive
UA, but nothing on urine culture and patient remained afebrile
and without elevation in WBC count.  Received IVF and dopamine
to keep SBP > 100 per renal recommendations.  Dopamine drip was
stopped when patient was made CMO.  Torsemide, Valsartan and
Carvedilol were held.

# ARF on CRI.  CKD baseline Cr 2-2.2.  Worsened during last
hospital course.  Attributed to starting Torsemide and
Valsartan, but discharged on these medications despite this.
Hyperkalemia likely attributable to worsened renal function.
Urine lytes consistent with prerenal etiology.  Family does not
want to pursue dialysis.
Torsemide and valsartan were stopped, sevelamer was continued,
renal diet once diet was advanced.  The patient's creatinine
continued to rise despite supportive measures with IVF and
dopamine to maintain blood pressure.  After discussion with the
family the patient was made DNR/DNI, and eventually CMO.  A
palliative care consult was obtained on [**2157-10-20**].

# Hyperkalemia: Likely [**1-22**] ARF on CRI.  He was given kayexalate
with good effect.

# Anemia: At Baseline.  On last admission attributed to his CRI.
 Discharged on ProCrit and iron.  +Guaiac positive in ED.  Would
not transfuse unless acute drop > 3pt or Hct <21 or e/o end
organ ischemia.

# UTI: UA positive in ED but cultures are negative.  The patient
was started on ciprofloxacin while cultures were pending and
this medication was stopped when cultures returned negative.

# Type II diabetes mellitus: Hold Glipizide. Monitor on ISS with
QID FS.

# CAD s/p CABG in [**2127**]: On aspirin and beta-blocker at home.
Beta blocker held for hypotension.

# BPH s/p TURP: On tamsulosin as outpatient.  Foley in place.
Tamsulosin was held given hypotenion.

# Sensory deficits: The patient has bilateral vision and hearing
loss.  The family brought in a device to assist the patient in
better hearing the team.  Family came to help reorient the
patient.

The patient was then transfered to the floor.  CMO status was
confirmed with the family and he was placed on a morphine drip.
He died peacefully a few hours later.
