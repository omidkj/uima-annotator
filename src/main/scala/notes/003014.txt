Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
CP and SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
41yo m w/ hx of dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 30%), HTN, NSTEMI,
and EtOH and cocaine abuse presented to OSH on [**9-14**] complaining
of worsening CP and SOB over previous 48hrs. Pt first developed
[**8-22**] substernal non-radiation CP he desribed as pressure. He
developed SOB several hrs after onset of CP. In ED, trop was
(+)and ECG notable for no ST changes with prev r-bundle. He was
started on a hep ggt and pressure relieved with 1-inch nitro
paste. Utox (+) for benzos, cocaine.

Pt was admitted and treated for NSTEMI w/ hep drip and acute on
chronic CHF exacerbation with IV lasix 40 [**Hospital1 **]. Following
admission he beame increasingly confused and diaphoretic with a
fever to 103.3 and was started on Zosyn and switched to
ceftriaxone/azithro. BC, UC, and legionella ag sent. Legionella
urine ag (+) and BG and UC no growth at 48hrs. On [**9-16**] pt noted
to be somulent and diaphoretic and thought to be in opioid
withdrawl. Given narcan with no response. He developed N/V
thought to be [**3-16**] narcain. He was treated with IV lasix as it
was believed he was fluid overloaded.  He continued to be
tachypneic and tachycardic with hr over 200bpm and was
cardioverted with 120J. It is uncertain which rhythm he was in
at this time (discharge summ says afib w/ rvr but original
signout says VT, nursing said SVT, no ECG provided. He was
intubated for airway protection and he was sedated with
propofol.  A CXR showed worsening b/l infiltrates.

On transfer, pt continued to be febrile to 103, tachycardic and
became hypotensive requiring phenylephrine. Pt given 250cc NS
bolus in transit. ABG prior to transfer was 7.32/39.9/141/20.

CXR: [**2197-9-25**]:
HISTORY:  Pneumonia and dilated cardiomyopathy, to assess for
fluid overload.
FINDINGS:  In comparison with a series of films from [**9-22**] and
through [**9-24**], there has been progressive decrease in the
bilateral pulmonary opacifications. The right lung is almost
clear with only some mild residual medially at the base.  There
is some more diffuse opacification involving the mid and lower
zones on the left.  The findings are consistent with the
clinical impression of clearing of pneumonia, though there may
well have been some associated elevation of pulmonary venous
pressure.
.
ECHO [**9-18**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated with
severe global hypokinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %). The basal lateral
wall contracts best. There is visual dyssnchrony. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global free wall
hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**2-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Marked left ventricular cavity dilation with severe
global hypokinesis c/w diffuse process. Mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation. Pulmonary artery hypertension.
.
ECG [**9-22**]:
Sinus rhythm with borderline prolongation of the P-R interval.
Right axis
deviation. Left bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2197-9-20**] the heart rate has increased. Other findings
are similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
41yo m w/ hx of dilated cardiomyopathy (EF 30%), HTN, NSTEMI,
and EtOH and cocaine abuse presented to OSH with SOB and
CP,found to have legionella PNA and ectopy with an episode of
sustained VT and is s/p conversion. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further EP evaluation.
.
#Septic Shock: Prior to transfer from OSH, patinet became
hypotensive and required phenylephrine on transfer. On arrival
to [**Hospital1 18**], it was believed he was most likely in septic shock
secondary to legionella PNA. Levophed and vasopressin were
started for BP support. Goal was to minimize levophed as pt was
having ectopy in the hrs following transfer. He was sedated with
Fentenyl/Versed as paramedics noted BP dropped very low with
propofol prior to transfer. An IJ central line, a-line and Swan
Ganz catheter were placed. Swan confirmed that shock most likely
secondary to sepsis with low SVR and normal CO. On [**9-18**], pt
received several fluid boluses with target CVP 8-12. BP
responded with good urine output. Vasopressin was discontinued
and pt kept on levophed.
.
#Atrial Fibrillation: Developed AF/RVR concurrent with pressor
therapy requiring cardioversion to NSR where he has remained.
Was initially started on amiodarone IV, then transitioned to
400mg PO TID on [**9-22**] but was eventually discontinued as pt
developed a confluent ras
