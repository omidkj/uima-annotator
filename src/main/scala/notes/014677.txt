Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1928**]
Chief Complaint:
SDH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 89 yo male w/ h/o afib on coumadin transferred from
[**Hospital3 **] with SDH. His symptoms began one month ago,
when he could not remember the day or the time.  Two days ago,
he fell out of a chair to the floor and was unable to pick
himself up.  He has no history of head injury or loss of
consciousness.  He phoned a neighbor who found him on the ground
and he was brought to an OSH hospital.

At [**Hospital3 **] his vital signs were stable, BPs ranged
from 100-120 systolic, HR 80s, maintaining O2 sats on 2LNC.
Laboratory data notable for absense of leukocytosis, normal
renal function, INR 4.3.  A RLE ultrasound was negative for DVT
given Right knee swelling.  A XR of the knee showed DJD with
effusion.  CXR showed interstitial edema.  Head CT and MRI which
showed small R frontal and R temporal SDHs and a small R
occipital intraperitoneal hemorrhage.  He was given 2 units of
FFP and Vitamin K to reverse his supratherapeutic INR (4.3) on
coumadin and sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for evlauation and management by
neurosurgery managment.

In the ED vital signs were 97.4   187/100   74   20   2L NC
ROS obtained was positive for generalized weakness.  He denied
headache.  CXR was obtained which showed signs of volume
overload and insterstitial lung disease.  He was given 40mg IV
lasix and transferred to the ICU.

On the floor, he was tired and unable to provide a history or
review of systems.

IMAGING:
CXR [**2124-10-18**]:
Stable cardiomegaly and moderate pulmonary edema with a small
right pleural
effusion. A chest x-ray following diuresis is recommended

CT head [**2124-10-18**]:
1. No significant interval change in bilateral subdural
hematomas, as well as a rounded hemorrhagic focus within the
right occipital lobe, which may also be extraaxial.
2. Punctate foci of layering hemorrhage within the occipital
horns of lateral ventricles, unchanged.
3. No new hemorrhage identified

CT C-spine [**2124-10-18**]:
1. No fracture identified.
2. Severe multilevel degenerative changes, with a grade 1
anterolisthesis of C5 on 6, of indeterminate chronicity.
However, clinical correlation is
suggested. If there is a high clinical concern for ligamentous
or cord
injury, an MRI is suggested

ECHO [**2124-10-19**]:
Mild left ventricular hypertrophy with mildly depressed global
systolic function. Severe diastolic dysfunction. Severe aortic
stenosis. Severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension

CT head [**2124-10-19**]:
1. No significant change in the subdural hemorrhages, noted, in
the right
frontal, right parietal and the left tentorial as well as along
the
cerebral convexity based on both sides compared to the most
recent study.
Follow up as clinically indicated.

CT Spine [**2124-10-19**]:
1. No acute fracture within the limitation of severe osteopenia.

2. Large lesion at S2 level, expanding and indenting S2, likely
large sacral Tarlov cyst. Underlying soft tissue component can
not be excluded and a MRI may be helpful in further evaluation.
3. Degenerative changes as described above.
4. Scattered areas of ground-glass opacity in bilateral lungs as
well as areas of atelectasis and small right pleural effusion.
Dedicated chest CT can be obtained for further evaluation if
clinically warranted.
5. Tortuous and dilated left iliac artery, 2.1cm
max.inadequately assessed. Color doppler study may be helpful

CT head [**2124-10-20**]:
No significant interval change from [**2124-10-19**].

MRI brain [**2124-10-21**]:
No acute infarcts seen. Previously noted bilateral subdurals and

subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as right sided intraventricular
blood products are identified. No significant new abnormalities
are seen

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 39392**] is an 89 yo male w/ PMHx sig for atrial fibrillation
on
[**Hospital 197**] transferred from [**Hospital3 2783**] with R frontal and
temporal DHs and R occipital IPH in the setting of
supratheraputic INR, thought to be related from unknown trauma
vs hypertension.

# Subdural hematomas: The patient was found to have R frontal
and temporal subdurals and R occipital IPH in the setting of
supratherapeutic INR.  This was reversed with Vitamin K and FFP.
  He was followed by NS, who determined that no surgical
intervention was needed at this time and recommended that Keppra
be started for seizure prophylaxis.  They had initially
recommended restarting ASA, but given the extent of his bleeds
and discussion with his family, it was decided to hold
anticoagulation until further evaluation with NSG in 1 month.
The patient continued to have L sided weakness and L hemineglect
on transfer to the floor, so Neurology was consulted. A repeat
MRI revealed no evidence of acute infarct and stable size of his
bleeds.  They felt that his bleeds could explain his previous
hemineglect.  On repeat examination, Neurology felt his hemi
neglect had and did not feel further intervention was needed.

He is scheduled for NSG follow up in 1 month with repeat CT
scan.

# Atrial fibrillation: The patient h
