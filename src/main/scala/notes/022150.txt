Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **], who is well known to the thoracic surgery service,
was admitted on [**2177-10-7**] with a left lung collapse secondary to
endobronchial obstruction with granulation tissue. Bronchoscopy
was performed on this date by Interventional Pulmonology, who
found that around the mid distal left mainstem the lumen was
progressively narrowed until it was a pinpoint size. The distal
left mainstem or the upper or the lower lobe orifices could not
be visualized. The patient returned to the floor after the
procedure in good condition and resumed a regular diet.

On [**2177-10-9**], repeat bronchoscopy was performed by Interventional
Pulmonology, who at this point found severe stenosis of the left
main stem bronchus with no visible distal airways that could be
visualized during this procedure. Plans were consequently made
for left pneumonectomy as endobronchial attempts to open up the
left mainstem bronchus had failed.

On [**10-12**] the patient's trach was converted from a cuffed
non-fenestrated to a noncuffed fenestrated in order to allow him
to speak.

On [**10-14**], the patient underwent a left pneumonectomy. He
tolerated the procedure well and spent 2 days in the SICU.

On [**10-15**], he was seen by ENT who performed a bedside
laryngoscopy and found left vocal cord paralysis. His left IJ
was rewired. He was transfused 1 unit of pRBCsfor an Hct of
24.5, which had dropped from 28.9. His Hct was 24.8 after the
unit of blood

On [**10-16**], his fluids were stopped for mild volume overload on
CXR. He recieved another unit of pRBCs, and his post-tranfusion
Hct was 28.2. He had a video swallowing study, which showed
laryngeal penentration of liquids but no aspiration; safe for
regular solids and thin liquids

On [**10-17**], his hct was stable, and was transferred to the floor.
He was started on clear liquids.

On [**10-21**], he underwent video stroboscopic exam with ENT, which
showed left vocal cord paralysis. He then underwent vocal cord
medialization on [**10-24**] with ENT for correction of this problem

The staples from his abdomen and thorax, as well as his sutures
from his former chest tube site were removed on [**10-25**].

Pt was d/c'd to home on [**2177-10-26**].
