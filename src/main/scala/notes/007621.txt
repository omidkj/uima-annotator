Brief Hospital Course:
Brief summary of hospital course:

65 y/o male with hx of ETOH abuse, HTN, cirrhosis, afib, who was
admitted for hematemesis +lightheadedness; Found to have 3 to 4+
esophageal varices,portal gastropathy. Banded x 6 at OSH. He was
transferred to the ICU here for management of HD stability. NGT
was placed in ED and he was initiated on octreotide and nadolol.
He was monitored overnight and was found to be hemodynamically
stable. He was transferred to the floor where octreotide and
nadolol were discontinued. The patient had noted bronchospasm in
relation to nadolol. Therefeore, he was subsequently started on
diltizem for rate-control of his afib. Anti-coagulation was
deferred given his risk of bleed. NGT was also discontinued
given his ability to tolerate PO's and absence of blood return.

He had noted large ascites by abdominal U/S. Paracentesis
demonstrated a WBC=110, Total protein 0.8, Alb <1 consistent
with portal hypertension (SAAG=1.8). Final cultures were
negative, so there was no evidence of bacterial peritonitis.
However, given his GI bleed/ascites, he was started on
prophylaxis w/ Levaquin and received a complete 7 day course.
Repeat screening EGD demonstrated gastric varices w/ cherry red
spot and he subsequently underwent TIPS without event.
Pre-procedure course was complicated by severe
wheezing/bronchospasm requiring intubation. He was subsequently
stabilized and TIPS was performed without complication. There
were no post-TIPS complications: No encephalopathy, No asterixis
pre or post procedure. He had a benign abdominal exam on
discharge. He was sent home on Cipro 750mg qweek for ongoing
prophylaxis. He is currently being evaluated for Liver
transplant, with f/u planned for 1 month with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**].

Of note, he was noted to have E.Coli UTI 10,000-100,000 R to
levaquin that we decided not to treat in absence of clinical
findings.
