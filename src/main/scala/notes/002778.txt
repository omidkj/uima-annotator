Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal Intubation
Transesophageal Echocardiogram


History of Present Illness:
  Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 71-year-old man with a PMHx significant for
systolic HF (EF 20-25%), old anterior wall MI, paroxysmal AV
block, atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, history of
ventricular fibrillation in the past, status post eventual BiV
ICD implantation with subsequent revisions due to the presence
of malfunctioning Fidelis lead, who presented to the ED this
morning with a chief complaint of dyspnea. The patient reports
that he began having a cough productive of dark beige sputum for
the past week. He also had some low-grade temps at home (Tm
99.8) earlier this week. He called his cardiologist on [**2141-2-28**],
complaining of this cough and LE edema. He was told to increase
his lasix to 60mg TIW and 40 mg daily the rest of the week. He
then presented to gerontology clinic on [**2141-3-1**] with similar
complaints. CXR and CBC done that day were unremarkable. He then
developed dyspnea over the past 24-36 hours. He called
cardiology clinic this morning and was instructed to present to
the ED.

  On arrival to the ED, the patient's VS were 97.1 80 100/60 22
96. He was noted to have crackles half-way up bilaterally. CXR
reportedly showed changes c/w pulmonary edema as well as a ? LLL
opacification. In the ED, he received Levofloxacin 750mg,
Vancomycin 1g, Ondansetron 4mg, and Furosemide 40mg. He was
admitted to the CCU for further management.

  On arrival to the CCU, the patient's VS were T= 98.7 BP=
103/67 HR= 76 RR= 21 O2 sat= 97% on BiPAP. He reported that his
dyspnea was improved. He stated that the chest pressure that he
experienced earlier had resolved. He endorses recent worsening
DOE and PND. He also reports some chest pressure last night and
this morning, which was located across his chest, did not
radiate, and has since resolved. He reports recent 5-pound
weight gain. He also reports recent loose stools and stable
urinary frequency.

  On review of systems, he denied any prior history of stroke.
He did report a questionable history of TIA. He denied any
history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding
at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denied recent chills or rigors. He
denied exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review
of systems were negative.

  Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of
palpitations or syncope.

CXR ([**2141-3-3**]) - IMPRESSION: Increased pulmonary edema.
Superimposed infectious process in
the left lower lobe cannot be excluded. Recommend follow-up post
diuresis.

CT Chest ([**2141-3-7**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. No intrathoracic abscess. Bilateral non-hemorrhagic
small-to-moderate pleural effusions, minimally loculated, if at
all, on the right.
2. Severe lower lobe and moderate upper lobe atelectasis.
Minimal pneumonia cannot be excluded.
3. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, likely reactive.

CT Head ([**2141-3-11**]) - IMPRESSION: No evidence of infectious or
other acute process.

CT Abd/Pelvis ([**2141-3-11**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of infectious process in the abdomen or pelvis.
2. Ground-glass opacity in lung bases may partially be explained
by fluid overload, although an infectious component should be
considered.
3. Slightly increased bilateral small pleural effusions with
associated atelectasis.
4. Unchanged postoperative findings related to prior Whipple and
hepatojejunostomy, with soft tissue in the postoperative bed,
which appears stable, of unclear significance.
5. Apparently new rectus muscle herniation containing
non-obstructed bowel.
6. Unchanged compression fracture of L1.

TEE ([**2141-3-14**]) - No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with septal, inferoseptal and inferior
hypokinesis. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. No mass or vegetation is seen on the
mitral valve. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate to severe [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen on the pacemaker/ICD leads (at
least 4 wires identified in the right atrium) or on the v
