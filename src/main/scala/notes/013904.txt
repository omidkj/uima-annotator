Chief Complaint:
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chest Pain
REASON FOR MICU ADMISSION: Hypotension


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mechanical Ventilation

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 75 year old male with a history of a prior MI,
HTN, aortic anyeurism, HTN, asthma who presented with complaints
of chest pain. Limited information due to intubation. Patient
developed chest pain this morning the monring of presentation in
the setting of diahrea for hte last 3 weeks. The patinet took 3
SLNG to good effect, but presnted to an OSH ED. CKs found to be
1600, and was started on dopamine for hypotension. While on
dopamine, the patinet reportedly developed a narrow complex SVT
of 180, and was given a dilt gtt and labatolol. This induced
hypotension, withsystolic blood pressures in the 70s. Levophen
was subsetquently added. The patient was given CTX due to a
leukocytosis, and transfered to the [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
For unclear reasons, the patient was intubated by EMS, although
no evidence of altered mental status, respirator distress, or
airway compromise. On arrival to the ED, HR 74, BP 64/47, 100%
on the vent. A RIJ was placed without complication. Given
unclear history of anortic aneyurism, hypotension, and chest
pain, the patient had a pan-scan to r/o abdominal catastrophe or
aortic dissection/anyeurism ruptrue. The CT revealed pan
colitis, and general surgery was consulted, who felt no emergent
surgical indication for likely c.diff colitis. In the ED, the
patinet was given 11L of NS, IV vanc, IV levoflox, IV flagyl,
and solumedrol. The patient was admitted to the MICU for further
manegement.

STUDIES:
========
[**12-18**] PORTABLE CXR:
IMPRESSION: Endotracheal tube in standard position 4.3 cm above
the level of the carina.  Nasogastric tube with side port in the
distal esophagus. Recommend advancement so that it is well in
the stomach.
Tortuous nasogastric tube course, while could be due to a
tortuous esophagus, other etiologies such as mediastinal
hematoma or aneurysm are of concern. Please see subsequent chest
CT. Bibasilar atelectasis with small size left pleural effusion,
underlying consolidation not excluded.
.
[**12-19**] CTA CHEST, CT ABD/PELVIS WITH CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings compatible with pancolitis and proctitis, most
likely infectious. This distribution is not typically seen in
ischemia.
2. Mild inflammatory changes of the appendix are likely related
to adjacent colitis; however, appendicitis can not be entirely
excluded.
3. Thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysm with extensive mural
thrombus and at least two likely small penetrating ulcers in the
descending aorta. Possible focal intramural hematoma of the
descending thoracic aorta, as above, although adjacent
atelectasis make assessment difficult.
4. Partial collapse of bilateral lower lobes, left greater than
right. Occlusion of the left lower lobe bronchus which may be
due to mucous secretions, although endobronchial lesion can not
be entirely excluded. Recommend follow-up to resolution to
exclude an underlying endobronchial lesion.
5. 5mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule can be reevaluated
with a follow-up chest CT in 6 months is patient has history of
smoking or malignancy and 12 months otherwise.
6. Cholelithiasis.
7. Focal oval-shaped structure with air-fluid level in the head
of the pancreas may represent duodenal diverticulum versus
distended distal common bile duct containg air and fluid.
Clinical correlation for any recent ERCP procedure is
recommended. Findings can be further evaluated with CT with oral
contrast.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU COURSE ([**2183-12-18**] - [**2183-12-20**])
==================================
Hypotension: The patient was admitted to the MICU for persistent
hypotension in the setting of pan-colitis. Likely sepsis from
presumed c. difficile. The patient was aggressively volume
resuscitated and weaned from vasopressor medications within 24
hours. His presumed c.diff was treated with PO Vancomycin and IV
Flagyl. Further chest imaging also revealed a possible LLL
pneumonia and collapse. He was started on vancomycin IV and IV
cefepime for a possible hospital acquired pneumonia. Sputum
culture returned with Coag + Staph only so cefepime was stopped
to avoid further worsening of possible c.diff. At the time of
transfer out of the MICU, he had been off vasopressor
medications for 12 hours and was otherwise hemodynamically
stable

Resp. failure: The patient was intubated by EMS prior to ED
presentation for unclear reasons, possible altered mental
status. He was extubated shortly after presentation to the MICU
and by the time of transfer out of the MICU, he was oxygenating
well on 2L nasal cannula. He was started on Advair for improved
treatment of his COPD and continued on nebulizers.

Thoracic/abdominal aneurysms: CTA imaging revealed both
