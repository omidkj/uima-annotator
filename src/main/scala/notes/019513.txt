History of Present Illness:
Pt. is a 32 year old painter w/PMH of unspecified childhood

Brief Hospital Course:
.

32 year old male Brazilian painter from [**Hospital3 4298**]
admitted to OSH [**9-13**] with 10 day hx of fevers to 102.5, chills,
nausea, vomiting, and a frontal headache and rash since [**9-12**].
Underwent extensive w/u at OSH that was negative (LP, babesia,
anaplasma, tularemia, lyme). Was placed on ceftriaxone and
doxycycline at OSH. Continued to have fevers, rash, and
[**Month/Year (2) **], thus pt transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] [**9-16**]. Shortly after
arrival, developed acute respiratory distress and hypoxeia, was
transfered to MICU [**9-17**]. Started on Vanc/zosyn. Imaging with
bilateral consolidation and pulm edema, with subsequent rapid
improvement over next 2days, thus more c/w pneumonitis and
vanc/zosyn stopped. His resp status remained stable on room air
and he had no other issues the rest of hospital stay.
He had an interesting rash on torso, face, arms, legs, and this
was biopsied by Derm (torso), which ended up showing acid fast
bacilli consistent with leprosy. However, per derm and ID, this
did not explain the more systemic process and was likley
something that he acquired long ago (given his origin from
[**Country 4194**]) but manifested itself during immunocompromised state.
Thus decided not to treat currenlty and he can have f/u as
outpt.
Further w/u ID/rheum was sent here and was NEGATIVE (see chart)
including hep serologies, EBV/CMV, herpes, HIV, [**Doctor First Name **]/ANCA/RF.
ESR/CRP were elevated as expected of systemic process.
He was kept on streptomycin initially until tularemia confirmed
negative. he was kept on doxy for tick borne disease and his
RMSF titers were [**Doctor First Name 80489**], thus he will complete 2week course
of doxi. On day of discharge, he mentioned that he had been told
he had schistosomiasis in the past in [**Country 4194**] and was not treated
for this. Spoke to ID attending, no good way to check for actual
infection vs exposure, but this can be addressed in [**Hospital **] clinic.
Toxo IgM also pending at time of discharge
Still did not have good explanation for his symptoms (LAD,
[**Hospital **], SM) after ruling out most infectious/rheum
illness, thus lymphoproliferative d/o (elevated LDH) high on
differential. He underwent excisional LN biopsy 9/26 per surgery
and results of this (cx, cytology, immunochem, pathology) are
pending at time of discharge. He will have f/u [**Hospital **] clinic with
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] since he knows the patient the best, who will make
further recs on follow up pending biopsy results.
By time of discharge, he was otherwise doing very well. having
low grade fevers but no HA or other complaints. Discharged in
stable condition.

Please see progress note below for detail:

.
Fevers,lymphadenopathy/SM, mild [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], Rash: Infectious
(viral/fungal) vs ymphoproliferative vs less likely
rheumatological.  Extensive infectious/rheum w/u thus far has
been NEGATIVE (LP, cultures (Abx stopped), babesia, lyme and
tularemia (streptomycin stopped), EBV, CMV, hepatitis, HIV,
autoimmune w/u). thus concern is now more for
lymphoproliferative d/o (esp given LDH elevated , diffuse LAD
and SM) or rare viral syndrome. Fevers have resolved, he is
doing much better.
-s/p excisional biopsy of inguinal LN [**9-21**], awaiting
Cx/stains/cytology/architecture
-he will f/u in [**Hospital **] clinic for this, they will contact him for
appointment. they will refer him to appropriate specialty
thereafter.
-per ID, since RMSF [**Last Name (LF) 80489**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] complete 2weeks of doxy,
discharge with 1 more week
-IgM toxo sent again today
-not treating leprosy for now as below.
.
.
Hypoxia/resp distress: bilateral consolidation and pulm
edema->MICU. Not much cough. Rapid improvement over 2days. More
consistent with pneumonitis or viral PNA. CT scan [**9-20**] still
with R basilar consolidation, but clinically NO PNA, so will not
treat (s/p vanc/zosyn X3days stopped [**9-19**])
-currently on RA
