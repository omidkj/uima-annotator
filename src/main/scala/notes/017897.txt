History of Present Illness:
This 58 yo male with long term nausea and vomiting [**12-25**] gastric
outlet obstruction and hx of recurrent pancreatitis and etoh
abuse went to outside ER with intractable nausea and vomiting fo
the past 2 days and unable to tolerate po intake. He was
admitted for failure to thrive and symptom control. In OSH he
underwent EGD on [**2117-6-15**] which demonstrated high grade gastric
outlet obstruction which is rather concerning. he's therefore
transferred for further evaluation and management. on arrival pt
has no complaint including pain.

Past Medical History:
-nausea and vomiting [**12-25**] gastric outlet obstruction at the level
of duodenum due to extrinsic compression by the pancrease.
- recurrent pancreatitis with multiple pancreatic pseudocysts
and distal common bile duct stricture.
- htn
- niddm
- c diff related diarrhea
- gastric ulcer [**2108**]
- alcohol abuse
- major depression requiring ECT in the past
- severe spinal stenosis from c3-c6 with myelomalacia and
central cord syndrome with profund bilateral lower extremity
weakness.
- chronic pain
- cervical laminectomy and fusion after decompression of c3-c6
[**3-/2117**]
- cholecystectomy
- appendectomy
- partial gastrectomy for peptic ulcer perforation.

CTA ABD W&W/O C & RECONS  [**2117-6-19**] 12:36 PM
IMPRESSION:

1. Mass-like conglomerate of calcifications in the head of the
pancreas that may be the cause of biliary obstruction. Marked
intrahepatic, extrahepatic and pancreatic duct dilatation.

2. Apparent mass in the second portion of the duodenum that may
be of inflammatory or neoplastic etiology.

3. Interstitial thickening and mild bronchiectasis at both lung
bases that may be related to chronic aspiration.
.
EGD [**2117-6-21**]
Retained fluids in stomach
Deformity of the distal bulb
A deformity was noted in the distal bulb. The endoscope could
not advanced beyond this area.EUS: Changes c/w severe chronic
pancreatitis noted in the body of the pancreas. Unable to
advance the echoendoscope into the duodenal bulb and beyond.
EUS was performed using a linear echoendoscope at 7.5 frequency:
The body of the pancreas was imaged through the body of the
stomach. Multiple hyperechoic strands and calcifications were
noted within the body of the pancreas. The pancreatic duct could
not be identified. These findings were consistent with severe
chronic pancreatitis. The echoendoscope could not be advanced
into the duodenal bulb, therefore, the rest of the pancreas
could not be examined.
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2117-6-26**] 1:47 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Pulmonary embolism involving segmental arteries of the left
lower lobe. Findings are discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the
time of dictation.
2. Interstitial thickening and scattered areas of tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]
opacity. This is a nonspecific finding, as noted above, may be
related to chronic aspiration.
3. Hilar lymphadenopathy and prominent mediastinal lymph nodes
as noted. 4. Intrahepatic biliary dilatation again identified.
.
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2117-6-27**] 4:03 AM
IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis of the lower
extremities.

.
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2117-7-6**] 11:46 AM
CONCLUSION:

1. No definite evidence of a segmental or subsegmental pulmonary
embolism or an aortic dissection.
2. Interstitial thickening, scattered areas of tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]
opacity and scattered patchy opacities in the lungs likely are a
combination of recurrent aspiration and consolidation.
3. Incompletely evaluated intrahepatic biliary dilatation likely
represents sequelae of obstruction due to pancreatic neoplasm.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2117-7-6**]
INTERPRETATION:
Findings:
LEFT VENTRICLE: Severe global LV hypokinesis. Severely depressed
LVEF.
 RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderate global RV free wall hypokinesis.
  GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. The
patient has runs of  a supraventricular tachycardia. Results

Conclusions:
1. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
20%) with minor
regional variations. The bases are more dynamic in comparison to
the distal
aspects of the left ventricle.
2. There is moderate global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis, greater
function in the base in comparison to the apex.
3. There is an echodensity in the right pulmonary artery
(artifact vs
thrombus). Cannot rule out thrombus in the PA.
.
PERSANTINE MIBI  [**2117-7-9**]

The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 30%.

IMPRESSION: 1. No obvious ischemic changes with exercise -
please see above
discussion. 2. Moderate global hypokinesis, EF 30%, with mildly
dilated LV
cavity.
.
 CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST  [**2117-7-16**] 2:56 PM
IMPRESSION: Moderate narrowing of the spinal canal at C5 level
due to osteophyte. This is not an acute finding.
.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2117-7-17**] 4:52 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of any pulmonary embolus.
2. Scattered areas of alveolar infiltrate with tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]
opacity bilaterally which are relatively unchanged when compared
with the previous CT from [**2117-6-26**]. Note is also made of
some mucous plugging and debris in the right mainstem bronchus.
The overall appearances are most suggestive of chronic
aspiration.
3. Subcentimeter mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
.
CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2117-7-26**] 11:52 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Marked intrahepatic and extrahepatic duct dilatation with
interval development of pneumobilia when compared with the
previous CT from [**2117-6-19**].
2. Pancreatic appearances consistent with chronic pancreatitis.
3. Dilatation of proximal loops of small bowel with fecalization
and distal decompression.
4. IVC filter in situ.
5. Atelectasis in the left base and airspace disease which may
represent chronic aspiration.
6. Bronchiectatic changes in right base.
.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE ONLY)  [**2117-7-29**] 10:45 AM

IMPRESSION: Few dilated loops of small bowel, consistent with
ileus. Relatively unchanged compared to prior study.
.
