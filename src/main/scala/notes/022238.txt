Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure and hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
 64yo male with PMH severe COPD (on 2L O2 and chronic prednisone
at baseline) presents with respiratory failure likely secondary
to COPD exacerbation. He was admitted to [**Hospital1 2025**] from [**2138-5-18**] for
COPD exacerbation and treated with azithro, steroids, nebs and
discharged to [**Hospital1 **] pulmonary rehab. Per family, pt was
signif symptomatically improved over past several weeks. At
[**Hospital1 **] today, pt was noted to be in respiratory distress with
desat in O2 saturation to 70-80s with poor air movement. ABG
there was 7.26/69/70 (baseline CO2 55). He was placed on BiPAP
[**1-14**] for 4h and given solumedrol 125mg x2, lasix 20 x1,levaquin
500 IV. CXR there was without any change.
.
ROS: negative for fevers, chills, chest pain, n/v/abd
pain/diarrhea, dysuria. At baseline, can only walk 15 feet
before getting dyspneic.
.
On arrival to [**Name (NI) **], pt's initial vitals were: t100.2, p134,
120/58, rr26, 92%RA. He was given additional Levofloxacin 250mg.
He was placed on CPAP without improvement. Pt was noted to have
O2 sats in low 90s. He was intubated after discussion with the
family. Pt was also noted to be hypotensive to the 70s and
started on a neo gtt peripherally. R IJ was placed. Levophed was
added with improvement in BP. Propofol started for sedation. Pt
was noted to have WBC count of 32 and was given vancomycin. Pt
was persistently hypotensive on double pressors and given Tn
[**Last Name (LF) 3564**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] was concerned about PE. CTA was performed and negative
for PE.

EKG: poor baseline. tachycardia (sinus vs. MAT), nl axis/int,
poor R wave progression
.
Imaging:
CXR1: There is marked pulmonary hyperinflation and
"simplification" with diaphragm flattening, indicative of
underlying emphysema, with suggestion of large bulla. The
residual lung parenchyma is unremarkable, and no pneumothorax is
identified. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
limits and
there is no pleural effusion. There is a triangular lucency
projected over the central aspect of the lower thorax, which may
represent air in stomach or bowel loops in the upper abdomen.
.
IMPRESSION: Severe underlying emphysema, with no focal
consolidation or evidence of CHF.
.
CXR2: distal tip of the catheter in the mid
superior vena cava, nearly 9 cm proximal to the cavoatrial
junction.
.
Chest CT: Extensive blebs in lung apex; diffuse emphysematous
disease. Scattered tiny nodules in right upper and middle lobe.
No evidence of PE. Scattered calcified granulomas bilaterally.
.
Echo: IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with mild right
ventricular cavity enlargement but preserved global
biventricular systolic
function.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 64 yo male with PMH severe COPD (FEV1 0.68,
20% predicted) on chronic steroids, HTN, recent vertebral
fractures presents with respiratory failure and shock.
.
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient presented with a COPD
exacerbation, most likely after not having a full recovery from
his last exacerbation 3 weeks prior to admission. He had no
evidence of pulmonary embolus on CT angiogram. Blood cultures
and sputum cultures did not grow microbes and he had negative
viral serology studies, negative legionella antigen, and
negative sputum studies for pneumocystis. The patient was
intubated on arrival to the hospital after discussion with
family members. [**Name (NI) **] was placed on IV solumedrol, standing
nebulizers, as well as antibiotics
(vancomycin/levofloxacin/flagyl). He was llater transitioned to
vancomycin/aztreonam to cover any resistant gram negative
organisms and also had a 5 day course of azithromycin for
atypical pathogens during his stay. He had a significant degree
of "auto-PEEP" devoloping while on the ventilator, and failed
attempts to transition from assist control to pressure support
settings due to PEEP buildup leading to hypotension.
On [**6-6**], the patient self extubated, and initially had normal
mental status and present respiratory drive. However, he quickly
tired, despite the use of non-invasive positive pressure, and
could not maintain adequate ventilation. Through discussions
with the patient and his family, it was agreed that he would be
reintubated but would not like long term intubation/maintenance
on trach. He underwent reintubation and subsequent attempts were
made to adjust ventilator settings to increase his pCO2 so that
he might be able to maintain adequate ventilation after
extubation. These attempts were not successful. He was
maintained on steroids and antibiotics during this time. On [**6-10**]
through extensive discussions with wife [**Name (NI) 382**] and children, it
was determined that the patient would have CMO status. He was
extubated and expired on [**6-10**] at 21:30 due to respiratory
failure.
.
2. Hypotension: The patient was admitted with hypotension which
was thought most likely related to his high levels of auto-PEEP
compromising his cardiac output. Sepsis was also in the
differential although no source was identified. He initially
required two pressors but through gradual adjustments of
ventilator settings to reduce PEEP, antibiotic treatment, fluids
as tolerated, and adjustments in his sedation regimen from
fentanyl/versed to propofol, his hypotension resolved and he was
weaned off pressors.

3. Prophylaxis: The patient was prophylaxed with protonix, sc
heparin.
.
4. Nutrition:: The patient's nutrition was maintained with tube
feeding
.
5. Code status: The patient's code status was discussed with
family throughout his stay as detailed above.
