Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy
Central Line Placement


History of Present Illness:
This is a 84 y/o with h/o ESRD, A fib, who comes to the
Emergency Department after being found on HD with increasing
shortness of breath. Patient found to be 10L positive, but they
were unable to take enough fluid off so they took off 2L.
Patient describes that over the last few weeks, she has been
feeling a little more short of breath. She reports one "big
pillow" orthopnea and cannot lie flat due to shortness of
breath. No PND. Pt is non-ambulatory so it is difficult to tell
how far she can walk before getting SOB.
She denies any fever, cough, diarrhea, chest pain, chills,
nausea, vomit. Of note, pt was recently admitted for debridement
of her heel ulcers. Also, of note, pt recently had a PMIBI that
was negative for ischemia and showed an EF of 60%.

7. Asthma
8. GERD
9. Hypertension
10. PVD/Heel Ulcers - refusing angio
11. C.Diff [**8-10**] treated with Flagyl. C.Diff positive on [**9-19**] at

nursing home.
12. Poor PO Intake

14. Low Phos, Mag, and Potassium
15. b/l non-healing heel ulcers
16. Ischemic left leg


Social History:
Pt currently lives at rehab center but prior to fracture lived
alone in [**Location (un) 86**] with a house cleaner who comes several times a
week to clean her house. Pt reports quiting smoking 8 years ago.
However, the patient does have a 60+ pack year history of
smoking. Pt has occasional alcohol use.

trach in place.
Face with some baseline asymmetry but elevates symetrically for
smile, brow raise.
RUE still edemetous but HD fistula working, decreased
tenderness, appearance c/w lymphedema of arm.

Pertinent Results:
[**2161-10-20**]
MIBI: IMPRESSION: 1. Normal myocardial perfusion. 2. Normal left
ventricular cavity size and function. LVEF of 60%.
.
[**2161-11-21**]
LEFT DECUBITUS AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPHS: Again seen is a
left-sided PICC line terminating in the SVC. Large left pleural
effusion with associated atelectasis is again seen. A small
right-sided pleural effusion and associated atelectasis is seen.
Osseous structures remain unstable. Note is made of a calcified
aorta. Heart and mediastinal contours cannot be adequately
evaluated secondary to the pleural effusion.
IMPRESSION:
1. Large left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis.
2. Small right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis
.
[**2161-11-21**] ultrasound negative for DVT RUE
.
CT HEAD: IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Probable thick secretions within the posterior nasopharynx.
Clinically correlate.

.
CXR [**2161-12-9**]:
INDICATION: Tube placement.
There has been interval placement of a tracheostomy tube, which
terminates at approximately the level of the thoracic inlet. The
cuff appears slightly wider than the adjacent tracheal lumen
suggesting mild overdistention. There is no evidence of
pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax, and there has otherwise been
no significant interval change in appearance of the chest with
the exception of the tube placement compared to the prior study
of one day earlier.
.
ECHO [**11-24**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The
right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. [Intrinsic right ventricular
systolic function may be more depressed given the severity of
tricuspid regurgitation.] The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
[**2162-11-24**] CTA CHEST:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism, retroperitoneal
hemorrhage, or intra- abdominal abscess.
2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions unchanged from the prior
study. Small pericardial effusion, and small amount of ascites
fluid. Findings are consistent with anasarca.
3. Heavy coronary and aortic calcifications.
4. Atrophic kidneys with bilateral cysts, consistent with
end-stage renal disease. Some low-density lesions of the kidneys
are not fully characterized.

Brief Hospital Course:
OVERVIEW:  This is a 84 y/o female with h/o ESRD on HD, PAF on
anticoagulation who came in with increasing shortness of breath
and a new pleural effusion.
.
# Shortness of Breath:  The patient developed shortness of
breath prior to transfer to the medical ICU.  On transfer, she
was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.  The
differential diagnosis of this SOB included cardiac causes (MI,
worseing CHF), and pulmonary (pna, pleural effusion, COPD).  EKG
showed no acute changes and enzymes ruled her out for MI.  BNP
was [**Numeric Identifier 4244**], suggesting CHF, but Echocardiogram revealed EF 50-55%
MR1+, TR 2+.  She did not appear grossly volume overloaded and
HD was continued, though it was occasionally suboptimal due to
hypotension.  Pleural effu
