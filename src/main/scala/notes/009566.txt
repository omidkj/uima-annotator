CXR [**2174-8-29**]
The apparent new haziness at the bases may represent fluid
within the major fissures, especially on the left. Infiltrate in
the right middle or lower lobe may account for the appearances
on the right where there is no obvious pleural effusion seen
otherwise.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) hypotension, bradycardia - This was likely multifactorial due
to the combination of amiodarone, digoxin, bethanechol, and
carvedilol. These medications were all held, and her pulse
improved to the 60's and BP to the low 100's. Captopril was
added back and slowly titrated as tolerated given its benefit in
heart failure. It was considered to put a biventricular
pacemaker to help with symptoms, but this decision was deferred
to the outpatient setting as she improved on medical management
alone.

2) atrial fibrillation - The patient was in slow A. fib per EKG
when admitted. Her coumadin was held for two days as she was
being evaluated for pacemaker placement, but then restarted at
4-5 mg PO, which will be changed to 2.5 mg PO as an outpatient.
She will likely need more after her levofloxacin course is
finished, as her amiodarone was discontinued. Her INR will be
followed as an outpaitient, and was therapeutic at discharge.

3) digoxin toxicity - her digoxin level was 3.2 at the outside
hospital. Therapeutic for this patient was likely closer to
0.8-1.0. Her digoxin was held during hospitalization, and can be
restarted as an outpatient if it is felt that this medication
will be of benefit to this patient.

4) congestive heart failure - The patient has a history of
idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15-20%. She
appered hypovolemic at presentation, and was rehydrated with
small boluses of normal saline until she was euvolemic. Her neck
veins were never distended during hospitalization. She was
discharged per CHF guidelines.

5) anorexia - The patient has a history of 25 pound weight loss
over the last few months. Her husband reports that she has not
had much appetite. It was considered that the amiodarone could
partially be contributing to her anorexia. An albumin level
showed that she was mildly malnourished, and a nutrition consult
was obtained. She was started on Megace with some improvment in
her eating, and will follow up with nutrition as an outpatient.

6) delirium - On multiple occasions, she became combative and
agitated, insulting the staff and stating that she wanted to go
home. She was given zyprexa for these episodes, and haldol on
one occastion. The social worker and psychiatry staff were both
consulted to evaluate her. Psychiatry was consulted for
evaluation of insight and judgment, and found the patient not
able to make her own decisions. A sitter was obtained for her. A
delerium workup was done which showed a positive UA. She was
treated for this UA, with marked resolution of her mental status
once she was started on bactrim.

7) urinary tract infection - A UA was obtained on HD#2 and was
positive. She was completely asymptomatic but was treated
empirically with levofloxacin. Final culture showed Klebsiella
pneumoniae, resistant to levofloxacin. The patient had an
allergy to penicillins and bactrim, so ID was consulted who
recommended giving bactrim as the allergy history was
questionable. She received two doses of bactrim without any
reaction and was discharged on a 7 day total course.

8) urinary incontinence - the patient had a foley catheter
during the first two days of hospitalization. When this was
d/c'd, the patient became incontinent of bladder. Her bethanchol
was restarted, as this was felt not to contribut significantly
to her bradycardia.

9) hypercholesterolemia - her statin was continued.

10) DNR/DNI - The patient's husband stated that she wanted to be
DNR per a discussion when she was admitted to the OSH. She
stated during the hospitalization that she "wanted to go home to
die". A palliative care consult visit can be done as an
outpatient.

11) Coordination of care - a family meeting was conducted toward
the end of hospitalization to coordinate goals of care.
