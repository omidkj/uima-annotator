Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
NSTEMI at OSH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with bare metal stent to proximal left
anterior descending artery


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 83 yo woman with h/o CAD s/o CABG in [**2150**],
Hyperlipidemia, DM2, and hypertension, who presented from OSH
with NSTEMI.  Per the patient and her family, the patient
developed shortness of breath, a productive cough, and
increasing pain in her left arm last Tuesday.  She presented to
[**Hospital3 **] ED, where she was found to have a right lower lobe
infiltrate and was admitted for pneumonia.  She was started on
Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin, yet continued to spike daily
fevers, so Vancomycin was added on [**6-5**].  She admitted to
increasing PND, orthopnea, and ankle edema over the past 6
months, so cardiology was consulted given concern for underlying
CHF given her history of CAD.  She had a TTE on [**6-4**], which
showed concentric LVH with mild anteroseptal hyokinesis and 2+
MR.

On [**6-5**], the patient had an episode of [**6-4**], non-radiating,
substernal chest pressure, which she states was reminiscent of
the pain she experienced with her prior MI in [**2150**].  She had
associated dizziness and diaphoresis.  ECG showed ST depressions
in II, III, and AVF as well as V4-V6.  Cardiac enzymes were
found to be elevated, so the patient was trasnferred to the CCU
and started on [**Year (4 digits) **], Heparin gtt, [**Year (4 digits) **], and Integrilin.  She
had a stat repeat TTE, which showed global hypokinesis and a
LVEF of 40%.  She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization.

On arrival to [**Wardname 13764**], the patient developed acute respiratory
distress with O2 sats in the 80s.  She received albuterol
nebulizations x3, Atrovent x1, Lasix 40 mg IV, and was placed on
a NRB.  She was then transferred to the CCU for further
evaluation and monitoring.

In the CCU, the patient denies current chest pain and states
that her breathing has improved.  She continues to have a
productive cough but feels more comfortable than prior.

On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent chills or rigors. She
denies exertional buttock or calf pain. She does endorse
frequent constipation.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

PERTINENT STUDIES:
EKG (OSH on [**6-5**]):  ST depressions in II, III, AVF, V4-V6.

CXR (OSH on [**6-5**]):  Right lower lobe infiltrate is essentially
unchanged when compared to previous examination.  The degree of
cardiac silhouette enlargement s/o median sternotomy is
unchanged.  The left lung and pulmonary venous pattern have a
normal appearance.  No pleural effusions seen.

TTE ([**6-4**]):  Concentric LVH with mild anteroseptal hypokinesis.
LVEF 50%.  Trivial aortic stenosis ([**Location (un) 109**] 1.9 cm), 2+ MR.  3+ TR.


STAT TTE ([**6-6**]):  LVEF 40%, Global hypokinesis.  Inferior wall
hypokinesis v. akinesis.  4+ MR.

CXR ([**6-6**]): RLL infiltrate, bilateral pleural effusions and
pulmonary edema.

Cardiac Cath ([**6-7**]):
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated three vessel disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically
apparent disease.  The LAD had a large clot in the proximal
vessel which
supplied a moderate sized diagonal.  There was 70% mid-LAD
stenosis
proximal to the SVG-LAD touchdown and after the diagonal
takeoff, as
well as mild disease of the distal vessel.  The LCx had a 50%
occlusion
at theorigin and OM1 and OM2 were 100% occluded.  The native LCx
only
fills a small OM4.  The distal AVG Cx is 100% occluded.  The mid
RCA had
100% occlusion.
2. Conduit angiography revealed the SVG-OM and SVG-Ramus to be
totally
occluded.  The SVG to LAD and the SVG to RCA were widely patent.

3. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right sided filling
pressure
with RVEDP 18mmHg.  There was moderate pulmonary arterial
systolic
hypertension with PASP of 42mmHg.  The CI was preserved at 2.5
L/min/m2.
4. Successful thrombectomy (using Angiojet) of a large thrombus
burden
in the proximal LAD followed by PTCA and stenting with a 3.5x18
mm
Driver BMS with improvement in distal flow (into a moderate size
diag,
otehr smaller branches) from TIMI 1 to TIMI 3. Final angiography
showed
no residual stenosis, dissection or distal emboli.

Echo ([**6-8**]):  The left atrium is elongated. The right atrial
pressure is indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with anterior akinesis/hypokinesis with mild to
moderate hypokinesis elsewhere. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The end-diastolic
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Renal US with Dopplers([**6-10**]): 1. Atrophic left kidney with
cortical thinning. No hydronephrosis bilaterally. 2. Some
vascularity detected in the right kidney, but pulse wave Doppler
ultrasound cannot be performed on this person, as she is unable
to lie flat and unable to hold her breath. Doppler cannot be
performed on a continual moving target.

CXR ([**6-12**]): In comparison with the study of [**6-10**], there has been
substantial decrease in the pulmonary vascular congestion.
Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged. The right-sided pleural
effusion has decreased. The area of possible consolidation in
the right perihilar region is no longer seen, consistent with it
having been a reflection
