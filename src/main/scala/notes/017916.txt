CT CSpine: No evidence of cervical spine fracture. Cervical
spondylosis as described above.
CXR post CVL placement [**7-25**]:
A left subclavian vascular catheter terminates in the superior
vena cava. Several skin folds are present in the left hemithorax
but there is no pneumothorax. There are bilateral moderate
pleural effusions, both of which have increased in size since
the previous study. New perihilar and basilar opacities may
reflect pulmonary edema sparing the upper lobes in the setting
of emphysema, but it is difficult to exclude underlying
aspiration or infectious pneumonia in the lung bases. Surgical
clips are present in the left axilla.

[**7-27**] CXR: Interval development of large left pneumothorax with
almost complete collapse of the left lung.


Brief Hospital Course:
79F w/ a multiple medical problems including CHF (EF20%), COPD
(on home O2), found down at home, pulseless- CPR initiated
w/conciousness regained on scene. At OSH ABG 7.19/94/110, BiPAP
started. Pt found to be hypothermic w/ WBC 17 (pt on steroids)
pnuemobilia and thickening of sigmoid. Pt was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management with wishes from the pt and family
to reverse DNR/DNI status if surgery was indicated.  On
transfer, the pt had VSS with a mildly tender abdomen without
peritoneal signs.  It was decided to treat her conservatively
with bowel and IV antibiotics.  She improved and was tolerating
PO's without difficulty after passing a swallow study.  Her
Cpine was clearly with both a negative CT Cspine and clinical
exam.  Her groin CVL was DC'd after a L SC SVL was palced.  CXR
confirmed good position and no PTx.

Overnight on HD 3, pt became mildly agitated and an ABG was
drawn which showed a severe resp acidosis and BiPAP was
initiated. The pt subsequently developed severe hypoxia with
hypotension.  A CXR was obtained which showed complete collapse
of the L lung thought to be a result of bursting a bleb
associated with her severe COPD.  Family did not want a chest
tube placed and decided to make the pt [**Name (NI) 3225**] measures.

On HD 4 pt continued to show a severe respiratory acidosis, was
continued on a morphine drip, and was difficult to arouse.  At
6pm pt's respiratory status worsened and she died.
