Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Unresponsive.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.

History of Present Illness:
The pt. is a 20 year-old male who was found unresponsive in his
friend's dorm room.  Per EMS report, the pt. was found at 7:00am
on the day of admission unresponsive and with "poor respiratory
effort" and also evidence of emesis in his airway.  The pt. was
given narcan without response was and intubated in the field and
transported to [**Hospital1 18**]. EMS spoke with a friend of pt's. who last
spoke with him at approx. 3am the morning of admission amd was
unable to wake him at 7am.  The pt's. friend did not know of any
trauma.  Per EMS reports, there was evidence of drug
paraphenalia in the room.

On arrival to the ED, he was agitated and therefore placed on a
propofol drip. He remained on mechanical ventilation (AC mode).
His initial vital signs were: BP: 178/60, P: 110 RR: 18 SaO2:
97% on AC 600x14, PEEP 5, FiO2 100%. The propofol drip was
weaned when the pt's. systolic blood pressure dropped to the
80's.  Subsequently, a versed drip was begun for sedation, and
the pt. was given IV fluid and a levophed drip was begun for
blood pressure support (with effect as SBP up to 100's).  The
pt. was also given metronidazole, levofloxacin, and vancomycin
for presumed aspiration pneumonia.

On presentation to the MICU, the pt. was intubated and sedated.
Per the pt's mother, he had been in his USOH and had not been
acting strangely as of late.

Past Medical History:
None.


Social History:
The pt. smokes approximately [**2-5**] pack of cigarettes per day (x
4years). Occasional known EtOH use.  Per pt's. friend, pt. is
known IV heroin abuser.  He is a student at [**University/College 23925**] College.
He lives at home with his parents.  He emigrated from [**Country 532**] 7
years ago.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course:

1. Respiratory failure: Determined to be secondary to
respiratory depression from heroin overdose and an aspiration
event.  As stated above, the pt. was intubated in the field for
airway protection.  He remained intubated and sedated for the
first four days of his MICU stay, during which time he was
enrolled in the ARDS protocol. He was successfully extubated on
the fourth hospital day without incident and remained stable
from a respiratory standpoint from that point onward.  He was
treated with a seven day course of levofloxacin and
metronidazole for aspriation pneumonia.

2. Hypotension: Determined to be secondary to propofol use.  He
was initially treated with aggressive IV fluids and levophed.
The pressor was able to be weaned off shortly after arrival to
the MICU.  He remained hemodynamically stable for the duration
of the hospital stay.

3. Acute Renal Failure: Determined to be prerenal azotemia
secondary to hypoperfusion, improved after aggressive fluid
resuscitation.

4. Cardiomyopathy: A TTE with bubble study was performed on the
first hospital day after the pt. became acutely hypoxic and
there was concern for the presence of a shunt.  The echo
revealed the following:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast without. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction 20-30
percent). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is no
pericardial effusion.
The cardiomyopathy was felt to be secondary to "stunned
myocardium" as a result of transient hypoperfusion and ischemic
insult.  A repeat echo was performed on [**2135-1-24**] which showed
normal biventricular systolic function with an LVEF of 55%.

5. Transaminitis: His ALT and AST were elevated while in the ICU
but trended down during the course of the admission. This was
thought secondary to hypoperfusion.  His hepatitis serologies
were all negative.

He was transferred to the floor on [**2135-1-24**], and where he was
continued on levaquin/flagyl for aspiration pneumonia.  His
blood cultures from [**2134-2-22**] grew [**2-7**] Gram positive cocci which
was thought to be a contaminant.  He was followed by social
work.  He refused formal drug rehabilitation but agreed to seek
drug counseling available at his college.  He denied suicidality
or intentional self harm. He was discharged to home with
arrangement for outpatient PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 4939**].
