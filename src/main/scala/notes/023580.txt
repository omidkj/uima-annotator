Allergies:
Bactrim Ds / Hurricaine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2641**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Removal of screws from left foot from previous fusion.


History of Present Illness:
The pt. is a 60 year-old female with multiple medical problems
who was recently admitted from [**2121-10-28**] to [**2121-11-13**] for repair of a charcot foot complicated by respiratory
distress, subsequent wound infection and a long hospitalization.
 She was discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with a PICC line for
long-term antibiotics.  She did well during her first two days
at the rehab facility but developed a fever to 104 degrees and
there was also concern over a "drug rash."

In the ED, the pt. was noted to have a temperature of 100.3
degrees rectally.
Her initial blood pressure was 150/85, however it suddently
dropped to 70's systolic.  This prompted insertion of a femoral
line and the administration of 4 liters of normal saline.  The
pt. also required levophed for blood pressure support.  She was
placed on three liters of oxygen via nasal cannula and was
somnolent but following commands and maintaining her airway.
She was empirically started on unasyn, vancomycin and
levofloxacin.  She was also given one unit of packed red blood
cells for a low hematocrit.  She was noted to have T-wave
inversions in the lateral leads.  Her cardiac enzymes were drawn
and were not suggestive of acute myocardial infarction.  She was
admitted to the MICU for possible sepsis.

Brief Hospital Course:
MICU Course:

1. ? Septic Shock:  The pt. was admitted with a presumptive
diagnosis of sepsis (the source was initially thought to be
secondary to pneumonia vs PICC line infection vs heal ulcer).
Levophed was quickly weaned off over the first night that the
patient spent in the MICU.  A TEE was performed on [**11-17**] that
was negative for endocarditis or abscess. The pt was
pan-cultured, including PICC and femoral line tips, but nothing
grew out. She was maintained on zosyn and levofloxacin. [**Month/Year (2) **]
did not feel that the screws in her L foot were a likely source
for continued infection.  A cortisol level was low, so
hydrocortisone and fludricortisone were started for adrenal
insufficiency in the face of her critical illness. The steroids
were subsequently weaned off shortly after transfer to the
floor.

2. Acute methemoglobinemia:  During the TEE procedure (on
[**11-17**]), hurricaine spray triggered an episode of
methemoglobinemia, with MetHb 58% on ABG done at the time.
Methylene Blue was administered with rapid clinical response and
resolution of cyanosis. Further ABGs after administration of
methylene blue revealed MetHb 7% shortly thereafter and later
down to 1%. Hurricaine Spray was added to the list of allergies.


In addition, the pt. was treated for her diabetes mellitus,
coronary artery disease, and pulmonary disease (?pulmonary
fibrosis and obstructive sleep apnea) during her six day MICU
course.  On [**2121-11-20**], the pt. was transferred to the floor.  She
was treated for the following issues:

1. Left foot infection/possible osteomyelitis: The pt. had the
hardware removed by the [**Date Range **] service on hospital day #7.  In
addition, necrotic bone and surrounding soft tissue was also
debrided at the time.  An Xray of the pt's. foot was performed
which did not show definite evidence of osteomyelitis.  A VAC
dressing was placed in the wound with instructions for q3day
dressing changes.

The pt. was maintained on vancomycin and zosyn during the
hospital stay and will be on this course of antibiotics until
such time as her wound fully granulates in.  It is expected that
this will take approximately six weeks post-discharge.  The pt.
was scheduled for a follow-up appointment with [**Date Range **] for one
week after discharge.

2. Type 2 diabetes mellitus: The pt. was noted to have good
glycemic control during the hospital stay on a sliding scale of
regular insulin.  Her usual dose of glipizide was added prior to
discharge.

3. Coronary artery disease: The pt. was chest-pain free for the
duration of the hospital stay.  She was maintained on aspirin, a
beta blocker, a statin and an ACE inhibitor.

4. Hyponatremia: The pt. was noted to have serum sodium of
128-133 over the course of the hospital stay.  The pt's. serum
sodium is noted to be between 130-133 at baseline.  A strict one
liter fluid restriction was instituted with some effect in
maintaining the serum sodium in the range of 131-135.  This
fluid restriction should be maintained i
