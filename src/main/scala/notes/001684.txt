HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old
male with a past medical history significant for obstructive
sleep apnea on C-PAP, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
DDD pacemaker, right lower lobectomy, orthostatic hypotension
and depression, who initially presented to [**Hospital3 **]
status post overdose with Klonopin and Amitriptyline in an
attempted suicide after argument with wife on [**12-31**].  [**Name2 (NI) **] had
been emergently intubated and placed in the Intensive Care
Unit there.  The patient was found to have pulmonary
infiltrates suspicious for aspiration pneumonia and was
febrile and then started on Clindamycin and Ciprofloxacin.
While there in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient
self-extubated himself and was later re-intubated emergently.


On [**1-5**], the patient was then transferred here at [**Hospital1 1444**] due to difficulty weaning and
possible tracheostomy placement.  Here in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], he again
self-extubated himself.  He was placed on C-PAP and now
weaned down to two liters nasal cannula O2 which is his home
O2 requirement.

He was transferred out of the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to the [**Company 191**] Medicine
Service to be evaluated by Psychiatry and likely to be
transferred to inpatient psychiatry service after medically
stable condition.

Here in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient is currently stable without
complaints.  He does not wish to go back to home with wife.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 68 year old
male status post drug overdose and aspiration, now stable for
transfer from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] to the Medical Floor status post
extubation.  The patient is being treated for his aspiration
pneumonia with Levofloxacin for a seven day total, of which
his course is already finished and Clindamycin for a ten day
course total.  The patient also has a history of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and obstructive sleep apnea on
C-PAP at 12 mm HG at night which was continued while in
hospital.  The patient was transitioned from nebulizer to
Combivent and Flovent MDI.  While on the medical floor, the
patient was afebrile with normal blood count, in stable
respiratory condition status post extubation in the Intensive
Care Unit.  The patient was maintained at his home O2
requirement of two liters by nasal cannula.

The patient was evaluated by Psychiatry while in hospital.
The patient was continued on one-to-one sitter observation
due to having limited insight into his actions and remaining
at risk for self-harm.  His delirium was resolved while in
hospital.  Psychiatry recommended acute level of psychiatric
care and facilitated transfer to Psychiatric inpatient
setting.  Psychiatric medications for now were held off.

The patient is medically stable for transfer to inpatient
Psychiatric facility as evidenced by resolved delirium,
stable laboratory data and resolving pneumonia being treated
with antibiotics.
