Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 562**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation [**2115-8-27**]
Central line placement [**2115-8-27**]
Temporary dialysis catheter placement left groin [**2115-8-27**]
Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
Ms.[**Known lastname **] is a 69 yo female with MMP including [**Known lastname 2182**], ESRD on HD
3X/week, CAD, CHF, HIV, eosinophilic pna, and recently diagnosed
right popliteal DVT without PE on coumadin, who presents from
home with a 1-day history of worsening shortness of breath
following missed hemodialysis yesterday [**2-20**] clotted AV graft.

She describes that she woke up last night with SOB, with some
relief with sitting upright. She describes transient chest
tightness in AM relieved with SLNG X1. No N/V. No pleuritic
discomfort. No diaphoresis. Chronic non-productive cough,
without change. No fever or chills. Some wheezing, not
significantly worse versus usual. No lower extremity edema. She
has been compliant with her medications and low salt diet. Her
last hemodialysis was on [**8-23**]. HD was attempted yesterday
without success [**2-20**] clotted AV graft. She was scheduled for left
UE AV graft thrombectomy today, but presented to the ED with
SOB.

In the ED, initial vitals were T 98.6, HR 102, BP 140/100, RR
32, Sat 93% on room air. Labs remarkable for INR 6.8 (was 5.2
yesterday, Coumadin held last night). Right EJ line placed.
Given elevated INR, transfusion of FFP as initiated, with
subsequent increasing oxygen requirement and eventual sat 91 %
on NRB. She was placed on BiPAP 5/5 with FiO2 0.1, with sat 95%.
MICU admission requested.

Review of labs indicates supratherapeutic INR on multiple
occasions.

IMAGING:
[**2115-8-27**] CXR: Mild CHF. Blunting of right CPA.
[**2115-8-27**] CXR: INDICATIONS: Hypoxia, increasing shortness of
breath.
PORTABLE AP CHEST AT 1610: Comparison is made to the study from
six hours earlier. Heart size remains at the upper limits of
normal. There is minimal pulmonary, vascular engorgement, but
overall, the appearance is improved since the study from six
hours earlier. There are no focal consolidations.
[**2115-8-31**] CXR: Triangular opacity in the right suprahilar lung is
probably atelectasis. Lungs are clear otherwise. Small bilateral
pleural effusions layer posteriorly. Mild cardiomegaly,
unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. There is no retrosternal
hematoma or displaced rib fracture. Configuration of the chest
suggests [**Month/Day/Year 2182**].
EKG on admission: Rate 96 [**Doctor First Name **], regular. Normal axis, normal
intervals. LAA. LVH by voltage criteria. Q in III (old),
non-specific ST changes in anterior leads (old versus
[**2115-7-24**])
EKG on discharge: Sinus rhythm
Lateral ST changes are nonspecific
Since previous tracing of [**2115-8-30**], no significant change

********************

Relevant studies in hospital:
[**2115-8-29**] ECHO: LVEF low normal (LVEF 50%) secondary to
hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. No AR, no AS. (2+) MR, (2+) TR. Moderate
pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo female with MMP including ESRD on HD, CAD, CHF, severe MR,
and [**Month/Day/Year 2182**], admitted with SOB in setting of missed HD [**2-20**] clotted
AV graft, as well as supratherapeutic INR.

Transfusion of FFP was initiated in the ED to reverse her
coagulopathy and plan for temporary hemodialysis catheter
placement. Unfortunately, she developed worsening hypoxemia with
volume administration, and was placed on BiPAP and admitted to
the ICU for volume overload and respiratory distress. In the
ICU, she developed worsening respiratory distress, and was
intubated emergently on [**2115-8-27**] at 20:10, with succinylcholine
administration for induction. Shortly after intubation, she went
into PEA arrest.

1) PEA arrest: Etiology of PEA arrest attributed to
hyperkalemia, with exacerbation following succinylcholine
administration. She was resuscitated according to the ACLS
algorithms for PEA/asystole/pulseless VT, shocked twice (200
joules and 360 joules)and concomitantly repeatedly treated for
hyperkalemia. Potassium during code 6.9, after therapy. She
recovered a perfusing normal sinus rhythm after about 30 minutes
of resuscitation. EKG post code unchanged. She was started on a
dopamine drip for hypotension, which was slowly weaned off on
[**8-29**]. An echo was obtained on [**8-29**], which revealed a stable EF
at 50%, 2+ MR (improved versus [**6-/2115**]) and moderate PA HTN
(old). She was transferred from the ICU to the floor and
remained hemodynamically stable with no neurologic deficits.
Significant pain in chest from chest compressions, but chest
x-ray after code showed no evidence of PNX, hemothorax, rib
fracture.  Supportive management with Dilaudid PO and oxycontin.
Of note, previous bleeding with Ibuprofen (history of acquired
factor VII deficiency, s/p Rx). Avoided Tylenol [**2-20**]
transaminitis.  Electrolytes were monitored and she received HD
QOD.
2) Respiratory failure: Attributed to fluid overload in the
setting of missed hemodialysis [**2-20**] clotted AV graft and fluid
administration +/- [**Month/Day (2) 2182**]. She was 4 kg above dry weight at the
time of admission to the ICU. She was initial
