Pertinent Results:
[**2192-11-6**] Chest CT
1. Small right pleural effusion, free of mass or hematoma,
layers posteriorly, following right thoracotomy and pleural
drainage of previously large right pleural effusion. Large
consolidative areas in the previously collapsed right middle and
lower lobes probably due to atelectasis, though pneumonia and
pulmonary hemorrhage cannot be excluded.
2. Small pericardial or pseudopericardial effusion present
following presumed pericardiectomy. No mediastinal hematoma.
3. Moderate to large left pleural effusion increased with more
left lower lobe atelectasis. Increased ascites.

[**2192-11-1**] ECHO
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. No spontaneous
echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No mass/thrombus is seen in the left
atrium or left atrial appendage.
2. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the
right atrium. No thrombus is seen in the right atrial appendage
3. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
4. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
5. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
6. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
7. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is minimal excusion of
the RCC. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with
minimal aortic valve stenosis. Moderate (2+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
8. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
9. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. The
pericardium may be thickened. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade. There is no evidence of pericardial
constriction. The pulmonary vein flow pattern shows no systolic
blunting and no A wave increase. There is minimal repiratory
change in both the tricuspid and mitral inflow patterns.
10. There are large bilateral pleural effusions.
11. There is a large amount of abdominal ascites.
12. Post pericardiectomy, there is fluid in the pericardial
space. Biventricular systolic function is normal. MR is trace.
AI is 2+.

[**2192-11-8**] Chest X-Ray
During the short time interval, increase in left pleural
effusion is demonstrated although mild. There is no change in
the right basilar consolidations with increase in the left
pericardiac opacities suggesting a combination of atelectasis
and pleural effusion. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
stable. Minimal right apical pneumothorax is present.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2192-11-1**] for surgical
management of his constrictive pericarditis. He was taken to the
operating room where he underwent a right VATS followed by a
pericardiectomy via a sternotomy. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively he was transferred to the intensive
care unit for monitoring. Albumin and aggressive diuresis were
used to prevent further third spacing of fluids. As he had large
amounts of secretions, he remained initially intubated. On
postoperative day three he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. The physical therapy service was consulted for
assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. The
hepatology service followed him daily for assistance with his
care. On postoperative day five, he was transferred to the step
down unit for further recovery. He developed a left pleural
effusion which required thoracentesis. 1300cc of serous fluid
were removed without incident. The wound care specialist was
consulted for assistance with a sacral/coccyx pressure ulcer.
Wound cleansing was recommended with Allevyn foam dressing
changes. An attempt to drain his ascites was made on [**2192-11-9**]
however was unsuccessful for only 5cc's. Intravenous albumin and
lasix were used to reduce the volume of ascites. Mr. [**Known lastname 1968**]
continued to make steady progress and was discharged home on
postoperative day nine. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the
hepatology service, the thoracic surgery service, his
cardiologist and his primary care provider as an outpatient.
