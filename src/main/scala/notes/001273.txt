History of Present Illness:
58yo M with a stage III non-small-cell lung cancer diagnosed
over a year
ago.  He was treated with chemoradiation therapy and was
documented to have persistent nodal disease in the mediastinum.
He therefore was treated to a definitive dose of radiation
therapy. However, he had persistent FDG avid disease in the lung
and after lengthy discussion, he was brought to the operating
room today for attempted pulmonary resection.  Before the
operation, we met on several occasions and discussed both the
conduct and risks of the operation.  He was well aware of the
risks including respiratory failure, pneumonia, inability to
completely resect the tumor, bronchopleural fistula and
death.

Imaging:
[**2172-11-9**] CT Chest:
IMPRESSION:

1. Peristent postoperative right middle lobe atelectasis. No
evidence of
right middle lobe torsion. The middle lobe bronchus is occluded,
but the
right middle lobe pulmonary artery and draining vein are intact.
The findings
thus most likely reflect mucus impaction.

2. Postoperative changes in the right hemithorax, including
nonhemorrhagic
layering pleural fluid, additional fluid interposed between the
superior
segments of the right lower lobe and the mediastinum, and a
small right apical
pneumothorax. The upper lobe bronchial stump is unremarkable.
Two chest
tubes, one anterior and one posterior, are in expected position.


3. Moderate emphysema.

[**2172-11-10**] CXR
There are two chest tubes seen on the right side with each one
ending near the right lung apex. The right mid lung opacity
representing an
unresolved collapsed right middle lobe is unchanged. There are
no new
opacities which are of concern. Endotracheal tube terminates
approximately
4.7 cm above the carina and is adequately placed. Gastric tube
is seen to
course through the diaphragm into the stomach and is appropriate
in position.
Small right apical pneumothorax is unchanged. Overall, no
interval relevant
changes.

[**2172-11-15**] CXR :
Overall appearance of the chest is stable with minimal residual
subcutaneous emphysema in the right lateral soft tissues. A tiny
amount of residual air within the surgical bed at the right apex
in this patient status post right upper lobectomy. No focal
airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia. No
pulmonary edema or pleural effusions. Slight nodularity of the
right lateral pleura particularly at the base is likely
postoperative in etiology.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the thoracic surgery service on
[**2172-11-6**] after he underwent a thoracotomy and RUL lobectomy.

Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient had an epidural with good
effect but with some hypotension and adequate pain control. When
tolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to oral
pain medications.

CV: The patient was initially hypotensive to the SBPs 80s
immediately post-op and he was placed on neo up to 0.5mcg. He
was monitored in the PACU overnight and was stable to be
transferred to the floor on POD1. On the floor, his BPs have
remained stable off neo but he was placed again on the neo when
he was intubated and sedated in the SICU. Once transferred to
the floor again, he remained off all pressors. Vital signs were
routinely monitored.

Pulmonary: The patient was initially stable from a pulmonary
point of view post-op. His post-op CXR showed RML collapse but
aerated RLL. However, on POD 2 on the floor, the patient began
to desat to mid 80s on room air. A CXR was obtained and showed
RML as well as RLL collapse. He was transferred to the SICU on
[**2172-11-8**] to undergo a bronchoscopy with BAL, which was sent for
studies. For the bronch, he was intubated and sedated. He had a
repeat bronch on [**2172-11-9**] and [**2172-11-10**] AM and suctioned out more
mucous from his RLL and RML. He was stable from a pulmonary
standpoint thereafter and extubated on [**2172-11-10**] after CXR showed
good stable RLL. His CT was placed to waterseal on [**11-10**] and
removed on [**11-11**]. Post-pull CXR was stable. He was transferred to
the floor on [**11-12**] and his pulmonary status remained stable,
although with desat to the mid 80s on ambulation. He has not
been anle to wean off of oxygen but his requirements are
decreasing daily.  For that reason he will be sent home with
oxygen at 1-2 liters per minute and can gradually wean off over
time.

GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids. His
diet was advanced when appropriate once extubated in the SICU,
which was tolerated well. He was also started on a bowel regimen
to encourage bowel movement. Foley was removed on [**11-12**]. Intake
and output were closely monitored. His Cr was elevated to 1.6,
FeNa was 0.7%, showing a likely pre-renal etiology. He was
bolus'd w/ 500cc NS two times on [**11-13**] and [**11-15**].

ID: Post-operatively, the patient was not placed on any
antibiotics. However, upon transfer to the SICU, he was started
on vanc, zosyn, and tobra for empiric coverage of HAP. He was
switched to PO augmentin once tolerating PO and due to a rising
Cr.
Cultures only showed respiratory flora but a 10d course of
antibiotics was planned.
The patient's temperature was closely watched for signs of
infection. He had a temperature of 101.3 on [**11-14**] and fever
workup was sent but have so far been negative.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible.

At the time of discharge on [**2172-11-16**] , he was doing well,
afebrile with stable vital signs, tolerating a regular diet,
ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well
controlled. His incision was healing well.
