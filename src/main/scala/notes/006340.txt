History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 4886**] is a 45 year old woman who is transferred for
evaluation of a spinal mass. Patient reports the new onset of

[**2106-3-11**].  Blood culture x 2- NGTD.
[**2106-3-11**].  Urine culture pending.

Imaging:
[**2106-3-11**].  LENI.
IMPRESSION: No deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity.


[**2106-3-10**].  Chest CTA.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Large left lower lobe consolidation and atelectasis,
compatible with pneumonia. Underlying obstructive mass cannot be
excluded in this region, and followup imaging is recommended
once consolidation has been cleared. Small right lower lobe
consolidations compatible with multifocal pneumonia.
3. Moderate upper-zone centrilobular emphysema.

[**2106-3-10**].  Chest x-ray.
FINDINGS: Status post abdominal surgery. As compared to the
pre-operative radiograph, there is now a relatively extensive
left lower lobe atelectasis.  No other relevant changes, notably
no evidence of pneumothorax. Unchanged size of the cardiac
silhouette. No pleural effusions.

[**2106-3-7**].  MRI T and L spine.
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval post-surgical changes from the T9 through T12 level,
with
evacuation of the majority of previously-seen nonenhancing
material within the spinal canal. There is a small residual
peripherally-enhancing intradural collection, posterior to T11,
exerting mild mass effect upon the cord. There is residual cord
deformity and abnormal cord T2-signal. No solid enhancing mass
is present.
Correlation with final pathology results is needed to help
determine the potential etiology of the residual collection.
2. Several small subdural collections within the lumbar spine
with residual nonenhancing complex material, layering
dependently in the thecal sac, likely representing residual
blood products.

[**2106-3-16**].  Arterial dopplers of lower extremities.

FINDINGS: Doppler evaluation was performed of both lower
extremity arterial systems at rest. On the right, the femoral,
popliteal and posterior tibial waveforms are triphasic, at the
dorsalis pedis is monophasic. Similar finding is identified on
the left. The ABI is 1.01 on the right, 1.05 on the left.  Pulse
volume recordings show drop off at the ankle and metatarsal
level.

IMPRESSION: Somewhat difficult to interpret study with fairly
symmetric drop off in pulse volume recordings at both ankles and
metatarsals. Although the posterior tibial waveforms are
triphasic, dorsalis pedis is monophasic bilaterally which
reflect some degree of tibial artery disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, Ms. [**Known lastname 4886**] is a 45 year old female admitted for leg
weakness in setting of intradural hematoma of thoracic spine.
She underwent evacuation of the thrombus during her
hospitalization.  Her post-operative course was complicated by
left lower lobe pneumonia requiring brief ICU stay,
constipation, post-operative pain, and arterial vasospasm of the
feet bilaterally.

T11 intradural thrombus.  Patient presented with leg
weakness/numbness and was found at OSH to have new T11 thrombus
with compression of cord.  She underwent evacuation of the
thrombus on [**2106-3-7**] by neurosurgery. Patient was on coumadin at
home (prior to admission) for cardioembolic stroke but denied
any preceding trauma to her back.  At time of discharge, she had
no strength in her right foot and only at the ability to move
her feet & toes in her left leg.

Pneumonia.  Patient's post-operative course was complicated by
pneumonia.  She was briefly cared for in the SICU.  She was
treated with Cefepime for 7 days which was completed on [**2106-3-17**].
Sputum cultures were positive for strep pneumoniae and h.
influezae.

Pedal arterial vasospasm.  Post-operatively, patient was noted
to have bilateral cold feet with diminished pulses.  The toes on
her right foot were noted to be blue.  She was evaluated by
vascular surgery who felt this was consistent with arterial
vasospasm.  Her toes were warm and well perfused at the time of
discharge without any intervention.  The vascular surgeons
recommended applying nitropaste to her feet in the future if she
were to develop arterial vasospasm again.  She does not need
vascular surgery follow up.

Pain management.  Patient experienced significant post-operative
pain.  She was treated with oxycontin, oxycodone,
cyclobenzaprine, gabapentin, and a dexamethasone taper.

Constipation.  Patient developed post-operative constipation
likely secondary to opioids and post-operative ileus.  She was
managed with an aggressive bowel regimen and her constipation
improved, though she continued to have intermittent abdominal
pain associated with constipation.

Depression/anxiety. Patient was continued on home wellbutrin.

H/o stroke.  History of cerebellar and pontine CVAs in [**12-20**]
felt to be cardioembolic in nature as a result of a PFO.
Patient was on coumadin as outpatient, but this was stopped
given the presence of a thoracic subdural thrombus.

Neurogenic bladder.  Patient developed urinary retent
