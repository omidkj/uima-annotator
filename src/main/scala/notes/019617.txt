Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
increasing shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
MVR/TVRepair

History of Present Illness:
Pt. is a 70 y/o F with insulin dependent DM, h/o IMI '[**17**] s/p
PTCA and stent, pernicious anemia, MVR (porcine valve) in [**2119**],
recently disagnosed pulmonary HTN, who presented to the ED today
with bilateral LE pain and swelling and DOE.  Pt. reports she
has diffuse pain in both legs from her feet to her hips, which
has been present x 1 year, getting worse recently.  Also reports
DOE that is worse when she bends over and exerts herself, which
has gotten worse in the last month, although son reports some
improvement in symptoms with Viagra, which was started several
weeks ago after she was diagnosed with pulm. HTN.
.
Per our records pt had a R tibial plateau fracture 1 year ago,
c/b erosion of lateral condyle by hardwear s/p hardware removal
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 22020**] in [**1-14**], and s/p several episodes of "knee
infection" per pt.  Pt. denies pain centered around knee at
present.  Pt. reports she was recently admitted at [**Hospital 622**]
Medical Center for similar complaints.  Per conversation with
pt's son it seems she had a R heart catheterization there and
was diagnosed with pulmonary HTN, and a pleural effusion was
tapped.  There was some concern for PE per pt's son, he thinks
that this was eventually ruled out but is not sure how.
.
In [**Name (NI) **], pt was found to be 88%RA, 94% 4L NC with CXR with
bilateral pleural effusions and pulm vasc redistribution
consistent with CHF.  Was given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1, morphine 2
mg IV x 2, Ativan 1 mg IV x 2, ASA 81 mg PO x 1, and Kayexylate
30 mg PO x 1 at 2 am for K of 6.0.
.
K on recheck was 5.8, had not stooled -> given 30 mg more
Kayexelate, Ca gluconate.

Past Medical History:
1) Insulin dependent DM x 39 yrs, last hemoglobin A1C here in
[**2123**] of 8
2) H/o silent IMI [**2117**] dxed by EKG and echo s/p cath at [**Hospital1 18**]
with subtotal occlusion of distal L cx s/p PTCA and Crown Stent
3) MVR (porcine valve) in [**2119**]
4) Pernicious anemia on Vitamin B12 replacement
5) h/o R ORIF of right lat tibial plateau fracture in [**2-10**] with
h/o cellulitis of R knee and prox tibia requiring septic
separation of incision [**7-13**]
6) h/o multiple surgeries including amputation of 2 toes on R
foot (for complications of bunion surgery)
7) Pulmonary hypertension
8) ?removal of R knee hardware [**1-14**] -> no d/c summary available
9) Chronic kidney disease with baseline creat 1.3-1.5
10) Last echo [**9-/2118**] with EF 50%, akinesis of inf post wall and
basal inf septum, trace AR, mod to severe MR, tricuspid valve
thickening with tricuspid valve prolapse, mod pulm HTN

Looking through [**Last Name (un) **] notes, pt's family called Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14116**] at
[**Last Name (un) **] and left message that pt was hospitalized in [**State 622**] for
?clot in lung but this could not be verified with pt given
mental status
PCP = [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 22021**] in [**Name (NI) 22022**] [**Name (NI) 622**]

thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate
([**12-10**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. A bioprosthetic mitral
