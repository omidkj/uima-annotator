Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8104**]
Chief Complaint:
Mental status changes.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Femoral line placement (removed [**2149-3-27**])
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 66 yo F with PMHx sig. for asthma, OSA, dCHF, MR,
and bipolar disorder who presents for acute mental status
changes. She had an unwitnessed fall at the [**Location (un) **]
center, found sitting on her buttocks. Per transfer notes, pt
stated that she lost her balance, denied any pain from fall. She
usually ambulated with a walker. At 3PM, she was noted to be
lethargic with occasional jerking movements of both arms. Her
fingers were noted to be cyanotic adn she was placed on O2 2L
NC. O2 sats improved from 90-95%. BP 124/66. HR 102. RR20. Temp
97.9. The nursing home staff felt she was more lethargic than
usual. Family thinks she is slightly off baseline.

Per her sister, she had required intubation three times in the
past for hypoventilation after getting too much oxygen.

In the ED, initial VS were: 98.3 110 136/79 36 98. BS 219. Pt
spiked to T104.8. Exam was sig. for wheezing; pt received
nebulizer treatments. Labs sig. for ARF with creatinine of 1.4
(baseline 0.9), no leukocytosis but mild L shilft. Lactate was
1.6. ABG was 7.44/43/91 on nebulizer. First set of CEs neg.
Lithium level 0.9. U/A suggestived of UTI with >50 WBC, mod
leuk, many bacteria. CXR had suggestion of LLL opacity. CT head
showed no acute intracranial process. CT c-spine showed "severe
degenerative disease with central canal stenosis predispose to
spinal cord injury; consider MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] clinical setting." BCxs
drawn. It was felt she was too tachypneic to safely perform LP.
Pt received ceftriaxone 2 gm for UTI and vanc 1 gm and
levofloxacin 750 mg for pneumonia. During her ED course, SBP
fell to 67/23; levophed was started. Left femoral line placed.
Pt is now on 0.5 of levophed, received 3.4L IVFs.

CT head [**2149-3-26**]: No acute intracranial process.

CT c-spine [**2149-3-26**]:
1. No acute fracture or dislocation.
2. Degenerative change at C3-C4 has progressed from [**2145-5-19**].
3. There is stable central canal stenosis from a combination of
reversal of normal lordosis and prominent posterior osteophytes.
This predisposes this patient to spinal cord injury with minor
trauma. In the appropriate clinical context, consider MR for
further characterization.

ECHO [**2149-3-27**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of
aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is mild
aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a fat pad.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2147-9-11**],
the findings are similar with mild aortic stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
66 year old female with developmental delay, bipolar disorder
who presents with altered mental status, fever, and hypotension.
Initially required pressors.  Treated with iv antibiotics for
sepsis [**1-20**] UTI and [**Location (un) **]-care associated PNA.  HCAP course
completed and then treated for UTI with oral medications.
Discharged to nursing home in stable condition on room air.

# Sepsis:  [**1-20**] UTI and HCAP.  Initially required pressors, but
quickly wenaed off. Treated with vancomycin and zosyn for 8 days
of HCAP coverage and cipro po for a total of 10 days of covereag
for complicated UTI.  Both blood and urine cx grew out
pan-sensitive E. coli. Per patient's family, has had several
episodes of sepsis [**1-20**] UTI's.  Recommend f/u with PCP to
determine if chronic abx ppx for UTI is indicated.

# Respiratory Failure:  [**1-20**] HCAP and COPD exacerbation in the
setting of underlying OSA and obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
Required intubation.  Extubated without difficulty. Treated with
abx as above.  COPD exacerbation treated with prednisone burst
that was completed prior to discharge. BNP initially was normal
at 500 but climbed to greater than [**2139**] after aggressive fluid
repletion in setting of septic shock. Following stabilization of
her blood pressure, she was diuresed with iv lasix and
eventually transitioned to on home lasix dose.  On the floor
patient was stable on room air during the day (baseline sats
88-90% on RA). Should have Bipap at night. Discharged on
nebulizer treatments. Needs close monitoring of respiratory
status at extended care facility.  Seroquel was held given
extremely high dose and concern for respiratory suppression.
Recommend f/u with PCP to determine need for pulmonology follow
up and further treatment.

# Anemia: At baseline in low 30's. Stable.  Iron studies normal.
 Consider out patient work up.

# Acute mental status changes: Likely [**1-20**] sepsis, respiratory
failure.  Resolved after abx and steroid treatment as above.

# Bipolar Disorder:  Treated with home medications of Lithium,
Haldol, Congentin  except for seroquel as above, given concern
for sedation. Haldol 1mg tid with iv prn for agitation was used
in place of seroqual.   Can coutinue to uptitrate haldol as
needed after discharge. The covering doctor for the patient's
primary outpatient psychiatrist was [**Month/Day (2) 653**] prior to
discharge.

# Fall:  Patient was found down after an unwitnessd fall at
nursing home.  Likely in setting of septic shock.  Patient had
echo revealing no a
