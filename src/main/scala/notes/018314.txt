Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Speech disturbance, Right sided weakness, Transferred from OSH
for higher level of care

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Tracheostomy and PEG
PICC line


History of Present Illness:
69yoM w/hx of HTN and hyperlipidemia who presents from OSH with
ischemic stroke (L-PCA infarction involving L-occipital and
posterior temporal lobes with conversion to hemorrhagic stroke).

Pt is from [**Country 11150**] and was brought to [**Hospital6 28728**] Center
by
his son.  [**Name (NI) **] reports that patient vomitted in his sleep and was
unable to speak.  On admission to [**Location (un) 1121**] patient was
arousable, but 'non verbal,' unable to follow commands and
'flaccid' in R-upper and lower exremities as per ED note.
.
Hosp Course at [**Hospital1 3597**].
[**9-19**] presented at OSH with aphasia, R-sided weakness
8/25 MRI showed acute ischemic change of L occipital, parietal
and temporal lobes - left thalamus diffusely involved.
Hemorrhage was noted in area of thalamus.
[**9-24**] TEE showed no obvious source of embolus, with normal EF, no
PFO.  Continued to have confusion/vomitting.  CT showed L-PCA
territory infarction with areas of hemorrhage.  Mass effect and
midline shift present.  Pt started on Aspirin 325mg, vomitting
resolved.
[**9-25**] Pt started to improve (per family) prior to increasing
somnolence on [**9-29**] (see below).  Pt had fluent speech, required 2
people to help stand, 1 to help sit, weaker on R side, mild
R-facial droop, was not oriented to date, but knew he was in
hospital.
[**9-29**] . Pt became drowsy.  CT of head showed increasing acute
intracranial hemorrhage within large L PCA territory, increasing
mass effect and midline shift compared with [**9-24**].  Neurosrug
consulted, recommended transfer to [**Hospital1 2025**].  Family decided to keep
pt at [**Hospital3 7362**] and decline neurosurgical intervention.  Pt
transferred to ICU.
[**9-30**] pt became more delirious and agitated.  Able to speak but as
per son and wife, his wording was not making any sense
[**10-1**] neuro exam remained the same, Head CT showed increased
hemorrhage and surrounding edema in L hemisphere with slight
increase in shift of midline.  Possibly interventricular
hemorrhages as well.  Pt reaffirmed decision to decline
neurosurgical intervention, but agreed to transfer pt to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Of note per OSH report BP remained 'in good control' throughout
hosp course.

No labs were done prior to discharge as pt was clinically
stable.

EEG:
[**2192-10-5**] This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of bursts
of
generalized slowing superimposed upon an asymmetry of background

activity. The first finding is suggestive of a mild to moderate
encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or anoxic etiologies. The
second
abnormality suggests a widespread area of subcortical
dysfunction
involving the left hemisphere. No evidence of ongoing or
potential
seizure activity was seen at the time of this recording.

[**2192-10-8**]  Markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the background

voltage suppression on the left side, particularly posteriorly,
and due
to the additional slowing and occasional suppression on the left
side.
These findings suggest a focal structural abnormality on the
left, but
the tracing cannot specify its etiology. In addition, the
background
was slow in all areas, suggesting a concomitant widespread
encephalopathy. Medications, metabolic disturba
