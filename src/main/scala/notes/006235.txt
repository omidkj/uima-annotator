Admission Date:  [**2126-9-4**]     Discharge Date:  [**2126-9-6**]


Service:  CARDIAC THORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 79-year-old
female referred for an outpatient cardiac catheterization
prior to aortic valve replacement and mitral valve
replacement.

The patient has been experiencing dyspnea on exertion over
the several months prior to admission and had to reduce level
of activity.

An echocardiogram done in [**2126-2-16**] showed aortic
stenosis (with 48-mm peak gradient across the aortic valve,
and 28 mean gradient across the aortic valve), severe mitral
regurgitation with thickened mitral valve leaflets, and an
ejection fraction of 70% to 75%.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (Past Medical History includes)
1.  Atrial fibrillation (on Coumadin); last dose on [**9-2**].
2.  Anemia.
3.  Gastritis.
4.  Right leg vein ligation.
5.  Right hip replacement.
6.  Right shoulder replacement.
7.  Esophageal strictures.
8.  GERD. Mild Chronic obstructive lung disease.
9.  Question of transient ischemic attack in the past.
10. Congestive heart failure, Severe mitral regurgitation,
11. Aortic stenosis. peripheral vascular disease.
 ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies

MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient underwent
catheterization on [**2126-9-4**]. Post catheterization,
she suffered hypotension to a systolic pressure of 70 mmHg,
but she remained asymptomatic. A lower abdominal CT scan
showed no abnormality. The patient had an
aortic valve replacement and mitral valve replacement on
[**2126-9-5**] using a 19-mm pericardial aortic valve and
a 25-mm pericardial mitral valve.Intraoperative TEE showed
normal LV and RV function and good prosthetic valve function.
Initially, the patient did very well, but she had a large
fluid requirement and she developed abdominal swelling. She
required pressor support to maintain her BP and her peripheral
perfusion diminished.

The patient returned to the operating room on postoperative
day zero for ventricular tachycardia arrest and acidosis.
The patient suffered a cardiac arrest but was rapidly
resuscitated. In the OR, TEE again showed normal LV and RV
function, but her abdomen continued to swell and she required
increasing fluid and pressor requirement to maintain her BP.
An intraaortic balloon pump was placed despite her PVD. After
the second operation she continued to have episodes of
hypotension, problems maintaining [**Name2 (NI) **] pressures, problems
maintaining pH, and problems maintaining [**Name (NI) 50109**].
The patient developed bleeding rectally and from her NG tube.
General surgery was consulted but she was felt not to be a
surgical candidate by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] because of her critical
condition. It was felt that she had ischemic bowel, ischemic
liver dysfunction and renal failure and that her prognosis was
poor regardless of treatment.
The patient's condition continued to deteriorate despite
aggressive treatment, and prognosis was grave.  After
discussion with the family and per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], the decision
was made to withdraw support.
The patient expired at 11:05 a.m. on [**2126-9-6**].

Once again, after discussion with the family and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
the decision to have any autopsy done was agreed upon and
will be performed.
