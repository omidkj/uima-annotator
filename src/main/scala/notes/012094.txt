Chief Complaint:
hematuria, weakness, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
83-year old Russian-speaking male with a past
medical history of IDDM, asthma, AFib on coumadin, CAD s/p CABG

in [**2105**], diabetic ulcers, chronic venous stasis dematitis/severe

lower extremity edema follwoed by vascular service presenting
with hematuria, shaking in his R arm and hypotension and
tachycarida noted in the ED. History was obtained from son and
wife, who speak English, and are patient's primary caretakers.
[**Name (NI) **] has been declining since around [**Month (only) 1096**]; used to be able to
walk around and now needs assistance to transfer from bed to
chair, and has been mostly wheelchair bound. Patient was last
admitted in [**1-30**] for cellulitis in setting of his chronic lower
extremity edema. At that time he was experiencing shakes at
home, high fevers and on admission was noted to have L lower
extremity erythema. He was treated with a course of IV abx at
home (including course of zosyn, ceftriaxone for E. coli
bacteremia). He also was referred to podiatry and conservative
measures such as wound care, leg elevation and ACE wraps have
been used by his wife in order to decrease his chance of
infection, however he still has significant lower extremity
edema bilaterally.
.
Yesterday, his wife noted that the patient was urinating more
and then had bright red urine. He had never had this before. He
had associated L sided abdominal pain. Today he had a scheduled
podiatry followup appointment for wound debridement. No
purulence or drainage was noted from ulcers. Developed shaking
chills after this appointment and presented to the ED for chills
and for hematuria as his primary complaints. No fevers,
diarrhea, chest pain. He has had a dry cough, but this is
chronic and has been getting better (per family, related to
difficulty swallowing bt this has improved). Has also been
constipatied and his wife (who is a nurse and his primary
caretaker) manually disimpacted him on Saturday.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were 97.8 131 88/45 18 95% RA. He
triggered soon after arrival for systolic BP in 80s and HR in
130s, and responded immediately to fluids. Baseline BP per the
wife who records multiple times per day is 80s-100s systolic.
Recieved vancomycin and zosyn after obtaining blood and urine cx
for concern for PNA with retrocardiac opacity noted on CXR. He
was also noted to have hematuria, foley cathter was placed and
initially urine was red with clots, but then ran clear wtihout
irrigation. Noted to have Cr elevated from baseline at 2.2,
microcytic anemia and INR 1.6 (on coumadin for Afib). Also
notedt o have transaminitis (AST 314, ALT 322), however specimen
was hemolyzed. VS on transfer afebrile, HR 87, 112/59, 22 100%
on RA. EKG with bundle branch block (old) and afib.
.

CHEST (PA & LAT) [**5-12**]:
Mild congestive heart failure with small bilateral pleural
effusions and pulmonary vascular congestion. Recommend repeat
radiograph
after diuresis to assess for resolution of retrocardiac
opacities which could represent LLL pneumonia.

Abdominal u/s [**5-12**]:
1. Main portal vein is patent.
2. Bilateral kidneys show evidence of thinning of the cortex.
3. Gallbladder wall thickening with mild gallbladder wall edema
