Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
hemodialysis
intubation


History of Present Illness:
68-year-old woman with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma diagnosed in
[**2175**]. Pt initially refused all therapies.  In [**2179-1-19**] pt
admitted with ESRD found to be Glomerular Sclerosis attributed
to her lymphoma.  During that admission pt was started on
hemodialysis along with chemotherapy (cytoxan, vinctristine and
prednisone) and discharged to [**Hospital1 **].  Pt's daughter noticed
the pt became increasingly short of breath while in the rehab
home and transferred her back to the hospital for evalution.  In
[**Name (NI) **] pt found to be confused and lethargic and was emergently
intubated for airway protection and increasing respiratory
distress. Inititial CXR showed LLL collapse, B effusions and
evidence of CHF. Repeat CXR post intubation showed re-expansion
of L lung but persistence of bilateral effusions. CTA in the
Emergency room ruled out acute pulmonary emboli. Pt started on
broad spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin, Azithromycin,
Ceftriaxone and Flagyl) and admitted to the ICU under the sepsis
protocol. ED due to temp spike to 101 and elevated lactate of
6.8 (now nl). Pt received one IVF bolus in ED. L IJ was placed
and CVP was [**10-4**]. No episodes of hypotension. Nl [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim.

[**Month/Day/Year **] [**2179-3-2**]:  EF of 20% with severe global
hypokinesis with relative sparing of the inferior and posterior
walls; +3 MR; +3 TR; dilated LA and RA;   Compared to an
[**Month/Day/Year **] in [**3-21**] pt has decreased ejection fraction from
30% and increased mitral regrugitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
68 year old female with history of lymphoblastic lymphoma
started on CVP (Cytotoxan, vincristine and prednisone) last
month.  Admitted to hospital with increasing respiratory
distress requiring intubation for airway support.  CXR
demonstrated bilateral pleural effusion with concern for
pneumonia and echo obtained on [**3-2**] confirmed a markedly
decreased ejection fraction of 20%.
.
Respiratory failure - The patient was intubated in the ED for
airway protection and increasing respiratory distress. Chest CT
angiogram ruled out acute pulmonary emboli. Initial chest x ray
showed bilateral pleural effusions and along with a retrocardiac
opacity and bibasilar collapse. Etiology of her respiratory
failure thought to be multifactoral including volume overload in
the context of her CHF and pneumonia. Cultures obtained and
patient started on broad spectrum antibiotics including
vancomycin, levofloxacin, and flagyl for her community acquired
pneumonia. Pt was also started on both albuterol and atrovent
for maximal bronchodilation. Pt's sputum cultures grew out
oropharyngeal flora and her blood cultures remained negative
throughout her admission. Pt was successfully extubated 2 days
after she admission and maintained good oxygen saturations on 2L
NC. She continued her dialysis sessions with a goal of [**2-18**].5kg
fluid removed daily.
a. Oxygen saturation >94% on room air; however, patient may
prefer to have oxygen supplementation for comfort.
b. Encourage incentive spirometry to lower risk of recurrence of
pneumonia.
c. Continue Ipratropium bromide. Hold albuterol given history of
rapid atrial fibrillation.
2. Neuro / Psych - Mental status improved to baseline with
difficulty word finding, mild anxiety, and occasional mild
confusion. Avoid benzodiazepines because they are oversedating
even at low doses.
a. Continue to avoid sedating medications
b. Frequent reorientation
c. Psych consult thought pt not competent to make major
decisions
.
ESRD - secondary to focal glomerulosclerosis likely from
involvement of lymphoma. Pt was dialyzed daily, with removal of
about 3kg fluid.
a. Discontinued phosphate binder for low phosphate as per renal
consultation.
b. Dialysis three times weekly.
c. Renally dose all medications
.
Cardiac. Pt presented with bilateral pleural effusions and was
diuresed. Found to be in atrial fibrillation and started on an
esmolol drip in the unit. [**Date Range **] obtained on [**3-2**] showed
a marked decrease ejection fraction of 20% with global LV
hypokinesis aside from the inferior and posterior walls. Echo
also revealed a severly dilated RA and RV. Compared to
[**Month/Year (2) **] in [**2178-3-19**] the Ef down from 30% and the mitral
regurg has increased.
a. Fluid removed by daily dialysis and ultrafiltration until
three times weekly schedule resumed [**2179-3-8**].
b. Gentle use of beta blockers to control rate because the
patient may need the tachycardia to offset her markedly
depressed EF of 20%. Continue to hold her calcium channel
blockers given her low ejection fraction and propensity for
extensive lower extremeity edema.
c. Cardiac diet; control fluid status via dialysis three times
weekly.
d. Not currently anticoagulated for her afib. The patient had
refused anticoag in past even after extensive discussions
involving the risk of stroke. Now, she is likely not a good
candidate for aggresive anticoagulation given the extensive
tumor burden.
e. Started on digoxin. Testing of digoxin levels is recommended
for goal of 0.7.
f. Started on lisinopril.
.
Anemia - thought to be due to anemia of chronic disease, likely
from lymphoma, chemotherapy, and ESRD. Hct stable from last
admission.
a. Continue epogen with dialysis
b. Continue multivitamin and Iron.
c. Follow hematocrit over time
6. lymphoma - Started CVP (Cytoxan, Vincristine and
Prednisone)protocol in [**2179-1-19**]. Pt's lymphadenopathy appears
dramatically improved on most recent CT scan.  She will follow
up with oncology in 1 month to determine future need for
chemotherapy.
a. Continue renally dosed allopurinol for prevention of tumor
lysis syndrome.
b. Oncology is holding further CVP (Cytoxan, Vincristine and
Prednisone) for now and will reevaluate need for further
palliative chemotherapy at follow up outpatient appointment in
one month.
