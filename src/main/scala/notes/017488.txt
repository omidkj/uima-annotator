Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2518**]
Chief Complaint:
L sided weakness, R intraparenchymal hemorrhage

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Pt. is an 84 y/o with COPD on home O2 who presents with L
sided weakness, found to have a R parietal interparenchymal
hemorrhage.

Pt. and his daughter report that he was well this morning
(although he does report that he felt generally weak and
unsteady
on his feet, and not totally himself)  [**Female First Name (un) **], who has been
helping
him out around the house, saw him in the morning and didn't
think
anything was wrong (he is very sedentary at baseline and wasn't
moving around much)  [**State 622**] saw him at lunchtime and thought
nothing was wrong.  He then noticed around [**2-22**] PM that his left
hand "felt funny."  He describes feeling "like it didn't belong
to me," and "felt like [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] log."  He thinks his left arm
and leg may have been weak, and he felt too unsteady on his feet
to walk.  He called [**Female First Name (un) **] and asked her to bring him and aspirin,
and to call 911.  He was brought to [**Hospital6 **] center.

There initial BP was SBP 200-220, and he was given 10 mg
Labetalol x 2, which brought it down to 173-185.  Head CT was
performed and showed a L sided intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  No
neurologic exam is documented in OSH records, expect on RN
transfer form they note that he is unable to move LLE and LUE
gross movement only. INR was 1.0.  He was noted to be in A fib,
with a rate in the 80s on telemetry.  He was transferred here
for
further eval.

On ROS he denies any vision changes (vision is very poor at
baseline), diplopia, nausea, vomiting, confusion, lethargy,
lightheadedness, vertigo, numbness, tingling, or bowel or
bladder
incontinence.  He has had a "sinus headache" since this morning,
which is a nagging, non-throbbing pain behind his eyes.


Past Medical History:
COPD, on home O2
Macular degeneration
Cataracts
Retinal hemorrhage
No DM, no HTN (says he gets his BP checked at the doctor and
it's
been ok)

friend who comes in and helps him with errands, chores around

myoclonus or tremor.  Strength 5/5 throughout RUE and RLE.  L
arm
flaccid, no movement, even with pinch, and showing him the arm
on
his right side.  Some triple flexion of LLE with pain, but no

NCHCT [**2190-12-30**]:
FINDINGS:  Study is limited by slight motion artifact. There is
a large acute
right frontoparietal parenchymal hemorrhage measuring 6.5 x 2.8
cm in greatest
axial dimension, with associated surrounding vasogenic edema.  A
small 2 mm in
width subdural collection layers along the posterior falx
cerebri at this
level.  No significant mass effect, shift of normally midline
structures, or
hydrocephalus is detected.  There is no definite evidence of
intraventricular
hemorrhage.  The major intracranial cisterns are preserved.  The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter differentiation is grossly preserved.

No acute fracture is detected.  The visualized paranasal sinuses
and mastoid
air cells are clear.

IMPRESSION:

Large acute right frontoparietal parenchymal hemorrhage with
surrounding
vasogenic edema and small adjacent subdural hemorrhage.  No
significant mass
effect or shift of normally midline structures is demonstrated
at this time.
There is no evidence of herniation or interventricular spread of
hemorrhage.

MRI/A/V [**2190-12-31**]:

CXR [**2190-12-30**]:
FINDINGS:  Study is limited given rotation.  Bibasilar haze most
consistent
with atelectasis. The lungs are otherwise clear.  The
cardiomediastinal
silhouette is normal in appearance.  No large effusion or
pneumothorax is
detected.

IMPRESSION:

1. Hazy bibasilar opacities are most consistent with minimal
atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Given the extent of his hemorrhage and neurologic deficits, the
patient was admitted to the neurologic ICU for further
monitoring and observation.  Given his DNI status, the patient
was started on BiPap overnight for respiratory difficulties
associated with his COPD.  His home medications and nebulizer
treatments were given as needed by respiratory therapy.  His
neurologic examination remained relatively stable the following
morning, with left-sided hemiplegia and extinction to the left
on double simultaneous stimulation.  Interestingly, he was able
to minimally wiggle the fingers on his left-side when wiggling
his right fingers.  He passed speech and swallow and was
advanced to an oral diet.

Unfortunately, his respiratory statu
