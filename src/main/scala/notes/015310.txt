Admission Date: [**2139-7-25**]        Discharge Date: [**2139-8-8**]

Date of Birth:  [**2103-2-7**]        Sex:  F

Service:  NSU


PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Left posterior communicating artery
aneurysm.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Subarachnoid hemorrhage.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a pleasant 36-
year-old woman who presented from an outside hospital with
the worst headache of her life.  She has a history of
migraines, but complained that this headache was
significantly different and significantly more painful.  Her
headache was reported as a sudden onset with sharp stabbing
pain throughout her head, initially focusing around the
periorbital area.  She also experienced some difficulties
with light complaining of photophobia.  Concurrently, she
also complained of some stiff pain from neck.  She denies any
diplopia, dysphagia, weakness, or numbness.  On [**2139-7-24**], she
went to an outside hospital where a CT was done.  Per report
the CT was negative and so an LP was performed, which showed
100 white blood cells and 12,000 red blood cells in the first
two and 100 white blood cells and 11,000 red blood cells in
the fourth.

She has subsequently been transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for further arrangement.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  She has a history of migraines, but no
other significant past medical history.

MEDICATIONS:  She does not require any medications at home.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, she was alert and
oriented x3.  She appeared very uncomfortable complaining of
a significant headache.  She was following commands in all
four extremities.  Her pupils were 4 mm to 2 mm brisk
bilaterally.  She had full extraocular movements and her face
remained symmetric.  Her tongue was midline on protrusion.
She had 5/5 strength throughout all extremities and had
normal sensation in all extremities.  Her toes were downgoing
with bilateral plantar reflexes and she did not have any
clonus.

INVESTIGATIONS:  A CT of the head performed at [**Hospital1 **] was negative for any subarachnoid hemorrhage.  CT
angiogram performed showed a PICA aneurysm that appeared
lobulated with a 4 mm neck.  Her labs on admission were
unremarkable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the Neurosurgery
Service at [**Hospital1 **].  She was taken to the
Intensive Care Unit where an A-line was placed and her blood
pressure was monitored for a goal of less than 130 systolic
blood pressure using Nipride to titrate.  She was started on
nimodipine as well as Decadron for her headache.  She
received q.1h. Neurologic checks.

Her course in the hospital was uneventful.  During her entire
stay, she remained afebrile with stable vital signs.  Her
blood pressure remained controlled on Nipride.  She was taken
the subsequent day, on [**2139-7-25**], for an angiogram.  She was
taken to the operating room for angiography, which confirmed
left posterior communicating artery aneurysm, which was
coiled in the Angio Suite. She tolerated the procedure well
with no complications.  Please see procedure note for further
details.  Postprocedure, she remained afebrile with stable
vital signs.  Followup CT scans were unchanged.

On subarachnoid day four, we started to increase her blood
pressure parameters as well as her CVP for systolic blood
pressure goals greater than 150 and CVP goals of 6 to 8.  She
received three days of aspirin, which was subsequently
discontinued.  She was placed on subcutaneous heparin and she
remained in ICU for close monitoring.  She continued to
complain of a persistent severe headache.  Ultimately, CT
scan had a slight suggestion of increased pressure and she
underwent a lumbar drain placement.  She tolerated the
procedure well with no complications.  The opening pressure
was 26 cmH2O.  The drain was left in place with the drainage
of 10 cc per hour.  She had some slight improvement with the
drain placement, but then her headaches recurred.  She
continued to do well in hospital and otherwise had an
unremarkable course.  Her headache gradually improved.  She
was seen by the Chronic Pain Service who suggested Fioricet.
The lumbar drain was removed.  On [**2139-7-31**], she also
underwent a repeat angiogram to reassess for vasospasm.
There was no evidence of vasospasm on angiogram and good
coiling of left PCA was evidenced.  She continued to do well
in hospital with an uneventful course.  She remained
neurologically intact.  Her vital signs remained stable.  She
was continued on Dilantin prophylaxis.  On subarachnoid day
10, the _______ was weaned and she was started on Midodrine.
A goal systolic blood pressure of greater than 110 was
targeted.  Subsequent days, her blood pressure was kept above
100 and above 85.  She remained asymptomatic.  No neurologic
deficits.  She was slowly weaned of her vasopressors.  She
was subsequently seen by Ophthalmology for blurred vision in
the left eye.  Neurologic exam was nondiagnostic and
ultimately they recommended to followup in the Outpatient
Clinic and possibly an angiogram to assess her filling
defects or delays of the ophthalmic artery.

Ultimately, she went to the floor and continued to do well.
She has currently been seen by Physiotherapy and cleared to
go home.  She is currently stable for discharge home.  She
has been tolerating good p.o. diet, ambulating independently,
and voiding without difficulty.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Dilantin 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Seroquel 25 mg b.i.d.
3. Neurontin 200 mg q.8 h. p.r.n.
4. Fioricet 1 to 2 tablets p.o. q.8 h. p.r.n.
5. Dilaudid 2 to 4 mg p.o. q.4 h. p.r.n.


FOLLOW UP:  She has been advised to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1132**] in two to four weeks.
