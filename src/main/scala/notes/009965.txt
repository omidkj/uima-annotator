Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p open [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] in splint, dyspnea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Achilles tendon lengthening procedure.

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 80 M with hx of Mod-severe COPD with hypoxemia,
pulm HTN, PVD, CRI now s/p achilles tendon lengthening procedure
who has been persistently hypoxic following procedure. This is
likely a continuation of his chronic state. He is being admitted
to the MICU for monitoring overnight.

The patient was followed in NY for his COPD. Per records, he has
been recommeneded to wear o2 20-24 hours daily. Pre-op today,
his o2 sat was 80% on RA. In records he has ranged from 80-92%
on RA in the past. Post op he intially desatted to the low 80s
on a nonrebreather. Throughout the day, he was weaned to nasal
cannula, but has been falling to the 70s while sleeping. This is
most likely what he does at home, but we will admit him to the
MICU to watch his sats overnight.

The patient feels well on admission the MICU team. He is satting
in the mid-high 80s on 3L NC. Patient got 80cc/hr of LR intraop.
he recieved 1mg morphine and 1 percocet post op.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**2129-6-17**]
.
Assessment:Pt is a 80 y/o M with COPD/emphysema here with
increased hypoxia postop secondary to aspiration PNA s/p
Achilles tendon surgery.
.
Plan:
.
Hypoxia: This patient has a long standing history of COPD and an
oxygen requirement at home. PFT results from [**2129-6-17**] show no
exacerbation of underlying emphysema/COPD/pulm HTN. Given
interval change of LLL opacities on CXRs from [**6-8**] to [**6-15**], and
decreased BS/egophony on physical exam, and increased oxygen
requirements, hypoxia is likely attributed to an aspiration PNA
s/p surgery, also possibly involving sedation from perioperative
opiages. It is less likely that he is in CHF given he looks
euvolemic/hypovolemic on exam, although did receive IVFs during
surgery. No PEs noted on CTA. He has no shunt on TTE/bubble
study. No levofloxacin given the new black box warnings on
tendon/ligament tears, and patient is s/p achilles tendon
lengthening procedure. Patient was covered for apsiration PNA w/
PO cefpodoxime, to be continued for a two week course until
[**2129-6-28**]. He was transitioned from a ventimask to a high flow
nebulizer, and finally to NC. He was satting 85-96% on [**3-13**] L NC.
He will need follow-up in pulmonary clinic. He was continued on
inhaled steroids and given incentive spirometry. He was
transfered to the floor.  On the floor, spiriva was added as per
pulmonary, and patient was in excellent condition, saturating at
97% on 3L NC, with 40% venti mask use at night.
.
S/p Achilles tendon repair: patient stable s/p procedure. He was
given tylenol and Ultram for post op pain. Podiatry is aware of
his transfer to the floor and will follow him.
.
CRI: Patient had elevated Cre up to 1.7, and had an episode of
oliguria requirng a straight-cath that returned 250 ccs of
fluid. Bladder scan revealed no obstruction or residual fluid.
He was given maintenance IVFS, and returned back to baseline of
1.2 by [**6-17**].
.
Peripheral [**Month/Year (2) **] Disease: Continued coumadin and plavix.
.
Ulcerative Colitis: stable , continued on asachol.
.
HTN: stable, continued on HCTZ 12.5 daily, lisinopril 10mg daiy,
and Amlodipine 5mg daily
FEN: low sodium diet (thin liquids/soft solids/supervised
feedings), lytes daily.
.
Ppx: heparin SC, coumadin, Tylenol for pain, Bowel reg
