CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: r/o PTX L

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
84 year old man with POD 2 CABG s/p L CT removal
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o PTX L
PORTABLE CHEST, [**2112-4-9**]

COMPARISON: [**2112-4-7**].

INDICATION: Chest tube removal.

Multiple lines and tubes have been removed, including a
left-sided chest tube. Questionable very small left apical
lateral pneumothorax. Heart size is normal. Left basilar
atelectasis has resolved, but there is worsening patchy
atelectasis at the right lung base.

Aorta - Ascending:  3.3 cm  <= 3.4 cm
Aorta - Descending Thoracic:  *2.7 cm  <= 2.5 cm

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Normal interatrial
septum. No ASD or PFO by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast
with maneuvers.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Mildly
dilated descending aorta. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3).
Filamentous strands on the aortic leaflets c/with Lambl's
excresences (normal variant). Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data
The post-bypass study was performed while the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by
2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with Valsalva maneuver.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Overall region wall
motion is normal with noted mild hypokinesis at the apical
segment.
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. There are filamentous strands on
the aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal
variant)
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving phenylephrine by infusion and was AV paced.
1. Regional and global left ventricular systolic function are
normal. Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
2. Aortic contours are intact post-decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
He underwent cardiac catheterization which showed three vessel
disease. Carotid u/s was normal. He was seen by neurology for
transient episodes of disorientation for several years.
He was taken to the operating room on [**4-7**] where he underwent a
CABG x 4. He was tansferred to the ICU in stable condition.
He was given 48 hours of vanocmycin perioperatively as he was in
the hospital preoperatively. He was extubated later that same
day. He was transferred to the floor on POD #1. Once on the
floor he had an uneventful post-operative course. His activity
was advanced and medications adjusted. On POD 6 he was ready for
discharge to rehab.
