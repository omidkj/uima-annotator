Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3705**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**5-23**]: bronchoscopy, intubation
[**6-1**]: bronchscopy, intubation
[**6-2**]: bronchial artery embolization
[**6-3**]: bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
62yo male with PMHx of PAF on coumadin, prostate cancer, HTN, PE
admitted with recurrent hemoptysis.
.
Patient was in his usual state of health until [**5-13**] when he had
an episode of hemoptysis.  It worsened over the course of the
day so he went to the ED.  Of note, he had a similar episode in
[**2167**] with no clear source ever found.
.
He was admitted to an OSH on [**2172-5-15**] where he was intubated
prophylactically for emergent bronchoscopy.  There was no
evidence of endobronchial lesion.  Active bleeding was from the
LLL and it was treated with diluted epi (1:[**Numeric Identifier 961**]) and iced
saline lavage of the left lung.  Patient received 10 units of
PRBCs and 5 units of FFP during hospitalization.  INR went from
2.2 to 1.1 on transfer.  His last blood transfusion was on [**5-18**].
 Lowest Hct was 22.1- on transfer it was 27.7.  Of note, patient
experienced hematuria after foley catheter placement on [**5-16**].
Urology evaluated patient and replaced the catheter.  He
remained hemodynamically stable while there.
.
He underwent a second bronch on [**2172-5-21**] where multiple clots were
suctioned from the left lower lobe.  There was also a remnant
clot in the LUL that was left at the site.  His oxygenation
improved significantly after this procedure.  He remains
intubated with FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 10.  The issue at the OSH
was that each time the patient's sedation was decreased, he
began coughing and exacerbating the hemoptysis.  Given that, he
was not given any drug holidays.  He is being transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for bronchial artery embolization.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient was intubated and sedated.
.
Review of systems: Unable to obtain as patient is intubated and
sedated.

   RESPIRATORY CULTURE (Final [**2172-6-4**]):
      SPARSE GROWTH Commensal Respiratory Flora.
      ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE.    MODERATE GROWTH.
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 62yo man with A fib on Warfarin, PE in
[**2168**], prostate cancer, and prior GI bleed who presented to OSH
with massive hemoptysis- being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
bronchial artery embolization.

 Hemoptysis-  Patient experienced massive hemoptysis at OSH
requiring 10U PRBCs and 5 units of FFP.  His last tranfusion was
on [**5-18**] and hct remained stable.  Differential diagnosis
includes bronchiectasis and occult malignancy.  IP service
consulted and performed bronchoscopy which demonstrated thick,
organized mucous blood clots in RUL, RLL, and LLL.  Rigid bronch
performed in OR, notable for friable mucosa suggestive of
DAH/vasculitis but no visible bleeding source.  Was intubated to
protect airway.  ANCA and anti-GBM were found to be negative; no
active sediment on urine an
