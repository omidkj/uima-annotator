HYPOXIA

Pacemaker implantation following PEA arrest


History of Present Illness:
72M with bipolar disorder, CAD s/p CABG and HD-dependent ESRD
from lithium toxicity and interstitial nephritis, now admitted
from outpatient transplant surgery clinic (where he had been
sent by his [**Hospital1 1501**] for planned AVF thrombectomy) with hypoxemia.
.
Pt discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2143-2-19**], had been living at a
[**Hospital1 1501**] and attending outpatient dialysis centers in the interim.
Trouble with dialysis access on [**2144-3-28**] prompted a planned
thrombectomy of clotted AV graft. While there, he was found to
be hypoxic to the 70s on RA, SOB and w/ N/V. Emesis was
non-bilious, non-bloody. No chest pain, abdominal pain or
diarrhea. No fever. Some increased LE edema. He missed dialysis
on Saturday because he was in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he was last dialyzed
Thursday [**3-26**] (4 days prior to admission).
.
In the ED, initial VS 98.0 51 116/55 22 100% 6L NC. Labs notable
for K 6.8, Cr 9.8/BUN 99, and anion gap of 20. CXR showed
RUL/RML pneumonia and LLL pleural effusion with scarring vs
pneumonia. He received 160 mg lasix IV x1 and 2g calcium
gluconate for his hyperkelemia plus vancomycin 1g and
levofloxacin 500 mg. VS upon transfer 97.8 hr 76 rr 14 b/p
122/65 96% 2 liters.
.
On arrival to the floor he was comfortable and had no
complaints. He says he feels completely well and like his usual
self, and he is quite surprised to hear he has pneumonia.
.
Renal consult team, who saw him in the ED and shortly after
arrival to the floor, decided that he needed to have a temporary
dialysis cath placed for emergent dialysis. He was quickly
transported off the floor for placement of the catheter, and
while in the dialysis was found to go into asystole. A code blue
was called. On review of his telemetry stips, he had a period of
sinus bradycardia before going into one or two brief episodes of
asystole.
.
He quickly regained a pulse following 30-60 seconds of chest
compressions. After the asystolic event he was briefly
bradycardic in the 20s with what appeared to be a ventricular
escape rhythm. He was given atropine and 1g calcium gluconate,
given his hyperkalemia on admission. His rate improved to the
80-90s. A stat chem panel showed K of 5.6, pH of 7.26, pCO2 of
41 and p02 of 213. Repeat CXR showed no major changes compared
to admission CXR (notably no PTX). He was then urgently
transferred to the MICU for further management.

IMAGING
.
[**3-30**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. Right upper lobe pneumonia.
2. Right middle lobe opacity might represent pneumonia versus
atelectasis.
3. Left-sided pleural effusion with concurrent atelectasis and
peripheral
opacity which might represent scarring although superimposed
pneumonia cannot be excluded.
.
[**4-5**] CXR
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the left
pleural effusion
and subsequent areas of atelectasis at the left lung base have
minimally decreased in severity. Also decreased in severity is
the perihilar right parenchymal opacity. Unchanged appearance of
the cardiac silhouette. Unchanged alignment of the sternal
wires.
.
[**4-11**] LUE LENI
IMPRESSION: No drainable collection identified. Peripheral
echogenic debris
seen at the region of the AV fistula, suggestive of nonoclusive
thrombus.
Additional structure which has the appearance of a graft in the
region of the arm with internal echogenic debris and lack of
vascular flow raising the possibility of thrombosis; however,
dedicated vascular ultrasound in the vascular lab is suggested
if further evaluation is desired.
.
[**2144-4-12**] CT CHEST
FINDINGS:
There are mild new tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] centrilobular opacities in the
right upper lobe (3:22), in keeping with infection.
Since the prior CT in [**2142-10-19**], there has been interval
decrease in size of the rounded atelectasis in the lingula and
