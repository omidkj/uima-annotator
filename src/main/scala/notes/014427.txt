Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Electrical cardioversion

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 75yo female who presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with 4
days of shortness of breath which became acutely worse at approx
3 am on the day of admission. At OSH the patient reportedly
gasping for air with decreased BS bilaterally and rales and was
put on BIPAP. CXR showed bilateral pulmonary edema. EKG showed
SVT with [**Street Address(2) 4793**] Elevations in 3 and AVF and depressions
laterally, L axis deviation and OSH was concerned for AMI
(inf/post). The case was discussed with an interventionalist at
[**Hospital1 **] and a decision was made to transfer pt for possible cath.

.
[**2132-10-6**] ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is dilated.
LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction ? 30
percent). The inferior and posterior walls appear akinetic; the
rest of the left ventricle appears hypokinetic. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall
contractility. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending
and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**1-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
[**2132-10-7**] CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS - IMPRESSION:
1. Cardiac enlargement with coronary artery calcifications. No
evidence for pulmonary edema. Right greater than left pleural
effusions with adjacent atelectasis, small perihepatic ascites
with fluid tracking into the pelvis, and subcutaneous
fluid/stranding probably due to third spacing.
2. 12- mm hyperdense exophytic nodule arising from lower pole of
the left
kidney is suspicious for a small renal cell carcinoma.
3. The endometrial thickness and the size of the ovaries are
more prominent than expected for the patient's age. Ultrasound
is recommended for further assessment of 2 cm thick endometrial
stripe. Differential diagnosis includes endometrial carcinoma,
hyperplasia and polyps.
4. Thyroid nodules may be further characterized by ultrasound if
not previously examined.
5. Colonic diverticulosis.
6. Likely diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver.
7. No splenomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
75yo female with no past medical history presented from [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] with shortness of breath for 4 days concerning for heart
failure and found to be in atrial flutter on transfer now s/p
electrical cardioversion in normal sinus rhythm with renal mass
on CT concerning for renal cell carcinoma and endometrium
concerning for endometrial carcinoma.
.
# RHYTHM: The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] in sinus tach and
converted to atrial flutter. She appeared to be in typical
a-flutter, with intermittent runs of a-fib. She received
Lopressor 5 IV and began loading po amiodarone for 24hrs but the
patient did not convert. Electrical cardioversion with sedation
was performed on [**10-7**]. The patient has been entirely
asymptomatic throughout this episode. She was put on a heparin
drip, Amiodarone 400mg po tid, Metoprolol 12.5mg po bid.  After
the cardioversion the patient continued to be monitored on tele
and did not re-convert to atrial flutter. She was transitioned
to coumadin and got her first dose in the hospital and was
instructed to follow up with her PCP for an INR check in 4 days.
She was given instructions for Lovenox as a bridge. Instructions
were given for an outpatient Amiodarone taper to culminate at a
dose of 200mg po qd. She was kept on Metoprolol XL 25 po qd.
.
# PUMP: The patient was found to have systolic heart failure
with an EF of 30% with a dilated LV cavity and [**1-25**]+ MR. BNP was
9991. The etiology of the cardiomyopathy is uncertain and
possibly secondary to untreated HTN, tachycardia-induced, viral
myocarditis, ischemia. ACS is unlikely given minimal enzyme
elevation and non-concerning ECG. She was started on Lisinopril
5mg po qd and Metoprolol XL 25 mg daily.
.
# CORONARIES: There is no history of CAD, however the coronaries
look calcified on CT. ECG was not convincing for ischemia. Given
the unexplained systolic HF, an inpatient stress test was
recommended but the patient refused. Her
