History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is an 84 year-old female with a history of HTN, DM,
CAD, CHF, COPD, afib, MR, CKD, Alzheimers dementia who presents
today with lethargy. Since the beginning of this year, she has
had 4 admissions.  She was most recently admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
from [**Date range (1) 3683**]/10 for shortness of breath and AMS in the setting
of a CHF exacerbation. She was diuresed with improvement and was
discharged on an increased dose of lasix 40mg [**Hospital1 **] (from daily)
and metoprolol 37.5mg [**Hospital1 **] (from 25mg [**Hospital1 **]).
.
Today, she was noted to be more lethargic at her NH with
decreased interaction and clarity of speech.  She has had a
cough for 1 week and congested sounding but nonproductive per
daughter.  She did complain of feeling cold today.  Later in the
day, she was noted to be more wheezy by her daughter and found
to to be hypoxic to the 83 on RA, tachypneic, and tachycardic,
FSBS 232.  VS T 97.9 (ax), BP 125/89, P 148, RR 20, O2sat 83%RA.
 She was transferred here.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 99.6, P 128, BP 123/85, RR 24,
O2sat 100 on NRB.  Pt awake but lethargic and poorly cooperative
with exam.  Exam notable for increased WOB and cardiac wheezes.
CXR initially concerning for CHF.  Patient given nitro 0.4mg SL,
ASA 600mg pr, and lasix 40mg IV.  However, subsequently found to
have rectal temp found to be 103, very concentrated apperaing
urine (100cc UOP after lasix), and persistently tachycardic, so
then clinical picture thought more consistent with PNA on review
of CXR.  Labs without leukocytosis; Hct, Cr at baseline.  INR
subtherapeutic at 1.5.  Bcx were drawn.  Pt was given 1L IVF,
ceftriaxone and levofloxacin in the ED with vancomycin hung en
route.  HR improved to 120-130s.  VS on transfer: P 125, BP
135/87, RR 20, O2sat 100% on bipap ([**3-26**]).
.
Patient currently on Bipap, lethargic, and not responsive to
questions.
.
ROS: Unable to obtain due to MS.

ECG [**2121-2-28**]: Atrial fibrillation. Right bundle-branch block with
left anterior fascicular block. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2121-2-24**].

Portable CXR [**2121-2-28**]: IMPRESSION: Nearly nondiagnostic study due
to respiratory motion and artifacts projecting over the right
hemithorax. Repeat radiography, if clinically feasible in the
radiology suite, are recommended for more sensitive evaluation.
Overlying pulmonary edema and pneumothorax cannot be excluded on
the basis of this exam.

ECG [**2121-3-1**]: Atrial fibrillation. Right bundle-branch block.
Left anterior fascicular block. Compared to the previous tracing
there is no change.

Portable CXR [**2121-3-1**]: IMPRESSION: 1. Decreased pulmonary edema.
2. Increased left retrocardiac density consistent with
consolidation or atelectasis.

Portable CXR [**2121-3-2**]: There is a left retrocardiac opacity with
obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm. There is also left-sided
pleural effusion which is slightly increased from previous. No
overt pulmonary edema or pneumothoraces are seen. The cardiac
silhouette is prominent but unchanged.

Portable CXR [**2121-3-2**]: IMPRESSION: Increased cardiogenic edema.
CHEST, AP: Lung apices are obscured by overlying soft tissues.
No focal
consolidation is present. Venous congestion and bilateral
layering effusions are increased. Moderate cardiomegaly
persists.
IMPRESSION: Increased cardiogenic edema.




Brief Hospital Course:
84 y/o F with hx of DM, CAD, CHF, COPD, afib, MM, HTN and CKD
who presents from NH with increased lethargy and hypoxia.

# Hypoxia:  The patient has had multiple prior admissions for
hypoxia in the setting of CHF exacerbation, although on this
admission did not appear significantly volume overloaded
clinically or by initial chest film.  She reported cough x1
week, fever of 103.4 rectally in the ED, poor clearance of
secretions and aspiration risk (although no consolidation on
film); she was therefore covered for hospital-acquired PNA with
vanco and zosyn.  Blood cultures and urine cultures were
negative and her MRSA screen was negative. The patient was
unable to provide a satisfactory sputum sample. Legionella UA
was negative. The patient was low risk by [**Doctor Last Name 3012**] Criteria for PE
so no CTA. She underwent speech and swallow evaluation given
concern for possible aspiration, but was cleared for thin
liquids and regular-consistency food (this study was done on
hospital day 3 when she was more alert than on admission). She
received IV furosemide PRN to maintain euvolemic volume status
and then returned to her home dose of lasix. She was monitored
in the MICU for 3 days, during which time OS was weaned to 3 L
by NC (from initial facemask/NRB) and she eventually was weaned
to room air. She remained afebrile after the initiation of Abx.
A picc line was placed for continued antibiotic therapy as an
outpatient. She ultimately expired on [**2121-3-9**].
