Brief Hospital Course:
50 yo female with ETOH abuse, seizures, depression who was found
by BF after falling out of bed. Presented to OSH hypoxic,
lethargic. Hypoxia improved with supplemental O2. CT head small
SAH. Neurologically intact, MAE. CKs at OSH 14,000. Pt was
admitted to SICU where a repeat CT of the head showed no change
in SAH size, no mass effect and the patient's mental status
cleared. She was transferred to the floor and evaluated by PT
and OT who found her safe for discharge home providing she had
close supervision from family members. Initially, family was not
eager to have patient return home without pt having acute [**Hospital **]
rehab (which was offered to patient but she refused), but
ultimately patient's boyfriend agreed to provide supervision.
