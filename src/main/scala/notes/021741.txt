HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old female
with witnessed fall out of wheelchair, hitting head on a
cabinet.  She currently lived in a nursing home at the time
of injury.  She was brought to [**Hospital3 **] where a CT
showed a left frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage with contusion.
Daughter was with the patient at the time of the fall and
reports that she has had declining mental status.  At
baseline she has right-sided weakness with some speech
difficulty from an old cerebrovascular accident which was
many years prior to admission, however, now worse.  She also
was on Coumadin for her cerebrovascular accident.  Patient
speaks Portuguese only.  The daughter assisted with
translation.

On arrival to the Emergency Room her vital signs blood
pressure was 190 systolic, heart rate in the 90s, 16.
Patient had a collar in place for C-spine precautions.  She
also had a sutured wound over her right eye and a stapled
wound in her front scalp.  Her eyes opened to voice.  She
followed some commands.  Pupils were 3 to 2 bilaterally,
sluggish, reactive.  EOMs appeared full.  Motor strength in
her left upper extremity was antigravity.  Left lower
extremity was antigravity.  Right upper extremity had no
movement, and right lower extremity she did attempt to lift.
Her deep tendon reflexes were 1 throughout.

ADMITTING MEDICATIONS:
1. Protonix 40.
2. Senna b.i.d.
3. Lasix 80 once daily.
4. MVI.
5. Lactulose 30 cc.
6. Celexa 20.
7. Nitrodisc 0.3 mg an hour.
8. Duragesic.
9. Coumadin 5 mg.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for ascites, coronary
artery disease, hypertension, old cerebrovascular accident.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  PT was 23, PTT 44, INR 3.3.
White count 8.3, hematocrit 27.4, platelets 153.  Sodium 143,
3.7, 101 for chloride, 30 for bicarbonate, BUN was 35/1.7,
and 159 for her glucose.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 37063**] was a Jehovah's Witness and that
made us unable to give her any blood products, such as fresh
frozen plasma.  Her increased INR was treated with vitamin K
only.  Again, Mrs. [**Known lastname 37063**] was a Jehovah's Witness and we were
unable to give her any blood products.  Her INR was covered
only with vitamin K injections.

She had a repeat stat head CT.  She was given vitamin K to
decrease her INR.  Neuro Medicine saw the patient also and
strict blood pressure parameters.  Trauma Surgery also saw
the patient due to her fall, which they cleared her C, L, and
T spines without difficulty and did not have any further
recommendations.  She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit
where her blood pressure was controlled with
antihypertensives and her INR was repressed.

On her second hospital day her INR still remained high at
2.5.  Her hematocrit was stable at 27.4.  She continued to
have her blood pressure controlled less than 140.  Her head
CT on her second hospital day was stable.  She was given
nicardipine for blood pressure control.  She had a left
subclavian placed.  Was noted to have abdominal distention.
She also had questionable pain to her abdomen, and abdominal
CT revealed ascites, which they felt was old, but no acute
pathology was going on.  Neurologically, she moved her left
side well, and she followed commands.

On hospital day number 3 there were discussions with the
family, who made sure again that she was a DNR/DNI.  Also,
she had some episodes of atrial flutter for which she was
given 15 mg of Lopressor which decreased her rate.  Patient
was also a Jehovah's Witness, so no blood products were
allowed to be given.  Cardiology was consulted for slow
atrial fibrillation for which they recommended an
echocardiogram and monitoring the patient closely, using
atropine as needed for low heart rate.  Vitamin K continued
to be kept in hopes of decreasing her INR.

On [**9-29**] family requested that her collar be removed.
However, because patient was not a reliable source to tell us
if she had neck pain, we were hesitant to remove her C-spine
cervical collar.  However, the family insisted and was given
the risks of possibly removing it, such as paralysis of her
spinal cord injury.  However, they insisted to have the C-
collar removed.

On [**9-30**] she was found to be awake, following some commands.
Hematocrit dropped to 23 down from 27.  The family again did
not want transfusions based on being a Jehovah's Witness.
INR had come down to 1.5 using only vitamin K.  Her sodium
had been noted to be at 149.  She was taking some p.o. fluids
on her own.  She was transferred to the Surgical floor,
noting that she was a DNR/DNI, and the family did not want
aggressive treatment.  On [**10-1**] she was awake, alert, had
some internal rotation of her upper extremity, was moving her
left side spontaneously, and followed some commands.
Physical Therapy was consulted to work with her.

On the morning of [**10-3**] the patient was noted to be
tachypneic overnight and was given Lasix 120 mg.  Over a
total of 3 hours she put out 575 cc of urine.  Her lungs had
bilateral crackles, left greater than right.  Her heart rate
was irregular in the 90s and was noted to have a systolic
murmur.  Abdomen was distended.  Bowel sounds were faint.
She opened her eyes spontaneously.  She was afebrile.  Blood
pressures were 140s/70s, heart rate 80 to 100, respirations
were 22 to 30, and her O2 sat was 96 to 98 percent on 50
percent face mask.  ABG was sent and showed 7.30 for pH, 35
for CO2, 108 for PO2.  A chest x-ray was also placed, and the
family was called.

Spoke with her daughter, [**Name (NI) 1787**], who was the healthcare
proxy.  It was reiterated that Mrs. [**Known lastname 37063**] did not want to
have any life prolonging procedures, such as intubation, no
tubes, and no further tests such as a CAT scan.  They just
wanted to make her as comfortable as possible.  So, at that
point we decided to make her comfort measures only.  She was
started on some intravenous fluids since she was not
drinking.  She was given Lasix to help diurese her and help
decrease her congestive heart failure.  On [**10-4**] at 1:20 in
the morning Mrs. [**Known lastname 37063**] passed away.  She was given periodic
morphine as needed.
