Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2763**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation and mechanical ventilation
placecement of right IJ central venous line
placement of left radial arterial line
paracentesis

History of Present Illness:
 History related by patient's girlfriend, [**Name (NI) 4051**] [**Name (NI) **],
although the patient was able to speak in ED and corroborate the
history.
Mr. [**Known lastname 52368**] is 60 year old male, with HCV cirrhosis, h/o varices,
and gastric ulcers, presents with 1 week of worsening dyspnea.
The pt's girlfriend reports that two weeks ago the pt developed
a "respiratory illness" and was seen in PCP's office and given
an antibiotic. The pt never fully improved, and over the past
week had worsening dyspnea. On the day prior to admission he
developed severe abdominal pain, and then described pain as
being "all over," in back, chest and abdomen. He began retching
and had some hemoptysis or hematemesis (unclear which), and was
noted to have blood in stools.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 100.9 80 98/50 24 100%RA. Pt was
speaking in [**3-11**] word sentences and described severe pain
diffusely. On exam the pt had abdominal guarding and was moaning
in pain. Lungs were clear and asterixis was present. EKG was
unremarkable. The pt was sent for CT chest and abdomen, and in
CT scan BP dropped to 60/30, and the pt was started on dopamine.
His BP did not respond to maximum dopamine and the pt was
switched to neosyn with good response in BP. He was intubated, a
R IJ central line was placed and neo was weaned as pressures
were up to SBP 140. Blood cultures and ascitic fluid cultures
from dx paracentesis were sent and the pt was given one-time
doses of Vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Following
intubation, the pt was unresponsive so Head CT was obtained
prior to transfer to MICU. Prelim read of head CT was negative.
.
On arrival to MICU, pt wa hypothermic. An arterial line was
placed and pt was noted to have blood in NGT. Hepatology was
contact[**Name (NI) **].


Past Medical History:
1. Hepatitis C cirrhosis w/ portal hypertension, esophageal
varices (grade 2 [**2150-6-19**]), and thrombocytopenia. Non responder
to interferon monotherapy and to interferon with ribavirin.
2. Hypertension
3. Upper GI bleed due to gastritis.
4. Healed antral ulcer on EGD [**2150-6-19**]
5. Chronic epistaxis


Social History:
He live alone in [**Location (un) **], no longer drives. Has not drunk
alcohol since [**Month (only) 116**]. Has a distant history of iv drug use over
20years ago. He smokes occasionally, [**1-9**] cigarettes a month, but
has a 20 year history of smoking [**1-9**] ppd.


Family History:
Brother with Hep C cirrhosis s/p liver transplant

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute aortic abnormality, or central or segmental
pulmonary embolus.
2. Cirrhotic liver with moderate ascites and paraesophageal
varices. Patent portal vein.
3. Distended gallbladder without other evidence of acute
cholecystitis.
4. Moderate emphysematous changes in the lungs.
5. Hypodense liver lesion, not fully characterized. When
clinical condition stabilizes, this can be further assessed via
multiphasic liver CT or MRI.

CXR:  [**2150-12-13**]
SINGLE PORTABLE UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: Lung volumes are low,
and linear opacities are present at both lung bases, consistent
with atelectasis. The upper lung zones are well aerated. The
heart is normal in size. There is no hilar or mediastinal
enlargement. Pulmonary vascularity is normal. There is no
evidence of free intraperitoneal air. There is no pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Low lung volumes with bibasilar atelectasis.
.
CT head: [**2150-12-13**] No ICH, midline shift or masses.
.
Abd US [**2150-12-16**]: 1. Cirrhosis. Patent portal vein with
hepatopetal flow.
2. Moderate ascites. Marked place for paracentesis in the left
lower
quadrant. 3. Distended gallbladder without evidence of stones.
.
CT abd/pelvis [**2150-12-17**]: 1. Liver cirrhosis with portal
hypertension evidenced by ascites and many, including
esophageal, varices.
2. Indeterminate liver lesion is seen, which is new since the
previous MRI
dated [**2150-5-18**], however, is unchanged since previous CT
dated [**2150-12-13**]. This should be further evaluated with
MRI when the patient is more stable.
3. High density material lying dependently in the fluid in the
pelvis, which likely is due to a small amount of blood, probably
from reccent paracentesis.
  4. Multiple poorly defined peripheral low density areas in the
spleen, which is likely due to altered perfusion of the spleen;
a finding that has been present since [**2150-5-8**].
5. Moderate chronic stenosis of the celiac artery at its origin,
with the
enlargement of mild collaterals from the SMA. No evidence of
mesenteric
ischaemia.
.
EGD [**6-/2150**]:
Esophagus: Protruding Lesions 4 cords of grade II varices were
seen in the gastroesophageal junction and lower third of the
esophagus. No stigmata of high bleeding risk.
Stomach:  Other Helaed antral ulcer.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
.
ECHO [**4-/2150**]:
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. Left ventricular systolic function
is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic LV systolic function. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

.
EKG: NSR 75, isolated TWF in III, no ST changes, no peaked T
waves, no PR depressions


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 52368**] is a 60 year old man with history of hepatitis C (s/p
interferon rx with no response), cirrhosis, esophageal varices
and hyponatremia admitted with dyspnea and diffuse abdominal
pain, presenting with peritonitis and dyspnea.
.
#. Sepsis: The patient presented to the MICU in septic shock,
with hypotension, altered mental status and respiratory failure.
His sepsis was thought to be due to his peritonitis, as
described below. He was initially treated with broad-spectrum
antibiotics (vancomycin, zosyn, clindamycin and micafungin),
pressors and IVF boluses. He was transfused as needed for anemia
and dropping hematocrits. At presentation to the MICU, the
patient was also hypothermic (tem
