EGD [**2128-8-4**]:
-Normal mucosa in the esophagus
-Prior gastric bypass surgery noted, with small erosions in the
pouch but --no ulcerations noted
-Normal mucosa in the roux-n-y limb


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:
64M with hx of hypertension, gastric bypass, presented with
melena and lightheadedness.
.
# GI Bleed
Likely upper GI bleed, potentially secondary to NSAID use.
Patient reported lightheadedness for a few days, concerning for
brisk GI bleed, though he has not had any further melena since
yesterday and reports no BRBPR.  He received 2u pRBCs since
presentation with an appropriate rise in his HCT and denies
lightheadedness or orthostatic symptoms currently.  INR was
initially 2.2 at presentation patient was treated with 10 mg
Vitamin K as well as one unit FFP with an improvement in INR.
An EGD was preformed by GI which showed normal mucosa through
out the esophogus and roux-en-Y with mild erosions, but no
ulcerations in the remnant pouch.  Patient was seen by Surgery
who felt the likely etiology to be related to elevated INR and
NSAIDS.  He was placed on a PPI drip, misoprostil and clear
liquid diet.   HCT was stable with no signs of bleeding prior to
transfer from the MICU. Hematocrit remained stable with no
further bleeding on the medical floor. He was discharged with
plans for outpt f/u. He was continued on misoprostol and
pantoprazole at the time of discharge.
.
# Aflutter s/p ablation on warfarin: Anticoagulation was
reversed as above. Coumadin was held at discharge, should be
restarted as an outpatient.
.
# Hypertension: Initially held antihypertensives [**2-11**] GIB.
However, they were restarted when there were no further episodes
of bleeding.
.
# Back Pain: Encouraged patient to avoid NSAIDS. Continued home
vicodin.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Coumadin and aspirin were held at discharge. Should be
restarted as an outpatient.
