BMT. She is scheduled to begin chemotherapy on [**7-16**]. AML
diagnosed  in [**11-2**] after a flu-like syndrome with fever, aches,
and a WBC 170K. Bone marow and blood c/w AML. Cytogenetics
normal. Received 7+3 (idarubicin/cytaribine). Day 14 bone marrow
showed aplasia and pt had slow increase in WBC. D30-35, marrow
showed no leukemia. Bx showed small # blast forms. Day 42, WBC
back up and a raised purplish skin lesions appeared, dignosed as
leukemia cutis. In [**Month (only) 956**] had Reinduction with 7+3 again,
resulting in aplastic marrow with complete remission, but again
she had recurrence of purplish skin lesions (again leukemia
cutis). Patient had HiDAC consolidation with no recurrence. Also
had MEC therapy [**5-15**], resulting in fatigue, nausea, and
vomiting. Lesions resolved, and the patient was scheduled for a

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had a very long and complicated hospital course
post-BMT.  She was initially transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in [**Month (only) 216**]
after developing altered mental status and hypoxia on the floor.
 While in the ICU, she was intubated and extubated 4 different
times.  An etiology of her respiratory failure was never
established, although she was treated for diffuse alveolar
hemorrhage, pneumonia, and CHF.  She would initially recover
with mechanical ventilatory support and then worsen 2-7 days
post-extubation, requiring reintubation.  Her course was
complicated by what was felt to be chemo-related CHF with an EF
of 20%, which improved on a subsequent echo.  From an ID
standpoint, she never grew anything from any of her studies
except for a mold from one of her bronchs (species Curvularia)
which was felt to be a contaminant.  She also developed renal
failure [**2-1**] cyclosporine which resolved.  She was felt to have
TTP as well.  Approximately 1.5 weeks prior to her death, she
was extubated and did well initially.  Her mental status
improved greatly once she was off all sedation, and she was able
to interact meaningfully with her family.  She was transferred
upstairs to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1826**] and began to do poorly, becoming
increasingly hypoxic.  She was transferred back to the ICU and
was intubated.  She became hypotensive requiring 3 pressors.
She then developed status epilepticus, unresponsive to ativan,
dilantin, and phenobarbitol.  She was evaluated by neurology at
that time, who felt she had likely suffered an intracranial
hemorrhage.  The attending oncologist Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] spoke with
the family, who agreed to extubate her and allow her to die
peacefully, which she did on [**2196-9-24**] with her family at her
side.
