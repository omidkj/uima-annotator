160 cc in the OR and 32 cc in the PACU (5 hours).

ROS: The patient admits to diarrhea recently and nausea this am.

constipation, melena, hematochezia, chest pain, shortness of
breath, lower extremity edema, cough, urinary frequency,
urgency, dysuria, lightheadedness.

2.  Small cell lung cancer status post lung resection.
3.  Perforated diverticulum [**4-21**] s/p sigmoid Hartmann's.
4.  Sleep apnea, does no wear CPAP
5.  Diastolic heart failure secondary to hypertension with
preserved ejection fraction.
6.  Hypothyroidism.
7.  Pacemaker for tachy-brady syndrome status post AV junctional
ablation.
8.  Chronic renal insufficiency (baseline Cr of 0.8-1, but more
recently elevated to 1.8)
9.  COPD
10. History of embolus to the Left arm
11. Hypertension

PSH:
s/p hysterectomy
Left lower lobe resection for lung nodule. [**1-22**]
Laparoscopic R colectomy [**10-21**] for adenoma c high grade
dysplasia

ECG: Atrial pacing at 60 bpm, nl axis, TWI in I, II, V2-V6.
Widened QRS.  No STE or STD.

Imaging:
CXR ([**2147-1-5**]):  No acute cardiopulmonary process.


Brief Hospital Course:
Neuro: She was managed with pain control in the immediate
postoperative period.  On POD #5, she was noted to be somnolent
with left-sided neglect.  She was able to follow commands but
not moving her left side.  An emergent CT head was obtained that
demonstrated a significant right sided MCA stroke.  An immediate
Neurology/Stroke consult was obtained, and their service
followed the patient closely. She was given a poor prognosis
given the size of the stroke.  In the immediate period, cerebral
edema was minimized by limiting her IVF and allowing her to
become hypernatremic.  Anticoagulation was not started given the
risk of conversion to hemorrhagic stroke.

CV: She had a history of atrial fibrillation, and was managed
with Lopressor IV.  In the initial period of her ATN,
Electrophysiology was asked to interrogate her pacemaker and
increase her rate from 60.  It was felt that increasing her HR
may improve cardiac output and increase perfusion to her
kidneys.

Resp: Given the large volumes of fluid that she received in the
immediate postoperative period, her respiratory status was
closely monitored.  She did require periods of bipap, but never
progressed to intubation.  As she began to diurese, her
respiratory status improved and had good O2 saturations by POD
#5.

GU: In the PACU, she was anuric, and considered to be in a
pre-renal state.  She was aggressively resuscitated.   Despite
multiple fluid boluses, she remained oliguric, and was
transferred to the ICU for central line placement to transduce a
CVP to obtain objective measures of her fluid status.  A bedside
echo was obtained that demonstrated respiratory variation in her
aortic flow, suggestive of a hypovolemic state.  A renal
consultation was also obtained, and again felt to be in
pre-renal ATN.  She was initially unresponsive to Lasix,
however, by POD #4, began to diurese and over the next few days
had an improving creatinine level.

After conversations with the ICU team, the primary team, and the
Neurology/Stroke service, given the patient's poor prognosis,
she was made CMO, and expired on [**2147-1-18**].
