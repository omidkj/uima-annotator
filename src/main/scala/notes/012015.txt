2 weeks of worsening abdominal pain, shortness of breath and

sat 93% -> 97% RA after getting nebs.  Pt requested eval at
[**Hospital1 18**] ED.  On arrival to ED AF, 100, 130/60 92% RA.  Pt became
more tachycardic with HR 140s and hypoxic for which she was
placed on NRD (93%).  She was given lasix, starting on a nitro
gtt and placed on BiPap.  Pt then started on Hep gtt for
suspicion of PE.  Pt remained tachycardic 140's when 3 hours
later recieved 10mg Dilt prior to transfer to MICU.

Pertinent Results:
RUQ U/S: Extensive pneumobilia. Mild intrahepatic ductal dil.
CBD not dilated at about 5-6mm with wallstent. Gallbladder
sludge with mild GB wall thickening and small amount of
pericholecystic fluid. Pancreatic duct prominent but not
dilated.

ABD CT:
1. Findings consistent with acute cholecystitis likely from
occlusion of the cystic duct by tumor infiltration.
2. Wallstent remains within the distal common duct.
3. Possible tumor involvement of the right hepatic duct
4. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with atelectasis of a
significant portion of the left lower lobe.
5. Left adrenal adenoma.
6. Right renal cyst.

Lower Ext u/s: No evidence of DVT in either lower extremity.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 89 F with COPD/CAD/CHF/CAD/AF and recently diagnosed
panc-ca who presents with hypoxic respiratory failure
.
# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  This was thought secondary to
diastolic dysfunction and tachycardia causing poor LV filling
and subsequent pulmonary edema.  PE thought unlikely and heparin
gtt started in ED stopped on arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Had brief period
of BiPAP but during [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] stay, family elected to not pursue
aggressive ventilatory support.  Was treated initially with
diltiazem for rate control and furosemide for diuresis with some
success. Pt. then had worsening of her abdominal pain and an
abdominal CT done showed stricture at the cystic duct.
Evaluated by ERCP but family did not want to pursue aggressive
measures such as cholecystostomy drain.  Started briefly on
meropenem/flagyl for possible cholangitis.  With further
worsening of hypoxia, family elected to pursue comfort measures.
 Placed on morphine gtt and pt. had progressive worsening of
dyspnea treated with morphine titrated to comfort.  Patient
underwent cardiopulmonary arrest and expired with her family at
the bedside.
