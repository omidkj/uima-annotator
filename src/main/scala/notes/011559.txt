History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 74228**] is 67 yo male with PMH significant for NASH
cirrhosis complicated by portal hypertensive gastropathy and was
recently admitted for an upper and lower GI bleeding for which
he required admission ([**Date range (1) **]) and urgent TIPS placement on
[**6-18**]. After the TIPS he had no further episodes of bleeding. He
did develop mild pulmonary edema which responded to diuresis. He
did develop a progressive hyperbilirubinemia which was found to
be largely indirect and was thought to be likely hemolysis in
the setting of receiving blood transfusions. His TIPS was
evaluated prior to discharge with an ultrasound which showed
that the TIPs was patent and then he was discharged home.
He then presented to the ED the following day ([**6-26**]) with new
onset nausea and vomiting. His bilirubin was also noted to
elevated to 33.2 from 22.6 at the time of her last discharge.
There was concern for a biliary leak given her recent TIPs
procedure and the plan was for TIPs reduction. Per the
radiologist, the attempt to reduce the shunt with a stent was
not successful so it was pulled out. There was approximately
200-400cc of blood loss during this time. He was then
transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring.

Studies:
.
[**2110-6-26**] Ultrasound: Patent TIPS, with appropriate direction of
flow. Velocities within the main portal vein and TIPS are mildly
increased in comparison to the baseline exam from [**2110-6-22**]
suggesting interval growth of intimal hyperplasia.
.
[**2110-6-30**] TIPS redo: Placement of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 74229**] covered stent into the
existing Wallstent. Decrease in portosystemic gradient from 11
mmHg to 8 mmHg.
.
[**2110-7-1**] MRI: No focal liver lesions identified. Findings
consistent with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Right greater
than left pleural effusions. Infrarenal abdominal aortic
aneurysm measuring 3.5 cm.
.
[**2110-7-3**] HIDA Scan: Insufficient study to exclude/diagnose biliary
leak in the setting of vicarious excretion related to hepatic
failure.


Brief Hospital Course:
1)NASH cirrhosis: Patient presented with acute decline in
hepatic function as evidenced by rising direct bilirubinemia
along with worsening INR. Likely due to TIPs shunt diversion
away from liver resulting in relative hypoperfusion and
depressed function. His lasix and aldactone were initially held
given hypotension; but they were restarted at time of transfer
to the liver service. He was continued on lactulose and
rifaximin for his hepatic encephalopathy.  TIPS revision was
unsuccessful.  Liver failure progressed. Pt underwent evaluation
for liver transplant.  Cardiac evaluation revealed pt has
multiple cardiac issues that would make him inelibible for
transplant. Pt and family were notified that he would not be
eligible for transplant.  With progression of liver failure
palliative care and hospice were consulted.  Pt was scheduled to
return home with hospice services.  However, pt expired the
evening prior to his scheduled discharge.
.
2)Hypotension: Patient presented with nausea and vomiting and
was noted to have  a significant rise in his bilirubin. On
previous admission he underwent TIPs on [**6-18**] and was then
discharged on [**6-25**]. Ultrasound prior to discharge showed patency
of the TIPs. On this admission, given his rising bilirubin, he
was taken to IR and stent placement was attempted through the
RIJ without success. EBL was approximately 200-400cc. He was
then transferred to the MICU for closer monitoring. Upon
transfer to the MICU he was significantly hypotensive 2/2 blood
loss in the setting of his coagulopathy. An emergent LIJ central
line was placed and he received 5 units pRBCs, 2 units FFPs, and
1 unit of platelets. During his stay in the MICU, despite a rise
in his bilirubin, his hematocrit remained stable. He was taken
back to IR once he was hemodynamically stable which showed that
his TIPs was patent and a biliary stent was placed in hopes to
prevent further rising of his bilirubin.  Pt was then transfered
to the liver service with blood pressure stable at baseline.
.
3)CHF: Recent ECHO on [**6-25**] showed mild systolic dysfunction with
EF 45-50%. He is on Lasix and Aldactone as an outpatient. He
received additional doses of IV lasix in the setting of
receiving multiple blood products. At time of transfer to the
liver service, he was restarted on home diuretic regimen.
.
4)Pleural effusion: Patient noted to have R sided pleural
effusion on chest x-ray. Likely [**12-28**] underlying liver disease and
systolic dysfunction.
.
5)Type 2 DM: Patient is on Glyburide as an outpatient but this
regimen was held during his inpatient stay. He was placed on an
insulin sliding scale with close monitoring of his blood sugars.
.
6)Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine was initially held but then
restarted once he was medically stable.
