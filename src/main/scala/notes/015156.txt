Pertinent Results:
[**2117-10-7**] ECHO
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus
is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 84824**] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. A-pacing for slow sinus
rhythm. Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position.
No AI, trivial paravalvular leak that wqas not seen after
protamine administration. Normal biventricular systolic
function. Trace MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] aortic contour is normal post
decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**10-4**] and completed pre-operative work-up with cardiac
cath. Underwent Coronary artery bypass grafting x 3 (Lima->Left
anterior Descending/Saphenous vein grafted to Posterior
descending artery/Obtuse Marginal)/Aortic Valve Replacement
(#21mm Pericardial tissue valve) with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**10-7**].Cross
clamp time= 108 minutes, Cardiopulmonary bypass time= 124
minutes. Immediate postoperative reexploration for chest tube
bleeding/tamponade and evacuated clot. Please refer to
Dr[**Doctor Last Name 14333**] operative report for further details.
Mr.[**Known lastname **] was intubated and sedated in critical but stable
condition when transferred to the CVICU. A burst of Nonsustained
Ventricular tachycardia occurred postop night. EP was consulted
for postop arrythmia. He was weaned off pressors, awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated on POD #1. All lines and
drains were discontinued in a timely fashion.
Beta-blocker/aspirin/statin/ diuresis were initiated. He
continued to progress and was transferred to the floor on POD #2
to begin increasing his activity level. Physical therapy
evaluated and consulted. The remainder of his postoperative
course was essentially uneventful. He was cleared for discharge
by Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] on POD# 5. As per Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **], upon
discharge, Mr.[**Known lastname **] will not resume Plavix. All follow up
appointments were advised.
