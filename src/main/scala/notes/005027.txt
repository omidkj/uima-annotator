Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 618**]
Chief Complaint:
Right hemiplegia and aphasia.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
-Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation
-Bronchoscopy
-Tracheostomy
-PEG placement

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 75 year old right handed man with a history of diet
controlled
cholesterol, previous stroke, who presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital
with right hemiplegia and aphasia.

His wife reports that patient was well at 10pm when he went to
take a shower. She then went to get ready for bed, and found
patient lying in shower. Patient was not moving right side, was
using left arm to try and get up. He did seem to recognize wife,
but did not seem to understand speech or commands when spoken
to.

EMS transported patient to [**Hospital **] Hospital within 3 hours.
While there, he had episode of vomiting, and was intubated due
to concerns for aspiration. CT scan there showed no hemorrhage.
Wife and daughter report that patient was following commands
after intubation. ED physician at [**Name9 (PRE) **] Hospital gave NIHSS 22
while neurologist scored his NIHSS as 29. Policy at [**Hospital **]
Hospital is no IV tPA for NIHSS>20. Therefore, patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration for IA tPA.

Patient arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] at 4hrs, 20min. He was initially
hypertensive to 185 systolic, but subsequently SBP fell to 100s
and patient was started briefly on neosynephrine. On arrival,
NIHSS 21. Emergent CTA was performed, which confirmed no
hemorrhage and showed patent large vessels. Since there was no
evidence for clot, IA tPA was not given. Instead, pt was
enrolled in DEFUSE trial with consent of wife and daughter. MRI
was performed. Paitent then given IV tPA approixmately 5 hours
and 55 minutes after onset.

On review of systems, has had no recent fevers, chills,
illnesses, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or
headaches per his wife.

family, no residual deficit. Workup at [**Hospital 1774**] Hospital with small
vessel disease per family. Was on coumadin for 6 weeks, and has
[**Doctor First Name **] on Aggrenox since. Sees Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 58659**] in Neurology at
[**Hospital1 1774**].
2. Hypercholesterolemia: currently diet-controlled
3. S/p appendectomy
4. Hard of hearing bilaterally


Social History:

EKG [**2196-1-14**]: Sinus rhythm with frquent atrial ectopy. P-R
interval 0.16. No previous tracing available for comparison.
-----
Transthoracic Echo [**2196-1-14**]: The left atrium is normal in size.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D,
color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic root
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
-----
Transesophageal Echo [**2196-1-29**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated.
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function. There are
simple atheroma in the ascending aorta, the aortic arch and the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets(3) are
minimally thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-22**]+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are m
