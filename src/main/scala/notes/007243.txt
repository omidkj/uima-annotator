HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was initially evaluated in the
emergency room and begun on IV heparin with bolus. Coag's
were monitored and heparin dosing was adjusted. The patient
was consulted to the vascular service and admitted under the
care of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. IV heparinization was continued. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 27199**] for Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. She felt that the
stump was not acutely threatened and the heparinization was
continued and continue to monitor serial peripheral vascular
exams. Would plan a duplex of the ax-fem, fem-fem bypass and
plan for an arteriogram. The patient had an arterial duplex
study done on [**2106-8-21**] which occlusion of the left
axillary femoral bypass distal to the confluence of the fem-
fem and ax-fem graft. The iliofemoral graft was not
identified. Findings were reviewed with the physician taking
care of the patient. On [**2106-8-24**], the patient was taken
to the angio suite to undergo a diagnostic arteriogram. This
was aborted because the patient had an anaphylactic reaction

intubation. The patient then was transferred to the surgical

patient did have enzymes done which were negative for acute
myocardial infarction. She remained in the SICU overnight and
was extubated and transferred to the VICU for continued care.
