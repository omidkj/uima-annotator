Service:  CICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:    Transferred from Orthopedics for
management of community-acquired pneumonia.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 80 year old
female with a history of hypertension, dementia, Alzheimer's
type, and ulcerative colitis, who was admitted via the
Emergency Department [**2177-9-17**], after a witnessed fall at
the nursing home and was found to have a broken left hip for
which she underwent open reduction and internal fixation by
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**2177-9-19**].

While being evaluated in the Emergency Department, the
patient was found to be hemodynamically stable, afebrile,
with urinalysis consistent with urinary tract infection and
she was started on Ciprofloxacin.  The patient is not able to
recall any details of her fall due to her dementia.  Per the
nursing staff at the nursing home, there was no loss of
consciousness.

While in the Emergency Department, she was noticed to have
saturations of 85% on room air and 93 to 95% on four liters.
A chest x-ray was obtained which suggested right middle lobe
infiltrate and Ciprofloxacin was changed to Levofloxacin.

Following the Orthopedic surgery, the patient was not
extubated and was transferred to the CICU for extubation and
further management.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.3 F.; blood pressure
110/80; respiratory rate 16; O2 saturation 98%; heart rate
95.  Generally, the patient is sedated.  HEENT:  The pupils
were pinpoint, symmetric.  Oropharynx was moist.  There was
poor dentition.  Neck was supple, no lymphadenopathy or
jugular venous distention.  Pulmonary with good breath sounds
bilaterally; few rales bilateral bases and bronchial breath
sounds in the right mid lung zones.  Heart was regular rate
and rhythm, normal S1, S2; no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended without masses.
Slightly hyperactive bowel sounds.  Extremities without
cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  There were Doppler-able distal
pulses.

LABORATORY:  Laboratory findings on transfer showed a sodium
of 130, potassium 3.6, chloride 100, bicarbonate 16; BUN 8,
creatinine 0.6, glucose 114.  Her white blood cell count was
13.1 with 90 neutrophils, zero bands, 6 lymphocytes, 3
monocytes, 0.3 eosinophils, and 0.2 basophils.  Her
hematocrit was 30 and platelet count was 197.  Calcium 8.1,
magnesium 1.9, phosphate 2.9.  Her lactate was 1.6.

PT and INR were 14.6 and 1.5 respectively.  PTT 36.1.  Serum
osmolality was 259.  Urine osmolality was 338.  Creatinine
was 16 and sodium was 18 in her urine.

Her sputum culture was pending and her urine culture was
showing Gram negative rods, more than 100,000.  Sensitivities
were pending.

Her chest x-ray showed right mid-lung opacity suggestive of
pneumonia.  NG tube was above the GE junction and was
advanced.

Hip films post-orthoplasty showed anatomic alignment.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, the patient is an 80 year old
female with a history of hypertension, dementia, and
ulcerative colitis, status post fall and left hip fracture
requiring orthoplasty.  Currently with Gram negative rod
urinary tract infection and right middle lobe pneumonia.  She
was intubated for surgery and still vented.  She was
transferred to SICU for weaning.

1.  Cardiac:  During this hospitalization, the patient
developed an episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response to 150 beats per minute.  During this
episode, she developed hypotension.  She was not responsive
to Atenolol and with Diltiazem, slowed down her ventricular
response and broke back into a normal sinus rhythm.  This was
a single episode following her surgery.

Throughout the rest of her hospitalization, the patient was
mostly hypertensive for which her blood pressure medication
was titrated and currently include Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.
day; Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q. day; Amlodipine 7.5 mg p.o.
twice a day.  On the second postoperative day, the patient
ruled in for a myocardial infarction with a small troponin
leak at 3.4.  At that time, she was fully anti-coagulated on
Coumadin and a low dose of aspirin was initiated.  The
patient was continued on her beta blocker.

2.  Respiratory Failure:  Following the surgery, the patient
was extubated on postoperative day number two.  She was able
to ventilate well and required supplemental oxygen for
saturations in high 80s.  Over the course of the
hospitalization, her oxygen requirement slowly decreased.
Due to the history of the saturations on admission, the
patient was presumed to have a community-acquired pneumonia
for which she was treated with Levofloxacin and Flagyl.
Today is day number five of her antibiotics and she is to
complete a 14 day course.

Her sputum cultures times three remained no growth.  Her
urine culture great Klebsiella oxytoca sensitive to
everything, including Levofloxacin.

For her ulcerative colitis, the patient was continued on
Sulfasalazine.  She had persistent guaiac positive stools,
but no bloody diarrhea that would be indicative of a flare up
of her ulcerative colitis.

3.  Hematologic:  The patient has had chronic anemia for
which she is on iron supplements.  Iron supplements were
continued throughout the hospitalization.  On the third
hospitalization day, the patient was noted to have a drop in
her hematocrit from the 30s to 23, for which she received two
units of packed red blood cells.  A discussion with daughters
was undertaken about possible GI evaluation, and the decision
was made currently to proceed with conservative management
and supportive treatment only.  Her hematocrit stabilized at
28 to 30 range.

On her admission, the patient was noted to be hyponatremic.
Based on the urine osmolarity and serum osmolality, it was
felt to be secondary to syndrome of inappropriate
antidiuretic hormone.  With fluid restriction to one liter,
the patient's sodium increased to 134.

In respect to her postoperative care, the patient was
maintained on Coumadin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis
with a goal INR of 1.5 to 2.0.  She received Kefzol for a
total of six doses.

Following Physical Therapy evaluation, she was allowed full
weight bearing as tolerated and she is to continue Physical
Therapy at the rehabilitation center.  At the present time,
she is wearing a knee immobilizer.

After extensive discussion with her daughter, the patient's
code status was established as "DO NOT INTUBATE", "DO NOT
RESUSCITATE".
