History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 71 y.o male with history of [**Known lastname 15196**] disease
s/p aortic valve replacement, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with
EF of 30% who presented to the hospital after two episodes of VT
that occured on the day of admission.  The first episode occured
after physical exercise with his visiting physical therapist
during which time the patient syncopized.  Pacer interrogation
showed that the VT was at a rate of 286 bpm, terminated by 25
joule shock.  The second episode also caused the patient to
syncopize, and interrogation found the that the patient was in
VT/VF in the afternoon at a rate of 210-220 beats, accellerated
to 300-310 with afib morphology, terminated by 34.5 joule shock.
Both times, the patient was in a sitting or supine position, and
he did not fall down or hit his head.

Of note, the patient reports that over the past several months
he has noticed a progressive decline in his overall health.  He
has been increasing short of breath with decreased exercise
tolerance overall, with increased overall weakness.
.
On review of systems, he denied any increased orthopnea, PND,
chest pain, fevers, chills, recent flu-like illnesses or rashes.
 No nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  He has in fact lost weight
over the past several months, going from 330lbs to 315lbs.  All
of the other review of systems were negative.

Cardiology Report Cardiac Cath Study Date of [**2174-1-7**]

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary amgiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated no obstructive coronary artery disease. The LMCA
was
normal. The LAD, LCx and RCA were large with minor luminal
irregularities.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left
sided
filling pressures with RVEDP of 13 mm Hg and mean PCWP of 25 mm
Hg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. No significant coronary artery disease.

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2174-1-4**] 6:07
PM

FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest reveals an AICD with
stable
position of three intact leads. There is stable cardiomegaly.
Again, there
is obscuration of the left lower lobe due to the enlarged heart.
However, the
lungs appear grossly clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
is
identified. Status post median sternotomy.

IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the chest with stable
cardiomegaly. Stable
position of AICD and three leads.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2174-1-4**]  6:12:06 PM


Sinus rhythm with A-V conduction delay, atrial sensed and
ventricular paced
rhythm, intermittent atrial pacing. Since the previous tracing
of same date
ventricular ectopy is absent. Otherwise, baseline artifact on
previous tracing
makes comparison difficult.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 year old male with history of atrial tachycardias, s/p failed
cardioversion and failure of dofetelide, non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy with VT, started on amiodarone.
.
# Ventricular Tachycardia/ Ventricular Fibrillation -
Patient's cardiac enzymes were stable, not trending upwards, and
Cardiac Catheterization showed only very mild coronary disease,
ruling out ischemia as a cause for his VT. Patient was started
on amiodarone, completed a 10gm load then continued on 300mg
daily.  He was monitored on telemetry and showed no signs of
prolonged VT.
.
# Chronic Systolic Congestive Heart failure -
Patient's ejection fraction on last Echocardiogram was 30%.
Patient described increased abdominal girth but appeared
euvolemic on exam. CXR on admission did not indicate fluid
overload. He was continued on his home dose of lasix 80mg twice
daily and spironolactone.
.
# Anticoagulation for Mechanical Aortic Valve -
Warfarin was held, and patient was bridged with heparin drip for
Cardiac Catheterization; warfarin was restarted after Cath with
heparin bridge until INR reached >2.5.  Goal INR 2.5-3.5 for
mechanical aortic valve.  He was discharged on his home warfarin
regimen of alternating 8mg with 9mg; however, because amiodarone
is known to interact with warfarin metabolism, patient may
require adjustment of his warfarin dose at home.  He has a home
INR monitoring device, and his coumadin is managed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
as an outpatient.
.
#Hypertension -
Blood pressure was well controlled on home dose losartan 25mg
daily and carvedilol 12.5mg twice daily.
.
#Chronic Kidney disease -
Patient's creatinine was 1.4 on admission and relatively stable
until discharge when it peaked at 1.7, likely pre-renal.  He
should follow up with his primary care physician in the next
couple of weeks to have his electrolytes and creatinine
rechecked.
.
#Anemia, chronic -
Patient's hematocrit remained stable at 33, normocytic.
.
#Hyperlipidemia -
Patient was continued on atorvastatin 80mg.
