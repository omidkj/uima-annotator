HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 46708**] is a
61-year-old female with recent diagnosis of irresectable
anaplastic left temporoparietal grade III oligoastrocytoma,
status post daily radiation therapy and Solu-Medrol times one
month, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
who was admitted to Neurology on [**2178-1-6**] for worsening
aphasia, gait, and vomiting, in preparation for home services
versus hospice.  MRI had shown slightly worsening of
vasogenic edema surrounding the posterior parietal aspect of
the left temporoparietal lobe with a question of invasion in
the posterior hemisphere of the left lateral ventricle, a few
millimeter midline shift unchanged, possible calcification
for bleed.

After admission, Decadron was increased to 6 mg p.o. q. eight
hours.  She gradually became less responsive.  On admission,
she had still been somewhat able to follow-up commands and
speak some words.  She also became tachypneic with
progressive 02 requirements.  She was unable to be brought to
Radiology to obtain head CT and CTA to rule out herniation
and pulmonary embolism respectively due to instability.  EKG
and chest x-ray were without change or significant pathology.
No choking noticed during giving her meds with applesauce.
No gag reflex.  She did have copious yellow secretions with
blood-tinged sputum.  No papilledema according to the
Neurology resident.
