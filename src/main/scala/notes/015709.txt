Abdominal U/S [**2-1**]:
Unchanged cholelithiasis with mild gallbladder wall thickening
which may
relate to underlying chronic cholecystitis. No definite edema,
pericholecystic fluid collections, or son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name2 (NI) 515**] sign
was obtained. If there is continued high clinical suspicion and
alteration of care will occur, a repeat gallbladder nuclear
study could be performed

CT Torso [**2-1**]:
1. No evidence of aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism. Small
bilateral
pleural effusions with bilateral lower lobe atelectases.
2. Hyperenhancement of gallbladder mucosa with wall
edema/thickening and
peri-inflammatory changes of the surrounding fat. The degree of
edema has
increased from prior exams and the inflammatory changes are new.
Findings
likely reflect acute-on-chronic cholecystitis. No definite
choledocholithiasis, although the extrahepatic CBD is dilated
(can evaluate with MRCP if needed). Small contained
microperforation appears to have been present in [**2136**].
3. Sub acute to chronic right-sided rib fractures. Wedge
compression
deformities of T12 and L1 are new from [**2136**].
4. Mild wall edema involving the decompressed segment of hepatic

flexure/transverse colon which is presumed to be reactive from
the surrounding inflammatory changes of the gallbladder. No
findings of bowel obstruction.
5. Atherosclerotic disease within the coronary circulation and
aorta.
6. Multinodular goiter. Can consider dedicated evaluation with
thryoid
ultrasound on non emergent basis.

Echocardiogram [**2-2**]:
Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
regional biventricular systolic function. Mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation. Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.

CXR [**2-4**]:
A new PICC terminates in the right atrium. Pullback 2 cm
suggested for optimal positioning. Otherwise the appearance of
the chest is
not changed over the last three hours. Right percutaneous
nephrostomy tube is unchanged in position. There remain
bilateral pleural effusions and basilar atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the surgical floor with acute
cholecystitis.  She was started on admit for resuscitation and
IV antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and flagyl), diet NPO.  A
percutaneous cholecystostomy tube was placed without any
difficulty.

[**2-2**]- vancomycin was added to antibiotics, continued
cipro/flagyl, diet advanced to clears

[**2-3**] - the patient developed rapid atrial fibrillation
unresponsive to lopressor, she was transferred to the ICU for a
diltiazem drip.  Cardiology was consulted.  They recommended
aspirin, diltiazem drip.  Continued clears, antibiotics

[**2-4**] - converted to sinus rhythm overnight, changed to oral
medications, lopressor 25 [**Hospital1 **], diet advanced to regular and
transferred to the surgical floor on telemetry, PICC line placed

[**2-5**] discontinued cipro/flagyl, continued vancomycin for MRSA
positive cultures in both blood and bile, foley catheter
removed, TLSO brace in place, working with physical therapy

[**2-6**] - speech and swallow consult obtained for difficulty
swallowing

[**2-7**] - Pt to take nectar thick liquids and solids, Lopressor
changed to 25PO TID, pressure tolerating

[**2-8**]  - Pt tolerating PO, pain controlled, rhythm sinus,
therapeutic on Vanc at current dose. Decision pt stable for
discharge
