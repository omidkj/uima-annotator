HYPOTENSION IN SETTING OF RP BLEED

Midline placement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 yo M w/ PMH CAD s/p CABG x4 in [**2163**], CHF
(EF-20%), VT s/p ablation and ICD in [**2-16**], HIT, who presented to
an OSH [**2178-12-12**] with hypotension and shock. Of note, he had been
at [**Hospital1 18**] [**10-16**] for infected ICD wire (likely originating from
foot infection), resulting in ICD wire removal. He was d/c'd to
rehab for planned 6 wk course of vanco (to be completed
[**2178-12-13**]). He presented to the OSH from rehab after the sudden
onset of L flank pain with SBP 50s. He was also hypoxic,
requiring NRB. On abd CT at the OSH, he was found to have an
enlarging L sided RP hematoma orginating from L kidney. Of note,
he had received one dose of fondaparinux on admission for his
h/o HIT. He initially required pressors, which were weaned off
[**12-14**]. He received 11U PRBCs, 3U FFP, 10mg Vit K x2, DDAVP
22.5mg. He was seen by urology at OSH, who recommended
conservative treatment for RP bleed.
.
He was also felt to have infection/sepsis contributing to his
hypotension, with lactate 8.0, and was started on vanco and
imipenem on admission. He was found to have GPC in clusters
growing from his PICC line, and this was removed. In addition,
coccyx wound cultures grew out acinetobacter, sensitive only to
aminoglycosides. The patient had WBC of 14.9 with L shift, no
fever noted. The patient also presented with plts of 174K which
trended down to 34K, so his mexiletine was discontinued as a
possible source of thrombocytopenia.
.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2178-12-15**]. Vancomycin was continued
for GPC PICC line infection, but other abx were discontinued. He
was also found to have a pneumonia, and was started on
ciprofloxacin. He has received 4U PRBC here, as well as 1U
platelets. His [**Date Range **] was resumed, after discussion with EP.
His [**Date Range **] dose was also increased to 40mg daily, due to a
gout flare.
.
ROS: Currently, denies CP, SOB, cough, F/C, back/flank pain, abd
pain, N/V, diarrhea, dysuria, dizziness.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2178-12-18**]**

   WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2178-12-18**]):    No significant growth.
.
Imaging:
MRI Abdomen [**12-16**]:
FINDINGS: There is a large, approximately 30 cm in craniocaudad
dimension, perinephric hematoma that extends retroperitoneally
into the pelvis. This retroperitoneal collection displaces the
left kidney superiorly. There is a subcapsular component of this
large perinephric hematoma. No active extravasation is
visualized at the time of the examination. There was a delayed
nephrogram to the left kidney, however the arterial and venous
flow is preserved. Coronal reconstructions suggest that the left
kidney is intact. There is no history of trauma, this finding
may be secondary to rupture of a complicated cyst or bleeding
from lipid poor angiomyolipoma with coagulation deficiencies
causing excessive bleeding. On the prior examination of
[**2178-11-4**], no definitive angiomyolipoma was seen.

Post simple and hemorrhagic cysts are visualized within the
right kidney. Limited visualization of the adrenal glands, liver
and pancreas are unremarkable. There has been interval
development of multiple tiny subcapsular non-enhancing foci
within the spleen, which are not seen on the prior examination.
Question residual from infection in this patient with history of
MRSA bacteremia.

Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations as well as subtraction images
were essential in demonstrating multiple perspectives for this
dynamic series.

IMPRESSION:
1. Large perinephric hematoma extending into the pelvis with
contiguity with the left kidney. In the absence of trauma, this
may be a complication of a ruptured cyst versus a bleeding lipid
poor angiomyolipoma. [**Date Range **] flow to the left kidney is
preserved and the left kidney appears intact on coronal
reformatted images.
2. New tiny foci seen in the subcapsular aspect of the spleen,
suggesting residual of prior infection in this patient with
history of MRSA bacteremia.
.
Renal US [**12-16**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Edematous and distended left kidney without evidence of
Doppler flow, could be secondary to ischemia, i.e., venous
obstruction as a result of the hematoma. Further evaluation with
MRI is recommended.
2. Multiple right renal cysts with echogenic parenchyma
representing parenchymal disease.
3. Small ascites and right pleural effusion.
.
CXR PA/LAT [**12-22**]:
PA and lateral radiograph. Comparison [**11-10**] and [**2178-12-16**], as well as CT [**2176-9-4**].
Left lower lobe consolidation and effusion are unchanged. There
may be minimal atelectasis in the medial right lung base.
Mediastinal contours are stable. Calcification in the
interventricular septum and the myocardial left ventricular apex
are noted on the lateral view. Pulmonary vasculature is stable
and within normal limits.
There is an old healed right posterior seventh rib fracture.
IMPRESSION: No change in left lower lobe pleural effusion and
consolidation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Retroperitoneal Bleed: The patient was initially hypotense
requiring aggressive volume resusitation.  The patient's Hct on
admission was 23.  He was given a total of 11 units PRBCs as
well as 5 units
