Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2.There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with antero septal and septal hypokinesis. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex (>4mm)
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. 6. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine and
epinephrine and is being AV paced.
1. Bi ventricular function is preserved.
2. Severe MR is seen, some [**Male First Name (un) **] is noted. MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**] with [**Male First Name (un) **]
therapy.
3. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
4. Other findings are unchanged

Final Report

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2158-5-26**] 1:01 PM

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST

Reason: r/o infection source
Field of view: 36

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
88 year old woman with s/p CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o infection source
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CT TORSO

INDICATION: 88-year-old woman status post CABG, rule out
infectious source.

CT TORSO WITHOUT IV CONTRAST TECHNIQUE: Multidetector scanning
is performed from the thoracic inlet through the symphysis
without intravenous contrast. There is no axillary, mediastinal
or hilar lymphadenopathy. A tracheostoma is identified. There
are [**Hospital 1192**] bilateral pleural effusions. There is atelectasis
in the lower lobes bilaterally. There are ground-glass opacities
in the upper lobes bilaterally, left more than right.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The contour of the right
lobe of the liver is quite lobular. No focal lesions are seen.
The spleen is unremarkable. The pancreas is atrophic. The
gallbladder contains multiple stones. There is no definite
evidence for pericholecystic fat stranding. The adrenal glands
are normal. In the right kidney, there is a staghorn calculus in
the lower pole. There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The
small bowel is unremarkable. A G-tube is present. The ascending
colon is dilated measuring 5.8 cm. Mild dilatation is also noted
in the transverse and descending colon.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The sigmoid colon is
collapsed. There is no evidence for an obstructing lesion. The
small bowel is normal. There is no free fluid in the pelvis and
no pelvic lymphadenopathy is noted. There is anasarca in the
soft tissues.

IMPRESSION:
1. [**Hospital **] bilateral pleural effusions and ground-glass
opacities in the upper lobes bilaterally, left more than right.
These findings most likely represent pulmonary edema. However,
an infectious process cannot be entirely excluded for the
parenchymal opacities and followup after treatment is
recommended to ensure resolution.
2. Dilated ascending to descending colon likely represents
ileus. There is no wall thickening to suggest ischemia.
3. Dilated gallbladder with multiple gallstones, however, no
pericholecystic fat stranding to suggest cholecystitis.
4. Small amount of ascites in the abdomen and anasarca also
likely reflecting fluid overload.
5. Nodular contour of the liver concerning for cirrhosis.
6. Staghorn calculus in the right kidney. No evidence for
obstruction.

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2158-6-10**] 2:19 PM

CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT

Reason: ? infiltrate, check line position

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
88 year old woman s/p CABG, rising wbc count, Right subclavian
CVL placed
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
? infiltrate, check line position
CHEST

HISTORY: CABG, elevate white blood count cell count subclavian
line placement.

One supine view.

Comparison with the previous study of [**2158-6-7**].

There is continued evidence of small pleural effusions.
There is biapical pleural thickening, as before.
The patient is status post median sternotomy, and mediastinal
structures are unchanged. A tracheostomy tube and left PICC line
remain in place. A right- sided central line has been withdrawn.
A right subclavian catheter has been introduced and terminates
at the level of the cavoatrial junction. There is no other
significant interval change.

IMPRESSION: Line placement as described.


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted on [**5-11**]. IV NTG continued and IV heaprin started for
recurrent angina. Dental clearance obtained. Carotid U/S showed
[**Country **] 40-60%, [**Doctor First Name 3098**] 60-70%. DNR/DNI suspended for consent for
sugery/anesthesia. Had additional angina on drips on [**5-13**] and
was taken to the OR emergently. She had a cardiac arrest
requiring CPR during line placement and an emergency CABG x2
done by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]. Transferred to the CVICU in fair condition.
Developed Afib on [**5-16**] treated with amiodarone. Remained
hypotensive requiring pressors. Pancultured for an elevated WBC
count. Unable to wean from vent.Dobhoff tube placed. Lasix drip
started. Mutiple skin tears noted and wound care nurse as well
as plastic surgery consulted. Renal consult done for acute renal
failure. IV heparin restarted on POD #7. Thoracic surgery
consulted on POD #9 for trach/PEG. Vit. K given in preparation
and trach and PEG done by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on POD #10. Tube feeds
started the following day. ID consult done [**5-26**]. IV flagyl/PO
