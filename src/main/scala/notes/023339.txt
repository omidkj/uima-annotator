CT Head [**2106-7-15**]:
FINDINGS:
A large lesion in the left posterior fossa (2:9) is ill-defined
with
approximately dimensions of 4.2 x 3.7 cm.  Intra- versus
extra-axial location of this mass is difficult to determine.
Hypodensity in the surrounding cerebellum is present, likely
representing edema, with a focal hyperdensity superiorly (2:12).
 Mass causes mild effacement of the fourth ventricle which is
displaced towards the right and asymmetry of the quadrigeminal
plate cistern.  No downward or upward herniation is visualized.
The suprasellar cistern appears patent.  The lateral ventricles
and third ventricle appear normal in size and configuration.  No
abnormality is seen of the subjacent osseous structures.

Well-defined hypodensity in the anterior left frontal lobe is
compatible with an old infarction.  Periventricular white matter
hypodensities are compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic
disease.  No fracture is identified.  The visualized paranasal
sinuses, middle ear cavities, and mastoid air cells appear
patent.


IMPRESSION:
Large left posterior fossa lesion, most compatible with a mass.
Intra- versus extra-axial location is difficult to assess.
Probable adjacent cerebellar edema with a focal hyperdensity
superiorly.  The lesion causes mild effacement and right lateral
shift of the fourth ventricle and asymmetry of the quadrigeminal
plate cistern.

CT Torso [**2106-7-16**]:

IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of metastatic disease in the chest, abdomen or
pelvis.
2.  Post-surgical changes within the left lower lobe from prior
resection with adjacent atelectatic lung.  There is a small
adjacent loculated pleural effusion.
3.  Prominence of the intrahepatic biliary ducts and common bile
duct may
relate to gallbladder resection, however, correlation with liver
function
tests is recommended to exclude obstruction.
4.  Intermediate density right renal cyst is likely
proteinaceous, however, further characterization with ultrasound
is recommended.


MRI Brain [**2106-7-16**]:
FINDINGS:  There is a heterogeneously enhancing mass centered in
the left
cerebellar hemisphere measuring 4.1 x 3.6 cm (10:7).  There is
extensive edema surrounding this lesion, which extends into
brainstem, exerts mass effect on the fourth ventricle.  No
hydrocephalus.  Mild cerebellar tonsillar herniation is noted.
Susceptibility artifact within this lesion signifies hemorrhage.
 There is associated restricted diffusion within this lesion,
which likely relates to hypercellularity.  No additional
intracranial lesion is identified. Sulci and ventricles are
slightly prominent, likely age-related involutional changes.
Bilateral FLAIR hyperintensities in subcortical, deep, and
periventricular white matter distribution likely reflect sequela
of small vessel ischemic disease.  Basal cisterns are patent.
Globes are intact.  Paranasal sinuses are clear.  Principal
intracranial flow voids are preserved.
IMPRESSION:
A large heterogeneously enhancing, hemorrhagic mass centered in
the left
cerebellar hemisphere with surrounding edema and mass effect, as
described above, is most compatible with metastatic disease.  No
additional intracranial lesions identified.

CXR [**2106-7-19**]
The Port-A-Cath catheter has been inserted through the right
subclavian
approach with its tip at the level of superior mid SVC.  The
post-surgical
changes in the left lower lung are demonstrated.  No
pneumothorax is seen.  No interval increase in pleural effusion
demonstrated.

CT head [**2106-7-20**]
Expected small amount of blood at the surgical site in the left
cerebellar
hemisphere with expected postoperative pneumocephalus.  No
hydrocephalus.

MRI [**2106-7-21**]
Post-operative changes related to left suboccipital craniotomy
and resection of the left cerebellar mass.  Small amount of
hemorrhage, pneumocephalus, and minimal hyperenhancement within
the resection bed, is likely post-surgical, however follow-up
with MRI with and without contrast is reccommended.

[**2106-7-23**] NCHCT:
In comparison to [**2106-7-20**] exam, there is interval removal of
external
ventricular drain.  Small amount of pneumocephalus has improved
since prior.  Post-surgical changes related to suboccipital
craniotomy and resection of left cerebellar mass are noted.
Hyperattenuating rim in the resection bed likely represents
small amount of post-surgical hemorrhage, unchanged.  No new
intracranial hemorrhage.


Brief Hospital Course:
72 F with h/o small cell lung cancer s/p chemo/XRT (finished
[**3-/2106**]) and recent LLL wedge resection ([**2106-6-22**] with biopsy
+adenoca at [**Hospital1 34**]), COPD, [**Hospital 2754**] transferred from [**Hospital3 5365**]
where she presented with frontal headache x 3 for cerebellar
mass.
She was admitted to the Neurosurgery service under Dr[**Name (NI) 9034**]
care. She was started on Dexamethasone 4mg every 6hrs.

On [**7-16**], she had a Brain MRI/WAND study that confirmed the
cerebellar mass, associated edema was noted, but the 4th
ventricle remained patent. On admission, her serum NA was 127,
she was given IVF but her serum NA worsened, going down to 125.
A CT torso was done which was negative. On [**7-17**], her serum NA
remained low (126) and IVF were stopped and she was fluid
restricted. Her serum NA came up to 130 by the evening. Neuro
Oncology and Radiation oncology consults were requested. She
continued on the Dexamethason
