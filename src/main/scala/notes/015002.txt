ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS:  Intrauterine pregnancy at 31 weeks, 5
days gestation; preterm labor; positive HIV status; history
of endocarditis resulting in right-sided heart failure.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Status post primary Cesarean section.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 34-year-old
woman gravida 2, para 0 who was admitted on [**2115-2-21**]
at 31 weeks 5 days gestation with preterm labor with the
above-mentioned history.

The patient has been followed for prenatal care by me.  Her
prenatal issues were as follows.

Positive HIV status with last CD4 count in [**2114-11-30**] of
559--the viral lode on [**2114-12-17**] was 83.  The patient
has been diagnosed with positive HIV status for over five
years.  During this time, the patient refused to be on
antiretroviral therapy.  During this pregnancy, however, she
was counseled extensively regarding the decreased incidence
of HIV transmission to the fetus with antiretroviral therapy
and low viral lode.  The patient agreed to be placed on
Combivir one tablet p.o. b.i.d. as well as Viramune 200 mg
p.o. b.i.d.  The patient had been compliant with her
medication.

Hepatitis C--the patient was diagnosed approximately two
years ago.  Her liver function tests during this pregnancy
had been stable.

Multiple history of endocarditis--the patient has been
hospitalized numerous times and her most recent episode was
approximately two years ago.  At that time, the patient was
found to have severe mitral valve regurgitation.  Her most
recent echocardiogram which was performed during this
pregnancy demonstrated minimal right ventricular systolic
function.  Her left ventricular function was intact.

History of substance abuse--the patient is currently on a
methadone treatment program requiring 95 mg b.i.d.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Left knee surgery, right arm surgery
for drainage of abscess.

MEDICATIONS:  Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d., Combivir one tablet
p.o. b.i.d., Viramune 200 mg p.o. b.i.d., Xanax 0.5 mg p.o.
q.h.s., methadone 95 mg p.o. b.i.d., Bactrim DS one tablet
q.d., folic acid 2 mg p.o. b.i.d., prenatal vitamins at one
tablet p.o. b.i.d., ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o. b.i.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The patient was in no
acute distress.  The patient was afebrile with stable vital
signs.  General examination was within normal limits.
Cardiovascular examination demonstrated [**4-5**] holosystolic
murmur with possible S4 gallop.  Abdominal examination
demonstrated soft, nontender abdomen with gravid uterus.
Extremities revealed trace pedal edema.  Vaginal examination
demonstrated 1.5 cm dilatation with 70% effacement.  Fetal
heart rate was in the 130s with variability.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for observation
with initial administration of magnesium sulfate for preterm
labor.  The patient was also given betamethasone earlier
during this pregnancy.  The patient was monitored on the
antenatal floor and was subsequently weaned off magnesium
sulfate.  The patient remained stable with intermittent
contractions but without cervical change.  The fetal status
was closely monitored during her admission and remained
stable.  During the hospitalization, however, the patient
continued to have irregular intermittent contractions
throughout and the fetus continued to remain in breech
presentation.

On [**2115-3-7**], the patient underwent primary Cesarean
section for continued uterine contractions at 33 weeks and 4
days of gestation.  The Cesarean section was performed under
spinal anesthesia without complication.

The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit
for 24 hours of observation.  The patient was subsequently
transferred to the postpartum floor.  Her postoperative
course was uneventful.  She remained stable cardiovascularly
and recovered well from surgery.  The patient was discharged
on [**2115-3-12**] on postoperative day #5.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Combivir one tablet p.o. b.i.d.,
Viramune 200 mg p.o. b.i.d., Digoxin 0.25 mg p.o. q.d.,
methadone 95 mg p.o. b.i.d.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  The patient is to follow up with me for
postpartum care.  She is also to be followed up by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8173**] for her cardiac issues.  The patient also will be
followed in the Methadone [**Hospital 8174**] Clinic as well as by
the Infectious Disease Service for her HIV issues.
