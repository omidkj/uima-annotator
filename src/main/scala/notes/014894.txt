Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Codeine / Dilaudid

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pressure, syncope, mobile echodensity on anterior mitral
leaflet on ECHO [**2130-1-17**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2130-1-23**] AVR ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 6158**] [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 923**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9041**] porcine valve)


History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 86 yo woman with PMH HTN, hyperlipidemia, aortic
stenosis, h/o chest pain and syncope, who presents after having
ECHO on [**2129-1-17**] that demonstrates mitral valve mass.
Patient has been seeing Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in Cardiology clinic for a
2nd opinion (she is generally followed in [**State 108**], initially saw
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**7-21**]) for c/o two- to three-year history of
exertional and one-year history of rest chest discomfort, as
well as episodes of syncope. Due to these complaints, a cardiac
cath was perfomed here in [**8-21**] that showed normal coronary
arteries along with moderate mitral regurgitation and
mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 20 mmHg
(Aortic valve area = 0.6cm2). She also had mildly elevated wedge
pressures to 19 and her overall ejection fraction was 53%. It
was thought, therefore, that the patient did not have a cardiac
cause for her chest discomfort.
However, the patient had some continued episodes of chest
discomfort over the next 4-5 months, worsening over the past
month to the point where the episodes were accompanied by
shortness of breath that severely limited her functional
capacity (she could hardly walk a block without stopping to
catch her breath), and substantial weakness. She also had a
couple episodes of syncope during this time. These complaints
were evaluated in [**State 108**] where the patient had a repeat ECHO
and was told that she would need to have an aortic valve
replacement. She again returned to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for a 2nd
opinion, and her follow up appointment with him was [**2130-1-17**].
Preceeding the appointment, the patient had a repeat ECHO
([**2130-1-17**]) that demonstrated a new mitral valve (anterior leaflet)
mobile mass, aortic stenosis unchanged. Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 15020**] note
from the visit that day, he believed her symptoms were unlikely
due to critical aortic stenosis and were instead likely due to a
combination of poorly controlled hypertension, diastolic
dysfunction, mild anemia, mild-moderate mitral regurgitation,
and mild-moderate aortic stenosis. She was treated with
increasing the HCTZ from 12.5mg daily to 25mg daily and adding
back nifedipine for improved blood pressure control. He also
stated that he would carefully review the ECHO and the mass that
it demonstrated, as well as the prior cardiac catheterization to
determine whether or not the patient should get a repeat
catheterization.
Upon review, demonstrates 1.5 x 1.5cm mobile mass/vegetation.
The mass prolapses into the LVOT without evidence of
obstruction. The patient was sent to the hospital for admission
for further w/u of the mitral valve mobile mass, and repeat
cardiac catheterization in AM.

ago.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
86 year old woman s/p AVR and ct removal
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o ptx
PORTABLE CHEST, 9:40 A.M., [**1-25**].

INDICATION: Status post AVR with chest tube removal.

FINDINGS: Compared with [**2130-1-23**], multiple tubes and catheters
have been removed. No pneumothorax is seen.

There are small bilateral pleural effusions and patchy
atelectasis at the left base medially.

The lungs are otherwise grossly clear. No CHF.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report

UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US LEFT

Reason: evaluate for clot in LUE

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
86 year old woman s/p AVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate for clot in LUE
INDICATION: Status post aortic valve repair, evaluate for upper
extremity clot.

COMPARISON: None.

LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale, color, and pulse
Doppler evaluation of the left internal jugular, left
subclavian, left axillary, left brachial veins were performed.
Eccentric nonocclusive thrombus is demonstrated within the left
axillary and one of the left brachial veins containing a
punctate focus of echogenicity suggestive of calcification.
These findings are likely representative chronic nonocclusive
thrombus. Left subclavian and left internal jugular veins
demonstrate normal color flow and waveforms. Normal
compressibility is present within the left internal jugular
vein. The left cephalic and basilic veins were not visualized.

IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombus within the left axillary and
left brachial veins, likely chronic.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
