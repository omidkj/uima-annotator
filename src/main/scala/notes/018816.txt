100% in room air.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Lungs are

creatinine 2.7, glucose 115.  Prothrombin time 14.9, partial
thromboplastin time 33.6, INR 1.5.  Urinalysis negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to Medicine
service and placed in the Intensive Care Unit.  Surgery was
consulted.  Nasogastric tube was placed.  The patient was
typed and crossed and transfused to keep her hematocrit above
30.0.  Red blood cell scan was performed.  The patient's
coagulopathy was reversed with Vitamin K and fresh frozen
plasma.  On hospital day number two, the patient is afebrile
and vital signs are stable.  The patient continued to have
some bright red blood per rectum, transfused to keep
hematocrit above 30.0.  Bleeding scan localized bleeding into
the area of the cecum.  Gastroenterology was also consulted
who at that time recommended correcting coagulopathy and
conservative management.  The patient remained in the
Intensive Care Unit for observation.  Her bleeding has
stopped by itself.  She was transferred to the floor on
[**2142-6-22**].  The patient again started bleeding with bright red
blood per rectum and hematocrit dropped (anemia).  The
patient was again typed and crossed and transfused to keep
hematocrit above 30.0.  Surgery was reconsulted.  At that
time, the patient's bleeding stopped by itself.  Surgery
requested cardiology consultation.  The patient had a
Swan-Ganz catheter placed for cardiac monitoring.  She was
also started on Lopressor for cardiac prophylaxis.  However,
overnight, the patient started bleeding again.  She was then
taken to the operating room on [**2142-6-24**], for right
hemicolectomy.  Please see operative note for details.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back
to Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.

Postoperative day number one, the patient is afebrile and
vital signs are stable.  She is diuresing well and unable to
wean off ventilator due to edema.  She was started on TPN for
failure to thrive.  She was also placed on Vancomycin,
Levofloxacin and Flagyl (Vancomycin for Staphylococcus aureus
urinary tract infection).  She also was started on Lasix,
however, she did not really respond well to it and it was
stopped.  The patient continued diuresis.  The patient had a
couple episodes of bradycardia down to high 30s, low 40s.
Her Lopressor was stopped which improved her bradycardia
(heart rate in high 50s and low 60s).  The patient self
extubated on postoperative day number three.  Nasogastric
tube was removed.  She was started on sips and advanced to
clears which she was tolerating well.  She continued on TPN.
She started with physical therapy.  She continued on
Vancomycin for urinary tract infection until second urine
culture came back positive.

On postoperative day number four, the patient is afebrile and
vital signs are stable. She was started on p.o. medications.
She was also restarted on Cozaar for blood pressure control.
Second culture came back as MSSA.  The patient was switched
to Oxacillin.  The patient was transferred to regular floor.
Her Foley was removed.  At renal service suggestion, she was
started on Epogen and Zaroxolyn.  Her diet was advanced to
regular diabetic diet which she was tolerating well.  She was
walking with physical therapy.

On postoperative day five and six, the patient is afebrile
and vital signs are stable.  She is ambulating a few steps
and moving from bed to chair with physical therapy.  The
wound is clean, dry and intact.  She is confused at times,
however, this is the patient's baseline.  Otherwise, she is
stable with no concerns, no active issues at this time.
