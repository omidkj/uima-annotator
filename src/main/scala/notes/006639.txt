Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8115**]
Chief Complaint:
Right facial swelling



Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 yo F with PMH significant for Breast CA with last
chemotherapy on [**12-16**] (Taxotere, carboplatin, and Herceptin)
with an ANC 686 now with increased right sided facial swelling,
erythema, warmth, and pain for 1 day.

The pt was in her usual state of health until 1 week prior when
she began to notice oral lesions occuring over the lips and on
the oral mucosa.  These lesions were painful and were limiting
PO intake.  She was reportedly perscribed Acyclovir by her
oncologist to treat presumed HSV infection, however she never
filled the perscription.  Over the course of the week the
lesions largely improved with decreased pain and erythema.
However, on the morning of admission she awoke with right-sided
facial swelling, redness, and pain.  She felt feverish and her
temperature measured at home was 100.9.  She called her
oncologist who recomended that she go to the ED.

Of note, Pt reports change in vision in the right eye which
started 3 days before admission.  She reports a "wavey line" in
her field of view.  It does not interfere with her acuity, she
denies diplopia, pain with movement, seeing halos, and
associated headaces.

Also of note, pt noted diarrhea begining on Monday, which
largely resolved by Wednesday.  On Friday she was started on
Cipro and since then diarrhea has completely resolved.

In the ED Febrile to 101.7, HR 126, 175/90 RR 18 SpO2 99%RA.  Pt
received Unasyn and Penacillin G.  Pt reported substernal Chest
pain along with sinus tachycardia that subsided as tachycardia
resolved. Facial swellin was evaluated with CT face, which was
concerning for subcutaneous air,raising concern for necrotizing
process.  ENT evaluation found oral lesions which may be
responsible for the entrance of air into her facial soft tissue
structures.  ID was conslted, and recommended daptomycin,
meropenem, and clindamycin.

Adriamycin/Cytoxan and 7 weekly Taxotere treatments.  Arimidex
since [**1-29**]
- right mastectomy [**2183-3-26**] when mammogram showed new
calcifications
6) GERD
7) Low back pain s/p placement of neural stimulator
8) Right shoulder osteomyelitis:
- Right humeral fracture [**5-30**] s/p ORIF
- [**2183-7-27**] MRSA bacteremia from chemo port -> right septic
shoulder/osteomyelitis
- initially tx with linezolid, stopped due to thrombocytopenia,
changed to daptomycin changed to synercid/rifampin due to
daptomycin resistance. Synercid/rifampin caused pancytopenia, so
she was changed to PO minocycline.
- [**3-31**] right shoulder joint and upper humerus removed by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **] at [**Hospital1 2025**] and antibiotic spacer inserted. Intra-op cultures
grew 1 colony of MRSA
--> desensitized to vancomycin and d/c [**2184-3-26**] on planned 6 week
course of vancomycin prior to shoulder replacement, which would
be followed by an additional 4-6 weeks of vancomycin
