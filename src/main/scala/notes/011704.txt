Pertinent Results:
ECG Study Date of [**2153-12-26**]  10:25:14 PM
Sinus tachycardia
Right atrial abnormality
S1 Q3 T3 pattern
Inferior and right precordial lead ST-T wave abnormalities
Clinical correlation is suggested for possible RV overload
No previous tracing for comparison

BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS PORT  [**2153-12-28**] 1:24 PM
Equivocal minimal thrombus in the right popliteal vein,
age-indeterminant, with no evidence of proximal extension. The
appearance may represent possible minimal acute, subacute, or
chronic thrombus. No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in the
left lower extremity. The findings were discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] at 4:40 p.m. on [**2153-12-28**].

 ECHO Study Date of [**2153-12-28**]
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. A small patent foramen
ovale is present.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated. There is
severe global
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
diastolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
overload.
4. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
5. There is a small pericardial effusion.

ECHO Study Date of [**2154-1-9**]
IMPRESSION: Markedly dilated RV cavity with free wall
hypokinesis. Normal LV
cavity size and systolic function. Abnormal septal motion c/w RV

pressure/volume overload. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Small
pericardial
effusion.
Compared to the study (tape reviewed) dated [**2153-12-28**], the RV
function has
improved but still remains dilated.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C &RECONS  [**2154-1-24**] 12:00 PM
CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is multifocal air-space
disease, with areas of air-space disease within the left upper
lobe, left lower lobe, lingula, right upper lobe and right lower
lobe. No cavitary lesion is identified within the left lung to
correspond to findings on recent chest x-ray.
There is a small amount of fluid within the major fissure on the
right. There is bibasilar atelectasis, right greater than left.
Though non-diagnostic for evaluation of acute pulmonary embolus
due to poor contrast delivery, there is heterogeneity within the
right pulmonary artery, which may correspond to the known
pulmonary embolus. However, correlation with prior (i.e. outside
studies), is advised. Alternatively, V/Q scan or repeat CT could
be performed if clinically indicated.

EEG Study Date of [**2154-1-29**]
IMPRESSION: This is a normal routine EEG obtained predominantly
in
drowsiness. No lateralizing abnormalities were seen. During the
recording notation was made of twitching without electrographic
evidence
of seizure activity.

[**2154-1-30**] 9:21 AM CT HEAD W&W/O IV CONTRAST: No intraparenchymal
or subarachnoid hemorrhage is seen. No major vascular
territorial infarct is identified. Ventricles are not dilated,
and there is no shift of normally midline structures. There are
no abnormal areas of contrast enhancement within the brain
parenchyma. The density of the brain parenchyma is within normal
limits. The osseous structures are normal. Mucosal thickening is
noted in the left frontal air cell, the sphenoid air cells, and
the maxillary sinuses bilaterally.

CT C-SPINE W/CONTRAST  [**2154-2-1**] 9:50 AM
Contrast-enhanced CT images were obtained from the skull base
through the thoracic inlet. The field of view is large to
evaluate the soft tissues of the neck. There are no previous
studies for comparison.
Due to the patient's body habitus, there is marked streak
artifact across the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine
images. The spinal canal is fairly well-visualized from the
skull base through C4, and there does not appear to be stenosis
or neural impingement at these levels. Inferior to this,
although bony anatomy is defined, the intraspinal structures are
obscured.
Sagittal and coronal reformatted images demonstrate normal
vertebral alignment. No fractures are identified. There are no
asymmetries or abnormally-enhancing structures in the cervical
paraspinal region examined. There is no destructive change of
the bones to suggest the presence of an osteomyelitis.
A tracheostomy is in place and the pharyngeal soft tissues
appear collapsed. The adenoids are enlarged. There is some fluid
and mucosal thickening within the paranasal sinuses.


Brief Hospital Course:
24 yo M with OSA p/w with hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory
failure, found to have bilateral PEs, transferred for difficulty
in vent management.

1) Respiratory failure - Multifactorial. Mostly hypoxic in
origin. Pt was requiring high FiO2 and PEEP to maintain
oxygenation. On admission, mild CHF w/o consolidations on CXR.
Likely hypoxia secondary to bilateral pulmonary emboli,
developed ventilator associated pneumonia (klebsiella); further
complicated by obesity/hypoventilation.  TTE documented small
R-->L shunt; hypoxic w/ positional changes.  As ventilation
course appeared to be prolonged, patient had tracheostomy placed
on [**2154-1-15**].  However, patient's respiratory status and
ventilation requirements continued to improve, and patient was
placed on trach mask trial [**2154-1-25**].  Patient was completely
weaned from mechanical ventilation by the next day, and
maintained O2 saturations above 94% for the remainder of
hospitalization on 12L FiO2 40% trach mask and spontaneous
breathing.

2) Metabolic acidosis: Patient was initially tx w/ bicarb
infusion, but required 3 days of CVVHD, which was initiated
[**1-4**].  CVVHD was discontinued as urine output improved and
acidosis resolved.

3) Fever -
   a) Ventilator Associated Pneumonia: Initially felt to be
secondary to pulmonary emboli and UTI at outside hospital.
However, patient continued to be febrile despite broad spectrum
coverage including aztreonam/linezolid/metronidazole/Zosyn.
Patient's cultures did speciate to klebsiella, and therapy was
tailored to mero
