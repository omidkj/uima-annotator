History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 84 year old female transferred from [**Hospital1 112**] on the
day of admission after presenting to their ED with vomiting and
poor po intake for 2 days. She also complained abdominal pain
with associated diarrhea. Per patient and family, she had been
vomiting for 2 day, which was clear, nonbloody and occasionally
resemble what she ait. She thinks this is [**3-4**] cabbage ingestion.
The day of admission, she had [**2-1**] bowel of cereal and toast,
which she immedicately vomited. She confirms hunger. Also with
loose stool for two days, but only one BM daily. No BRBPR, no
melena. She's felt warm, but states this is baseline and has not
taken her temperature. Did have a insect bite 2 days ago, that
developed a pustule that has since resolved. Has had cough for
several weeks, minimally productive. Son confirms intermittent
aspiration of fluids. No family members with illness, no renct
travel, unclean water sources or eating raw meat. No recent
antibiotics. Generally has one BM daily. No history of bowel
obstruction though is s/p appy and ccy. No pain currently.
Family states FS usually run 120-170, but were 300 this morning.

.
She was given 500cc NS and IV zofran. UA was reportedly negative
though not in the BICS system on sign-out. Did have mild cough
that was not productive.
.
Review of systems is positive for recent nausea, cough that
started approx 2 week ago. Additionally she has had orthopnea
and constipation at baseline. Her cough is mild and without
phlegm. She has vomited a few times in the last few days.
Negative for dizziness, syncope, presyncope, disorientation,
hematuria, fever, chills, dysuria, sorethroat or palpitations.
Reporst SOB that is improved with SL NTG at home.

EKG obtainted with SR, HR 90, mild LAD, LVH, old TWI AVL/I, STE
V1-V4, and STD V5-V6. Similar to prior but more exagerated since
[**2113-5-16**].
.
TTE (Complete) Done [**2113-5-17**] at 3:08:38 PM FINAL
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There
is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are thickened and
mild AS is suggested (difficult to assess due to low cardiac
output). No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
************
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2111-4-20**],
the overall LVEF appears lower. The severity of valvular
regurgitation has increased.


Brief Hospital Course:
#. Sepsis/Shock: Patient was initially admitted to the floor
with nausea/vomiting initially thought [**3-4**] viral gatroenteritis
given acute onset and associated fever, mild abdominal cramping.
However, patient became hypoxic and hypotensive with a lactate
of 8 that increased over her stay and met severe sepsis criteria
on basis of elevated WBCs, tachypnea, and HR >90 with suspected
infection in abdomen. A CT abd/pelvis revealed thrombus in her
aorta, renal infarcts, and bowel inflammation consistent with
ischemia. Over her MICU course her labs indicated both shock
liver and increasing ischemic bowel. She was bolused with NS
(several liters) and unasyn/flagyl for antibiotic coverage of
bowel flora. However, the lactate increased and her blood
pressure decreased indicating progression of her shock. Surgery
was consulted but felt the patient would not survive an
operation on the bowel. Over the next two days the patient
became increasingly hypotensive despite fluid boluses. A
discussion with the family indicated that they would not like to
pursue aggressive measures. The patient was kept comfortable
with IV morphine and passed away at 1:10pm on [**2113-9-21**].
.
# Transaminitis:  Likely from shock liver. No sign of a gross
infarct on CT, but small infarct could be contributing.
Cholangitis also a concern, although Alk P not very high so less
likely. Of note, patient with previous CCY. Treated with fluid
resuscitation.
.
# ARF:  Liklely from renal infarction. Shock/dehydration could
have also contributed. UA negative.
.
# Metabolic acidosis: Likely due to lactic acidosis in the
setting of showering clots causing infarction, and hypotension.
Renal failure could also be contributing. Treated with fluid
resuscitation.
.
# Coagulopathy: PT and INR became elevated, in addition to
elevated PTT expect given heparin tx. Thought to likely
represent DIC. Could also be affected by the high dose heparin.
FFP was considered but never needed.
.
#. SOB: Patient with acute SOB on arrival to medical floor. ECG
was unremarkable, cardiology consulted, cardiac enzymes cycled.
SOB was likely from fluid boluses. Improved transiently until
became acutely tachypnic and tachycardic with evolving shock.
Was treated with IV morphine PRN to keep patient comfortable.
.
# Pump: EF 15-20% on last Echo in 4/[**2113**].  Thought that shock
was likely being exacerbated by low EF and low cardiac output,
monitored oxygenation with fluid resuscitation however patient
never became hypoxemic and did not require lasix.
.
# Rhythm: Sinus rhythm on admission. Electrolytes were
monitored.
.
# Diabetes: Patient with elevated glucose on arrival, no ketones
in urine. Insulin gtt for [**Year (4 digits) **] glucose < 150 continued for
duration of stay.
.
# Hypertension:  Antihypertensive were held given shock.
