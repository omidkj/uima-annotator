Pertinent Results:
BONE MARROW BIOPSY AND FLOW CYTOMETRY ([**2198-10-7**]): AML:
Immunophenotypic findings consistent with acute myelogenous
leukemia, with an immature phenotype.

RVG ([**2198-10-8**]): Following the intravenous injection of
autologous red blood cells labeled with  Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, first pass and
equilibrium images were obtained. The first pass study  shows
prompt tracer flow through the central circulation.  IMPRESSION:
1) Normal LV wall motion. 2) Normal right and left ventricular
sizes. 3) LVEF of 55%.

CXR ([**2198-10-8**]): FINDINGS: There is a left subclavian central
venous catheter with the tip in satisfactory location in the
distal SVC. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiac and
mediastinal contours are unremarkable. The pulmonary vascularity
is normal, and the lungs are clear. No pleural effusions are
seen on this film, although the left costophrenic sulcus is not
visualized. The osseous structures and soft tissues are
unremarkable to the extent visualized.

CT TORSO ([**2198-10-17**]): IMPRESSION: 1. No infectious source
detected. 2. Single 6-mm left upper lobe nodule. 3.
Fat-containing right inguinal hernia.

RUQ U/S ([**2198-10-22**]): IMPRESSION: Normal right upper quadrant
ultrasound examination.

BONE MARROW BIOPSY AND FLOW CYTOMETRY ([**2198-10-23**]): DIAGNOSIS:
Persistent involvement by acute myelogenous leukemia.

CT ABD ([**2198-10-26**]): IMPRESSION - 1. Limited study of the abdomen
secondary to significant patient debility as described above.
There is no intrahepatic ductal dilatation. 2. Extensive patchy
airspace opacities throughout both lungs, which given the
patient's neutropenic state could represent a diffuse widespread
pneumonia, as well as alveolar hemorrhage.

ECHO ([**2198-10-26**]): 1.The LA is mildly dilated. 2.There is mild
symmetric LV hypertrophy. The LV cavity size is normal. There is
severe global LV  hypokinesis. Overall LV systolic function is
severely depressed with more marked anterior and inferior HK.
3.The aortic root is mildly dilated. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. 4.The AV leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion. Trace AI is seen. 5.The MV leaflets
are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) MR is seen. 6.There is mild
pHTN. 7. There is no pericardial effusion. 8. Normal RV size and
function.

RUQ U/S ([**2198-10-28**]): IMPRESSION: No evidence of cholecystitis or
dilation of intrahepatic bile ducts.

CT CHEST ([**2198-10-31**]): IMPRESSION: 1. Interval development of
diffuse pulmonary opacities throughout both lungs in a central
distribution. This may represent pulmonary edema or a diffuse
infection. Infectious etiologies include PCP or CMV. Some areas
are nodular, which may represent a superimposed fungal infection
such as aspergillus. 2. Small bilateral pleural effusions.

ECHO ([**2198-11-6**]): The LA is mildly dilated. LV wall thicknesses
are normal. The LV cavity is moderately dilated with severe
global HK. No masses or thrombi are seen in the LV. The RV
cavity is mildly dilated with moderate free wall HK. The aortic
root is mildly dilated. The AV leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. Mild (1+) AI is seen. The MV
appears structurally normal with trivial MR. There is no MV
prolapse. Mild (1+) MR is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be estimated. There is no pericardial
effusion. Compared with the report of the prior study (tape
reviewed) of [**2198-10-26**], the LV cavity is now dilated (previous
[**Last Name (un) **] 6.0cm). The RV cavity and systolic function are similar.

CXR ([**2198-11-24**]): PORTABLE AP CHEST, ONE VIEW: Comparison
[**2198-10-31**]. Since the prior study, the left subclavian line has
been removed. There are diffuse multifocal alveolar opacities.
Differential includes multifocal pneumonia as well as asymmetric
edema. There are no large pleural effusions (left lateral CP
angle not included). The heart is upper normal in size. Overall
appearances are slightly improved from [**2198-10-31**].

ECHO ([**2198-11-26**]): The LA is mildly dilated. The RA is moderately
dilated. LV wall thicknesses are normal. The LV cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall LV systolic function is severely
depressed. The RV cavity is mildly dilated. There is severe
global RV free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly
dilated. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic
arch is mildly dilated. The AV leaflets are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) AR is seen. The MV leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild
(1+) MR is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Compared with
the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2198-11-6**], biventricular
systolic function now appears slightly worse.

BONE MARROW BIOPSY ([**2198-11-27**]): DIAGNOSIS - Markedly hypocellular
bone marrow for age, with left-shifted granulocytic maturation
and markedly decreased erythropoiesis. Acute leukemia is not
seen.

RUQ U/S ([**2198-11-28**]): FINDINGS: Sludge is no longer seen in the
gallbladder. The gallbladder appears normal without evidence of
stones. There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal
dilatation. The liver parenchyma appears unremarkable.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 5655**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] BMT service with acute
myelogenous leukemia (AML). He subsequently developed severe
congestive heart failure after anthracycline chemotherapy.

1) AML: The patient had a white blood cell count of 40,000 to
60,000 on admission. He was started on hydroxyurea for temporary
stabilizing measures. A bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry
revealed acute myelogenous leukemia, with an immature phenotype.
The patient was started on [7+3] chemotherapy with cytarabine
and idarubacin. As anticipated, his cell lines dropped and the
patient soon became neutropenic. He thus had neutropenic fevers
early in his course (without any obvious source of infection).
Empiric antimicrobials and then antifungals were commenced (see
below). Approximately two weeks after his [7+3] regimen, a bone
marrow biopsy revealed persistent involvement by AML.
Re-induction chemotherapy was planned, but the patient developed
an acute decline in his repiratory status: pulmonary nodules and
then congestive heart fail
