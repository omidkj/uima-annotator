Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2279**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 805**] is a 60 year old female with a history of
neurofibromatosis, COPD on 2L home O2, systolic HF 40-45%, PE,
adrenal insufficiency due to chronic steroids, who was
transferred to the MICU from the ED for management of dyspnea
and evaluation of high lactate. Of note she has been admitted 20
times just in the past year. This am she reports chest
heaviness/pressure, no radiation. Also with SOB and difficulty
expiring air. She took some nebs this morning with only a
"teeny" amount of response, and notes she usually takes nebs at
9a, noon, 3p, 6p, 9p. She thinks the exacerbating factor was a
hot shower this morning.
.
Initial vitals in the ED were T 97.7 HR 80 BP 126/72 RR 24 Sat
100% 4L Nasal Cannula. She had a leukocytosis to 13.2 with 92%
neutrophils. Her lactate trended from 3.2 to 4.0 while in the
ED, but was down to 2.8 by tranfer. Antibiotics received in the
ED includes azithromycin 250mg po once and levofloxacin 750mg iv
once. Narcotics administered in the ED included oxycodone 5mg po
once and morphine 4mg iv twice. She also recieved aspirin 325mg,
several nebulizer treatments, and solumedrol 125mg iv (of note
she is in the middle of a steroid taper, was down to 5mg daily).
EKG: TWI in 1, AVL, unchanged from previous. The morphine was
administered for chest pain that occurred at some point in the
ED, first set of troponins were negative and EKG was
unremarkable.
.
Due to difficult stick and elevated lactate, a RIJ CVL was
placed. Her lactate was then noted to go from 4.0 to 2.8 just
before admission to MICU.
.
She had a recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**2172-4-15**] to [**2172-4-17**] for
evaluation of chest pain and presyncope, which were thought to
be non-cardiac in origin -- COPD vs musculoskeletal. She was
treated for a COPD exacerbation with a steroid taper. She had
been taking prednisone 5mg daily currently. She was also treated
for c-diff, which was confirmed by pcr in a prior admission, and
she completed a course of PO Vancomycin.

CXR [**2172-4-30**]:
Suspect underlying emphysema. No acute pulmonary process
identified within
limitations.

CXR [**2172-5-1**]:
In comparison with study of [**4-30**], there has been placement of a
right IJ catheter that extends to the mid-to-lower portion of
the SVC. No
evidence of pneumothorax. Bibasilar areas of opacification could
reflect
merely atelectasis and small effusions. In the appropriate
clinical setting, however, the possibility of supervening
pneumonia would have to be considered.

CXR [**2172-5-1**]:
In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the
questioned opacification at the right base is less prominent and
may merely
represented fortuitous overlap of normal pulmonary vessels.

LENI [**2172-5-1**]:
1. No evidence of deep venous thrombosis involving the left
lower extremity.
2. Slightly dampened respiratory variation within the left
venous system,
however, this is likely due to compression from the patient's
pannus which was asymmetrically positioned overlying the left
groin.

Brief Hospital Course:
60 year-old female with a history of COPD on 2L home O2 (with
multiple recent admissions for COPD exacerbation),
neurofibromatosis, systolic HF with EF 40-45%, PE, history of
adrenal insufficiency due to chronic steroids, initially
transferred to the MICU for management of dyspnea and elevated
serum lactate, transferred to floor without intubation and O2
sat 96-98% prior to discharge with normalized lactate.

#) COPD exacerbation: Patient presented from home [**2172-4-29**] with
dyspnea with O2 sat 100% on 4L and tight, non-radiating chest
pain. Her last outpatient PFTs on [**2172-4-27**] with FEV1/FVC of 66%
and FEV1 of 41% predicted with DLCO 27%, indicating moderate to
severe disease. She was continued on oxygen via nas
