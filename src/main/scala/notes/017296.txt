HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 106001**] is a 68-year-old
African-American male with a history of coronary artery
disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular accident,
peripheral vascular disease, and Parkinson disease who was
admitted with abdominal pain.

The patient apparently complained of one day of diffuse
abdominal pain and tightness upon presentation to the
Emergency Room.  He denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
constipation, and fever.  In the Emergency Room, the patient
had an abdominal CAT scan which showed thrombosis of the left
renal artery and necrosis of a large portion of his left
kidney.  There was also a filling defect in the superior
mesenteric artery and concern for mesenteric ischemia.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   Review of systems on admission was
negative for chest pain, shortness of breath, sputum
production, night sweats, cough, visual changes, dysuria,
headache, neck stiffness, and new motor symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Parkinson disease.
2.  Status post cerebrovascular accident with resulting
right-sided weakness, dysphagia, and left arm and leg
clumsiness.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Peripheral vascular disease.
5.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2114**].
6.  Congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction
of 25%.
7.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
8.  Pulmonary hypertension.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  (The patient's medications on
admission were as follows)
 1.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
 2.  Atenolol 150 mg p.o. q.d.
 3.  Lipitor 40 mg p.o. q.d.
 4.  Ibuprofen p.o. p.r.n.
 5.  Imdur.
 6.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
 7.  Univasc.
 8.  Aggrenox.
 9.  NPH insulin 28 units q.a.m. and 14 units q.h.s.
10.  Regular insulin 4 units q.a.m. and 6 units q.h.s.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a positive smoking history
of three packs per day for approximately 35 years.  He lives
alone with family nearby and is retired.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
at the time of presentation revealed the patient had a
temperature of 97.2, a blood pressure of 219/122, a heart
rate of 80, a respiratory rate of 18, and an oxygen
saturation of 95% on an unknown amount of oxygen.  He was a
pleasant gentleman in no apparent distress.  Alert and
oriented to person, place, and time.  Head and neck
examination showed pupils were equal, round, and reactive to
light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements were intact.
The oropharynx was clear.  His neck showed a jugular venous
pressure of less than 10.  His lungs had crackles at the
bases.  Heart was regular in rate and rhythm with a positive
fourth heart sound.  The abdomen was mildly firm, diffusely
tenderness to palpation, positive bowel sounds.  Back
revealed there was no costovertebral angle tenderness.
Extremities revealed no edema. Neurologic examination
revealed cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  The
patient's strength was [**3-21**] in the upper and lower
extremities, and his reflexes were 2+ bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories at
the time of admission revealed the patient had a white blood
cell count of 6.6, a hematocrit of 51.2, and platelets
of 224.  His differential showed 48 polys and 43 lymphocytes.
Chem-7 showed a sodium of 140, potassium of 3.8, chloride
of 103, bicarbonate of 20, blood urea nitrogen of 17,
creatinine of 1.4.  The patient had an arterial blood gas in
the Emergency Room which was 7.39/30/36 with a lactate
of 6.6.  The patient had a PT of 14.8, a PTT of 30.7, and an
INR of 1.5.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed a leftward axis
with intraventricular conduction delay, left atrial
enlargement, and a left bundloid appearance, left ventricular
hypertrophy; there were no significant changes as compared
with old study.

On abdominal CT, there was occlusion of the left renal artery
with necrosis of the left kidney which appeared swollen and
acute.  There was a filling defect in the superior mesenteric
artery which refilled distally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit and heparinized for his left artery and
probable superior mesenteric artery clot.  He remained
hemodynamically stable the first night, and his lactate had
decreased from 6.6 to 5 by the morning on hospital day two.

However, on hospital day two his white blood cell count
increased from 6 to 20 with a high number of bands.  His
creatinine increased from 1.4 to 2.2, and his abdominal pain
worsened significantly.

The patient was evaluated by Urology, Vascular Surgery, and
General Surgery who all felt that the patient needed an
emergent abdominal angiogram to assess the extent of his
superior mesenteric artery clot and mesenteric ischemia.

This angiogram was performed on hospital day two and showed
severe atherosclerotic disease throughout the aorta, iliac,
and femoral vessels.  The celiac and splenic arteries were
patent.  There was a clot in the midportion of the superior
mesenteric artery with filling of some small peripheral
vessels.  T-PA and papaverine were instilled into the
superior mesenteric artery with some clearance of clot and
vasodilation.  The left renal artery was completely
obstructed.

Based on these findings, surgery was offered to the patient
and family by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] of General Surgery.  After hearing
Dr.[**Name (NI) 1745**] description of the extensive surgery and multiple
ostomies that would likely be necessary to remove necrotic
bowel, the patient and his family refused surgical
intervention.

The patient remained hemodynamically stable overnight on
hospital day two and throughout the day on hospital day
three.  He underwent a magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic
resonance angiography of the head on hospital day three for
evaluation of a new left third nerve palsy since
presentation.

On this magnetic resonance imaging, the patient was noted to
have an incidental finding of a aneurysm in the trifurcation
of the middle cerebral artery.  Given that the patient's
likelihood of survival without surgery for his mesenteric
ischemia was quite low, no intervention was undertaken for
this aneurysm.

Late on hospital day three, the patient began to have
progressive hypoxia and hypotension with blood pressures in
the 70s/40s.  As the patient and his family had decided to
forego surgery, and in doing so fully understood that this
would mean the patient's likely death, no intervention was
undertaken.

The patient was made do not resuscitate/do not intubate by
his family after discussion with physicians.  However, on
hospital day four, the family decided that they would like
medical treatment for his hypotension.  The patient was
started on a Levophed drip.

On the morning on hospital day five, the patient's
respiratory status declined precipitously with saturations in
the middle 80s on 100% nonrebreather.  The patient began to
have runs of significant tachycardia to the 190s and runs of
ventricular tachycardia lasting 20 to 30 beats.  Given the
futility of pressors for treatment of mesenteric ischemia
without surgical intervention, and the patient's worsening
arrhythmias, the Levophed was stopped on the morning on
hospital day five.

The patient's pressure slowly declined, although he remained
comfortable on a morphine drip and he eventually died on
[**2117-4-16**] at 10:30 a.m.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Mesenteric ischemia.
2.  Left renal artery stenosis and left kidney necrosis.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Left third nerve palsy.
