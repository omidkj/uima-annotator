Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bipap Ventilation

History of Present Illness:
81 yo F with a past medical history of recurrent pna, concerns
for aspiration and bronchiectasis presents with productive
cough, fever and hypoxia from rehab facility. She was recently
on levaquin for presumed CAP which stopped on [**4-10**]. She is
unsure how long cough has been going on for.
.
Of note, patient was admitted in [**2-2**] through [**2-8**] for presumed
COPD exacerbation. Bronchoscopy in the MICU showed evidence of
possible aspiration, but cultures were negative for antibiotics
were stopped on [**2-6**]. Patient has been made aware of her
aspiration risk on many previous hospital stays, and this was
reaffirmed during this stay but patient still prefers po intake.
During this hospital stay she had AF with RVR and associated
hypotension that resolved with diltiazem x 5 mg.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T:98.7 HR:75 BP:103/66 RR:24
O2Sat:89 on NC. Mild dementia so not the most reliable
historian. D Dimer was negative and no CTA was done. CXR showed
just hyperinflation without focal infiltrate and significant
improvement from prior. EKG showed no changes. As she waited in
ED she had acute drop in sats to high 80s and was put on a NRB
and ABG:7.42/38/60/25. Now on bipap and now 100%. She received
1L NS, solumedrol, azithro, duonebs for presumed COPD
exacerbation. ABG post bipap 7.38/44/160/27. She was transiently
off Bipap after that, and sats dropped to 88%, so she was placed
back on Bipap.
.
In the ICU, patient reported breathing feels better than when
she arrived to the hospital.  She was started on Vanc/Cefepime
for health care acquired pneumonia, PICC later placed. She
continued to desaturate when sitting, requiring intermittent
BiPap. ECHO was performed showing severe pulmonary hypertension
with cor pulmonale and a PFO. In discussions with the patient
and family, agreed to PEG tube. GI was contact[**Name (NI) **] for planned
placement on [**Name (NI) 766**], [**4-26**]. CTA chest showed impacted LLL
bronchi with partially collapsed LLL so patient was started on
Coughilator three times daily and facemask 40% with good effect;
repeat CXRs showed reinflation of LLL. NGT was placed and
patient was started on tube feeds given chronic aspiration. She
was felt stable to be called out to the floor.
.

Images: PFTs [**3-10**]:
Spirometry is within normal limits. Compared to the prior study
of [**2116-9-22**] the FVC has increased by 1.64 L (+92%) and the FEV1
has increased by 1.50 L (+144%).
.
CXR ([**2117-4-23**]): A nasogastric tube is seen with side port in the
stomach and tip beyond the film. Other mechanical and support
lines are unchanged in position and course. There is no
pneumothorax. The lungs are again hyperinflated, with bibasilar
pleural scarring. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
normal.
.
CTA ([**2117-4-21**]): 1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic
pathology.
2. Fluid-filled lower lobe bronchi, compatible with recent
spiration.
Partial LLL collapse. Mild right basilar atelectasis. Bilateral
lower lobe tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] appearance, suggestive of multifocal
pneumonia.
3. Diffusely dilated esophagus with air-fluid level, increasing
the patient's risk of aspiration.
.
ECHO: Small ASD (patent foramen ovale) is present. There is
severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with cor
pulmonale.
IMPRESSION: Patent foramen ovale with transient right-to-left
shunting.
.
EKG: NSR, 66 bpm, nl axis, nl intervals

Brief Hospital Course:
81yo F with h/o recurrent aspiration PNAs admitted with fever,
cough, hypoxia.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure: Unclear patient's baseline PO2
with range 68-130 in our system but Dr.[**Name (NI) 1985**] note from pulm
clinic notes her O2 sat to be 96% on RA in [**Month (only) 956**]. Oxygenation
improved on NRB and then Coughilator (MIE) three times daily
with Facemask 40% given partial LLL collapse. Negative D Dimer
upon admission to MICU made PE unlikely. Recurrent aspiration
seemed a likely contributing factor given Speech and Swallow
evaluation as well. Patient was continued on Coughilator (MIE)
three times daily and Facemask 40%. Her oxygen was weaned as
tolerated. The patient was also continued on Vanc/Cefepime for
planned 14 day course (Vanc day 1: [**4-17**], Cefepime day 1: [**4-20**])
after a five day course of Levofloxacin. Sputum cultures were
mixed flora. Patient was empirically treated with a steroid
taper (initially IV methylprednisolone that was transitioned to
Prednisone 25mg daily which was tapered off. Patient developed a
leukocytosis fe
