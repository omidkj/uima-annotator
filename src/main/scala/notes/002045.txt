Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital1 **] for persistent fevers


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**8-12**] AVR (#21 Biocor)


History of Present Illness:
79 yo male with very complicated pmhx including critical AS s/p
valvuloplasty, IDDM, PAF, MRSA pneumonia and c-diff, recently
discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2129-7-1**] after being admitted for
hypotension, and fevers, thought to be secondary to pseudomnal
pneumonia.  The patient was initially on broad spectrum
antibiotics, which were eventually narrowed to Ciprofloxacin
once sensitivities were obtained.  The patient was discharged to
[**Hospital3 **] for further treatment and rehab.  He completed
his course of Cipro on [**2129-7-4**], but then spiked on [**2129-7-5**].
Vancomycin and Ceftaz were started, cultures were sent.  Sputum
culture returned with evidence of pseudomonas, resistant to
Ciprofloxacin, and MRSA.  The patient also had an episode of
a-fib with RVR which responded well to oral diltiazem.  Given
that the patient has had intermittent fevers since admission to
[**Hospital1 **] and has poor progress in weaning from the ventilator,
the patient's family requested transfer back to [**Hospital1 18**] ICU.  In
addition, the family notes great concern over the patients
increasing lethargy.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient denies pain or difficulty
breathing, able to follow minimal commands.  On speaking with
the daughter, she states that her father had the recurrent fever
a few days ago, seemed improved after the antibiotics were
restarted, but then appeared more lethargic yesterday.  She
states that at his baseline his is alert, aware of his
surroundings, able to move his L arm, wiggle his toes, and move
his ankles.

Pertinent Results:
Labs from rehab:
sputum [**7-5**]:
pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime, ceftaz, gent, imipenem,
zosyn
sputum [**7-1**]:
pseudomonas and MRSA- MRSA sensitive to Bactrim
urine culture [**7-5**]: no growth
blood culture [**7-5**]: 1/4 bottles CNS
ABG [**7-9**]: 7.49/51/89/39
INR- 1.4
CBC [**7-8**]:
.
prior studies-
Echo [**2129-6-27**]:
IMPRESSION: Moderate aortic valve stenosis. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity sizes and
regional/global biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral
regurgitation.
.
EEG [**7-5**]:
IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the generalized bursts
of
slowing, including very sharp features and sharp waves in the
central
regions bilaterally. These finding suggest a midline disturbance
but
are not specific with regard to etiology. The sharp features are

evidence of cortical hypersynchrony and could be related to an
epileptic process but also to a metabolic disturbance. There
were no prominent focal areas of slowing. The background reached
acceptable frequencies but was disorganized, raising the
possibility of an encephalopathy, as suggested by the clinical
report.
.
MR HEAD [**6-4**]:
1.  No evidence of an acute infarction.
2.  Small chronic lacunar infarction in the body of the right
caudate nucleus.
3.  Mucosal thickening and air/fluid level of the right
maxillary sinus
consistent with acute sinusitis.
4.  No arterial occlusion or evidence of stenosis in the circle
of [**Location (un) 431**].
5.  Possible fenestration of the proximal basilar artery.
