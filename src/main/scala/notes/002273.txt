Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 7264**] is a 51-year-old male with past medical history
significant for type I diabetes and mental retardation who was
brought to ED from his group home after an episode of
hypoglycemia with FSG of 37 and repeat FSG of 40 even after
having his dinner. EMS was called and he was given [**12-16**] amp of
dextrose enroute to [**Hospital1 18**]. Per caregivers, patient's mental
status was at usual baseline. In the ED, initial vs were: T [**Age over 90 **]F,
P 86, BP 104/63, RR 20, O2 saturation rate is 97% room air.
Glucose trend in ED included  0030: fs=[**Telephone/Fax (1) 7265**]: fs=[**Telephone/Fax (1) 7266**]:
fs=173.

He also had a fever to 103F, noted cough on exam and tachypnea
to mid 30s range. No ABG was done in ED. CXR revealed
infiltrates in LLL and CTA also showed bilateral lower lobe
predominant opacities with more confluent consolidation in the
LLL. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
He was given 1L NS IVFs, 1g IV Ceftriaxone, 500mg IV
Azithromycin, and 1g Vancomycin for broad coverage for PNA.
.
On arrival to the ICU he appeared to be in no apparent distress
and was able to answer select yes/no questions but communication
was limited so most of history collected from his group home
care giver. Patient appeared very pale and had very dry mucous
membranes and dry tongue that were quite noticeable.


Past Medical History:
-mental retardation; lives in group home
-Type I diabetes ;  HgbA1c 8.7 on [**2131-2-15**]

Vitals: T 99.7F, HR 111, BP 128/62, RR 21, O2 saturation 98% on
3L NC
General: alert, no acute distress
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, dry MM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, JVP at 5-6cm, no LAD, no thyromegaly
Lungs: Bibasilar crackles, no wheezes, rhonchi
CVS: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops.
Abdomen:  soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
GU: no foley in place
NEURO: CNs [**1-26**] in tact, EOMI, sensation to light touch in tact,
toes downgoing, rest of exam limited
SKIN: pale complexion, no bruising, no rashes or lesions
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ peripheral pulses x 4 extremities
and  no cyanosis or edema

Pertinent Results:
Initial studies:
Micro:
-Blood Cultures x2 pending
-UA negative
.
CXR: lower lobe opacities noted on left side
.
CTA:Techincally limited study, with suboptimal opacification of
segmental and subsegmental vessels. No central or large
segmental PE. Bilateral lower lobe predominant
peribronchovascular opacity with more confluent consolidation in
the LLL, suggestive of bronchopneumonia. Hilar and mediastinal
adenopathy is likely reactive. Aberrant right subclavian artery
.
EKG: sinus tachycardia at 116, no ST elevations/depressions

Brief Hospital Course:
Middle aged Male with history of MR, brittle DM I who presented
with hypoglycemia, multifocal PNA initially admitted to the ICU
for resp distress but transferred to the floor without need for
intubation.

## Multifocal PNA: Pt noted on CXR and Chest CT to have
multifocal PNA. He was initially admitted to the ICU given the
concern for possible intubation [**1-16**] tachypnea however his
breathing rate has subsequently improved. He was transferred
from the ICU to the floor on IV Vancomycin, Cefepime and
Azithromycin. Microbiology work up has consisted of blood
cultures, MRSA screen. Urine legionella was also negative. He
was transitioned to oral antibiotics of Azithromycin however he
was noted to develop a drug rash. It is unclear if it was due to
the Azithromycin versus Zofran, though I suspect it may be
Azithromycin given his history of abx allergies. He was
transitioned to Doxycycline Hyclate 100mg twice a day.

## Thrombocytopenia: Pt was noted to have some thrombocytopenia
during his hospitalization but did not require any platelet
transfusions. On review of OMR it appears he has a history of
thrombocytopenia down to the 60s-100s between [**2119**]-[**2126**].  His
platelet count was trended and noted to improve, transient plt
drop may have been due to Vancomycin, can continue outpatient
follow up.

## Hypoglycemia: Pt noted to be hypoglycemic prior to admission,
though subsequent CBGs showed no hypoglycemia. The hypoglycemia
was likely due to poor PO intake given his infectious state.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted and followed the patient in house, he was
discharged on Lantus 20units and Metformin 500mg.

## Mental Retardation/Agitation: He was continued on his home
regimen of Clonazepam.

## Hyperlipidemia: He was continued on Simvastatin 40mg qHS

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after you were noted to have a
low blood sugar level and a cough. Whilst you were in the
Emergency Room you appeared to have trouble breathing so you
were sent to the intensive care unit. After being observed
overnight with your breathing improving you were transferred to
the regular floor. Prior to your discharge you were noted to
have a rash to one of your medications. We think it was one of
the antibiotics (Azithromycin). Your antibiotics were changed,
after taking
