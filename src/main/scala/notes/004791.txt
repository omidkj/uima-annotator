CT abdomen/pelvis: [**2189-12-14**]
1.Extensive trauma to the chest includes multiple left-sided rib
fractures, small to moderate left pneumothorax, left lung
contusions and possible lacerations, and hemorrhagic left
pleural effusion with evidence of active extravasation.
2.Small foci of air surround the aorta and the subdiaphragmatic
region and
are suggestive of either free air tracking along the pleural
surface or injury to the duodenum or esophagus. Continued
followup is recommended.
3.Grade 3 left renal laceration. There is also evidence of a
clot in the
left renal collecting system. Continued followup is recommended.

4.Hypodense foci throughout the spleen representative of grade 1
or 2
injuries consistent with contusions. Continued followup is
recommended.
5. There is evidence of bowel wall thickening involving the
small bowel in
the left lower quadrant along with a small amount of
hemoperitoneum, which
raise suspicion for small bowel. Continued followup is
recommended.
6. Multiple fractures including left third, fourth, sixth,
seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs, left sacral
ala, left anterior acetabular wall, and left superior and
inferior pubic rami fractures.

CT Cspine: [**2189-12-14**]
No acute cervical spine fractures or abnormal alignment.
Comminuted transverse fracture of the right mandibular ramus,
with the superior segment medially angulated.

CT Head: [**2189-12-14**]
1. Laceration involving the left ear is noted. There is,
however, no evidence of large intracranial hemorrhage or shift
of the normally midline structures.
2. Hyperdense foci along the right tentorium are likely
representative of beam hardening artifact. However, continued
followup is recommended.

C-xray (CT to water seal) [**12-17**]:
There is a left apical pneumothorax which is unchanged,
remaining
1.6 cm in maximal span. There is stable left lower lobe
atelectasis. Left
chest tube is seen in place. There is no pleural effusion.

CT Max/facial: [**2189-12-14**]
1. Minimally-comminuted, transverse fracture at the right
mandibular ramus. The right mandibular condyle remains in the
glenoid fossa. Equivocal right temporal bone fractures at the
right TMJ articulation surface. Moderate adjacent soft tissue
hematoma/swelling around the mandibular rami fracture site.
2. Minimally-displaced, oblique mandibular symphyseal fracture.
3. Minimally displaced right temporal styloid process fracture.

L hand xray: [**2189-12-14**]
Essentially non-displaced fractures of the second and fourth
metacarpals.

L Shoulder: [**2189-12-15**]: No fracture


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated in the trauma bay status-post motor
vehicle accident with radiographic and physical exam identifying
the following injuries:
Rib fractures [**1-29**], left
Left pneumothorax, hemothorax
Grade IV renal lac
Grade I splenic lac
Left sacral, left acetabular, left superior pubic ramus, and
left inferior pubic ramus fractures
Transverse fracture at the right mandibular ramus
Right temporal styloid process fracture

Patient was transferred to TSICU in stable condition. The
remainder of his course is described below by system.

Neuro: Patient's pain was moderately controlled with dilaudid
PCA. Due to multiple rib fractures, an epidural was placed for
analgesia with good effect on HD2. This was removed on HD#4, and
the patient was transitioned to oral pain medications with good
effect.

CV: The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored.

Resp: A left sided chest tube was placed in the trauma bay with
return of sanginous fluid and resolution of his pneumothorax.
The chest tube was kept on suction until HD 4 when it was placed
to water seal after decreased output to 80cc in 24 hours.
Aggressive pulmonary toilet was enforced and he was started on
inhaled nebulizer treatments. A chest xray after placing the CT
to suction showed remaining stable pneumothorax. His oxygen
saturations remained stable and he remained without respiratory
compromise. However, on [**12-18**] he became febrile to 101.7 and a
chest xray was obtained that was consistent with pneumonia. He
was empirically started on a 10-day course of levaquin for this
at this time. His chest tube was removed in the interim, and the
patient has maintained excellent O2 saturations without oxygen
requirement.

GI: Initial CT raised concern for a hollow viscus injury,
however the patient's clinical exam was stable and without
concern. He had no abdominal tenderness or pain with stable
vital signs. His diet was advanced soon thereafter, and was
later placed on full liquids per OMFS after ORIF of his
mandibular fracture and closed reduction of his temporal styloid
process fracture. He tolerated this well. He was instructed to
follow-up in clinic the week after discharge.

GU: A foley was placed in the trauma bay with initial hematuria
which resolved gradually by [**2189-12-17**]. The foley was removed the
following day [**2189-12-18**], at which time he voided without
difficulty. As noted on CT, the patient had a grade 4 renal
laceration, which was evaluated by urology. Recommendations at
this time remain to continue with conservative management as the
patient's hematocrit and creatinine remained stable; however, he
was noted to have frank blood and clots in his foley catheter on
HD 6, and was consented for and underwent a left renal artery
embolization by Interventional Radiology with no complications.
His hematuria gradually settled to slightly-tinged urine, and a
3-way was placed by Urology for intermittent clots, which was
attributed to the recent embolization.  His foley catheter was
then placed on continuous bladder irrigation with moderate
resolution of his hematuria. Continuous bladder irrigation was
removed the day of discharge with moderate resolution of his
hematuria. The patient tolerated this well and was discharged to
rehabilitation with a 3-way foley catheter in place and
instructions on hand-irrigation to evacuate clot.

Heme: The patient was noted to have a small grade I splenic
laceration. Patient did not receive any transfusions in the ICU.
HSC was started on HD #3 upon transfer to the floor. His
hematocrit remained stable prior to discharge.

ID: Patient was given a 7 day course of cephalexin for a left
ear laceration that included cartilage. He was also started on a
10 day course of levofloxacin for pneumonia as noted above, and
was afebrile prior to discharge without complaints of fevers,
shortness of breath, or coug
