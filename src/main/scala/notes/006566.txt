History of Present Illness:
79 y/o male with a h/o with a recent PNA on IV vancomycin which
was stopped 2 days ago who developed SOB while transferring from
bed to chair at NH. Sats were in the 80s on RA. 95% on NRB.
Approximately 2 wks ago, pt developed worsening SOB and was
admitted to [**Location (un) 745**] and started on ABx for PNA along with
steroids as treatment for COPD exacerbation. He was then sent to
a NH for further administration of IV ABx. He developed some
numbness and tingling in his left thumb and was transferred back
to [**Location (un) 745**] for further evaluation. Orthopedics was consulted and
he was diagnosed with anterior interosseus palsy. He was then
discharged back to the NH and developed acute SOB and hypoxia on
the day of admission. He was sent to the [**Location (un) 620**] ED for further
evaluation. He was given steroids and ABx and was subsequently
found to have a PE and started on a heparin gtt. He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management of
PNA and PE.

RADS:
CT chest: VERY LIMITED STUDY DEMONSTRATING EVIDENCE FOR
PULMONARY EMBOLISM IN THE LEFT LUNG.  RIGHT LUNG INFILTRATES
CONSISTENT WITH PNEUMONIA.
SMALL PLEURAL EFFUSIONS.  COPD.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. Transferred to Floor from ICU, stable on transfer and only
one episode of desat following near aspiration of small food
particle. Minimal reserve. Seen by SS and cleared for regular
diet. Respiratory status consistently improved. HCT stable, no
further tachycardia, enzymes stable. no new issues from floor
stay.

#Pulmonary embolism: Per OSH records, CT with evidence of PE (L
lung) and RLL PNA which most likely explains worsening SOB/DOE.
Given ABx at OSH, started here on levo/vanc ([**3-9**]) for coverage
of CAP and HAP given recent hospital admission.  Continued
steroids to complete a quick taper for COPD exacerbation.
Started heparin gtt for PE and transition to coumadin. On
admission to floor ([**3-10**]), pt briefly desat'd to 80s on 4L after
aspirating small piece of food, improved quickly with O2 (NRB),
nebulized ipratropium, and coughing up food. Pt continued to be
afebrile, with CXR showing consolidation in same location as
previous PNA from 2wks ago (RUL), so because of decreased
suspicion of PNA, abx were discontinued.  When PTT was
therapeutic on heparin gtt, pt was switched to lovenox while
bridging to coumadin.
([**3-11**]) Pt seen by pulm, had ultrasound/Doppler of L UE, B LE,
showing no evidence of clot).  Also, per Pulm, no IVC filter
recommended (lymphedema near absolute contraindication to IVC
filter given risk of obstruction; no data to support IVC filter
in COPD or cardiomyopathy).
-cont lovenox, coumadin until therapeutic INR.
---restart compression boots
-continue COPD meds and use PRN nebs for symptomatic control,
levalbuterol as albuterol likely inductive of tachycardia.
-no evidence of volume overload on exam but pt has a h/o
diastolic dysfunction, low suspicion for CHF exacerbation.
-aspiration precautions, f/u speech/swallow consult (recurrent
aspiration)..
-[**3-12**] Pt. respiratory status improved. Per Pulm, will need
anticoagulation with length determined by PCP/outpt. care.
.
# Anemia: Hct in low 30s on admission, stable, no known h/o
anemia from prior.  Normocytic, likely mild ACD (slightly low
TIBC, transferrin; normal B12, folate).  Pt was Guaiac + on
admission with stable Hct, d/w GI who rec follow HCT, no scope
for now.  Pt currently asx, but continues to be guaiac positive
(rectal exam did not demonstrate any masses).
-follow Hct
-cont guaiac checking stools (still G+ [**3-11**]). d/w PCP who will
[**Name Initial (PRE) **]/u for outpt. colonoscopy when approrpriate as rec'd by GI.
.
# HTN
-monitor BP, consider increasing dose if BPs still elevated.
- will re-start home meds and monitor, d/w PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] switched to
Tiazac, Zestril, Lasix prior to discharge.
.
# BPH/increased urgency/frequency: Likely due to BPH, not likely
UTI given neg UA/UCx, but may be due to prostatitis or
incomplete bladder emptying or detrussor instability.  Prostate
exam demonstrated nontender, nonboggy prostate without nodules,
making prostatitis less likely.
-bladder scan this am to measure PVR (? urinary retention).
-continue Proscar and Flomax
-d/w urology who had no further recs, f/u urology for additional
exam and PSA as outpt.
-Bladder scan prior to discharge with residual of 62.

# Hypothyroidism
- home dose of Synthroid  while in house.

- cardiac diet
