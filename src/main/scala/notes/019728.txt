HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46 year old
female with a history of polysubstance abuse who was
transferred from [**Hospital 46148**] Hospital on [**2-17**] with
hypoxemic respiratory failure.  The patient has a complicated
recent medical history including an admission to [**Hospital 46148**]
Hospital in [**2176-11-8**] following an overdose with
multiple substances, subsequently developing bilateral
question aspiration pneumonias requiring an Intensive Care
Unit stay (it is not clear if the patient was intubated at
this time).  The patient developed persistent hypoxemia after
her [**Month (only) **] admission and was placed on 3 liters of nasal
cannula oxygen upon [**Month (only) **] in [**Month (only) 1096**].  In the interim
she had restarted using alcohol, intravenous heroin,
intranasal cocaine and abusing other pills including PCAs.
In this setting she presented to [**Hospital 46148**] Hospital on [**1-30**] with complaints of increasing shortness of breath.  She
had increased her use of intravenous heroin and intranasal
cocaine within the preceding week.  She was begun on
Ceftazidime and Clindamycin for possible aspiration pneumonia
and also given steroids and nebulizers for compliance of
reactive disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Her initial chest x-rays at the outside hospital revealed
diffuse bilateral infiltrates concerning for adult
respiratory distress syndrome versus bilateral pneumonias due
to severe aspiration.  The patient had increasing oxygen
requirement and was eventually placed on nonrebreather on the
medical floor.  By report, her echocardiogram revealed normal
left ventricular function.  Antibiotics were changed to
Levaquin on [**2-3**] and then to Azithromycin on [**2-6**].  The patient's respiratory status continued to decline
and she was intubated on [**2177-2-8**] at [**Hospital 46148**]
Hospital.  The patient underwent bronchial alveolar lavage on
[**2-10**].  She had a negative lenie on [**2-2**].

The patient continued to require increasing positive end
expiratory pressure and ventilatory supports by aggressive
antibiotic therapy and Intensive Care Unit management.  The
patient underwent a chest computerized tomography scan on
[**2-11**] which revealed diffuse bilateral interstitial lung
disease with subpleural bronchiectasis with a diffuse
reticular nodular pattern.  The patient underwent right open
wound biopsy on [**2177-2-13**] after which a right tube was
placed.  The patient continued to require high forced
inspiratory oxygen levels and positive end-expiratory
pressure.  The patient was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further evaluation
management of her bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, question
acute and chronic pulmonary disease of unclear etiology.  She
was transferred on [**2177-2-17**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Polysubstance abuse; 2.  Question
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 3.  Question untreated
obstructive sleep apnea; 4.  Obesity; 5.  Question bipolar
disorder versus depression with psychotic features; 6.
Question reactive airway disease.

ALLERGIES:  Codeine causes gastrointestinal upset.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Propofol drip; Versed drip; Lovenox
subcutaneous; morphine drip; Ciprofloxacin 400 intravenously
b.i.d.; Lopressor; Lansoprazole; Solu-Medrol 60 b.i.d.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive tobacco use, patient lives with
sister and has had a long history of polysubstance abuse
including intravenous heroin, intranasal cocaine, alcohol and
psychiatric medications.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission temperature 99,
heartrate 66, blood pressure 107/70, respiratory rate 18,
oxygen saturation 96%.

LABORATORY DATA:  Arterial blood gases, 7.41, pACO2 46, pAO2
72, on FIO2 of 65% with positive end-expiratory pressure of
15.  White count 17.3, hematocrit 37, platelets 272.  Chem-7
sodium 139, potassium 4, chloride 97, bicarbonate 28, BUN 16,
creatinine 0.3, glucose 117, normal coagulation studies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Fennard
Intensive Care Unit on [**2-17**] for further evaluation and
management of her diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrate and
persistent hypoxemia.  The patient's initial chest x-ray
revealed left lower lobe collapse and consolidation with
bibasilar ill-defined pulmonary infiltrate.  Given that the
patient had received greater than 14 days of broad-spectrum
antibiotics at the outside hospital the decision was made to
withhold any antibiotic treatment until sputum cultures were
revealing of an infectious etiology.  It is felt that the
patient was in the later stages of adult respiratory distress
syndrome.  Given that her open lung biopsy had revealed
diffuse alveolar damage, consistent with adult respiratory
distress syndrome and pulmonary edema, the patient was placed
on midury protocol for treatment of late stage adult
respiratory distress syndrome with tapering dose of
Solu-Medrol.  The patient continued, however, to have high
ventilatory support requirement with positive end-expiratory
pressure no less than 12.5 and FIO2 no less than 50%.  With
decreasing positive end-expiratory pressure and FIO2 the
patient immediately dropped oxygen saturation to the low 80s
with pAO2s in the 60s.  The patient continued to do well from
all other perspectives without complications of other organ
systems.  Her chest tube was removed on [**2177-2-19**]
without complications.  A PICC line was placed on [**2177-3-3**] for improved intravenous access, given poor
peripheral veins due to drug use.  Her right internal jugular
with triple lumen catheter was discontinued at this time.  A
repeat chest computerized tomography scan was obtained on
[**2177-3-4**] which revealed diffuse patchy areas of
groundglass opacification and consolidation.  There was
abnormal opacity of all areas of both lungs.  Consolidation
has a dependent distribution and no endobronchial lesions are
identified.  The computerized tomography scan was felt to be
consistent with diffuse alveolar damage/pulmonary edema in a
patient with adult respiratory distress syndrome.  The
possibility of acute interstitial pneumonitis, ([**Location (un) 2716**] [**Doctor First Name **]
syndrome) was suggested.  Radiologically, infectious etiology
can not be excluded.

Multiple discussions were held in an attempt to further
elucidate the etiology of the patient's persistent hypoxemia.
It appears that this hospitalization was precipitated by an
acute injury in the setting of chronic interstitial lung
disease.  Whether the patient has interstitial pulmonary
fibrosis is not clear.  It is clear that the patient has a
long history of chemical dependence and overdoses with ?
development of chemical pneumonitis and repeat chemical
versus infectious lung injury.  The patient had tracheostomy
placed on [**2177-3-3**] as it became clear that she would
require continuous ventilatory support in the rehabilitation
setting.  Placement of tracheostomy was without
complications.  The patient continued to do well after
tracheostomy placement and eventually had a percutaneous
enterogastric jejunostomy tube placed on [**2177-2-2**] for
nutritional support.  The procedure was without complications
and tube feeds were started through her gastrostomy tube
without complications.  The patient was seen by physical
therapy and did well.

At the time of [**Year (4 digits) **], the patient has ventilatory
settings of pressure support 15 with positive end-expiratory
pressure of 12.5, FIO2 40 to 50%.  In this setting her minute
ventilation was 10-12 liters per minute with a title volume
of 4 to 600.  Of note, the patient desaturates rapidly with
excessive coughing and agitation.  She has required
persistently increasing amount of Klonopin and Risperdal for
agitation.  It is clear that her substance abuse issues need
to be addressed as an outpatient as well as her anxiety
issues.

Of note, the patient had increasing secretions on [**3-6**]
with mildly increased temperatures and mild leukocytosis to
15,000.  Given clinical scenario of increasing secretion a
