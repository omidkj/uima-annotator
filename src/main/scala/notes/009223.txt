recent worsening of angina, experiencing chest discomfort
associated with diaphoresis and  lightheadedness after
vacuuming. Had EKG changes in ER and was taken for urgent cath

therefore referred for elective surgical revascularization.

Pertinent Results:
[**2205-10-8**] TEE PRE-BYPASS: 1. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler. 2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
of the anterior, anterolateral and apical segments. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45
%). 3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. 4. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. 5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**1-8**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.  6. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted and underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. For surgical details, please
see seperate dictated operative note. Intraoperative
echocardiogram was notable for systolic congestive heart failure
with an LVEF of 40%. Following the operation, he was brought to
the CVICU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without incident. He
maintained stable hemodynamics and transferred to the SDU on
postoperative day one. Chest tubes and pacing wires were removed
without complication. He remained in a normal sinus rhythm as
beta blockade was advanced as tolerated. Due to steady clinical
improvement with diuresis, he was medically cleared for
discharge to home on postoperative day three. At discharge, his
bp was 108/60 with a hr of 86. His room air saturations were
94%.
