ABDOMEN U.S. (COMPLETE STUDY) Study Date of [**2148-6-12**] 8:29 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Limited examination shows no gross intrahepatic biliary
dilatation.
2. Markedly edematous gallbladder, without stones or distension.
The
appearance of the wall can be seen in patients with underlying
liver disease
or hypoproteinemia.
3. Fluid within the left upper quadrant, of uncertain etiology
or location.
Differential considerations include a fluid-filled, distended
stomach, vs.
post- operative fluid within the splenectomy bed.
4. Small amount of ascites.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2148-6-14**] at 11:43:53 AM:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  >= 55%
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve,
but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to
suboptimal image quality. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen (suboptimal-quality study).
Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function. In
presence of high clinical suspicion, absence of vegetations on
transthoracic echocardiogram does not exclude endocarditis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old man with history of HIV,
splenectomy, presented with acute onset of fever, chills and
nausea. Patient was evaluated in the ED where he spiked fever to
102.5 and developed acute hypotension requiring rapid escalation
of care with 3 pressors and large volume resusitation for septic
shock.
.
Patient was in MICU from [**6-12**] where his course included Xigris
administration, CVVH for massive volume overload and treated
with broad spectrum antibiotics. Eventually the patient was
weaned off of pressors, received one dose of IVIG, and
subsequently placed on PCN G for strep viridans culture but had
one episode of hypotension and fever during which time 1 time
doses of vanc/zosyn were given. Today is day 18/28 as per ID of
PCN G course. In addition, the patient had unexplained
transaminitis during his stay, history of HBV infection and HBV
core antigen positive, negative HCV Ab. Transaminitis resolved
as patient was weaned from ventilation and pressures stabilized
-- on transfer AST/ALT have normalized and Alk Phos trending
down. Amylase and Lipase elevated on [**6-18**], continues to be
elevated -- there was an initial concern for pancreatitis and
abd. CT done showing mild pancreatitis; however lipase now
trending down and no signs of infection (fever, leukocytosis) is
present at transfer. Pt. also suffering from ARF likely ATN from
septic shock, received several rounds of CVVH after massive
fluid resuscitation, now auto-diuresing with up to 3L UOP/day,
though Cr still above 5 on transfer. In addition, pt. had a
transient drop in plt's to a nadir of 10 requiring plt
transfusion -- heme/onc consulted, reviewed smear, and believed
pathogenesis to be bone marrow suppression in light of
overwhelming sepsis, and not DIC. Plt levels have since returned
to normal.
.
On transfer to the floor, pt. was alert and talkative.  Was seen
by physical therapy and was able to transfer from bed to chair
and back with assistance.  Continued to have good urine output,
so renal concluded no need to place HD line.  Cr trended
downward to 3.1 the day prior to discharge, and patient was
tolerating adequate PO's.  Will be discharged on day 23 of 28 of
his PCN G as per ID.  In addition, was having diarrhea, C.diff
negative x 2.
.
Follow Up:
---------
- Please follow up MICROSPORIDIA STAIN, CYCLOSPORA STAIN, and
Cryptosporidium/Giardia DFA stool samples
- When Cr is under 1.5, please resume original HAART medications
