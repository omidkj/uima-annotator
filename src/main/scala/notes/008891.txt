Chief Complaint:
DOE

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (showing esophageal varices)


History of Present Illness:
76 yo M with CHF, CAD, AF on coumadin presented to OSH with DOE
x few days, chest pain a few days ago, diarrhea yesterday, today
became very weak. Pt c/o increasing edema R>L, +orthopnea,
denied bloody/black stools, but dark urine, feeling very weak
with standing, "near syncope" at home. At OSH appeared cyanotic,
o2 sats in 80s on RA.   1st CXR with cardiomegaly, early chf.
Per OSH notes, "exam worrisome for PE given large swollen leg,
but already anticoagulated with INR 3.2".  During ED eval,
became suddenly very hypoxic to 50s, bradycardic to 40s-50s.
Got atropine 1mg x 2. Intubated easily but never able to get
O2sats up above 90%, easy to vent.  ? PE, but already
anticoagulated and unable to get cta (creat 1.9). Received blood
for hct 27 and melena on exam (OGT negative for blood). ABG with
pO2 466 -- so o2sat not realiable. ETT advanced 2cm after post
tube CXR. Pt transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation and
management.
.
[**Hospital1 18**] ED COURSE: Initial VS T97.6 HR 70 BP 185/102, Placed on
propofol for sedation BP dropped to 93/42-->88/50, HR 65.
Propofol off, BP increased to 113/56, 1U PRBC and 2UFFP given,
unclear why Atropine 0.5mg x1 given. Also received Factor IX for
unclear reasons, no frank BRBPR or signs of sanguination. Pt
received Protonix 40mg x1, GI made aware, IVF bolus 500cc x1,
sent pt to MICU for further management and evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
AP: 76 yo M with HTN, hyperlipidemia, AF on coumadin, CHF EF
presents with hypoxia, pulm edema, ARF, GIB with
supratherapeutic INR.
.
#. Hypoxia: Pt initially felt to be a vasculopath with poor
pleth and inaccurate peripheral O2 sat [**Location (un) 1131**] resulting in
likely premature intubation.  CXR c/w pulm edema which may have
improved with BiPAP. However, pt was already intubated. No signs
of PNA on CXR. PE less likely with INR>4 on coumadin, PaO2>400
which also suggests otherwise.  On HD#2 pt with increased sputum
production, with sputum cx positive for GNR.  He was continued
on vanco/ctx empirically for ?sepsis as below, however CTA was
negative for consolidation or PE.  He was transitioned to PS on
HD#2.
.
Sputum cultures speciated enterbacter with intermediate
sensitivity to ceftriaxone on [**10-4**], so pt switched to cefepime.
2nd GNR isolate speciated to citrobacter, both were sensitive to
[**Last Name (LF) 9847**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] pt was started on [**First Name3 (LF) 9847**] on [**10-7**], with plan for 14d
course (day 1 [**10-7**]).  Pt extubated [**10-5**], without difficulty,
though had been some concern regarding periods of sinus pauses
(up to 10 seconds) with coughing on the vent, felt [**3-1**] increased
vagal tone.  EP consult obtained, as below, felt pauses were [**3-1**]
pulmonary disease and vagal tone, without intrinsic conduction
disease.  On [**10-10**] pt stable on 2L NC x 2d.  He was treated with
albuterol/atrovent nebs prn.
.
Pt weaned off O2 gradually (goal O2 sat > 90%), with plan to
complete 14 d course [**Month/Year (2) 9847**]. Still with O2 by NC requirement, has
been satting in mid-90s with 2-3L NC stably. Given emphysema
seen on CXR may continue to need O2 chronically but should
reassess as edema/CHF continues to improve.
.
#. GIB: pt with melena per OSH records in setting of
supratherapeutic INR, unclear hx of GIB or colonoscopy done.  Pt
received factor IX in ED for unclear reasons, and was given 2U
PRBC without bump in HCT (27->28).  ASA and coumadin where held,
PPI IV BID started, GI consult obtained, however EGD deferred
given ongoing hypotension.  Serial HCT were stable 27-28
throughout MICU stay, no recurrence of melena.  Per GI, plan was
to obtain re-consult once pt stable and on floor for
EGD/colonoscopy.  On [**10-9**], pt underwent EGD [**10-10**] (no colonoscopy
[**3-1**] unable to complete prep [**3-1**] n/v and MS changes).  EGD showed
?varices, though not clearly varices.  GI deferred inpatient
repeat EGD and colonoscopy, but hope to do this later within the
next month, as his health status continues to improve, and
perhaps after variceal banding.
.
We continued to hold coumadin and anticoagulation as risk of
variceal bleed remains considerable, balance is of risk from GIB
versus several week risk of stroke from atrial fibrillation; GIB
risk appears at this point to be more severe and immediately
worrying.
.
For follow up on GI bleeding and arranging for possible
procedures, an appointment was made with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1407**], of the
gastoenterology department, who had seen pt while he was inpt.
.
.
#. Hypotension: admit SBP 74/55, etiology unclear, ddx sepsis vs
volume loss [**3-1**] GIB vs some component of pump failure (RV vs
LV).  pt initially covered with vanco/clind for concern for
cellulitis.  clinda d/c'd on HD#1 in favor of CTX for broader
coverage.  he was started on dopamine gtt HD#1, switched to
levophed given excess tachycardia on dopa gtt.  TTE revealed
severe RV dysfunction raising concern for PE, however LENI
