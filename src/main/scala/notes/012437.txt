Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 633**]
Chief Complaint:
subdural hematoma/falls

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] y.o male with h.o CAD s/p CABG, AS, afib on asa, CHF
EF 50%, DM2, PAD, HTN, CRI, DM2, GERD, "urinary problems",who
presented from OSH for evaluation of SDH.
Per pt's son, pt with multiple falls recently. Had a fall in the
driveway 4 months ago where he apparently "broke his nose" and
coumadin was stopped. Pt went to rehab, but per pt's son, has
remained weak since that time. [**Name (NI) 1094**] son reports "at least" [**3-5**]
falls since then. [**Name (NI) 1094**] son reports that pt never complains of
anything and often just toughs things out. [**Name (NI) 1094**] son also
reported that pt has been complaining of "feeling lousy" and
having a "bad headache" for some time. [**Name (NI) 1094**] son reports that
complaints of headache likely preceded the last fall "a few
weeks ago". [**Name (NI) 1094**] son does not recall an other complaints and
reports that his father is usually "sharp as a tack". Complaints
of feeling lousy and headache prompted the admission to OSH.
.
At OSH, CT reportedly showed 6mm R.sided SDH without shift. Pt
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Neurosurg eval in ED stated no acute
issues. Follow up in 4 weeks, start keppra. Per neurosurgery and
ED notes, pt had an intact neuro exam without any facial
assymetry noted.
.
In the ED:
US of RLE at OSH negative for DVT

Radiology:
CXR [**10-28**]-
IMPRESSION: Moderate congestive heart failure.

Head CT: IMPRESSION:
1. No significant change in size of the subdural hematoma
overlying the right cerebral hemisphere. Associated right
hemispheric sulcal effacement and compression of the right
lateral ventricle are also unchanged. No significant midline
shift or central herniation.
2. Unchanged minimal left parafalcine subdural hematoma.
3. No new intracranial hemorrhage.
4. No evidence of acute large vascular territorial infarction.

CXR [**10-29**]: Mild pulmonary edema persists in the left lung. There
is greater
consolidation in the perihilar right lung than there was before,
which could
be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema, but raises concern for
pneumonia, could
be due to large scale aspiration. Moderate-to-severe
cardiomegaly stable.
Pleural effusions are small if any.

Echocardiogram: Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF=
25%) with regional akinesis of the septum, anterior and apical
walls. The remaining segments are hypokinetic. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with
severe global free wall hypokinesis. The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is at least
moderate (low gradient/low output) aortic valve stenosis (valve
area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation
is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

[**10-31**] Head CT: IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of 7-mm right
convexity subdural hematoma and
small left parafalcine subdural hematoma. No new focal
hemorrhage or
increased mass effect.

[**11-1**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This EEG in the awake and drowsy states
demonstrated a
waking background that was slightly slower than the normal alpha
frequency range. This is a common finding at an advanced age but
is
non-specific in etiology. No focal or epileptiform features were
seen.
Note is made of an irregular cardiac rhythm.

[**11-2**] video swallowing study:
IMPRESSION: Gross aspiration and penetration of nectar thick and
thin barium
with significant amount of residue in the vallecula. Other
consistencies of
barium were not administered due to safety concerns.

[**11-3**] CXR: Cardiomegaly is severe. Mediastinum is stable. There
is slight interval
improvement in pulmonary edema and substantial improvement in
the right lung
opacities consistent with resolution of infectious process.
Small amount of
pleural effusion cannot be excluded in conjunction with
currently mild
interstitial edema. No pneumothorax is seen.

[**11-4**] CXR: Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly and widened
mediastinum are stable. The main
pulmonary arteries are enlarged. Diffuse opacities in the right
lung and
opacities in the left lower lobe have worsened in the right
lung, consistent
with worseni
