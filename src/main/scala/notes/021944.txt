Again, this was a 47-year-old female admitted with Berkitt's
lymphoma.

HOSPITAL COURSE OVER THESE PREVIOUS DAYS:
1. Liver lesions:  The patient went for a repeat MRI which
showed no change in the previously noted enumerable hepatic
cyst in her liver.  A Hepatology consult was obtained who
felt that the most likely etiology of these cysts were from
hepatic candidiasis, although one could not rule out lymphoma
involving from Burkitt's.  She will be discharged on AmBisome
300 mg IV q.d. for treatment of her hepatic candidiasis.

This regimen, that being AmBisome, was recommended by the
Infectious Disease physicians, who felt that AmBisome was a
better drug of choice as compared to fluconazole.

2. Heme:  The patient's platelets, white count, and
hematocrit have all been stable.  Her white count remained
elevated despite discontinuing her G-CSF.  However, the
patient is not febrile and her white count should be
continued to be watched.

3. On the morning of [**12-4**], the patient had some
transient episodes of hypotension with SBPs in the 70s.  Her
captopril was discontinued, and she was given two IV fluid
boluses with appropriate response.  Her blood pressures and
all of her vital signs are stable.

couple days.  She is also started on marinol 2.5 mg p.o.
