Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Increased dyspnea on exertion


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2168-4-13**]
1. Mitral valve replacement with a size 27-mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] Epic
    tissue valve.
2. Left atrial appendage ligation.
3. Maze procedure with radiofrequency ablation probe.
4. Closure of patent foramen ovale.
5. Coronary artery bypass graft x1:  Saphenous vein graft
    to posterior descending artery.
6. Removal of suspected fibroelastoma from the aortic
    valve.


History of Present Illness:
77 year-old female who was admitted to [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**2168-4-3**]
with worsening dyspnea on exertion and was found to be in acute
diastolic heart failure and recurrent atrial fibrillation. She
reports she has been SOB since [**Month (only) **].
It has progressively gotten worse to the point that she could
not take a shower or wash her face without getting SOB. She also
has had worsening palpitations and knows she has been in Afib
more often than usual since then. On the evening of admission to
[**Hospital1 46**] she "thought she was going to die" so called the
ambulance and was taken to the OSH ED. Initial ECG showed afib
with rate in
the 90s and chronic LBBB. She was given IV Lasix and bipap and
after a few hours felt better. She underwent an echo which
showed [**4-1**] + MR (worse from previous echos) and regional wall
motion abnormalities. EF was reportedly at 50-55%.  She is being
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation of her mitral
regurgitation. She has been referred to cardiac surgery for
evaluation of a mitral valve replacement.

TEE Intra-op [**2168-4-13**]
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus is seen in the
left atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is present. A
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest.

Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %). The septal wall appears to be
dyskinetic, although this may be due to dyssynchrony (the septal
wall does not thin during systole.)

Right ventricular chamber size is normal. The RV systolic
function is borderline normal.

There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No thoracic aortic
dissection is seen.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis. There is a filamentous mobile strand on the tip
of the right coronary cusp that is concerning for fibroelastoma.
The non-cororary cusp appears slightly redundant. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. A moderate to severe (3+) central jet of
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate MAC.

POST-CPB:
There is a bioprosthetic valve in the mitral position. The valve
is well-seated with normal leaflet mobility. The native MV
support structures are still in place. There is trace central
MR, there is no paravalvular leak. The peak gradient across the
mitral valve is 14mmHg, the mean gradient is 6mmHg with CO 4.5.

The filamentous structure on the aortic valve is no longer seen,
consistent resection. There is no AS or AI.

There is no residual PFO after PFO repair.

The LV systolic function appears improved with the patient being
on Epi, Norepi, and Milrinone infusions; estimated EF = 45%. The
septal wall shows dyssynchronous movement. The RV is mildly
hypokinetic.

There is no aortic dissection.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results at the
time of study.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2168-4-13**] where
the patient underwent MVReplacement with 27mm tissue valve,
CABG, PFO closure, Maze  Overall the patient tolerated the
procedure well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU
in stable condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 1
found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing
comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact and
hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor
support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient was gently
diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  Amiodarone was
initiated for atrial fibrillation.  The patient did go into
complete heart block.  EP was consulted and antiarrhythmics were
discontinued.  Transvenous wire was placed.  She progressed to
junctional rhythm and eventually to sinus rhythm.  Atrial
fibrillation returned and beta blocker was resumed. She did
convert to sinus rhythm and transvenous wire was removed.
Anticoagulation was resumed for atrial fibrillation after wire
was removed. She is to take 7.5 mg Coumadin on [**4-22**] for atrial
fibrillation with INR to be checked [**4-23**] for goal INR [**3-3**].  The
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By
the time of discharge on POD 9, the patient was ambulating with
assistance, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with
oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to the [**Hospital 1319**]
