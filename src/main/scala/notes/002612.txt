Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4327**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension in cardiology clinic

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female admitted for hypotension,
fevers, leukocytosis, and decreased PO intake x1 week.  Pt is
mildly disoriented and a poor historian at time of admission.
The pt has a PMHx of CAD s/p CABG x3, severe aortic stenosis s/p
valvuloplasty [**4-4**] with improved ischemic & valvular
cardiomyopathy (EF 50% in [**6-4**]), who was sent in from
cardiology clinic after a routine scheduled visit showed that
the pt had a leukocytosis, hypotensive reportedly to SBP 80s (BP
80/40, T 100.7, WBC 16 in nursing home today), and fever to 101.
 For that she was sent to the ED.  The pt reports that if she
weren't referred to the ED that she wouldn't have wanted to go
by herself.  The pt at the time of clinic visit had no chief
complaint except decreased PO intake x1 week, and increased b/l
leg edema, but reports that she is normally edematous.  Pt
denies SOB and CP, no abdominal pain, no change to bowel or
bladder habbit, no headache, no neck pain, no change in vision,
no new confusion.  Patient reportly endorsed minimal dry cough
reported by cardiologist but denies to us.
.
In the more recent past, the patient was recently admitted with
pancolitis in [**7-30**] through [**2131-8-2**].  During that stay she was
treated non-operatively, had two negative C.diff toxins, and
that the pt improved with medical management, and was
subsequently discharged from the hospital on [**8-2**].  On the day of
discharge she suffered a fall at home that resulted in a
subdural hematoma and the pt was re-admitted here for neuro
checks, during which time the pt's coumadin and asprin were
stopped. She was discharged to a rehab facility and over the
past week she has felt progressively weaker with less energy.
Notes from the rehab facility indicate that about a week ago her
blood pressures started to drop. On [**8-8**] her lisinopril and
lasix were both held for hypotension and her BP has not
recovered.  Of note, during past admission and clinic visits her
BP has been in the 80's to the low 110's.
.
Even more distantly, the pt is s/p a balloon aortic
valvuloplasty in [**2131-3-25**], which was complicated by a CVA
without lingering defiecits.  Intervally after that the pt had a
repeat echo which showed that her LVEF improved from 25% to 50%.

.
In the ED, initial VS were 97.6, 74, 89/42, 20, 93%RA. Labs were
notable for WBC 16.3 w/85% polys & no bands and BNP [**Numeric Identifier 27150**] (was
[**Numeric Identifier 18214**] on [**2131-7-30**]). Troponin <0.01 & lactate 1.8. Hematocrit
stable at 32; creatinine 1.5 (recent baseline 1.2-1.6). UA
negative; 10 hyaline casts. Patient received ~300cc fluid.
Bedside U/S showed collapsing IVC, was negative for pericardial
effusion. CXR with no acute process. Blood cultures were sent
and she was started empirically on vancomycin 1g IV,
levofloxacin 750mg IV, flagyl 500mg IV. Given ongoing
hypotension, a left IJ central venous line was placed and she
was started on levophed (currently SBP 110s on levophed @
0.09mcg/min). An hour prior to transfer in the ED, had a rectal
temp 100.8. VS on transfer were 99.6 PO, HR 94, 105/48, 21,
100%RA.
