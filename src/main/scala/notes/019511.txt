Brief Hospital Course:
.
72 yo M c history of CAD s/p mid LAD [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 20%, DM2, CRI
baseline cr 2.1, presented to ED with unstable angina, found to
have ST depressions V4-V6, taken to emergent cath without
intervention, developed pulmonary edema, intubated, became
hypotensive after propofol, transferred to CCU, still with
pressor requirements.
.
Echo [**2128-1-7**]:
LV EF 20% mod dilated LV, global dysfxn. E:A 0.92
TR gradient 40 RV nl size/fxn
3+MR, trace AR, [**1-4**]+TR.
.
Cath [**2128-9-24**]:
R dominant system
LMCA: 70% diffuse
LAD: diffuse dz patent [**Month/Day/Year **]. 80% diag.
LCX: total occlusion ostial, R-->L collaterals
.
. Cardiovascular
PUMP: Cardiogenic Shock.CHF. Initially low CI and high SVR out
of cath [**Month/Day/Year **], Alternately on milrinone +/- dobuta but SVR low,
continued VT, weaned off [**9-30**] PM for SVR in 500s w/ CI [**3-5**]. ?
Numbers today looked worse with increasing SVR and lower C0/CI
(1.35).  Sepsis vs med effect, holding MAPs 50s-60s now on
levophed alone. Levophed was attempted to wean, thought
contributory to ar's, started vasopressin. Still on lidocaine.
MAPs still low, sometimes down to 40s, levophed turned back up,
now at 0.183. Last TTE EF 20%, mod-severe MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] family, LVAD
is no longer an option.  IABP is not an option either.  CVVHD
currenlty on, patient is still net positive due to all the IV
drips.  CO/CI was dropping overnight prior to withdrawal of
care--discussed starting another pressor/ionotrope. During the
last 2 days before withdrawal of care, the MAPs and CI/CO were
dropping despite the max doses of levophed and continious CVVHD
removing fluid every day.  Patient's family and HCP decided that
he is not going to be going for LVAD and decided to withdraw
care in agreement with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], patient's cardiologist.
.
ISCHEMIA: s/p NSTEMI, 3v-d on cath. Not a candiadate for CABG as
he has poor targets. Cath [**9-30**] for mid RCA x 3 BMS, LMCA x
Cypher DES . Pt's CKs leveling off depsite the continued shocks
that he is receiving. However, persistent v-fib may be still
related to ischemia.  Ultimately, the multiple shocks were
thought to be due to multiple scar foci within the heart, the
territory that was not possible to re-vascularize with multiple
coronary interventions.
.
RHYTHM: Persistent VT/VF while ischemic, and post-cath
reperfusion VT/VF vs ongoing ischemia/demand. EP switched DDI =>
DDD, but PMTs induced => back to DDI. VT controlled with amio
gtt (increased for 1200 mg/d); lido loaded, now, on maintenance
drip. On milrinone right after cath [**Month/Year (2) **], but that was
subsequently stopped since it was thought to be more ar-genic.
2 days prior to CMO, had a series of at least 20 shocks for
going into v-fib. Was re-bolused with amio and lidocaine.  Upon
withdrawal of care was on amio and lidocaine drips.  Some
ectopy, no runs of vfib/vtack overnight prior to CMO.
.
2. Pulm: Hypoxia. day 7 of intubation, on levo/flagyl for HAP in
RML. gr stain grew out psedomonas, sensies pending. Hemoptysis
from ETT [**10-1**] AM, resolved now, likely high PA pressures/CHF in
setting of suctioning; differential includes PE, evolving
PNA/tracheobronchitis.  Patient dropping sats with bloody
suctioning from ETT, PEEP and FiO2 increased, latest gas shows
good oxygenation, satting 97%. During the day continued to
desat, PaO2 75, PEEP and FiO2 increased.  Oxygenation
dramatically improved, and CO went up to 4 with higher PEEP.
Since then, PEEP and FiO2 decreased to 10/0.4--however CO/CI has
decreased with the PEEP decreasing. Patient was oxygenating well
when care was withdrawn.
.
3. Renal/FEN: AoCRF on CVVHD. Cr up, UOP down. Likely
maintenance ATN. CVVH now via R fem line. ? CHF vs dye
nephropathy, Cr currenlty dropping with CVVHD.  Unable to keep
negative every hour, some hours negative, patient is off CVVHD
with more insult due to recent dye load for cath. decreasing
urine output. goal neg 1-2L/day.  There is an issue with CVVH
line clotting/ started on heparin drip to keep line open.
heparin--HIT ab negative. Patient was on CVVHD when care was
removed.
.
4. ID: Hosp aquired PNA (post-intubation aspiration), on
Vanc/Zosyn x 2 days, was on Levo/Flagyl (day 3 on [**10-1**] x 10 day
course). WBC falling, afebrile. Only + U/Cx on [**9-24**] w/ levo-S
enterococcus. Sputum/Cx with PsA, + PMNs. On Zosyn, afebrile [**Doctor First Name **]
care was removed.

.
13. Communication: with wife and family.  Care was withdrawn on
Friday, [**2128-10-1**]. Family decline an autopsy.
