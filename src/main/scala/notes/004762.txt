REASON FOR ADMISSION:  The patient is a 67-year-old male with
a history of coronary artery disease, status post cadaveric
renal transplant on [**2134-1-13**], recently admitted from
[**2134-3-12**] to [**2134-3-17**] for increased creatinine.  Biopsy of
the kidney showed partial mild rejection.  He was given pulse
Solu-Medrol.  The patient had shortness of breath with
electrocardiogram changes with flipped T's.  The patient had
a cardiac catheterization on [**2134-3-16**] which showed three
vessel coronary artery disease with a 95% circumflex coronary
artery, a 70% left anterior descending artery and an 80%
right coronary artery.  The echocardiogram showed an ejection
fraction of 30% to 35% with moderate aortic regurgitation.
The patient decided to undergo coronary artery bypass graft
surgery.

The patient was discharged to home.  However, on the morning
of [**2134-3-24**] at 4:30 AM, the patient developed some mild
wheezing with inspiration and [**3-25**] in severity shortness of
breath.  The patient was then admitted to [**Hospital1 346**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history was
significant for coronary artery disease, status post
cadaveric renal transplant, a history of diabetes mellitus
and a history of EFD times three years.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The head, eyes, ears, nose and throat
examination was within normal limits.  The neck had no
jugular venous distention or bruits.  The lungs were clear.
The cor was a regular rate and rhythm with a II/VI systolic
ejection murmur.  The abdomen was benign.  The extremities
revealed a small amount of bilateral edema.  The neurological
examination was nonfocal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the medical
service, who consulted the cardiac surgery service.  The
patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**], who reported that the patient
was a surgical candidate.  He was also seen by the renal
fellow and the renal service as well as the transplant
service, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16495**].  The renal service saw the patient and
felt that his Epogen dose was very high and decreased it.

At this time, the patient was ready to go to the operating
room for cardiac surgery.  On [**2134-3-25**], the patient was
taken to the operating room and underwent off-pump coronary
artery bypass graft surgery times four.  He tolerated the
procedure well.  He was transferred to the cardiothoracic
intensive care unit in satisfactory, hemodynamically stable
condition.  Please refer to the operative note for full
details of the procedure.

In the cardiothoracic intensive care unit, the patient was
extubated and was doing well.  He was followed closely by the
renal fellow as well as the transplant service.  He then was
transferred to the sixth floor, where he continued to do
well.  The renal service saw the patient and made
suggestions, starting him back on his Bactrim Steri-Strips
with a change in his MMF to 500 mg.  We also changed his
Epogen dose and thought that the patient was doing well.

The physical therapy service was up with the patient.  He was
walking.  He was then felt stable enough to be discharged
home on [**2135-3-30**].
