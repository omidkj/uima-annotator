Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted on late sunday evening, [**2128-2-22**] for
hemodialysis prior to planned right upper lobectomy for squamous
cell carcinoma. On [**2128-2-23**] he was taken to the operating by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) **]. for Right thoracotomy. Lysis of adhesions.
Right upper lobectomy with en bloc resection of ribs 2, 3 and 4.
and Mediastinal lymphadenectomy.  He was transfer to the TSICU
intubated and sedated.  He had 3 chest tubes to suction, Foley
and Epidural managed by the acute pain service.  On [**2128-2-24**] he
was successfully extubated.  Aggressive nebs and pulmonary
toilet his oxygen requirements improved to room air prior to
discharge.  He was followed by renal for ESRD and underwent
dialysis which was discontinued secondary to hypotension after
removal of 1 Liter. His hypotension improved with SBP 140's. His
chest tubes were placed to water-seal and 4hr f/u CXR showed
increase right apical pneumothorax. They were placed back to
suction with f/u CXR showing lung re-expansion.  His diet was
advanced as tolerated. On [**2128-2-25**] he transfer to the floor in
stable condition.

Respiratory: incentive spirometer, nebs and good pain control
his oxygen requirments improved.

Chest-tubes: 3 chest tubes, 2 apically and 1 along the right
hemidiaphragm with persistent air-leak.  On [**2128-2-25**] the suction
was decreased to 10 cm H20 from 20.
Chest tube were changed to water-seal [**2128-2-26**] without
persistent airleak.  Right hemidiaphragm chest tube was removed
on [**2128-2-26**]. [**2128-2-27**] another apical chest tube was discontinued
without airleak. On [**2-28**] the final chest tube was dc'd with
postpull chest film revealing stable R apical air space.

Cardiac:  Beta-blockers were initially continued.  On [**2128-2-26**]
he developed rapid atrial fibrillation in the 140's and was
given metoprolol 5 mg IV x 3, with transient decrease in heart
rate. He then received amiodarone 150 mg IV, followed by
amiodarone gtt at 1 mg/min, with conversion to sinus rhythm.
Amiodarone gtt was stopped at around 3 a.m., and the patient was
started on amiodarone at a dose of 400 mg TID. He then went back
into rapid AF with ventricular rate 140s, for which he received
diltiazem 10 mg IV, however then had conversion pauses, up to 8
seconds. . Cardiology was consulted, and given the 8 second
pauses the patient was watched over the night in CCU. The
patient remained in sinus rhythm once converting, however had 2
minutes of rapid afib on [**2128-2-27**] without hemodynamic instablity.
He will followup with cardiology as an outpatient. All other
nodal blockers were held, until [**2128-2-27**], when labetolol 150mg po
bid restarted, and titrated to 300mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**2128-2-28**], which he
tolerated well. His blood pressures were also high which we
slowly worked on adding home BP medications for control.
Cardiology recommended that patient be sent home with all of his
home medications, amiodarone will not be continued upon
discharge.

GI: Advanced diet to regular renal and tolerated.

Renal: ESRD followed by renal. HD continue, last on Saturday
[**2128-2-28**]. Chemistries watched closely.  Home renal medications
were restarted.

Extremity: Right arm edema noted Upper Extremity US showed no
DVT on [**2128-2-27**].

Heme: He received a transfusion for 2 units of PRBC's
intraoperatively.

Pain: Hydromorphone and bupivicaine Epidural was used for
postoperative pain management, with good effect. The patient
self dc'd on accident the epidural [**2128-2-27**] a few hours prior to
planned dc of epidural by APS. Heparin was held. The patient's
pain was controlled with oxycodone and tylenol thereafter.

Disposition: He was seen by physical therapy on [**2128-2-27**] who
recommended home with PT.

At the time of discharge on [**2128-2-29**] Mr [**Known lastname **] was afebrile, vital
signs were stable, he was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating
and voiding without assistance. He received discharge teaching
and follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and
agreement with the discharge plan.
