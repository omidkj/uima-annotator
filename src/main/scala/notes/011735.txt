Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization

History of Present Illness:
76-yo-woman referred from [**Hospital3 3583**] w/ NSTEMI. She was
feeling well until 20 hours ago, when she developed subacute
onset substernal chest pain radiating to both shoulders, L>R, w/
no dyspnea, palps, nausea, or diaphoresis. The pain persisted
throughout the day, prompting her to present to [**Hospital3 3583**]
12 hours ago. There, she was found to have ST depressions on EKG
leads V2-V6, CK 1000 w/ elevated trop I. She was treated w/ ASA
325 mg and nitro gtt. Concern for possible aortic dissection
precluded further anti-platelet therapy, and she was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
In our ED, BP was 160 and HR 100. She complained of continuing
chest pain, [**3-4**] severity. Repeat CK was 1893 w/ MB 271 and trop
3.07. Cardiology consultants recommended further therapy w/
plavix 600 mg, metoprolol 25 mg PO, heparin gtt, and integrillin
gtt. Chest pain resolved w/ medical therapy, and she is now
admitted to the CCU for ongoing management.
.
Currently, she denies any chest pain, palps, dyspnea. ROS
reveals no fever, chills, weight loss, abd pain, hematuria,
diarrhea, melena, or hematochezia. She does have intermittently
productive cough for 6 weeks, which seems to have started after
she began lisinopril therapy.

CARDIAC CATH:
COMMENTS:     1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant
system
demonstrated an LMCA free of angiographically significant
disease. The
LAD had minimal, non flowlimiting disease. The RCA was without
angiographically apparent disease. The LCX was totally occluded
proximally.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated systemic
arterial
pressures.
3. Initial access was attempted via the right femoral artery,
but this
was unsucessful due to severe PVD. The right radial artery was
then
prepped and accessed without incident.
4. PCI

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. PCI of LCX
.
ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is moderate regional
left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the basal and
mid-segments
of the inferior, inferolateral and lateral walls (left
circumflex coronary
artery distribution). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle.
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg) and Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right
ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are three
moderately
thickened aortic valve leaflets. There is mild valvular aortic
stenosis (valve
area 1.2-1.9 cm2). The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate calcification of the
posterior
mitral annulus and moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae, but no
mitral stenosis. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a small
pericardial
effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.

IMPRESSION: Moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction c/w CAD.
Mild calcific aortic stenosis.

.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the CCU following her cardiac
catheterization for a circumflex artery ST elevation MI. Her
circumflex artery was re-opened and a bare metal stent was
placed. Despite a massive CK and troponin elevation, she was
hemodynamically stable.  An echocardiogram revealed a left
ventricular ejection fraction between 30% to 35%.  The patient
was started on low dose ASA (as she was also anticoagulated for
AFIB) and plavix.  Home prevastatin was discontinued and
atorvastatin 80mg was started.  The patient could likely do with
a repeat echocardiogram in 6 weeks.
.
She had minor probelms with oxygenation secondary to volume
overload from intra and post-cath IV fluids as well as COPD. She
was diuresed and her COPD was treated with inhaled
bronchodialtors and steroids.
.
There was some concern on an OSH chest X-ray for a pneumonia,
but she was not initiated on antibiotic therapy as clinically
she did not appear to have a pneumonia.
.
She had a 12 hour long episode of atrial fibrillation 2 days
prior to discharge.  She was loaded on amiodarone, given and
taught how to use lovenox, started on coumadin, and discharged
with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of hearts monitor to test for recurrent Afib and
assess her QT interval.
.
On the day of discharge the patient's creatinine was slightly
elevated from baseline at 2.1.  This was likely related to
contrast nephropathy and aggressive diuresis.  The patient's
lisinopril was decreased.  The patient was not sent on lasix.
.
Follow up was arranged with the patient's PCP and with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 3321**] in the department of Cardiology.
