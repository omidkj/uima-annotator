Pertinent Results:
[**2182-10-21**] Intra op ECHO
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild
hypokinesia of the apex, apical portion of the anterior wall and
the mid anteroseptal wall. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on
[**2182-10-21**] at 900am.
Post revascularization biventricular systolic function is
unchanged. Mild mitral regurgitation persists.

Final Report
FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest obtained with patient
sitting in
upright position is analyzed in direct comparison with the next
preceding
similar study obtained two hours earlier. During the interval,
the left-sided chest tube has been removed. No pneumothorax has
developed. Previously described mild degree of left lateral
blunting of the pleural sinus and hazy retrocardiac density
remain unchanged. No new abnormalities are seen and no pulmonary
congestion is present.
IMPRESSION:
No pneumothorax after chest tube removal in patient recently
undergoing off pump LIMA-coronary bypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 83588**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2182-10-18**] for surgical
management of his coronary artery disease. He was worked-up in
the usual preoperative manner. On [**2182-10-21**] Mr. [**Known lastname 83588**] was taken
to the operating room where he underwent an endoscopic left
internal mammary harvest followed by off-pump coronary artery
bypass grafting to the left anterior descending artery via a
left anterior mini thoracotomy. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit
for monitoring. Over the next few hours, he awoke neurologically
intact and was extubated. Beta blockade, aspirin and a statin
were resumed. The next day he was transferred to the step down
unit for further post operative management. He was gently
diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The physical therapy
service was consulted for assistance with his postoperative
strength and mobility.
The remainder of his post operative course was uneventful. He
was discharged home with visiting nurses on POD2
