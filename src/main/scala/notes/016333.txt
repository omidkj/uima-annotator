Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Substernal chest pressure and shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization
Percutaneous cholecystostomy

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 yo patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with CAD and h/o
anteroseptal QWMI, s/p CABG [**2097**] (left-dominant system;
LIMA-LAD, SVG-PDA, SVG-OM2.  known ocluded SVG to PDA and OM2
with backfilling) with NSTEMI [**1-/2111**] treated with stents to LCX
and L-PDA, CHF with EF 35-40%, HTN, and hyperlipidemia.  He had
been feeling fatigued/lethargic as per his wife but with was in
his usual state of cardiac health (able to walk [**1-27**]-mile without
chest pain or shortness of breath; no orthopnea, no PND, no
peripheral edema) until sunday evening around 3AM when he awoke
with dyspnea and substernal chest pressure that felt like an
"[**Location (un) 2452**] stuck in his chest."  He thinks the pain may have
radiated to the shoulder, he did have diaphoresis (which he
attributed to symptomatic hypoglycemia), shortness of breath,
and feeling "off balance."  He ignored his chest discomfort for
several hours and decided the next morning to visit his PCP who
sent him via ambulance to [**Hospital6 **] at 1:30pm.
En-route to the hospital he was given 1 spray of sL
nitroglycerine which relieved his chest pain permenantly.  At
NWH his EKG revealed lateral ST depressions and his CK was
positive at 660, Trop 8.8.  He was started on heparin drip; had
already taken aspirin.  His initial vital signs were P 74, BP
123/60, RR 28, T 100.2 axillary, 95% on RA.  CXR showed mild CHF
and later he was placed on 100%NRB for hypoxia and given 40mg IV
lasix without response.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization.
.
Also significant to his history is an axillary temperature of
100.2 at the OSH with several days of feeling fatigued,
lethargic, with poor appetite.  He denies any abdominal pain,
nausea, or vomiting.  His platelets were noted to be 100 down
from a baseline of 250 and Hct of 25 down from a baseline of 30.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He does report recent T to 100.2 axillary
but denies chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or
calf pain. He denies abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting although
he did notice abdominal pain when his PCP pressed on his RUQ and
again when this maneuver was done here.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.

V4-V6.
.
EKG on presentation to CCU: NSR with TW flattening in all axial
leads, 1-[**Street Address(2) 1766**] depression and TWI in V4-V6.
.
CXR [**2111-8-24**]: Mild cardiomegaly with increased moderate
congestive heart
failure and increased left lower lobe atelectasis.  Superimposed
infection in left lower lobe cannot be excluded.
.
RUQ US [**2111-8-24**]: mild GB wall edema, with mild GB wall edema of
3mm, GB distension w/o stones or sludge.  concern for acute
acalculous cholcystitis.
.
ECHO
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall  left ventricular systolic function is
moderately depressed (LVEF= 30 %) with  global hypokinesis and
regional akinesis of the inferior and infero-lateral  walls.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There is moderate
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root
is mildly dilated at  the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic  stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve  leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation
is  seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild  pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
 Compared to the prior study (images reviewed) dated [**2111-1-27**],
the overall LVEF has decreased and the severity of mitral
regurgitation has increased.

vessels. Final
angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically
apparent
dissection and timi 3 flow (see ptca comments).
Summary: Successful PTCA of the LCX/OM/Left PDA.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
