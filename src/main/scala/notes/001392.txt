HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63-year old
female with a past medical history of stage III lung cancer
(status post chemotherapy, XRT, and left pneumonectomy in
[**2150-2-16**]), left lower extremity DVT, hypertension,
atrial fibrillation, and recent C. difficile colitis. She was
discharged from [**Hospital1 69**] on [**4-14**] following a prolonged hospitalization with respiratory
failure and left pneumonectomy. Since this time she has
resided at [**Hospital1 700**]. Her course at [**Hospital1 5593**] was complicated by pneumonia (for which she was
treated with Levaquin), left lower extremity DVT (for which
she is Coumadin), C. difficile colitis and altered mental
status (thought secondary to cerebral hypoxia during her long
surgery), prerenal azotemia, and most recently hypotension.
On [**2150-5-21**] she had a systolic pressure down to the 70s
which improved to 90s with an IV fluid bolus. However, given
persistent hypotension and multiple medical problems she was
transferred back to [**Hospital3 **] MICU for further management.

On arrival she was noted to be hypotensive with systolic
pressures to the 80s and tachycardic, in rapid AFib to the
160s. The patient was given a IV boluses with mild
improvement in blood pressure. A chest x-ray was notable for
a right upper lobe infiltrate and right pleural effusion. She
was also noted to have increased secretion. In the emergency
department she received vancomycin, ceftazidime, Flagyl, and
Solu-Medrol for possible bronchospasms. No fevers reported.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Tobacco abuse (100-pack-year), stage
III lung cancer diagnosed in the Fall of [**2148**], status post
left pneumonectomy complicated by respiratory failure and
tracheostomy placement, status post chemotherapy and XRT,
status post J-tube insertion, thrombocytopenia with possible
HIT, hypothyroidism, DVT of left upper extremity,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atrial fibrillation, CHF,
pleural effusions, C. difficile colitis, pneumonia.

ALLERGIES:  A possible allergy to HEPARIN (HIT).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  A 100-pack-year history of tobacco. No
alcohol. No drugs. Married. Son recently died.

MEDICATIONS:  Epogen 10,000 units q. Thursday, iron 300
daily, Prevacid 30 daily, Synthroid 25 daily, Lopressor 50
b.i.d., Flagyl 500 t.i.d., Coumadin 4 mg daily, digoxin 0.25
daily, amiodarone 400 daily, Compazine 10 mg p.r.n., Tylenol
p.r.n., Ultracal 30 mL/h.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature of 99.3, blood pressure of
80/40, heart rate of 93, ventilator SIMV with pressure
support of 18, 450 x 20, 0.4, saturating 95%. HEENT revealed
anicteric. The mucous membranes were moist. The neck was
supple. Tracheostomy site was clear. CV was irregular. No
murmur. Lungs with decreased left breath sounds. Scattered
rhonchi and exploratory wheeze, predominantly on the right.
Abdomen was soft and nontender. J-tube site was clear. Groin
with right femoral line. Extremities with 2+ lower extremity
edema and 2+ left upper extremity edema. Heel with a small 1-
cm ulceration. The skin with numerous ecchymoses on the upper
extremities, black fungating lesion on the abdomen. On
neurologic exam, unable to speak with PMV response to
commands. Moved all extremities. Toes were down. Reflexes
were 1+ throughout.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count of 13.6 (down from 15.7),
hematocrit of 28.4, MCV of 105, platelets of 117. Sodium of
147, potassium of 4.1, chloride of 102, bicarbonate of 40,
BUN of 36, creatinine of 0.2, glucose of 72. INR of 2.2.
Cortisol level was pending. Digoxin was 0.7. ABG revealed
7.53/54/64, lactate of 1. Urinalysis with 0 to 2 white blood
cells, negative nitrites, negative leukocytes.

RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  A chest x-ray with tracheostomy in
satisfactory position. Status post a left pneumonectomy.
Right upper lobe and right lower lobe alveolar opacification.
Moderate bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax.

EKG with AFib.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Throughout course the patient
   remained dependent on ventilator despite treatment with
   antibiotics and diuresis of pleural effusions.

1. HYPOTENSION: Initially thought secondary to hypovolemia,
   however did not improve with IVF administration. The
   patient was administered broad spectrum antibiotics and
   stress-dose steroids, but remained on Levophed throughout
   most of hospital stay.

1. INFECTION: Treated for nosocomial pneumonia with broad
   spectrum coverage. Remained afebrile for most of stay.

1. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Rate controlled as blood pressure
   tolerated with beta blocker, amiodarone, and digoxin.

1. C. DIFF. COLITIS: Continued Flagyl.

1. UPPER EXTREMITY DVT: Continued Coumadin. Hesitant to
   heparinize in the setting of possible history of HIT.

1. MIXED ACID BASE DISORDER: With respiratory acidosis and
   concomitant metabolic alkalosis either due to compensation
   contraction alkalosis and benign prerenal azotemia
   secondary to hypovolemia. Improved somewhat with IV fluid
   hydration.

1. MEDULLARY BLEED: On [**2150-5-31**] the patient was noted to
   have asymmetric pupils and decreased responsive. A STAT
   head CT revealed medullary bleed with cervical cord and
   possible pontine involvement. Neurology was consulted.
   Anticoagulation was held, and she received FFP and
   protamine. Neurosurgery did not have further
   recommendations. She was given Decadron for possible edema
   and appropriate blood pressure control. The family was
   made aware, and after an extensive family meetings it was
   decided to make the patient CMO.



DISCHARGE STATUS:  She passed away comfortably on a morphine
drip on [**2150-6-2**].
