suicide attempt by trying to crash her car yesterday. This

unremarkable. EKG reportedly unremarkable. Evaluated by
toxicology service; recommended supportive care, q6 hour EKG
(next due at 2200). Received IVF (currently 3 liter). On
transfer to MICU, afebrile, 69, 115/62, 8, 100% NC 2L.

.
CXR ([**2144-6-9**]): UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The heart size is
normal. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
Except for mild bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis, the lungs
are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or
pneumothorax is visualized. Pulmonary vascularity is normal.
Multiple clips in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen denote
prior cholecystectomy. Dextroscoliosis of the thoracic spine is
present.
IMPRESSION: Bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis.
.
CXR [**6-10**]
Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2144-6-9**].
.
There is a linear opacity below the left hemidiaphragm that
could potentially
represent free intraperitoneal air, but these findings were not
redemonstrated
on the dedicated decubitus view, thus unlikely to represent true
pathology.
.
Compared to the prior study, there is no interval development of

consolidations worrisome for infectious process.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette including dextroscoliosis is
unchanged.
.
LAT DECUB [**6-10**]

Lateral decubitus was obtained.

There is no evidence of free air within the limitations of this
study seen.
There is minimal degree of left pleural effusion. There is
otherwise no
change since the prior study demonstrated.
.
[**6-11**]
.
Comparison is made to prior study performed a day earlier.
.
Right upper lobe opacity is either new or more conspicuous than
on prior
studies and is consistent with infectious process/pneumonia.
Bilateral
pleural effusions are small.
Bibasilar opacities could be atelectasis. There is no evident
pneumothorax.
The aorta is tortuous.
.
Cardiac size is mildly enlarged.
.
IMPRESSION: Right upper lobe pneumonia.
.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.



Brief Hospital Course:
57F depression, prior psychosis, prior suicidal attempts,
diabetes mellitus type II, admitted following suicide attempt.
.
#. Suicide attempt: Reports ingesting large quantity of
gabapentin, in addition to smaller quantities of methadone and
trazadone. Toxicology screen also positive for cocaine.
Gabapentin toxicity manifests largely as somnolence; patient
very somnolent in ED, and intermittently in ICU, where she was
transferred for somnolence and hypotension.  ECG and tele WNL
throughout the admission.  Toxicology service consulted and
recommended serial ECGs and supportive care.  Psychiatry
consulted, recommended 1:1 sitter which was continued throughout
the admission.  Mental status improved throughout the admission
and pt denied suicidal ideation.  She was given olanzapine and
ativan for agitation, with some effect.  Pt had some continued
episodes of agitation and paranoia, was evaluated for psych
placement.  After being seen by psychiatry they recommended an
inpatient psychiatry placement and underwent a bed search with
the BEST team, after a bed became available was transferred for
further care.
.
#. Prior alcohol abuse: Patient reports being free of alcohol
for 3 years; relapsed yesterday.  Was given banana bag followed
by initiation of MVI, folate, however tox screen negative for
EtOH.  Given low likelihood for alcohol withdrawal and so as to
not cloud recovery from above ingestions, no CIWA scale was
initiated.
.
#. Acute kidney injury: presumed to be pre-renal in setting of
somnolence and poor PO intake, improved with fluids.
.
#. Diabetes mellitus, type II: Currently insulin-dependent.  Her
evening dose of lantus was decreased to 20 units, which she
tolerated well with glucose ranging 80s-100s.  QACHS blood
glucose checks, coverage with Humalog sliding scale as per her
home regimen.
.
#. Productive cough: No evidence of infiltrate while in the ICU,
however pt had upper lobe infiltrate while on the floor, and
therefore was started on a course of levofloxicin, to be
continued
