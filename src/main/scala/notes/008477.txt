History of Present Illness:
60 M with a history of Hepatitis C, HIV (last CD4 of 137 on
[**2166-3-18**]) brought to the ED by his friends after the patient had
been complaining of generalized malaise and cough x 1 week, as
well as diffuse joint pains. He initially denied having a cough,
but then stated it had been on-going for a week. On ROS, the
patient denied any fevers, chills, chest pain, abdominal pain,
nausea or vomiting, back pain, dysuria, dysphagia, or
odynophagia. He denied pain around the tunneled catheter HD
line, denied recent Tylenol use, or accidental ingestions.
.
Of note, the patient was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-25**].
At that time, the patient was admitted with acute on chronic
renal insufficiency, started on hemodialysis which was continued
as an outpatient, and was diagnosed with a RML/RLL PNA and
completed a course of CTX/Azithromycin. The patient's HAART
therapy had been held earlier in [**Month (only) 956**] due to concern
regarding potential medication related ARF, and has been on hold
since. The patient's renal function progressively declined and
HD was started on [**3-20**].
.
In the ED the patient's initial V/S were: 97.5, 117/71, 80, 98%
RA. However, while still in the ED, the patient was found to be
transiently hypotensive to 79/50, HR 80, T 98.9, and still
satting 99% on RA. He was given 1L IVF with improvement in his
BP to 106/63. Given concern for PNA with a leukocytosis and
symptoms of a productive cough, and rhonchi noted on exam, the
patient was given CTX and azithro for a possible CAP. However,
Abx coverage was broadened to include Vanco and Flagyl for a
possible biliary source of infection after the patient was found
to also have a new transaminitis. He underwent an CT abd/pel
which showed fluid filled loops of colon and an atrophic left
kidney but no intrabiliary pathology.


Past Medical History:
1) HIV dx in [**2153**]. Most recent CL [**2166-2-6**] nondetectable, with

.
CXR PA and Lat [**3-31**]: Interval improvement in multifocal right
lung patchy opacities which could represent a resolving
infectious process.
.
CT A/P [**3-31**]: 1. Limited non-contrast evaluation of the hepatic
parenchyma is unremarkable without evidence of significant
intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. The CBD measures up to 1
cm, within limits in setting of cholcystectomy. 2. There are
diffusely prominent fluid-filled loops of bowel without evidence
of mechanical obstruction. [**Month (only) 116**] represent an infectious process.
.
CT head (non-contrast) [**4-2**]: 1. No evidence of space-occupying
lesion within the brain. 2. Fluid opacification of the maxillary
sinuses bilaterally, right greater than left. Aerosolized
secretions in the right maxillary sinus could suggest a
component of acute sinusitis. 3. Calcifications in the right
globe. Correlate clinically, with history of
prior trauma or infection, particularly cytomegalovirus
infection given the patient's HIV status.
.
CSF [**4-6**]: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS. Many lymphocytes, some
with reactive changes, monocytes and macrophages. Note: If
clinically suspicious for a lymphoproliferative process,
additional sampling for flow cytometry is suggested.
.
CT chest (non-contrast) [**4-8**]: 1. Extensive centrilobular and
panlobular emphysema.
2. Nodular peripheral parenchymal lesion in the right lower
lobe, accompanied by a satellite lesion, parenchymal
consolidation and a moderate pleural effusion. This lesion is
suggestive of recent infection, most likely fungal or bacterial.

3. Disseminated subpleural nodules that are most likely
post-infectious in
origin. These nodules predominate in the right lung.
4. Right lung predominant bronchiolar nodules of varying
density, suggesting recurrent bronchiolar infection.
5. Tracheal widening with tracheal sputum level.
6. Moderately enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.
7. Partial fissural distortions caused by scarring.
.
Bone Marrow [**4-9**]:
Pathology - Hypercellular bone marrow with megakaryocytic
hyperplasia
