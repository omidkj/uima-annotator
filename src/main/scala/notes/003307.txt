History of Present Illness:
74 yr old male with hx of metastatic lung cancer, prostate
cancer, transitional cell ca of the bladder, recent MRSA
pneumonia (completed Vanco course [**7-12**]), recent pseudomonas
pneumonia (on Zosyn since [**7-8**]) noted to be lethargic at his
nursing home with a RR 10. Per nursing home staff no recent
worsening in cough, fevers, complaints of chest pain or
shortness of breath. After several failed attempts at
intubation, an ABG was checked and pCO2 was found to be 115. Pt
was then brought to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with a laryngeal mask airway and
then successfully intubated by anesthesia. An ABG on the
ventilator was 7.32/57/241. In the ED, T 97, HR 86, bp 117/68,
resp 18, 100%. CXR showed new patchy right-sided infiltrates and
he received vancomycin 1 g IV X 1 and ceftazidime 1 g IV X 1 and
1.7 L of fluid. Patient then dropped his sbp to 60s and HR to
the 40s, for which he received 1 mg of atropine and was started
on a lephed gtt with recovery of his HR to 80s and sbp 130s.
Currently unable to obtain further information from patient as
he is intubated and sedated.

CTA:
1. No evidence for pulmonary embolism.
2. Interval opacification of the lung parenchyma within the left
hemithorax with minimal aeration of the left upper lung lobe
consistent with pneumonia. Interval worsening of the patchy
airspace opacities within the right lower, middle, and upper
lung lobes also consistent with pneumonia. Interval increase in
size of large right pleural effusion.
3. Unchanged bony lesions.
.
CT Head:
 No evidence of hemorrhage, mass effect, or major vascular
territorial infarction.
.
CXR:
Persistent near complete opacification of the left lung. New,
multifocal patchy opacities within the right lung which may
represent infiltrate or CHF.
.
Upper ext doppler:
New non-occlusive thrombus within the left subclavian vein.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was intubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure.  After a
meeting with the pt's daughter, his health care proxy, the
decision was made, by both the pt and his daughter, to extubate
the pt and make him CMO.  The pt was extubated one day after
admission and he expired the following day.  His daughter was at
his bedside.  The following is a description of his brief
hospital course.
.
1) Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Pt intubated on arrival to
ED.  Respiratory failure likely [**2-16**] COPD exacerbation
superimposed on persistent/recurrent pneumonia, possibly
post-obstructive.  CTA in ED was negative for PE.  CXR showed
near complete opacification of the left lung along with new
opacities in the right lung.  He was given Vancomycin, cefepime
and flagyl for post-obstructive/aspiration pneumonia and
solumedrol with nebs for COPD.  Sputum cx grew pseudomonas.  As
above, pt was extubated after a family meeting and made CMO.
.
2) Hypotension: Briefly, around time of intubation, due to
propofol.  Resolved.
.
3) Hypernatremia: Likely [**2-16**] decreased access to free water so
pt was given free water boluses down NGT.
.
4) Coagulopathy: INR 1.4, likely represents nutritional
deficiency so pt was given Vitamin K.
.
5) h/o CAD: recent NSTEMI with current nonspecific ST-T wave
changes.  Pt was continued on cardiac meds.
.
6) LUE edema: Left upper ext ultrasound showed new subclavian
clot.
