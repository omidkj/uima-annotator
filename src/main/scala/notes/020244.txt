Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2234**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation with successful extubation


History of Present Illness:
67 yo F w/ recent CABG c/b ARF req. HD (3 wks prior), DMII, CVA,
HTN, PVD, ESRD presents from NH w/ resp. distress, tachypnea.
She was given 40 IV lasix enroute to the ED. Per her daughters,
she had been conversant and feeling relatively well up until
yesterday but then began to act confused over the course of the
day and eventually became incoherent.

In the ED the pt. was noted to be tachypneic with diffuse
crackles on exam. Initial vitals notable for a fever of 102.8. A
CXR showed finding c/w pulm edema (although consolidation could
not be r/o). She was started on a nitro GTT and BIPAP was
initiated as daughters would not allow intubation. Per report,
tachypnea improved with BIPAP. Additionally, pt. was given a
dose of levoflox/vanco in the ED for empiric pna coverage. Also,
on presentation pt had a BG of 500 and was given 10u of insulin.
Her K was 6.4 for which she was given. Also, there was a
question of inferior ischemic changes on ECG (?mild STE in the
inferior leads). CE were sent, blood cx, urine cx sent and pt.
was transported to the MICU.

On arrival to the MICU, confused, aggitated, tachypneic, not
tolerating BIPAP. Pt intubated for airway protection and art
line placed.  While in the MICU, she was treated for pneumonia
with Vanc/Cefepime for 9 days and antibiotics were discontinued
the day of transfer to the floor.  Since then intermittently
looked better, but then intermittently aspirates with acute
respiratory decompensation. Had NSTEMI upon arrival to ICU and
was treated appropriately with  heparin gtt for 48hrs.  Renal
was also consulted and had been following for acute on chronic
renal insufficiency.  She hasn't needed HD in awhile.   She
additionally has a history of old stroke, not new here.  Also
has a hx of arterial clot after Ao-Fem bypass, but does not to
need to be on coumadin anymore as per her vascular doctor.  Last
respiratory decompensation was [**2154-2-18**] at 1am, that resolved with
agressive suctioning, lasix IV and brief treatment with nitro
gtt.  She has recalcitrant BP's and the ICU team has been
titrating BP meds.  Upon transfer she is on Labetalol 600 TID,
Imdur TID, Captopril TID, but still intermittently 170's.  Major
issue now is aspiration and swallowing: repeat swallow study
today with appropriate diet modifications. PEG in place and
getting TFs.

Upon transfer to the floor, she is pleasant, denies any
difficulty breathing or pain.  She is oriented to person and
place.  Denies any recent fever, chills or other complaints.

CXR, SINGLE VIEW CHEST, PORTABLE UPRIGHT [**2154-2-11**]: There has been
interval development of increased interstitial and alveolar
opacities within the lungs. The patient is status post median
sternotomy and CABG. Percutaneous gastric tube and surgical
clips seen within the abdomen. IMPRESSION: Interval development
of diffuse interstitial and alveolar opacities most consistent
with pulmonary edema. However, multifocal pnemonia should also
be considered and follow-up films after treatment will be of
benefit.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2154-2-11**] 11:48 PM
No significant change from [**2154-1-5**].  Chronic ischemic changes
with no evidence of hemorrhage or recent infarction.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2154-2-13**] 5:01 AM
No significant interval change without evidence for acute
intracranial hemorrhage.

RENAL U.S. Study Date of [**2154-2-18**] 2:02 PM
1.  Due to the patient's inability to hold breath, the Doppler
study could not be performed, and therefore, renal artery
stenosis could not be assessed.
2.  7-mm nonobstructing stone in the right kidney.  5-mm stone
versus vascular calcifications in the left kidney.
3.  1.9-cm cyst in the left kidney.

VIDEO OROPHARYNGEAL SWA Study Date of [**2154-2-19**] 1:09 PM
1.  Aspiration of thin & nectar thick liquids during swallows
with straws.
2.  Suggestion of impaired or increased vocal fold abduction or
closure.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 yo F with recent STEMI status post 3 vessel CABG complicated
by ARF/HD, DM II, HTN, history of CVA, admitted from
rehabilitation facility with respiratory distress and mental
status changes.

# Respiratory failure: This was her admitting diagnosis.  She
was intubated for airway protection given altered mental status
on CPAP. CXR consistent with pulmonary edema but given fever
could also have PNA vs flu. Hypertensive prior to intubation
which could have exacerbated pulmonary edema but post-intubation
she became normotensive. While in the ICU was treated
presumptively for hospital acquired pneumonia with vanc/cefepime
for a 9 day course.  Successfully extubated without need for
reintubation.  Continued to have intermittent respiratory
distress that was attributed to aspiration events.  Not clearly
assessed for PE, given that she was receiving heparin at her
rehab. Lower extremity Dopplers were also obtained given concern
for PE, though this was low on differential.  Doppler exam was
negative for thrombus. Upon transfer to the floor is doing well
on RA with intermittent nebs for increased SOB.  Continued to
monitor for evidence of infection, and she had no further
evidence of this.  Continued with Nebulizers PRN and aspiration
precautions.  Lastly, she was started on steroids [**2-18**] AM for
acute respiratory distress, despite lack of evidence for asthma
vs COPD flair.  Respirator
