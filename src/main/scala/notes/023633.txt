Reason: eval post op

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
60 year old woman s/p AVR/MVR/Exlap
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval post op
INDICATION: 60-year-old woman status post AVR/MVR.

COMPARISON: [**2180-10-15**].

FINDINGS: Since prior examination, there has been interval
improvement in the aeration in both lungs. The Swan-Ganz
catheter has been removed. The lungs are clear aside for left
lower lobe atelectasis. Bilateral small pleural effusions. The
cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are unchanged. No
evidence of pneumothorax. Stable appearance of the sternotomy
wires.

IMPRESSION: Interval improvement in the aeration, bilaterally.
Minimal left lower lobe atelectasis with small bilateral pleural
effusions. Interval removal of the Swan-Ganz catheter.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results
were personally
post-bypass
data

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed
(<0.2m/s). A
patent foramen ovale was suspected, but a saline bubble study
was done at rest
and with valsalva with no flow across the septum.
2. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed. [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular

regurgitation.]
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is
seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
The mitral valve
shows characteristic rheumatic deformity. There is severe mitral
stenosis.
Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
6. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS 1: Pt is being AV paced and is receiving an infusion
of
phenylephrine
1. A mechanical valve is well seated in the mitral position,
trace wash in
jets are seen. A mean gradient of 5 mm of Hg is noted across the
valve. Both
leaflets appear to be moving well.
2. A mechanical valve is well seated in the aortic position,
trace wash in
jets are seen. A mean gradient of 6 mm of Hg is noted across the
valve. Both
leaflets appear to be moving well.
3. RV systolic function is preserved and LV systolic function is
improved.

Severe RV dysfunction with moderate Inferior and infero-septal
dysfunction iis
noted with hemodynamic changes. CPB reinitiated to support
circulation.

POST- BYPASS 2: Pt is being AV paced and is receiving an
infusion of
Phenylephrine, Norepinephrine and Epinephrine
1. RV function is mildly depressed, and Inferior and
inferoseptal LV is back
to baseline
2. Valve function appears normal

Severe RV dysfunction with mild inferior and infero-septal
dysfunction was
noted after chest closure.

POST- IABP:
1. IABP noted in the descending thoracic aorta below take off of
Lt subclavian
artery
2. RV function is mildly depressed and inferior and infero
septal wall in back
to baseline
3. Other findings are unchanged
4. All findings discussed with surgeons at the time of the
exams.

[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 34290**] was admitted preoperatively for heparin.  On
[**2180-10-10**], Dr [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] performed mitral valve
replacement and aortic valve replacement.  For further surgical
details, please see separate
dictated operative note. Following the operation, she was
brought
to the CSRU for invasive monitoring with an intra aortic balloon
pump. Was supported on pressors (Epinephrine and Neosynephrine,
then vasopressin) and inotrope (Milirone).  Remained intubated
and sedated due to increasing lactate level and surgery was
consulted, stress steroids started. Limited abdominal ultrasound
indicated portal vein open.  Under went exploratory laparotomy
with normal abdominal structures and no evidence of ischemia.
POD 1 lactate decreasing, remained intubated with sedation due
to metabolic acidosis.  Epinephrine weaned off, steroid taper
started, continued with Vasopressin, Neosynephrine, and Milirone
with intra aortic balloon pump 1:1.  POD 2 IABP weaned and
removed, lactate nl, Chest tube removal.  POD 3 continued to
wean pressors, inotropes, and sedation.  Then POD 4 was
extubated and was neurologically intact, milirone and sedation
weaned off but continued with vasopressin.  Lasix drip started.
POD 5 all drips weaned off and coumadin started, remained in
CSRU for close monitoring and then POD 7 transfered to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2
and continued to progress.  Underwent cardioversion on POD 9 for
atrial fibrilla
