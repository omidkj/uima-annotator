SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with
suspected cholecystitis, evaluated by Surgery initially, and
admitted to the Medicine Service for intravenous antibiotics.

PROBLEM #1:  Cholecystitis.  The patient was initially
admitted to the Medicine Service and evaluated by Surgery who
felt that surgical intervention for her suspected
cholecystitis was risky given all her underlying medical
issues.

The patient developed DIC with a rising INR, decrease in
platelet count.  Surgery recommended percutaneous drainage of
the gallbladder and she was transferred to the Intensive Care
Unit for placement of the percutaneous drain.

The patient had been developing worsening respiratory
distress over the previous two days and required intubation
prior to percutaneous drain placement.  She also received
fresh frozen plasma in cryoprecipitate.  The patient's
gallbladder was drained successfully at the bedside by
Interventional Radiology with initial defervescence of her
fever.

PROBLEM #2:  Adult respiratory distress syndrome.  The
patient developed severe adult respiratory distress syndrome
immediately preceding percutaneous drainage.  She was placed
on mechanical ventilation requiring pressure control
ventilation, paralytics and sedation to adequately ventilate
her.  Etiology of her adult respiratory distress syndrome was
unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] ventilatory status improved gradually on broad
spectrum antibiotics.

PROBLEM #3:  DIC:  The patient then developed fulmanant DIC
on admission to the hospital with a rise in INR, dropping
platelet counts.  She had no evidence of clotting.  The
patient was started on ....... transiently, but because of
rising INR and dropping platelet count, the ........ was
discontinued.

PROBLEM #4:  Renal.  The patient's urine output gradually
declined and she became more hypotensive requiring
vasopressors.  The patient was followed by the Renal Consult
Service.

PROBLEM #5:  Fungemia.  The patient developed blood cultures
positive for [**Female First Name (un) **] after seven to eight days of broad
spectrum antibiotics and TPN.  The patient became febrile and
rapidly became hemodynamically unstable requiring multiple
pressors.  Her clinical status continued to decline.  The
patient was placed on four pressors, Dopamine, Levophed and
Neo-Synephrine, but continued to develop worsening lactic
acidosis and increasing hemodynamic instability.  She was
given a bicarbonate drip and calcium gluconate but continued
to worsen.

The patient's family was at the bedside.  She developed PA
rest.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Cholecystitis.
2.  DIC.
3.  Fungemia.
4.  Adult respiratory distress syndrome.
5.  Acute renal failure.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Dead.
