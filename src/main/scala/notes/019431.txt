History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2455**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old male with history of severe aortic
stenosis s/p valvuloplasty x 2 (most recently [**4-/2126**]),
hypertension, dyslipidemia and CAD S/P CABG (LIMA-LAD, SVG-OM,
SVG-PDA in [**2114**]) and recent NSTEMI here for an elective
admission for CoreValve placement.
.
He was admitted in [**2126-12-4**] for fatigue and ARF that was
found to be secondary to urinary obstruction and UTI. In late
Januray, he was re-admitted to progressive weakness and fatigue
and was again treated for a UTI. The patient has been following
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 986**] since then, and has been using a chronic
foley at home. Since discharge, he continues to have chest pain
with exertion, which is relieved after he sits down and rests.
He continues to be easily fatigued. He has had multiple prior
admissions for CP secondary to his AS.

2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM:
[**12/2126**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional
left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is critical aortic
valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with normal regional and global
systolic function. Mildly dilated and hypokinetic right
ventricle with moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Critical calcific aortic stenosis with mild aortic
regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation - regurgitation
begins in very late diastole due to long PR interval. Mitral
inflow demonstrates that E and A waves are separated from each
other, in spite of the long PR. This is due to the patient's
resting bradycardia.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-4-12**], LV
systolic function is low-normal, the right ventricle appears
mildly dilated/hypokinetic and pulmonary artery systolic
pressures are higher.

COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system
demonstrated
severe native LMCa and three vessel disease. The LMCA was
heavily
calcified and occluded in its middle portion. The LAD and LCx
were not visualized due to LMCA occlusion, but were heavily
calcified. The RCA was heavily calcified and had a 75% proximal
stenosis, a 50% mid-vessel stenosis and was functionaly occluded
after the acute marginal branches and again ditallyl prior to
the RPDA. At least 1 acute marginal branch was subtotaly
occluded.
2. Graft angiography revealed a patent SVG-OM onto a large
branching
OM. There was severe disease in the retrogradely filled proximal
portion of the grafted OM filing back into the AV groove CX and
an earlier smaller lower pole of the grafted OM. The SVG-PDA had
mild plaquing and was patent onto the mid RPDA with retrograde
filling of RPL1 and RPL2, with collaterals to the distal AV
groove CX via the distal AV groove RCA. There were a few septal
collaterals to the mid LAD and apical collaterals to a smaller
higher OM. There was severe disease in the retrogradely filled
distal AV groove RCA proximal/cephelad to the RPDA.  The
LIMA-LAD had a mild origin plaque and was patent onto the mid
LAD with retrograde filling to a diagonal. There were septal and
apical
collaterals to several lower posterolateral branches (probably
LPL).
3. Resting hemodynamcis revealed mildly elevated right- and
left-sided filling pressures, with an RVEDP of 12 mm Hg and a
PCWP of 18 mm Hg. There was moderate to severe pulmonary
arterial systolic hypertension, with a PASP of 60 mm Hg. The
cardiac index was depressed at 2.1 L/min/m2 (using an ass
