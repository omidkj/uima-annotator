Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Sepsis, respiratory distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
65F w/ h/o metastatic breast cancer to breast and lungs
currently receiving CMT (cycle 1, day 19), brought to the ED by
rehab for abnormal labs. She was found to be neutropenic, anemia
and thrombocytopenic. At the rehab, vitals were reportedly T
100.4, HR 107, BP 92/42. There is also a concern for possible
confusion and urine incontinence. Per patient, she is has not
experienced any confusion, and was refusing to cooperate for the
last few days because she was angry that her physicians have not
been forthcoming with her prognosis. She is usually incontinent
of bowel and bladder, and denies diarrhea, abdominal pain,
brbpr, melena, dysuria, or hematuria. She has not felt any
fevers or chills and has otherwise been feeling fine and had
been expecting to be discharged from rehab on Sunday. She denies
cough, SOB, chest pain, headache, photophobia, neck stiffness.
She has a left port which is not painful and is used for
chemotherapy.

Of note, she was recently admitted in [**Month (only) **] for frequent falls,
which were initially believed to be due to seizures, however,
EEGs were negative. She was diagnosed with orthostasis/autonomic
dysfunction and deconditioning and discharged to rehab.

ED course: T 100.6, EKG NSR at 83 w/ TWF, received vancomycin,
cefepime and IVF. CT head was negative for an acute process.

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGY HISTORY:
[**2108**]: Stage II right sided, invasive ductal adenocarcinoma,
ER-/Her2+ on initial core biopsy (done [**2108-1-17**]), but
ER-/HER2NEGATIVE on the excised breast specimen done [**2108-2-17**]
(please see below). She underwent 4 cycles of adriamycin and
cyclophosphamide followed by radiation therapy, completed in
[**2108**].
[**2119-1-20**]: Presented with ear complaints and nasal congestion,
initially thought to be related to swimmer's ear. She was given
a
course of antibiotics and nasal sprays with no resolution.
Symptoms evolved to include pain with mouth opening and
ultimately jaw restriction; right jaw area seemed swollen. CT
sinus/mandible scan on [**2119-1-26**] showed an irregular lucency in the
right mandibular ramus. [**2119-2-10**] biopsy by FNA showed groups of
atypical epithelial cells consistent with poorly-differentiated
carcinoma. A PET scan on [**2119-2-10**] showed a left lower lobe lung
mass, a left pleural lesion, a dome of the liver lesion and the
right mandibular ramus. On [**2119-2-13**], the left lung lesion was
biopsied and showed adenocarcinoma with immunostaining positive
for Cytokeratin 7 in the tumor cells, but negative for
cytokeratin 20, CDX-2, TTF-1, Mammoglobin, GCDFP, ER and PR
immunostains. HER2 amplification was not found. Because the
TTF-1
immunostain is negative, a lung primary is thought to be
unlikely. She is also followed by an ENT physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**First Name (STitle) **]
[**Name (STitle) **]. Her recent chemotherapy treatment history follows:

METASTATIC CANCER TREATMENT HX
FIRST LINE THERAPY:
[**2119-2-20**]: Started on trial 09-312; This is a Phase 3 Randomized
Study of Gemcitabine and Carboplatin with or without BSI201 in
patients with triple negative metastatic breast cancer.  [**Male First Name (un) **]
was randomized to Arm B: Gemcitabine, Carboplatin, and BSI201;
[**2119-3-10**] - Cycle 1 D1
Completed 9 cycles, stopped due to progression; Patient did have
treatment delays and dose reductions due to
thrombocytopenia-ENDED [**2119-10-20**]
SECOND LINE THERAPY:
Paclitaxel 80mg/m2 weekly, 3 week on/1 week off.
[**2119-11-10**] - [**2120-7-15**] - received approximately 9 cycles, needed
Neupogen support with 3rd cycle for neutropenia. Stopped due to
progression seen in by new liver and brain mets.

Now she also received radiation therapy.


Social History:
Works as a nurse/community liason for a company. With long time
partner [**Name (NI) **],no children.

Brief Hospital Course:
65F w/ h/o metastatic breast cancer to brain & lungs presenting
with neutropenic fever, anemia and thrombocytopenia.
.
# Neutropenic fever: admitted for febrile neutropenia (temp
100.6 in ED, ANC 38).  denied all symptoms including subjective
fevers. started empirically on vanc/cefepime and pancultured but
no obvious source for infection was found, cultures were neg,
and CXR negative initially.  On the evening of hospital day 3 pt
began to desat to the 80s but improved with oxygen via nasal
cannula.  The next morning, pt desatted again to the 80s and was
less responsive to oxygen, but O2 sats improved after nebs and
lasix.  CXR showed new area suspicious for pneumonia so coverage
broadened to vanc/zosyn to cover anaerobes.  ANC was much
improved at that time (up to 2139 from 216 the day prior) so her
poor saturation was thought to be secondary to mounted immune
response to pneumonia that was present.  The following day she
desatted to 70s and became tachycardic to 140s.  She continued
to desat after receiving nebs and was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
# Respiratory Distress:
While in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patients antibiotic coverage was
adjusted.  She expressed wishes to change her code status to
full code.  She continued to retain CO2 and her respirations
became more labored.  The possibility of intubation was again
discussed with the patient and she reported that she did not
want to be intubated.  This was confirmed with her health care
proxy.  The following morning, the patient continued to have
difficulty breathing and was increasingly altered mental status.
 The decision to change her care to comfort was made following
discussions with her health care proxy.  She passed away
peacefully in the presence of friends the following day.

# Anemia: Thought to be secondary to chemotherapy.  Hct was 21.5
upon admission but decreased to 20.1 during course of admission,
prompting transfusion of 1 unit PRBC.  Hct improved
appropriately after this.

# Metastatic breast cancer to liver, lungs, brain: pt was
undergoing chemo at the time of admission.  She was continued on
seizure prophylaxis and valproic acid.

# Falls: Pt has a history of falls with negative neurologic work
up.  Thought to be multifactorial, [**2-21**] possible seizures,
deconditioning, and orthostasis/autonomic dysfunction.  She was
continued on fludrocortisone and seizure prophylaxis and this
was not an active issue.
