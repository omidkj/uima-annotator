History of Present Illness:
83 year-old female with history of breast cancer,
bronchoalveolar lung cancer with known brain metastesis.  She
presents from home after an unwitnessed fall. The patient was
taking a nap sitting up in a chair at home leaning forward on
her table. She fell off of her chair towards the right. Her

month where she is dependent on her family for help transferring
to her wheelchair. She is on a decadron taper for her brain
metastases, and has had severe muscle atrophy. She does not c/o
of any changes in her bowel movements or urination. She does
have a feeling of a "tickle" in her throat with a cough, but no
hemoptysis.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 year old female with breast and lung cancer admitted status
post unwitnessed fall who was found to have bilateral pulmonary
emboli.
.
1. Bilateral Pulmonary Emboli: When she was in the emergency
room, she was hypoxic and required supplemental oxygen.  Given
her history of malignancy, a CT scan was done which showed
bilateral Pulmonary Emboli.  Initially, she was not started on
heparin for anticoagulation given that she had known brain
metastasis.  However, on hospital day 3, she developed a
supraventricular tachycardia (see below) to the 170s.  It was
felt that the SVT may be secondary to right heart strain.
Therefore, she was started on heparin as a bridge to Coumadin.
She was started on 5mg of Coumadin daily.  Since she became
therapeutic after 2 doses, her coumadin dose was decreased to
2.5mg daily.  On discharge, her INR was 2.7.
.
2. Deep venous thrombosis: She was found to have a partially
occlusive thrombus in her left popliteal vein.  Since she was
initially not anticoagulated, an IVC filter was placed to
decreased her risk of future pulmonary emboli.
.
3. Supraventricular tachycardia:  On hospital day 3, she
developed SVT with a rate in the 170s.  Carotid massage
converted her to normal sinus rhythm transiently for about 15
minutes.  Given her low blood pressure 70s systolic and
increased oxygen requirement, she was transferred to the
intensive care unit for DC cardioversion.  She received fentanyl
and midazolam for sedation.  She received a total of one shock
at 100J with immediate conversion to sinus rhythm.  An EKG post
cardioversion did not show any ischemic changes.  She was loaded
with 150 mg IV amiodarone and maintained on a infusion of 0.5
mg/min for 24 hours.  She was then transitioned to a oral
amiodarone load of 400 mg twice a day.  Within 48 hours of
cardioversion, she went into SVT again, but she was converted to
sinus rhythm with carotid massage.  She remained in normal sinus
rhythm for the remainder of her hospital stay.  After 7 days of
the oral amiodarone load at 400 mg [**Hospital1 **], she should be tapered to
200 [**Hospital1 **] for 2 weeks and then maintained at 200 mg  daily.  Her
atenolol, which was started for SVT, was held since she was
started on amiodarone.
.
4. Brain metastasis: Her Decadron was maintained at 2 mg orally
twice a day given.
.
5. Hypertension: Her blood pressure remained low between 90-110s
systolic during her hospital stay.  Her atenolol was held given
that she was not hypertensive.
.
6. Urinary tract infection: She was found to have a
pan-sensitive e.coli in her urine.  She completed a 3-day course
of levofloxacin.
.
7. She was maintained on a regular diet.  Initially, she had a
decreased appetite.  She was given maintenance IV fluids while
she had a low oral intake.  Her electrolytes were repleted.
.
8. Access: She had peripheral IVs.
.
9. Prophylaxis: She had heparin and Coumadin, a PPI, and a bowel
regimen.
.
10. Code: Initially, she was full code.  However, she expressed
her desire to be made comfortable.  After discussion with her
family and herself, she was made DNR/DNI.
.
11. Dispo: She was discharged to rehab once she was therapeutic
on her Coumadin.
