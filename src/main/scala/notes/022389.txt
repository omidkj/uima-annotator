Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
left/right heart catherization

History of Present Illness:
82 yo M w/ PMHx of DM w/ peripheral neuropathy, HTN, HL, CHF (EF
~30%) s/p ICD, OSA, CKD, gout and CAD who presented to the ED
with chest pain at rest and tachycardia to 140s. Approximately
at 8:30 PM on the evening of presentation, he developed gradual
onset of achy chest pain associated with diaphoresis. He denied
palpitations, SOB. EMS was called and enroute he received SL
nitroglycerin without improvement in chest pain and induction of
hypotension.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 96.7 156 123/87 16 99%RA. He was
noted to have signficant ST depressions with tachycardia and
without tachycadia. Troponin trended up to 0.18 and CK to 404
and echo done in ED by the fellow showed no segmental wall
motion abnormalities, but EF decreased from prior at 15-20%.
Integrellin gtt, heparin gtt, asa 325mg , plavix 600mg were
initiated and he was taken to the cath lab.
.
In the cath lab, he received 60mg IV lasix and heparin was
discontinued. He received 25mcg fentanyl, 0.5mg versed, 185cc
contrast, and 200cc NSb during the procedure. A swan was placed
which induced ectopy and broke the SVT. LCx had 90% ISR and pt
received PCI w/ a DES. He was noted to be presistently
hypotensive (SBP 80-90s) and a balloon pump was placed prior to
admission to the CCU.
.
In the CCU, he was chest pain free and his only complaint was
his chronic neck and back pain.
.
On review of systems, he reports recent rhinnitis and
non-productive cough not associated with fevers or chills. He
denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of dyspnea on
exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

EKG [**11-23**]: Probable atrial tachycardia with variable block.
Borderline intraventricular
conduction delay. Inferior lead QRS configuration raises
consideration of
prior inferior myocardial infarction, although it is
non-diagnostic. Delayed
R wave progression with late precordial QRS transition. ST-T
wave
abnormalities. Findings are non-specific. Clinical correlation
is suggested.
Since the previous tracing of the same date ventricular response
is now
irregular and slower, precordial lead QRS configuration shows
delayed R wave progression but is less suggestive of anterior
myocardial infarction and further precordial lead ST-T wave
changes are present.
.
TTE [**11-24**]: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the
inferior and inferolateral walls, hypokinesis of the anterior
wall and septum. The lateral wall has relatively preserved
function. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %). with borderline normal free wall
function. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. A bioprosthetic
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The prosthetic aortic valve
leaflets are thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
