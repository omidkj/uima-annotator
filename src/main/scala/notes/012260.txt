History of Present Illness:
62 y.o. male with pmh significant for stroke at age 11, with
subsequent right sided hemiparesis and seizure disorder,
presenting today after being found down in the mail room of his
apartment building. The patient reports he was checking his mail
when he suddenly lost consciousness and dropped to the ground.
The patient does not know how long he was on the ground for, but
he does remember anticipating that he was about to fall. Patient
does not report loss of bladder or bowel continence, but does
report feeling confused after he regained consciousness. In
fact, at the time of this interview, 6 hours after presentation
to the ED, the patient still reports confusion and believes his
memory is worse since the incident. The patient denies chest
pain, shortness of breath, fever, headaches, abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting, diahrrea, constipation melena. Patient reports
right sided weakness, right sided diminished sensation,
diminished appetite with recent 10lb weight loss, feeling of
fatigue, just feeling "not well".
.
On presentation to the ED, Vitals were BP 200/90, HR 126. EKG
was NSR with no signs of arrythmia or ischemia, Dilantin level
was low at 6.9. Patient was administered Dilantin 500mg PO. Head
CT was negative for acute intracranial bleed.
.
On the floor, he was found to be unresponsive with tonic-clonic
movements by nursing. Code Blue called. Seizure broke
spontaneously and pt was confused but responsive to simple
verbal commands. Transferred to MICU for Q1H neuro checks.

When deemed stable, the patient was transferred to the floor for
further management.

[**2161-8-4**]: Dilantin Level: 16.3

[**2161-8-5**] CTA head:
IMPRESSION:
1.  There has been no significant interval change of the
aneurysm involving
the left superior cerebellar artery and left internal carotid
artery proximal
to the bifurcation.
2.  There are no new aneurysms identified.
3.  There is no evidence of hemorrhage.


Brief Hospital Course:
62 y.o. male with history of juvenile stroke and resulting right
sided hemiparesis, currently followed by neurology for a
cerebellar aneurysm.  When the patient presented to the ED, he
had been found down with a sub-therapeutic dilantin level,
reporting that he felt similar to his previously experienced
seizure auras/post-ictal states.  He was admitted to the floor
where his nurse witnessed a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. At
that time, Neurology loaded him with dilantin (500 mg po +
1000mg iv) on [**8-1**], and dilantin maintenance was increased to
600mg qhs on, and subsequently decreased to 500mg qday on [**8-3**].
His dilantin level returned to the therapeutic range of 16.3
(from 6 on admission).  The patient remained stable in the MICU,
and was transferred to the floor on [**8-4**].  Neurology continued
to consult.  They recommended a head CT-angiogram, which showed
a stable cerebellar aneurysm, no new intracranial hemorrhages,
and no new aneurysms.  They also recommended switching to Keppra
for seizure maintenance, as the long term side effect profile of
dilantin is not desireable.  We started his keppra at 500mg [**Hospital1 **],
and he will be followed closely as this dose which will be
titrated up in conjunction with a dilantin taper.

His blood pressure was elevated both on admission, and
throughout his hospital stay in the 140-170 SBP range.  He was
started him on HCTZ at 25mg qday, and he will be followed as an
outpatient to further manage this.

His depression and anxiety were managed with his normal
outpatient regimen with the exception of stopping his wellbutrin
given the side effect of increased seizure threshold.  His COPD
was managed with prn albuterol nebulizer treatments.  We
continued aggrenox for his history of stroke.

Discharge Disposition:
Home

Discharge Diagnosis:
S/p fall, seizure, sub-therapeutic dilantin levels.

Discharge Condition:
Stable

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after you fell in your
apartment.  When you came to the hospital, you dilantin level
was too low.  Neurology changed your dilantin dose and added a
new medication for your seizures called Keppra (levitericetam).
You will need to take both of these medications as directed
until you see your neurologist in two weeks.  Over time, the
dilantin dose will slowly be decreased and be stopped, and the
keppra dose will be slowly increased and continued from now on.
Your head CT (a scan of your head) was normal.  We also started
you on a drug called hydrochlorothiazide for your blood
pressure, you will need to see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5456**
