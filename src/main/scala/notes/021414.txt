Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from [**Hospital 6136**] hospital for a portex tracheostomy.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2189-12-15**] Open tracheostomy, esophagoscopy, flexible
bronchoscopy, open gastrostomy tube.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 47 yo F smoker with hx of sleep apnea on CPAP at home,
obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and COPD who was initially
admitted to [**Hospital 77152**] hospital on [**2189-11-20**] for productive cough,
shortness of breath, and bilateral wheezing.  Pt had low grade
fevers [**2189-11-21**] and was hypoxic to 84% on RA [**2189-11-21**] which improved
to 95% on 3LNC.  She was started on levofloxacin, nebs, and
systemic steroids for treatment of COPD exacerbation with
suspected PNA.  On [**2189-11-22**] she developed worsening hypoxia
w/lethargy on CPAP 5LO2, ABG at that time was 7.27/90/31 with
bicarb 41. She was transferred to the OSH MICU and she was
intubated.  She had bronchoscopy [**11-22**] which showed secretions in
the airways BL and easily collapsible airway.  Cultures of these
washings grew MRSA.  Levofloxacin was changed to vancomycin and
systemic steroids were decreased.  She continued on the vent
with frequent episodes of coughing and ??????fighting the vent?????? with
accompanying cyanosis.  These episodes lasted ~1 minute, and
would require ambu-bag ventilation after which time it would
resolve.  She never had to be paralyzed due to these events, but
she was continued on propofol gtt.
.
On [**2189-11-26**] pt had a repeat bronch showed mild erythema of the
airways.  She was started on theophyline.
.
On [**2189-11-29**] blood cultures grew MRSA and coag negative staph.  Pt
was continued on vancomycin.
.
Mutiple attempts at weaning off the vent were attempted but were
unsuccessful, leading the team at the OSH to consider
tracheostomy.  General an thoracic surgery were consulted at the
OSH, and felt that the pt would require an extra-long
tracheostomy tube called a portex tracheostomy tube.  Despite
multiple attempts, the OSH hospital was unable to obtain such a
tube, and the pt was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for placement
evaluation and possible placement of this tracheostomy tube.
.
Because of the MRSA bacteremia, the team at the OSH had
considered echocardiogram to r/o endocarditis.  Due to the pt??????s
body habitus it was felt that she would require TEE.  However,
the pt did not have the echo before being transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Brief Hospital Course:
47 yo morbidly obese female smoker with history of sleep apnea
presented to OSH with cough and pneumonia, went on to develop
respiratory distress requiring intubation.  Despite weaning
attempts at the OSH pt has been unable to pass SBT, and came to
[**Hospital1 18**] for portex tracheostomy.
.
Acute on Chronic Resp failure:  Pt is morbidly obese, tobacco
smoker with COPD/asthma, tracheobronchomalacia, sleep apnea and
obesity hypoventilation.  On admission to OSH pt had elevated
bicarb suggesting pre-existing presence of obesity
hypoventilation syndrome.  Then she developed acute worsening of
SOB and cough likely [**12-19**] MRSA PNA and required intubation.
Before intubation ABG was performed and showed hypercapnea in
the presence of high bicarb, suggesting that chronic obesity
hypoventilation syndrome had caused CO2 retention and
compensatory metabolic acidosis before the insult of PNA.  Due
to prolonged vent requirement, Thoracics evaluated her for a
tracheostomy.  Pt was treated with bronchodilators and inhaled
steroids.  Patient was taken for trach by thoracics, with a
succesful operation.  Please see seperate op report for full
details of that procedure.  After that procedure the patient was
slowly weaned from the vent.  She   was successful on [**3-23**] hours
of trach mask trial and 1 day later she was successful on [**5-25**]
hours of trach trial.  Complicating problem of abdominal wound
dehiscence requiring ex-lap and fascial closure, for which she
required AC mode briefly, but quickly was weaned to pressure
support at her previous settings.  She was evaluated for a PM
valve but was unable to tolerate it secondary to bronchospasm.
On the day of discharge she was tolerating a trach mask very
well.
.
Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome: as described above, pt has
obesity hypoventilation syndrome causing significant CO2
retention.

.
Tracheobronchomalacia: Pt was shown to have easily collapsible
airway on bronchoscopy.  This is likely a chronic problem, but
is probably contributing to her respiratory distress.
Respiratory distress with Tracheobronchomalacia was managed as
described above.
.
Sleep Apnea: Pt has hx of severe sleep apnea.  A trachestomy was
thought to offer some relief from nighttime apnea.  Thoracics
team evaluated for tracheostomy and it was done as above.
.
COPD: Hx of asthma with smoking hx, contributing to underlying
chronic resp failure.
Pt was treated with bronchodilators and inhaled steroids as
described above.
.
MRSA Bacteremia/PNA: Pt had PNA with BAL cx showing MRSA and
subsequently had positive BCx.  Vancomycin was continued to
complete a 14 day course.  Pt did not have persistent fevers or
persistently positive Cx so it was felt that endocarditis was
unlikely and echocardiogram was therefore not obtained.
.
Diabetes Mellitus: continued Lantus 30/30 and HISS which had
been started at the OSH.  This was insufficient for control of
her elevated blood sugars, and was elevated, eventually to a
level of 60/60.  Intervally, she was on an insulin drip for
control of these elevated sugars.  She was followed by the
[**Hospital **] clinic while in the hospital and it was felt that her
elevated blood sugars were secondary to infection (UTI and
pneumonia).  On discharge she was on an insulin sliding scale
and glargine 60 [**Hospital1 **].
.
UTI: the patient developed a fever s/p trach that initially was
felt to be a ?VAP due to gram negative organisms on sputum.
However, these grew as
