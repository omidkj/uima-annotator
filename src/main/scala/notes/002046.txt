Reason: LOWER EXTREMITY EDEMA AND PAIN

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
61 year old man with L lower extremity edema and pain
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
assess for dvt
DOPPLER ULTRASOUND STUDY OF LEFT LOWER LIMB VEINS.

FINDINGS: Evaluation for DVT.

FINDINGS: The left lower limb veins are patent and compressible
along their length, there is normal phasic venous flow and
increased venous return with calf compression on color Doppler.

Some generalized edema noted in the subcutaneous tissues. No
collection.

CONCLUSION:
1. No DVT
2. Mild generalized subcutaneous edema noted.

DIAGNOSIS

1.  Fascia, left leg (A-B):

-  Necrotic fascia and fat with minimal inflammation.

-  Necrotic skeletal muscle with acute inflammation.

2.  Necrotic gluteus, left (C-D):

-  Necrotic fascia and fat with acute inflammation.

-  Skin with necrosis of subcutis.

3.  Left leg (E-K):

-  Skin and soft tissue (fascia, skeletal muscle, fat) with
extensive necrosis and acute inflammation; proximal margin is
focally involved.

-  Viable bone at resection margin.

-  Patent large vessels with mild-moderate atherosclerosis.

4.  Left proximal femoral head (L-N):

-  Necrotic soft tissue.

-  Unremarkable bone.



Clinical:  Necrotizing fascitis.

Gross:  The specimen is received fresh in four parts, each
labeled with "[**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **]" and the medical record number.



Part 1 is additionally labeled "fascia left leg" and consists of
a portion of necrotic muscle and fascia measuring 2.4 x 2.0 x
0.2 cm.  A portion of this is  submitted for frozen section.
Frozen section diagnosis by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Brown is:  "Necrotic muscle
and fascia with acute and chronic inflammation."  The specimen
is represented as follows:  A = frozen section remnant, B =
remainder of tissue.



Part 2 is additionally labeled "necrotic gluteus and leg
muscles" and consists of a 1200 gram aggregate of skin and
necrotic muscle measuring 14 x 14 x 13 cm.  In certain areas the
specimen is liquified and the necrosis extends to 0.5 cm of the
epidermal surface.  There are no discrete masses identified.
The specimen is represented in C-D.



Part 3 is additionally labeled " left leg" and consists of a leg
resected within the femur, measuring 80 cm long.  The foot
measures 22 cm long with white skin over the entire surface.
There are no skin lesions over the foot.  There is a linear
surgical defect at the lateral leg, starting 10 cm proximal to
the lateral malleolus extending up to the soft tissue resection
margin.  This surgical defect extends down deep to the fascia.
There is a portion of brown, necrotic appearing skeletal muscle
and fascia starting 14 cm from the proximal resection margin,
measuring 13 x 11 cm.  The fascia here has been incised
previously.  There is viable tissue apparent adjacent to the
tibia and femur, however the tissue is necrotic deep to the
fascia.  The vessels are dissected and there are mild
atherosclerotic changes visible within the popliteal vessels.
The dorsalis pedis appears grossly unremarkable.  The soft
tissue resection margin does appear involved by necrotic muscle,
however, the skin and the bone appear grossly unremarkable.  The
specimen is represented as follows: E-F = femur resection margin
after decal, G-H = soft tissue and skin resection margin, I =
necrotic appearing muscle, J = necrotic appearing fascia, K =
representative sections through popliteal and dorsalis pedis
vessels.



Part 4 is additionally labeled "left proximal head, femur" and
consists of a portion of femur with attached femoral neck and
femoral head measuring 14 x 9 x 3 cm.  Attached to the femur,
the portion of skeletal muscle and fascia measuring 9 x 8 x 6
cm.  There is focal  necrosis within the muscle, particularly
adjacent to bone.  The articular cartilage of the femoral head
appears focally eroded over an area measuring 1.7 x 0.8 cm.  The
necrotic soft tissue is represented in L.  The head of the femur
is hemisected to reveal a grossly unremarkable cortical bone,
with no areas of necrosis or cyst formation within the bone.
The area of articular erosion is represented in M after decal.



The femur and femoral neck are sectioned in the area adjacent to
the necrotic soft tissue to reveal grossly unremarkable bone,
with necrotic adjacent soft tissues.   Section of bone adjacent
to necrotic soft tissue is submitted in N after decal.
