Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 983**]
Chief Complaint:
Lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
82 year old male with past medical history of coronary artery
disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, BPH, chronic
kidney disease and gout who presents with intermittent confusion
and high fevers. The patient is [**First Name3 (LF) 595**] speaking only, generally
sleepy but family (son) recounts that the patient had difficulty
voiding 6/1-2/[**2150**]. At the time, he endorsed urinating
frequently but small amounts each time (?frequency, urgency)He
presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] and was found on urinalysis to have a
UTI. He did not have any fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, flank
pain at the time. He was discharged on Macrobid 100mg twice
daily X 7 days. The patient has been taking the medication
reliably but urine culture sensitivities/speciation today
demonstrated Enterobacter aerogenes sensitive to a number of
antibiotics, but resistant to macrobid. The patient's wife was
[**Name (NI) 653**] by the [**Name (NI) **] QA via [**Name (NI) 595**] interpreter and Cipro 250mg
tablets daily X 7 days was prescribed.
.
In the interim, the patient's son has been calling to check in
on him and found him progressively lethargic, dizzy and
intermittently unable to urinate. Today he slept throughout the
day and had some urinary frequency/urgency in the morning that
resolved this afternoon. He also developed high fevers
(temperature not taken) with rigors/shakes. He was noted to have
elevated blood sugars and lower blood pressures than normal. He
usually runs SBP160-180s, per his son, without antihypertensives
and SBP110-120s with them. This morning, he took all his
medications and subsequently, his blood pressures have been in
the SBP90s. The patient has taken in very little PO food/liquids
since [**2151-5-21**]. He did take one tablet of the Cipro this
afternoon and stated he felt somewhat better.
.
In the ED, initial VS: T100.8, HR96, BP111/46, RR20, O2 sat 97%
on RA. He was given acetaminophen 650mg PR and ciprofloacin
400mg IV X1. His labs were notable for hyponatremia (132), Cr
1.4 (close to prior baseline), leukocytosis to 11.9 with left
shift (no bands). His lactate was 1.6. He was also given IVF and
did become less lethargic, more interactive with family. He did
not urinate down in the ED to provide a repeat sample.
.
Upon transfer to the medical floor, vitals were T: 98.1 P: 88
BP: 103/45 RR: 25 SaO2: 95% on 2L NC (does not use oxygen at
home).

IMAGING:
[**2151-5-25**] NCHCT:  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema,
mass effect, or large acute territorial infarction.  The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is well preserved. There is
mild age-related brain parenchymal atrophy with secondary mild
dilatation of the ventricles.

The paranasal sinuses and mastoids are clear.  There are no
suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.

IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial abnormality.

NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is significantly
disproportionate
lateral more than 3rd ventriculomegaly, compared to the degree
of sulcal
prominence; while this may simply represent preferential central
atrophy,
underlying communicating hydrocephalus is an additional
consideration, and
should be correlated clinically.
[**2151-5-25**] CXR:  There is a right infrahilar and a right lung apex
opacity, possibly representing multifocal PNA. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila are normal.  There is no
pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
[**2151-5-25**] EKG:  Atrial fibrillation. Left axis deviation. Right
bundle-branch block. Consider inferior myocardial infarction.
Since the previous tracing
of [**2145-5-31**], atrial fibrillation is new, axis is now more
leftward, and
QRS width is wider. Clinical correlation is suggested.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T
90 0 172 410/462 0 -86 23
[**2151-5-26**] CXR:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has unchanged focal parenchymal opacities in the right upper and
right lower
