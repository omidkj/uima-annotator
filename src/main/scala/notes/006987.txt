[**2160-8-28**]:  cat scan of abdomen and pelvis:

IMPRESSION:

1.  Small-bowel obstruction with a transition point seen within
distal ileum within the patient's pannus anterior to the pubic
symphysis at that level.

2.  Growing soft tissue in the pre-sacral fat is again noted,
concerning for recurrence.

3.  Splenomegaly, unchanged

[**2160-9-1**]:  chest x-ray:

 CONCLUSION:

1.  Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.
2.  Stable right small pleural effusion.
3.  Stable bibasilar consolidation, more prominent on the right
side could be due only to atelectasis; however, superimposed
infection or aspiration cannot be excluded

[**2160-9-2**]:  chest x-ray:

FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an
increasing
signs suggestive of pulmonary edema, notably on the right, which
might be
caused by a change in patient position.  On the other hand, the
opacities on the left have mildly decreased in severity.  There
still is a small right pleural effusion with evidence of right
atelectasis, as well as moderate cardiomegaly.  The nasogastric
tube is in unchanged position.  No newly appeared parenchymal
opacities.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain and
vomiting. Upon admission, he was made NPO, given intravenous
fluids, and underwent imaging. Cat scan showed a small-bowel
obstruction with a transition point seen within the distal
ileum. He was placed on bowel rest and had placement of a
[**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube. His white blood cell count was normal.

His [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube was removed on HD #2. He required
replacement of the [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube for abdominal distention.
Because his abdominal pain and distention were not resolving,
and because he continued to have high [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube output,
he was taken to the operating room on HD # 3 where he underwent
an exploratory laparotomy and lysis of adhesions. His operative
course was notable for a large fluid requirement. He received
700 RBC, 750cc 5% albumin, 1600 cc intravenous fluids. He had a
300 cc blood loss. Intra-op, he required levophed for blood
pressure support. He was transferred to the intensive care unit
after the procedure for monitoring and continual resuscitation.
For full details of the procedure please see the operative
report dated [**2160-8-30**].

On POD #1, he was extubated. He had intermittent episodes of
hypoxia and his intravenous fluids were discontinued. His
surgical pain was controlled with a dilaudid PCA. On POD #3, he
experienced bouts of confusion and was started on his home
psychiatric medications, at which time, his [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube
was removed.  His anxiety seemed to decrease after starting on
his medications. His vital signs stabilized and he was
transferred to the surgical floor later that day.

During his post-operative course, he was reported to have bouts
of oxygen desaturation to the 80%'s both at rest and with
ambulation. Along with this, he had a decreased urine output and
was given intermittent doses of lasix with good results. On POD
#5 his diet was advanced to clears and he was seen by PT who
recommended short term rehab. On POD #6, he had a recurrence of
emesis and required replacement of the [**Last Name (un) **]-gastric tube. On
POD#7 his lasix were held as his Cr increased from 0.5-0.8 to
1.0. He continued to have O2 sats in the 88-93% range on 3L O2
by nasal cannula. He was given reglan and methylnaltrexone and
his NGT was clamped and subsequently removed on POD #8. His diet
was advanced to regular and his foley catheter was removed. He
was discharged to rehab on POD #9 with instructions to follow up
in the acute care surgery clinic on [**2160-9-18**] for staple removal.
At the time of discharge to rehab his O2 sats were 92-93% on 2L
by nasal cannula.
