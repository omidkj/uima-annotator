History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 year-old female with a history of DM2, HTN, CAD s/p
angioplasty, multiple vascular bypass procedures who presents
with weakness, cough, nausea and vomiting x 3-4 days.  The
patient lives in a senior residence with her own provide
apartment.  Her great-granddaughter has had a viral URI per the
family.  The family reports that she has been hving fevers to
102, decreased energy and nausea and vomiting.  Her po intake
has been severely decreased due to her vomiting.  Additionally,
the patient's breathing has also progressively worsened.  The
family reports that she was difficulty speaking to them.  She
was pale and just "didn't look well" so they brought her to the
ED. No recent travel or hospitalizations.
.
In the ED, 95.8 HR:63 BP:89/50 now 100/60 Resp:20 O(2)Sat:100.
The patient was hypotensive and received a total of 6L in the ED
with improvedment with SBP in the 90-100's.  She was given CTX,
Levoflox and Tamiflu. Additionally, she was given abuterol neb.
Her CXR showed left mid and right lower lung fields in chest
x-ray.  She developed worsening work of breathing, with belly
breathing and severe SOB.  She was intubated in the ED and then
sent to the MICU

Radiology Report CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2152-1-13**]
12:06 PM

UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: The cardiac silhouette is normal
in size. The
mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. The
right internal
jugular central venous catheter has been removed. There are
subtle focal
airspace opacities projecting over the left mid lung field as
well as the
right lower lung field, which could represent sites of
infection. There is no
pleural effusion or pneumothorax seen. The pulmonary vascularity
is within
normal limits. No acute skeletal abnormalities are present.

IMPRESSION: Ill-defined focal opacities within the left mid and
right lower
lung fields, which could infection.
