History of Present Illness:
41M h/o ESLD [**1-22**] HCV and EtOH on [**Month/Day (2) **] list, esophageal
varices, OSA, pHTN, recurrent hepatic encephalopathy requiring
intubation transferred from OSH intubated after aspiration event
at home.
.
According to his mother, the day prior to admission he reported
not feeling well, although unclear specific complaints. GI was
contact[**Name (NI) **] and had scheduled him for a paracentesis today.
Overnight while he was sleeping with CPAP, which his mother
monitors on a baby monitor, he vomited into his CPAP mask and
likely aspirated. He could not be aroused. EMS was called and
brought him to OSH where he was unresponsive and therefore
intubated (on intubation 'bits of corn' were noted around vocal
cords). OGT placed with return of clear/pink fluid but no blood
or coffee grounds. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
.
In the ED, he was hemodynamically stable (vitals 97.1, 104,
106/71, 12, 100%). Labs notable for WBC 8.2, Cre 1.3 (increased
from 0.9), LFTs stable from prior, U/A negative, ammonia 383,
lactate 2.1. Blood cultures were sent and levo given for
aspiration. ABG not obtained. PIV for access. CT head negative.
CT abd/pelvis unchanged with large simple ascites. Admit ICU.

Brief Hospital Course:
41 yo male with ESLD with cirrhosis, pulm HTN, found
unresponsive at home, intubated at [**Hospital1 **] for airway protection,
requiring ICU admission for encephalopathic unresponsiveness.
.
# Respiratory failure:  Likely secondary to aspiration. ?
chemical pneumonitis. AMS (see below) may have contributed as
well as long history of hepatic encephalopathy requiring
intubation. No evidence of infection. CT head negative. No
antibiotics given. NG tube initially required but removed early
in course as patient's encephalopathy improved.

.
# AMS: Patient has multiple episodes of unresponsiveness
requiring intubation in the past two months due to hepatic
encephalopathy significantly improved.  Appears exquistely
sensitive to missed doses of Lactulose. Lactulose was
aggressively administered throughout hospitalization. Tox screen
was negative.  CT head negative.
- Lactulose per NG tube for stool output >1L per day
- Tox screen negative
.
.
# ESLD: Due to ETOH/HepC with recurrent severe hepatic
encephalopathy requiring intubation. Known ascites requiring
frequent [**Doctor First Name 4397**] and varices requiring banding, followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 497**], on [**Last Name (STitle) **] list although unclear how pulmonary HTN may
affect listing.  ECHO revealed Hyperdynamic LV systolic
function. Normal RV systolic function. No pathologic valvular
abnormality seen. Echo cannot accurately assess volume status.
Lactulose was aggressively adminsitered. Paracentesis draining
9L was done on [**1-5**]. Nadolol and Rifaximin were given.

.
# Anemia: Known Grade II varices s/p banding without evidence
active bleeding and stable Hct. Chronically G+ stool. Maintained
2 large bore PIV's, active type and screen. Initially on
Octreotide gtt. Pt. stable over end of hospitalization.

.
# Thrombocytopenia: [**1-22**] liver disease. Platelets within
baseline.
.
# Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine 88mcg daily.
.
# Pulmonary HTN: Continued iloprost inhalation 6x/day.
.
# OSA: CPAP once extubated.
.
#CODE: Remained Full
