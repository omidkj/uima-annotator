Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 25936**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p Cathetrization on [**6-17**]

History of Present Illness:
67 yo M with CAD s/p CABG & multiple PCI, CHF, DMII who
presented [**6-14**] to [**Hospital3 **] with chest pain. He had
previously been admitted there [**Date range (1) 25856**] with unstable angina
and renal failure, but had refused cath because he was concerned
about his kidneys. He then had increasing chest pain so he
re-presented to LGH and EKG there showed ST depressions in
V2-V6, trop 1= 0.01, troponin 2= 3.2, troponin 3= 3.64 troponin
4= 2.92(done at 6/24 16:00). ECHO was done that showed EF 60%.
He has been chest pain free since 11PM on [**6-14**] on nitro gtt
30mcg and heparin gtt 1200. He received mucomyst at 11am due to
creatinine of 1.5.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. he denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. he denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Physical Exam:
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:

GENERAL: NAD. Oriented x3. Mood, affect appropriate.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. No xanthalesma.

NECK: Supple with JVP at level of clavicle at 30%.
CARDIAC: RR, III/VI HSM LSB No r/g. No thrills, lifts. No S3 or
S4.
LUNGS: Resp were unlabored, no accessory muscle use. CTAB, no

ABDOMEN: Large ventral hernia, eccymosis throughout the lower
abdomen, obese, Soft, NTND. Could not palpate Abd aorta
EXTREMITIES: 2+ BILATERAL PITTING EDEMA to mid calf
Right: Carotid 2+ DP 2+
Left: Carotid 2+ DP 2+


Pertinent Results:
Portable Chest X-Ray [**6-16**]: Right PICC tip is in the mid SVC.
Small bilateral pleural effusions are larger on the left side.
Cardiac size is top normal. Aside from minimal atelectasis in
the left lower lobe, the lungs are clear. Patient is status post
CABG.

Cardiac Cath [**6-16**]: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this
right dominant system demonstrated three vessel disease. The
LMCA had a 60% diffuse stenosis. The LAD had an 80% ostial
stenosis and 50% midvessel diffuse stenosis; and 80% ostial
stenosis of D1 and a 95% ostial stenosis of D2. The LCx had a
99% ostial stenosis with TIMI I flow; 100% stenosis of OM1. The
RCA had an 80% mid-vessel stenosis.
2. Graft angiography revealed a patent LIMA-LAD. The RIMA-RPL
was widely
patent. The SVG-OM1 had a 30% in-stent restenosis in the
proximal
portion of the graft and a 90% stenosis in the native OM1 just
distal to
the anastamosis; OM1 is a small calibur vessel.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed SBP 104 mm Hg and DBP
of 51 mm
Hg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Left main and three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. LIMA-LAD patent, RIMA-RPL patent, SVG-OM1 patent.
3. Most likely culprit for current presentation is native LCx
which is
most likely sub-totally occluded.  Other areas of ischemia
include OM1,
D1, and D2.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 83557**] is a 67 y/o male with a history of CAD s/p
CABG in [**2153**](LIMA-LAD, RIMA-RPL, SVG-OM) and multiple PCI's,
CHF, who was transferred from an OSH with episodes of chest pain
with positive cardiac enzymes and EKG changes suggestive of
NSTEMI.

# NSTEMI: Patient had positive troponins and ST changes on EKG
with associated chest pain suggestive of NSTEMI. Patient with
previous admission for unstable angina, three vessel disease s/p
CABG (LIMA-LAD, RIMA-RPL, SVG-OM1) and failed PCIs. He had
cardiac arrest during previous cath, so initially refused cath
at the OSH. Patient was very nervous about whether or not he
would survive cath and whether or not it would help him
symptomatically. However due to increasing frequency and
duration of pain on a nitro drip he consented. He was also very
concerned about his kidney function and the dye load he would
receive. He is s/p cath on [**6-16**] which revealed native three
vessel disease with worsening Cx and left main disease. They did
not intervene however they recommended going back to cath on
[**6-19**] for intervention on the Cx and possibley the left main. He
was subsequently optimized medically with aspirin, plavix, IV
heparin, metoprolol, and atorvastatin. He was also on a nitro
drip and was pain free. He did have 2 episodes of chest pain on
the nitro drip with associated ST depressions in V2-V6 and ST
elevation in aVR. Early after transfer to CCU for management of
SBO, his angina became more unstable, eventually requiring an
esmolol drip to control his HR as his angina is very HR
dependent. ST depressions seen with CP. Integrilin started
because of inability to take Plavix given SBO.

# Abdominal Pain/Nausea/Vomiting: Patient developed nausea and
abdominal pain with 3 subsequent bouts of vomiting on [**6-17**]. He
first attributed his nausea to his lunch but he continued to
vomit even after antiemetics were administered. It was also
noted that his large vental hernia was distended and difficult
to reduce. This was concerning for obstruction so surgery was
consulted. They recommended NG tube placement and IV fluid
thereapy. KUB showed a nonspecific bowel gas pattern with air
and stool seen throughout colon and non-dilated loops of small
bowel.
Due to his instability, he was transferred to the CCU for closer
monitoring. Pt was NPO with NG tube for decompression for
aproximately 9 days.
# Congestive Heart failure: Very mildly fluid overloaded on exam
with most notable symptoms beiing worsened orthopnea. His Bumex
3mg was reduced to once a day, continued lopressor.

# DMII: Patient was on a sliding scale and blood sugars were
well controlled.

# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: At previous admission to OSH,
diuretics were held and kidney function improved to baseline
(1.7). Bumex 3mg po tid was started [**6-9**], but aldactone and
metolazone were still on hold and ACE inhibitor was also not
restarted. He was at baseline creatinine pre and post cath.

# Hypothyroidism: He continued his levothyroxine
