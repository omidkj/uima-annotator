Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
transferred from [**Hospital3 **] per family preference

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation, mechanical ventilation, R IJ central line placement,
L radial arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
63 yo F who is transferred from [**Hospital3 **], after
presenting on [**2197-4-7**] with 3 weeks of "cold symptoms" and one
week of body ache and malaises with R-sided chest and abdomal
pain and hand swelling.  Patient was found to have CAP with
r-sided effusion.  She was admitted to the ICU and a chest tube
was placed [**2197-4-9**] for drainage of parapneumonic effusion (see
labs below) when her WBC was 22.3.  Patients initial blood cx
showed [**2-18**] growing step pneumo resistent to levaquin. Her
respiratory status worsened and her O2 requirement increased.
She developed 10cc of hempotysis,  She was intubated [**2197-4-11**] for
increased work of breathing and respiratory distress, and it was
noted the intubation may have been complicated by aspiration.
ABG prior to intubation was 7.37/45/76 on 100% nonrebreather.
Per report, was hypotensive peri-intubation but responded to
fluid bolus.
.
Patient's family requested transfer of care to [**Hospital1 18**].

CT Chest [**2197-4-12**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Multifocal pneumonia, may be bacterial with bilateral pleural
effusions and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. If this does not fit
the clinical scenario, then lymphoma is a consideration.
2. Right small apical pneumothorax.
3. Tiny pericardial effusion.
4. High-density material in the gallbladder. [**Month (only) 116**] be sludge or
contrast from prior procedure.
.
ECHO [**2197-4-20**]
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
severe mitral
annular calcification. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen
(within normal limits).
6.There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
  Ms. [**Known lastname 67167**] is a 63 yo woman transferred from OSH with R-sided
pneumonia, para pneumonic pleural effusion, chest tube, and
recent bacteremia with Levofloxacin resistant organisms,
Penicillin/CTX resistant (intermediate) strep pneumonia.  She
was intubated and a chest tube was placed at [**Hospital3 **].
She was initially started on vancomycin pending sensitivities,
and once they returned she was continued on this course, however
the patient appeared to be worsening, so Zosyn was added for
broader coverage.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for family
preference.
  At [**Hospital1 18**] all cultures of blood, sputum, stool, and urine
remained negative.  The patient continued to spike fevers for
the first few days of her stay but eventually this resolved.
She was continued on [**Doctor Last Name **] co and Zosyn and completed a 14 day
course.  She was also treated with a 6 day course of steroids
for possible underlying COPD (pt has no history, but has a 30py
smoking history).
  The patient had labile blood pressure in the unit, requiring
metoprolol which was slowly increased to her home atenolol dose
equivalent, however on several occasions she had hypotension
requiring fluid boluses.  This resolved for the last three days
the patient spent in the ICU and she was kept on her beta
blocker without problem.
  The patient was sedated with fentanyl and versed, as well as
Haldol for agitation while on the ventilator.  Initial trial of
extubation was quickly failed, as the patient began wheezing
almost immediately. She was quickly reintubated and follow up
CXR showed pulmonary edema. The pt was noted to have a small
right apical pneumothorax. The patient was positive 8 L during
her stay in the unit, and this was then aggressively diuresed.
After diuresis the patient was again extubated, with
nitroglycerin drip used for 30 minutes peri-extubation, this
time successfully and she remained on shovel mask, follow by NC
and saturations remained consistently in the mid to high 90s.
She was called out of the ICU to the floor.
  On the floor, the pt's pneumothorax was noted to resolve on
repeat CXR, she remained afebrile and did not have a significant
oxygen requirement. She was given a Pneumovax vaccine. The pt
was discharged with instructions to follow-up with her primary
care provider for evaluation of her anemia and was recommended a
colonoscopy and was recommended to avoid air travel for 1 week
after discharge.
