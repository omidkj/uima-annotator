Imaging:
CXR: [**2190-2-23**]
FINDINGS: Moderate cardiac enlargement is present; however,
precise heart
size is difficult to assess because of high positioned
diaphragms and
bilateral pleural effusions blunting the lateral and posterior
pleural
sinuses. There are bilateral extensive confluenting parenchymal
infiltrates predominantly in the central portions of the lungs
and thus compatible with acute CHF and pulmonary edema. Question
concerning fluid overload cannot be answered. As we have no
previous chest examinations available in our records for
comparison. Also observed is the presence of a bipolar metallic
prosthesis in the left shoulder.
IMPRESSION: Cardiac enlargement, pulmonary edema and bilateral
pleural
effusions. Further followup and evaluation recommended.

Echo: [**2190-2-24**]
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded (inferior wall appears borderline
hypokinetic in some suboptimal views). Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. At least moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Significant MR (unclear etiology).

TEE: [**2190-2-26**]
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral
regurgitation vena contracta is >=0.7cm. The degree of
regurgitation was made worse with Trendelenberg and
phenylephrine infusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrinbe briefly. A pacing.
Well-seated valvuloplasty ring in the mitral position with trace
mr. LVEF remains normal. The aortic contour is normal post
decannulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
Medicine course:

Patient is a 51 yo female with no cardiac history who presents
with cough x 6 weeks, fatigue and several days of dyspnea found
to have mitral regurgitation and signs and symptoms of CHF.
.
# PUMP: Patient has history of mitral valve prolape and diet
controlled dyslipidemia. She was admitted with cough, fatigue,
dyspnea for the past several weeks with acute worsening of her
dyspnea over the days prior to admission. Echo showed severe
mitral regurgutation with EF 65-70%. Mitral regurgitation was
the most likely cause of her CHF. The etiology of her mitral
regurgitation is unknown. Blood cultures were obtained to
evaluated for endocarditis and were negative to date
(**********please check final micro prior to d/c***********).
Patient responded well to lasix and was negative 6 L in the CCU
but was still quite dyspneic and requiring O2 via nasal cannula
and/or non-rebreather. She was taken for mitral valve repair on
[**2190-2-26**].

# CORONARIES: Patient has no known coronary disease. EKG showed
no ischemic changes and cardiac biomarkers were negative.

# RHYTHM: Patient is in sinus rhythm. She was monitored on
telemetry and potassium was kept above 4 and magnesium was kept
above 2.

#Leukocytosis: Patient has leukocytosis to 14.7 on admission
which was as high as 20 at OSH. Leukocytosis was thought to be
related to recent use of steroids and trended down. There was no
sign of infection and all culture data was negative.

# Chronic pain: Patient has chronic pain from multiple surgeries
(hip/ shoulder) as well as chronic abdominal pain. She continued
to have abdominal pain during her hospitalization which is
unchanged from prior.  She was continued on her home oyxcodone
and neurontin.

# Bipolar Disorder/ Depression: Patient has significant
pyschiatric comorbidity. Prior to her cardiac catherization, she
was very anxious which was contributing to her shortness of
breath. She required extra doses of iv lorazepam. She was
continued on her home citalopram, lorazepam, trazodone. Her
lithium level had to be intermittently held for high levels of
lithium. She was dis
