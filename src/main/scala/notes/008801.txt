HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year-old female wit
peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease status
post coronary artery bypass graft, carotid disease (40 to 59%
on the right and 40% on the left), subclavian stenosis,
congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction of 25%
status post ICD.  The patient was in her usual state of
health prior to admission, yesterday complained of substernal
chest pain at around 12:00 p.m. characterized 5 out of 10
radiating across shoulders, diaphoresis and no other
associated symptoms.  The patient thought it would go away,
but when persisted decided to call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**] who advised her
to go to the Emergency Department.  Called daughter who then
drove her to [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1459**] Hospital.  Pain to door was
approximately three hours. She was given heparin, Integrilin,
aspirin, Plavix, sublingual nitroglycerin and patch and
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] at around
7:00 for further management.  Cardiac catheterization on
[**2135-12-14**] showed LMCA with distal 30%, left anterior
descending coronary artery osteal 40% with diffuse disease
and serial 70 to 80% stenosis in mid vessel and distal
luminal irregularities.  Left circumflex showed diffuse
tortuous disease with 90% serial stenosis around mid vessel.
Right coronary artery known occluded and not injected.  Left
circumflex in an attempt to open up artery was dissected and
perforated.  Left circumflex was then treated with three
serial pixel stents.  The patient was transferred
subsequently to the Coronary Care Unit for more closer
hemodynamic monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Ventricular tachycardia status post ICD placement in
[**5-7**].
2.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2129**] after acute myocardial infarction, left
internal mammary coronary artery to left anterior descending
coronary artery, arteritic, saphenous vein graft to right
coronary artery occluded, saphenous vein graft to obtuse
marginal two occluded.  Catheterization on [**5-7**] native three
vessel disease and occluded graft.  At that time she had a
wedge pressure of 6 and an LVEDP of 13.  ETT on [**2-7**] at
outside hospital showed lateral fixed defect and
anterolateral ischemia.
3.  Mitral regurgitation 4+ shown on catheterization of [**5-7**]
and 1+ AI.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Cardiovascular disease with carotid stenosis bilaterally.
6.  Peripheral vascular disease with bilateral claudication
right more then left.
7.  Hyperlipidemia.
8.  Atrial fibrillation complicated by Amiodarone toxicity
(pulmonary).
9.  Obstructive, restrictive lung disease, history of tobacco
use.  FEV1 is 1.61 86% of predicted, TLC is equal to 2.73
liters, 62% predicted.
10.  Left subclavian stenosis (70%) with 60 mmHg gradient,
prior to left internal mammary coronary artery.  Right
subclavian stenosis (30%) with 15 mmHg gradient.
11.  Status post tonsillectomy.
12.  Congestive heart failure with an EF of 40% in [**5-7**].

OUTSIDE HOSPITAL LABORATORIES:  White blood cell count 16.2,
hematocrit 44.1, platelets 323.  Chem panel sodium 142,
potassium 4.6, chloride 105, bicarb 26, BUN 18, creatinine
0.8, glucose 107.  [**Name (NI) 2591**], PT 12.1, PTT 30, INR 1.0.  Cardiac
enzymes CPK 93, CKMB 8, CKMB 19, troponin T 0.288.
Electrocardiogram interpretation left axis deviation, [**Street Address(2) 4793**]
depressions in 1, L, T waves in 3 and F, [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions
in V2 through V6, left atrial hypertrophy.  Echocardiogram in
[**2135**], severe left ventricular dysfunction with EF of 25%,
atrial enlargement, moderate mitral regurgitation (4+ on
cardiac catheterization).  Cardiac catheterization [**2135-12-14**],
LMCA distal 30%.  Left anterior descending coronary artery
40% with diffuse disease and serial 70 to 80% stenosis in mid
vessel and distal luminal irregularities.  Left circumflex
diffuse tortuous disease with 90% serial stenosis at mid
vessel.  Right coronary artery known occluded and not
injected.  Hemodynamics, RA 7, pulmonary capillary wedge 18,
PA 42/21/29, aorta 135/57, cardiac output 2.51, cardiac index
1.73.  Increased right and left filling pressures, but not
equalized.  Intervention, left circumflex dissected and
perforated and treated with three serial pixel stents.
Cardiac catheterization [**2135-12-15**], LMCA distal 40%.  Left
anterior descending coronary artery, proximal calcifications
60% stenosis, serial 70 to 90% stenosis to distal vessel.
Left circumflex no significant change from yesterday.  Widely
patent stents.  Right coronary artery known occluded not
injected.  Hemodynamics, aorta 115/48.  Intervention, mid
vessel of left anterior descending coronary artery was
dissected by the balloon inflation distal flow down the
artery was lost.  Hepacoat stent was to be put at mid vessel,
cipher drug eluding stent was then deployed in the proximal
overlapping fashion, Hepacoat stent was deployed in the
distal vessels to cover residual disease, cipher stent was
deployed in the ostium.  All stents overlapping from ostium
to distal left anterior descending coronary artery.  Final
angiography revealed normal flow, no dissections and 0%
residual stenosis in the stents and a 1.5 to 2.0 mm diagonal
with residual 90% stenosis mid vessel and 40% stenosis in the
ostium.

Echocardiogram [**2135-12-15**] conclusions, left ventricular
systolic function appears depressed.  There is no pericardial
effusion. Indications for echocardiogram were evaluation for
pericardial effusion.  Portal chest x-ray on [**2135-12-18**]
indication, fever and pleuritic chest pain.  Impression was
mild congestive heart failure with interstitial edema,
superimposed upon the more chronic interstitial pattern,
which has been previously treated with IVF.  New left basilar
opacity, which may be related to pneumonia.  There is also a
new small left pleural effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was
transferred to the hospital and was immediately transported
to catheterization.  The patient had intervention on the left
circumflex that was complicated by dissection and
perforation.  This was treated with the three serial pixel
stents and transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for more
closer monitoring.  The patient was started on aspirin,
Plavix, statin and antihypertensives were held overnight.
The patient was watched closely via telemetry and hemodynamic
monitoring.  Swan was left in the right atrium to look out
for tamponade.  CVPs that night remained within normal limits
of 4 to 8.  The morning after the cardiac catheterization the
patient was complaining of chest pain 7 out of 10 across the
shoulders.  E
