HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 76 year old female with a
history of HOCM, history of CHF, mitral regurg, COPD who is
presenting now status post ethanol ablation and complete
heart block.

1.  Cardiac.  Coronary: continued aspirin.  Pump: given her
history of HOCM, she is now status post ethanol septal
ablation.  Checking cardiac enzymes to see peak.  Also check
chest x-ray for pacemaker placement.  EP: complete heart
block.  Will follow.  Continue with telemetry.  Patient with
temporary pacemaker, may require permanent one if not
improved.  Holding all calcium channel blockers and beta
blockers for the time being while the patient was admitted.

While the patient was in the hospital she was continued on
aspirin.  The patient had a permanent pacemaker placed on
[**2173-10-15**].  To follow up for the pacemaker.  For her coronary
disease she was added back on beta blockers and for coronary
disease also was on aspirin and ACE inhibitor.  Rhythm: she
is now status post pacemaker on the day of discharge without
complications.  She was pacing at about 80 the day before
discharge on beta blockers.  Chest x-ray showed also good
placement of the pacemaker.  Pump: she had 2+ MR, 1+ AR.  CHF
resolving on chest x-ray and also on exam and also decreased
weight by 2 kg post diuresis.  CHF on exam improved
dramatically with Lasix.  For COPD she was continued on MDI
regimen and also with incentive spirometry which she was
doing really well.

For chronic renal insufficiency the patient's baseline
creatinine was 1.4.  She had good urine output.  Creatinine
the day before discharge was 1.2, better than her regular
baseline.  The patient did well status post ablation therapy
and follow up as directed below.  The patient was discharged
