Brief Hospital Course:
After the operation he was admitted to the ICU for observation.
During the night following admission, the patient continued to
bleed out of the unclosed openings of his mouth.  Eventually
required surgicell packing of oral cavity to stave off continued
bleeding.  Unclear [**Name2 (NI) **] loss quantity but hematocrit remained
stable.  Secondary to the ongoing bleeding and significant
drainage of dark red contents from NGT it was felt that the
patient should remain  intubated until HD 2.  Given inability to
intubate through the oropharynx, pt was extubated over
bronchoscope by ENT, w/o complication.  Secondary to the ongoing
bleeding, Plavix and ASA were held Pt has been continued on
cefazolin 1g renally dosed w/ plan to continue for 7 day course
for propylaxis.
On HD2, pt developed low grade temperature to 100.4, and sputum
and urine were sent.  Sputum grew out 4+ GNR and 4+ GPC in
clusters, chains, pairs.  There was no indication for treatment
as pt was w/o s/sx of PNA and developed no further temperature.
He was maintained on IV Lopressor and transitioned to orals on
HD 3.
His fluid status was largely determined by HD.  Only 1.3L taken
off on HD1 and pt remains w/ some residual UE edema.  Daily CXRs
were followed and O2 requirements were closely monitored.
He underwent another session of HD and 3L were taken off. His
breathing improved (95-97% on RA) and he voided after his Foley
catheter was discontinued.
On day af his dicharge he was able to ambulate, void and breathe
w/o difficulty. His surgical sites were d/c/i.
