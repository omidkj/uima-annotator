Final Report
HISTORY: Pneumothorax.

Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval
removal of the
support lines seen on [**2179-1-12**]. There is interval worsening of
linear and
plate-like atelectasis involving the bilateral lung bases, most
pronounced on
the left. Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Sternotomy
wires are
intact. Trachea is midline. No pneumothorax is identified. There
is likely
a small left-sided pleural effusion.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD
by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D images. Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal diameter of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch
levels. Normal descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]S.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Physiologic
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. Resting bradycardia

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results at the time of
the examination.

Post_Bypass:
Preserved biventricular systolic function.
Trivial MR, TR.
Intact thoracic aorta.
Normal LVEF 55%
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**1-9**] Mr.[**Known lastname **] was admitted to Cardiology after presenting to
the ED with unstable angina and a know history of CAD. A repeat
catheterization was performed and Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was consulted for
coronary revascularization. Carotid duplex study showed <40%
stenosis. [**1-12**] Mr.[**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where
he underwent CABG x4 with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**]. Please refer to operative
report for further details. He was intubated and sedated on
propofol and required Phenylephrine immediately postop. He was
transferred to the CVICU in
