Abd: NTND
Rectal: no blood

Ext: [**3-30**] upper and lE strength

Pertinent Results:
Trauma series: Multiple right rib fractures.  Possible
mediastinal widening and hemorrhage. Subcutaneous emphysema and
possible PTX. Normal pelvis.

CT C spine: no fractures

CT L spine:
1. No evidence of fracture or abnormal alignment of the
component vertebrae.
2. Mild disc bulging at multiple levels likely representing
degenerative changes.
3. Small ill-defined lytic lucency on the right iliac bone of
uncertain etiology. If there is clinical concern for metastasis
bone scan can be performed.

CT T spine:
1. Multiple right-sided displaced rib fractures.
2. Small medial right-sided apical pneumothorax.
3. Equivocal first vertebral right-sided transverse fracture.

CT Head: No overt intracranial hemorrhage.

CT Torso: 1) Multiple right-sided rib fractures involving the
3rd through 8th ribs, with associated pneumothorax, right lung
contusions, and small hydrohemothorax.
2) Poorly defined area of hypoattenuation seen in the right lobe
of the liver likely represents beam hardening artifact from
overlying patient arm.
No evidence of active extravasation.
3) Fatty infiltration of large bowel wall consistent with
inflammatory bowel disease.

CXR ([**1-10**])post CT placement: The new right chest tube appears
kinked. No evidence of pneumothorax.

CXR ([**1-10**]): Chest tube is present in the right lower hemithorax.
There is an equivocal tiny right apical pneumothorax.
Subcutaneous emphysema is present in the right chest wall and
there is a fracture of the right fifth rib anteriorly. Small
focal ill-defined opacities are present in the right lower zone.
No previous films or CT scans available for review.

CXR ([**1-11**]): displaced rib fx

CXR ([**1-12**]): s/p CT: Small right apical pneumothorax.

CXR ([**1-13**]): A previously reported right pneumothorax has nearly
resolved in the interval with only a tiny residual lateral
pneumothorax remaining at the apex. Bibasilar atelectasis and
right-sided rib deformities are without interval change.

CXR ([**1-15**]): A previously reported right pneumothorax has nearly
resolved in the interval with only a tiny residual lateral
pneumothorax remaining at the apex. Bibasilar atelectasis and
right-sided rib deformities are without interval change.

CTA: New pulmonary embolism within the distal right pulmonary
artery extending into all three segments of the right upper
lobe.
2. Slight interval increase in right pleural effusion likely
representing hemothorax.
3. Bilateral atelectasis right greater than left.
4. Right middle lobe focal opacification, probably representing
contusion.
5. Multiple right-sided rib fractures, unchanged.

U/S: There is normal compressibility, augmentation, and
respiratory variation within the deep veins of both lower
extremities. There is no evidence of DVT.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. was admitted after a fall from approximately 10 feet.  On
imaging, pt. found to have right sided pneumothorax and multiple
rib fractures.  Pt. had a chest tube placed in the trauma bay
for a pneumothorax.  At first there was a question of a hepatic
contusion so pt. was admitted to ICU for serial exams and crits.


Neuro: pt. w/ lots of pain from rib fractures.  Pt. had dilaudid
PCA with some pain control.  Pt. was eventually changed to PO
dilaudid, oxycontin and ativan for pain relief.  Pt. was d/c on
this combination of pain control

Spine: Pt. w/ ? of right transverse process fx on CT, so
ortho/spine was consulted.  They evaluated the films and patient
and cleared pt's C-spine on HD 2 and c-collar was removed.

Cardiac: nl EKG except on [**2187-1-16**] when pt. became tachycardic
and tachypneic.  An EKG showed sinus tachycarida.  Pt. found to
have a PE.

Resp: Pt. had a CT placed in the trauma bay. This chest tube was
put on waterseal on HD2 and was removed on HD3 w/ resolving ptx
on chest xray.  Pt. w/ multiple R. sided rib fractures, so pt.
struggled w/ deep inspiration throughout hospital stay.  Pt. w/
atelectasis on CXR.  Pt. used IS regulalry and will continue to
use this at home. Pt. was OOB to chair by HD3 and was ambulating
HD4/5.  PT evaluated pt. and felt that he was safe to be d/c
home.  On HD 6 [**1-16**], pt. became tachycardic and tachypneic.  Pt.
had an emergent CTA that showed a Right sided PE and effusion.
Interventional pulmonology was consulted and the effusion was
tapped - 600 cc serosanguinous fluid.  Pt. started on heparin
and HD 9, pt. was started on coumadin.  Pt. became therapeutic
on coumadin on HD 11 and was d/c home w/ PCP follow up.  Pt. had
b/l ultrasounds and no DVT was identified.

GI: Original CT read was ? of hepatic contusion, so pt had
serial exams and crits checked. These were stable.  On final
read, this was felt to be motion artifact and not a liver
laceration.  Pt. diet was advanced and was tolerated.

GU: pt. had a foley that was d/c on HD3 without any problems.

MSK: Pt. w/ rib pain that was controlled w/ dilaudid.  Pt.
originally w/ some paresthesias in arm after fall, but this
resolved by HD2.  Pt. w/ no pain, nl strenghtn and sensation.

Proph: Pt. received heparin 5000 units SC
tid/protonix/pneumoboots

Dispo: pt. evaluated by PT and they felt it was safe to go home.
