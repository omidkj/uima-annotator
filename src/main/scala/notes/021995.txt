IMAGING:
[**2125-1-20**] ABD/PELVIC CT W/CONTRAST:
1. Distended gallbladder with surrounding pericholecystic fat
stranding is concerning for acute cholecystitis. An ultrasound
is suggested for further evaluation.
2. 1.7 x 2.0 cm partially calcified mass adjacent to the
uncinate process of the pancreas can be further evaluated by
MRCP.
3. 6 mm nodule in the left adrenal gland (2:25) is
indeterminate. This can also be evaluated on subsequent MRCP.
3. Colonic diverticulosis with no diverticulitis.
4. Small hiatal hernia.
5. Fibrotic changes of the inferior lung most compatible with
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
6. Decreased intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation status post
bile duct stent placement. Continued enhancement of the cystic
duct, proximal to the confluence of the previously noted common
hepatic duct stricture.
.
[**2125-1-20**] LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US:
Targeted grayscale and color evaluation of the gallbladder was
performed. The gallbladder is distended, and contains sludge and
debris. The gallbladder wall is thickened, with suggestion of
gallbladder wall edema. A small amount of perihepatic fluid is
noted. The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow.
Evaluation for a snographic [**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign was limited as the
patient had received pain medication prior to this study.

IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for acute cholecystitis.
.
[**2125-1-20**] CXR: Findings consistent with chronic interstitial lung
disease. No definite change.
.
[**2125-1-24**] Chest CT:
Since the prior chest CT in [**11-20**], there is marked worsening of
extensive, geographic ground glass opacities bilaterally, but
worse on the left. This is superimposed on the previous
background of fibrotic changes, honeycombing and traction
bronchiectasis characteristic of UIP. This most likely
represents a marked progression of disease. Given the asymmetric
distribution, a superimposed process such as pulmonary edema is
less likely, and this appearance is not characteristic of
infection.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service on
[**2125-1-21**] for evaluation of severe abdominal pain.  Upon
admission, he was made NPO, started on IV fluids, started on
empiric IV Unasyn, a foley catheter was placed, and he was given
IV Dilaudid PRN for pain with good effect. Admission CXR
revealed chronic interstitial lung disease without definite
change. Abdominal CT showed a distended gallbladder with
surrounding pericholecystic fat stranding is concerning for
acute cholecystitis.  Abdominal Ultrasound findings consistent
with acute cholecystitis. Later that day, he underwent
ultrasound-guided percutaneous cholecystostomy tube
placement with drainage of 145 cc of dark bilious material,
which was successful. He remained hemodynamically stable. After
the procedure, he was started on clear liquids, which was
advanced to a regular diet by [**2125-1-23**] with good tolerability.
The patient was heplocked, and the foley catheter discontinued.
He was subsequently able to void without problem.
.
On [**2125-1-23**], the patient was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 9
hemodynamically stable. At this point, the plan of care was to
discharge him home and have him return in 1 week for
cholecystectomy and possible Roux-En-Y. The Pulmonary Service
was consulted for pre-operative evealuation given his history of
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). It was found that
