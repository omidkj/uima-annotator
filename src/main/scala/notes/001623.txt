Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**]
Chief Complaint:
Abdominal Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
81yoM HTN, CHF, Stage III CKD, lung cancer s/p wedge resection,
prostate CA, s/p hormonal tx and XRT presented [**3-29**] with 4 days
RLQ pain, admitted to surgery for ruptured appendix which was
medically managed, transferred to medicine service on night of
transfer after a trigger for tachycardia.
   Pt presented [**3-28**] with RLQ abd pain.  Per surgery note, pt
reported he was in his usual state of health until 4 days prior
to presentation when he purchased a bottle of wine and drank [**2-5**]
of the bottle, followed by dull pain and tenderness in RLQ
without radiation.  Pain persisted over the next four days,
relatively unchanged, until the pt presented to his PCP for an
urgent care visit on [**2107-3-28**]. During this time, he notes
decreased appetite and loose
stools 2-3x/day. He denies fevers, chills. He notes chronic SOB
unchanged recently and denies chest pain.
   Pt was admitted to surgery service on [**3-28**], had a CT of abd,
which showed a perforated appendix with possible early abscess
formation.  He was started on hep sq, cipro, and flagyl, and
medically managed on surgery service.
   Transferred from [**Hospital Ward Name 1950**] 5 at 7pm from surgery service to
medicine service.  HR upon transfer 100, sbp ~100, 2l oxygen.
Around 2200, staff noticed pt "not looking good," hr rose to
120-130s, pt diuresed 10mg iv lasix, bp dropped from 110/60 to
96/56 to 92/58, remained on 2L.  Also received one albuterol
neb, ipratropium neb, and PO ativan for concern for ethanol
withdrawal.  EKG showed rapid rate at 130, likely afib, nl axis.

PHYSICAL EXAM
GENERAL: Pleasant, well appearing ..... in NAD
HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic.  No conjunctival pallor. No
scleral icterus. PERRLA/EOMI. MMM. OP clear.  Neck Supple, No
LAD, No thyromegaly.
CARDIAC: Regular rhythm, normal rate. Normal S1, S2. No murmurs,
rubs or [**Last Name (un) 549**].  JVP=
LUNGS: CTAB, good air movement biaterally.
ABDOMEN: NABS. Soft, NT, ND.  No HSM
EXTREMITIES: No edema or calf pain, 2+ dorsalis pedis/ posterior
tibial pulses.
SKIN: No rashes/lesions, ecchymoses.
NEURO: A&Ox3. Appropriate. CN 2-12 grossly intact. Preserved
sensation throughout. 5/5 strength throughout. [**2-4**]+ reflexes,
equal BL. Normal coordination. Gait assessment deferred
PSYCH: Listens and responds to questions appropriately, pleasant

Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**3-30**]: prior myocardial infarction without inducible
ischemia to achieved low workload. Blunted heart rate response
to physiologic stress. Moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction. Moderate mitral regurgitation at rest. At
least moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.  EF 35%.
.
CT abd [**3-28**]:
1. Findings are consistent with perforated appendicitis with
surrounding phlegmonous or early abscess collection. Small
locules of extraluminal air are noted within the pelvic cavity
with free fluid and air also noted to track into the right
inguinal ring. Edema of the terminal ileum is presumed to be
reactive.
2. Known underlying emphysema and extensive atherosclerotic
disease.
3. Stable hypoattenuating pancreatic head lesions likely
representing side branch IPMT.

CT abd/pelvis [**2107-4-12**]:
Final Report
INDICATION: Perforated appendicitis being conservatively managed
with
antibiotics, please evaluate for fluid collections or
pseudocyst.

COMPARISON: [**2107-4-2**].

TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases
to the pubic
symphysis with oral contrast only but no intravenous contrast.
Coronal and
sagittal reformatted images are provided.

CONTRAST: Oral contrast only.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Large bilateral
pleural
effusions of low density are slightly increased from the CT of
[**4-2**].
There is adjacent atelectasis in the lower lobes bilaterally,
also more
marked. Focal calcifications along the left hemidiaphragm
(2A:11) are
unchanged and could represent sequelae of prior asbestos
exposure. The
aerated portions of the lungs appear unremarkable. Heart and
pericardium
appear unchanged.

Allowing for non-contrast technique, the liver, spleen, adrenal
glands, and
pancreas appear unremarkable, although it is noted that
hypodense pancreatic
lesions were seen on previous contrast examination that are not
evident on
today's study. Bilateral renal calcifications are most likely
vascular in
nature, and there is no evidence of hydronephrosis. Abdominal
aorta is normal
in caliber with mural calcification consistent with atheromatous
disease.

Since the previous examination of [**4-2**], the degree of
distention of the
proximal small bowel has decreased somewhat, and there is now
passage of
contrast into the colon without definite evidence of small bowel
obstruction.
Note is made of a filling defect in the distal esophagus, which
is hyperdense
and most likely represents a pill. Numerous additional similar
structures are
seen in the ascending colon and cecum, also most likely
representing pills.

Again seen is a distended appendix containing contrast and air
at its base
with periappendiceal stranding and inflammation as well as
extraluminal gas,
consistent with the patient's known appendiceal perforation. A
couple of very
small adjacent organized fluid collections are seen, the largest
in the right
lower quadrant measuring 1.8 x 2.3 cm (2A:61), probably
minimally decreased
from the previous examination and no longer containing gas as it
had at the
time of the prior scan. No new developing fluid collections are
identified.

Hyperdense material again seen within the non-distended
gallbladder possibly
representing stones or sludge.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: A left-sided fat-
and fluid-
containing inguinal hernia is again noted, slightly larger than
at the time of the previous study. Smaller right-sided fat- and
fluid-containing inguinal hernia is seen with the fluid
component decreased in size and no longer containing gas. A
Foley catheter is in place within the bladder which appears
otherwise unremarkable. Prostate and seminal vesicles, and
hyperdense prosthetic structures possibly representing
brachytherapy seeds, are unchanged. Rectum and sigmoid colon
appear unremarkable. A small collection in the right upper
pelvis is probably slightly decreased as previously described.
There is diffuse stranding throughout the subcutaneous tissues.
Bilateral femoral neck compression screws in unchanged
orientation.

BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative change of the lumbar spine again
noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. Slight decrease in size of small fluid collections adjacent
to the
patient's known perforated appendicitis, without evidence of
drainable
collections or new collections.
2. Decrease in previously present small bowel obstruction with
only mild
