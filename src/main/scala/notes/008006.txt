Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 783**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness, SOB, hypotension.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
.

History of Present Illness:
69 F h/o COPD (no home O2), recently admitted to [**Hospital **]
Hospital for ?COPD flare/PNA, rcently discontinued from her
steroid taper, who called EMS [**2160-8-13**] for weakness and dyspnea x
3 days. EMS found pt in mild respiratory distress, (HR 140, SBP
122/62, RR 22, 97% RA), and noting epigastric pain,
non-exertional, non-radiational exacerbated by deep inspiration,
a/w n/v/, diaphoresis or paplpitations. No change with foogd.
.
In ED VS=97.5 136 101/56 28 93%RA->97%3L, CXR showed no ACP,
however SBP subsequently dropped to 62/P, and pt given 3L NS.
Her SBP improved to 96/36 in ED, but she was admitted to MICU
[**3-14**] hypotension. Her respiratory distress was treated with
solumedrol IV, levaquin, and atrovent nebs.
.
In MICU, pt continued to receive IVF for hyptoension (SBP 70s on
admit), for total 8L positive at time of transfer. CTA was c/w
emphysema, no PE. [**Last Name (un) **] stim was performed which was normal, and
etiology of hypotension was felt to be [**3-14**] dehydration,
tachycardia [**3-14**] anxiety vs hypoxia. Epigastric pain had
resolved.
.
Of note pt was recently discharged from [**Hospital **] Hospital
(5-13-6/21)for SOB and chest congestion. She had previously
completed course of Ceftin prescribed by her PCP for acute
bronchitis without beneift. She was treated with solumedrol,
abx, and nebs (though pt insists they "screwed up my inhalers").
advair was added to her regimen, and pt was discharged home on a
steroid taper.

STUDIES:
[**2160-8-14**] CTA
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Emphysema. Increased interstitial markings consistent with
fibrosis with left upper lobe predominance.
.
[**2160-8-14**] TTE -
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad.
.
.
[**2160-8-14**] CXR: changes c/w COPD. no ACP.
.
EKG: initial EKG--sinus tach 140s, normal axis, normal
intervals. SI,qIII pattern. ST dep in I and II, that disappear
when the rate slows down to the 120s.


Brief Hospital Course:
# SOB/hypoxia
  Respiratory symptoms most likley due to COPD exacerbation. PE
and pneumonia unlikley given unremarkable CTA (which was c/w
emphysema).  Patient was treated with Prednisone, Atrovent, and
albuterol.  At discharge oxygen saturation was in the mid 90s
with 2L O2 by nasal canula.  On ambulation without oxygen
however, O2 sat declined to 87% and patient was discharged with
home O2.  At the request of her pulmonologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73361**],
she was set up to see Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 55834**] as an outpatient for
possible debulking surgery.  She was discharged on prednisone,
albuterol, and atrovent.
.
# tachycardia
Patient was experienced intermittent sinus tachycardia as high
as the 140s.  She was ruled out for MI, PE, and hyperthyroidism,
and this tachycardia persisted even once BP had stabilized.
Tachycardia also persisted when patient was off albuterol.  She
is on Cardizem as an oupatient, but this was held when patient
was hypotensive.  Once she was restarted on her home dose,
tachycardia resolved.
.
# hypotension
Etiology unclear of hypotension is unclear but may have been
related to adrenal insufficiency after recent steroid taper or
other medications.  Per husband, patient has confused her
medications in past. TTE unremarkable for cardiac etiology,
there were no signs of infection, and hypotension was fluid
responsive.  She was discharged on a steroid taper.  Lisinopril
was not restarted because blood pressure was low-normal and she
was instructed to follow-up with her PCP regarding further BP
management.
.
# hypothyroidism: maintained on synthroid, TFTs normal.
.
# abd pain/elevated LFTs.
Initially had elevated LFTs (ALT 214 AST 146).  AST trended
downwards but ALT did not.  Etiology of elevated LFTs is unclear
but may be related to hypotension.  Serologies for hepatitis A,
B, and C were negative.   Elevated LFTs should be followed as an
outpatient.
.
# osteoporosis: fosamax and evista for now were held while
inpatient.
.
# anemia
Baseline hematocrit was unknown (was 33.2 on [**2160-7-19**] @[**Location (un) **])
but was 40 on admission and dropped to 32 on HD1 but then
remained stable. This was thought to be due to aggressive
hydration.  She had no recent h/o melena or hematemesis and was
guaiac negative.
.
# anxiety: patient reported a long history of anxiety disorder,
but was unsure of her medication regimen.  She had feelings of
panic while in hospital and started klonipin 0.25 mg [**Hospital1 **].  She
was not discharged on this medication, and encouraged to follow
up with her primary care physician or [**Name Initial (PRE) **] psychiatrist.
