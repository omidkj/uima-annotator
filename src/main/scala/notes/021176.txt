Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with PCI


History of Present Illness:
34M w/ PMH sig for hypercholesterolemia and positive family
history who presents from an OSH after experiencing acute [**10-4**]
substernal chest pain, shortness of breath and diaphoresis.
.
His history begins about two years ago when he was admitted with
chest pain but was ruled out for MI by enzymes and exercise
MIBI. He had intermittent "indigestion". On the day of
admission, he developed sudden-onset substernal chest pain [**9-4**]
while he was speaking to a customer at work. He excused himself
from worked and presented to an OSH where he was found to have
STE V2-V6 and hyperacute T waves. Thrombolysis with TNK was
attempted but failed to relieve his pain. He was therefore
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for emergent percutaneous coronary
intervention.
.
Coronary angiography revelead a total occlusion of his distal
RCA which appeared old and a fresh thrombus in his mid-LAD. LCx
showed mild disease and LM was clean. A 3.5 cypher stent was
placed to the LAD and the patient was transferred to the CCU on
integrellin and an IABP.

Cardiac Catheterization:
1. Selective coronary angiography demonstrated two vessel
coronary
artery disease. The LMCA was without flow limiting disease. The
LAD was
totally occluded in the mid vessel. The diagonal branch was
without flow
limiting disease. The LCX and its two OM branches were without
flow
limiting disease. The RCA was a dominant vessel that had diffuse
disease
in the mid and distal vessel with a total occlusion in the
distal RCA.
2. Right heart catheterization demonstrated elevated right and
left
sided filling pressures with RVEDP of 20 mmHg and mean PCWP of
33 mmHg.
Cardiac output and index were 4.6 L/min and 2.3 L/min/m2
respectively.
3. Left ventriculogram deferred to reduce contrast load.
4. Successful primary PCI with stenting of the mid LAD with a
3.0x33mm
Cypher DES at 16 atms (See PTCA comments).
5. Successful placement of intra-aortic balloon pump in right
common
femoral artery.

Echocardiogram:
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed. Anterior, septal,
apical, distal
lateral, and distal inferior severe hypokinesis to akinesis iis
present. LVEF 30%
2. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
## Cardiac:
a) ischemia: Cardiac catheterization demonstrated two vessel
coronary
artery disease. The LMCA was without flow limiting disease. The
LAD was
totally occluded in the mid vessel. The diagonal branch was
without flow
limiting disease. The LCX and its two OM branches were without
flow
limiting disease. The RCA was a dominant vessel that had diffuse
disease
in the mid and distal vessel with a total occlusion in the
distal RCA.
There was successful primary PCI with stenting of the mid LAD
with a 3.0x33mm
Cypher DES at 16 atms and successful placement of intra-aortic
balloon pump in right common femoral artery. The pt did have
some CP after PCI but this was attributed to debris post-cath
and it resolved by the second day post-cath. His peak CE: [**4-17**]
CK 5297 Trop 11.11. He was monitored closely in the CCU and IABP
was removed without incident. He was started on ASA, plavix, and
metoprolol. ACEi was added when his blood pressure tolerated.
Prior to admission he was on zocor 40 and this was increased to
80 and zetia was added given his cholesterol panel. He was also
started on folate given his young age early coronary disease.
The pt should undergo a complete workup for hypercoaguability
given his early onset CAD and positive family history.
.
b) Pump: pt was initially supported with an IABP for afterload
reduction. Following its removal he was started on lisinopril
2.5. Echo showed an EF of 30% and thus he was anticoagulated
with coumadin and heparin gtt was used as a bridge. He was
discharged with an INR of 1.9 and will follow up on [**4-23**] with
Dr.[**Name (NI) 8664**] office to make sure his INR is therapeutic. He will
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and is currently searching for a new
PCP.
.
c) rhythm: Pt was slightly tachycardic with HR's in the 90's
even 3 days after his MI. This was felt to be secondary to
adrenergic drive. He was asymptomatic. Up-titration of his beta
blocker was restricted by his low BP. He was discharged with
metoprolol 37.5 twice daily with instructions that if he felt
dizzy he would only take 25mg twice daily. His PCP and
cardiologist may increase this medication further as tolerated.
The pt was also scheduled for an outpatient EP visit for
evaluation for an ICD given his low EF. He had a few PVC's but
no other events on telemetry in the days following his MI.
.
##[**Name (NI) **] Pt did spike a fever to 101 [**4-18**]. However, Ua was
negative, lungs remained clear, and Ucx and Bcx showed no
growth. After this one spike he remained afebrile and had no
symptoms.
.
