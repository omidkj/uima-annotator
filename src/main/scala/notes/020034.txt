Echo [**2166-9-15**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly-to-moderately depressed (ejection fraction 40
percent) secondary to severe hypokinesis of the inferior and
posterior walls. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
A&P 74 yom with htn, hyperchol, dm, angina, pvd, cva, and recent
gi bleed presented with [**Month/Day (2) **] at OSH.  Pt chest pain free on
presentation to [**Hospital1 **].

1) [**Name (NI) 7792**] - Pt symptom free on presentation to [**Hospital1 **].  Admitted
to a cardiac monitoring floor.  Pt was switched to metoprolol
100 [**Hospital1 **] inpatient (pt taking atenelol 100 qd, outpt), and
continued on asa and statin.  ACEI was also started on
admission.  He was continued on nitro gtt and heparin gtt, and
cardiac enzymes were cycled.  Integrillin was not started given
pt's INR of 3.1 on presentation, recent history of GI bleed,
Age, recent CVA and no symptoms on presentation, here.  Cardiac
enzymes on presentation were CK 394, CK,MB 29, Trop T 0.90.
Enzymes were cycled, results above.  Pt experienced an episode
of SOB on HD#1, nitro drip was titrated up and pt remained
symptom free there after.  Plan was to have pt undergo cardiac
cath once INR was <1.6.  HD #1 INR 2.6, HD#2 INR 2.1.  On HD#3
INR was 1.5 and pt underwent a radial approach cardiac cath
since he had non palpable lower extremity pulses.  Pt was noted
to have 3 vd, and Left main disease and was scheduled for CABG
[**2166-9-19**].

2)  HTN - On admission, HR 81, BP119/59.  Pt was started on ACEI
and BB was continued.  Pt's htn remained well controlled on this
regimen.

3)  PNA - Pt with caugh for a few months and no change, however,
CXR with patchy opacity in RLL.  Pt was started on Levofloxacin
for CAP x 7 days.

4)  DM - Glyburide was held inpatient and pt was started on ISS.


5)  Gi bleed - Per pt gi bleed 6 wks ago, [**Name (NI) 653**] pcp's office
on HD #1.  Spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3314**] regarding pt's recent GI
Bleed.  He said that pt had an occult bleed in [**5-9**].  At the
time his hct was 24 on presentation and after receiving 2 units
prbc, it was 31 on discharge.  He upper endoscopy which revealed
chronic gastritis, and a [**Date Range 2792**] which revealed
diverticulosis.  There were no neoplastic lesions identified.
Of not pt's hct was 44 in [**2-6**].  Pt was guiac positive on
admission, however did not have any episodes of BRBPR or melena.

6) Anemia - on presentation hct at 28.9, pt received 2 units of
PRBC during this admission.  Iron studies revealed a microcytic
anemia, mcv 74.  Iron deficiency anemia in a 74 yom with 40 lbs
wt loss over 4 months is concerning for Colon Ca.  However per
phone conv with pcp, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 2792**] 2 mos ago was negative for
neoplastic lesions.  PCP should evaluate this further.  Pt may
require abdominal and or chest ct scan to evaluate for
malignancy.

7) Wt loss - TSH was within normal limits.  Pt also underwent a
CT scan of thorax, abdomen, pelvis which was remarkable for
heavy vascular calcifications and pulmonary nodules <5mm in
lungs.

8) Dispo - Pt was transferred to Cardiothorasic Surgery Service
on [**2166-9-19**].

9) CABG x 3 on [**2166-9-19**] with LIMA -> LAD, SVG -> OM and SVG ->
Diag.  OR course uneventful with total cardio-pulmonary bypass
time 87 minutes and cross-clamp time 70 minutes.  He was
transferred to the ICU with a HR of 89 in NSR, MAP 71, CVP 5,
with neosynephrine, milrinone, and propofol drips.

He was extubated on the evening of his operative day.  Chest
tubes were removed on POD 2 and cardiac pading wires were
removed on POD 3.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] experienced episodes of confusion and agitation
throughout his recovery requiring 1:1 supervision until [**9-26**]
when his mental status cleared and he was not felt to be a
danger to himself.  His mental status continues to be labile
with some benign forgetfulness.

He had been initially in NSR that changed to atrial fibrillation
on the morning of [**9-21**] (POD 2).  This was controlled with IV
metropolol, IV amiodarone bolus, and IV amiodarone drip.  He
continued in and out of afib through [**9-23**] at which time he was
started on coumadin and IV heparin for anticoagulation.  On
[**9-25**] he converted to NSR and was changed from IV to PO
amiodarone.  However, he again experienced bursts of afib on
[**9-26**] for which the EP service was consulted.  Their
recommendations included IV and PO beta-blockers for rate
control, PO amiodarone, and repletion of electrolytes (all
already being done).  Further recommendations were to continue
anticoagulation and follow-up appointment in 6 weeks.

Members of the physical therapy service began seeing Mr. [**Known lastname **]
on [**9-24**] and continued to see him throughout his hospital stay.
