HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis:  Patient was admitted to the MICU,
managed with IV insulin drip and IV fluids, which resolved.
Initial triggers unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] has a history of poor
glycemic control and diabetic ketoacidosis with last
admission in [**2139-8-24**].

The [**Last Name (un) **] endocrinologists were consulted and over the
course of his hospitalization, had fine tuned his diabetes
regimen to Glargine 12 units at night standing dose with a
Humalog insulin-sliding scale.

2. Neurologic:  This patient had a question of seizure-like
activity, twitching, and apnea when called out from the MICU
post hemodialysis on [**11-4**].  His electrolytes had
shown a low ionized calcium of 0.99.  Was in the process of
getting repleted.  Eventually normalized.

Neuro was following.  LP was unrevealing.  Normal EEG.  Tox
screen negative.  Unable to have a MRI due to metal in his
legs external fixator.  He was originally started on
Dilantin, but then was felt that Dilantin was not needed as
this was probably not a seizure disorder likely metabolic.
Additionally, the patient's glucose was low during the time
of the twitching activity.

3. End-stage renal disease:  Failing transplant.  Patient is
on prednisone 5 mg a day and will be for life to prevent
transplant rejection.  Patient has undergone several
hemodialysis sessions and should be continued 3x a week.

4. Chronic osteomyelitis:  Patient completed his six week
course of Vancomycin and ceftaz from [**9-26**] to [**11-8**], and patient is to followup with Orthopedics for removal
of the external fixator.  Pain control with OxyContin and prn
oxycodone.  Additionally, this patient was found to have a
left rib fracture, ribs #9 and 10 pain control and calcium
supplementation.

5. Hypertension:  Patient is hypertensive upon admission.
Now is running in the 130s.  Patient was restarted on
amlodipine 5 mg two times a day and is stable.  Next
medication to add if needed would be metoprolol.

6. Anemia chronic:  Patient was on Epogen dosing, however,
has been D/C'd per Renal.

7. Depression:  Patient was stable on his home medication of
Celexa.

8. Fluids, electrolytes, and nutrition:  Patient is on a
renal diabetic diet, hemodialysis for repletion and
supplements.
