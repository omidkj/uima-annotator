Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. PCI
2. IABP
3. s/p right SFA patching and thrombectomy
4. Swan-ganz catheter right groin and right IJ


History of Present Illness:
66 yom p/w 10 days increasing SOB and LE edema. In ED, found to
have ST elevations (V2-V4) on EKG. ACS regimen started. Dropped
pressure with NTG was then placed on levophed and dopamine d/t
him being in cardiogenic shock.
.
In ED, went into SVT on dopamine was cardioverted and intubated
with  laceration of the soft palate. Was also placed on insulin
drip for BS 900's.
.
In cath lab, saw a lot of disease but did not intervene since no
culprit lesion was identified. Trop 3.73. Echo showed global
hypokinesis, IABP implanted. Dopamine was changed to levophed
gtt.
.
While on the CCU floor, patient was switched to dobutamine and
dopamine with the plan to eventually add nitro gtt. Diuresis not
option given DKA (+ketoacids in urine) and elevated Cr.

Sugars improved from 400's to 300's. Anticoagulatns were held
and ENT repaired soft palate lac. Right foot became noticeabley
cold and cyanotic. Peripheral pulses had been dopplerable
however became undetectable by doppler on right up to the
proximal groin, femoral pulse still intact. Decision was made to
remove balloon pump. Heparin bolus and gtt started overnight.
Vascular surgery consulted.

IMAGING:
[**2190-10-30**] ECHO
There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with only
modest sparing of the inferior wall. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed (EF 10-15%). Mild to
moderate ([**11-29**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2190-10-30**]: Cath Results:
- left dominant anatomy with three vessel disease with a tubular
50% LMCA lesion. The LAD was diffusely diseased proximally to
occluded totally just after the S1. There is some
collateralisation of the LAD. The Cx is dominant with a distal
80% lesion. The RCA is non dominant and had proximal critical
stenosis.
- There was severe hypokinesia in the inferio wall. The rest
of the segments and the apex were akinetic.
- Hemodynamics showed central aortic hypotnesion while intubated
and on vasopressors. the filling pressures were markedly
elevated with LVEDP at 40mmHg, PCWP could not be obtained (RVEDP
was 28 mm Hg) CI was depressed at 1.4

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2190-11-7**] 7:55 AM
FINDINGS: The endotracheal tube continues to be 5.5 cm above the
carina. The NG tube tip is in the stomach. There is a right IJ
line with tip in the SVC. There is dense retrocardiac opacity
that could be due to volume loss/infiltrate/effusion. There is
increased hazy opacity projecting over the right lower lung that
likely represents an effusion layering posteriorly although an
infiltrate can also be present. Compared to the prior film,
there has been some interval clearing of the interstitial edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
66 yom presents in cardiogenic shock s/p acute MI and DKA. Cath
showed 3VD and echo showed EF of [**9-11**]%. Intubated and IABP
placed. Had decreased perfusion to R LE, removed IABP to OR for
patching of SFA and thrombectomy. Patient subsequently had runs
of afib w/ RVR and then VF multiple times requiring
defibrillation. Patient loaded on IV amiodarone and continuous
drip. [**2190-11-7**] Went into vfib and was DNR and passed away.
.
# R LE decreased perfusion: IABP was discontinued and taken to
OR [**2190-10-31**] for SFA patch and thrombectomy. Now with dopplerable
dorsalis pedis pulse. On heparin drip perioperatively then
discontinued.
.
# Cardiac:
ischemic: Cath showed diffuse disease no clear stentable target.
Trop-*T* peaked 11.28. Cardiac [**Doctor First Name **] were consulted and would
consider ht transplant when improved.

pump: Pt w/severely depressed global LV systolic function with
regional wall motion abnormalities. Upon presentation, difficult
to treat diabetic ketoacidosis because requires fluid
resuscitation however in setting of cardiogenic shock, we were
unable to aggressively increase intravascular volume. Started on
dopamine and dobutamine drip. Patient returned from PACU on
levophed, dopamine and dobutamine drips. Patient's DKA resolved
and a lasix drip was started because of overload, elevated PA
diastolic pressure (33) and CVP(17). Patient was weaned off
dopamine and dobutamine and sedation. Patient was continued on
lasix drip and added aldactone and diuryl to improve diuresis
since he was net 4-5 liters positive over length of stay.
Attempted to wean patient weaned off levophed however still
required some pressor support.
.
rhythm: Patient had runs of afib with RVR to 140s. Attempt at
cardioversion x 1 at 200J but did not convert. Pt was loaded
w/1g amiodarone gtt, started amio 400mg PO BID and 1g digoxin,
start digoxin 0.125mg PO QD in am [**2190-11-3**]. Patient then required
5 defibrillated shocks 360J for pulseless VT that would not stay
in sinus rhythm. He was loaded with 300mg IV amiodarone then
continued on 1mg/min amio drip for 6hrs then 0.5mg/min
indefinitely. Digoxin was discontinued.
.
# Acidosis: Combination of decreased perfusion (lactic acidosis)
and diabetic ketoacidosis with now closing gap. Used IABP to
increase cardiac perfusion and decrease preload, now
discontinued d/t difficulties with r LE perfusion. Tight insulin
control with insulin gtt and boluses as needed to decrease
ketoacids. Started D5W and NPH 20U after FS 160 to prevent
hypoglycemia and widely varying BS's. Anion gap acidosis
resolved. continued insulin gtt and tube feeds as tolerated.
.
# ID: persistent low grade fevers concerning for infection. On
vanco/levo day #[**6-3**], broad-spectrum antibiotics in setting of
possible sepsis. Flagyl d/c on [**11-1**]. Changed coverage to [**Hospital 23678**]
hospital acquired pna -> vanco/zosyn day 2, dc levo ([**11-5**]).
Vanco dosed Q24 given decrease CrCl. Dc'd swan right neck and
send tip for culture -> triple lumen placed. Sent surveillance
cultures daily/CIS.
.
# Mouth laceration: s/p packing of lac x3days, packing was
removed and required re-packing [**2190-11-3**] for another 3 days. ENT
was following.
.
# Intubation: Continued intub
