Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2290**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea/Vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Truncal vagotomy, antrectomy, retrocolic Billroth II
gastrojejunostomy and omentectomy


History of Present Illness:
This is an 82 yo F transfered for workup of a stomach mass. She
was admitted to OSH on [**10-26**] with 5 weeks of nausea and foreful
brownish/blackish emesis, appx 1 pint/day. She associated this
with recently starting warfarin, but symptoms returned even
after stopping warfarin. She had no prior issues with nausea or
vomiting. Also with 8-10# wt loss over this time.

At OSH, noted to be in rapid afib. HR improved with IVF and dilt
drip (now in 80s-90s). Warfarin was held and she was continued
on enoxaparin. Underwent EGD which showed gastric mass. Biopsy
performed with pathology "inconclusive". NG tube was refused (pt
does not recall this). Surgery was consulted and recommended CT
scan, with results below. She did require blood transfusions for
anemia, as well. She was also on levofloxacin, then bactrim, for
pansens E coli UTI. Sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible EUS with bx, and
likely surgical intervention. Vitals from transfer call-in: T:
AF BP: 132/91 HR: 80s-90s RR: 20 O2 Sat: 99% 2 L/min O2.
.
On the floor, patient notes that she has been on a regular diet,
but not eating much solid. Her nausea is bad in the am, with
spitting up phlegm, but abates after ~1pm.

   HELICOBACTER PYLORI ANTIBODY TEST (Final [**2185-11-4**]):
      NEGATIVE BY EIA.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
.
[**2185-11-4**] ECG: Atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 126.
Low voltage in the standard leads. Early transition. No other
diagnostic abnormality. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
.
[**2185-11-3**] EUS: Large amount of yellow liquid with large solid
particles were noted in the stomach, it could not be completely
suctioned out due to the large particles occluding suction
channel An irregular, circumferential, friable mass was found in
the antrum causing obstruction of the gastric outlet Cold
forceps biopsies were performed for histology after EUS
examination and FNA. EUS was performed using a radial
echoendoscope at 7.5 MHz frequency, however, a full examination
was not able to be performed due to the presence of large amount
of fluid in the stomach: There was marked thickening of the
stomach wall in the antrum, demarcation between mucosa,
submucosa and muscularis propria was lost. These findings are
consistent with an infiltrative type of gastric neoplasm, such
as: linitis plastica, lymphoma, amyloidosis, syphillis, etc.
Celiac axis was examined and no lympadenopathy was noted.

[**2185-11-19**] CXR:
Left lower lobe opacity is a combination of pleural effusion and
probably
atelectasis. This is unchanged since [**11-4**]. Small right
pleural
effusion is probably unchanged. The right lobe otherwise is
clear. There is
no evidence of pneumothorax. Multiple thoracic vertebral body
compression
fractures are noted.

Final Report
FINDINGS:
There is a left trans-subclavian PICC in place with the tip in
the junction ofSVC and right atrium.
There is no sign of acute or chronic pulmonary embolism or
pulmonary
hypertension.
There is no mediastinal, hilar or axillary adenopathy. There are
diffuse
three-vessel coronary calcifications. Cardiac [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] are
unremarkable.
Aorta demonstrates mild atherosclerotic burden without aneurysm
with
conventional branching of arch vessels.
There is a left pleural effusion. There is consolidation in the
left lower
lobe adjacent to the pleural effusion which may be due to
compressive
atelectasis versus pneumonia. There is a smaller right pleural
effusion.
There is a 3.2 cm bulla in the right middle lobe. No nodule or
mass.
Bronchi and trachea are unremarkable.
There are compression fractures in the T8 and T9 vertebra with
approximately 50% height loss without breach of posterior cortex
or retropulsion, stable from [**2185-11-4**]. There are also
significant degenerative changes involving the right shoulder
joint.
IMPRESSION:
No acute or chronic pulmonary embolism.
Left pleural effusion with adjacent consolidation, atelectasis
versus
pneumonia.
T8 and T9 vertebral body compression fractures with 50% height
loss, stable
from [**2185-10-12**].


Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 82 yo F transferred for workup of a stomach mass,
which presented with nausea and vomiting. The patient was
initially admitted to general medicine, but was transferred to
the Acute Care Service for a planned subtotal gastrectomy.
Subsequently, a truncal vagotomy, antrectomy, retrocolic
Billroth II, gastro-jejunostomy and omentectomy was performed on
[**2185-11-8**]. The patient was transferred to the surgical
intensive care unit post-operatively, where she remained stable.
 The patient was transferred to the surgical [**Hospital1 **] on
Post-operative day #4.

# Gastric mass: presented with mass from OSH.  Partially
obstructing, concerning for malignancy.  EUS performed on [**11-4**]
confirmed mass, with concern for linitis plastica vs. lymphoma.
Was deemed H. pylori negative.  Biopsies returned positive for
intestinal metaplasia without any signs of overt malignancy.
NGT was eventually needed for the pt as she began vomiting
gastric secretions on [**2185-11-6**].  The patient
