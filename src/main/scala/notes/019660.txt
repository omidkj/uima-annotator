Admission Date: [**2153-8-24**]        Discharge Date: [**2153-8-26**]

Date of Birth:  [**2094-6-4**]        Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiac Surgery


ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  Mobile atheroma in ascending aorta.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Mobile atheroma in ascending aorta.

Hypertension.

History of seizure disorder.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Large right cerebellar stroke.

Severe peripheral vascular disease.

PROCEDURE:  None.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59 year old
female with a past medial history significant for
hypertension, seizure disorder since age 3 with last seizure
2 years ago, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity,
pneumonia with last episode in [**2150**], questionable lung nodule
with negative biopsy in [**2148**], and prior tobacco use who
presented to [**Hospital3 **] on [**2153-8-20**] after 2 days of
blurred vision, nausea/emesis, and unsteadiness on her feet.
The patient denied any dysarthria, headache or focal weakness
associated with her presenting symptoms.  The patient was
seen and evaluated in the Emergency Room at  [**Hospital3 **] and
found to have a systolic blood pressure in the 200's with a
CT scan showing a large right cerebellar infarct.  The
patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital3 14565**] and was seen in consultation by cardiology and
neurology.  A magnetic resonance angiogram of the neck and
brain was done which showed an acute right cerebellar infarct
as well
as 70-80 percent stenosis of both internal carotid arteries
with severe atherosclerotic disease at the carotid
bifurcations.  A TEE was done on [**8-24**] which showed a mobile
atheroma in her ascending aorta as well as an EF of 58
percent.  The patient was started on Heparin drip in
consultation with neurology.  In corroboration with the
neurology service and the cardiology service, the decision was
made to transfer the patient to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for further evaluation for possible surgical
treatment of this mobile atheroma.  The patient arrived at
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] on [**2153-8-24**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

Pneumonia.

Lung nodule with negative biopsy in [**2148**].

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Seizure disorder since age 3, last seizure 2 years ago.

Peripheral vascular disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Anal fissure resection.

Lung biopsy.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1. Primidone 250 mg po 4 times a day.
2. Aspirin 160 mg once a day.
3. Slow-K 10 mg once a day.
4. Norvasc 10 mg po once a day.
5. Carbatrol XL 300 mg po once a day.
6. Pravachol 20 m po once a day.
7. Lopressor 50 mg po 3 times a day.
8. Diovan 160 mg po twice a day.
9. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg po once a day.
10.      Levaquin 250 mg po once a day.
11.      Hydralazine 25 mg po 3 times a day.


SOCIAL HISTORY:  Prior tobacco use.  Quit in [**2148**].  No ETOH
use.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 10.5, hematocrit
39.4 and platelet count 238. Chem-7 was unremarkable. PTT on
admission was 74.3.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile with heart
rate in the 70's and blood pressure of 239/65 on admission,
she is saturating 95 percent on room air.
HEENT:  Her face is symmetric.  Tongue was mobile.  Pupils
are equal and reactive bilaterally. She had no carotid
bruits.
CARDIOVASCULAR:  Heart was regular.
CHEST:  Lungs were clear.  She had a well healed scar on the
right side of her neck just lateral to the sternal notch.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, obese, nontender.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm. She had 1+ pitting edema.  Her DP and PT
were dopplerable on the right. She had a left PT that was
dopplerable.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit on the Cardiac Surgery
service.  She was seen in consultation by neurology. They
agreed with heparinization and requested a repeat magnetic
resonance imaging which was done.  It did not show any
evidence of new bleed.  Her blood pressure was controlled with
Nipride drip and an A line was placed.  The echocardiogram was
reviewed and it did show a 6 to 7 mm mobile atheroma in the
ascending aorta.  A multi- disciplinarian review of the
findings was done. Given the patient's severe carotid disease,
peripheral vascular disease, calcified aorta, and new
cerebellar infarct it was felt that the patient was at higher
risk for a new stroke than for embolization of this mobile
atheroma.  It was also felt that given her severe carotid
disease and vertebral disease that there was really no proof
that this atheroma was the source of her cerebellar infarct.
It was therefore decided to medically manage the patient with
heparinization as well as Coumadin and blood pressure control
with systolic in the 140 to 160 range.

Of note the patient did have an episode on the morning of
[**8-26**] where she was more somnolent. A stat head CT without
contrast was obtained and the patient did not have any new
bleed. She was seen by neurology who felt that she should
have a metabolic work up for the source of her somnolence and
blood cultures were sent as well as a repeat urinalysis.  The
patient had been on Levaquin, at transfer for an E. Coli
urinary tract infection and is continued on this throughout
her hospital at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3867**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. Also of
note the patient did have a bout of tachycardia with a heart
rate in the low 100's.  An EKG done at that time showed some
deepening of her ST depression laterally.  It was thought to
be secondary to strain.  Her heart rate was controlled with
intravenous Lopressor.  On repeat EKG she did have still have
some deepening of ST in the lateral leads as well as flipped
T waves in V2 and V3.  It was therefore decided to send
cardiac enzymes to rule the patient out.

As part of an infectious workup for mental status changes a
chest x-ray was done on the morning of [**8-26**].  It showed
mild congestive heart failure,  The patient was given Lasix 40
mg IV with little response.  The first set of cardiac enzymes
did come back negative.

In discussion with the family they wished to have the patient
transferred closer to home.  Given the fact she is not
going to have any surgical intervention this plan to transfer
the patient was agreed upon by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **], and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 5017**], cardiologist at [**Hospital3 **].  In agreement
with the hospitalist who had originally admitted the patient
at [**Hospital3 **] it was decided to transfer Mrs. [**Known lastname 58592**] back
there, closer to her friends and family.  She was stable on
transfer.
