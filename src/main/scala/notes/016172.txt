History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**] is a 73-year-old woman with severe and diffuse
tracheobronchomalacia. Her main symptomatology is marked
dyspnea. She had recently undergone full evaluation with our TBM
protocol, including dyspnea score, pulmonary function testing,
6-minute walk, dynamic bronchoscopy and dynamic airway CT
scanning. This confirmed the presence of her severe malacia and
its effect on her symptomatology. She underwent a recent
stenting trial and had an excellent response to the stent in
terms of her dyspnea though, as is often seen, she developed a
stent-related infection, and this needed to be removed shortly
thereafter.

Past Medical History:
Pulmonary embolus in [**2122**] and [**2135**], status post IVC filter and
Coumadin therapy, esophageal surgery in [**2122**], glaucoma, fracture

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**] was admitted on [**2137-9-13**] for
tracheobronchomalacia. She received a tracheoplasty and
bilateral bronchoplasty on the same day. Estimated blood loss
for the procedure was 250cc. The patient tolerated the procedure
well and was transferred to the ICU following the procedure. She
was initially on Neosynephrine for pressure support which was
weaned off that night. She was extubated in the ICU with mild
respiratory distress noted. She was transferred to the floor on
POD #3 in good condition. She was discharged on [**2137-9-20**] and
planning to return on [**2137-9-23**] for a bronchoscopy.

Neuro: Pt was on an epidural for pain control after her surgery.
The pt was started on PCA dilaudid on POD #3 in addition to her
epidural for pain control. The epidural and her PCA were
discontinued on POD #4 and she was started on oral percocet. She
was alert and oriented throughout her stay.

CV: The patient started complaining of chest pressure on POD #5
which resolved with sublingual nitroglycerin. Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**] remained
in sinus rhythm throughout her stay.

Resp: Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**] was extubated in the ICU with mild respiratory
distress noted on POD #1. On POD #1, Ms. [**Known lastname 1968**] was put on a
facemask for PaO2 in the 60s. She was started on BiPap overnight
on POD #1. She was also started on Advair, albuterol and
atrovent nebulizer and encourage to use her incentive spirometer
at this time. On POD #3, the pt was put on CPAP via her home
machine at 10 L/min. Pt was weaned off of daytime O2 by POD #6
with O2 saturations around 96%.

GI: Pt complained of nausea on POD #7 and was given zofran with
good effect.

FEN: Pt was started on a clear diet in the ICU. She was advanced
to a soft regular diet. Pt was given several doses of lasix
during her inpatient stay to ensure adequate diuresis and keep
improving her respiratory status.

Renal: Pt was transferred to ICU with a foley catheter in place.
In the ICU, on POD #2, the pt had decreased urinary output and
was given a 250cc bolus of NS. The foley was discontinued on POD
#4. MS. [**Known lastname 1968**] continued to have adequate urinary output with no
dysuria.

Heme: Pt was started on a heparin drip on POD #4 for a PTT
between 50-70. She was started on her home regimen of warfarin
on POD #5. Before being discharged home, we started her on
Lovenox and informed her not to take her warfarin until after
her bronchoscopy on [**2137-9-23**].

Endo: Pt was given Synthroid for history of thyroid nodules.

TLD: The pt had a chest tube after surgery which was removed on
POD #4.

Wound: The surgical wounds remained clean, dry and intact
throughout her stay.

Musculoskeletal: The pt complained of band-like chest pressure
on POD #6 which was relieved by ibuprofen and using her
incentive spirometer. Physical therapy assessed the pt on POD #4
and determined by POD #5 that the patient was near her baseline
status in endurance and pulmonary hygeine.

The patient was discharged on [**2137-9-20**] with stable vital signs,
afebrile and in good condition.
