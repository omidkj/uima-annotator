Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Placement of 2 pleurex catheters


History of Present Illness:
86F history of DM2, HTN, HLD, cardiac problem, transferred from
[**Name (NI) **]. Pt presented with one month of breathing difficulty,
weight loss, cough, decreased apetite getting progressively
worse over time. Family trie to bring pt in earlier but she
refused to go to hospital. Last night pt became acute more SOB
and family called ambulance and pt brought to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. At
[**Hospital1 **] found to have WBC 44, HR 170's in A fib, lactate=4;
concern for possible malignant process and ? PE. Got dilt 30mg
PO and 10mg IV for HR, which improved. Also got 4L IVF. LENI
showed R DVT. Got head CT which showed nothing acute. Deferred
CTA chest due to elevated Cr (Cr 1.8). Started on heparin gtt
for DVT and concern for PE. Got azithro and ceftriaxone at
[**Hospital1 **].
During transport pt developed worsened rales/crackles possibly
secondary to 4 L IVF given.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were: 65, RR 32, 128/59, 97% 15L
NRB. ECG showed AFib with RVR. Patient was started on a nitro
gtt, heparin gtt, given vancomycin/zosyn, and placed on BiPAP
for resp distress which didnt tolerate. Labs were notable for a
lactate of 8.5, WBC count 49.3, INR 1.6 and Cr of 1.8. CXR: air
fluid level abscess in lung. Patient was initially trialed on
BiPAP, did not tolerate, and thus was intubated (straight
forward intubation).
Placed R IJ. CVP=13.
Lactate rose to 10 and concern for gut ischemia.
CTA chest and torso: No PE, revealed multiple abscess in L lung-
Rim enhancing fluid collection. Multiple hypodensisities in
kidney and liver suggestive of embolic infectious process.
in ED given: Vanco, zosyn, flagyl.
Thoracics consult: Poor surgical candidate. Recc drainage per IR
right now.
K=6-->insulin/D50, Kayexlate.
Gave 1 UPRBC for elevated lactate.
ED attempted to call family several times to give update, never
got through.
.
On arrival to the MICU, pt is intubated, sedated, on Levo 0.2
and Dopamine 8. Had family meeting with son and 3 grandchildren.
Family very tearful, as of now they request FULL code but will
continue to discuss goals of care. They report this pt is usualy
active at baseline, ambulatory, takes care of her great
grandchildren.


Past Medical History:
Dm2
HTN
HLD
Cardiac process- seen at [**Hospital 1263**] hospital, family is not sure
what process this is.


Social History:
Lives with son, normally active at baseline and babysits
grandchildren. Ambulatory. Rarely admitted to the hospital. No
history of smoking or drug use.


Family History:
 no cancers.

Vitals:T 98.1, HR 83, BP 110/51, A fib, 98% on AC FiO2 40, TV
350, F 20, PEEP 5, MV 8.2.  IVF in: 6L plus 1 PRBC. UO: 230 in
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and 180 in [**Hospital1 18**] ED.
General: sedated
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
CV: irregular rate, no mrg.

Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no organomegaly
GU: foley
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema

Pertinent Results:
Cytology [**2162-3-29**]
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
Acellular specimen with bacterial overgrowth;
Correlate with microbiology report.

ECG Study Date of [**2162-3-29**]  2:29:44 AM
The rhythm is regular and most likely a junctional escape rhythm
at 60 beats per minute without clear atrial activity. Delayed R
wave transition. No previous tracing available for comparison.
Possible prior anteroseptal
myocardial infarction.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2162-3-29**] 2:45 AM
FINDINGS:

There is extensive opacification of the left hemithorax with an
air-fluid
level identified superiorly. These findings are representative
of a large
mass, possibly abscess in a fissure. Less likely would be a
large hiatal
hernia. There is rightward shift of normally midline structures.
Otherwise, the right hemithorax appears clear. No acute
fractures are identified. A dedicated chest CT is recommended
for further evaluation

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2162-3-29**] at 12:03:01 PM      FINAL

The left atrium is elongated. No thrombus/mass is seen in the
body of the left atrium. The right atrium is markedly dilated.
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The
estimated right atrial pressure is at least 15 mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is unusually small. Regional left ventricular wall motion
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle.
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility. There is
abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular volume overload. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade

CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST Study Date of [**2162-3-29**] 3:05 AM
IMPRESSION:

1. Multilobulated large left hemithorax pleural empyema with
foci of gas
noted. Given the foci of gas the differential includes recent
instrumentation
versus infection with a gas-forming organism versus a
bronchopleural fistula.

2. Multiple hypodense areas are also visualized throughout
bilateral
nonenlarged kidneys. These findings may be representative of
multiple cysts but a superinfectious process with multiple
abscesses cannot be excluded.

3. Small subsegmental right upper lobe pulmonary emboli.

4. There is mild gallbladder wall edema and mottled apparance of
the liver
are likely due to congestive hepatopathy.

5. Endotracheal tube with the tip at the level of the carina.
Retraction by
2cm is recommended.

6. Bilateral small pleural effusions.

7 . Severe cardiomegaly.
