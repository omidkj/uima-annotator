Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the ICU and on HD 1, she developed
respiratory distress and was intubated for ~10 hours. A central
line was placed for hemodynamic monitoring. She was extubated
later in the evening without issue. She likely had decreased
respiratory drive, became hypercarbic and developed respiratory
distress. Her white count was in the 20's with worsening
abdominal pain and empiric vancomycin and Zosyn were started. GI
was consulted for ERCP for presumed cholangitis. They deferred
ERCP given her acute respiratory distress. On HD 2 Cipro was
added for worsening white count (30's) for double coverage. ERCP
was planned but aborted in the evening given ERCP's concern for
another process other than cholangitis. CT scan of the abdomen
revealed a peripancreatic fluid collection. However by HD 3, her
white count, amylase and lipase were decreasing so ERCP was
again deferred. After discussion between the surgery and GI
attending the decision was made to proceed with ERCP.

She has required nasal oxygen during her hospital stay, her
saturations on [**3-16**] liters/min have been 96-98%. She is receiving
scheduled nebulizer treatments and her home medications were
restarted.

Geriatric medicine also followed along during her stay given her
age and other comorbidities. Several medications recommendations
were made pertaining to her medications. It was felt that Megace
and Marinol were contributing to her drowsiness and so these
were stopped.

She would later be started on a diet, advancing slowly and her
TPN was stopped. She is now tolerating a regular diet with
minimal abdominal pain.

Her antibiotics were eventually stopped and her PICC line
removed. She was evaluated by Physical therapy and is being
recommended to return to rehab after her acute hospital stay.
