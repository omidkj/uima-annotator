Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 943**]
Chief Complaint:
hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD: [**2119-7-11**]

History of Present Illness:
52y/o M with history of HCC (s/p Cyberknife, on sorafenib
therapy), cirrhosis c/b portal HTN, tumor thrombosis in right
posterior portal vein, gastroesophageal varices, and inguinal
hernia who was transferred from [**Hospital Ward Name 516**] Endoscopy Suite
after having found clot in fundus of stomach on EGD.
.
History was mainly obtained via family and Hepatology team who
stated that patient was in USOH however yesterday developed
hematemesis with subsequent tarry stools. Patient's family
notified hepatology providers who arranged for patient to have
EGD done today, which revealed a clot in the fundus of the
stomach (in the area of the prior varix). Given these findings,
patient was directly admitted to the ICU for close monitoring
with Octreotide and PPI drips. Prior to transfer, patietn was
afebrile, BP [**9-/2068**], HR 90, satting 95% on room air.
.
Of note patient was noted to have gastroesophageal varices in
[**2-/2119**] un subsequently underwent banding of the esophageal
varices in 03/[**2118**].
.
In the MICU, patient was resting comfortably however was
complaining of abdominal discomfort.

                            **FINAL REPORT [**2119-7-12**]**

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2119-7-12**]):
      MIXED BACTERIAL FLORA ( >= 3 COLONY TYPES), CONSISTENT
WITH SKIN
      AND/OR GENITAL CONTAMINATION.
.
Imaging:
RUQ ULTRASOUND ([**2119-7-11**]):
FINDINGS: The hepatic architecture is coarsened in appearance
and an
ill-defined mass is seen in the right hepatic lobe measuring
approximately 6.3
x 5.5 x 5.5 cm and corresponding to known HCC. No biliary
dilatation is seen
and the common duct measures 0.5 cm. No gallstones are
identified. The
spleen is enlarged measuring 15.9 cm. A small amount of ascites
is seen in
the abdomen.

DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color Doppler and pulse-wave Doppler images
were
obtained. The main and left portal veins are patent with
hepatopetal flow.
Again, no flow could be identified within the right portal vein,
which was
identified as thrombosed on the prior CT of [**2119-7-6**].
Appropriate flow
is seen in the main, right and left hepatic arteries, IVC,
middle hepatic
vein, and left hepatic vein.

IMPRESSION:
1. Thrombosed right portal vein. Hepatopetal flow is seen in the
main and
left portal veins. Appropriate flow in the hepatic arteries and
middle and
left hepatic veins. Note is made that the right hepatic vein was
not
identified.
2. Small amount of ascites.
3. Coarsened hepatic architecture with redemonstration of right
hepatic lobe
HCC.
4. Splenomegaly.
.
ECHO ([**7-12**]):
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). A mid-cavitary
gradient is identified. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric LVH with a small LV cavity and
hyperdynamic LV systolic function. Consequently there is a
mid-cavitary gradient of 30mm Hg during systole. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal.
.
CTA CHEST ([**7-12**]):
IMPRESSION:

Bilateral segmental artery glue embolism. No filling defects
within the main
or lobar pulmonary arteries.

Mild to moderate right pleural effusion.

Known cirrhotic liver with incompletely imaged right lobe
hypodense lesion and
an ill-defined hyperdense area in the right lobe which is likely
perfusion
abnormality. Moderate-to-large ascites.

Hyperdense material in the gastric wall is consistent with the
history of glue
embolization.

Impression:	Varices at the middle third of the esophagus
Varices at the fundus
Blood in the second part of the duodenum (injection)
