Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 49 yom h/o Facotr V leiden deficiency and fhx
hemachromatosis p/w inferior MI s/p cath w/multiple stents to
RCA and stent to PDA which restenosed requiring repeat cath and
stenting the morning of admission. Intra-aortic balloon and temp
pacing wire was placed. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
possible CABG. Now IABP and temp wire dc'd. Called out to floor.

.
##CARDIAC
# Ischemia: s/p MI tropT 14.24, RCA and PDA occlusions s/p
stents. Patient started on ASA, plavix, integrillin (completed
18hrs now dc'd), dc'd IV heparin. Ideally, would like to start
pt on both ACEi and BB however pt BP low and HR 50-60's. Since
patient already "beta blocked" (decreased BP and HR) started
ACEi for the benefits it has on remodeling and decreasing
afterload. Heparin gtt was discontinued and lovenox SQ [**Hospital1 **] was
started until therapeutic on coumadin. Patient was on coumadin
5mg qhs. Continued lisinopril 5mg PO QD and recommend starting
beta blocker as HR and BP allows. Cont lipitor 80mg QD.
# Pump: weaned off balloon pump, BP in 90-100's systolic with HR
50-60's. Asymptomatic, denies lightheadeness when getting out of
bed. ECHO [**11-21**] septal/inferior hypokinesis and EF 45%.
Continued lisinopril and autodiuresed goal of keeping even.
# Rhythm: NSR. Per records, pt had transvenous temp pacing wire
placed on [**11-18**] at OSH and went into afib. Temp wire was
discontinued with 6 beats of VT [**11-21**] no abnormal tele events
since. Again, consider starting beta blocker as tolerated.
.
## Anticoagulation: will need coumadin for long term (at least 6
months) given restenosis in the setting of factor V leiden
deficiency. Discontinued heparin gtt and started lovenox SQ [**Hospital1 **].
Continued coumadin 5mg qhs.
.
## Decreased Hct: 31.5 from 33.7. Likely dilutional as all cell
lines down. This am 33.1 from 31.5. Stable at time of discharge.
.
## Wheezing: continue duonebs, encourage quitting smoking.
.
## Urge incontinence: likely secondary to edema from foley
catheter. UA negative for UTI. Resolving at time of discharge.
.
## Chronic LBP: cont percocets PRN.
.
## FEN: encourage PO, cardiac healthy diet, consulting nutrition

.
## Prophy - on IV heparin bridge to coumadin, colace/senna and
dulcolax PRN as needed.
## Access - 2 PIVs
## Code - full code
## Dispo - PT consult, callout to [**Hospital Ward Name **] 6 today, likely d/c home
tomorrow if clinically stable, cardiac rehab in 4 weeks.

Discharge Instructions:
Please take medications as prescribed.

You have been started on a medication called warfarin that helps
prevents clot formation. You need to get your PT/INR lab checked
regularly and have your primary care physician follow the values
up and adjust your warfarin dose accordingly. You will likely
need to stay on coumadin for at least 6 months given your
history of factor V l
