Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
69 yo M h/o HIV, COPD presenting with shortness of breath and
"not feeling well." He was notably just admitted to [**Hospital1 2177**] for a
COPD exacerbation [**Date range (1) 2178**]. During this admission he was noted to
have a tenuous respiratory status with poor air movement and was
briefly intubated for a few hours. He was started on steroids
with a slow taper and azithromycin. Since his discharge he did
not feel well and came to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: 97.9 103 170/105 27 99% 3L. He was
noted to have poor air movement and given 125 mg IV solumedrol
and duonebs. BiPAP started, however patient vomited, so this was
stopped. He was given IV zofran and phenergan. ABG was
7.37/58/96, so once his nausea resolved, he was placed back on
BiPap. He was notably tachycardic to the 180s which was felt to
be afib vs. MAT. He was given 15 mg IV diltiazem and broke soon
after this. He was notably also given morphine and ativan. CXR
notable for hyperinflation. Vitalls prior to transfer:: 101
189/109 21 100% Bipap.
.
Upon arrival to the MICU, the patient was taken off of BiPAP due
to significant nausea. He was given IV compazine and placed on
nasal cannula with saturations near 100%. He continues to feel
short of breath.

Chest X-Ray:
1. Hyperexpanded lungs consistent with known diagnosis of COPD.
2. Stable right calcified lymph node.
3. No focal consolidation or pleural effusion.

ECHO:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). The right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with normal free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated and hypertrophied right ventricle
with preserved systolic function. Small and hyperdynamic left
ventricle. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2148-9-24**], RV is now mildly dilated and appears
hypertrophied. The other findings are probably similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo M h/o HIV on HAART, COPD on home oxygen, and remote
history of left leg DVT p/w worsening dyspnea after recent
discharge from OSH for COPD.
.
# Dyspnea: Likely COPD exacerbation. Patient has history of
severe emphysema and bronchiectasis. FEV1: 20% in spirometry
[**2150**] c/w end stage disease.  Patient was intermittently treated
with BIPAP in ICU, however his oxygen saturation was good and he
often requested BIPAP for only short amounts of time prior to
removing BIPAP. Mr. [**Known lastname 2150**] was started on Methylprednisolone 125
mg IV Q6H for the first day of admission and then was
transitioned to prednisone 60 mg daily.  He will continue on a
slow prednisone taper.  He was also treated with a 5 day course
of levofloxacin 750 mg.  Patient was treated with duonebs and
received ativan and oxycodone for dyspnea.  He was started on
bactrim, famotidine, and calc/vit D for prophylaxis for presumed
long term steroids.
.
# Multifocal atrial tachycardia: Patient was noted to have
multifocal atrial tachycardia ED, resolved prior to admission to
ICU. Likley secondary to underlying COPD.  Patient's COPD was
controlled and he did not have multifocal atrial tachycardia
while in ICU.  Diltiazem was started at 30mg TID for HR control
with HRs < 100.
.
# HTN: Patient with elevated SBPs.  He was started on PO
diltiazem as above and continued on doxazosin.
.
# H/O DVT: Patient was diagnosed with DVT in [**2152-3-17**].
Reportedly completed coumadin course per Dr.[**Name (NI) 2179**] note in
the past, however was continued due to sedentary life. On
admission, patient had sub-therpeutic INR.  Patient was started
on SQH and pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis.  He was continued on
coumadin at home dose.  He requires daily INR levels as we are
initiating bactrim therapy, coumadin should be adjusted as seen
fit to maintain INR between [**12-20**].
.
# HIV: Last CD4 count 247. Continued home HAART regimen.
.
# Hypernatremia: On presentation to ED.  Improved with IVF.
.
