History of Present Illness:
This 89 year old white male who had a week of productive sputum,
weakness and malaise and presented to the [**Hospital3 10494**] ED and was found to have elevated troponins and ST
depressions on the lateral leads of his EKG.  He
had CHF on CXR and was admitted to the telemetry floor and was
given 300 mg of Plavix and was also given IV Lasix and
Lopressor. He underwent cardiac catheterization today which
revealed 99%LM and 99%RCA lesions and he was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further management.

Pertinent Results:
[**2107-12-22**] - Chest CT
1. Diffuse vascular calcifications of the thoracic aorta, most
marked in the arch and descending region, but also involving the
ascending aorta. These images are available for review for
preoperative planning.
2. Small left and trace right pleural effusions.
3. Multifocal bronchial wall thickening, small airways disease
and patchy
dependent consolidation, likely due to multifocal infection.
Distribution and appearance favors aspiration pneumonia, but a
mycoplasma or other atypical infection is also within the
differential diagnosis. If infectious symptoms are absent,
followup CT may be considered in two to three months to exclude
a more chronic cause for these findings.
4. Emphysema with both centrilobular and panlobular features.
The panlobular basilar component suggest the possibility of
alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.
5. Diffuse coronary artery calcifications.

[**2107-12-26**] ECHO
The left atrium is elongated. No mass/thrombus is seen in the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 50 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] with borderline normal free wall function. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is partial mitral leaflet flail of
the anterior leaflet and posterior leaflet restriction. An
eccentric, inferiorly directed jet of Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric nature of the
regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). There is no pericardial
effusion.

Post-CABG:
All findings similar to pre-CABG findings. Biventricular
systolic function is preserved. All findings communicated to the
surgeon.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 75612**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2107-12-22**] via transfer
from [**Hospital6 3872**] for surgical management of his
severe coronary artery disease. His plavix was stopped and
heparin was started.  He was worked-up in the usual preoperative
manner. As his cardiac catheterization showed a severely
calcified aorta, a CT scan was performed. This confirmed a very
heavily calcified aorta including the ascending aorta. Given the
severity of his calcified aorta, it was elected to perform the
surgery off-pump. On [**2107-12-26**], Mr. [**Known lastname 75612**] was taken to the
operating room where he underwent off-pump coronary artery
bypass grafting to three vessels. Please see operative note for
details. Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit
for monitoring. Over the next several hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. Beta blockade, aspiriin
and a statin were resumed. His chest tubes and temporary pacing
wires were removed per protocol. He was evaluated and treated by
physical therapy and rehab was recommended. He was discharged to
rehab on POD# 6.
