Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain, SOB, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
74 yo M with COPD on 4L O2 at home intermittently, with baseline
Sat 91-92% on RA, HTN, ?DM who presents with acute onset of SSCP
around 3pm.  The patient reports he was grocery shopping with
his wife, when he began to feel that his breathing was becoming
labored.  He then continued on to another store, where he was
waiting for he wife; he suddenly began to feel intense SSCP.
This was associated with worsening SOB but no N/V, palpiations,
dizziness or diaphoresis.  Pain was described as pressure over
the sternum, 10/10 intensity, with no radiation. He called 911
was was brought to [**Hospital1 18**] - en route he received ASA 325, SL
nitro and supplemental O2, with some improvement in pain.

On arrival to the ED, initial vs were: T 99 P 100 BP 124/72 R 22
O2 sat. 81 % on RA --> 88-92% on NRB. He was given SL nitro 0.4
mg x1, Morphine IV x 3, dilaudid 1mg IV x1, prednisone 60 mg PO,
azithromycin 500 mg PO, albuterol and ipratropium nebs.  No
blood cultures were drawn.  Labs were significant for WBC of
17.6 (85% PMNs, 10% lymphs), normal electrolytes and 2 sets of
negative cardiac enzymes.  ECG showed no ischemic changes. CTA
showed no PE or dissection, low lung volumes with atelectasis.
Given his degree of hypoxia on NRB, the patient was admitted to
the MICU for further management.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient appeared comfortable.
Stated that his CP was significantly improved, to [**2-23**].

Images:
[**2183-11-1**]
- ECG 1: Sinus tachycardia. Ventricular ectopy. There is a late
transition which is probably normal. Non-specific ST-T wave
changes. Compared to the previous tracing ST-T wave changes are
slightly more pronounced.  TRACING #1

- ECG 2: These are unlabeled but presumabley right ventricular
leads. Sinus rhythm.  Non-specific ST-T wave changes. No
evidence of right ventricular myocardial infarction. Compared to
the previous tracing left ventricular ectopy is no longer
present.  TRACING #2

- CXR (portable):  AP upright portable chest radiograph is
obtained. Low lung volumes limit the evaluation. Cardiomegaly is
stable with unfolded thoracic aorta containing atherosclerotic
calcifications. The imaged lungs appear clear, without focal
consolidation, effusion, or CHF. The left CP angle and right CP
angle are partially excluded, thus limiting evaluation. The bony
structures appear grossly intact.
IMPRESSION: No acute findings.

- CTA Chest: There is no aortic dissection. There is no
pulmonary embolism.  There is severe atherosclerotic disease of
the thoracic aorta without aneurysm. There is severe coronary
artery vascular calcification, stable.  There is mild
enlargement of the main pulmonary artery to 3.7 cm, little
changed. There are extensive hypoventilatory changes with
bibasilar atelectasis. There is emphysema, unchanged. There is a
4 mm nodule in the right middle lobe (3:55), stable since [**2178**].
No new pulmonary nodules are present. There are calcified left
hilar nodes. There is stable appearing conglomeration of right
hilar lymph nodes measuring 2.6 cm. There are scattered
mediastinal and prevascular lymph nodes, stable. The appearance
of the thyroid is normal.  Limited views of the upper abdomen
appear normal. BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious-appearing
sclerotic or lytic lesions. There are extensive degenerative
changes of the thoracic spine with large anterior endplate
osteophytes in the mid thoracic spine, unchanged.
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic injury.
2. Extensive atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta and
coronary vessels.
3. Em
