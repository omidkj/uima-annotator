history of syncopal episodes now status post a fall after a
syncopal episode.  He was noted to be conversant at an
outside hospital.  On transfer, he had markedly decreased

showed a left subarachnoid bleed with intraparenchymal
hemorrhage.

3.  Diabetes.
4.  COPD.
5.  Questionable diagnosis of cancer of the prostate.

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to codeine and
erythromycin.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:  Inhalers.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The [**Location (un) 2611**] Coma Scale
was 3T.  Vital signs:  The blood pressure was 154/87, heart
rate 100, respiratory rate 28.  Chest:  Clear.  Abdomen:
Soft and nontender.  Extremities:  Without obvious trauma.

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 26, white blood cells
10,000.  Creatinine 1.5.

C-spine films were negative to C7.  The chest x-ray was
negative.  The head CT showed the above mentioned findings
with some cerebral edema.

The EKG showed no ischemic changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with the diagnosis
of head injury with subarachnoid bleed.  The patient was
admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with Neurosurgical
consultation.  He was observed closely and he was supported
with blood pressure management to avoid hypertension and
hypotension.

The patient was given nitroprusside p.r.n. for hypertension
and fluids for short periods of hypotension.  The patient was
transfused for blood loss anemia.  He seemed to have some
improvement in his mental status.  Diabetes was controlled
with insulin.

The patient, on follow-up CT scans, was noted to have a
nondisplaced pedicle fracture of C2 and he was placed in a
hard collar for six weeks at the recommendation of the
Orthopedic Service.

The patient was then discharged to the floor where he opened
eyes to stimulation.  He moved his extremities but did not
follow commands.  He was given some physical therapy.  The
patient then spiked a fever and developed some respiratory
difficulties.  He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit
and antibiotics were begun.  The patient was intubated and
appropriately monitored.  A CT of the head was performed
which showed no change.

The patient then improved to some degree from a respiratory
perspective.  However, mental status did not improve a great
deal.  At this time, he opened his eyes only with minimal
reflexes and did not follow any commands whatsoever.

There was a discussion with the family and due to his poor
prognosis, it was decided to make him comfort measures only.
Support was withdrawn and the patient expired.

2.  Respiratory failure.
3.  Pneumonia.
4.  Diabetes.
5.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
