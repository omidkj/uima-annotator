Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11040**]
Chief Complaint:
Sepsis, UTI, respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
7 yo F h/o bipolar, DM, found to be hypoxic this morning at her
[**Hospital3 **] facility. She was noted to be tachypneic to the
30s and satting 77% on RA. She was placed on 4L NC and came up
to 92%. EMS was called and on arrival she was put on a NRB for
transport and her sat came up to 98%.
On arrival to ED, VS were T 97, HR 86, BP 132/88, RR 20, SpO2
100% 15L. Chest x-ray was poor quality and difficult to
interpret, but diaphragmatic borders poorly defined bilaterally,
? RML opacities. Labs significant for hyperkalemia on 7.5, ARF
with Creatinine of 1.7 and BUN of 52, Hyponatremia of 119 and
hypochloremia of 86. Also significant for leukocytosis of 14
with 79% neutrophils. U/A was grossly positive for UTI. EKG was
NSR, with lad and no peaked T waves.
.
She was given Calcium gluconate, D50 and insulin for her
hyperkalemia and it came down to 6. She was given cefepime and
levofloxacin for urosepsis. She was given 2L IV NS. She was
noted to be tiring, so was started on BiPAP, but continued to
deteriorate. For her respiratory status, she was given
solumedrol 125mg IV, and albuterol nebs. She became
progressively tachypneic and she was intubated and put on
mechanical ventilation, and placed on propofol for sedation. She
became briefly hypotensive to the SBP in the 90s, and propofol
was stopped and he was switched to fentanyl/versed and her
pressure improved initially, but then decreased to 75/54. A RIJ
CVL ws placed, and patient was started on levophed 0.05
mg/kg/min. Got a total of 6-7L NS in ED.

Blood, Urine Cultures Negative

CT Chest:
1. Moderate pericardial effusion with moderate bilateral pleural
effusions
and extensive compressive atelectasis in both lower lobes
(infection not
excluded).

2. Mitral annular calcifications.

3. A 3 mm nodule needs no followup, the patient has low risk for
malignancy.
If the patient has risk factors for malignancy, then a followup
CT is
recommended in 12 months.

4. Heterogeneous enlarged thyroid gland should be further
evaluated with
thyroid ultrasound. A 13 x 22 mm heterogeneous nodule along the
inferior pole
of the right thyroid lobe could be a thyroid nodule; however, a
parathyroid
adenoma cannot be excluded. A thyroid ultrasound can answer this
question as
well.

TTE:

The left atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>50%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. with normal free wall contractility. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined. There is a small to moderate sized pericardial
effusion seen posteriorly. The effusion may be loculated. There
are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

CT Head:
1. No acute intracranial process.

2. Air-fluid level and mucosal thickening in the left maxillary
sinus as well
as opacification of right mastoid air cells could be consistent
with an
ongoing inflammatory process.

CT Abdomen:
1. Within limitations of a non-contrast-enhanced CT, no
intraperitoneal free
air or other acute findings to explain the patient's symptoms.

2. Large pericardial effusion similar to [**2174-4-1**].

3. Bilateral pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis.

4. 4-mm right lower lobe sub pleural nodule. Assuming no risk
factors for
malignancy, no further followup is necessary. If the patient is
at high risk
for malignancy, CT followup in 12 months should be considered.

5. Nodular contour of the liver could reflect liver disease,
including
cirrhosis. Small-to-moderate ascites.

6. Probable hyperdense cysts in the bilateral kidneys. Recommend
comparison
to outside studies if available and if not, follow up is
recommended as below.

7. Probable left adrenal adenoma. Six-month follow up
recommended if there is
no prior outside study available for comparison. This could be
done with an
adrenal mass protocol CT that also evaluates the hyperdense
renal lesions.

EEG:
Impression: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of a
discontinuous, attenuated [**2-6**] Hz delta rhythm background without
reactivity or state change. This pattern is consistent with a
severe
diffuse encephalopathy, commonly seen with medication effect,
metabolic
disturbance or infection. There were no focal abnormalities or
epileptiform features observed.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo female with h/o COPD, bipolar, presented with hypoxia,
ARF, hyperkalemia and suspected UTI.

1. Respiratory Failure: Treated initially for COPD flare with
steroids, albuterol and ipratropium nebs, and for health care
associated pneumonia with vancomycin and cefepime.  She had
significant pleural effusions on exam and CVP on admission was
33, making CHF a consideration.  Echocardiogram showed normal
ejection fraction and mild pericardial effusion.

2. Shock: On admission patient was persistently hypotensive
requiring levophed. It was thought that her shock was secondary
to sepsis from UTI, but her urine culture did not grow any
organisms, and she did not improve on broad spectrum
antibiotics. As above, she initially had an elevated CVP
suggesting cardiogenic shock, but her echo demonstrated normal
EF and no focal wall motion abnormalities. No echocardiographic
evidence of tamponade.  CT abdomen, CT chest did not show any
cause of her shock. She progressively required additi
