and alert with a neck brace in place.  Cranial nerves II
through XII were grossly intact.  No diplopia.  Biceps on the
left were 4 and triceps were 2, grasp was 0.  He was flaccid
in the right upper extremity with no strength and no tone.
He voluntarily moves the lower extremity to stimulation.  His

43, 1.6 and 107.  His creatinine kinase was 2154.  His
troponin was negative, MB was negative.  PT was 28.1, PTT
51.4, INR 5.2.  The patient was admitted to the Neurosurgical
Service and underwent emergent decompressive cervical
laminectomy for a epidural hematoma in the cervical spine.

canal.  This is likely representative of epidural hematoma,
or possibly subdural hematoma.
