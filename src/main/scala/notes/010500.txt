Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1136**]
Chief Complaint:
Fevers

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2142-12-26**]: Dental extraction x 12


History of Present Illness:
50-year-old male with history of atrial fibrillation, CAD, HTN,
CHF, morbid obesity, recent pontine and cerebellar infarcts
requiring prolonged surgical ICU hospitalization from
[**Date range (1) 83576**] complicated by persistent fevers and leukocytosis,
discharged [**12-13**] after trach and peg placement and on a course
of linezolid for VRE isolated from peripheral line on [**12-9**].
The patient was discharged to [**Hospital3 **], but presented to
[**Hospital1 2025**] ED with a T of 105. BP 132/78. CXR was concerning for left
sided pneumonia. He was empirically treated with 1 dose of
tamiflu. Influenza swab reportedly negative from records, though
unclear if this was done at rehab or at OSH. He already received
his dose of linezolid and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. He has
been incontinent of stool over the past day.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS: T 103 BP 130/78 HR 84 RR 16 100% on RA.
Neurology was consulted given his recent admission for multiple
cerebral infarcts. They would favor complete infectious work up
for his fevers, but have deferred LP for now, given his recent
posterior fossa infarcts.

He got a CT torso which was unrevealing. Head CT negative. He
was pancultured, and given a dose of Meropenem, and Flagyl
empirically for C diff. Vitals prior to transfer were: HR 104 T
95 BP 132/100 RR 18 O2 99%.

Currently, the patient is non communicative, which is apparently
his baseline.

Radiology
CXR ([**2142-12-16**]) - Tracheostomy tube tip is at the thoracic inlet.
Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. There is
mediastinal shifting towards the left side and increased opacity
in the left lower lobe in the retrocardiac area suggesting
worsening atelectasis in the left lower lobe with almost
complete collapse. The right lung is grossly clear. There is no
pneumothorax or enlarging pleural effusion. Right subclavian
catheter tip is in the upper SVC. There is no pneumothorax.

CT Head ([**2142-12-15**]) - IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage and
pontine, cerebellar, and left frontal hypodensity consistent
with old infarctions.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**2142-12-15**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of colitis or other etiology to explain diarrhea.

2. Inadequately characterized small right adrenal nodule,
unchanged from the comparison study and likely an adenoma.
3. Dense left lower lobe consolidation, corresponding to the
recent chest
radiograph and progressed from the comparison study.
4. Atherosclerotic disease.

CT Chest ([**2142-12-15**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. Airspace opacities noted at the bases bilaterally and
dependently within the left upper lobe. Although these findings
most likely represent atelectasis, aspiration or pneumonia
cannot entirely be excluded. Clinical correlation is
recommended.
2. Several prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, unchanged from
prior study and may be reactive in nature.
2. Stable partially visualized 1.2 mm indeterminate right
adrenal nodule. If not already performed, an MRI or dedicated
adrenal CT may be obtained for further evaluation.

TTE ([**2142-12-17**]) - IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to
patient's body habitus. Left ventricular function is mildly
hypokinetic. The right ventricle is not well seen. No pathologic
valvular abnormality seen. No vegetation or abscess seen (cannot
exclude). Pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
determined.

TEE ([**2142-12-24**]) - IMPRESSION: No
