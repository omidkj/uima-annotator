Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
Intraparenchymal hemorrhage in patient with recurrent falls
secondary to primary progressive MS


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture
G-tube
Intubation/extubation


History of Present Illness:
59 yo man with MS initially admitted with left basal ganglia
hemorrhage, then developed hemorrhage on the right side with
persistent encephalopathy, now with elevated wbc count and
bilateral obturator muscle abscess who is being transferred to
the medicine service from the MICU for overnight monitoring for
hypotension/tachycardia and concern for sepsis.
.
Hospital course:
Initially admitted on [**2117-4-15**] with recurrent falls and found to
have bilateral basal ganglia hemorrhages.  Prior to the
admission he had been feeling unwell for 3-4 days with increase
in baseline cough, increased urinary frequency, and dysuria,
worsening lower extremity weakness, and falls while attempting
transfer from wheelchair to bed.
.
He has had persistent encephalopathy (of multifactorial
etiology, pna/uti/nite-day cycle reversal. He was tx for a LLL
infiltrate (MRSA PNA) and finished a 10 day course of linezolid
(vanco allergy), levofloxacin and metronidazole for presumed
aspiration pneumonia). On [**5-17**] he was transferred to the MICU for
hypotension and an elevated wbc count (21). The fever workup was
most notable for an abdominal CT which revealed a fluid
collection in the bilateral obturator muscles, for which he
underwent an IR guided biopsy on [**5-26**].  He was initially treated
for this with levo/flagyl.  This was switched to linezolid and
zosyn  but he developed a rash and eosinophilia and was switched
back to levo/flagyl on [**5-21**].
.
He was continuing to remain stable with an unclear etiology for
the obturator abscesses, when on [**6-2**] he became hypotensive to
the 80's systolic and sinus tachycardia to the 130's-140's. His
labs that day were also notable for an increase in the WBC from
10 to 23. He was given 2 L NS on the floor, with an improvement
of his BP to 98 systolic and persistent tachycardia to 120's. He
was then transferred to the MICU for monitoring. In the MICU,
his abx were broadened to po Vanc (to cover for cdiff),
Aztreonam, Linezolid (given h/o MRSA PNA), and levo/flagyl. He
received 5.5 L total of NS in the MICU with his BP now stable in
the 110's systolic. He continues to have asymptomatic sinus
tachycardia into the 110's-120's.
.
Currently patient is unable to answer any questions as he is
lethargic, though arousable.

CHEST, UPRIGHT AP VIEW: Comparison is made to [**2113-10-24**]. The
heart size is normal. The aortic contour is unchanged. The lungs
are clear. There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. There
is prominence of the soft tissues of the lower neck.

IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
process.

NON-CONTRAST CT HEAD: There is a small oval hyperdensity seen
within the left putamen with surrounding lucency likely
indicating intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema.
There is no shift of normally midline structures. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white
matter differentiation is preserved. There is no evidence of
blood within the ventricles or elsewhere within the parenchyma.

The paranasal sinuses are well aerated. No fractures are seen.

IMPRESSION: Small ovoid hyperdensity in the left putamen with
surrounding lucency, likely representing intraparenchymal
hemorrhage with surrounding edema. No mass effect or other areas
of hemorrhage. No hydrocephalus.

Recent outside films with similar findings were reviewed with
neurology team.

[**6-9**] - CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Again demonstrated are
bilateral fluid collections tracking beneath the fascia of the
obturator internus muscles bilaterally. Allowing for slight
differences in contrast phase from the prior CT, these appear
unchanged in size and in overall appearance. The medial width of
the right collection is 1 cm, and the posterior width of the
collections are approximately 1 cm respectively. There is no gas
within the collections and no destruction of the adjacent
osseous structures to suggest osteomyelitis. Mildly prominent
prostate again not
