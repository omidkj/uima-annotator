HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 805**] is an 89 year-old
woman who is admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
further management of unresponsiveness and hypotension.  She
is a resident of [**Hospital3 537**] with multiple medical problems
including severe sacral decubitus ulcer, paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation and dementia who has been progressively
declining over the last several weeks.  She has been recently
started on broad spectrum antibiotics and has become
progressively less responsive.  On the afternoon of admission
she was found unresponsive to painful stimuli.  Her
temperature at that time was 96.9, heart rate 109, her blood
pressure was 90/50 and her respiratory rate was 32 and her
oxygen saturation was 80% on 4 liters.  The patient was
brought to the [**Hospital3 **] Emergency Room by ambulance.

In the Emergency Room the patient was intubated secondary to
hypertension and unresponsiveness.  Her blood pressure
initially was 80/50, and subsequently dropped to 60 systolic.
A right femoral line was inserted.  The patient's
electrocardiogram revealed rapid atrial fibrillation.  The
patient was started on Dopamine.  Her heart rate increased to
140 and Dopamine was subsequently discontinued and the
patient was continued with aggressive hydration.  After
receiving 2 liters of normal saline the patient's systolic
blood pressure increased to 100 systolic, but subsequently
dropped to 60 and the Dopamine was restarted.  The patient
underwent a head CT, which revealed no change.  A chest x-ray
revealed a likely right middle lobe pneumonia.  The patient
received one dose of Levofloxacin.  She was transferred to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further care.

There, Dopamine was discontinued and she underwent a
synchronized cardioversion with 100, 200 and 360 jewels
without success.  Her blood pressure remained in the 90 to
100 range systolic.

fibrillation.  3.  Congestive heart failure.  4.  Coronary
artery disease.  5.  Left above the knee amputation.  6.

nodule.  10.  Sacral decubitus ulcer.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  1.  Levaquin 500 mg q day.  2.  Piperacillin 4
grams q 8 hours.  3.  Gentamycin 70 mg q 8 hours.  4.

mg q.i.d.  9.  Lactulose 30 mg b.i.d.  10.  Tamoxifen 10 mg

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at [**Hospital3 537**].  Her
primary care physician [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at [**Hospital6 **].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, the patient is a frail
elderly African American woman who is intubated and sedated
and minimally responsive to verbal or painful stimuli.  Her
temperature was 98.8 rectally.  Her blood pressure was 90/60
on 10 mcg of Dopamine.  Her heart rate was 130 to 140 and her
assist control ventilation was 500 cc by 14 breaths per
minute with an FIO2 of 100%.  Her head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat was remarkable for anicteric sclera and constricted
pupils and dry mucous membranes.  She had no jugulovenous
distention.  She had diffuse rhonchi.  Her heart was tachy
and irregular.  Her abdomen was mildly distended and
nontender.  Her extremities revealed a left above the knee
amputation and her right lower extremity was warm with trace
edema and 1+ pedal pulses.  Her neurologic examination, she
was not responsive to verbal or painful stimuli.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 34.4, hematocrit
38.9.  Sodium 138, potassium 3.2, chloride 102, bicarb 22,
BUN 10, creatinine .6, glucose 143.  ALT 4, alkaline
phosphatase 105, amylase 127, lipase 10, total bilirubin 0.4,
CK 16, calcium 8.3, magnesium 1.8, phosphorous 3.5, INR 1.3,
PT 13.7, PTT 35.0.  Electrocardiogram showed atrial
fibrillation with normal axis rate of 150.  Chest x-ray
showed opacified right heart consistent with right middle
lobe pneumonia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit where she was treated for overwhelming
sepsis presumed to be due to a right middle lobe pneumonia
and contamination from a large sacral decubitus ulcer and
osteomyelitis, which had previously been deemed inoperable.
She ultimately succumbed to sepsis.

1.  Hypotension:  The patient required multiple pressors.
She was initially placed on neosinephrine, which was
eventually switched over the Levophed drip.  Ultimately the
patient's blood pressure decreased to systolic pressures in
the 60s despite maximal management with pressers and fluids.
The patient ultimately expired secondary to sepsis.

2.  Sacral ulcer:  The ulcer had previously been deemed
nonsurgically treatable.  It was treated with intravenous
antibiotics including Levofloxacin and Ceftazidime for
pseudomonal coverage.

3.  Respiratory:  The patient was mechanically ventilated on
assist control ventilation.

4.  Renal:  The patient's urine output decreased secondary to
renal hyperperfusion consistent with shock.

5.  Code status:  Attempts were made repeatedly to discuss
the patient's grave prognosis with the family.  On [**12-18**]
an attempt was made to contact the family who did not meet
with the Medical Intensive Care Unit attending.  It was felt
that CPR would not be indicated in this patient by the
attending physician and [**Name Initial (PRE) **] record of this was made in the
chart.  On the evening of the patient's demise, the family
was contact[**Name (NI) **] and agreed to make the patient's comfort a
priority and the patient was placed on a morphine drip.  She
expired at 5:45 a.m. after her heart was found to be in
asystole.
