Service: NEUROSURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2724**]
Chief Complaint:
Back pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. T9 transpedicular decompression of the spinal cord
2. T6-T11 pedicle screw instrumentation segmental (Expedium).


History of Present Illness:
77 y.o. man with a history of metastatic prostate cancer
admitted with back pain and found to have compression fractures
with canal narrowing, transferred from neurosurgy without
intervention for radiation. The patient states that he suffered
from severe back pain over the past several weeks. He describes
[**11-26**] pain, currently at 5/10. This is exacerbated with movement
and is tender to palpation. His pain is markedly improved now on
fentanyl patch and percocet PRN. He denies any clear lower
extremity weakness or changes in sensation in the lower
extremities or groin. The patient denies any incontinence of
bowel or bladder.

The patient was admitted through the ED and found to have mets
to T9-10 and L3 with associated canal narrowing and low-level
compression. The patient was initially admitted to neurosurgery.
He was started on dexamethasone 4mg Q6h. His course was
complicated by urinary retention. It was decided that surgical
intervention is not currently indicated and the patient was
transferred to OMED for radiation therapy.


Past Medical History:
ONC HX:
Pt was initially diagnosed with localized prostate cancer in
[**2099**] via a medial laparotomy. At that time, he had negative
lymph nodes. He was treated with external beam radiation until
04/[**2100**]. He did well until [**3-/2103**], when he was noted to have a
rise in his PSA. He was started on Eulexin and Zoladex. He had a
very good response, which lasted for 5-6 years. On [**2108-11-13**],
he was started on mitoxantrone and prednisone [**2-19**] rising PSA. He
was continued on this therapy for 5 cycles and then was started
on secondary hormonal therapy with ketoconazole and
hydrocortisone. [**10-20**] his PSA started rising, suggesting
progression of disease on hydrocortisone and ketoconazole. His
PSA has continued to rise this year going up to 98 [**2111-3-17**] and
bone scan at the time showed slightly increased uptake at T10,
but no evidence of mets. CT thorax showed stable lung nodules,
adrenal adenoma, fat stranding of left psoas muscles possibly
c/w metastatic disease and mildly enlarging infrarenal AAA. He
was then admitted in [**4-/2111**] for back pain and was found to have
an L3 lesion concerning for metastases and he was started on
XRT. In the interim, he was also continued on Zoladex. In
[**7-/2111**], he was restaged following the completion of his XRT.
Between [**7-22**] and the present he has been continued off of all
therapies except for Lupron and had been doing well including
weaning himself off of all pain medications. However, his PSA
again began to elevate, most recently 172 in 9/[**2111**].

ventral canal compressing the cord at T9. Additionally at L3,
there is retropulsion with ventral canal narrowing and
impression on the thecal sac.  Paraspinal mass as noted above.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Hospital **] hospital course:
A/P: 77 y.o. man with a history of metastatic prostate cancer
admitted with back pain and found to have compression fractures
with canal narrowing, transferred from neurosurgy without
intervention for radiation.

# Spinal mets with question of early compression. Stable without
signs of progressive neurologic symptoms. Neurosurgery
recommends XRT prior to consideration of surgery.
- Radiation oncology consult for likely radiation therapy to
spine
- Possible future neurosurgical intervention
- Decadron 4mg Q6h
- Close neurologic monitoring

# Pain. Most likely related to tumor burden in spine. Improved
control control.
- Continue fentanyl patch 50 mcg/hr Q72H
- Cont percocet prn
- PT consult

# Prostate ca. Metastatic s/p chemotherapy and radiation. Most
recently on Lupron. Last staged in [**9-/2111**] did not show clear
progression by imaging but recent increase PSA concerning for
progression.  Now newly metastatic to thoracic spine.
- To discuss further therapy with primary oncologist.

# CAD. S/p MI x2 in [**2081**] and [**2098**]. Stable without signs of acute
disease.
- Continue atenolol 12.5 mg QD, valsartan 80mg QHS, isosorbide
mononitrate 90mg QD
- To consider starting aspirin. Unclear why he is not on this
currently. Did he have a hemorrhagic CVA in the past?
- NTG SL prn

# CHF. EF reportedly 30% sometime in [**2109**] per Oncology notes but
no study in OMR.
- Cardiac regimen as above.
- Continue Digoxin 0.125 mg QD
- Continue Furosemide 40 mg QD

# History of A. Fib. Patient is rate controlled. Not on
anticoagulation currently. By the patient's report,
anticoagulation was held due to prostatic mets. It is unclear if
this is a true contraindication. We must clarify if the patient
had a hemorrhagic or ischemic CVA in the past.
- Continue rate control with atenolol.
- To consider anticoagulation pending review of past CVA.

# Urinary retention. Likely secondary to prostate CA. No other
signs of associated cord compression to imply a neurologic
process. Patient was on Flomax prior to admission.
- Continue foley to gravity
- Continue tamsulosin

# Past CVA. Hist
