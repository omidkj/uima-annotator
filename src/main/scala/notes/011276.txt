Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14782**] is a 35M with h/o DM type I (h/o retinopathy, DKA,
gastroparesis), ESRD on HD (MWF), HTN admitted to ICU with
nausea, vomiting (10 episodes per day for 2 days, reportedly
with some small amounts of blood), abdominal pain, and inability
to take PO (water but no food), now transferred to floor after
AG closed.

ACTIVE DIAGNOSES:
#Type I DM: Upon presentation to ICU, patient had FSG >300 and
AG 16. Serum ketones were not assessed, so it is uncertain if he
had AG from ketoacidosis or from renal failure.  He had poor PO
intake the morning of presentation secondary to gastroparesis,
and missed his AM Lantus, which is the likely etiology of his
ketoacidosis, if present. He has no infectious signs or
symptoms.  He was started on an insulin gtt and his AG closed in
the ICU. Patient was restart on home insulin regimen and
transferred to the floor.  He was maintained on a diabetic,
consistent carbohydate diet.  [**Last Name (un) **] consult recommended carb
counting and 1:15 humalog sliding scale, as well as 5U Lantus in
the morning and 4U Lantus in the PM.  He will follow-up with
[**Last Name (un) **] as an outpatient.

#Hypertension: Patient was hypertensive in the ED to SBP to
200s.  Patient's blood pressure normally runs 160s/80s,
secondary to DMI and ESRD.  Current elevation in bp likely
secondary to distress from nausea and vomiting and improved
somewhat with anti-emetic and analgesic therapy.  Patient's dose
of lisinopril was increased from 20 to 40 daily and started on
clonidine patch 0.1mg weekly.  In the two days it takes the
clonidine patch to work, he was bridge 0.1mg PO qhs.  He was
also provided HD per home schedule, which provided volume
control.  On discharge his bp was 140s/80s.

# Nausea/vomiting/gastroparesis: Patient has had multiple
admissions for nausea and vomiting secondary to gastroparesis,
most recently discharged on [**12-6**]. It is likely that this
presentation is due to a flare of his gastroparesis, leading to
nausea/vomiting and not taking his insulin. He has no signs or
symptoms of an infectious etiology. Metabolic alkalosis also
seen on ABG likely secondary to vomiting.  He was continued on
compazine and zofran for nausea, and he was started on
erythromycin and reglan for GI motility.  In discussions with
his internist, outpatient visits have been challenging in the
recent past, given the escalation of his condition and inpatient
needs.  He was referred for outpatient follow-up with GI
motility specialist, and the internist was aware to prepare a
referral for the patient, in conjunction with discussions with
the patient once the appointment was scheduled.

# Anemia.  Hct trended down from 29.8 on admission to 24 by the
time of transfer to the floor from the ICU.  Anemia is likely
secondary to hemodilution, as all cell lines trended down and
patient received IVF in ICU for DKA.  Patient is chronically
anemic secondary to ESRD and epo deficiency.  He had no active
source of bleeding.  In [**2186-7-24**], iron studies were normal.
Hct as monitored during hospitalization.

# ESRD on HD.  Patient normally gets HD on MWF and was
maintained on this regimen while in house.  He was also
continued on Sevelamer, NephroCaps, and Epo.  His medications
were renally dosed.

# Hematemesis: He had small volume hematemesis on admission,
which was likely caused by retching in the setting of
gastroparesis. His NG l
