Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
ventricular tachycardia arrest/dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2174-11-11**] - Aortic valve replacement with 19-mm St. [**Hospital 923**] Medical
Regent mechanical heart valve, aortic root enlargement with
bovine pericardium.
[**2174-11-9**] - Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 63 male with multiple medical problems
including critical aortic stenosis who is admitted to CCU
following ventricular tachycardia arrest during cardiac
catheterization. He was in his normal state of health until this
past fall when he developed progressive dyspnea with exertion.
He denies symptoms concerning for angina. On exam, he was noted
to have a murmur consistent with aortic stenosis. He underwent a
surface echocardiogram that revealed aortic valve area by
continuity equation of 0.7 cm2 (trileaflet). He was referred to
[**Hospital1 18**] cardiac surgery for evaluation for aortic valve
replacment.

On the day of admission, he underwent left heart catheterization
to evaluate coronary anatomy. He was in his normal state of
health before case. Arterial access obtained through right
radial without issue (3:10PM).  He then started to complain of
his right arm hurting him and became very anxious and said he
felt claustrophobic. His systolic blood pressure drifted down to
the 60s with heart rate in the fifties (3:16PM). He was given
atropine and started on dopamine.
He felt warm, diaphoretic, and restless. His blood pressure and
heart rate were variable, with narrow complex tachycardia up to
140s. The left circulation was injected (3:28).  He was noted to
have increasing PVCs on telemetry and then at 4:02PM developed
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with loss of pulse. CPR was
initiated and he was shocked x2 with return of pressure.  CPR
done for approximately 1 minute.  He was intubated w/ fent/midaz
and still agitated so paralyzed. Initial ABG 7.17/46/180/18.
Catheterization showed no significant CAD, mean wedge 16,
cardiac index of 3.92.  Right groin venous sheath placed. TTE
w/out effusion. Repeat ABG 7.22/40/290/17. He was given at least
1.4L IVF during the case. Given dose of Ancef.

On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Imaging/procedures:
-Cardiac cath ([**2174-11-9**]) - 1. Coronary angiography of this right
dominant system demonstrated one
vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was short and patent.
The LAD
had a proximal 40 % and 50% D1 stenosis. The LCX had a mid 30%
stenosis.
The RCA had a proximal 30% and distal 40% stenosis.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left
sided
filling pressures, with RVEDP 14 mmHg and PCW 16 mmHg. There was

moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension at rest, with PASP 46
mmHg. The
cardiac output was preserved at rest, with cardiac index 3.9
L/min/m2.
3. Event summary: Initial access obtained in right radial artery
using a
5 F sheath. After passing catheter centrally to ascending aorta,
patient
started feeling very estless, and felt hot and non-specifically
agitated. Denied chest pain or SOB, but initial central BP low
with SBP
88 mmHg, and then dropping down to 65 mmHg despite IV fluid
boluses.
Patient diaphoretic and HR 55/min. Given 0.5 mgIV atropine, with

increase HR but no improvement in BP. Then dopamine infusion was

started. Patient became intermittently agitated and tachycardic
with HR
increase to 150 bpm transiently and associated drops in BP to
SBP 70's.
When he would calm down, HR would decrease and SBP would improve
even
off dopamine. Initial angiography left coronary selective in the
LCX,
but no evient LMCA disease or dissection in thoracic aorta on
limited
contrast puffs. Decided to withdraw catheter from body, and
stabilize
patient clinically. He has no other feature to suggest allergic
response, but still very anxious. Called Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 45821**] of Ct
surgery to
discuss situation. Patient still too agitated to perform
coronary
angiography. While monitoring patient, he developed some mild
chest
tightness and PVC's and then had VF cardiac arrest. CPR
immediately
initiated and then quickly underwent successful DC cardioversion
with
restoration of pulse. With CPR and cardioversion, sheath
dislodged from
right radial artery, and TR band placed over the site. After [**12-5**]

minutes, he had another VF cardiac arrest with very brief CPR
and almost
inmmediate cardioversion. Anesthesia called stat, and patient
sedated
and intubated. Now more hemodynamically stable with better BP,
and
dopamine stopped. Access then obtained in right CFA and CFV and
coronary
angiography and RHC performed. At end of case, patient
hemodynamically
quite stable with BP 140/80 off pressors, good cardiac output,
and PCWP
16. Right CFA access site closed using AngioSeal device.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. one vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Hypotension and VF cardiac arrest likely secondary to
vasovagal
episode in the context of severe aortic stenosis. Echocardiog
