CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate pleural effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
65 year old man s/p AVR/MVR/TVrepair
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate pleural effusions
INDICATION: A 65-year-old man status post trivalve repair.
Evaluate pleural effusions.

COMPARISON: PA and lateral chest x-ray dated [**2144-1-15**].

PA AND LATERAL CHEST X-RAY: A small left pleural effusion is
stable. A tiny right pleural effusion is either new or slightly
increased since prior exam. The appearance of the lungs is
otherwise unchanged and unremarkable. The patient is status post
median sternotomy with trivalve repair. A left chest wall
single-lead pacemaker is positioned in the coronary sinus. The
surrounding soft tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Stable left, and slightly increased tiny right
pleural effusions.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Marked LA enlargement. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast in the body
of the LA. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.
Depressed LAA
emptying velocity (<0.2m/s) No thrombus in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Markedly dilated RA. Normal
interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Suboptimal
technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully
excluded. Mildly depressed LVEF. [Intrinsic LV systolic function
likely
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.]

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Mild global RV free
wall
hypokinesis.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Focal calcifications in
aortic root.
Moderately dilated ascending aorta. Focal calcifications in
ascending aorta.
Normal aortic arch diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic arch.
Mildly dilated
descending aorta. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mechanical aortic valve prosthesis (AVR). Cannot
exclude AS.
Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular
calcification. Moderate MS (MVA 1.0-1.5cm2) Moderate (2+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate [2+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE

Conclusions for
post-bypass data

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen
in the body of the left atrium.
2. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. The left
atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No
thrombus is seen
in the left atrial appendage.
3. The right atrium is markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D
or color Doppler.
4. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed. [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is
likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitatio
