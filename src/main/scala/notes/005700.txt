Pertinent Results:
[**2101-5-3**] Cardiac cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this
right dominant system demonstrated two vessel coronary artery
disease. The LMCA had no significant stenoses. The LAD had a
sub-total occlusion at the origin and a 70% stenosis mid-vessel
at D2. The LCX had no significant
stenoses. The RCA had a 60-70% stenosis mid-vessel. 2. Limited
resting hemodynamics revealed normotension.
.
[**2101-5-4**] Carotid U/S: Right ICA <40% stenosis. Left ICA <40
stenosis.
.
[**2101-5-4**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Doppler parameters are
indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal limits).
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal regional and global biventricular systolic
function. Mild aortic regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, MR. [**Name14 (STitle) 110879**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac cath. Cath revealed severe two vessel coronary artery
disease. He was referred for bypass surgery and underwent
pre-operative work-up. On [**2101-5-5**] he was brought to the
operating room where he underwent an off-pump coronary artery
bypass graft x 3. Please see operative note for surgical
details. Following surgery he was transferred to the CIVCU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later this day he was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
On post-op day one he was started on beta-blockers and diuretics
and gently diuresed towards his pre-op weight. Later this day he
was transferred to the step-down floor for further care. Chest
tubes and epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. His
coumadin was restarted for his CVA history.Since Mr.[**Name14 (STitle) 110880**] is on
Coumadin, per Dr.[**First Name (STitle) **], no need for Plavix s/p OPCAB. He had
urinary retention requiring foley replacement. He worked with
physical therapy for strength and mobility. He continued to make
steady progress and was discharged to Applevalley Skilled
Nursing in [**Location (un) **] on POD #4. All follow up appointments were
advised.
