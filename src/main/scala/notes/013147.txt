Allergies:
Cephalosporins / Theophylline / Prevacid

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea, vomiting, osteomy output

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 75yoF with a history of COPD on home 02 and chronic
prednisone, DM2, HTN who was recently hospitalized in
[**Month (only) 216**]-[**2117-9-23**] for ischemic colitis s/p total colectomy
with end ileostomy and chronic tracheostomy due to perioperative
respiratory failure.  She presents with increased watery ostomy
ouput, nausea/vomiting, and a UTI.
.
She was rehabbing at [**Hospital1 **], when according to her daughter, she
developed nausea and intermittent vomiting on [**2117-10-26**], and
subsequent decreased PO intake.  Her ostomy output increased to
about 600-800cc daily since [**2117-10-27**], assuming a watery
consistency. Urine output trailed off though creatinine remained
at baseline around 0.7. She was empirically placed on IV flagyl
on [**10-29**] though the initial C dif assay was negative. Otherwise,
patient has denied fevers, chills, abdominal pain, chest pain,
shortness of breath, dysuria or hematuria. No malaaise or
arthralgias.
.
Of note, she developed a resistant ESBL E coli UTI at rehab on
[**2117-10-27**], and has not received treatment thus far due to concern
regarding cephalosporin/carbopenem cross reactivity. Her foley
was last changed on [**2117-10-26**].  Also, she has progressive anemia
with HCT 23-24 in rehab requiring a unit PRBC on [**10-29**] with
imrpovement of HCT to 25.  She was guiac negative there and in
our ED.
.
She has received multiple antibiotic courses recently: Levaquin
for 8 days in [**Month (only) 205**] for pneumonia.  Vancoymcyin for cellulitis of
her surgical site in early [**Month (only) 462**].  Zosyn/meropenem for ESBL
ecoli pneumonia at that time as well.  And a 2 week course of
zosyn for aspiration pneumonia at [**Hospital1 **] recently completed.
.
With regard to her respiratory status, she was on 3LNC prior to
her surgery for ishemic colitis last month-  she failed several
attempts to liberate her from the ventilator and eventually
developed an ESBL ecoli pneumonia.  A tracheostomy was placed at
bedside on [**2117-9-22**], and eventually was weaned to nighttime
ventilatory support with trach capping during the daytime hours.

.
In the ED, initial vital signs were T97.9 HR94 BP152/44 RR20
97%4LNC. Received 2LNS.  Surgery consulted due to her recent
colectomy. UA suggestive of UTI.  ID curbsided re: safety of
carbopenem use with a cephalosporin allergy, and reassured that
cross reactivity is rare.  Got meropenem 500mg.  C dif sent as
well.  Prior to transfer, VS BP138/69, P99, RR30,96%3L.
.
On the floor, initial VS were T98.2 P102 BP135/55 RR14
Sat95/4LNC. She is tired and falling asleep.  Denying any pain
or discomfort.
.

KUB:
IMPRESSION: Paucity of bowel gas limits evaluation for luminal
distention. No free air is seen
.
CXR;
IMPRESSION: There has been no change in the appearance of the
chest with
findings at the left lung base which may be chronic
.
CXR ([**2117-11-1**]): FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study
of this date, the Dobbhoff tube has been advanced so that the
tip lies well in the stomach. Little change in the appearance of
the heart and lungs with persistent opacification at the left
base consistent with some combination of atelectasis and
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 25731**] is a 75yoF with a history
of recent ischemic colitis s/p colectomy and end-ileostomy,
COPD, chronic tracheostomy, GERD, HTN admitted for malaise,
Nausea and increased ostomy output and UTI.
.
# INCREASED OSTOMY OUTPUT: C.difficile positive on admission.
Multiple case reports of small bowel enteritis secondary to
C.diff in setting of total colectomy. GI consulted to ensure
proper mgmt in unique setting. After review patient treated with
monotherapy with PO vanc. Decision made to d/c flagyl due to
concern that flagyl was contributing to nausea, vomiting.
Furthermore, patient with signs/sx consistent with mild C.diff
therefore monotherapy acceptable.  Surgery, consulted in setting
of recent colectomy, had no recs and planned to have the patient
follow-up with outpatient provider as scheduled. Patient to
complete a 7 day course after completion for meropenem.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- Continue treatment of C.diff with PO vancomycin until
[**2117-11-16**]
.
# ESBL E COLI UTI: Diagnosed while in house however was
asymptomatic. Foley catheter was initially placed however was
subsequently removed.
OUTPATIENT ISSUES:
-- Started meropenem for 10 day course. Last day of meropenem
will be on [**2117-11-9**].
.
# MALNUTRITION: Patient had chronic nasogastric tube for
nutritional supplement. On admission, patients tube was in good
position and feeds were continued. Ther
