History of Present Illness:
This is a 78 year old female with chronic atrial fibrillation
and cerebrovascular disease who presents with worsening dyspnea.
She has known aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation and has
been followed closely with serial echocardiograms which have
shown worsening gradients. She has been referred for aortic
valve replacement and possible mitral rpelacement as well..
Recent cardiac catheterization revealed normal coronary
arteries.

Pertinent Results:
[**2107-10-14**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is moderately
dilated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of
the left atrium. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is
present in the left atrial appendage. The left atrial appendage
emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus is seen in
the left atrial appendage. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is some
hypertrophy of the septum in the LVOT which does not cause
obstruction. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There
is severe mitral annular calcification. The mitral valve
pathology is consistent with calcifications. There is mild
valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5-2.0cm2). Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is a very small pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
was notified in person of the results prior to incision.
POST-BYPASS: The patient is AV paced. The patient is on no
inotropes. Biventricular function is unchanged. There is a
well-seated, well-positioned bioprosthetic valve in the aortic
position. No aortic regurgitation is seen. There is a gradient
of 10 mmHg across the aortic valve at a BP of 110/52. Mitral
regurgitation is mild (1+). Tricuspid regurgitation is
unchanged. There is no LVOT obstruction. The aorta is intact
post-decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted on [**10-4**] for IV Heparin bridging while off
Coumadin. Her preoperative workup wqas completed and she was
underwent surgery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2107-10-14**]. She weaned from
bypass on Neo Synephrine and in atrial fibrillation. Almost
immediaetly upon arrival in the ICUU she had ventricular
styandstill and was paced via the temporrary wires in place.
This proved unreliable, (she never required CPR) and her atrial
fibrillation returned with a ventricular response in the 70s.
The Electrophysiology Service saw her and she was taken to the
lab where a ventricular pacemaker was implanted.

 She was extubated the following morning after awaking
neurologically intact to her baseline. The pacemaker was
interrogated, worked appropriately and the temporary wires were
removed. Chest tubes were later removed per protocol.  She was
gently diuresed towards her preoperative weight and Physical
Therapy was consulted.

She remained hemodynamically stable and progressed slowly.  On
POD 5 she was able to trnasfer to the step down floor.  She was
discharged to rehabilitation at [**Hospital1 **] on POD 7 for
further recovery.  Arrangement were made for follow up with all
approprite care givers.

Coumadin INR goal is 2-2.5 for atrial fibrillation.
