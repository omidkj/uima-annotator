History of Present Illness:
73 year old man who presented after 30 minutes of left-sided
chest pressure, [**11-17**], non-radiating, that started after walking
up stairs at church. He reports that he did not have any jaw or
arm pain, or diaphoresis, and that the pain resolved after 30
minutes with rest. He reports that he has had similar chest pain
but not as severe for several days, possibly 1 week. Initially
he would have the pain with ambulating, going up stairs, and
over the past two days he has had less severe chest pain wake
him from sleep. One the day prior to admission he also had 30
minutes of chest pain when climbing the stairs in his house. On
the day of admission, he had chest pain at church, and EMS was
called. He was given ASA by EMS, and the pain had resolved by
time of arrival to ED.

Findings
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2200-5-27**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. Normal
interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). No resting LVOT
gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen. Abnormal septal
motion/position.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mitral valve annuloplasty ring. Well-seated mitral
annular ring with normal gradient. No MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: No TS. Physiologic TR. Indeterminate PA
systolic pressure.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. A
mitral valve annuloplasty ring is present. The mitral annular
ring appears well seated with normal gradient. No mitral
regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2200-5-27**],
the LVEF remains normal.


Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted from the emergency room with chest pain after he was
noted to have an elevated BNP with evidence of acute diastolic
heart failure with acute kidney injury with cr 2.5, but ruled
out for myocardial infarction.  He was worked up for cardiac
disease which included cardiac catheterization. It revealed
significant disease and an echocardiogram revealed diastolic
dysf
