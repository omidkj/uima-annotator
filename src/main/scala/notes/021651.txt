Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is an 83 year old
man who lives in [**Male First Name (un) 1056**], who arrived in the United
States four days prior to admission to visit his daughter who
lives in the [**Name (NI) 86**] area.  On the day of admission, the
patient developed subscapular chest pain radiating to the
left arm but denied other symptoms.  The patient reports that
he had similar pain in the past for which he has not sought
medical attention.  He had unclear medical follow-up in
[**Male First Name (un) 1056**].

In the Emergency Room, the patient's EKG was concerning for
anterolateral myocardial infarction with ST elevations in V1
to V3 and ST depressions inferolaterally.  The patient was
given aspirin, Nitroglycerin as well as Lopressor in the
Emergency Room and sent to the Cardiac Catheterization
Laboratory.

At the Catheterization laboratory the patient was found to
have severe three vessel disease with moderately elevated
filling pressures.  The patient received cypher stents to the
left anterior descending coronary artery as well as the left
circumflex artery.  The patient was stable throughout the
procedure and was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit for
close monitoring due to the high risk of lesions that were
stented.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Asthma.
2.  Extensive tobacco history with presumably chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.
3.  The patient denies any history of diabetes mellitus,
hypertension or previous myocardial infarction.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   The patient denies any past surgical
history.

MEDICATIONS:  He denies taking any medications at home.

ALLERGIES:   The patient denies any allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient lives alone in [**Male First Name (un) 1056**] with
six children living in the United States.  The patient smoked
tobacco approximately [**2-14**] to one pack per day for most of his
life, but quit approximately 20 years ago.  The patient
denies alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   The patient's temperature was 98.0
F.; heart rate 58; blood pressure 104/30; respiratory rate
16.  Pulmonary artery pressure 29/11.  Oxygen saturation 98%
on room air.  Generally, the patient was alert, pleasant,
Spanish speaking elderly man with regular rate and rhythm on
heart examination with distant heart sounds.  The patient
with good carotid pulses without bruits.  The patient with
diffuse high pitched wheezes throughout his lung examination
as well as bibasilar crackles.  Physical examination is also
notable for right groin site that was clean and without
hematoma or bruit.  Good distal pulses in all extremities
without edema.  Neurological examination intact.

LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count 7.0,
hematocrit 36, platelets 392.  Chemistry is 142/4.3.  Also
notable for a BUN and creatinine of 15/1.1.  Magnesium 2.3.
The patient's creatinine kinase was 52 with CK MB of 2 and
troponin T of less than 0.01.

ECG showed sinus rhythm at 72 beats per minute with normal
axis and intervals.  [**Street Address(2) 2914**] elevations V1 to V3.  Q
waves in V1 and V2.

Please refer to formal coronary catheterization report for
details on that procedure.

Chest x-ray hyperinflated without opacities or evidence of
heart failure.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 83 year old
Spanish speaking gentleman who lives in [**Male First Name (un) 1056**] and was
visiting his daughter in [**Name (NI) 86**], who presented with
substernal chest pain with ECG finding concerning for
anterolateral ischemia, status post catheterization with
stents to the left anterior descending and left circumflex
coronary arteries.

1.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE STATUS POST STENTS TO THE LEFT
ANTERIOR DESCENDING AND LEFT CIRCUMFLEX:  The patient was
started on aspirin, Plavix and also was given Integrilin
times 18 hours which was renally dosed due to his decreased
creatinine clearance.  The patient was also started on
Metoprolol as well as Captopril.

The patient tolerated the catheterization very well without
incident and had no complaints or anginal symptoms throughout
his hospital stay.  The patient was also started on Lipitor
20 once a day.

PUMP:  The patient with moderately elevated filling pressure
on coronary catheterization, but clinically without any signs
or symptoms of congestive heart failure.  The patient
underwent transthoracic echocardiogram on [**3-28**], which
showed mildly dilated left atrium, mildly dilated left
ventricular cavity as well as severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis and overall severely depressed left ventricular
systolic function without significant valvular issues.
Estimated ejection fraction of 25 to 30%.

As the patient did not have any signs or symptoms of
congestive heart failure, he was just started on an ACE
inhibitor from which he was discharged on.

RHYTHM: The patient is in sinus rhythm on Telemetry without
any major events of Telemetry.

2.  PULMONARY:  Extensive tobacco history with wheezes on
examination and chest x-ray consistent with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.  The patient remained
comfortable and saturated well on room air.  The patient was
given Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers p.r.n.  The patient
had no pulmonary complaints throughout his hospital stay.

3.  RENAL:  The patient denies any history of renal disease
but given his likely low muscle mass, his creatinine is
abnormally high.  The patient's medications, such as
Integrilin, were renally dosed.  The patient also received
gentle intravenous fluids as well as Mucomyst
peri-catheterization.

The patient self diuresed overnight in the Coronary Care Unit
and did not required any diuretic use.  The patient's
creatinine remained stable and was in the low 1.0 range at
discharge.

4.  FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient was
maintained on a cardiac diet which he tolerated well.

5.  ACCESS:  The patient actually with femoral sheath from
catheterization which was discontinued without hematoma or
major blood loss.

6.  PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient was continued on pneumoboots as
well as proton pump inhibitor throughout his hospital stay.

Communication was with the family who was with the patient
and the family daily.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Stable, tolerating p.o., ambulating
and without anginal symptoms.

DISCHARGE STATUS:   To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post stent placement.
2.  Congestive heart failure.
3.  Chronic renal insufficiency.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin 325 once a day.
2.  Plavix 75 once a day for 90 days.
3.  Lipitor 20 once a day.
4.  Albuterol metered dose inhaler as needed.
5.  Lisinopril 10 mg once a day.
6.  Metoprolol sustained release, 75 mg once a day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  The patient is to follow-up with me in Clinic and has an
appointment in [**4-15**].  The patient also has an appointment with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 437**]
of Cardiology in [**Month (only) 958**].
