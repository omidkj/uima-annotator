Pertinent Results:
[**2176-1-10**] Cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant system demonstrated no angiographically significant
coronary disease. The LMCA and RCA were patent. The LAD had a
30% ostial lesion and the LCx had a 30% ostial lesion. 2.
Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normotension.
.
[**2176-1-11**] Echo: PRE-CPB: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). There is
mild AI. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. POST-CPB: There
is a bioprosthetic valve in the aortic position. The valve is
well seated with normally mobile leaflets. There are no
paravalvular leaks and there is no AI. The left ventricular
systolic function remains normal, EF>55%. There is no evidence
of dissection.
.
[**2176-1-13**] CXR: There is a small right pneumothorax. Small right
pleural effusion is new or newly apparent. Right lower lobe
atelectasis has increased. There are low lung volumes.
Post-operative mediastinal widening is unchanged. Moderate
cardiomegaly is stable. Right IJ catheter tip is in the upper
SVC. Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity, a combination of
atelectasis and pleural effusion is stable.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] underwent a cardiac cath on [**1-10**] and following cath
she was admitted for surgical work-up. On [**1-11**] she was brought
to the operating room where she underwent an aortic valve
replacement. Please see operative note for surgical details.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours she was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
Beta-blockers and diuretics were initiated and she was diuresed
towards her pre-op weight. On post-op day two she was
transferred to the step-down floor for further care. Chest tubes
and epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. Chest
x-ray post chest tube removal revealed small right pneumothorax.
On post op day three she was started on antibiotics for a
urinary tract infection. She worked with physical therapy for
strength and mobility. She made good progress and was discharged
to rehab on post-op day for with the appropriate medications and
follow-up appointments.
