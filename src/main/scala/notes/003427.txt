Lotrel / Adhesive Tape

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2140-5-24**] Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 3 (Left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending, Saphenous vein graft to
obtuse marginal, Saphenous vein graft to posterior descending
artery)

History of Present Illness:
This female patient has a past medical history significant for
coronary artery disease s/p myocardial infarction in [**Month (only) **] of
[**2139**] with cardiac catheterization at [**Hospital6 22197**] Center in
[**Location (un) 5583**], MA. She presented with shortness of breath and
found to be in congestive heart failure. Cardiac catheterization
revealed a 60% LAD lesion just after the first diagonal branch,
a 100% stenosis of the RCA with faint bridging collaterals,
severely elevated LVEDP of 35 mmHg, severe anterolateral
hypokinesis, apical dyskinesis, diaphragmatic and posterobasal
akinesis. She was noted to have severely depressed global left
ventricular function with an EF of 30%. She was found to be
anemic while hospitalized, transfused with PRBC's and discharged
to consider bypass surgery. The day after her discharge she saw
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59323**] in follow up and was hospitalized at the Lakes
Regional with a blood pressure of 210/110.  She was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2140-12-18**] for evaluation of her coronary disease and
possible stenting.  Prior to catheterization she was noted to
continue to have a decreased H/H and instead underwent
colonoscopy which revealed a colon mass. Revascularization of
her coronary lesions was deferred until the mass was resected
and she underwent a transverse colectomy for colon cancer on
[**2140-2-12**]. Now she presents for surgical revascularization
following recovery from colectomy.

Social History:

Pertinent Results:
[**5-24**] Echo: Prebypass: 1.No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. 2.There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. Regional left  ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
3. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
4.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. 5.
Mild to moderate ([**1-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen with a
systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg. The jet is posteriorly
directed. The posterior mitral leaflet is slightly restricted.
6. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on
[**2140-5-24**] at 1030am. Post byapss: 1. Patient is A paced and
receiving an infusion of phenylephrine. 2. Biventricular
systolic function is unchanged. 3. Mild mitral regurgitation
present. 4. Aorta intact post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) **] was a same day admit after undergoing pre-operative
work-up as an outpatient. On day of admission she was brought to
the operating room where she underwent a coronary artery bypass
graft x 3. Please see operative report for surgical details.
Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours she was weaned
from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. On
post-op day one she appeared to be doing well and was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further care. Chest tubes
and epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol.  On POD 2
the patient was noted to have a new left facial droop.  CT
revealed an acute infarct of the subcortical area.  Neurology
was consulted and we appreciate the recommendations.  Symptoms
did resolve and the patient was started on full strength aspirin
and plavix- per neurology recommendations.  In addition, she
will follow up with neurology in [**6-20**] weeks.  Postoperative
course was otherwise uneventful.  She was diuresed and beta
blocker was titrated accordingly.  The patient was stable for
discharge on POD 5.
