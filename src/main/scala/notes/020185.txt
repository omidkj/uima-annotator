Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

History of Present Illness:
75 year old male with CAD stent to LAD '[**85**], known 3VD plan for
eventual CABG, DM, PVD recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 40836**] for foot
cellulitis and gangrene, s/p angiogram and R profunda
angioplasty, on antibiotics presented to OSH on [**8-8**] with
shortness of breath for a couple days and tachypnea. He and his
wife were travelling to [**Name (NI) **] when he began to feel SOB. They
stopped for clam chowder, and his symptoms worsened. Due to his
sxs, he presented to the OSH. There, he was hypoxic with a pH of
7.2 and was found to be in CHF exacerbation/pulmonary edema. The
patient was treated with BiPAP and diuresed well. The patient
ruled in for MI with peak MB 16, TropI 10.7. Given his diuresis,
the patient was switched to facemask when he decompensated. He
went into VF requiring 2 shocks. His rhythm returned to sinus.
He was also intubated for airway protection, transfer ABG
7.37/37/62. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was intubated and sedated. EKG
and CXR were performed. The patient was on dopa, amio, heparin
gtt. The dopamine was weaned with poor effect. The patient
dropped his SBP to the 60s. RIJ CVL was placed.
.
Of note, he recently had cardiac cath performed at [**Hospital3 60734**] on [**2188-7-16**] showing diffuse 3VD (left main with ostial
50-60% lesion, LAD with patent stent and mid 60-70 lesion,
distal RCA with 80% lesion - full report below). He was referred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for possible CABG, however, given gangrenous right toe,
he was empirically treated with Vanc, cipro switched to
linezolid, cipro, flagyl (nasal swab w/ MRSA +) and developed
post-cath ATN with creatinine increase to 2.3 which resolved to
baseline. CABG was postponed. Pt was then admitted to vascular
service for RLE angioplasty of profunda, with unsuccessful SFA
angioplasty. Pt was to f/u for further RLE evaluation
.
On review of symptoms, patient intubated, however, no known
history pf CVA, blood clots. All of the other review of systems
were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is now limited [**3-7**] patient intubated
and sedated.

[**2188-8-11**] Echo: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal with moderate global
hypokinesis (LVEF 30%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are moderately thickened. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.6cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation may be present. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis c/w
diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, cannot fully exclude
multivessel CAD, but less likely). Mild aortic valve stenosis.
Increased LVEDP.

[**2188-8-11**] CXR: A single portable radiograph of the chest
demonstrates an endotracheal tube present with its tip located 3
cm above the level of the carina. There is a nasogastric tube
present with its tip in the stomach. There are bilateral pleural
effusions, worse on the left than the right. Increased airspace
opacity involving both lungs is present. No pneumothorax.
Trachea is midline. Aorta is calcified.

[**2188-8-16**] CXR: The endotracheal tube tip is 2.4 cm above the
carina. The left IJ line tip is in the superior vena cava. The
NG tube tip cannot be adequately visualized. There is a large
left greater than right pleural effusion that is increased in
size compared to prior. There is bilateral hazy vasculature
consistent with fluid overload. The overall impression is that
of worsening CHF and worsening effusions compared to the prior
study.

[**2188-8-19**] CXR: No evidence of intubation. Tip of left jugular CV
line overlies proximal SVC. No pneumothorax. There is opacity at
the left base consistent with atelectasis, with the previously
noted bibasilar opacities on the study of [**2188-8-17**]
improved. No pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old male with CAD, known 3VD, planned for CABG presented
to OSH in CHF, where he had a questionable VFib arrest
requringing 2 shocks into NSR and loaded on amiodarone.  He was
intubated at OSH for hypoxia and acidosis.  He was then
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], diuresed 15L and then extubated on
[**2188-8-16**].
.
NSTEMI/CAD. Prior to hospital admission, patient was being
planned for CABG as he was found to have diffuse 3VD by a
cardiac cath at [**Hospital3 **] on [**7-16**].  The cath showed left main
osteal 50-60% lesion, LAD with patent stent and mid 60-70% mid
lesion, and distal RCA with 80% lesion).  An EKG on admission to
OSH showed with persistent ST depressions.  Cardiac enzymes
trending up at OSH (Troponin I 10.7 on [**8-9**]). The elevated
troponins were thought to be due to demand ischemia rather than
ACS.  He was treated with aspirin and statin.  Due to
