ETT tube when Profol off for 5 minutes
Does not follow commands, however moves all extremities with

bilaterally.

Alert and oriented x 3. PERRL, EOMs intact.
Decreased hearing. No hemotympanum at this time.
Face symmetric, tongue midline.
No drift.
Full strength and sensation throughout.


Pertinent Results:
CT Head [**2111-11-19**]
1. Bilateral inferior frontal contusion with surrounding edema.
Probable
small amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage along the right inferior
frontal
convexity.
2. Possible subarachnoid hemorrhage in the vermis and subdural
hemorrhage
along the tentorium.
3. Complex right mastoid air cell fracture and possible occult
left temporal bone fracture given opacification of the bilateral
mastoid air cells. Inner ear structures intact.

CT C-spine [**2111-11-19**]
1. No acute cervical injury or malalignment. If there is
clinical concern
for ligamentous injury or instability, MRI may be performed for
further
evaluation.

CT sinus [**2111-11-19**]
Evidence of left sphenoid fracture, with air-fluid level and
mucosal thickening at the left sphenoid recess, the fracture
apparently is
located anterior to the carotid canal as described in detail
above,
correlation with CTA is recommended if clinically warranted to
rule out a
possible vascular injury. The previously described possible
fracture at the left frontal roof, possibly represents a
vascular canal since this area appears well corticated with no
evidence of soft tissue edema. Again, frontal hemorrhagic
contusions nasal septum deviation towards the right are
visualized, the patient is intubated.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Known lastname 63643**]  was admitted to the ICU at [**Hospital1 18**] in an
intubated state. She was found to have bilateral frontal
contusions with edema. When off sedation she would move all
extremities purposefully. Serial head CT's remained stable. On
[**2111-11-20**] she was weaned toward extubation. She was febrile to
>102. A fever workup was initiated. A chest X-ray showed a left
and probable right opacity. She was started on Levaquin for this
and an E. Coli UTI. She was transfered to the floor and her
mental status continued to improve. She was without seizure
activity and corrected dilantin levels were therapeutic. Her
cervical collar was cleared on [**2111-11-23**] with a reliable exam and
negative CT C-spine. Her repeat chest xray on [**11-23**] confirmed that
she had pneumonia but her WBC and her temperature were both
improving.

She was seen by PT/OT on [**11-23**] and they continued to work with her
until [**11-25**] because they felt that she would improve with a couple
more inpatient visits. She did improve and both PT and OT felt
that she was safe to be discharged with both therapies continued
in the outpatient setting on [**11-25**].

Social Work was consulted and they felt that the patient was
coping well with her injuries and that she was happy and felt
safe at home with her husband.

On [**11-24**] and [**11-25**] the patient had a subtherapeutic dilantin level
so she was discharged on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis.
Additionally she had some hearing loss throughout her hospital
stay and had hemotympanum upon arrival. Therefore she will have
an audiogram and an ENT appointment as an outpatient.

The patient's mental status improved while she was hospitalized
and her CT scans showed stable hemorrhage and cerebral edema.
She was voiding on her own, taking in food without difficulty,
and ambulating. She was discharged to home on [**11-25**].
