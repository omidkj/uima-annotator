Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness and fatigue, bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Permanent pacemaker placement
Central Venous Line


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with a PMH of HTN, heart failure, and mitral
regurgitation on metoprolol feeling unwell since this am with
nausea and dizziness. She has felt weak and tired all day. She
states she was feeling well last night. She denies any recent
illnesses. She was found to be very bradycardic, and EMS was
called. She lives at the [**Hospital3 537**] and recieves her care
there. They found her to be hypotensive with bradycardia to the
30's. On arrival to the ED she was found to he normotensive with
SBP's in the 130's and HR in 30s.
.
Of note, the patient was recently hospitalized [**2135-7-7**] for a
compression fracture after a fall. She had a burst fracture of
L1 and a compression fracture of L5. She was presrcibed a TLSO
brace with tylenol and ultram for pain control. She was
discharged to a rehabilitation facility.
.
On the floor she was feeling very tired, with nausea and
vomiting. She did not have any chest pain, though she was
feeling short of breath. She denied lightheadedness. Her vitals
remained consistent with the emergency department. HR in the
30's, BP's in the 110-130s, and oxygenation of 98-100% on 4L NC.

.
On review of systems, She was having significant fatigue and
"weakness" today with some nausea and feeling "ill". She vomited
in the ED as well as on the floor (guiac positive, coffee
grounds). She She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of
the other review of systems were negative.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were HR 36, BP 123/39, RR 18, she was
nauseus and dizzy. Life pads were placed, she was put on a
cardiac monitor and 4L NC. Her EKG showed complete heart block.
She was nauseus with shortness of breath and vomiting while in
the ED. She was given 500cc bolus of NS, 1 mg atropine, 1 mg
glucagon, 2amp calcium gluconate, 4mg zofran x 3, and
2mcg/kg/min of dopamine, with limited effect. Her vitals
remained with a heart rate in the 30's, normo-hypertensive,
satting well on 4L NC.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2135-9-23**]
SINGLE AP SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Cardio-mediastinal and hilar
contours are normal. The lungs are clear. Mild blunting of the
left lateral costophrenic sulcus suggests a small left pleural
effusion. No pneumothorax is detected.
IMPRESSION: Possible small left pleural effusion. No other acute

cardiopulmonary pathology.
.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2135-9-24**]
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). The aortic valve is not well
seen. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification. There
is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 4mmHg) due to
mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

compared to the film from the prior evening. Compared to the
