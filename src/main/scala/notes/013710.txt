Service:  Medicine

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Weakness and lethargy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 80-year-old Caucasian
male with a past medical history significant for hypertension
and atrial fibrillation who was recently admitted from
[**2185-11-6**] to [**2185-11-9**] with syncope thought
to be secondary to dehydration.

He returned to the [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Department with the acute onset of weakness and an
inability to get out of bed.

The patient had been in his usual state of health until the
morning of presentation to the Emergency Department.  He had
noted fecal incontinence associated with urination
(approximately six to seven times per day for the past five
to six days) and now two to three times per day for the past
two days.  He awoke on the morning of presentation with
urinary and fecal incontinence during the night.

In the Emergency Department, his blood pressure was found to
be 89/54 initially responsive to intravenous fluids.
However, despite giving three liters of intravenous fluids
his blood pressure remained 85 to 115/50 to 60.  He also
continued to be tachycardic in the low 100s.  He was given
500 mg intravenously of Levaquin times one for a question of
urosepsis, given that the urinalysis showed positive
leukocyte esterase.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   On review of systems, the patient
complained of chills, but no fevers.  He denied any rigors,
decrease in oral intake, chest pain, shortness of breath,
headache, nuchal rigidity, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
lower extremity edema, urinary symptoms, bright red blood per
rectum, and melena.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation; status post VVI pacemaker.
2.  Polymyalgia rheumatica.
3.  Recent admission for syncope.
4.  Anal fistula repair.
5.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
6.  Depression.
7.  Hypertension (since [**2166**]).
8.  Status post pneumonia in [**2181**] (hospitalized).

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
3.  Hytrin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
4.  Lanoxin 125 mcg p.o. q.d.
5.  Prednisone 2.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.
6.  Proscar 5 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  QUINIDINE.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is widowed.  He lives alone.  He
has one daughter.  The patient has a 62-pack-year tobacco
history; but he quit many years ago.  One drink per day.  A
former marketing manager.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history was noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed vital signs with a temperature of 97, heart rate was
107 and irregular, blood pressure was 89/54, respiratory rate
was 21, and oxygen saturation was 99% on 3 liters.  In
general, the patient was a very mildly obese Caucasian male
lying in bed.  He appeared very weak.  Mucous membranes were
dry.  Poor skin turgor.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed pupils were equal, round, and reactive
to light and accommodation.   Extraocular movements were
intact.  The oropharynx was clear.  No lymphadenopathy.  No
jugular venous distention.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed heart sounds poorly heard.  Normal first heart sound
and second heart sound.  A quiet systolic murmur.  Lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen revealed
normal active bowel sounds.  Soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  No masses.  Extremity examination revealed no
cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Neurologic examination
revealed alert and oriented times four.  No focal signs.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 13.8 (with 81% neutrophils, 13% lymphocytes,
and 5% monocytes), hematocrit was 37.4, platelets were 236,
and mean cell volume was 90.  Sodium was 135, potassium was
4.8, chloride was 100, bicarbonate was 20, blood urea
nitrogen was 30, creatinine was 3, and blood glucose was 100.
Anion gap was 15.  Urinalysis revealed large leukocyte
esterase.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray revealed pacemaker in
place.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.

Electrocardiogram revealed irregularly irregular, rate of
122, normal QRS, normal axis.  T wave inversions in V2 to V3.
Biphasic T waves in V4 through V6.  Question of
pseudonormalization.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   In short, This is an
80-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history
significant for atrial fibrillation, polymyalgia rheumatica,
hypertension, and recent admission for syncope secondary to
dehydration who presented with weakness, incontinence,
multiple bowel movements, and hypotension.

1.  HEMODYNAMIC ISSUES:  The patient was observed to be very
dry on admission.  He had very dry mucous membranes, poor
skin turgor, hypotension, and tachycardia.  He was thought to
be very volume depleted.

Because the patient did not respond to fluids initially, he
was sent to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Eventually,
after receiving more than four to five liters of fluid, the
patient's blood pressure rebounded, and he was not nearly as
tachycardic.

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  (a)  Pericardial effusion:  Of
note, during the [**Hospital 228**] Medical Intensive Care Unit stay,
he received a transthoracic echocardiogram to evaluate his
cardiac function.

An echocardiogram from [**2185-11-22**] showed an ejection
fraction of 45%, mild global left ventricular dysfunction,
and a moderate-to-large circumferential pericardial effusion
with a circumference of 2.5 cm.  The right ventricle was
noted to be unusually small, and "stranding" was seen
laterally; consistent with organization/chronicity of
effusion.  The echocardiogram also showed 1+ aortic
regurgitation, 1+ mitral regurgitation, and 1 to 2+ tricuspid
regurgitation.

Because of the new effusion, the patient received a Swan-Ganz
catheter.  The right atrial pressure was 22.  The right
ventricular pressure was 41/22.  The pulmonary artery
pressure was 45/30, and the pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure was 30.  The relative equalization of diastolic
pressures was worrisome for tamponade physiology.

The patient next underwent a pericardiocentesis.  300 cc of
fresh bloody fluid with clots was retrieved.  Analysis showed
greater than one million red blood cells and [**Pager number **] white blood
cells.  There were no organisms visualized, and the culture
was negative.  The patient's initial pericardial pressure was
measured at 15.  This went down to 6 after the
pericardiocentesis.  Because it did not go down to 1, it was
surmised that the patient's effusion was chronic in nature.
This was consistent with the stranding seen on
echocardiogram.  Eventually, the patient's pericardial
pressure came down further, and his chamber pressures
normalized.

In terms of the etiology of the patient's pericardial
effusion, it was most likely secondary to his polymyalgia
rheumatica and chronic in nature.  The patient had an
erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 70, and a borderline
rheumatoid factor.

Of note, the patient's INR was also noted to be as high as
5.9.  This may have been the trigger in addition to minor
trauma.  Otherwise, it was still possible that this effusion
was idiopathic in nature.  It was very unlikely that the
patient's effusion was post myocardial infarction in nature,
as the patient ruled out.

In terms of infectious causes, the patient had a negative
purified protein derivative, and no organisms were seen in
the effusion.  In terms of malignant causes, cytology
revealed no malignant cells.  Of note, the patient is being
worked up for possible colon cancer given the recent finding
of colonic thickening on abdominal computed tomography.

Repeat transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2185-11-24**]
revealed only a small pericardial effusion.  There were no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.  In comparison to the
transthoracic echocardiogram on [**2185-11-22**]; most of the
pericardial fluid has been removed.

(b)  Pump:  Because of the aggressive volume resuscitation at
the beginning of the patient's admission, the patient went
into mild congestive heart failure.  After receiving low
doses of intravenous Lasix, the patient cleared his lungs of
any fluid.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient initially
