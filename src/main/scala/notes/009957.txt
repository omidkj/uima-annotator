Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**3-6**]/7 under the care of
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**].  The left arm PICC line was removed and a
peripheral IV was placed for PPN.  Labs revealed WBC count at
3.2, Neut% at 72; Hct 21.6.  Albumin was low at 2.5. Neupogen
and Epogen were given. Bactrim IV was continued to cover his
previous source of septicemia.  Blood cultures and line tip
culture were pending. Urine was negative for infection.
Ultrasound of left upper extremity where PICC removed was read
as having retained fragment, however the PICC was verified as
being intact and there was no introducer sheath used at initial
insertion. No clots were identified.  A repeat xray of the arm
was negative for foreign body.

At HD 2 WBC was increased to 23.2 and there was no change in the
Hct in response to the Epogen.

At HD 3 he continued to have fever spikes. It was decided that
Neupogen would not be continued due to its past effects on his
skin syndrome/Sweet's syndrome. Epogen was continued with no
effect. He was very weak this admission and had difficulty
eating.  PPN was provided.  Blood cultures and PICC line tip
culture were negative. C. difficile was negative.

At HD 4 he continued with fevers and rigors. The old PICC site
cellulitis had improved. Repeat blood cultures were sent. Chest
xray showed some consolidation at the medial right lung base.
Infectious disease and Hem/Onc were consulted.  Per
recommendations Bactrim was discontinued and Cefepime was
started for empiric coverage. Flagyl was also started to combat
possible c. difficile. Irradiated PRBCs were transfused for Hct
of 20.3.

At HD 5 repeat CXR showed resolution of
consolidation/aspiration.  Tests for CMV, EBV, Cryptococcal
antigen, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Legionella, MRSA were
negative.  Repeat blood cultures were negative.  He continued to
have fever at 102.4.  We discussed placing a nasojejunal tube
for temporary feedings, as he was not taking in adequate
calories (411 kcal and 14g protein/day) due to difficulty
swallowing.  However, he decided against this option at the
time.  Paxil was started for depression.

At HD 8 he had not spiked a fever within 24 hours.  Hibiclens
wash was provided, and he was taken to the operating room for
Hickman placement per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  He tolerated the procedure
well and was returned to the floor.  TPN was resumed after
verification of Hickman placement. WBC count was down to 2.3;
Hct was 21.0 from 24.7 post-transfusion. Red cell morphology
revealed [**Doctor Last Name 30674**] formation. Hem/Onc planned to review peripheral
smear.  Hemolysis labs were WNL.

At HD 10 he continued to be afebrile on Cefepime/Flagyl.  He was
weak and was unable to ingest adequate calories.  Albumin was
2.4 and Transferrin was 88.  TPN calories

At HD 15 CXR showed left pleural effusion. He was transfused for
a Hct of 21.2.  Lasix was given with blood and he experienced
incontinence over night.  A condom cath was provided. CEA was
1.1.

At HD 16 he was febrile to 101.5.  Cultures were sent.  Flomax
was started for urinary retention. Sputum culture was positive
for MRSA and pseudomonas.  Antibiotics were changed to
Vancomycin/Meropenem. He had difficulty eating and there was
concern for aspiration.  He was made NPO.

At HD 22 he continued to have episodes of fever.  He was also
very weak and was incontinent of urine requiring condom
catheter. Blood/urine cultures were negative.  Repeat cultures
were sent.

At HD 23 CXR showed a left pleural effusion. He developed left
eye swelling consistent with previous episodes of skin lesions.
Opthamology evaluated and treated for conjunctivitis with good
response. WBC count was 10.1; Hct 24.5.  He continued to be
febrile to 102.6. Zosyn replaced Meropenem per ID
recommendation. IVIG was given.

At HD 26 Neurology was asked to see him regarding pronounced
tremors and mild confusion.  Liver enzymes were elevated from
normal with T. Bili at 3.3. RUQ ultrasound showed no biliary
ductal dilatation or evidence of acute cholecystitis;polyps or
sludge balls within the gallbladder; and enlarged spleen with
unusual configuration. There was no evidence of subphrenic
abscess. Ammonia level was WNL. Urinary and serum copper levels
were sent to r/o Wilson's disease.

At HD 27 neuro recommended MRI w/ lumbar puncture to evaluate
for carcinomatous meningitis.  GI medicine consulted and wanted
to treat empirically for herpetic hepatitis with Acyclovir. He
continued on Vancomycin and Zosyn. He remained afebrile. Small
bowel tissue was requested from outside pathology to evaluate
for vasculitis/amyloid but were unable to be located.

At HD 28 Bilirubin was decreased to 2.6. Sincalide was started
for cholestasis. Hct was 20.6 and 2 units PRBCs were given. HIV
test was negative.

At HD 30 serum copper was elevated at 1429. Urinary copper was
elevated at >700ml.  Opthamology was consulted to evaluate for
[**Doctor Last Name 21721**]-[**Last Name (un) 23070**] rings and this was negative. Repeat urine copper
was sent. Trace elements were removed from TPN.

At HD 31 Liver consult felt that the elevated copper was related
to TPN.  Ursodiol was started for cholestasis.

At HD 32 Hct was 21.3. Bilirubin was 2.2. Liver enzymes were
elevated, but trending down from initial elevation.

During hospitalization he was transferred to the ICU for
episodes of atrial fibrillation which were controlled via IV and
PO amiodarone. He continued with mild tremors, photophobia and
neck stiffness.  A head/cervical MRI was completed which showed
disc protrusion and osteophytes at C3/4 resulting in compression
of the spinal cord with associated cord edema; moderate
narrowing of the left neural foramen at C7/T1; and multiple
enhancing lymph nodes in the left deep cervical chain.  Neuro
was consulted and recommended soft collar which was placed when
in chair or ambulating.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] [**Name (STitle) 69047**] a FNA of the
enlarged cervical nodes under ultrasound and this was negative
for culture/pathology.

He continued to require RBC transfusions to maintain Hct.  He
became progressively debilitated with periods of confusion.  He
continued with intermittent fevers.  Blood Cx (-). PNA waxed and
waned as he was not mobilizing secretions. Sputum was
(+)pseudomonas, MRSA, GNR.

At HD 55 his abdomen was tender and he had watery output from
ostomy. C. diff was negative. KUB was (-) for obstruction or
pneumatosis. He was hydrated for possible ischemic colitis.

A RUQ ultrasound was reevaluated which showed gallbladder wall
edema and sludge with ? cholecystitis, and increased liver
echogenicity.

At HD 65 he had ? aspiration which required ventilatory support.
 He was transferred to the unit and intubated. During his ICU
stay he was febrile. He was hypotensive and was supported with
Albumin/fluid resuscitation.

After much discussion with his wife it was decided to make the
patient CMO. On [**2133-5-21**] he died.
