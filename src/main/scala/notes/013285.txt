diagnosis suggesting cancer recurrence, recently seen in
thoracic clinic with cough and shortness of breath and
prescribed levofloxacin for presumed bronchitis ([**2148-3-28**]), now
presenting with increasing dyspnea and cough.  Patient reports
cough is chronic for past 2 months, although worsening since
hospitalization with yellow, non-bloody sputum production.
Patient denies fevers and chills but states that he is unable to
walk more than a few feet.  Prior to the PE, patient was able to
walk 200 feet but was started on 2L NC at time of discharge.
Patient states that his shortness of breath has been progressive
and not acute.  Of note, patient has been taking levofloxacin
with sputum becoming less yellow and a one time episode of
nausea following dinner last night.

Initial vital signs on presentation to [**Hospital1 18**] ED were HR132
84%onRA.  EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia to 120s.  Labs were
remarkable for WBC 11.7 (90N), Hct 33.6, Plt 171, Na 132, Cr
1.2, BUN 69, INR 4.0, Lactate 1.6, BNP 437.  CXR showed
increased consolidation of RLL suggestive of infection.  Case
was discussed with thoracic surgery, who felt that MICU
admission was warranted. Patient was given vanco, ceftriaxone
for treatment of presumed pnuemonia.

FINDINGS: Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates complete

Preliminary Reportopacification of the left hemithorax and
leftward cardiomediastinal shift
Preliminary Reportconsistent with post-pneumonectomy change. The
right lung demonstrates
Preliminary Reportincreased consolidation in the lower lobe and
possibly also the middle lobe
Preliminary Reportsuggestive of infection. This distribution
would be atypical for edema.
Preliminary ReportThere is no pneumothorax or large right
effusion.

Preliminary ReportIMPRESSION:
Preliminary Report1. Stable post-pneumonectomy changes in the
left lung.
Preliminary Report2. Right lower lung consolidation, suggestive
of new infection.


Brief Hospital Course:
59yo M PMHx Stage IV NSLC s/p L pneumonectomy ([**7-/2147**]) with
recurrence in supraclavicular node, recent diagnosis of PE
([**3-/2148**]) on coumadin, and pneumonia.

# Hypoxia
Stage IV lung cancer with nodal recurrance recently s/p L
pneumonectomy, as well as a new right sided pneumonia. Admitted
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and started on IV vanc/zosyn/levaquin for HCAP.
Anticoag was held for elevated INR, but PE was likely a
contributing factor to hypoxia. Very high oxygen requirements,
with desats with any movement. Vancomycin was stopped with no
evidence of MRSA. Levaquin stopped after 6 days. Zosyn continued
for 10 days. Lasix attempted for diuresis without improvement,
and worsening of congestion. No improvement in oxygenation over
the course of about a week. Palliative care consult was called
and patient and family decided to pursue hospice, while
continuing to treat pneumonia and PE. Lab draws, vitals, and
non-comfort medications were stopped. Patient was called out to
the floor. Overnight he became much less responsive, and his
work of breathing increased. Antibiotics were stopped and a
morphine drip and glycopyrrolate were started. He was seen by
the Catholic chaplain and received the anointing of the sick
with his family present.

Mr.[**Known lastname 32665**] passed away peacefully on the afternoon of [**2148-4-7**]
with his family at his bedside.
