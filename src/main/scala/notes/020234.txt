History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old male who was recently admitted
after gastrocutaneous fistula takedown on [**2160-6-11**] that was
complicated by small medial fascial dehiscence treated with
wound vac. He was discharged to rehab on
[**6-21**] and returned to clinic today for post-operative checkup and
was noted to have increase in size of the dehiscence and was
directly admitted to the surgical service for observation. He
reports mild pain over wound site that has been improving. His
appetite is improving. He denies any fever/chills, nausea,
vomiting, or change in ostomy output/character. He last received
[**Month/Year (2) 2286**] yesterday via his left radiocephalic fistula without
complications.

Brief Hospital Course:
62M admitted after gastrocutaneous fistula takedown on [**2160-6-11**]
that was complicated by small medial fascial dehiscence treated
with wound vac. He was now admitted for wound management. Wound
vac was changed on Mondays and Thursdays only with white sponge
placed first to cover small area of exposed cauterized liver
then black sponge.
Coumadin was continued. Hemodialysis per home HD schedule
(M-W-F). INR  was noted to be rising up to 3.7 and warfarin was
held. This value continued to rise and the warfarin was held for
7 days before being restarted on home dose.

He experienced bladder spasms with penile pain with sense of
urinary urgency (doesn't make urine)that persisted. He then had
purulent/bloody appearing drainage from his penis. Urology was
consulted and oxybutinin was suggested for spasm control. This
was started with some relief of symptoms, however he started
became confused with occasional hallucinations. Oxybutinin was
stopped.

A full ID evaluation of potential causes including GC/Chlamydia
(negative) and HSV (negative) were performed. Culture on the
discharge revealed E coli, and a cystoscopy was done on [**7-8**]
showing Vesiculoenteric fistula between the bladder dome and
small bowel in the right hemipelvis and also a Coloenteric
fistula extending between the small bowel and the distal
colon/rectum. Unasyn was started on [**7-6**], CT done on [**7-10**] also
showed  a fistulous tract from the anterior abscess to the
ileocolic anastomosis in the right lower quadrant. Air was noted
within the bladder, likely demonstrating a  connection to the
bladder resulting in a vesicoenteric fistula at this level.

GI was consulted and an ileoscopy and rectal scope was performed
on [**7-11**] after FFP and Vit K for reversal of INR. Several biopsies
were taken with results as follows:

Ileum, biopsy: Intestinal mucosa with surface denudation, tissue
distortion precludes full interpretation.
Anastomosis, biopsy: Colonic mucosa, within normal limits.
Rectum, biopsy: Colonic mucosa with focal lamina propria
hyalinization, otherwise unremarkable.

Given these findings, Unasyn continued for a total of 15 days.
The cultures obtained from the bladder at the time of the
cystoscopy isolated E coli. All blood cultures have been
negative and he has been afebrile. Penile/bladder pain abated.

During this time period he was also noted to have subtherapeutic
INR, as he required FFP so that biopsies could be obtained. He
was started on a heparin drip for sub-therapeutic INR. INR was
3.0 on [**7-20**] and heparin gtt was stopped. Coumadin continued.

On [**7-12**] the patient received one unit of RBCs in hemodialysis for
blood noted in both ostomy and rectally. A CT was done, and
patient had evidence of hematoma near the biopsy site
The patient was transferred to the SI
