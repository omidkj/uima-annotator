HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old
woman status post bilateral nephrectomy and on hemodialysis,
status post a DVT with IVC filter placement, who was at
[**Hospital3 7**] recuperating from her nephrectomy surgery,
and over the past week had developed mild left upper
extremity weakness. Workup included a MRI scan at [**Hospital3 9717**] which showed a right subdural hematoma in the right
cerebral hemisphere and right frontal subdural hygroma. The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for further management.

nephrectomy in [**2093**], status post DVT with SVC filter
placement, she is HIT positive, breast cancer, MI in [**2106**],
hepatitis A and B.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Her temperature is 98.1,
heart rate is 89, BP is 157/72, respiratory rate is 18,
saturation is 96% on room air. Awake, alert, and oriented x 3

edema. Muscle strength is [**4-21**] except for the left upper
extremity which is [**3-22**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the ICU for
close neurologic observation. The renal service was consulted
due to her need for hemodialysis. The patient was evaluated
by the neurosurgical service and felt to require bur hole
drainage of the subdural hematoma. The patient was seen by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**] and prepared for surgery.

On [**2107-3-14**] the patient underwent a right frontal
parietal craniotomy bur hole drainage of a subdural hematoma
without intraoperative complication. Postoperatively, the
patient had no complaints of headache. She reported improved
dexterity in the left hand. Vital signs were stable, and her
strength was [**4-21**] in all muscle groups. She had no drift. Her
face was symmetric. Her dressing was clean, dry, and intact.
She was transferred to the regular floor on postoperative day
1. Her subdural drain was removed. She had a repeat head CT
which showed good evacuation of the subdural. She continued
to be followed by the renal service and undergo every other
day renal dialysis. She was evaluated by the physical therapy
and occupational therapy service and felt to be safe for
discharge to home with home PT and OT. Her condition was
stable, and a repeat head CT prior to discharge showed a
stable condition of the evacuation of her subdural hematoma.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  She was discharged on [**2107-3-18**] with
