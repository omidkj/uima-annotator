Social History:
Social history is significant for current tobacco use (1 pack

Family History:
Non-contributory.

Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 94/65 mm Hg while supine, intubated/sedated.
Pulse was 64 beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 15
breaths/min.
Generally the patient was well developed, well nourished.

There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple with
JVP of 7 cm. The carotid waveform was normal. There was no
thyromegaly. The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis. The respirations were not labored and there were no
use of accessory muscles. The lungs were clear to ascultation
bilaterally with normal breath sounds and no adventitial sounds
or rubs.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The heart sounds revealed a normal
S1 and the S2 was normal. There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks or
gallops.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was soft nontender
and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor, cyanosis,
clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal, femoral or carotid
bruits. Inspection and/or palpation of skin and subcutaneous
tissue showed no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

ECG ([**2193-4-15**]):
Sinus rhythm
Consider left atrial abnormality
Consider left ventricular hypertrophy and possible biventricular
hypertrophy
Nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay
ST-T wave abnormalities with probable QT interval prolonged
although is
difficult to measure - cannot exclude in part ischemia or
drug/metabolic/electrolyte effect
Since previous tracing of [**2192-9-18**], inferior myocardial
infarction less evident

CXR ([**2193-4-15**]):
Irregular opacification at the base of the right lung could
represent pneumonia. There is also a linear opacity more
laterally in the right mid lung, likely atelectasis or scar.
Upper lungs are clear. The patient has had median sternotomy and
coronary bypass grafting. The right hilus is enlarged but has a
vascular appearance. There is no evidence elsewhere of central
adenopathy. Heart size is normal, and there is no pleural
effusion. Endotracheal tube is in standard placement.

CARDIAC CATH ([**2193-4-15**]):
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system
demonstrated 3 vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically
apparent flow-limiting disease.  The LAD was occluded at the
ostium.
The LCx had an OM with a 40% mid-vessel stenosis.  The RCA was
occluded
proximally and filled distally by left to right collaterals.
2. Graft angiography demonstrated a SVG-Diagonal with a
thrombotic
occlusion in the proximal segment.  The SVG-OM and SVG-PDA had
stump
occlusions.
3. Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated a patent LIMA-LAD.
4. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal systemic
arterial
pressure with a BP of 108/60 mmHg.
5. The lesion in the SVG-Diagonal was treated with thrombectomy,

stenting using a 3.5 mm Cypher stent and post dilation with a
4.0 mm
balloon. Final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual
stenosis,
no residual thrombus, no dissection and no embolization. (See
PTCA
comments)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Thrombotic occlusion of the SVG-Diagonal.
3. Occluded SVG-OM and SVG-PDA.
4. Patent LIMA-LAD.
5. Succesful stenting of the SVG-Diagonal lesion with Cypher
stent.

ECHO ([**2193-4-16**]):
The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis
of the septum, and anterior wall. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (?#) are moderately thickened. There is
mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2) and trivial aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular dysfunction consistent
with coronary disease. Mild aortic stenosis. Mild mitral
regurgitation.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. NSTEMI:
Patient presented with chest pain that was worse than his usual
chest wall pain and was refractory to percocet.  EKG and cardiac
enzymes were consistent with a NSTEMI.  He presented on heparin
and ASA/Plavix; integrillin was added and he was taken to the
cath lab.

Cardiac cath showed the SVG-Diagonal graft with a thrombotic
occlusion in the proximal segment - this was stented using a 3.5
mm Cypher stent and post dilation with a 4.0 mm balloon.  Final
angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis, no
residual thrombus, no dissection and no embolization.  Of note
the patient became very combative prior to the intervention and
asked to terminate
