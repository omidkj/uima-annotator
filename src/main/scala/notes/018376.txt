Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
fatigue and bradycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacemaker placement


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 65 year old woman with multiple medical
problems most notably CHF (EF 40-45%), DM2, seizure disorder,
multiple admissions for bradycardia presenting with bradycardia.
She was just discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2133-5-4**] at which time she
presented with bradycardia and weakness. At that time the
bradycardia was junctional escape and self resolved during the
hospital stay. Per discharge notes, the bradycardia was
attributed to Zoloft which was held on admission and removed
from her medication list. The patient states that she has not
taken any of the Zoloft or her prior metoprolol which had been
discontinued in [**1-24**] after being admitted with bradycardia.
When returning home from breakfast she noted progressive
weakness. She also had sudde onset of shortness of breath and
right sided chest pain. The pain happened both at rest and with
exertion. The pain was worse with deep breathing. The pain
radiated to her neck and both shoulders. The pain was a
tightness. She noted that she was so weak that she could only
take a nap. When her boyfriend found her she was too weak to
transfer to her wheelchair, so EMS was called. She states that
she takes all of her medications daily with the help of a nurse
who lays them out for her in medication boxes. She denies
getting confused and taking extra doses of medication. She
states that she took her blood sugar this morning but does not
remember the value.
.
Initial vital signs in the ED were [**Age over 90 **]F 36 117/61 12 99%RA. An
EKG showed junctional bradycardia @30-40 with no ischemic
changes seen.
A head CT was unremarkable.
.
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, black stools or red stools. She denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. She has no dysuria or abdominal pain.
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
65 year old woman with MMP and prior hx of bradycardia
previously attributed to medications who presented with
symptomatic junctional bradycardia (HR 35 bpm) on no AV nodal
agents.
.
# Rhythm:
Pt was admitted with a junctional bradycardia that spontaneously
converted to sinus bradycardia. After multiple admissions for
symptomatic bradycardia attributed to medications (Zoloft,
metoprolol), on this admission it was determined that pt likely
had sick sinus syndrome due tointrinsic SA nodal failure. An
ischemic trigger was ruled out by negative cardiac enzymes and a
recent TSH was normal. The patient was monitored on telemetry
and received a dual-chamber pacemaker on [**6-2**].  The patient did
not experience any episodes of bradycardia or arrhythmia
following pacemaker placement. The patient was discharged with a
short course of clindamycin following pacemaker placement.
.
# UTI:
Pt developed urinary retention on day 1 of admission and the
urine culture grew gram negative rods. The patient was treated
with aztreonam empirically due to multiple drug allergies, and
when sensitivities were available it was confirmed by telephone
with the clinical lab that the pt's E. coli UTI was sensitive to
aztreonam.  The patient completed a 3-day course of aztreonam.
.
# CHF/Pump:
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2130-9-8**] calculated LVEF 35%. The
patient remained euvolemic during admission.
.
# CAD:
EKG from admission demonstrated no significant ST changes
compared with prior dated [**2133-5-1**]. Cardiac enzymes were
negative.  The patient was continued on aspirin.
.
# Hypertension:
HCTZ and lisinopril were started and the patient's blood
pressure tolerated the medications.
.
# DM2:
The patient was continued on her home dose of insulin.
.
# Seizure Disorder:
The patient was continued on her home Tegretol for her history
of seizure disorder.  The patient did not experience any seizure
activity during the hospitalization.
.
# FEN:
The patient followed a diabetic, heart-healthy diet.
.
# Code: full
