IMAGING:
[**2164-1-11**] CT head: 1. Minimal interval change in acute left
midbrain hemorrhage, now measuring 10 mm compared to 11 mm
previously. 2. Right temporal subarachnoid, intraparenchymal and
possible small subdural hematoma unchanged appearance. 3.
Hyperdense focus in the left frontal vertex may represent a
vessel; however, small focus of hemorrhage is not excluded.
.
[**2164-1-11**] CXR: Multiple left rib fractures. Subcutaneous emphysema
in right chest wall.
.
[**2164-1-11**] CT head: 1.1 cm focus of left brainstem acute
hemorrhage. Right temporal subarachnoid, intraparenchymal and
possible small subdural hematoma.
.
[**2164-1-11**] CT torso: Suboptimal reformatted images of the
thoracolumbar spine. If high clinical concern for spine
fracture, consider repeat study of the thoracolumbar spine. 2.
Left 2nd-7th rib fractures. Comminuted left clavicle fracture.
3. Right 1st rib costochondral diastasis, with associated
subcutaneous emphysema. Small right pneumothorax. 4. No evidence
of acute visceral injury in the abdomen or pelvis.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma service. Neurosurgery was
consulted; he was admitted to the Trauma ICU where frequent
neurologic checks and serial head CT scans were followed. He was
loaded with Dilantin and remained on it for 10 days for seizure
prophylaxis; there were no seizures reported during his hospital
stay. His current mental status is awake, alert with
intermittent confusion likely related to delirium. He was given
intermittent doses of Ativan and Haldol for this. It is being
recommended that antipsychotic be used to treat his delirium vs.
benzodiazepines as this can worsen delirium.

He had chest tubes placed initially for his pneumothorax and
those have since been removed. Last chest xray on [**1-21**] revealed
some atelectasis; he is prescribed nebulizers prn.

He was also seen by ENT for left hemotympanum; he was prescribed
ear drops and should follow up with ENT as an outpatient.

The Pain Service was consulted for epidural analgesia due to his
rib fractures but recommended intravenous narcotics given that
at the time his cervical spine had not been cleared. He is
currently on an oral regimen and his pain appears to be
adequately controlled.

His left clavicle fracture was evaluated by Orthopedics and was
managed non operatively. he should not bear full weight on his
left arm. he will follow up as an outpatient.

He was evaluated by Physical therapy and is being recommended
for rehab after his acute hospital stay.
