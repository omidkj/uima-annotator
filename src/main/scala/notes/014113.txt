Pertinent Results:
[**10-2**] Echo: PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is normal in size. No
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the
body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No spontaneous
echo contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No thrombus
is seen in the left atrial appendage. 2. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 3. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). 4. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The right ventricular free wall
is hypertrophied. 5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
root. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 6.
There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. 7. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
POST-CPB: Ventricular systolic function is preserved. The aortic
contour is intact post-decannulation. Trivial mitral
regurgitation remains as per prebypass exam.
[**10-3**] CXR: Since last exam [**2142-10-2**] (one day ago), all
tubes and catheters have been removed. There are bilateral
pleural effusions and associated basal atelectasis. No PTX
identified on this semi-erect film. The heart is upper normal in
size without vascular congestion. It is difficult to compare
this exam with study one day ago with bibasilar atelectasis,
having developed.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Ms. [**Known lastname 1182**] was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
surgical care. Upon admission pre-operative work-up was done. On
[**10-2**] she was brought to the operating room and underwent a
coronary artery bypass graft x 3. Please see operative note for
details. Following surgery she was transferred to the CVICU for
invasive monitoring in stable condition. Within 24 hours she was
weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated.
On post-op day one she was started on beta blockers and
diuretics and gently diuresed towards her pre-op weight. Also on
this day her chest tubes were removed and she had some episodes
of atrial fibrillation. AFib was properly treated and she
ultimately was started on Amiodarone. On post-op day two she was
transferred to the SDU for further care. On post-op day three he
epicardial pacing wires were removed. She continued to recover
slowly while working with physical therapy for strength and
mobility. She recieved an extra dose of IV Lasix for some
dyspnea (CXR revealed bibasilar atelectasis w/small bilat.
effusions, both of which have improved on follow-up x-ray today)
On post-op day #5 she appeared to be doing well and was
discharged to rehab facility.
