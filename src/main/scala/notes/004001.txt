Attending:[**Last Name (un) 7835**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever and altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with placement of biliary stent

History of Present Illness:
78 year old man with h/o Afib on Coumadin, CHF, with recent
admission to [**Hospital1 18**] need/[**Location (un) **] for ascending cholangitis (d/c
[**4-23**]) had ERCP with stent replacement, who presents today from
rehab with elevated white blood count (26 at rehab) and shaking.


Patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from 5/55/12-6/1/12 for
ascending cholangitis and UTI after presenting with AMS, fevers
with abdominal US demonstrating obstruction. He underwent ERCP
which demonstrated gross pus.  A previously placed mental stent
was removed. A previously placed plastic stent had migrated into
the right hepatic duct/bilary tree - removal was not attempted
given concurrent cholangitis. He further underwent placement of
a 5cm by 10FR double pig tail biliary stent was placed
successfully for decompression with the proximal end terminating
in the left hepatic duct with good biliary flow.  He was
initially treated with zosyn which was subsequently narrowed to
Augmentin for a planned 14 day course (last day [**2128-4-29**]).  As
above the patient has a previous history of obstruction with
placement of 2 stents. Plan was originally for removal in summer
of [**2126**] however he was lost to follow-up.

The day of presentation patient was noted to have shaking chills
at rehab, labs were done and demonstrated a white count of 26.
He presented [**Hospital1 **] Needeham from rehab where labs were notable for
elevated WBC,lipase of 42 and bili of 9. CXR demonstrated
pulmonary edema but no PNA. Head CT was negative for an acute
process. He was given IVF, zosyn/ vanc and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further management.

In the ED, initial VS were: 96.5 86 86/49  92% ra. He was given
2 L of NS with improvement in BP to the 130s.  Labs were notable
once again for bili 7.5, ALT/AST in the 100s, alk phos of 949,
WBC 22, CR of 1.4 and Na of 148. RUQ US showed intrahepatic
biliary dilation, penumobilia, bilary sludge, and stable
pancreatic duct dilitation. He was given 10 mg IV vitamin K for
an INR of 3.2.  The ERCP fellow was contact[**Name (NI) **] with plan for ERCP
tomorrow. He was admitted to the ICU for further management.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were afebrile 89 141/74 99%
2L NC.He denies any complaint including chest pain, shortness of
breath, abdominal pain, headache, nausea, vomiting.

RUQ ULTRASOUND ([**2128-4-28**]):
1. Intrahepatic biliary dilatation and pneumobilia.  Stent in
common bile duct with stable dilatation of pancreatic duct.
2. Distended gallbladder with sludge and thickened wall, most
likely due to third spacing.
3. Right pleural effusion and ascites.

ECHO ([**2128-4-29**]):
Suboptimal image quality. There is a small mobile mass which may
represents a small vegetation on the tricuspid valve. If
clinically indicated, a transesophageal echocardiographic
examination is recommended. Decreased biventricular systolic
function with abnormal septal wall motion. Mild aortic
regurgitation. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate
tricuspid regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Large left pleural effusion.

RUE ULTRASOUND ([**2128-4-30**]): Clot in the right basilic vein.  No DVT
in the right upper extremity.

BIOPSY ([**2128-4-28**]): Periampullary mass, mucosal biopsies:
Adenomatous mucosal fragments, predominantly with low grade
dysplasia; see note. Note: Occasional areas demonstrate nuclei
with disordered polarity and cytologic features worrisome for
high grade dysplasia. No definite carcinoma in these biopsy
samples.

BRUSHINGS ([**2128-4-28**]): POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS, consistent
with adenocarcinoma.

CXR [**2128-5-4**]:
Moderately-severe pulmonary edema is unchanged, but moderate
right and small left pleural effusion have both increased
substantially since [**4-28**].  Cardiac silhouette is partially
obscured, but probably still mildly enlarged.  Heavy
calcification of the cardiac silhouette along the diaphragmatic
surface is probably left ventricular aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm.



Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo male with recent cholangitis s/p ERCP with stent placement
who presents from rehab with chills, AMS, elevated WBC, elevated
bilirubin, LFTs and concern for recurrent cholangitis.

1. Severe sepsis with septic shock; secondary to:
2. VRE, pseudomonas, and enterobacter septicemia
3. Cholangitis
4. Possible endocarditis

Presented with fever, leukocytosis, confusion, and acute renal
failure. Imaging demonstrated biliary dilitation, pneumobilia,
biliary sludge and stable pancreatic duct dilitation. ERCP
demonstrated frank pus draining from behind an obstructed
proximal stent. The stent was removed, however a more distal
stent in the right hepatic duct was not removed. Initial
treatment for enterococcus was vancomycin, then switched to
daptomycin when noted to be VRE. Initial treatment for GNR was
pip-tazo.

Regarding possible bacterial endocarditis, an echo showed a
small mobile mass which may represents a small vegetation on the
tricuspid valve. While a TEE would provide a more definitive
diagnosis, this was deferred in favor of empiric treatment with
6 weeks of antibiotics.  Yet, due to goals of care, antibiotics
were stopped prior to discharge home on hospice.

5. Adenocarcinoma: CT abdomen showed enhancing lesion around
pacreatic head. ERCP showed a 4mm fungating mass at the major
papilla. Brushings were positive for adenocarcinoma. After
discussion with the family, oncology consultation was pursued
but pt's poor performance status as well as significant
comorbidities precludes surgery or aggressive therapy.

6. Acute renal failure: Initially elevated with improvement
after IVF then another increase later in course.

7. Encephalopathy: Family reports waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental
status over the past several weeks (especially in hospital
setting). Likely multifactorial.

8. Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Noted to have pulmonary edema
on CXR in the setting of IVF for hypotension. Lisinorpil was
held du
