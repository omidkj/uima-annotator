Chief Complaint:
Right Hip fracture status post mechanical fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Open reduction and internal fixation of right hip
intertrochanteric fracture
Intubation
Trach and PEG placement
PICC placement
EGD and colonoscopy

History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 85yo man who presented to the ED 1 day status post
fall, pt relates fall in kitchen while he was attempting to turn
around. States he tripped over his own legs, never lost
consciousness, and denies associated symptoms before or after
the event. Pt fell on his right hip, had immediate pain, layed
on the floor for a short while, then was able to ambulate with a
walker. This morning pain was mush worse so he presented to the
ED where he was found to have a Right Hip fracture. Initially
the patient was to be admitted to Orthopaedics, but was then
found to have hyponatremia and was admitted to medicine. The pt
has no complaints except for hip pain currently.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2195-2-13**]
IMPRESSION:
No focal consolidations or CHF and no significant change from
[**2195-2-10**].

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2195-2-10**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No pneumonia or pneumothorax.
2. Fracture deformities of the right posterior 7th and 8th ribs,
clinical correlation is recommended to determine if there is an
acute component.
3. Bilateral pleural plaques reflecting asbestos exposure.

CT PELVIS ORTHO W/O C  [**2195-2-10**]
CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a complex fracture
line extending through the intertrochanteric region of the right
femur. The fracture extends to both the anterior and posterior
cortical surfaces. Two main fragments are present. There is
slight external rotation of the distal fragment with respect to
the proximal fragment. No other pelvic fractures are identified.
There is moderately severe concentric joint space narrowing in
the left hip joint space with extensive osteophyte formation
with subchondral cystic change. No fracture plane is visualized.
There is mild joint space narrowing in the right hip with
osteophyte formation, much less than on the left.

There are colonic diverticula without evidence of acute
diverticulitis. The appendix is normal. The bladder wall does
not appear thickened. The prostate gland is mildly enlarged with
several punctate areas of calcification. There is no free fluid
in the pelvis.

IMPRESSION:
1. Nondisplaced complex fracture through right femoral
intertrochanteric region.

2. Moderate, non-specific, arthropathy of the left hip.

CT pelvis/abdomen [**2-24**]:
COMPARISONS: No prior CTs are available on PACs for comparison
purposes.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images from the lung bases to the
pubic symphysis were acquired with intravenous and oral contrast
material and displayed with 5-mm slice thickness. Coronal and
sagittal reformations were performed.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are calcified
pleural plaques at the lung bases consistent with prior asbestos
exposure. There also are bilateral pleural effusions and basal
atelectasis. An NG tube is seen with the tip in the antrum. The
liver contains multiple hypoattenuating lesions, the largest one
measuring 2.6 cm in segment VI. These lesions are consistent
with metastases in the context of known prostate cancer.
Gallbladder is collapsed. The spleen and adrenal glands appear
unremarkable. The kidneys are notable for cortical atrophy and
the right kidney contains a hypoattenuating lesion seen on
series 2, image 41, which may represent a cyst but a metastatic
focus cannot be excluded. The pancreas appears unremarkable and
is mostly fatty replaced. In the region of the cecum and
ascending colon, note is made of an irregular-appearing bowel
wall, and there is the suspicion of pneumatosis in this region.
This may be due to infectious colitis, typhlitis or ischemia.
Alternatively, the appearance may be caused by fecal material.
In the clinical context of bacteremia and guarding, however the
concern for pathologic process in the region of the cecum and
ascending colon persists. There also is a small amount of fluid
tracking down the right paracolic gutter and there is a small
amount of fluid surrounding the kidneys and tracking down into
the pelvis. As far as this can be evaluated on this study, the
aortic tributaries appear patent. No mesenteric or
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is seen, however there are
multiple small retroperitoneal lymph nodes that do not meet size
criteria for pathologic enlargement.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Normal-appearing
contrast-filled appendix was visualized. Sigmoid c
