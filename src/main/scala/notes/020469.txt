Brief Hospital Course:
On [**8-6**], overnight following admission, the pt developed
bradycardia, hypotension and decreased mental status. Code blue
was called, EKG showed bradycardia with hr 31. Pt responded to
transcutaneous pacing and dopamine. Pt's SBP returned to 160 and
HR came up.  ABG was 7.17/43/220/17, novolyte potassium was 6.4.
Was given bicarb for acidemia and transferred to CCU. In CCU was
given calcium gluconate, insulin, D50 bolus, D5W with 150 meq
bicarb drip at 100cc/hr and kayexalate. Renal was consulted.
Albuterol was also added to lower K. Potassium improved to 5.7
then 5.0.  Repeat ABG done 7.23/44/104/19. Ck was found to be 88
and troponin slightly elevated at 0.34.

In the CCU, once he was stabilized, it was determined that he
would have a pacemaker placed. Because of his portacath, used
for frequent blood draws and lasix infusions, surgery was
consulted for removal, however given that it was not infected,
EP placed pacemaker on right side of chest, uneventfully.

For his renal issues, his CRI likely due to diabetic
nephropathy. Pt's baseline cr recently has been 3.2-4.3. He
episode of hyperkalemia secondary to renal insufficiency and
diuresis. His primary nephrologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1366**] did not feel that
hemodialysis was indicated. MRA of renal arteries was normal. He
has eosinophilia and muddy brown casts, suggestive of mild ATN.
 He is also undergoing an outpatient transplant eval.   We
followed his potassium and fluid balance carefully, and titrated
his lasix to 120mg po qd with Zaroxolyn to augment his diuresis.

For his [**Hospital Ward Name 4675**] cyst, he had been suffering from knee pain for
some time and the presence of [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4675**] cyst was diagnosed a
month earlier.  Vanco started because of the accompanying
erythema and rheumatology consulted.  An arthrocentesis was
performed with steroid injection which revealed non-infectious
fluid.  Subsequent cultures were sterile. An MRI performed
showeed a meniscal tear.  Orthopedics recommended conservative
therapy with ice/pain control for [**Hospital Ward Name **] cyst.  NSAIDS were
contraindicated given his renal insufficiencey.

For his Type I diabetes mellitus, we continued sliding-scale
insulin and fingerstick checks four times, daily.

For his anemia, we felt this was secondary to his chronic renal
insufficiency, a result of decreased erythropoesis.  His epogen
was continued, per renal recs.

For F/E/N, we continued diabetic, low sodium diet

For Prophylaxis, he was kept on a PPI,  and per request from
renal, we held his heparin given that they found reports that it
could worsen hyperkalemia.

For access, we accessed his portacath, as well as peripheral
IVs.

His code status was full.
