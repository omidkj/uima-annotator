History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 70 year old woman with a history of severe COPD

tracheomalacia, s/p bavonna trach w/ Y-stent, type II DM and CHF
who is admitted to the MICU for mechanical ventilation. Her
problems began in [**2130**] in the setting of hospitalization and
then rehabilitation for CHF. She was transferred from [**State 108**] to
[**Hospital3 105**] and intubated x3wks for respiratory distress.
She was then xfered to [**Hospital1 336**] for trach/PEG. The trach was changed
to a bavonna [**1-/2132**] and then returned to [**Hospital1 **]. She did well
until [**Month (only) **] when she had increased work of breathing. The
tracheostomy tube was then changed at [**Hospital3 5365**] and at
[**Hospital1 18**] a bronch was performed and it was noted she had an
peri-tracheal ulceration with naer-total obstruction of her
trach. In late [**First Name7 (NamePattern1) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7935**] was placed and the trach was
placed into the stent. Her course was also complicated by
serratia sepsis / pseudomonas & acinetobacter pneumonia, NSTEMI,
fluid overload, and refractory hypotention. She was discharged
to rehab [**2132-6-25**]. At rehab she did well, her diet was advanced
but had great difficulty weaning from the vent.

Brief Hospital Course:
70 year old woman with respiratory failure, tracheomalacia, CHF,
COPD on home o2, and type II diabetes presenting from rehab for
rigid bronchoscopy.
# Tracheomalacia: s/p y-stent and bavonna trach 6/[**2131**]. The
physicians at NE-[**Hospital1 **] have had difficulty weaning her from the
vent. She is here for evaluation of whether her airways are
patent and for other causes for her continued respiratory
failure. The differential diagnosis is continued fluid overload,
pneumonitis or pneumonia.
- CXR  showed bilateral lung opacities, possibly slightly more
aerated than in the prior study from [**2132-6-24**]
- flex bronch in AM  - found to have subglottic and supraglottic
edema , subglottic stenosis, and bronchitis.  IP recs to
increase PPI to [**Hospital1 **], start guaifenisin 600mg po bid, increase
flovent to 220mcg 2 puffs [**Hospital1 **].  Please return to IP if problems
with decannulation.
.
# Cardiac: h/o CHF, systolic dysfunction. She is significantly
fluid overloaded on exam, but by family report is much improved.
