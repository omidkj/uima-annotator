Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 371**]
Chief Complaint:
abdominal pain, constipation, chills

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2169-2-14**] Exploratory laparotomy, subtotal colectomy, [**Doctor Last Name 3379**]
pouch and ileostomy

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] 89y/o lady with HTN, dCHF, and multiple admissions for
diverticulitis (most recently in [**2168-11-24**]) who presented to
the ED with abdominal pain and chills.
.
Patient states that for 1-2 weeks, she has had LLQ and lower
abdominal pain. Has been increasingly constipated for ~1 week.
She has had chills but no documented fever. Spitting up brownish
phlegm, but no cough or other URI symptoms. Poor PO intake at
home, mild nausea. Had a loose bowel movement on the day of
presentation but no blood. She and her family felt this was
similar to prior episodes of diverticulitis so she came to the
ED.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS: pain [**5-4**], T 100.0, HR 86, BP
137/91, RR 16. Labs notable for WBC 9.8 (75% PMNs), Cr 1.3
(baseline is 1), K 2.9, Ca [**66**].7. She received 40mEq of
potassium. CXR with no signs of PNA but did show air/fluid
levels in the gut. CT abdomen/pelvis showed sigmoid
diverticulitis with dilated fluid filled colon increased in
caliber since prior exam, suggestive of evolving colonic
obstruction. ACS was consulted and felt there was no surgical
intervention needed at this time; obstruction felt to be likely
due to stool, recommended manual disimpaction and they will
follow along. She received Morphine for pain control, Zofran for
nausea, and Ciprofloxacin/ Metronidazole. Received 1L NS in the
ED. She is admitted to Medicine for management for
diverticulitis with colonic obstruction. VS prior to transfer
were T98.3, HR 69, RR 16, BP 158/97, POx 95%RA.
.
Upon arrival to the Medicine floor, she feels fins but still has
crampy abdominal pain, now mostly in her lower abdomen. Nothing
else is bothering her except that she is tired from being in the
ED. She is not passing any gas and feels very constipated. Last
BM was a loose stool on the day of presentation prior to coming
in to the ED.
.

CXR:
FINDINGS: The heart size is at the upper limits of normal,
similar to prior exam. The mediastinal and hilar contours are
within normal limits. The lungs show no lobar consolidation.
Again a hiatal hernia is present. There is no pleural effusion
or pneumothorax. There is no subdiaphragmatic free air.
Air-fluid levels noted below the diaphragm may indicate
obstruction or delayed gastrointestinal transit.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia; question of intestinal
obstruction or slowed intestinal transit. CT pending.

CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2169-2-11**] 10:52 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Findings suggestive of evolving colonic obstruction with low
transition
point in the distal sigmoid colon in the region of known
diverticulitis, with apparent inflammatory tethering. Underlying
mass must be excluded once inflammation resolves. No free air.
2. Trace perihepatic ascites.
3. Gallbladder sludge or stone.
4. Hiatal hernia.
5. Right renal cyst.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT) Study Date of [**2169-2-13**] 12:06 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Markedly dilated ascending and transverse colon measuring up
to 8 cm in
diameter with accompanied air-fluid levels on the lateral
decubitus study.  These findings are consistent with a colonic
obstruction. No free air.  Careful imaging followup is advised
and clinical assessment is also suggested.




Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] 89y/o lady with HTN, dCHF, and multiple admissions for
diverticulitis (most recently in [**2168-11-24**]) who presents
with sigmoid diverticulitis and possible evolving colonic
obstruction.
.
#. Evolving colonic obstruction:exam becoming concerning for
evolving colonic obstruction. Surgery on board and following
closely. Per surgery request colonic gastrograph is being
performed today and possible operation later in day.WBC
increased to 10.9 from 7.
- NPO for now
- IVF PRN if not tolerating adequate PO intake
- antibiotics:cipro/flagyl day 1 was [**2-12**]
- pain control w/ acetaminophen, oxycodone, tramadol
- appreciate Surgery recs
- serial abdom exams w/ possible surgery later in the day
.
# [**Name (NI) 97480**] pt most likely also has a recurrent infection
in the area of evolving colonic obstruction. She has been
afebrile, but increasing WBC. Unclear whether infection vs
obstruction acutely causing increase.
- cont cipro/flagyl D1 [**2-12**]
- monitor for signs of fever
- serial abdom exams
.
#. Hypertension: stable
- holding HCTZ for hypokalemia
- holding Enalapril for [**Last Name (un) **]
- continue Metoprolol
.
#. Chronic Diastolic heart failure: stable.
She is not clinically volume overloaded.
- continue BB
- holding ACE-i for resolving [**Last Name (un) **] and possible surgery
- continue to hold Lasix, not volume overloaded pt not taking in
much po
- monitor daily weights, I/O monitoring
.
#. Hyperlipidemia: stable.
- continue statin
.
#. Anxiety: stable.
- continue Bupropion XL, Mirtazapine

#. [**Last Name (un) **]: likely prerenal.
Cr was 1.3 on admission (baseline is 1.0). She reports poor PO
intake at home and thisa appears most likely prerenal. Also,
unclear if she has been using NSAIDs (Salsalate) which is on
prior med list.
- IVF as above
- trend Cr, renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
- consider spinning urine, although improved creatinine with
hydration
.
#. Hypokalemia: likely multifactorial.
She reports "spitting up" which could represent emesis and GI
losses, though this seems to be phlegm rather than vomit.
Otherwise, her hypokalemia can also be explained by di
