History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 83 y.o. male who is s/p gastro-jejunostomy more than 20
years ago who presented with abdominal pain and ascites and had
a
CT of his abdomen that is concerning for a mass in the common
bile duct extending to the head of the pancreas.  He initially
saw his PCP back in early [**Month (only) 404**] who noted that his LFTs were
elevatd and sent him to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP.  On ERCP it was
difficult
to visualize the papilla and the patient was referred for the
above CT scan. This mass seen on CT scan  is thought to be a
cholangiocarcinoma.

CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  [**2113-2-14**] 12:09 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Prominent intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. A soft
tissue density mass is seen within the common bile duct
extending to the head of the pancreas is concerning for tumor.
Prominent gallbladder wall thickening may be related to
patient's underlying ascites, as the gallbladder is not tensely
distended.

2. Significant peripancreatic stranding and decreased
enhancement of the pancreatic body are concerning for
pancreatitis in the right clinical setting.
Ill defined soft tissue around the celiac axis raises the
possibility of an infiltrating tumor

3. Large intra-abdominal ascites.

4. Status post repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm without
evidence of leak.

5. Left lower quadrant spigelian hernia containing normal
appearing sigmoid colon and fluid.

6. Prostatic enlargement.
.
MULTI-PROCEDURE SAME DAY  [**2113-2-15**] 7:37 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Percutaneous cholangiogram demonstrates a markedly dilated
intrahepatic ducts as well as distal CBD and presence of stones
within the common bile duct.
2. Successful placement of an external modified 8-French
nephrostomy tube via a right biliary with pigtail coiled with it
and CBD.
3. Paracentesis was performed with drainage of 300 cc of
serosanguineous ascitic fluid. That was sent for cytology.
4. We will reattempt procedure within two days to pass the
obstruction site and internalize the biliary tube.
.
Cytology Report PERITONEAL FLUID Procedure Date of [**2113-2-15**]
DIAGNOSIS: Ascites from paracentesis:

  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS
.
BILIARY STENT  [**2113-2-17**] 9:03 AM
[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
83 year old man with likely cholangiocarcinoma with obstructive
disease
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Internalize stent
INDICATION FOR EXAM: This is an 83-year-old man with CBD
obstruction status post right PTBD with external biliary
drainage placed, needs procedure to pass the level of the
obstruction. Also needs internalization of the stent.
IMPRESSION:
1. Pullback cholangiogram demonstrates distal CBD obstruction
and duodenal obstruction at the level of the ligament of Treitz.
2. Successful placement of 2 stents within the ligament of
Treitz and the CBD.
3. Successful placement of an 8-French modified external drain
with pigtail coiled within the ligament of Treitz and the CBD.
.
BILIARY CATH CHECK  [**2113-2-20**] 7:22 AM
CHOLANGIOGRAM AND STONE REMOVAL AND TUBE CHANGE

INDICATION: 83-year-old man with biliary obstruction, status
post biliary and duodenal stenting, now with increasing LFT.

IMPRESSION:
1. Status post biliary and duodenal stenting.
2. Multiple stones in the common duct.
3. Percutaneous stone removal with improved appearance of the
common duct on the followup cholangiogram.
4. Replacement of the internal-external drainage catheter.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted 0n [**2113-2-13**] with epigastric pain and elevated
LFT's. He likely had metastatic cholangiocarcinoma based on the
CT and due to the large amount of ascites and PTC drain was
thought to be a better option.

On [**2113-2-15**] he went for a PTC and had successful placement of an
external modified 8-French nephrostomy tube via a right biliary
with pigtail coiled with it and CBD, and Paracentesis was
performed with drainage of 300 cc of serosanguineous ascitic
fluid.

On [**2113-2-17**], he went back to IR for internalization of the drain.

While in the PACU on [**2-15**], after the first procedure, he had
post-procedure hypovolemia, hypotension and tachycardia. He
required IV fluid and Albumin and he responded appropriately
within a couple hours.

He was tolerating a regular diet.

On [**2-20**], he went to IR again for status post biliary and
duodenal stenting,  Multiple stones in the common duct,
Percutaneous stone removal with improved appearance of the
common duct on the follow up cholangiogram, Replacement of the
internal-external drainage catheter. The Bile grew out
Vancomycin sensitive ENTEROCOCCUS. He was placed on Vanc/Zosyn.

Palliative Care: He was seen by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2270**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1764**] and she discussed
with him and the family some options for home.

Respiratory Distress: On [**2-21**], he was noted to be tachypneic
with a RR to 40, and an O2 sat in the 80's%. An ABG showed 68*
31* 7.48* 24. He also complained to right sided flank pain and
right shoulder pain. He was placed on a non-rebreather and his
O2 sats rose to the 90's%. He received Morphine for pain
control. He was stabilized. Later that evening, he was
transferred to the ICU for a repeat episode of low O2 sats. His
WBC rose to 25.2. A CT was done on [**2-22**] and showed increased
IP: HD 10, he went to IP for a thoracentesis. 1.8 liter of fluid
was pulled off and was + for bile. This was + for [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
/ [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] - RARE GROWTH, and he was started on
Fluconzole

VATS: He went to the OR on [**2-23**] for a washout and new drain
placement.
[**2113-2-23**] Cholangiogram -
1. Successful placement of a third stent extending towards the
confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts.
2. Good flow inside of the stent into the duodenum.
3. Successful removal of the internal and external drain.
4. Successful placement of 8 French drain placed into the
perihepatic space for drainage.
He remained in the ICU for several days while he recovered from
the procedure.

He was transferred back to the floor and was stable, but
continued to have an elevated WBC, elevated transaminase and a
Tbili in the 6-8 range. His biliary drain was flushed to keep
patent and the PICC line was pulled.

On [**2113-3-1**], IP placed a pig-tail drain in the right pleural space
and withdrew 500cc of yellowish fluid. Cultures revealed no
growth.

A CT on [**2113-3-1**] revealed:
1. Improved appearance of right pleural effusion, with residual
left pleural effusion. Peribronchial thickening in both lower
lobes may represent atelectasis vs infection.
2. Similar appearance of intra-abdominal ascites. A small amount
of air adjacent to perihepatic drain may be related to frequ
