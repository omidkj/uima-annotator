ADDENDUM: The patient's right foot was imaged with plane
films. No fractures, dislocations or destructive bone lesions
were identified. Magnetic resonance angiography of the right
foot was performed. Preliminary results showed a subcortical
process in the left second, third, fourth and fifth
metatarsals. Bone edema was noted in the absence of any lytic
lesions. These findings were not consistent with
osteomyelitis because, 1) lesions crossed the joint spaces,
2) there was an absence of lytic lesions and 3) the patient
has clinically improved over seven days in the absence of
antibiotics. This is a preliminary report and final [**Location (un) 1131**]
