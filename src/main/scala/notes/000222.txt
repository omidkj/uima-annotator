Rigid bronchoscopy, flexible bronchoscopy, tumor
destruction, and tumor ablation with APC.


History of Present Illness:
62M with NSCCa in R bronchus with recent massive
hemoptysis.  Patient also has C. diff colitis.  He was admited

CT trachea [**2101-4-11**]
IMPRESSION:

1. Soft tissue thickening and nodularity of anterior wall
proximal right main bronchus with nonobstructive luminal
narrowing. In a patient with history of lung cancer, this is
concerning for endobronchial neoplasm involvement. However, if
the patient has had prior stent placement or other intervention,
granulation tissue is an additional consideration.

2. Abrupt cut off of the proximal right lower lobe bronchus,
possibly due to previous surgery for right lower lobe resection
for lung cancer. Correlation with operative history is
recommended to differentiate truly obstructed bronchus from
postoperative change.

3. Extensive abdominal ascites and mild anasarca.

4. Emphysema.

KUB [**4-12**]
IMPRESSION: Mildly dilated air-filled loops of large bowel,
consistent with colonic ileus. No evidence of obstruction.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred from [**State 1727**] and on HD#2, underwent right
mainstem bronchus stenting as a way to treat his malignant
obstruction and hemoptysis.  The patient was hypotensive through
the procedure requiring pressors and and also had transient
episodes of hypoxemia. The patient was aggressively fluid
resuscitated, and a stat trans-esophageal echocardiogram was
performed showing severe pulmonary hypertension (PASP estimated
at 101mmHg), severe hypokinesis of the RV / septum, no evidence
of shunt, and a relatively normal LV. The patient was
transferred to the intensive care unit intubated and requiring
pressors. Of note, the patient was weaned from the vasopressor
agents 1 hour after arriving to the intensive care unit and was
extubated
immediately afterwards.

On HD#3, he persisted in being hypotensive. His breathing was
labored, and his abdomen was found to be more significantly
distended that before. A general surgery consult was obtained to
evaluate his abdomen. He was found to have C. difficile colitis
without signs of toxic megacolon, and was treated with IV
metronidazole and PO vancomycin.

Originally, the intention of the family and the team of people
taking care of him here at [**Hospital1 18**] was to stabilize him to the
point that he may be transferred back home to be with his family
for what was sure to be his final [**Known lastname **]. During extensive
conversations with both the family and the patient, it was again
reiterated that he wanted no surgery or no extraordinary
measures to save his life. As the night wore on, the patient was
in increasing amounts of pain, but pain medication precipitously
dropped his blood pressure. More conversations were had with the
patient and his family, after which the decision was made to
provide the patient with comfort measures only, this being the
only way to relieve his suffering with pain medication while
respecting wishes to avoid aggressive measures to save his life.
He passed away about 2 hours after being made CMO. Offer of an
autopsy was declined by the family.
