Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
Ventricular Tachycardia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EP study

History of Present Illness:
This patient is a 67 y/o with a history of nonischemic
cardiomyopathy s/p ICD for primary prevention (VT in past,
[**1-11**], VF- shocked appropriately). He has been on amiodarone
since since end of [**2187**], and developed thyroid dysfunction. He
wishes to come off the arrythmia and presented to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
[**12-13**] for EP study for the possibilty of ablation to terminate
the VT. He discontinued amiodarone 1 month ago.

The patient had EP study for VT/VF ablation, and was shocked
externally for VF. He LV and RV were mapped and there ws no scar
seen, normal voltage. Given that there was no scar to ablate and
he had VF in the lab, the plan is for dofetilide load. Of note,
he had an 8 french arterial sheeth and 3 venous sheeths on the
right.

On admission to the CCU, patient was complaining of pain in his
mid back. he denied chest pain, lightheadedness, palpatations,
shortness of nreath

On review of systems:
- he denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools.
- He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies
exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of
systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.


Past Medical History:
Nonischemic cardiomyopathy, LVEF 35%

Brief Hospital Course:
Ventricular Tachycardia/Fibrillation: Pt has h/o VT previously
on amiodarone which was discontinued secondary to thyroid
dysfunction. He had EP study where he had 1 episode of induced
VF requiring DCCV with no scar to ablate. He had normal LV
voltage map. He was loaded with dofetilide. He had mild QT
prolongation on dofetilide 500 mcg [**Hospital1 **] (QTc ~480) so dose was
reduced to 125 mcg [**Hospital1 **]. He received 6 doses in house and was
monitored on telemetry without event. He will have an event
monitor at discharge for 2 weeks and have his creatinine checked
every 3 months while on dofetilide. He should avoid taking
hydrochlorothiazide or verapamil while on dofetilide.

Urinary retention: Likely due to longstanding BPH. Patient
initially taking tamsulosin in house, although switched to his
home alfuzosin. Foley was d/c'd and he had residual bladder
volume of 750ml. His outpatient urologist was called; foley was
replaced and he'll follow up with urology the day following
discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
You had an ablation that was unsuccessful in finding an
inducable ventricular tachycardia. You had a ventricular
fibrillation arrythmia that required an external shock. You were
admitted for a dofetilide load (Tikosyn) and had frequent ECG's
to monitor your QT interval. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] would like you to
have an event monitor at discharge for 2 weeks. You need to have
your creatinine checked every 3 months while you are taking
Tikosyn. Do not take any hydrochlorothiazide or Verapamil when
you are on Tikosyn. This was given to you in the hospital and
instructions regarding use were reveiwed with you.
Medication changes:
1. Dofetalide 125mg twice daily: to prevent ventricular
tachycardia instead of the amiodarone.
2. Lisinopril: to decrease the pressure that your heart pumps
against and help your heart pump better.

You had trouble urinating after we took out the foley catheter.
We talked to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 80249**] who asked that we replace the foley
and you will
