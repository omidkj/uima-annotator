Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
Right arm weakness, slurred speech

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Patient is an 84 year old female nursing home resident with PMH
of DVT [**3-4**], HTN, GERD, dermatitis.  She awoke this morning at
0540 with right arm weakness, slurred and inappropriate speech
and bladder/bowel incontinence.  She was noted to have said "I
think I'm having a stroke".  There was no associated fall or
trauma.  Was reportedly aphasic and weak in the right upper
extremity initially, but these deficits resolved at some point
as noted in the OSH records.  En route, she reportedly
desaturated to 88%, was put on face mask and improved, but
required CPR for some reason.  It is not known at this time if
she was receiving CPR for cardiac arrest or respiratory arrest.
.
CT at OSH showed Intracranial hemorhhage.  INR was found to be
6.4 (takes coumadin for h/o DVT this year).  She was given FFP
and transferred.
.
She was electively intubated at the OSH ([**Hospital3 628**]) and
arrived here to [**Hospital1 18**] intubated but not sedated.  On initial
evaluation by neurology ER resident, she was noted to be
unresponsive, moving all four extremities spontaneously (L>R),
with brain-stem reflexes intact and withdrawing X4 to pain.
Repeat INR here at [**Hospital1 18**] at 0830 showed INR of 3.2.  Patient was
given 2 vials of proplex.  3rd INR is pending at this time.
.

Past Medical History:
DVT [**3-4**], HTN, GERD, Bipolar, Dementia, chronic bladder issues,
OA, b/l knee pain with partial knee replacement in past.
Dermatitis. Undocumented, but according to son, has history of
"golf-ball sized" meningioma in the left part of brain.  Was
seen by a neurosurgeon last year who did not want to operate.
History from chart and partially from son who is unclear on some
details of PMH.


Social History:
NH resident.  Son lives nearby.  Otherwise unknown.

Unknown

Admission CT Head:
CT OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  A large left
frontoparietal
intraparenchymal hemorrhage is again noted.  There is
questionable minimal
increase in prominence of the caudal portion of the hemorrhage
in comparison with the examination of several hours earlier.
The degree of hypodensity surrounding the inferior portion of
the hemorrhage also appears minimally increased, consistent with
slight increase in edema.  The degree of left to right
subfalcine herniation is unchanged.  There is no hydrocephalus
or evidence of transtentorial herniation.  Bilateral cerebral
periventricular white matter hypodensity is consistent with
chronic small vessel ischemic change. There is no evidence of
extra-axial hemorrhage.
.
Bone windows demonstrate no evidence of fracture within the
surrounding
osseous structures.  The mastoid air cells and visualized
portions of the
paranasal sinuses are normally pneumatized.
.
IMPRESSION:  Left frontoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage,
questionably
minimally increased along its caudal aspect, without change in
degree of mass effect.
.
CT C Spine:
1.  No fracture or malalignment seen.
2.  Extensive degenerative disc disease as well as multilevel
DJD.
.
[**7-1**] follow up CT: Stable left frontoparietal intraparenchymal
hemorrhage.  No change in degree of mass effect
.
EEG [**6-30**]:
ABNORMALITY #1: Throughout the recording there were frequent
bursts of
mixed frequency slowing with a generalized distribution. There
were
also occasional bursts of bitemporal mixed frequency slowing.
ABNORMALITY #2: Background rhythm was usually disorganized. It
was
often somewhat slow, in the [**6-5**] Hz range although there were
some faster
frequencies. The background did react to external stimuli with
some
apparent alerting.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Could not be performed.
SLEEP: No normal waking or sleeping morphologies were seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm.
IMPRESSION: Abnormal portable EEG due to the bursts of
generalized
slowing with additional bitemporal mixed frequency slowing.
These
findings suggest multifocal subcortical abnormalities. Vascular
disease
is a relatively common cause of such findings. In addition, the
background was disorganized and usually somewhat slow,
suggesting a
concomitant encephalopathy. There were no areas of prominent and

persistent focal slowing, and there were no clear epileptiform
features.
.
Bilateral LENIs:
1.  No evidence of acute DVT.
2.  Evidence of prior DVT of the left popliteal vein.
.
MRI/MRA Brain:
FINDINGS:  As noted on the prior CT, there is an acute 4 cm left

frontoparietal intraparenchymal hematoma.  There is a small
amount of subdural blood present over the anterior left temporal
lobe.  There is mass effect upon the atrium of the ipsilateral
lateral ventricle.  However, there is no significant midline
shift or herniation.  There are no additional foci of abnormal
magnetic susceptibility to indicate other microhemorrhages.
There are multiple T2 hyperintensities within the subcortical
white matter of both cerebral hemispheres due to chronic
microvascula
