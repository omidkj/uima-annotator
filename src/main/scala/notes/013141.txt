Imaging:

[**2185-2-1**]: Abdominal U/S: 1. Edematous thickened gallbladder wall,
which can be seen in hepatitis and edematous states, such as
heart failure and hypoproteinemia.2. Hyperechoic hepatic
echotexture, consistent with fatty infiltration.3. Right pleural
effusion. Also, trace ascites and left perinephric fluid
.
[**2-1**]: CT chest: 1. Extensive consolidation of left lower lobe
and partial consolidation of left upper lobe, with minimal left
pleural effusion.

2. Right lung tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities and small right pleural
effusion. This represents pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonia.

3. Filling defects vs motion artifact in right pulmon
