CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fulminant hepatic failure.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year old
female of Indian origin with no known prior history of liver
disease and a past medical history significant for rheumatoid
arthritis and hypercholesterolemia who had been on Arava and
Lipitor who was transferred from [**Hospital 59596**] to [**Hospital1 1444**] for acute hepatic failure.

The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and has
been on Arava on 10 mg once daily with an increasing dose of
20 mg once daily since [**2191-6-16**].  The patient was also on
Lipitor 20 mg by mouth once daily which was also increased to
40 mg by mouth once daily at the time of [**Month (only) **] of [**2191-6-16**].  The patient traveled to [**Country 11150**] during the Summer and
while there developed some fatigue, anorexia, nausea, and
dark urine.  The patient was worked up as an outpatient in
the United States.  Subsequently, the patient developed a
fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, and
jaundice.  The patient was found to have elevated liver
function tests and was noted to have mild ascites on
ultrasound on [**2191-11-23**].

The patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 8544**] on [**2191-11-25**] and was found to have an elevated INR to 4 and an
elevated bilirubin.  She underwent a paracentesis at [**Hospital3 52139**] which demonstrated 4500 white cells per cc.  The
patient was started on third-generation cephalosporin for
concern of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.  The patient's
mental status worsened over the next 24 hours with elevations
in INR and bilirubin, and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 1444**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Rheumatoid arthritis,
hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and hypothyroidism.

HOME MEDICATIONS:  Arava 20 mg by mouth once daily and
Lipitor 50 mg by mouth once daily (both of which were stopped
on [**2191-11-4**]), Tylenol as needed for pain relief
(which was stopped on [**11-18**]), and Levoxyl.

ADDITIONAL MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Zofran, Protonix,
Demerol, Aldactone, Lasix, vitamin K, cholestyramine, and
Cefotetan.

ALLERGIES:  SULFA.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No alcohol use.  No tobacco use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No known history of liver disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  The temperature was 96.6,
the heart rate was 110 and regular, sinus tachycardia, the
blood pressure was 147/69, the respiratory rate was 19, and
100 percent on nonrebreather.  Obtunded.  On mental status,
responding only to painful stimuli.  Markedly jaundiced with
icteric sclerae.  The pupils were equally round and reactive
to light.  The neck was supple.  Cardiovascular examination
revealed a regular rhythm, sinus tachycardia.  No murmurs.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The
abdomen was mildly distended, soft, and nontender.  The right
flank with ecchymosis noted.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  On admission to [**Hospital1 1444**] the white count was 9.3, the
hematocrit was 34.4, and the platelets were 104.  Chemistries
revealed the sodium was 134, potassium was 3.7, chloride was
106, bicarbonate was 21, blood urea nitrogen was 13,
creatinine was 0.8, and glucose was 125.  AST was 541, ALT
was 469, alkaline phosphatase was 162, total bilirubin was
23.9, albumin was 2.4, and amylase was 174.  Coagulations
revealed PT was 34.8, PTT was 138.5, and INR was 7.6.

RADIOLOGY STUDIES:  A CT of the abdomen and pelvis done at
[**Hospital3 8544**] on [**2191-11-28**] with the report from
Study Hospital of small nodule in the liver, normal size
spleen, moderate ascites, bilateral pleural effusion, and
positive gallstones.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Surgical Intensive Care Unit late in the evening of [**2191-11-30**].  The patient was given 4 units of fresh frozen
plasma given her severe coagulopathy.  Because of continued
deteriorated mental status, the patient was intubated.

Early in the morning of [**2191-12-1**] the patient's
mental status changes were deemed to be due to hepatic
encephalopathy and received a head CT STAT after intubation
which was within normal limits without any masses or
bleeding.  The patient was found to be tachycardic, and
reexamination was found to have a systolic ejection murmur.
A cardiac echocardiogram was done which revealed a left-to-
right shunt consistent with an atrial septal defect or patent
foramen ovale.  The patient also had increased pulmonary
artery pressures.  The patient also underwent an ultrasound
of the abdomen which showed a very small nodule in the liver
and some ascites.  A CT of the abdomen also done at the same
time showed generalized anasarca with edematous small bowel,
again a small nodule in the liver about the size of a spleen.

The patient's liver function tests and bilirubin continued to
rise with the total bilirubin peaking at 31.7.  This was
fulminant hepatic failure.  The patient's renal system
continued to be poor.  The patient did not make much urine on
arrival, and her creatinine - while it was normal - did not
explain her cause of oliguria.  Because the patient was
oliguric, the patient became volume overloaded given the
medication that was necessary to sustain her life.
Eventually, the patient was started on continuous venovenous
hemofiltration.  Because the patient had severe coagulopathy,
the patient was put on a fresh frozen plasma drip and
received packed red blood cells as needed to keep her
hematocrit from falling.  The patient also received platelets
as needed to keep her platelets above 100.

The patient's respirations were difficult to maintain.  A
chest x-ray revealed possible right-sided consolidative
processes, and it there was concern that the patient might
have had an aspiration event.  The patient underwent a
bronchoscopy which did not show any pockets of thickened
sputum or purulence within the bronchial system.

The patient was maintained on ceftriaxone prophylaxis as well
as on Levaquin.  Despite all our best efforts, the patient
went into multisystem failure with pulmonary hypertension
with left-to-right shunting, respiratory failure with
possible aspiration pneumonia, fulminant liver failure, and
acute renal failure.  The multisystem failure became
overwhelming, and the patient's life could not be sustained
despite our best efforts.

The patient was comfort measures only [**2191-12-3**] - on
the fourth day of her Intensive Care Unit stay at the [**Hospital1 1444**] - after conferring with the
family who understood the patient's grave prognosis.  The
patient's supports were turned off.  The patient was placed
on a morphine drip, and the patient expired without
discomfort in the early morning of [**2191-12-4**].

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Expired.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Acute fulminant hepatic failure; likely due to medication
   toxicity from Arava and Lipitor.
2. Multisystem organ failure with cardiovascular failure,
   respiratory failure, hepatic failure, and renal failure.


DATE OF DEATH:  [**2191-12-4**].
