Pertinent Results:
CT abd and pelvis [**2159-9-30**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Increased gaseous distention of the bowel compared to the
previous study. The colon is predominantly distended with some
distention of small bowel. Findings are probably due to ileus.
2. Decreased extraperitoneal hemorrhage adjacent to the bladder.
There is
residual blood around the right pelvic sidewall and lateral to
the right psoas muscle. Generalized subcutaneous edema is seen
in the inferior pelvis. The scrotum was not imaged on the
current study. Findings of the study were discussed with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2159-9-29**] at 13:10 hours.
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2159-9-30**]  12:37:16 PM
Sinus rhythm. Right bundle-branch block. Compared to the
previous tracing
tachycardia has resolved and premature ventricular contractions
are no longer
seen.

Sinus tachycardia with premature ventricular contractions. Right
bundle-branch block. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2157-9-27**]
the rate has increased further.

CTA [**2159-9-28**] [**Location (un) **]:

IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism to the segmental level. Motion
artifacts limit the evaluation of subsegmental arteries.
2. Centrilobular emphysema
3. Suboptimal inspiration with significant collapse of bronchus
intermedius
and left lower lobe bronchus suggests bronchomalacia.
4. Dilation of the esophagus and small hiatal hernia.
5. Coronary artery calcifications. Scattered aortic
calcification.
.
CT Pelvix with contrast [**2159-9-26**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Comminuted, intra-articular fractures of the posterior and
anterior
columns of the acetabulum; the latter extends into the iliac
bone.
2. Simple, oblique fracture of the inferior pubic ramus.
3. Associated lower pelvic hematoma or contained bladder
rupture. Cystogram would be useful if clinically indicated.
4. No change in appearance of horseshoe kidney.
5. Bilateral fat-containing inguinal hernias.
.
CT cystogram without Contrast [**2159-9-26**]
IMPRESSION: No bladder wall rupture. Stranding and hematoma
overlying the
anterior and superior margin of the bladder. Right hip
comminuted fractures as described.
.
CXR [**2159-9-28**]:
There is blunting of the left CP angle, slightly more
conspicuous
than on the prior study. There is some volume loss in the
retrocardiac region. An early infiltrate could be present in
this area. The transverse colon is slightly dilated measuring up
to 8 cm. This is increased compared to the film from the prior
day.
.
[**9-25**]: 3 views right hip
IMPRESSION: Right lateral acetabular irregularity likely
corresponds to
an acute fracture. CT pelvis is recommended for confirmation and

characterization of fracture. Findings posted to the ED
dashboard at 11:30
p.m. on [**2159-9-25**].
.
[**9-26**]: pelvic xray
Right anterior column acetabular fracture. Please note that
there is very
limited evaluation due to portable technique and the other
fractures seen on the CT are not as well seen. Please refer to
previously performed CT report.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted after fall resulting in pelvic/hip
fracture. He was first admitted to orthopedics and had a ORIF of
the right acetablum with pinning on [**9-27**]. On [**9-28**], he was hypoxia
to and tachypnea with RR of 34. He was given lasix and had a CTA
that was negative for PE. He was maintained on a high flow mask
overnight and then wean
