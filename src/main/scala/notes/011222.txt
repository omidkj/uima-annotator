Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 2080**]
Chief Complaint:
Seizure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Thoracentesis ([**10-16**]) with Interventional Pulmonology.
EEG


History of Present Illness:
63 y/o M with PMHx of HTN, Hep C Cirrhosis c/b encephalopathy
and DM who was found by EMS after having a generalized
tonic/clonic seizure on a bus, lasting 1-2 minutes with urine
incontinence and FBS >500 (critically high). Pt was given 2mg
Narcan for pinpoint pupils with no significant effect. Pt was
transported to ED and stopped seizing spontaneously. He was
notably restless, confused but responsive on arrival to [**Hospital1 **]. He
may have had a similar episode in [**2187-6-8**].
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 99 P 70 BP 200/palp R 18 O2 99%
RA. Pt underwent CT head which was negative and CT C-spine
showed no evidence of fracture and some question of gas in
fascial layers. CXR showed a question of retrocardiac opacity.
Pt received Ceftriaxone 2grams, Vancomycin and Ativan 0.5mg IV
for question of meningitis in setting of MS changes and seizure.
However, MS cleared and LP was not performed due to low
suspician for meningitis. Serum osmolarity returned at 340 and
pt was given 4L NS IVF and 20units IV insulin.
.
On arrival to the ICU, pt was tired but responsive. He was not
wanting to speak but denied CP, SOB, nausea, abd pain, diarrhea,
cough, fevers, congestion or prior seizures. He did not remember
the events from the afternoon but was able to give me the phone
number for his family who provided additional past medical
information. In the unit the patients glucose was controlled, he
was kept on CIWA protocal but showed no signs of withdrawl. Pts
urine OSMS were also corrected. In the Unite the patient did not
have another seizure.
.
On arrival to the floor pt seems somewhat tired and withdrawn
but is easily able to interact and withdrawl. Pt notes no pain,
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, fevers.  Pt is resting
comfortably

Microbiology:
[**2187-10-16**] PLEURAL FLUID
   GRAM STAIN (Final [**2187-10-16**]):
      3+  (5-10 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR
LEUKOCYTES.
      NO MICROORGANISMS SEEN.
      This is a concentrated smear made by cytospin method,
please refer to
      hematology for a quantitative white blood cell count..

   FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):    NO GROWTH.

Blood Culture, Routine (Final [**2187-10-17**]):    NO GROWTH.

URINE CULTURE (Final [**2187-10-13**]):    NO GROWTH.

Studies:
CXR: ([**10-11**])Retrocardiac opacity suspicious for pneumonia.
Conversely this
may represent incomplete collapse of the left lower lobe. If
clinically
feasible, consider PA and lateral views for further evaluation.
There are
other signs of volume loss which support the contention of
atelectasis over
pneumonia; however, pneumonia cannot be excluded.

CXR:  ([**10-13**])Compared to the film from two days ago, there has
been marked
worsening appearance of the left lower lobe infiltrate. There is
a
moderate-sized left pleural effusion and a small right effusion,
both of whichhave increased compared to prior. There is
pulmonary vascular redistributionand perihilar haze suggesting
an element of fluid overload.

CXR: ([**10-15**]) Again seen are bilateral pleural effusions, moderate
on the left,small on the right and are of similar size and
appearance compared to the prior study. There continues to be
pulmonary vascular redistribution and cardiomegaly suggesting
CHF. An underlying infectious infiltrate in either lower lobe
cannot be excluded

CXR: ([**10-16**])  Decreased left effusion, consistent with history of
thoracentesis, without pneumothorax. A focal consolidation in
the re-expanded left lung is suggested and attention is
warranted on followup imaging.

CT Head: ([**10-11**])  No acute intracranial process. MR is most
sensitive in the
detection of acute stroke. Incidental notes as above.

CT CSpine ([**10-11**]): 1. No acute fracture of the cervical spine.
2. Incidental note is made of air within small to tiny venous
vessels
throughout the neck, presumbaly via injection. Correlate
clinically.

Doppler Abd US: 1. Shrunken cirrhotic nodular liver consistent
with known cirrhosis. No focal hepatic mass lesions are
identified. 2. TIPS stent is patent with normal directional
flow. However, velocities
are slightly lower than expected ranging from 69 to 72 cm/s
throughout. Short interval ultrasound followup is recommended.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions and trace infrahepatic
ascites.

EEG ([**10-13**]): This is an abnormal routine EEG in the waking and
drowsy
states due to a slow theta frequency background as well as
occasional
one to two second bursts of moderate voltage, sudden onset
polymorphic
theta/delta activity with sharp components. This is a
non-specific
finding but likely suggestive of an encephalopathy.


Brief Hospital Course:
*****FOLLOW UP: (The following should be followed up by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 42604**], PCP)***********
1. Cytology from the pleural fluid is being analyzed by
pathology at [**Hospital1 18**]. These results should be followed up.
2. CXR after pleural fluid was removed from left lung showed a
round focal consolidation in the re-expanded left lower lobe is
suggested. Follow up imaging as an outpatient is warranted.
3. Diabetes Management.
.
Assessment and Plan:
63 y/o M with PMHx of DM, Hep C cirrhosis and HTN who was
brought in by EMS after being found seizing with hyperglycemic
non-ketosis and abnormal LFTs.
.
# Seizures: Pt presented after seizure in the setting of
hyperglycemia. No prior history of seizures. Pt denies fevers,
substance abuse and tox screen negative. Seizure could have been
due to hyperosmolarity and electrolyte shifts in setting of
HONK. Low suspician for infection given normal WBC count
