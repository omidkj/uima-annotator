Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**4-17**] CABG x 1, pericardial AVR


History of Present Illness:
75 F with PMH severe AS, DVT, HTN, hyperlipid, presented with
SOB to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2152-3-22**] with CHF decompensation. The
patient has been hospitalized many times in the past several
weeks. She was at [**Hospital1 18**] for a cath in [**11-12**], in preparation for
AVR in [**4-13**]. At cath, pt was found to have RCA disease, moderate
OM, moderate LAD disease. Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1290**] sent pt for venous
US of legs for vein mapping. Pt was found to have a DVT and was
started on coumadin. She has been on coumadin for 3 months now.
Followup venous US of legs at [**Hospital1 1474**] during this
hospitalization showed no DVTs. TTE at [**Hospital1 1474**] showed EF 40%,
with AV area 0.7 cm2, consistent with severe AS.
.
Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 1474**] on [**3-22**] and discharged on [**3-24**], then
readmitted on [**3-27**] at 9 PM with hypoxic respiratory failure,
brought in by EMS. In the field, she was given lasix 80 IV x1
and morphine 12 mg x1, then lasix 80 IV x1 in ED. Initial SBP
was 140s, but decreased to 70s after intubation, and dopamine
was started for presumptive cardiogenic shock. Pt was found to
have an NSTEMI with CK 108, MB 4.5, Trop 2.9, Cr 1.2. Pt was
placed on Lovenox 80 mg x1 for DVT ppx. Pt was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for possible IABP for cardiogenic shock management and CT
[**Doctor First Name **] for planned AVR. Pt arrived intubated: AC 500/14/5/80%, and
febrile to 103 rectal.

Pertinent Results:
Cath [**2151-11-18**]:
1. 2VD.
2. Severe aortic stenosis.
LMCA - wnl
RCA - diffusely diseased, multiple 60-70% lesions
LCX - Co-dominant, large filling defect in the mid AV groove at
one point of bifurcation with the OM1; OM1 with ostial 50%
LAD - non-obstructive 40-50% mid vessel
LV ventriculography was deferred given the known lesion on the
AV
valve and critical Aortic Stenosis.
Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated normal right (RVEDP =
9 mm
Hg) and left (PCWP = 11 mm Hg) filling pressures. The LVEDP was
not
obtained due to known mobile mass on the aortic valve.

[**2152-3-24**] TTE:
EF 40%
1. Normal LV dimensions with mildly reduced LV systolic
function. The inferior and posterior walls appear hypokinetic.
2. RV size and systolic function wnl
3. Aortic valve is heavily calcified. Peak velocity across AV is
4.5 m/s. Mean gradient is 49, calculated AV area is 0.7 cm2
consistent with severe AS. Mild AR
4. Mild annular calcification with mild MR.
5. Other valves are normal with trace TR.
6. PASP 25-30

Brief Hospital Course:
75 F with PMH severe AS, DVT, HTN, hyperlipid, presented with
SOB to [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital on [**2152-3-22**] with CHF decompensation,
admitted here with septic shock.  She was treated in the cadiac
care unit until she was optimized for her AVR / CABG.
.
# Septic shock:
Pt was hypotensive and febrile to 103 on admission. Differential
included AV endocarditis, pneumonia, UTI, line infection,
hypothyroidism. CXR showed infiltrates which became more clear
with diuresis. Pt was covered with Vanco and Aztreonam for PCN
allergy. Levofloxacin was added on [**3-31**], since pt was still
having low grade fevers after 3 days, for double coverage of
gram negative organisms. Sputum culture grew out GPC. TTE and
TEE showed low likelihood of endocarditis, with severe AS, no
vegetation or mass seen on any valves. R femoral triple lumen
cath and REJ lines were changed to a RIJ swan. TSH was wnl.  She
finished a course for HAP with vanco / levo / aztreonam, and
remained afebrile in the five days prior to her surgery.
.
Pt's beta blocker and [**Last Name (un) **] were held for hypotension to SBP 75-85
on admission. Pt was transferred on dopamine, and was changed to
levophed after 1 day to maintain MAP>65. Cortisol stimulation
test was wnl. Pt's fluid status was based in first few days on
swan readings.  She was successfully weaned off of all pressure
support.
.
# Hypoxic respiratory failure:
Pt was transferred from OSH on AC vent, likely etiology due to
CHF exacerbation from pneumonia and severe AS. Pt was placed on
Vanc/Aztreonam, and Levofloxacin was added for double coverage
of gram negative organisms.  She was extubated one week after
transfer, and required to go back on BiPAP three times after
extuabtion; this was in the setting of increased HR / BP while
anxious, with presumed acute pulmonary edema.  She always
responded well to gentle diuresis, and was tolerant of BiPAP as
needed.  She was weaned to room air prior to surgery.
.
# Cardiac status:
Pump:
TTE [**2152-3-24**] showed EF 50%, E:A 1.25, critical AS, possible 1 cm
mass on aortic valve. TTE and TEE were performed, showing severe
AS and no vegetation or mass seen on any valve. It is likely
that hypotension at OSH may have been from low CO from severe AS
and from medications given in the field, and that sepsis was an
underlying cause.  She was preparing for AVR once her acute
issues were resolved.

She was taken to the OR on [**2152-4-17**] where she underwent a CABG x
1 (SVG->OM) and AVR (#23 pericardial). She was transferred to
the CSRU in critical but stable condition. She was extubated on
POD #1, and weaned from her drips and transferred to the floor
by POD #2. She had a short bout of atrial fibrillation post
operatively which resolved with amiodarone. She had no
complications and was discharge to rehab on POD#7.

Ischemia:
Pt had a troponin leak at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with a Trop 2.9.
Cath in [**11-12**] shows 2VD; LMCA - wnl; RCA - diffusely diseased,
multiple 60-70% lesions; LCX - Co-dominant, large filling defect
in the mid AV groove at one point of bifurcation with the OM1;
OM1 with ostial 50%; LAD - non-obstructive 40-50% mid vessel. Pt
was placed on ASA. Pt was not on a statin as an outpatient, and
was not placed on one inhouse.  She evidently had a history of
myalgias which were attributed to statins, so they were
discontinued.
.
Rhythm:
Pt remained in NSR during most of CCU admission. Pt became sinus
tachycardic on dopamine, and was changed to levophed as a
pressor.  She had an episode of atrial fibrillation, which was
new for her.  She was rate controlled with IV amiodarone, and
converted to PO amiodarone; she was continued on a beta blocker
once off of pressors.  She converted back to NSR, and remained
in that rhythm up until the time of surgery.
.
# Anemia:
Likely due to blood loss and anemia of chronic disease. Pt's Hct
continued to drift down slowly
