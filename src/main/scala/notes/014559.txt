Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2101-2-11**]
1. Percutaneous tracheostomy.
2. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.


History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 90434**] [**Known lastname 90435**] is a 79 yo Nepali M who presents from [**Hospital 11373**] with a large brainstem hemorrhage. The patient lives
alone and a neighbor checks on him regularly; Initially it was
not clear how well he speaks English. It was also initially
unclear whether or not he had close family in the US. Later it
turned out that there was a distant niece who checks on him
occasionally.
The patient was last seen well 24 hours ago. He was found down
at 2100, face down and unresponsive, with vomit and feces. EMS
found him with shallow respirations, blood pressures documented
between the 140s to 169, transferred to NVH where he received
one gram of dilantin was intubated (with Versed/etomidate/succ).
CT showed pontine/midbrain hemorrhage with extension into 4th
ventricle. He was placed in hard c-spine collar. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], on arrival BP 189 /78.
Neurosurgery was first consulted. Their examination revealed
absent corneals, pupils R 1mm and hippus, L pinpoint and NR,
upper extremities no response to noxious, triple flexion in
lower extremities. No intervention was recommended since there
was no hydrocephalus and a poor prognosis.

Past Medical History:
HTN

Social History:
lives alone, per records from [**Country 63412**], w/o family locally


Family History:
Unknown

Physical Exam:
On admission:
VS T afeb  HR 109  BP 133/83  RR 20s  on PSV
GENERAL
intubated, not sedated.
Traumatic skin tears on L forehead, knee.
Sclera anicteric, in hard C-spine collar.
RRR, no m/r/g
Lungs clear
Ab soft, nondistended, no masses
Ext warm and well perfused. 2 finger amputations on L hand.

NEURO:
CN:
Eyes closed. Pupils 1mm and nonreactive, fixed at midline. No
dolls eyes though head turning limited by collar. Slight corneal
present on R, absent on L. No gag or cough.

MOTOR/[**Last Name (un) **]:
Increased tone throughout.
With stimulation, limbs make slight posturing movements (flexion
of UEs, internal/external rotation of LEs) associated with fine
small amplitude tremor and muscle fasiculations.

Noxious stimulation: UEs slight flexion/internal rotation L>R.
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] flexion with antigravity movement at IP/quad
sustained.

DTR: 2+ and brisk, symmetric bilateral biceps, triceps,
brachioradialis, patellar, 1 Achilles. No clonus. Toes
downgoing.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2-16**]: Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in
comparison to [**2101-2-3**].
The tracheostomy tube tip is 3.1 cm above the carina. Heart size
is normal. Mediastinum is normal. The lungs are essentially
clear. There is evidence of bilateral nipples projecting over
the lung bases, unchanged. The right PICC line tip is at the
level of cavoatrial junction.

[**2-3**]: US LE's: IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in
either leg.

[**1-26**]: C-spine CT: 1. Widening of the intervertebral space at
C4-5 is likely related to a prior anterior wedge compression
fracture of the C5 vertebral body, although recent injury to the
anterior longitudinal ligament could cause a similar appearance.
If there are no contraindications and diagnosis is deemed
clinically relevant, evaluation of the ligamentous structures
with MRI is recommended.
2. Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine as
described above, including mild central canal narrowing at C2-3,
C4-5, C5-6, and C6-7.  Narrowing of the central canal
predisposes to spinal cord injury in the setting of trauma. MR
is more sensitive than CT for evaluation of spinal cord injury.
3. Increased size of the pontine hematoma.
4. Increased opacification of the left sphenoid sinus and
increased mucosal thickening of the right sphenoid sinus could
reflect an ongoing inflammatory process.


Brief Hospital Course:
He is a 79 yo M from [**Country 63412**], with reported h/o HTN, found down,
found to have large pontine/midbrain hemorrhage with extension
into 4th ventricle. Most likely etiology is hypertensive
hemorrhage. BP elevated at first arrival but then was
normotensive.  Initial neurologic examination was significant
for pinpoint pupils, absent brainstem reflexes, spastic
tetraplegia with posturing. Neurosurgery did not recommend any
intervention, as there was no hydrocephalus at that point.  The
course was complicated by absence of relatives/HCP to discuss
goals of care. He was admitted to the neuro ICU for monitoring
and supportive care.

Guardianship papers were filed.  However, with the impending
medical need for a tracheostomy and PEG he under went these
procedures and was transferred to the floor.  The court granted
a do not escalate care but did not warrant a withdraw of care.
A long court case evolved which was prolonged unnecessarily by
his court appointed lawyer. Despite the fact that his distant
niece came to the hospital and made his wishes very clear,
despite the fact that a religious person made it clear that it
would be against his religion to be kept alive if there was no
meaningful chance for a conscious life or a meaningfull
recovery, the court appointed lawyer insisted that we still did
not know his wishes.

His hospital course has been fairly uneventful exept for an
early bout of gram negative sepsis.   He was started on Vanc,
Zosyn, Cipro for coverage of GPCs and GNRs in sputum, GNRs in
anaerobic BCx.  CT abd pelvis demonstrated no evidence for
infection or malignancy.  Echo did not show any obvious
vegitations. He became afebrile and antibiotics were pared down.
He was placed on a course of DiCLOXacillin. He remained afebrile
and was transferred to the floor.

A court date again around [**4-25**] resulted in an order that
allowed his Guardian to make a decision to withdraw his feeding
tube and to make him comfort measures only.

On [**2101-4-29**], the resident was called to see patient for
prounouncement of death   Patient did
not respond to tactile or verbal stimuli, Pupils are fixed and
dilated, carotid pulses absent, no  heart sounds, no spontaneous
respirations, extremities warm.

TIME OF DEATH: 15:50 PM. His distant niece was notified and did
not agree to autopsy.  Attending and admitting notified.
