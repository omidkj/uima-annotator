[**1-17**] Head CT: Large acute-on-chronic left subdural hematoma, with
approximately 1.1 cm rightward shift of the septum pellucidum.
Significant mass effect demonstrated with effacement of sulci
involving the entire left cerebral hemisphere with ipsilateral
uncal herniation.

[**1-21**] Head CT: The large left subdural collection is essentially
stable in size. While it is predominantly chronic, there is
evidence acute blood products posteriorly, denser since the
previous study, which may be due to interim rebleeding or clot
retraction.

[**1-29**] Head CT IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage. No
significant change in large
complex left subdural collection allowing for differences in
patient
positioning.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the ICU with subdural hematoma and new onset
R facial droop.  As the pt was symptomatic from his chronic
subdural hematoma, pt underwent left frontal and parietal burr
holes for evacuation of subdural hematoma on [**2194-1-18**]. He
tolerated the procedure well however had new-onset rapid a-fib
and was admitted to the ICU. He was loaded with amiodarone and
then converted to PO however he then had another episode of
rapid a-fib and re-started on IV amiodarone. He was also placed
on Lopressor at this time. He then transitioned to POs and was
in Sinus Rhythm. He then developed an upper extremity DVT in his
R arm and was anti coagulated with Heparin and subsequently
found to have Pulmonary emboli and will need 3-6months of
systemic anticoagualtion. He was however clinically benign. He
had LENIs of his lower extremities and they were negative. He
was transitioned to coumadin however INR was supratherapeautic
to 5.4 and coumadin held. Today it is 3.2 and is currently
receiving 2mg daily. He had stable head CTs and neurologically
non-focal exam. He worked well with PT/OT and transferred to
rehab. He will follow-up with Neurosurgery, Cardiology and his
PCP.
