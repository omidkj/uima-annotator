Brief Hospital Course:
63yoW admitted for cardiac cath which revealed LM and 3VD. She
was then referred for coronary artery bypass grafting, and on
[**12-25**] she went to operating room for coronary bypass surgery,
please see OR report for details. In summary the patient had
LIMA-LAD, SVG->OM, SVG->PDA. She did well in the immediate
postoperative period, was weaned from the ventilator and
extubated several hours after surgery. She remained
hemodynamically stable and on post-op day one was ready to
transfer to the floors, however there were no beds available.
She was transferred the following morning and other than
intermittant burst of atrial fibrillation she had an uneventful
postoperative course. The afib was treated with Bblockers and
Amiodarone following which the patient converted to sinus
rhythm. She was initially anticoagulated however these were
stopped prior to discharge as the patient had converted to
[**Last Name (un) **] rhythm.
On potoperative day seven it was decided the patient was stable
and ready for discharge to home with VNA
