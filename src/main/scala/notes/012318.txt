Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 63-year-old female
patient with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, severe mitral regurgitation, significant
history of asthma with two recent hospital admissions to [**Hospital6 1760**] for asthmatic exacerbation.
She was also admitted to [**Hospital1 **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
through [**2182-12-14**] with severe mitral regurgitation and
rapid atrial fibrillation.  Heart catheterization was
performed on [**2182-12-16**], which revealed left
ventricular ejection fraction of 68%, single-vessel coronary
artery disease, questionable degree of mitral regurgitation,
and moderate pulmonary hypertension.

The patient subsequently had a retroperitoneal hematoma
requiring blood transfusion after cardiac catheterization.
The patient also had some prerenal azotemia which resolved
during that hospitalization.  The patient was subsequently
discharged home with a plan to be readmitted early in [**Month (only) 404**]
for mitral valve replacement with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 70**].

On the day of admission, [**2183-1-15**], however, the
patient was admitted with chest pain and palpitations which
was of fairly significant onset.  The patient had been on
Amiodarone at that time.  When EMS responded, she was found
to have a heart rate in the 130s, blood pressure 220
systolic.  She was given Aspirin and Nitroglycerin with
relief of her symptoms.  She was also treated with
intravenous Lopressor at that time.  The patient was admitted
to the Medicine Service.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Type II diabetes mellitus, atrial
fibrillation, hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency with
a baseline creatinine of 1.5-2.0, granulomatous hepatitis,
reactive airway disease with significant history of asthma,
3+ mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension,
status post 6 U blood transfusion for a retroperitoneal
bleed/hematoma status post cardiac catheterization, prerenal
azotemia, hematuria, partial small bowel ileus, history of
monoclonal gammopathy, status post total abdominal
hysterectomy for fibroids, history of hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. q.d.,
Diltiazem SR 180 mg p.o. b.i.d., Univasc 30 mg p.o. q.d.,
Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d., Premarin 0.625 mg p.o.
Q.d., Glyburide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d., Avandia 2 mg p.o. q.d.,
Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d., Colace b.i.d., Coumadin 2.5 mg p.o.
q.d., Asthmacort metered dose inhaler, Albuterol metered dose
inhaler, Prednisone 10 mg p.o. q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  On admission, exam revealed
the patient to be in no acute distress.  Neck:  Supple.  No
jugular venous distention.  HEENT:  Unremarkable.  Lungs:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:
Irregularly, irregular rhythm with a grade 2/6 systolic
murmur.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive
bowel sounds.  Extremities:  Without edema.  There were 2+
palpable dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.  Neurological:
Alert and oriented times three.  Nonfocal exam.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white blood cell count was
21.9; potassium 3.9, creatinine 1.5; the rest of the
admission laboratories were unremarkable; her INR upon
admission was 3.0, and she was on Coumadin.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medicine
Service.  Her Heparin was discontinued with the anticipation
of her needing to go to the Operating Room for her cardiac
surgery, and she was placed on intravenous Heparin drip.  An
Endocrinology consult was obtained on the day of admission.
It was their impression that the patient had thyrotoxicosis,
although mild.  It was their recommendation to rate control
the patient with beta-blocker as needed and to discontinue
the Amiodarone.  The Amiodarone was subsequently discontinued
on [**2183-1-16**].

On [**2183-1-17**], the patient was taken to the Operating
Room by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3876**] where she underwent a mitral
valve replacement with a St. [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] mechanical mitral valve,
#29 mm, as well as left-sided maze procedure.  She also had
removal of left atrial appendage.

Postoperatively she was transported from the Operating Room
to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit on epinephrine drip.
She was also on Levophed.  Both the epinephrine and Levophed
were weaned off readily.  She remained on Insulin drip and
some Nitroglycerin, as well as some Propofol for sedation,
and low-dose Dopamine drip for labile blood pressure.

On postoperative day #1, the patient was seen by the Renal
Medicine Service for increasing creatinine.  It was their
recommendation to let the patient stay with a higher blood
pressure for better renal profusion and to follow the
patient's potassium closely.

The patient was weaned from the mechanical ventilator and
extubated on postoperative day #1.  On postoperative day #2,
the patient remained in the Intensive Care Unit requiring
Insulin drip still for blood sugar which was not adequately
controlled.  She remained on low-dose Dopamine as well.
Amiodarone was resumed on postoperative day #2 due to
continued problems with atrial fibrillation.

On postoperative day #3, the patient was weaned off all
vasoactive drips, and he remained hemodynamically stable and
was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit to the
Telemetry Floor.  Cardiology Electrophysiology Service had
been following the patient, and they recommended to
discontinue the Amiodarone due to her preoperative problems
with thyrotoxicosis.  The patient had some intermittent
problems with nausea over the next couple of days.  The
patient required pulmonary toilet and bronchodilators,
however, remained essentially stable.

The patient had some difficulties with rapid atrial
tachycardiac arrhythmias, and the Electrophysiology Service
thought that she may at some point require an AB nodal
ablation with permanent pacemaker placement, and Coumadin was
discontinued on [**1-21**] for that reason.

Over the next 24-48 hours, from [**1-23**] to [**1-24**], the
patient had continuing problems with worsening shortness of
breath.  On [**1-24**], 6 p.m., the patient was transferred
back to the Intensive Care Unit due to worsening shortness of
breath.  She had bibasilar crackles, some hypertension to
150s to 170s systolic.  The patient had been on a
non-rebreather mask at that point.  Her respiratory rate was
in the 30s.

Over the course of the next three days in the Intensive Care
Unit, she had been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and
aggressively worked with diuresis and pulmonary toilet;
however, on the morning of [**1-28**], the patient required
reintubation for increasing shortness of breath and fatigue,
at which point she was sedated to tolerate mechanical
ventilation.  Subsequent sputum gram stain grew out
gram-negative rods; however, the culture was consistent with
oropharyngeal flora and budding yeast and no definitive
organisms.

A Pulmonary Medicine consultation was obtained on [**2183-1-29**].  It was their thought that the patient may have been
experiencing postpericardiotomy syndrome with questionable
exacerbation of her reactive airway disease.  For this
reason, it was their recommendation to increase her steroids.
She had been on her baseline of Prednisone 10 mg per day at
this time.  The patient also upon admission to the Intensive
Care Unit had a significant pleural effusion drained of
approximately 700 cc.

On [**2183-1-30**], the patient had significantly improved
from a respiratory standpoint after being on stress dose
steroids for about 48 hours, and she was extubated on [**1-30**], and significant improvement in her pulmonary status was
evident at that time.  The patient continued to do well
hemodynamically.  She was begun on oral medication and
nutrition which she tolerated well.  On [**2183-2-1**], the
patient was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit to the
Telemetry Floor once again.

Over the next few days, she had
