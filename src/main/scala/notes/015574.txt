.
CXR [**12-18**]:  1. No pneumothorax. 2. Worsening right middle lobe
opacification.
3. Possible small left pleural effusion.
.
CTA [**12-18**]:  1. Dense right middle lobe pneumonia.
2. No pulmonary emboli visualized. No large or central emboli to
account for the patient's hypotension. Subsegmental branches in
right lower lobe not evaluated and, thus, subsegmental emboli in
these areas cannot be excluded. 3. Questionable calcifications
in deep right breast. Note that the [**2131-6-7**] screening
mammogram report describes a wire fragment in the deep slightly
outer right breast.
.
CXR [**12-19**]:  IMPRESSION: Interval slight worsening of bilateral
interstitial and alveolar opacities consistent with pulmonary
edema.
.
CXR [**12-22**]:  IMPRESSION: Improvement since prior film with
significant resolution of the pulmonary edema but persistent
interstitial densities and focal opacities at right base, as
described. No pneumothorax.
.
U/S ABD [**12-23**]:  1) Partially distended gallbladder without
cholelithiasis. The gallbladder wall is thickened which could
represent early acute cholecystitis in the correct clinical
setting. A follow-up ultrasound or HIDA scan is recommended if
there is continued clinical concern.
2) Small amount of ascites which is seen tracking around the
gallbladder.
.
TTE:  The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity  size, and systolic function are normal
(LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with  mild global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. There is no mitral valve  prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary  artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.
.
CTA [**12-30**]:  1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
2. Pulmonary edema superimposed on a baseline of diffuse
emphysema, with nodular interstitial thickening suggesting
additional superimposed infection. The appearances of the lung,
and specifically, the areas of diffuse interstitial thickening
and pulmonary edema, have worsened significantly since the
examination from [**2131-12-18**]. The dense opacity at the right middle
lobe has improved, although there are new opacities in the
inferior aspects of the lingula and anterior left lower lobe.



Brief Hospital Course:
54yo woman with extensive psychiatric history presented with
RML pnuemonia.

Pneumonia:

- treated empirically for CAP with ceftriaxone/azithromycin
- completed 5 days of vancomycin; d/c after MRSA screen was
negative
- urinary legionella Ag was negative
- serial CXRs showed marked resolution of PNA w/ Abx treatment

Hypotension:

- although low bp at baseline, patient was aggressively
volume resuscitated in the ED and intially started on levophed
to keep MAP > 60.  She was not adrenally insufficient by
cortisol
stimulation testing.  She did not have any positive blood
cultures.
She was quickly weaned from the levophed, and maintained
appropriate
MAP without any pressor support.

Pulmonary Edema:

- developed pulmonary edema after fluid resuscitation,
requiring supplemental oxygen, bipap, and ultimately
intubation for progressive hypoxia and respiratory failure.

- aggressively diuresed with lasix, secondarily developing
metabolic alkalosis that responded to KCl infusion.

- weaned down from AC to Pressure support ventilation;
pressure support weaned, spontaneous breathing trial completed,
and patient was extubated successfully and transferred out of
the unit to the medical floor.  While on the medical floor she
was weaned off supplemental oxygen and was O2satting in mid 90s
on RA

Psych:

- Extensive psychiatric history.  While psychiatric meds were
held on admission, these were added back to her medication
regimen.
She was managed per this regimen with additional prn
anxiolytics.

Abdominal Pain:

-  Pt had some intermittent complaints of abdominal pain that
were pursued with abd ultrasound.  No significant pathology was
elucidated.  Her pain resolved by the time of discharge.
