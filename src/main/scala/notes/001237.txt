Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2712**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation for mechanical ventillation [**2178-8-26**], extubated on
[**2178-8-28**]
PICC line placed by interventional radiology [**2178-8-27**]

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known firstname 636**] [**Known lastname 107551**] is 85 year old woman with history of HTN, CAD
s/p MI, PAF (not on coumadin), CVA who presents from her nursing
home with several days of decreased po intake, hyponatremia,
increased leg edema, and now lower blood pressures.  Per her
aide the patient has had chronic left lower leg edema (history
of L hip fracture) and in the last several weeks has developed
new RLE edema.  She has also had significant decrease in
appetite in the last several weeks to the point that this week
she was only eating a few bites at each meal.  Per medical
records her electrolytes were checked on [**2178-8-20**] which revealed a
sodium of 123. She was subsequently started on NaCl tablets (1
po bid) on [**2178-8-21**].  Today her aide was concerned that she was
having episodes of decreased responsiveness.  She called the
patient's daughter and the nursing home subsequently transferred
her to [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.
.
In ED initial vital signs were HR 79 BP 68/45 T 99.8 RR 20 SpO2
98% 4L. Physical exam was positive for elevated JVD and lower
extremity edema. Labs were significant for Na 122, Cr 0.2,
Lactate 0.8, UA positive for [**10-2**] WBC and many bacteria. CXR
was concerning for a right middle lobe infiltrate. She was
started empirically on vancomycin, azithromycin, and
ceftriaxone. She was given a total of 3 L IV NS for her
hypotension with only a minimal response.  A right IJ CVL was
placed and levophed was started. Vital signs prior to transfer
to the ICU were HR 124 BP 121/52 (on 0.25 levophed) RR 17 SpO2
97% NRB.
.
On arrival to the ICU floor patient denies specific complaints.
On questioning she admits to feeling cold.  She admits to an
occasional cough at night productive of white sputum.  She
reports a history of chest pain but no recent episodes.  She
reports that when sitting up she occasionally feels lightheaded.
She denies any loss of consciousness. She endorses having a poor
appetite due to early satiety.  She denies fever, nausea,
abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, rash.
.
At baseline she is alert and oriented, nonambulatory and
dependent for most ADLS. She is incontinent of bowel and
bladder.  Her baseline blood pressures range from 101-118/66-70.

MICROBIOLOGY:
[**2178-8-22**] Blood Cultures x 2: negative
[**2178-8-23**] Blood Cultures: negative
[**2178-8-22**] Urine Culture: negative
[**2178-8-22**] Urine Legionella: negative
[**2178-9-5**]: CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE TOXIN A & B TEST (Final
[**2178-9-5**]):
         FECES POSITIVE FOR C. DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.

[**2178-8-22**] CXR:
Limited study due to lack of lateral view and patient's
positioning. Incompletely evaluated left retrocardiac opacity.
If clinically feasible, recommend repeat with PA and lateral
chest radiographs for better evaluation.  Patchy right base
opacity, raises concern for infection and/or aspiration.
Prominent bronchi with peribronchial thickening are noted in the
right infrahilar region, suggestive of bronchiectasis and
possible chronic inflammation.

[**2178-8-22**] HEAD CT:
1. Limited study by motion artifacts, but no evidence of
hemorrhage.
2. Moderate global atrophy, likely age related.
Moderate-to-significant
chronic microvascular ischemic disease.
3. Fluid in left mastoid air cells.

[**2178-8-23**] CHEST CT:
1. Moderate-to-large right and moderate left simple-appearing
pleural
effusions with intrafissural fluid on the right. There
collapse/consolidation of both right and left lower lobes,
likely related to compression atelectasis, although
superinfection cannot be excluded.
2. Soft tissue anasarca.
3. Severe mitral annular calcification.
4. 4-mm right middle lobe pulmonary nodule is likely benign;
however, if the patient is at high risk for intrathoracic
malignancy, a followup chest CT in one year can be obtained to
document stability [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 8773**] Society guidelines.

[**2178-8-25**] TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation (however may be underestimated due to
shadowing). There is moderate posterior leaflet mitral valve
prolapse. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

[**2178-8-27**] MRI C/T SPINE:
1. No high-grade cervical or thoracic spinal canal narrowing.
2. High signal within the central mid-thoracic spinal cord may
represent a
syrinx or prominent central canal.
3. Hetrogeneous thoracic aorta flow void, which may represent
low flow or
artifact.

[**2178-8-27**] MRI HEAD:
There is no evidence of acute infarct or mass. Again
demonstrated
is extensive increased FLAIR/T2 signal within the cerebral white
matter and brainstem compatible with underlying microvascular
changes. There is a focal chronic lacunar infarct in the left
