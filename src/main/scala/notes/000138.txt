Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 27772**] is an 81 yo female with PMH of trached since
[**Month (only) **] stomach mass, trouble weaning. Much of the history is
provided by her husband, who is her HCP, given her ventilatory
status. She was initially intubated for resection of a gastric
cardiac tumor, but had difficulty weaning from the vent with
complications including pna. She spent 72 days at [**Hospital 10287**] for this. She was discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**1-6**],
where she was slowly weaned. She underwent bronchoscopy and
endoscopy at [**Hospital3 **] roughly one week ago which showed
healed resection sites. She was at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab today when she
noticed sudden onset dyspnea and tachycardia.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 100.6 P 117 in afib BP 128/52
(decreased to 91/41 upon signout) R 36 O2 sat 95% on 100% FiO2.
She had no leukocytosis, HCT was 34, trop was 0.03 but CK was
36. Lactate was 2.9. CXR showed mild CHF, small bilateral
effusions, and a retrocardiac opacity. CTA showed PE in his LUL
pulm artery, right lung pna, and LLL collapse. UA was positive
for > 50 WBCs. Patient was given diltiazem, levofloxacin 750mg,
vancomycin 1g, ceftriaxone 1g, and started on heparin. 2 18 gage
PIVs were placed. UCx and BCx were sent.
.
On arrival to the ICU, she is intubated. She is resting and
comfortable. Denies abd pain, chest pain. She reports continued
SOB, though it is better than upon presentation to the ED.

Studies:
CXR AP [**2133-2-11**]:
Mild CHF with small bilateral pleural effusions and retrocardiac

opacity which may represent atelectasis and/or pneumonia. Would
recommend
followup post-diuresis.
.
CTA chest [**2133-2-11**]:
Pulmonary artery filling defects, consistent with acute
thrombus,
begin at the origin of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery
extending into segmental and subsegmental right upper lobe
branches. Focal acute pulmonary embolism is noted in the right
interlobar pulmonary aretery as well. Other pulmonary artery
filling defects appear peripherally located within the vessel,
perhaps representing recannulated arteries in the setting of
chronic embolism (i.e. branches to the superior segment of the
left lower lobe). . Breathing artifact obscures evaluation of
subsegmental levels, particularly to the right lower lobe. No
left sided pulmonary emboli are identified. There is no overt
evidence of right- sided heart strain. Atherosclerotic
calcifications involve the thoracic aorta and its branches
including the coronary arteries. There is no evidence of
pericardial effusion. Small scattered mediastinal lymph nodes
are identified though they do not appear to meet CT criteria for

pathologic enlargement. An tracheostomy tube appears
appropriately
positioned. Heterogeneous appearance of the thyroid with rim-
calcified left thyroid nodules are partially imaged.
Lung windows reveal extensive right lung peribronchovascular
opacity
throughout the upper, middle, and lower lobes. More
consolidative changes at the right base are also noted. There is
a small left pleural effusion with consolidation of the left
lower lobe consistent with collapse. Secretions are noted in the
left main stem bronchus extending into left lower lobe bronchi.

Although this exam is not tailored to evaluate abdominal organs,
limited
evaluation of the upper abdomen is unremarkable.
There are no bone findings of malignancy. Fracture deformity of
the left
seventh rib is old. Multilevel thoracolumbar bridging anterior
osteophytosis  is noted.
IMPRESSION:
1. Pulmonary emboli including those beginning at the origin of
the right
upper lobe pulmonary artery extending into segmental and
subsegmental vessels and another in the right interlobar artery.

2. Focal right basilar consolidation and diffuse right lung
peribronchovascular opacity is most concerning for infection or
aspiration, though the sequela of chronic emboli is in the
differential.
3. Left lower lobe collapse with opacification of lower lobe
bronchi, perhaps reflecting mucus impaction. Associated small
left pleural effusion.
.
TTE [**2133-2-12**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
There is an anterior space which most likely represents a fat
pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Preserved global left ventricular systolic function. No
significant valvular disease seen. No pericardial effusion.
.
Bilateral LENI:  No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either
leg.
.
CXR AP [**2133-2-13**]:
In comparison with the study of [**2-11**], there are persistent low
lung
volumes in this patient with a tracheostomy tube in place.
