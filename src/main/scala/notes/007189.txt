Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4654**]
Chief Complaint:
need for insulin desensitization

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
63yoWM DM, CRI with cr ~ 2.0), insulin-dependant since [**2131**] with
urticaria to insulin over past 6 weeks, transferred from [**Hospital1 3325**] for need for insulin desensitization.
Pt has had chief complaint of generalized urticaria for past 1.5
months. Pt has been on insulin for past year, ~10 months prior
to start of symptoms. His urticaria originated on his buttocks,
was treated initially with prednisone, then two days ago has had
worsening, generalized urticaria on his torso and buttocks, with
1 day of urticaria and rash on his bil upper arms. Patient's
insulin regimen has been lantus 39u [**Hospital1 **] and humalog sliding
scale. It was noted at OSH that 30 mins after administration pt
developed urticaria, noticed by staff. He was treated with
prednisone, benadryl, and iv zantac with moderate response.
There was no airway compromise noted. Endocrinology was
consulted, recommended levemir substitution for lantus with same
reaction noted, no airway compromise. Patient transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for insulin desentiziation.
Of note, hospitalist at [**Hospital1 46**] ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1528**] [**0-0-**]
page [**Pager number **]) reports no new other new drugs as inciting factor.
Transfer arranged for Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 2603**] and Allergy/ Immunology and
endocrinology to review case tomorrow before desensitization.
There was query as to whether insulin pump covered by insurance
per Dr[**Name (NI) 103739**] request.
Initial endocrine/[**Last Name (un) **] recs from fellow [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]:
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 103740**] for insulin specific IgE and IgG and protamine
antibodies (would ask pharmacy what all insulin formulations are
available at [**Hospital1 18**]).
Of note, pt recently hospitalized on Cape ~1month ago for
"burning on his spine," got LP, work-up for Lyme's DZ,
reportedly (-).
Upon transfer to floor, vss. ROS notable for decreased UOP over
the past two to three days, in addition to new upper extremity
rash and pruritus. No acute vision changes, headaches, chest
pain, shortness of breath, diarrhea, fevers, systemic illness,
or joint pain.

      Reference Range: Non-Reactive.


Brief Hospital Course:
63 yo M IDDM, cad, cri transferred from OSH with 1.5 months of
urticaria, likely from insulin preparations, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for allergy and endocrine consultation for insulin
desensitization.  Currently having recurrent uticaria on floor,
mild, treated with prn benadryl, on scheduled H2 blockers.  No
sx of uticaria for 24h at time of d/c - doing well with novolog
SSI - seen by [**Last Name (un) 387**] again at time of d/c with recs to cont SSI
with novolog and start qhs lantus 12u and d/c glyburide.  This
plan was d/w with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] - was ok with plan will pt will have
close f/u with AI (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] this next week and [**Hospital **] clinic,
pt given instructions to make appointments as such.
<br>

#) HIVES/UTICARIA
Although transfer for desensitization, given pt had been on
insulin for >10 months prior to symptoms (even though reports
suggest clinical signs worsen after administration of insulin),
differential should be expanded to include medication effects,
infectious cause, or vasculitiditis.
His lisinopril was started >1yr prior and now discontinued
initially [**12-29**] to concern as cause, kept off with SBPs in 90-100s
(though ASx).  He has been on metoprolol for years, as well as
asacol for his UC. He completed a 21d course of doxycycline in
[**Month (only) 1096**] for a tick-borne illness, even though serologies were
negative as per patient.
-*****Insulin Ab pending, C1 esterase pending at time of d/c -
PCP/Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]/[**Last Name (un) **] provider all to please follow-up on results
-D/W Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from AI - plan to d/c H2 blockers, only to use
prn benedryl if hives re-start - no monoleukast, no steroids,
and now d/c H2 blockers
-plan as d/w Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] to hold of further skin testing for now
as tolerating novolog and as present will not requiring
desensitization
<br>

# hyperglycemia/insulin desensitization: BS better controlled
now, intially with +ketones in serum at OSH. Will need to
control glucoses, despite risk for further allergic reactions,
at least with modest glucose parameter goals of <250.
- novolin ss post iv benadryl to maintain glucoses <250 o/n
along with glyburide 10 mg [**Hospital1 **]
- he has doses of novolin off benadryl with good effect
- diabetic diet
- patient strongly educated about the need for exercise
- greatly appreciate Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 20017**] recommendations:
- d/c po hypoglycemics (glyburide) at this time
