Admission Date:  [**2197-2-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2197-3-10**]

Date of Birth:   [**2128-1-30**]       Sex:  F

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

AGE:  69.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 31811**] is a 68-year-old
female with the past medical history significant for coronary
artery disease status post four-vessel coronary artery bypass
graft in [**2180**], with re-catheterization and PTCA in [**2187**],
history of atrial fibrillation status post cardioversion in
[**12/2196**], who presented with dyspnea.  The patient also has a
history of renal artery stenosis.  Increasing fatigue and
dyspnea occurred in the setting of attempts to decrease her
Lasix dose over the prior two weeks of admission.  She had
worsening abilities to do her activities of daily living over
the last two weeks being able to partially dress herself and
make it part way down the [**Doctor Last Name **] to being bedridden.  During
this time, she was undergone workup for renal artery
stenosis, which was seen on MRA and shown to have severe
stenosis of her right renal artery.  Renal scan, with flow
study, on [**2197-2-21**] demonstrated diminished function of the
right kidney and 30% smaller size.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for workup of her
progressive dyspnea.  Initially, she presented on the day of
admission to [**Hospital6 **].  She was found to be
bradycardiac to the 30s with blood pressure of 100/palpation.
She was started on a dopamine drip and then stopped.
Atropine was also given, but this did not help her heart
rate.  She was given 120 mg total IV Lasix and diuresed
....................cc.  She also got Aluterol nebulizers
times four with some improvement in her respiratory symtpoms.
She was sent to [**Hospital1 69**].  In the
ED, she was started on nitroglycerin drip and two more nebs.
Temperature was 96.4, pulse 50, blood pressure 178/88,
respiratory rate 20, 100% oxygen saturation on 4 liters nasal
cannula.  GENERAL:  In general, she was in mild distress.
Oropharynx was dry.  I was unable to assess JVD.  The heart
was bradycardiac, soft murmur at the apex.  Lungs
demonstrated poor air movement, scattered expiratory wheezes,
bibasilar crackles.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was
obese.  There was ecchymosis from EPO injection; unable to
assess for hepatomegaly, normoactive bowel sounds.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft [**2180**], PTCA in [**2187**].
2.  Refractory congestive heart failure, question of
diastolic failure.
3.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
4.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
5.  Renal arterial stenosis.
6.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation status post cardioversion,
1/[**2196**].

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Hydralazine 100 b.i.d.
2.  Levoxyl 100/1.
3.  Aldactone 25 b.i.d.
4.  Zaroxolyn 2.5 b.i.d.
5.  Amiodarone 200 per day.
6.  Plavix 75 per day.
7.  Zoloft 50 per day.
8.  Prevacid 30 per day.
9.  Aspirin 81 per day.
10. Lopressor.
11. Xanax.
12. Lipitor 40 per day.
13. Lasix 120 per day.
14. Vicodine p.r.n.
15. Serevent 2 b.i.d.
16. NPH 20 in the morning; 10 in the p.m..
17. Epogen 3000 units per week.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratory data on admission revealed the
following:  Negative troponin I.  Chest x-ray was consistent
with mild CHF.  The EKG showed Q and 3, T-wave inversions in
1, AVL, first degree AV block, incomplete right bundle branch
block.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and the course, by
systems, is as follows:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Echocardiogram was obtained on
[**2197-2-24**], which showed pulmonary hypertension, right heart
failure, but relatively LV function.

On [**3-2**], the patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization
laboratory for right heart catheterization and a renal artery
stent.  The patient tolerated the procedure well initially.
Cardiac catheterization confirmed pulmonary hypertension with
secondary right heart failure with pulmonary artery pressures
of 64/24 and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 28.
After the procedure, the patient developed ATN secondary to
dye contrast.

After placement of the renal artery stent the patient was
sent to the Coronary Care Unit for diuresis and monitoring
with pulmonary artery catheter.  She was then discontinued
from ACE inhibitors and continued on the negative fluid
balance and attempt to maintain her a renal dose of Dopa to
help perfuse her kidneys because of the dye toxicity.  Swan
Ganz numbers improved.  She was taken off dopamine on [**3-5**] and continued on diuretic to maintain her urine output.
She was also maintained on nitroglycerin drip for blood
pressure for greater than 120.

By [**3-6**], she was diuresing well.  She did not require
any diuretics after that.  On [**3-7**], she was more than
three liters negative in twenty-four hours.  Zaroxolyn was
discontinued, and the ATN was resolving.

She was transferred out of the Coronary Care Unit to the
floor.  Over the next twenty-four hours she had a total of
eight liters negative total body balance without any
diuretic.

She continued this course of diuresis for the next day.

During the hospital course, she was continued on Amiodarone
for atrial fibrillation.  She continued on Plavix, aspirin,
and Lipitor.

The source of her right heart failure is likely due to
pulmonary hypertension, which will be followed up on an
outpatient.

#2.  RENAL:  The patient has baseline chronic renal
insufficiency.  During this admission the patient had acute
renal insufficiency thought to be secondary to acute tubular
necrosis caused by contrast dye.  This has resolved and by
the day before discharge the creatinine was down to 2.7.  The
baseline creatinine was 1.8 to 2.  At the time of discharge,
the patient is probably still 5 to 10 liters positive and
will need to have continued diuresis until she is euvolemic.

#3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was seen by the Pulmonary
consultation during this visit.  CT scan showed ground-glass
opacities.  She was ruled out by VQ scan for chronic PEs.  It
is not clear what the etiology of her pulmonary hypertension
is, but this is likely related to obstructive sleep apnea
secondary to her obese body habitus.  It is recommended that
she followup in the Pulmonary Clinic for a sleep study in one
to two months after she is clinically stable.

#4.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient has chronic anemia, likely
secondary to renal failure and diabetes mellitus.  She
remains on iron and Epogen.

#5.  ENDOCRINE:  The patient remains on a stable dose of NPH
and regular insulin sliding scale.

The patient was afebrile during her hospital stay and did not
require any antibiotics.

She was seen by physical therapy consultation and it was
determined that she was going to need acute rehabilitation
following this hospital stay.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Amiodarone 200 per day.
2.  Lipitor 40 per day.
3.  Aspirin 81 per day.
4.  Plavix 75 per day.
5.  Hydralazine 100 q.i.d.
6.  Atrovent MD
7.  Serevent MDI.
8.  Levothyroxine 100 per day.
9.  Iron sulfate 325 t.i.d.
10. Renagel t.i.d.
11. NPH 26 units a.m.; 13 units p.m..
12. Regular insulin sliding scale.
13. Epogen 5000 units every week.
14. Neurontin 300 per day.
15. Ambien p.r.n.

The patient was discharged to rehabilitation hospital in good
condition.

Addendum is to follow to identify the actual site of her
discharge.
