Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2840**]
Chief Complaint:
Hyponatremia, altered mental status

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
This is an 85 y/o Russian-speaking M with a hx of dementia,
hypertension, hypothyroidism, and recent hyponatremia to 120 who
is admitted from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with altered mental status,
lethargy, and persistent hyponatremia x 5 days.
.
Pt has dementia at baseline. Per [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, mental status has
been waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**], with more confusion at night and in the
morning. Pt was described as drowsy and confused. Pt is
currently able to answer questions appropriately. Sodium level
has been stable in the 120s over the past 5 days. On [**6-12**], Na
was 121->124->125->121 today. He has not had any seizures at
rehab. He was also reported to have unwitnessed falls x 3 since
[**6-13**]. He normally ambulates with a walker under supervision with
unsteady gait. Via interpreter, he is unable to state the date
(reports his birthdate), place (says he's "been in the same
place for the past 24 hours"), but baseline is unknown. He
denied any CP, SOB, HA, dizziness, N/V, lightheadedness,
dizziness, imbalance, abdominal pain, or urinary symptoms. He
said he felt "perfectly fine."
.
[**Name (NI) 1094**] son was called, and reported that pt had appeared fine
until a few days ago when he seemed more sleepy. He reports that
pt just didn't "seem like himself" and was looking more "pale."
Son also confirmed that pt had had several falls, and says that
he did not have any head trauma. Son also reported some urinary
incontinence.
.
In the ED, VS were [**Age over 90 **]F 64 119/59 18 98%2L. He was given NS IVF x
2 L. CXR was a poor film due to pt's inability to sit upright,
but did not show any obvious infiltrates. CT Head was done and
did not show any bleed. Ventricles were noted as somewhat
prominent. Urine tox screen was negative. Labs were otherwise
notable for Na 120, Lipase 71, Crit 34.3. First set of CE showed
elevated CK 238, MB 10, MBI 4.2, Trop 0.01. Prior to transfer to
the floor, pt was trying to get out of bed to go home. Pt was
admitted for further management.
.

IMAGING:
[**2144-6-16**] CT Head: Prominence of the ventricles, likely related to
age-related atrophy, however, normal pressure hydrocephalus
cannot be excluded. No hemorrhage.
.
[**2144-6-16**] CXR
exam in wheelchair, ap and lateral view. Elevated left
diaphragm, probably related to gas distended stomach and some
large bowel loops. Crowed pulm vessels in this area but no
conclusive evidence of acute infiltrate.Pulm vasculature not
congested, no intersttial or alveolar edema in accessable
areas.Dropping head obscures apical area but no significant
pneumothora identified. We have no previous chest exam of this
patient in our records.
.
[**2144-6-16**] CXR
1. Elevated left hemidiaphragm with probable compression
atelectasis and/or effusion at the left base.
.
[**2144-6-17**] CXR
Comparison is made with prior study performed at the LA.
Unchanged elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. There are low
lung volumes, minimal atelectasis are seen in the bases
bilaterally. There is no pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is limited by elevation of
the left hemidiaphragm. There is no evidence of CHF. Moderate
degenerative changes are in the thoracic spine.
.
[**2144-6-17**] CXR: In comparison with the earlier study of this date,
the nasogastric tube extends to the mid body of the stomach,
then coils on itself so that the tip is projected close to the
esophagogastric junction. Increasingly low lung volumes with
elevation of the left hemidiaphragmatic contour and atelectatic
changes at the left base.
EKG: NSR 62, no STTW changes, nml axis/intervals
.
[**2144-6-17**] ABDOMINAL XRAY: Dilated but not distended small bowel
loops. Air and stool throughout the colon. No high grade
obstruction at this time, but early or partial SBO cannot be
excluded.
.
[**2144-6-19**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are
consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild diastolic LV dysfunction. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
