Service:  GENERAL SURGERY GOLD SERVICE

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 14625**] is an 86-year-old
woman who presents to the hospital with a three day history
of fever, nausea, vomiting, constipation and right upper
quadrant pain.  The pain was localized to the right upper
quadrant and the epigastrium without any alleviation or
worsening type factors.  The patient denied hematemesis,
hematochezia, bright red blood per rectum or melena.  She had
received three enemas for constipation with minimal results.
The patient denies any previous history of right upper
quadrant or epigastric pain.  She also denied any urinary
symptoms.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Choledocholithiasis with an ERCP in [**2171**]
2.  Temporal arteritis
3.  History of pneumonia

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Negative

MEDICATION:
1.  Prednisone 2.5 mg po qd for temporal arteritis and
calcium

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITAL SIGNS:  On admission, temperature of 101.2??????, blood
pressure 200/93, heart rate 105, respiratory rate 24 on 95%
saturation.
GENERAL:  The patient is alert and oriented x3.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.
ABDOMEN:  Slightly obese, distended abdomen with positive
tenderness in the right upper and lower quadrants.  There was
positive rebound in the right upper quadrant.  There was no
shaking tenderness, no masses and no hernias.  A [**Doctor Last Name 515**]
sign was positive.
EXTREMITIES:  No cyanosis, clubbing or edema.

PERTINENT LAB VALUES:  Elevated white count at 27.5.
Hematocrit was 39.4 and platelets were 422.  There was a left
shift with a 96% neutrophilia and 0 bands.  Panel 7 showed
sodium of 133, potassium of 4.5, chloride of 94, bicarbonate
of 23, BUN of 9 and creatinine of 0.7 with a glucose of 204.
Liver function tests were significantly elevated, showing an
AST of 379, ALT of 260, alkaline phosphatase of 658 and a
total bilirubin of 4.6.  The amylase was 46 and lipase was
17.  An arterial blood gas done at that time showed pH of
7.5, carbon of 33, oxygen of 54, bicarbonate of 28 and base
excess of 3.

IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram was performed which showed
normal sinus rhythm at 106 beats per minute with no ST
changes or Q waves.  An x-ray was taken which showed no free
air, but positive air fluid levels in the intestines with no
air in colon.  Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates and no
congestive heart failure.  A CT was performed as well, which
showed 1. intrahepatic dilation of the left lobe of the
liver, 2. portal vein occlusion, 3. non dilated gallbladder
with positive stones.  All of the intestinal and bowel
appeared okay.  The assessment at the time was that this was
a patient with a history of choledocholithiasis that appears
to have a cholangitis and she was admitted to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit for evaluation and treatment.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ms. [**Known lastname 14625**] was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit on the 16th and that evening had an ERCP performed.
The ERCP was performed without complication.  The findings of
that study were that the esophagus, stomach and duodenum had
a normal gastric mucosa.  The major papilla showed a
moderately stenosed prior sphincterotomy.  Cannulation of the
biliary duct was successful with a deep sphincterotome free
hand and contrast medium was injected showing complete
opacification without difficulty.  The biliary tree showed a
large amount of purulent material and two small stones were
seen to drain from the prior sphincterotomy site on
cannulating the bile duct.  The biliary tree was moderately
dilated to the intrahepatic ducts.  A filling defect
consistent with a stone was present in the distal common bile
duct.  A 5 cm x 10 French plastic double pigtail stent was
placed successfully in the common bile duct.

At this point, the patient was shown to have a suppurative
cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, status post stent
placement.  Post ERCP, the patient returned to the Intensive
Care Unit where she continued to be intubated and ventilated
for a probable chronic bronchitis versus chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease situation.  Ms. [**Known lastname 14625**] was difficult to wean
from the ventilator, but she was successfully extubated by
hospital day #2.  Ms. [**Known lastname 14625**] remained in the Intensive Care
Unit through hospital day #5 for close monitoring, at which
point she was transferred to the floor in stable condition.

NEUROLOGIC:  Ms. [**Known lastname 14625**] has a mild amount of dementia, but is
able to answer questions appropriately.  Her pain
significantly decreased after the ERCP and continued to
improve throughout her hospital course to the point in which
now she has no pain in her abdomen at rest and only mild
tenderness to palpation.

CARDIOVASCULAR:  Ms. [**Known lastname 14625**] went into an episode of rapid
atrial fibrillation on hospital day #2 while in the Intensive
Care Unit.  At that point, she was started on Lopressor, beta
block and prn and also was placed on Diltiazem for rate
control.  With the Lopressor qid, she spontaneously converted
back into normal sinus and remained normal sinus rhythm after
hospital day #3.  An echocardiogram was performed on [**9-30**] that showed normal ejection volume, no significant valve
disease and no obvious thrombosis with slight mitral
calcification.  The plan, as a result of this echocardiogram,
was that it was not necessary to anticoagulate Ms. [**Known lastname 14625**] as a
result of her isolated episode of atrial fibrillation with no
previous history of atrial fibrillation.  In addition, Ms.
[**Known lastname 14625**] has received a nitropaste patch for elevated blood
pressure which she can continue to use after discharge.
Also, cardiac enzymes were sent to rule out myocardial
infarction and an electrocardiogram was performed during her
episode of atrial fibrillation and all CKs were normal and
the electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with a normal axis,
flat T-waves and a single Q in lead 3.

RESPIRATORY:  Ms. [**Known lastname 14625**] has continued to need elevated oxygen
support with 40% face mask following extubation.  Her
saturations have remained in the mid to high 90s with oxygen
support and she has been weaned down to just a mild nasal
cannula oxygen for support.  Vigorous pulmonary toilet and
respiratory therapy has helped clear Mrs.[**Known lastname 14626**] lung
function over the past few days and she should continue with
this in her rehabilitation center.

GASTROINTESTINAL:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] cholangitis was appropriately
and successfully treated with ERCP and stent placement.
Following her ERCP, her liver function tests improved
significantly with AST and ALT down to the 177 and 215 with
alkaline phosphatase down to 417 and the total bilirubin
coming down to 3.8 from 4.6.  Her liver function tests
continued to improve with AST and ALT normalizing by hospital
day #5 into the 38 and 41 range.  Her total bilirubin
continued to come down to 1.7 and eventually to 1.3.
Paradoxically, her alkaline phosphatase has remained elevated
to 537 and up into the 900s, but this has also been coming
down and is below 900 on discharge.  She has been able to
tolerate solids without complication and is taking sufficient
po's at this time.  She has passed gas and has had loose
bowel movements.  A Clostridium difficile was sent which was
negative.

GENITOURINARY:  Ms. [**Known lastname 14625**] has had a Foley since her time of
admission which had a significant amount of leaking.  She had
a urinalysis sent on hospital day #6 which showed 2 white
blood cells and some elevated red cells to [**Pager number **].  She denied
dysuria.  The Foley was discontinued on the evening of [**10-3**] and Mrs. [**Known lastname 14625**] had some incontinence overnight.  She
will therefore need dressing or other assistance for proper
hygiene and bladder function.

HEMATOLOGY:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] white count has continued to fall
post ERCP from her admission level of 27.5.  It initially
went up to 32.7, but then came down to 14 f
