CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Persistent fevers in the setting of
chemotherapy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 50-year-old
male with a history of mantle cell lymphoma, blastic variant,
who presented on [**2173-3-11**] with fevers and a white blood
cell count of 1.2.  The patient was status post two cycles of
hyper-CVAD therapy with a downtrending white blood cell count
from this therapy.

The patient initially presented in [**2172-11-7**] when he
noted pallor and fatigue.  A laboratory workup at that time
showed him to be anemic with mantle cells in his peripheral
smear.  A computed tomography scan showed diffuse
mediastinal, axillary, retroperitoneal, and deep pelvis
lymphadenopathy.  In addition, the patient's spleen was
markedly enlarged.

In [**2172-12-7**] the patient [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] a cycle of
hyper-CVAD chemotherapy which was complicated by febrile
neutropenia.  In [**2173-1-7**], he [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] part B of this
first cycle of hyper-CVAD chemotherapy.  This was complicated
by mucositis.  In [**2173-2-7**], he [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] a second
cycle of hyper-CVAD chemotherapy.  In this session, the
patient was noted to develop atrial fibrillation which
spontaneously reverted to a sinus rhythm.  The patient also
[**Year (4 digits) 1834**] part B of the second cycle of hyper-CVAD in
[**2173-2-7**].

After the second cycle of hyper-CVAD therapy the patient
developed a cough productive of blood/green sputum.  The
patient had this cough two days prior to presenting to his
oncologist.  The patient presented for a computed tomography
scan for further workup of a nodule noted on chest x-ray.
During this presentation, the patient was found to be
febrile.  At that time, he denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
and abdominal pain.  His cardiac review of systems was
entirely negative.

The patient was admitted to the hospital for workup of his
fever.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
6.  Attention deficit disorder.
7.  Tourette's syndrome.
8.  History of left ventricular thrombus.
9.  History of cerebrovascular accident without residual
deficit.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.  He denies tobacco
or alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father had [**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer and coronary artery
disease.  Mother had a myocardial infarction at the age of
53.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
 1.  Acyclovir 400 mg three times per day.
 2.  Allopurinol.
 3.  Bactrim double strength on Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday.
 4.  Fluconazole 200 mg once per day.
 5.  Zestril 40 mg once per day.
 6.  Lopressor 50 mg twice per day.
 7.  Imdur 60 mg once per day.
 8.  Lasix 120 mg in the morning and 60 mg in the evening.
 9.  Digoxin 0.125 mg once per day.
10.  Folic acid.
11.  Prilosec.

ALLERGIES:  OXACILLIN.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 100.5,
his blood pressure was 140/82, his heart rate was 88, his
respiratory rate was 16, and his oxygen saturation was 92% on
room air.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed perioral lesions, multiple buccal lesion.  The
mucous membranes were moist.  Chest examination revealed
crackles at the bases bilaterally.  Otherwise, clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Heart was regular in rate and
rhythm.  There was a very mild 1/6 systolic murmur heard best
at the apex.  The abdomen revealed a minimally enlarged
spleen and nontender.  The abdomen was minimally distended.
There was no rebound or guarding noted on examination.  There
were normal active bowel sounds.  Extremities revealed no
clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  There was no lymphadenopathy
appreciated; no cervical, inguinal, or axillary.
Neurologically, the patient was alert and oriented times
three.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
to the Bone Marrow Transplant Service with a presumed
diagnosis of pneumonia.  Sputum was sent for culture.

Due to the patient's renal insufficiency, a computed
tomography scan was not immediately obtained.  The patient
was continued on his acyclovir and Bactrim prophylaxis.

A computed tomography scan without contrast was eventually
obtained on [**2173-3-13**].  The impression was new
development of diffuse patchy and nodular alveolar
opacification.  These were noted to be confluent in the right
middle lobe and left lower lobe.  They were indicative of an
infectious process.  The differential diagnosis included
viral, bacterial, fungal, or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
The patient was also noted to have significantly decreased
diffuse mediastinal, axillary, and hilar lymphadenopathy from
his prior examination.

With these computed tomography findings, the patient was
started on AmBisome in addition to cefepime and vancomycin.
At this time, he was saturating 94% on 2 liters, and his
respiratory status continued to decline over the following
two days.  In addition, the patient's white blood cell count
continued to fall; which was expected from his prior
chemotherapy.

Further complicating the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course was a
persistent nose bleed.  The patient's hematocrit dropped from
30 to 18 on [**2173-3-13**].  This responded to blood
transfusions.  An Ear/Nose/Throat consultation was obtained,
and the nose bleed was well controlled by keeping the
patient's platelets above 50 and his hematocrit above 30.

Both the Infectious Disease Service and the Pulmonary Service
were closely involved with the patient's care.  The patient
[**Year (4 digits) 1834**] a bronchoscopy on [**2173-3-15**].  During this
procedure, they performed a bronchoalveolar lavage of his
right upper lobe.  Specimens from the lavage were negative
for acid-fast bacilli.  Fungal isolates were negative.
Potassium hydroxide stain was negative.  Legionella culture
was negative.  No Pneumocystis carinii were noted.  In
addition, multiple blood cultures obtained from the patient
during fever spikes remained negative for bacteria.  The
sputum culture was negative for respiratory pathogens.
However, the patient continued to decline with regard to his
pulmonary status.

On [**2173-3-17**], he was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for his worsening pulmonary function and
for persistent atrial fibrillation (as described below).

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient was admitted to the
Bone Marrow Transplant team and continued on his cardiac
medications which included digoxin, Lasix, Imdur, Lopressor,
and Zestril.

The patient remained in a normal sinus rhythm and appeared to
be in very mild congestive heart failure.  His lungs had
crackles at the bases, and his jugular venous pressure was
minimally elevated.

On [**2173-3-15**], in the setting of receiving an albuterol
nebulizer, the patient went into an irregular heart rhythm.
An electrocardiogram was obtained which showed atrial
fibrillation.  The patient's cardiologist, who is on staff at
the [**Hospital1 69**], was notified and a
plan was obtained to control the patient's rate with
intravenous metoprolol and by doubling the patient's
Lopressor dose to 100 mg by mouth twice per day.   This
transiently kept the patient under a heart rate of 100.
However, he persistently had episodes of tachycardia to the
150s.  His Lopressor was then increased further to 100 mg
three times per day, and additional intravenous metoprolol
was pushed on three occasions.

Due to the inability of maintaining the patient's heart rate
below 100, he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit with a plan to start a diltiazem drip.

NOTE:  This ends my dictation.  The rest of this will be
dictated by the next intern.
