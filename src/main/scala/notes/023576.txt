Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1936**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, chills, transferred from outside hospital for ERCP to
evaluate pneumobilia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography

History of Present Illness:
HPI on transfer to Gen Med floor on [**10-24**]
Patient is a 78 year old male with a h/o htn, dementia and
hypercholesterolemia who presented to [**Hospital **] Hosp on [**10-22**] with
two days of fever and diarrhea. Per wife, he was at his USOH
until [**10-21**] night, but had temps to 102. Next am, was fine until
afternoon, developed rigors.  Has been having gas/intermittent
diarrhea on/off for weeks. No abdominal pain/vomiting.  On
arrival to OSH his temp was 103 and he was initially
normotensive. No leukocytosis, creat 2.4, LFTs wnl, lipase okay,
flu negative. Had episode of NBNB emesis. Underwent CT scan of
his abdomen which showed air in the biliary tree so he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] Surgical ICU for further management.  Got
flagyl and levo at OSH, 1L IVfs. En Route to [**Hospital1 18**], reported
hypotension/brady, thus on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], got 2L IVFs, BP
better since.
.
Since his transfer blood cultures from the outside hospital
became positive with 4/4 bottles growing [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] report. He has
been on Unasyn, he was also found to have [**1-21**] blood cx positive
from the ER for Gram+ cocci in clusters, Vanc started (stopped
[**10-24**] since CONS). He has been evaluated by surgery and ERCP
service [**10-22**]. Had a right upper quadrant ultrasound that showed
concern for possible air vs. stone in the gall bladder, and
possible air in the left lobe of the liver. These findings were
most concerning for biliary enteric fistula vs. emphysematous
cholecystitis, with emphysematous cholecystitis being less
likely base on imaging. Was still having fevers on [**10-23**]. Cipro
was added for double coverage.  After ERCP consult, it was
recommended that he undergo ERCP for further evaluation, so he
was transfered to [**Hospital Ward Name **] MICU to facilitate his procedure
and for further monitoring on [**10-24**].  Underwent ERCP on [**10-24**] with
sphincterotomy, stone fragment extraction, no pus, no fistula.
last temp was 103 on am of [**10-24**] (0500) a/w rigors (before ERCP).

.
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] course also remarkable for acute hypoxia, resp distress on
[**10-24**] am. Got lasix and nebs with some improvement. IVF stopped.
Echo with mod-severe MR, nl EF.
.
Was transfered to Gen Med evening [**10-24**] after ERCP. He currently
has no complaints, saying that he feels well.  Is npo given
ERCP.  his diarrhea is improving. Denies any fever/chills, chest
pain, shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting.

Imaging/results:
.
Renal US [**10-27**]: essentially normal. small 8mm AML upper pole L
kidney
.

CXR [**10-27**]: Two views of the chest demonstrate the lungs to be
clear. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
.
.
CXR [**10-24**]: The lung volumes are lower on the current study. There
is extensive bilateral perihilar new interstitial prominence as
well as newly developed left retrocardiac opacity that might be
a progression of pre-demonstrated abnormality on [**2159-10-22**]
radiograph suggesting worsening of infection in combination with
pulmonary edema. Followup of the patient after diuresis is
recommended to evaluate the relationship between suspected
infection and
pulmonary edema changes. There is no pneumothorax. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable
.
CXR [**10-22**]
IMPRESSION: Left basilar atelectasis. No focal consolidation
identified.
.
Echo: IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with normal LV cavity size
and normal systolic function. There is moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation - there is mild bileaflet prolapse. There may be a
partial flail of the posterior leaflet (images # 1 and 2). The
RV is mildly dilated/hypokinetic. Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.
.
RUQ U/S ([**10-22**]): wet read: gb collapsed with possible air (linear
hyperechoic foci with dirty shadowing) although stone could have
similar appearance- less likely given no stone on recent outside
CT images. possible air within left lobe of liver. no bil dil.
DDx includes recent procedure or possible biliary enteric
fistula.
emphysematous cholecystitis could also present with gb air,
however there is no inflammatory changes/wall edema or gb
distention.
.
.
ERCP [**10-24**]:
Impression: Normal major papilla.
No evidence of a biliary enteric fistula
An air pneumogram was seen on the scout image.
Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and deep with a
sphincterotome after a guidewire was placed.
Contrast medium was injected resulting in complete opacification

A distal CBD filling defect consistent with a small stone was
seen at the biliary tree.
There was no post-obstructive dilation
A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position using
a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire.
Multiple stone fragments were extracted successfully using a 12
mm balloon.
The bile duct was clear at the end of the procedure
(sphincterotomy, stone extraction)
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum
Note that there was no pus in the bile duct - it is not clear
that biliary sepsis is the cause of his recurrent fevers -
consider other causes

Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old male with h/o hypertension, DM on insulin, CKD IV,
chronic dCHF who presented to OSH [**10-22**] with one day of fevers,
CT scan concerning for pneumobilia so transfered to [**Hospital1 18**].  ERCP
done on [**10-24**] with CBD stone/sludge which was removed, but no pus
or fistula as suggested on CT/US. Found to have klebsiella
bacteremia with unclear source but most likey biliary as the
admission UA/CXR at OSH and here were unremarkable. Had daily
fevers until [**10-24**] am but has been afe
