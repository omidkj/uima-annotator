Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization ([**2150-4-2**])


History of Present Illness:
40yo M with h/o CAD (s/p 6 stents in the LAD, most recent was a
single [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] placed in LAD in [**2-/2150**] due to a 'fractured'
previous stent) and HIV on HAART presenting with chest pressure
and SOB. The patient reported that earlier in the day he was not
feeling 'quite right' but didn't think much of it. Then around
noon, he was out shopping and began to note that he was sweating
and having difficulty catching his breath. He also developed
substernal chest pain and left sided chest pressure. He also
felt nauseated and 'dry heaved' a few times this morning, but
did not think much of it as this is a chronic problem for him.
He had some b/l neck discomfort, but did it did not radiate down
his left arm. He was close by to [**Hospital1 18**], and decided to go see
his PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2148**] rather than driving back to [**State 1727**]. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 2148**] referred him immediately to the ED.
.
He was recently admitted to [**Hospital **] Hospital in [**State 1727**] on [**2150-2-26**] for
chest pain and STE in the anterior leads. He was found to have a
mid-LAD stent fracture occulding the artery. A DES was placed at
the site. He was then discharged on prasugrel 10 mg daily (he
had previously been on clopidogrel) and aspirin 325 mg daily. He
also underwent a TTE, which as per report, revealed a mildly
dilated left ventricle with an LVEF of 30% and akinesis of the
mid and distal septum and apex and infero-lateral segments. He
reports that his current presentation was more c/w with in
initial pain/pressure that he experienced in [**5-/2148**] when his
original stents were placed in the LAD. His presentation in
[**2-/2150**] was severe "pain" and different than this afternoon.
.
In the ED, his initial vitals were 99.1, 85, 124/91, 20, 98% ra.
His presenting EKG reportedly showed 1 mm STE in V2/V3, and Q
waves and biphasic Ts anteriorly although the official read is
pending. His labs and imaging significant for negative troponin
with a flat CKMB. The remainder of his labs were unremarkable.
He experienced a transiently drop in his BP (SBP ~108 from
120-130s) which improved with 1 liter of NS. He was evaluated by
cardiology who did not feel he required urgent catheterization.
He had already received aspirin today and takes prasugrel as an
outpatient. He was then started on a heparin gtt and admitted to
the CCU for close monitoring. Vitals on transfer were 99.1, p
81, bp 121/73, 12, 98RA.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient reports feeling well. He
continues to have 3/10 chest pain, but feels it is much
improved. No SOB. No N/V, no HA. No abd pain.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He has chronic night sweats. All of the other review of systems
were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Portable TTE ([**2150-4-1**])-
The left atrium is dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is severe regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid to
distal anterior wall, anterior septum, apical segments, apex and
distal inferior and lateral walls. There is an anteroapical left
ventricular aneurysm. There is no ventricular septal defect.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Borderline dilation of the left ventricular cavity.
Severe regional left ventricular systolic function consistent
with infarction in the distribution of the LAD. Mild mitral
regurgitation.

pCXR ([**2150-4-1**])-
1. Mild opacity at the right lung base is likely crowding of
vessels but could represent early infection in the appropriate
clinical setting. A lateral view could be performed for further
evaluation, if clinically indicated.
2. Nodule at the right lung base, potentially a nipple. Further
evaluation suggested with nipple markers in place.
