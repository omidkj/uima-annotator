Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
Laryngeal Mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p Tracheostomy, PEG tube placement, tooth extraction

History of Present Illness:
57yo female with history of coronary artery disease, Crohn's
Disease, hypertension, and COPD was admitted from the ED with
new laryngeal mass and airway compromise. Patient is a poor
historian, and much of the history was obtained from the chart.

According to OMR, it appears that patient has had a subacute
weight loss of nearly 20 pounds over the last 2 years of unclear
etiology. Additionally, she has had hoarse voiceness since
approximately [**11-18**]. She was initially diagnosed with likely
viral URI, but she was soon referred to ENT since her symptoms
persisted. Unfortunately a complete laryngeal evaluation could
not be performed due to stiffness and extra-pyramidal side
effects from her psychiatric medication. They had recommended an
exam under anesthesia, but she refused this. In [**8-19**], she was
found to have purulent drainage and likely skin infection on her
neck, and she was prescribed cephalexin initially and then
levofloxacin with minimal improvement. Ultimately, she had a CT
neck performed on [**2153-11-8**] which demonstrated a large laryngeal
mass, concerning for airway compromise. She was then referred to
the ED for further evaluation.

Of note, there has been continued concern with the patient's
primary care physician that patient may not be able to make her
own medical decisions. Her mother is listed as her healthcare
proxy, but her mother is elderly with many medical problems
herself.

Upon arrival in the ED, temp 98.9, HR 60, BP 141/68, RR 20, and
pulse ox 98% on room air. Exam was notable for marked laryngeal
mass with biopsy site without erythema or drainage. Labs are
notable for Hct 33.2 and Lactate 2.2.  ENT was consulted in the
ED, and they found patent airway without evidence of airway
compromise.

Brief Hospital Course:
57yo female with multiple medical problems including
schizoaffective disorder, coronary artery disease, hypertension,
and COPD was admitted with laryngeal mass, concerning for
malignancy.

1. Laryngeal Mass:
Biopsy demonstrated squamous cell carcinoma.  She was seen in
consultation by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] for
this.  PEG and trach tube placement was planned after careful
consideration and discussion with patient and her family - both
her sister (her HCP) and her frail though cognitively intact [**Age over 90 **]
year old mother.  PET scan was performed on [**11-14**] and showed her
known neck mass as well as 2 concerning lymph nodes.  Dental
recommended 5 extractions.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] from Oral Surgery
coordinated with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1837**] (trach) and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
(PEG) to have all three procedures accomplished at the same time
on Thursday, [**11-15**].   She also underwent tooth extraction
by oral surgery in preparation for XRT and chemotherapy.
Following surgery, Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for
post-trach care. Her course in the ICU was uneventful.  She was
transiently hypotensive, likely secondary to hypovolemia, but
was hemodynamically stable throughout and responded well to IVF.
 She was noted to diffusely rhonchous on lung exam, likely due
to inability to clear secretions, and was given nebs treatment
with clinical improvement.   CXR was clear.  At the time of
callout to [**Hospital1 **], she was breathing well on 40% trach mask, with
O2 sats of 100%.  Her pain is under good control with Fentanyl
patch and Tylenol.  Trach balloon was deflated.  She had
supportive care on the floor and trach and PEG site appeared to
be healing well. She did not tolerate trial of passy muir valve,
however the ENT team felt that it was very important not to
adjust the trach for at least 7 days when she will be seen in
their clinic.
.
2. Dysphagia with aspiration: Secondary to laryngeal cancer. She
had a video speech and swallow that demonstrated aspiration and
was recommended to be NPO. She initially refused NGT and PEG, so
was allowed to eat puree and thin liquids under direct 1:1
supervision for small quantities. She underwent PEG placement on
[**11-15**].  At the time of callout from [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], she started on tube
feeds and is NPO.  She underwent reevaluation on [**11-19**] and it was
felt that she should still be kept NPO with the exception of
coffee for taste with supervision. She should get reevaluation
through chemo/XRT to determine if/when it becomes safe for her
to take po.

3. Anemia: Normocytic, decreased from recent baseline but stable
in house. No evidence of bleeding, iron studies c/w aocd.

4. Benign Hypertension: Stable, ACEi held given her dysphagia
but metoprolol continued at 12.5 mg po bid.  She mainly got it
in the morning, but evening doses were held due to relative
bradycardia (HR 50's). All medications were restarted at
discharge per home doses and pt tolerated this.

5. COPD: Stable on room air, she was continued on albuterol and
ipratropium nebs prn

6. GERD: Stable, continued PPI iv due to dysphagia.

7. Neurogenic Bladder: Not symptomatic, her detrol was held
given dysphagia.

8. Hyperlipidemia: Her statin was held given dysphagia.

9. Psychiatric Disorder, Schizoaffective Disorder: She reported
initially self-discontinuing her zyprexa and per her outpatient
treater has not been compliant with depo haldol injections so is
essentially off medication. Given this psychiatry was consulted
with the specific question of capacity to make decisions. Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 98069**] felt Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a fairly good understanding (though
rudimentary) of why she needed to have the treatments and
surgery recommended.  Dr. [**Last Name (ST
