melanotic stool

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 60517**] is a 66 y.o. Male with a history of hepatic
sarcoidosis, ascites, ?cirrhosis, Grade I varicies, pulmonary
sarcoidosis, s/p recent hospitalization for melena requiring
PRBC transfusion presents for a TIPs evaluation.
.
Pt resides in [**Location (un) 3844**] and last week noted 3 days of
Melena, as well as general fatigue and weakness. Given that he
was just started on Iron supplements he decided not to come into
the hospital immediately, however after he noted some epigastric
pain on Satruday as well as a low grade temp his wife decided to
take him to the hospital.
.
Per the outside hospital notes that were faxed, on arrival to
the ED he was noted to have guaiac positive stool with no gross
frank blood. He was noted to be hypotensive at the time in the
60s (usual SBP is 90s), his Hct was 27.8 (his prior Hct baseline
is 27) and he was given IVF and transfused 2 units. He received
an upper endoscopy although it is unclear if this was performed
during his hospitalization course or whether it was done a week
prior. The upper endoscopy showed no gastric or esophageal
varicies but did show bleeding of the antrum as well as some of
the gastric body which was thought to be from gastric antral
portal hypertensive gastropathy. His bleeding was treated with
Argon plasma coagulation, and was thought to be
non-hemodynamically significant rectifiable only by liver
transplant or TIPs procedure. Following an appropriate reposnse
in his Hct from 27->32 pt was discharged with GI recommendation
of PPI therapy, follow up with his GI doctor [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 86**] and
periodic transfusions. After calling the transplant nurse pt was
recommended to come into the hospital for TIPs evaluation.
.
Of note pt was recently hospitalized early last month for TIPs
evaluation. His upper endoscopy on [**2101-7-10**] at [**Hospital1 18**] for
screening purposes during a hospitalization for abdominal pain.
At the time it showed only Grade 1 Varicies and the same gastric
portal hypertensive gastropathy. His Nadolol was discontinued
but then restarted by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 696**] given the portal hypertensive
gastropathy. The possibility of a TIPs was discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 696**] which per his note was not preferred given pt's cardiac
work up showing ejection of 45% and reversible perfusion defects
on stress MIBI. After this finding Cardiology were consulted an
pt was felt to be at high risk for bleeding given his
gastropathy and the need for antiplatelet therapy during
catherization.
.
Currently pt denies any fevers, chills, congestion, sore throat,
cough, shortness of breath, chest pain. He does have some
abdominal discomfort with his hernia around the umbilical
region. He still endorses melena but denies any nausea,
vomiting, constipation, hematochezia, hematuria. +diarrhea prior
to coming to the hospital for which he took Imodium.

Brief Hospital Course:
Discharge Summary per Floor Team

# Portal Hypertensive Gastropathy and associated melena - Mr.
[**Known lastname 60517**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] after discharge from OSH in New
[**Location (un) **] for possible TIPS procedure due to documented portal
hypertensive gastropathy with chronic oozing requiring multiple
admissions and blood products.  On admission, his stool was
noted to be guaiac positive, however he was not actively
stooling due to administration of immodium prior to drive from
[**Location (un) 3844**].  IV PPI was started and nadolol was continued on
admission.  Patient was started on bowel regimen. Type and
screen was kept active and access was maintained for possible
resuscitation.  After 2 days of admission, patient had a large
melanotic bowel movement.  Hematocrit was followed closely and
noted to return to baseline (he had been s/p 2 units PRBCs at
OSH) and then noted to be stable.  Due to history of portal
hypertensive gastropathy documented at [**Hospital1 18**] and recent EGD at
OSH, repeat EGD was not done.  After consulting cardiology,
decision was made to undergo TIPS without prior cardiac
catheterization.   TIPS was planned, however patient's renal
function declined and TIPS was postponed.  During this time
patient continued to have melanotic stools.  Nadolol was
discontinued on day 6 of admission due to heart rate in the low
60's so as to not mask tachycardia in setting of possible bleed.
 Hematocrit continued to be stable.  Renal failure improved,
however TIPS was postponed again due to diagnosis of SBP.

# Abdominal Pain - Mr. [**Known lastname 60517**] had abdominal pain on presentation
to [**Hospital1 18**].  Patient has chronic pain at baseline, but stated it
was an acute worsening.  Ventral hernia was examined and
determined to be reducable without pain.  Abdominal ultrasound
on admission showed cirrhotic liver, moderate-to-large ascites
and patent hepatic vasculature.  There was concern for possible
obstruction after no bowel movements for first 2 days, but KUB
did not support this diagnosis.  Diagnostic paracentesis on
hospital day 3 was negative for SBP.  Ab
