discontinued.  Pt was also inititated on Neupogen whicb was
discontinued prior to discharge as Neutropenia resolved. As pt's
oxygenation improved antibiotic coverage was changed to
meropenem, caspofungin were continued. Pt underwent bronchoscopy
with a BAL showing no nocardia, or PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] on this result pt
