Pertinent Results:
[**2132-9-29**] 10:15PM   WBC-9.9# RBC-3.81* HGB-11.7* HCT-33.5* MCV-88
MCH-30.8 MCHC-35.1* RDW-12.2
[**2132-9-29**] 10:15PM   PT-11.9 PTT-23.3 INR(PT)-1.0

CT Head [**2132-9-29**]: 1. No acute intracranial process. 2. Small
right parietal subgaleal hematoma.

CT C-spine [**2132-9-29**]: No evidence of acute fracture or
malalignment. Heterogeneous, enlarged left lobe of the thyroid,
not significantly
changed compared to CT from [**2132-8-11**].

CT Abdomen-Pelvis: 1. Displaced right posterior ninth and tenth
rib fractures with possible nondisplaced posterior right twelfth
rib fracture. No definite additional acute fractures, although
loss of height of a mid thoracic vertebral body is age
indeterminate. 2. Hyperdense 1.3-cm left renal lesion should be
further evaluated with non-emergent renal ultrasound. 3.
Concentric bladder wall thickening could be due to chronic
outlet obstruction given markedly prostatic enlargement.
Correlate with serum PSA/urinalysis. 4. Small right pleural
effusion. 5. Tiny left hepatic lobe hypodensities too small to
characterize. 6. Small hiatal hernia.

CTA Chest: 1. No evidence for pulmonary embolism. 2. Diffuse
consolidative and ground-glass opacities, concerning for
multifocal pneumonia likely with an element of superimposed
pulmonary edema. 3. Significant bilateral lower lobe
atelectasis. 4. Small non-hemorrhagic left pleural effusion.
Right chest tube in adequate position with trace anterior
pneumothorax. 5. Coronary artery calcification. 6. Large left
thyroid nodule, which warrants further evaluation with
ultrasound non-emergently if not performed elsewhere. 7.
Multiple right posterior rib fractures, right transverse process
fractures, and acute T10 compression fracture, as detailed
above.

[**10-5**] MRI C and T spine:  1. Acute compression fracture of T10
vertebral body with minimal retropulsion  and no significant
spinal canal compromise, as described above.
2. Multiple chronic compression fractures involving T3-T9
vertebral bodies, likely osteoporotic, with resultant marked
thoracic kyphosis and exaggerated compensatory cervical
lordosis.
3. Multifocal consolidations in visualized lower lungs and the
large nodule in the left thyroid lobe are better evaluated on
recent dedicated chest CT scan.
[**10-6**] CXR: Monitoring and supporting devices are in standard
positions including a right
chest tube with its tip terminating near the right lung apex.
Minimal
pneumothorax is evident at right lung and right lung apex, which
was not visualized on the prior chest radiograph dated [**10-5**], [**2131**] but demonstrated on much earlier radiographs through
[**10-2**] to [**2132-10-4**]. Minimal bilateral pleural
effusion, if any, is unchanged. Bilateral lower lung opacities,
left side more than right side representing mild atelectases is
similar.
[**10-7**] CXR: Previous pulmonary edema has improved. Heterogeneous
opacification throughout both lungs has been present since at
least [**10-2**]. Emphysema contributes to heterogeneity to
some extent, there is probably a large contribution of retained
secretions due to aspiration. Very small right apical
pneumothorax persists despite the right apical pleural drain.
Small pleural effusions are presumed, left greater than right,
but not changed recently


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted to the floor on the ACS service after falling
and fracturing multiple ribs. Initially he was doing well until
[**10-1**]: went into AFib with RVR (HR 140s) at 2:45 a.m. Treated
with IV lopressor and diltiazem. Transitioned to PO diltiazem.
Still in a. fib but rate-controlled. AM CXR right sided effusion
appears worse, ?hemothorax, attempting to contact healthcare
proxy; right CT placed by ACS. Converted back into sinus rhythm.
Become hypotensive to 70s systolic, bolusing fluid. D/w PCP,
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] concerned about home safety (lives w/ nephew in large
house, but alone most of the time, has fired home health aides).
FENa 0.08%, FEUrea 17.65%. O/n started Bactrim for UTI.

[**10-2**]: haldol dc'd, home carvidopa/levodopa dose, dc'd HCTZ,
metop 12.5'', CT to waterseal, f/u CXR minimal improvement (non
resolution of the right effusion); resp status poor (desats to
mid 80s without O2) worsened with increased secretions and
increased work of breathing on 100% NRB, intubated in PM, CT
back to sxn; famotidine ppx; bronched with secretions b/l and
BAL sent, aborted prior to completion due to Afib to 140s and
SBPs 80s-90s, s/p lopressor 2.5 x 2, dilt 10 x 1, dilt gtt -->
rate controlled but A-fib; leaking around foley, flushes without
issue, bed persistently wet, foley changed but issue persisted
with low UOP, 500 cc albumin x 1, looks concentrated

[**10-3**]: U-lytes FeNa 0.1%, 1L LR --> UOP responded, good MAPs, HR
controlled 80s-90s still in a-fib; weanted to CPAP 50/10/8 -->
ABG 7.45/31/72/22/0. Pt requiring high FI0s with no change in
oxygenation. Pt hypotensive after bronch. 500ml NS bolus given
with improvement of hypotension. CTA neg for PE but did show b/l
pneumonia. P/F ratio and CT chest consistent with ARDS. MV
changed to CMV. Fentanyl GTT added. TTE showed Nl RV function,
NL EF, mild AI, TI, and mild-mod TI
[**10-4**]: Repeat bronch, sent BAL from RUL. Placed R subclavian.
Chest tube to waterseal. Start tube feeds. Amiodarone IV x 24h,
then PO.

[**10-4**]: Repeat bronch, sent BAL from RUL. Placed R subclavian.
Chest tube to waterseal. Start tube feeds. Amiodarone IV x 24h,
then PO. Consulted spine re: spinal fx, await staffing.

[**10-5**]: CXR no change (no PTX); Cr 1.1->1.4, foley replaced in AM
(penile pouch removed), low UOP with high leakage around tube,
urology c/s: start ditropan 5''' for spasms, increase fluid in
balloon to 30 cc, PM Cr 1.5 and urine lytes FENa 0.2%, increased
TF free water 30-->100 Q4 and IVF@75/hr x 1 L; amio IV to PO,
cards c/s: amio 400'', only 5 gm load, full consult to follow;
in normal sinus rhythym; MRI for spine eval; vent weaning
CPAP/MMV --> 50/8/8; TF goal changed to 55/hr; abx dc'd in PM

[**10-6**]: Extubated in am. Received lasix 40mg x2. HLIV. Holding PO
meds for now, desats when attempting to place dubhoff. Switched
to IV amio.
[**10-7**]: per neurosurg, pt needs TLSO brace for ambulating, OK to
sit up or be out of chair without brace (brace ordered through
OMR orthotech).  Speech and swallow eval ordered. Spoke with
healthcare proxy. Leaning towards comfort care. Code status
changed to DNR/DNi. No escalation of care. Nephew to visit
tomorrow. Plan to have multi-discplinary meeting with family

[**10-8**]: per S/S eval, OK to take PO meds, but no other intake;
home meds ordered.  Family meeting held - family clear that they
do
