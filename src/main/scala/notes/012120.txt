ADDENDUM:  Please refer to the previous discharge summary and
the previous discharge summary addendum.

The following addition has been made to the patient's
medication regimen:  Since the patient has had repeated
Clostridium difficile infections despite Flagyl therapy, the
decision was made to continue the patient on p.o. Flagyl for
eight more days but then to continue p.o. Vancomycin over a
slow taper over six weeks as per the recommendation for
recurrent Clostridium difficile colitis.  The taper is
outlined as follows:  125 mg p.o. Vancomycin four times a day
times three more days from [**2173-5-4**], through [**2173-5-6**], and
then 125 mg p.o. twice a day times seven days from [**2173-5-7**],
to [**2173-5-14**], and then 125 mg p.o. once daily times seven days
from [**2173-5-15**], to [**2173-5-22**], and then 125 mg p.o. every other
day times seven days from [**2173-5-23**], to [**2173-5-30**], and then
finally 125 mg p.o. every three days for fourteen days from
[**2173-5-31**], through [**2173-6-14**].  In addition, the patient's left
upper extremity ultrasound was negative for deep vein
thrombosis and is most likely secondary to anasarca since the
patient has bilateral lower extremity and right arm edema as
well.  She most likely does have a low albumin and this would
be the most likely explanation for her left upper extremity
swelling.  The left AV fistula was patent with no signs of
bleeding.  All other medications and discharge summary
information as per previous discharge summary and discharge
summary addendum.
