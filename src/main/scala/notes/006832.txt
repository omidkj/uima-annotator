History of Present Illness:
77M with h/o ESRD on HD (T/Th/Sa at [**Location (un) **] [**Last Name (LF) 4265**], [**First Name3 (LF) 805**]
nephrologist, missed session day of admission), HTN, who
presented to ED with fever to 100.4F at home, productive cough
and congestion x 4-5 days. He admits myalgias, decreased energy,
and poor appetite. He vomited a few times, but in context of
paroxysms of coughing. Due to these symptoms, he did not go to
HD on the day of admission. His wife had similar symptoms last
week. He states that he has not felt SOB at home, but that once
arriving in the ED, he has felt a bit SOB, better when sitting
upright. He had an influenza vaccination [**9-5**], and a pneumovax
in [**2196**]. He denied any lightheadedness, chest pain/pressure,
abdominal pain, nausea, increased output from his ostomy bag, or
urinary symptoms. Initial labs were notable for wbc 6.7 with
91%N, and lactate 2.1. CXR demonstrated mild interstitial edema
and minimal blunting of costophrenic angles bilaterally, with
possible mild retrocardiac opacity. Blood cultures were sent,
and he was given a dose of vancomycin and levofloxacin. Of note,
he has a recently matured AV graft (placed [**2200-12-18**]) which has
been used for HD over the last 2-3 weeks, with plans to d/c his
R permacath line in the near future. He was admitted to the
medical service for further evaluation and management.
.
While on the floor, pt had recurrent fevers (up to 102.4 today),
and blood cx's grew out 4/4 bottles coag neg staph from [**2-10**]. He
was treated with vanc, as well as 1 dose of gent. His R sided
permacath was pulled, which also grew coag negative staph. He
continued to spike fevers despite Abx treatment, and today his
SBP dropped to the 70's after returning from dialysis
(reportedly no fluid was removed during dialysis). He also had
worsening mental status, so a neurology consult was called to
evaluate for possibility of septic emboli (TTE could not rule
out vegetation).

Transoesophageal echocardiogram on [**2201-2-17**]:
IMPRESSION: Deformed aortic valve but no discrete vegetation or
abscess (does not exclude endocarditis). Mild-moderate aortic
regurgitation. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
.
CT Head on [**2201-2-15**] to rule-out septic emboli:
IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial hemorrhage.  Unchanged left
parietal
meningioma.  Otherwise, no mass effect.  Mucus retention cyst in
the left
maxillary sinus.  Please note that MRI is more sensitive than
this CT scan for the assessment of acute infarction or
meningitis.
.

Echocardiogram on [**2201-2-13**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.  There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular  cavity size is
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There
is no  ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion  are normal. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The  aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. An aortic valve  vegetation/mass
cannot be excluded. There is severe aortic valve stenosis  (area
<0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve  leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is  seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on the pulmonic valve.
There is a small pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2200-7-29**],
the severity of AS, MR, TR and pulmonary hypertension detected
is worse. If clinically
indicated, a TEE would better excldue endocarditis.
.
ECHO on [**2-23**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a moderate
sized pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs
of tamponade. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of
[**2201-2-20**], there is more echo dense material in the
pericardium/pericardial space consistent with organization.
.
CXR on [**2-14**]
IMPRESSION:  Right effusion layering out.  Left retrocardiac air
space disease - atelectasis versus pneumonia appears greater
than prior.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 56835**] is a 77-year-old man with a history of ESRD on HD
who presented to the ED with 4-5 days fever, congestion, cough,
and malaise.
.
1. Cardiac Arrest. On the day of death, Mr. [**Known lastname 56835**] was
completing his final inpatient hemodialysis before his expected
discharge. Immediately after completing the session, he became
hypotensive with SBP in the 80s. He was noted to be in a fib w/
RVR. Fluids were given back wide
