Brief Hospital Course:
85yo man with CLL, CMV adrenalitis with adrenal insufficiency,
chronic voriconazole treatment for invasive aspergillosis
admitted for hypokalemia in the setting of diarrhea.
.
# Infection: There was initially concern for a worsening
pneumonia, but Infectious Disease did not feel this was the
case.  The patient was diagnosed with a resistant Pseudomonal
UTI, and was treated for this initally with ceftazadime, and
then fosfomycin.  He will receive fosfomycin chronically, every
10 days, to prevent future UTIs given that he requires a Foley
for urinary retention.  His 1st post-hospitalization dose of
this should be [**2195-8-28**].
.
# Diarrhea with hypokalemia: The patient's diarrhea was
significant, and was initially thought to be
antibiotic-associated.  He required significant IV repletion of
his potassium.  C. diff testing was negative, and a repeat stool
culture (prior from 12d prior to admission was negative) and ova
& parasites were no growth to date at the time of discharge.
Because of persistent diarrhea despite loperamide, GI was
consulted.  They recommended adding Lomotil, which was done, and
helped decrease his stool count.  On discharge he was having
only [**1-30**] stools a day, and his hypokalemia had stabilized, and
required only oral repletion.  He should be re-evaluated for
this in a few weeks (see follow-up appointments) and if his
diarrhea has slowed (as his bowel recovers from broad spectrum
antibiotics), his anti-diarrheals may be able to be tapered or
stopped, and his oral potassium may be able to be stopped.
.
# Atrial fibrillation -- continued home aspirin and metoprolol.
He has been deemed a poor candidate for anticoagulation given
his fluctuating platelet counts with CLL and high risk for fall.
.
# Urinary retention: Due to BPH. Urinary retention being managed
as an outpatient by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) 151**] chronic Foley to be changed
q4wks.  His Foley was changed on [**8-16**].

# CLL: Supportive care only. Last treated with alemtuzumab from
[**11/2194**] through [**1-/2195**], discontinued due to infections. IVIG
given [**2195-8-6**]. Continued TMP-SMX PPx.
.
# Adrenal insufficiency/CMV adrenalitis: Continued home steroid
regmien: hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. Also continued
valgancyclovir daily for CMV prophylaxis.
.
# Aspergillosis: Galactomannan negative, beta glucan
indeterminate. Voriconazole level therapeutic.
.
# Asthma: Well controlled on home regimen. Continued same.
.
# Lower extremity edema: Etiology unclear. Echo [**2-/2195**] showed
normal LVEF and no evidence of diastolic dysfuntion or R sided
failure. Likely due to CLL adenopathy.  Continued furosemide
40mg daily and fluid restricted to 2L/d.
.
# Code status: The patient was DNR/DNI during this admission.
.
DAY OF DISCHARGE
Interval hx: The patient felt well, as he had for days. His
diarrhea had slowed significantly since the addition of Lomotil.
 His potassium was stable and had only been repleted with oral
medications.  He understood and agreed with the plan for
discharge.  I spoke with his wife who understood and agreed.  I
reminded her of the importance of his [**2195-8-26**] appointment and
suggested using that as an opportunity to readdress the issue of
his anti-diarrheals.
