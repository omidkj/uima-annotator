History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 91074**] is a 62 y/o M with PMH of hypertension, not
currently on any medications, who is being from OSH for chest
pain, elevated troponin for catheterization. The patient reports
that two days ago, he developed chest pressure and tightness,
moving from right side of chest to left side, as well as
associated back tightness.  He was painting the walls of a room
when the pain started.  Denies ever having pain like this in the
past.  Reports associated shortness of breath, diaphoresis.
Denies any nausea/vomit.  The patient reports that the pain
lasted for 10-15 minutes then resolved.  Reports that his next
pain episode was the following day, and he thinks it occurred at
rest and also self resolved.
.
Over the last 2-3 weeks, the patient's wife reports
progressively worsening shortness of breath, as well as
decreasing exercise tolerance.  According to the patient's wife,
he cannot walk more than a few steps without getting short of
breath, and needing to rest.  Denies noticing any new LE edema.
Also notes wheezing for the last two weeks. For the last [**2-3**]
months, the patient's wife reports new orthopnea; he cannot
sleep laying flat, has been sleeping sitting up in chair
instead.  She also reports that he has a history of snoring at
night; recently has been more and more tired during the day,
often falls asleep while sitting up talking to his wife during
the day.  The patient has not seen a doctor in 3 years; has been
told that he was hypertensive, used to take medications for it,
but then self d/ced all medications because he reports feeling
"fine."
.
At presentation to OSH,  EKG notable for normal axis, sinus
tachycardia 121 bpm, LA enlargement, TWI V4-V6, ST depressions
in II, V4-V6.  Troponin I 1.01.  Nitro drip was started for
elevated pressures.  Pt was started on heparin drip, Plavix
loaded with 600 mg, Metoprolol 5 mg IV x3, Lasix 40 mg x1.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further cardiac workup.
Cardiac surgery was consulted for evaluation of coronary
revascularization.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed

anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. Results were personally reviewed with the MD
caring for the patient.
Conclusions
PRE-CPB:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No thrombus is seen in
the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D
or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and
moderate LV chamber dilation. There is moderate to severe
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. All basal
segments appear moderately to severely hypokinetic except for
the inferior basal segment which is severely hypokinetic,
bordering on akinetic. All mid segments are moderately
hypokinetic except for the inferior and inferolateral segments,
which appear severely hypokinetic. The apical inferior and
inferolateral segments appear mildly hypokinetic, while other
apical segments appear relatively spared. The estimated EF is
20-30%. The right ventricle shows mild global free wall
hypokinesis.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No
thoracic aortic dissection is seen.
