PORTABLE AP CHEST AT 2:30 AM, [**2131-7-3**]: Comparison is made to
[**2131-7-1**]. NG tube tip remains within the stomach. The left
PICC tip is in the distal SVC. There is evidence of volume loss
in the left hemithorax with herniation of the right lung across
the midline and leftward displacement of the anterior junctional
line. There is no pneumothorax. The volume loss is likely in the
left lower lobe as there is evolving retrocardiac opacity. Also
noted on this study, which does not persist on subsequent
studies, is mild tracheal narrowing at the level of the aortic
arch. There is slight worsening opacity in the left upper lobe,
which could be due to aspiration or asymmetrical edema, or
pneumonia.


Brief Hospital Course:
This 64 year-old gentleman with a history of alcoholic
cirrhosis, prostate CA s/p brachytherapy and radiation therapy,
COPD, and dementia was admitted to the ICU for a 2 to 3 week
history of increasing abdominal girth, bright red blood per
rectum, and malaise that had been worsening [**12-28**] d PTA.  In [**Name (NI) **] pt
found to be hypotensive and tachycardic P in 100's BP at 95/50,
BP improved with 3 L NS but tachycardia persisted.  On exam pt
was jaundiced with tense abdominal ascites.  Some bright red
blood per rectum.  Neurologically the pt had a tremor.
Creatinine was normal.   Liver enzymes found to be markedly
elevated.  Ceftriaxone started empirically for the possibility
of subacute bacterial peritonitis.  Hepatology service
consulted, recommended commencing pentoxifylline for prevention
of development of HRS.

Pt was transferred to MICU for concern for hypotension which
could have been secondary to one or all of the following
possibilities 1) sepsis 2) liver failure 3) acute blood loss.
In addition, given his history of alcohol abuse and the presence
of tachycardia and tremor concern was also raised for alcohol
withdrawal syndrome progressing to delirium tremens and CIWA
protocol was started.

On transfer to MICU pt went into respiratory distress, this
resolved adequately with inhaler therapy and continuous positive
airway pressure support.  Throughout his hospital course, the
patients hemodynamic status was tenuous, frequently having
elevated respiratory rates along with low normal blood pressure
and frequent tachycardia.  Per his partner, it was established
on HD 2 that he wished to be DNR/DNI from a living will he had
earlier wrote.  Other major events of his hospital course
included a paracentesis on HD 4 that removed 2 L and resulted in
some symptomatic improvement.  Analysis of this fluid was
remarkable only for serum ascites albumin gradient consistent
with portal hypertension.  Pt was generally afebrile and, until
HD 6 did not appear septic.  His BRBPR resolved and hematocrit
remained generally stable throughout his course.

  In early morning of HD 7, pt was found to be in respiratory
distress with oxygen saturations falling to 80-90 range and
respiratory rate ranging from 30-40.  Serial chest x-ray
demonstrated rapidly evolvling L lung field infiltrates,
consolidation and collapse consistent with aspiration pneumonia.
 Levofloxacin and flagyl were started along with continuous
positive airway pressure support.  In spite of these measures
the patient rapidly deteriorated into respiratory failure.  No
further interventions could be performed in the patient as his
code status was DNR/DNI.  The patient expired on 1:30 PM on
[**2131-7-3**].
