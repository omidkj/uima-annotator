Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
need for possible esophageal and Y-stent placement

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Radiation therapy to lung mass


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 87136**] is a 69 year-old man with COPD and newly diagnosed
right lower lobe poorly differentiated NSCLC w/ bulky
mediastinal lymphadenopathy and obstruction of the esophagus and
distal trachea and bilateral mainstem bronchi. He was initially
transferred to the MICU from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital after being
admitted on [**2166-7-16**] for evaluation for esophageal and Y-stent
placement for compressive lung mass. VS on arrival were T 97.0,
BP 130/60, HR 110, RR 24 with sat 94 on 10LNC.

About two months ago, he presented with hemoptysis and, with the
workup, ultimatley had a biopsy around 3 weeks ago. He has lost
35 lbs due to anorexia and difficulty getting food down. He had
a PEG tube placed on [**2166-7-17**]. MRI head at OSH was negative for
mets. He was managed with duonebs, IV solumedrol and
azithromycin at the OSH, though his respiratory status continued
to decline.

In the MICU, he was started empirically on vanc/unasyn for
aspiration pneumonia and seen by IP. They felt that his hypoxia
was most likely secondary to right pulmonary artery compression
from the mediastinal mass/LAD, and did not feel that he would
benefit from Y-stent placement. However, if one were placed,
they recommended evaluation for simultaneous esophageal stent
placement. They also recommended chest CTA to rule out PE (he
previously had chest CT with contrast at OSH but was not
protocoled for PE per report), and urgent rad onc consult.

He is transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] today for initiation of radiation
simulation and with first session of XRT to begin this
afternoon. Vitals immediately prior to transfer were 97.3 99-110
20 147/62 95%NRB, up from 10L nasal canula on arrival to the
MICU.

ROS is notable for dyspnea, back pain, headache, occ cough. It
is negative for FC, abd pain, change in BM.

Chest CT [**7-25**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive mediastinal, hilar lymphadenopathy involving the
entire
mediastinum and hila bilaterally, with minimal change within the
right hilum compared to prior study. The lymphadenopathy encases
aorta, right main pulmonary artery and SVC as described in
details in the body of the report. Interval increase in
pericardial effusion is noted, small-to-moderate.
2. Right lower lobe mass, unchanged.
3. Bilateral pleural effusion, unchanged.
4. Large right adrenal mass, no comparison with prior studies is
available
and this area was not included on the prior outside study.
5. Multiple mesenteric lymph nodes most likely representing a
similar
process.
6. Hypodense pancreatic lesion, significance is unknown, might
represent IPMN or involvement of the pancreas by metastatic
process as well.
7. Status post PEG insertion due to significant compromise of
the esophagus by lymphadenopathy.
8. Metastasis involvement of L1 by lytic lesion with soft tissue
component.  No involvement of posterior endplate and spinal
canal is seen at this point.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 y/o gentleman with RLL NSCLC and extensive mediastinal
lymphadenopathy that is compressing the esophagus, left lower
lobe segmental bronchi, and right pulmonary artery; he was
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] while he completed his radiation course.
The patient did develop atrial fibrillation and rapid
ventricular rate that was controlled with Metoprolol.

PROBLEM LIST:
#. [**Name2 (NI) 87137**]/Hypoxia:  New diagnosis of lung cancer with involvement
of mediastinum and compression of right pulmonary artery, distal
trachea, bilateral mainstem bronchi, and esophagus.  Transferred
to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for expedited XRT and monitoring during therapy.
Hypoxia likely multifactorial with right pulmonary artery
compression, ? of post-obstructive pneumonia, and airway
compression. Pt was given 5 days of XRT to fairly wide area in
chest. After few days started having difficulty with substernal
chest pain likely [**12-24**] to mass effect and post-radiation
changes/inflammation. He was also treated with a 7 day course of
vanc/unasyn for emperic coverage of post-obstructive pna. All
micro culture was negative. DNR/DNI status was established at
initial presentation. A palliative care consult was obtained due
to the nature of the disease process. Pain control recs were
left and followed and a discussion was started about long term
plans. Family expressed interest in having pt with son in [**Name (NI) 86**]
area with home hospice. Pt expressing interest in going home to
[**Location (un) 3844**]. Dr.[**Name (NI) 8949**] office called to schedule f/u
appointment in case pt stays in [**Location (un) 86**] area on D/C.

#. Pain, right chest, tumor-related: Fentanyl patch, as needed
morphine.

#. Atrial Fibrillation: Pt with new onset of Afib during the
evening of [**9-2**]. Also with RVR tachy to 150s. EKG showed no
signs ischemia. 5mg of IV metoprolol x 2 slowed rate to 110-120s
but not further and BP bottomed to 90s/60s. Metoprolol was
changed to QID. HR slowly increased again to 150s over next [**12-25**]
hrs but pt spontaneously convereted to sinus early in AM with no
further intervention. It is thought that a combination of atrial
compression from the mass and radiation change to the atrial
area precipitated the Afib which did not reoccur while in the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Discharged on Metoprolol 50mg PO Q8hrs.  Recommend
increasing to 50mg PO Q6hrs if patient has recurrent rapid
ventricular response.

#. RUE swelling/erythema: noted on [**7-26**]. Concern for DVT or SVC
syndrome as come evidence of SVC compression on chest CT. U/S
RUE showed occlusive clot of cephalic vein (superficial vein)
but no DVT.

#. COPD:  Initially treated for COPD exacerbation at OSH with
azithro and solumedrol. Pt was kept on standing
ipratropium/albuterol + PRN albuterol for SOB but steroids were
discontinued per rad onc request while on XRT.

#. Back pain:  History of distant back surgery and patient
reports chronic back pain x decades, no worsening in last
several months. Rad Onc okayed NSAIDs during therapy so high
dose Ibuprofen was started in addition to standing opiods.

#. HTN: On metoprolol mostly for rate control.

#. DVT prophylaxis: Heparin subcutaneous

#. Code status: DNR/DNI
