Pertinent Results:
[**2195-8-31**] ECHO
PREBYPASS
The interatrial septum is aneurysmal. A patent foramen ovale is
present with right to left flow demonstarted with agitated
saline comtrast and Valsalva/release.. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the apex distal anterior,
inferior, lateral and septal walls and mid anterior,
anteroseptal and inferoseptal walls. The remaining wall are
hypokinetic. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= <20 %). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen
(within normal limits).

POSTBYPASS
There is improvement of the inferolateral and anterolateral
walls.(LVEF 20-25%) Akinetic areas remain unchanged. RV systolic
function remains unchanged. No color flow Doppler is visualized
through the interatrial septum. No agitated saline contrast is
visualized across the septum and rest or with Valsalva/release.
MR remains trace.

[**2195-8-31**] Carotid U/S
No hemodynamically significant stenosis.

[**2195-8-28**] Cardiac Catheterization
1. Coronary angiography in this co-dominant system demonstrated
three
vessel disease. The LMCA was long with mild luminal
irregularities. The
proximal LAD had focal calcification and was totally occluded
after a
high 1st diagonal branch and 1st septal branch. The mid-distal
LAD
filled vial left-to-left collaterals. The 1st diagonal branch
had mild
luminal irregularities. The LCx had proximal-mid vessel tapering
that
culminated in a 60% stenosis before OM2. The OM2 had mild origin

stenosis. There were distal collaterals from the LCx to the
RPL/RPDA
system. The RCA had diffuse disease with a 70% proximal
stenosis, a 50%
mid stenosis, and a 80% distal stenosis with subsequent total
occlusion.
There was minimal filling iof the distal RCA, RPDA, and RPL.
2. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left
sided
filling pressures with RVEDP of 14 mmHg and LVEDP of 18 mmHg.
The
pulmonary arterial systolic pressure was normal at 27 mmHg. The
cardiac
index was preserved at 2.8 L/min/m2. There was normal systemic
arterial
pressure with SBP of 101 mmHg and DBP of 61 mmHg.
3. There was no evidence of significant right-to-left or
left-to-right
shunting based on oxygen saturation.
CXR: [**2195-9-4**] FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**9-2**], the
right IJ sheath has been removed. There is a persistent, though
apparent decreasing opacification at the left base, consistent
with effusion and atelectasis. Mild atelectatic changes are seen
at the right base medially.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 82897**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2195-8-28**]. He underwent a
cardiac catheterization which revealed severe three vessel.
Given the severity of his disease, the cardiac surgical service
was consulted for surgical revascularization. He was worked-up
in the usual preoperative manner including a carotid duplex
ultrasound which showed no hemodynamically significant disease.
On [**2195-9-1**] Mr. [**Known lastname 82897**] was taken to the operating room where he
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels and
closure of a patent foramen ovale. Please see operative note for
details.

Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated. On [**2195-9-2**], Mr. [**Known lastname 82897**] was transferred to the
step down unit for further recovery. He was gently diuresed
towards his preoperative weight. His electrolytes were repleted
as needed.  The chest-tube and pacing wires were removed per
protocol.  He was followed by serial chest films which revealed
small left lower lobe effusion with atelectasis.  The foley was
removed and he voided without difficulty. The physical therapy
service was consulted for assistance with his postoperative
strength and mobility. He was started on coreg 3.125 which he
tolerated.  His home meds were restarted.  His pain was well
controlled with Dilaudid and motrin.  He tolerated a regular
diet. He made steady progress and was discharged to home on
[**2195-9-5**].  He will follow-up as an outpatient.
