Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 31014**]
Chief Complaint:
concern for STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2160-9-26**] Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 49yoF with h/o CVA [**2157**], MI in [**2156**], COPD, OSA,
current smoker, recent hospitalization concerning for possible
aortic vasculitis, who is presenting to CCU from the cath lab
with concern for STEMI. She initially presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**9-25**] with worsening chest pain, SOB, diaphoresis,
and nausea. Pain was [**3-23**], worse with position changes. ECG
showed STE's in II, III, and AVF. She was hemodynamically
stable. She was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac
catheterization, which showed...
.
Of note, she was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**9-24**]. She initially
presented on [**9-16**] with fever, headaches, transient vision loss,
chest pain, and bump in troponin to 1.13. MRA showed evidence of
aortic arteritis, and there was substantial concern for giant
cell arteritis (GCA) vs Takayasu vasculitis. However, temporal
artery biopsy was negative for any evidence of GCA. She was
initially treated with pulsed prednisone, but developed a
substantial rash and then was switched to dexamethasone. In the
setting of concern for vasculitis, she did not have a
catheterization, as coronary cath from [**2157**] was clean, thus
lowering suspicion for ACS. She was discharged with plan for
stress test
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of deep
venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of
surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools
or red stools. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

IMAGING:
Cardiac cath [**2160-9-26**]:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant
system demonstrated no obstructive disease.  The LMCA was
angiographically normal.  The LAD had an ostial 20% plaque
(unchanged
from the [**2157**] catheterization).  Otherwise, the LAD had no
angiographically apparent disease.  The flow was somewhat
sluggish
distally (similar to prior catheterization).  The LCx had a
40-50% focal
lesion just proximal to the OM take off.  This appears worse
than prior
catherization but was not flow-limiting.  The RCA had mild
serial smooth
30% proximal and mid lesions.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated markedly elevated
left-sided filling pressure with an LVEDP of 26 mmHg.  Stage II
arterial
systemic hypertension was present with a central aortic pressure
of
170/100 mmHg.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Diastolic Dysfunction.
3. Stage II Systemic Hypertension.
.
TTE [**2160-9-26**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
hyperdynamic systolic fu
