Pertinent Results:
CXR [**1-23**]
IMPRESSION: No failure. Lungs clear. Trachea widely open.

CTA [**1-21**]
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
2. Stable emphysema.
3. Unchanged appearance of tracheal and left mainstem bronchus
stents. Soft tissue located distal to the left mainstem bronchus
stent is either granulation tissue or retained secretions.
4. Stable subcentimeter hypodensities within the liver, too
small to characterize.
5. Hyperenhancing nodular areas in the spleen, likely
hemangiomas but not fully characterized on this single phase
study.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient underwent bronchoscopy by Interventional Pulmonology
for evaluation of her stent placed for TBM.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well, but in the PACU she developed
respiratory distress and chest pressure upon ambulation.  The
patient was then admitted to the MICU on bipap for further
management.  CTA was done which showed no evidence for pulmonary
embolism. Enzymes were sent to rule out an ischemic event.
LENI's and an echo were performed which showed no evidence of
clot burden or right heart strain, but the patient was started
empirically on a heparin gtt.  On POD#1, the patient was
transferred to the floor.  The patient continued to have
complaints of shortness of breath and anxiety.  On [**1-25**] the
patient was discharged home.  Upon discharge, the patient was
afebrile with all vitals stable, tolerating po feeds, ambulating
well, and with pain controlled.
