2 [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 10157**] placed in LAD.
.
EKG: [**Hospital1 **]: ST elevation V2-V3 with Q waves. [**Hospital1 18**]: ST
elevation V2-V6.

Echo ([**11-17**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
moderate hypokinesis of the mid to distal anterior and
anteroseptal segments and the apex. There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with moderate regional LV
systolic dysfunction consistent with CAD of the LAD. No
significant valvular pathology seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
 ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 56 year old male transferred to BIMDC for
anterolateral STEMI s/p 2 DES to the LAD. Requiring 3-6 months
coumadin for akinetic wall.
.
# CORONARIES: Patient presented with anterolateral MI, s/p 2 DES
to the LAD (99% occlusion). Patient with circumflex lesions (60%
ostial, 70% OM1, 80% mid circumflex).
- Discharged on ASA, Plavix
- Atorvastatin 80 mg (despite elevated AST--needs to be
followed)
- Beta blocker, ACE inhibitor as pressure tolerates.
- Stress test with MIBI in 6 weeks to assess burden of
circumflex dz and f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] after.
.
# PUMP: No signs of heart failure on exam (no crackles, JVD,
edema). Significantly depressed EF with hypokinetic wall on
echo.
- Pt will require 3-6 months of anticoagulation with coumadin to
prevent LV thrombus. INR=1.9 at time of discharge, pt discharged
with Rx for 5mg dose, he will have his INR checked two days
post-discharge and sent to his PCP who will follow his INR
thereafter.
- [**Name (NI) 8863**] [**Name (NI) 8864**]
- Pt instructed to discuss with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]: cardiac rehab
available through his insurance network in the area
.
# RHYTHM: Normal sinus rhythm with occasional accelerated
idioventricular rhythm (6 beat max). Re-perfusion rhythm.
.
# Tobacco use: Pt given Rx for Chantix and given material re:
smoking cessation
