EGD [**2134-7-16**]: Impression:
Medium hiatal hernia
Erythema in the esophagus compatible with esophagitis
Blood in the whole stomach
A red localized clot with likely vessel was seen in the antrum.
The mucosa was heaped up around this adherent clot but no
discrete ulceration was seen. The lesion was not actively
bleeding at the time of endoscopy. in the stomach (injection,
endoclip)
Normal mucosa in the duodenum
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 23081**] is a 60 yo F with a past history of CAD s/p CABG, PVD
s/p recent SFA stent, Carotid steonsis s/p CEA, DM, CKD, CHF
presented with weakness, dizziness and was found to be anemic
with HCT 22 from baseline 35. She was found to have a clotted
vessel in antrum on EGD which was subsequently injected and
clipped. This bleeding vessel likely due to PUD in the setting
of antiplatelet medications (Plavix and ASA.)
.
# Anemia: Secondary to acute blood loss. Upper GI source was
identified on EGD (ulcer vs. dulefoy's lesion, wasn't clear) and
clipped.  Patient was given 3 units PRBCs and IV PPI.
Hematocrits increased throughout hospitalization. Discharge
hematocrit was 30.  Plavix and aspirin, and hypertensives were
initially held given blood loss and relative hypotension.  At
time of  Metoprolol, Lasix, and Spironolactone as well as
Aspirin were restarted at home doses.  Upon discharge, the
patient was hemodynamically stable with SBP in 120s and HR
ranging 80s-90s.  The MICU team discussed holding Plavix with
her cardiologist who agreed to this, but Ms. [**Known lastname 23081**] has been
instructed to followup on whether to continue to hold Plavix as
well when to restart her other antihypertensive medications
(losartan and amlodipine) with her PCP and Cardiology. Patient
started on [**Hospital1 **] PPI and will need an outpatient colonoscopy with
repeat egd in [**4-27**] weeks with biopsies for H. Pylori.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: initial Cr 2.3 that improved
to 1.3. This was likely pre-renal in the setting of poor forward
flow and hypovolemia from GI bleed.
.
# Asymptomatic but culture + UTI: Patient has a history of
pan-sensitive Klebsiella UTIs with sulfa/cipro/levo allergy. We
did not want to give nitrofurantoin with renal failure and so
began treatment with Ceftriazone (1 day) which was switched to
Cefpodoxime for a 6 day course (day 1 [**2134-7-17**]).
.
# Diabetes Type 2: Before admission, the patient reported
difficult to control blood glucose levels at home over the past
2 days. She was initially placed on reduced insulin regime with
SS and then increased to home insulin once eating/drinking. BS
continued to be high- given HgA1C 12.4 [**2134-6-4**], we increased
Lantus to 23 U for discharge. We recommend that this patient be
followed by a NP[**MD Number(3) 18184**] PCP's office for close diabetic F/U.
.
# HTN:  Patient is normally treated for hypertension with
Metoprolol, Amlodipine, Lasix, Spironolactone and Losartan.
These meds were initially held on admission and Metoprolol,
Lasix, Spironolactone were restarted. She needs to followup with
her cardiologist and PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]: when to restart Losartan and
Amlodipine. The patient has CHF, with EF40% remained
euvolemic/hypovolemic throughout admission.
.
# Chest Pain: She did complain of mild chest pressure once
during admission, but ruled out for MI with two sets
