Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1493**]
Chief Complaint:
upper GI bleed at OSH, admitted for evaluation of TIPS patency

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TIPS revision
EGD x 4

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 53 year-old male with history of NASH cirrhosis
complicated by multiple UGIBs, s/p TIPS placement in [**5-29**] with
revision in [**5-29**] after UGIB, also recent aortic valve
endocarditis [**1-1**] complicated by 3+ AI, and recent
hospitalization [**7-1**] at OSH for UGIB, now admitted from Dr. [**Name (NI) 8390**] clinic for evaluation of TIPS pressures. The patient
reports he was hospitalized at [**Hospital 50686**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 3441**], NY
for an upper GI bleed and encephalopathy from [**2177-7-8**] - [**2177-7-16**].
Per report from the patients wife, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] saw him in clinic
on [**7-17**] and sent him in for evaluation of TIPS pressures because
of the recent GI bleed. The patient reports he is feeling well
except for some fatigue.  Per the wife, his encephalopathy is
almost back to normal although he is still slightly confused
about some things.  On ROS the patient denies F/C, HA/
dizziness, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, n/v/d. The patient
is currently listed for liver transplant.

IMAGING:
.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2177-7-17**]
IMPRESSION: Patent TIPS with wall-to-wall flow and velocities
ranging from 85 to 112 cm/sec. Unchanged right pleural effusion
and a small amount of ascites.
.
ECHO [**2177-7-17**]: Conclusions: The left atrium is moderately
dilated. The left ventricular cavity is  moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent
with normal LV diastolic function. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is a small vegetation on the aortic valve.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic
velocity is likely related to increased stroke volume due to
aortic regurgitation. Moderate to severe (3+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2177-5-14**],
the aortic valve vegetation appears smaller. Left ventricular
size and aortic regurgitation severity is similar.
.
TIPS REDO  [**2177-7-18**]: IMPRESSION:
1. TIPS venogram demonstrates no open large varices, and a tight
stenosis on the hepatic venous side of the TIPS stent.
2. Successful dilation of that stenosis with a 10-mm balloon and
with good angiographic results.
3. Initial gradient of 20 mm Hg between the portal vein and the
right atrium that was decreased to 7 mm Hg after balloon
angioplasty of the TIPS narrowing.
.
LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  [**2177-7-19**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Patent TIPS with wall-to-wall flow and velocities increased
now ranging from 116 to 157 cm/sec.
2. Small amount of ascites and large right-sided pleural
effusion.
.
[**2177-8-1**] Abd US complete: IMPRESSION:
Patent TIPS catheter with wall-to-wall flow. Maximum peak
velocities in the proximal, mid and distal portion of the TIPS
catheter are overall unchanged since the prior study. However,
the average velocity in the distal portion of the TIPS appears
to be slightly higher on the current examination, not a
significant difference, however.
.
[**2177-8-3**] CXR: Feeding tube has been removed. Cardiac silhouette
remains enlarged with associated vascular engorgement and
perihilar haziness accompanied by an asymmetrical perihilar
alveolar process, worse on the right than the left. As compared
to the recent study, this has minimally worsened in the interval
and likely represents asymmetric pulmonary edema from either
fluid overload or CHF. Layering right pleural effusion is also
slightly increased.
.
EGD/ PATHOLOGY:
[**7-21**] EGD: FINDINGS:
Esophagus:  Protruding Lesions 2 cords of grade III varices and
1 grade II varix were seen in the lower third of the esophagus.
The varices were not bleeding. There were cherry red spots on
the grade II varix. One of the grade III varices extended from
the EG junction to 20cm.
Stomach:  Mucosa: Diffuse granularity and mosaic appearance of
the mucosa with no bleeding were noted in the whole stomach.
Protruding Lesions Non bleeding varices were seen in the fundus.

Duodenum: Mucosa: Mild atrophy of the mucosa was noted in the
second part of the duodenum. Four cold forceps biopsies were
performed for histology at the second part of the duodenum.
Impression:
Varices at the lower third of the esophagus
Varices at the fundus
Granularity and mosaic appearance in the whole stomach
Atrophy in the second part of the duodenum (biopsy)
Otherwise normal EGD to second part of the duodenum
.
[**7-21**] Duodenal mucosal biopsy:  No diagnostic abnormalities
recognized.
.
[**7-22**] EGD: Findings:
Esophagus:  Protruding Lesions 2 cords of grade III varices were
seen starting at 15 cm from the incisors in the lower third of
the esophagus, middle third of the esophagus and upper third of
the esophagus. There were stigmata of recent bleeding. 1 cords
of grade II varices were seen in the lower third of the
esophagus, middle third of t
