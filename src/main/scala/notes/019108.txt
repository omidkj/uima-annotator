Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 10488**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
thrombolysis


History of Present Illness:
68 y/o with severe CAD with acute onset of chest pain and sob.
Pt report that since Monday he has been holding his ASA and
plavix in preparation for an upcoming hernia repair. on monday
he had a mild episode of CP / SOB and briefly resumed ASA /
plavix. Last evening at 730 he became fatigued. He awoke at 3am
with SOB (PND) and chest pain described as substernal presure.
It improved with 2 SL NTG and he reported to sleep. He again
awoke at 7am with SOB. While he was preparing to go to the ED,
he developed [**10-1**] non-radiating substernal pressure and severe
SOB. Also had a pleuritic aspect to the pain. He was profoundly
diaphoretic. Symptoms feel similar to previous cardiac pain. It
was minimally responsive to SL NTG at that time. The patient had
been holding his blood thinners because of an upcoming
procedure.
.
On arrival to the ED VS 96.5, 115/89, HR 60s-70s, 20, 98% 3L.
Shortly after arrival he became hypotensive to 81/51 but was
fluid responsive. CTA chest relieved a saddle PE and heparin gtt
was started. Recieved 3 L IVF. Received zofran 4mg IV and
morphine 2mg IV x 1.

Pertinent Results:
.
Echo [**2198-1-26**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with severe global free
wall hypokinesis. There is appearance of RV apical sparing
([**Last Name (un) 13367**] sign), worrisome for acute pulmonary hypertension
from pulmonary embolism. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle, c/w acute
pulmonary hypertension. Small, underfilled left ventricle with
normal global and regional systolic function.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2196-5-27**], RV
systolic dysfunction is new. Findings discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] at 0950 hours on the day of the study.
.
CTA chest [**2198-1-26**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Saddle embolus involving the bifurcation of the main
pulmonary artery and with extensive clot burden in the left
lung, specifically involving the left lower lobe segmental and
subsegmental arteries. Extensive thrombus is also present in the
ascending and descending portions of the right pulmonary artery.
Scattered bilateral segmental and subsegmental thrombi are
present.
2. Evidence of right heart strain with enlargement of the right
ventricle and loss of the normal right convex configuration of
the interventricular septum.
3. No evidence of pulmonary infarction.
.
[**2198-1-26**] LENIs
IMPRESSION:
No evidence of deep venous thrombosis.
.
CXR [**1-29**]-Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison
to [**1-26**] and 5 chest radiograph. Heart size is normal.
Mediastinal position, contour and width are unremarkable. Lungs
are clear. No new consolidations to suggest interval development
of infection or pulmonary infarct has been demonstrated. No
pneumothorax is seen.
.
EKG [**1-26**] Sinus rhythm. Non-specific intraventricular conduction
delay. Non-specific T wave flattening in the precordial leads.
RSR' pattern in lead V1. Compared to tracing #3 T wave
flattening is new.
