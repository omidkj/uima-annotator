Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Admitted for elective PCI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2152-1-27**] Urgent Two Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(vein
graft to obtuse marginal, vein graft to posterior descending
artery) on IABP
[**2152-1-27**] Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
This is an 81 year old male s/p elective cath at [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital on [**2152-1-20**]. This was done to assess symptoms of
progressive dyspnea in the setting of a known dilated CMP (EF
15-20%) and positive nuclear ETT. The preliminary findings
revealed 85% prox LAD, 80-90% mid RCA stenosis and mild LCx
disease with 60% OM1 lesion. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and
underwent PCI of LAD with cypher stent x2 on [**1-20**]. He returned
today for planned RCA PCI.

His cardiac history dates back to [**2151-2-23**] when he presented
with pneumonia. After completing antibiotics, he had persistent
dyspnea and required an additional admission in [**2151-4-25**]. He was
found to be in CHF. Echo at that time revealed EF 15-20%, LV
cavity dilation, moderate MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] has been followed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] medical management of heart failure. A follow up
nuclear stress test done [**10-29**] revealed mild global hypokinesis
with an EF 33- 40%. Imaging showed moderate inferior wall
infarct with small territory of peri-infarct ischemia.
Clinically, he reports feeling mildly short at breath at both
times during exertion and rest. He is able to complete most
daily activities, but overall feels his energy level has dropped
significantly since having pneumonia in [**Month (only) 958**].

[**2152-2-3**] CXR
1. Improved congestive heart failure.
2. Stable small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than
right.

[**2152-1-31**] ECHO
Poor echo windows. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed - clear regional
assessment could not be performed due to sub-optimal images. No
masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-27**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

[**2152-1-30**] EKG
Sinus rhythm with frequent atrial ectopy. Left axis deviation
with left
anterior fascicular block. Intraventricular conduction defect.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2152-1-29**] no significant diagnostic abnormality.

[**2152-1-27**] Cardiac Catheterization
COMMENTS:
1. The proximal LAD stent is widely open with no angiographic
changes
noted since his last angiogram.
2. The RCA lesion was predilated using 2.0 X 20mm Voyager and
2.5 X 15mm
Voyager balloons, but we were unable to deliver any stent due to
poor
guide support. The procedure was complicated by a mid vessel
dissection
and the patient was referred for urgent CABG. (see PTCA
comments)
3. A 30 CC IABP was positioned with satisfactory diastolic
augmentation.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Patent LAD stent
2. RCA lesion PCI was complicated by vessel dissection -
referred for
urgent CABG.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 65138**] was admitted for an elective PCI of his RCA on
[**2152-1-27**]. Coronary angiography showed a right dominant system with
a widely patent LAD stent, 70% ostial lesion in the obtuse
marginal and severe, diffuse disease of the RCA. Unsuccessful
attempt to open the RCA was made with resultant dissection and
no flow to the distal vessel. No stent was placed in the RCA. He
complained of increasing chest pain but remained hemodynamically
stable. An IABP was placed and he was emergently brought to the
operating room for coronary revascularization. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
performed two vessel coronary artery bypass grafting. The
operation was complicated by bleeding which required multiple
blood products as well as re-exploration. For further details,
see operative note. Following the operation, he was brought to
the CSRU. Over several days, the IABP was weaned and removed
without complication. He was extubated without difficulty and
slowly weaned from inotropic support. Amiodarone was started for
episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Additional units of
PRBCs were transfused to maintain his hematocrit near 30%.
Plavix was resumed for his previous left anterior descending
artery stent. He otherwise maintained stable hemodynamics.
Aspirin, beta blockade and a statin were resumed. All chest
tubes and pacing wire were removed and he transferred to the SDU
on postoperative day five. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight. The physical therapy service was consulted
for assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility.
Ciprofloxacin was started for some mild drainage and erythema of
his leg incisions. Mr. [**Known lastname 65138**] continued to make steady progress
and was discharged home on postoperative day eight. He will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist and his primary
care physician as an outpatient.
