History of Present Illness:
59 yo M with advanced MS, hx of MRSA/VRE, neurogenic bladder,
schizoafffective d/o and hypothyroidism presents with fevers and
tachypnea. Patient was discharged from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on [**10-6**] on a 7
day course of vancomycin after being treated for sepsis and
necrotizing MRSA PNA.  During that admission from [**Date range (1) 104997**]

Pt is nonverbal so hx obtained from notes. On [**10-6**] pt had low
grade fever to 100.9  On [**10-7**] his temperature was noted to be
102.4. WBC was checked and was 22.6 and flagyl was added to his
regimen in addition to his vancomycin. At noon his temperature
spiked to 103.4, his BP was 80/60 and his O2 sat was noted to be
85% on RA and improved to 92% on 5 L NC 02.  He was bolused 500
cc of NS without results and was sent to [**Hospital 882**] Hospital.  At

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 59 yo patient with advanced MS,schizoafffective d/o and
hypothyroidism, recently discharged after tx for necrotizing
MRSA PNA and sepsis who presents with fevers and tachypnea.
.
* Fevers and leukocytosis: Pt presented with high temps and WBC
of 21 with a left shift.  The day PTA he was afebrile and WBC
was 9.  His hypotension suggested early sepsis. Sources for
fever included c.diff (likely with rapid rise in WBC and recent
abx use), recurrent PNA or aspiration (though pt improving on
vanc until [**10-6**] and CXR improved), line infection or wound
infection from skin breakdown (multiple areas of breakdown).
His urine culture was negative and CXR did not show evidence of
new PNA. Sputum showed growth of MRSA and sparse morganella
morgani.  He did have increased ostomy output, but this is an
ileostomy so it was thought that it was less likely this was [**1-19**]
to c.diff.
-started on vancomycin for coverage of MRSA PNA (course to end
on [**10-16**].
-started on flagyl for possible c. diff on [**10-7**]. His c.diff
toxin was negative x3.  C. diff toxin B is still pending.
Flagyl was dc'd on [**10-12**].
-pt was started on ceftazidime for coverage of GNRs and
pseudomonas.  Course should end on [**10-16**].
Patient had a pneumonia form citobacter and a wound infection
with Klebsiela both sensitive to Meropenen.
Patient at this point had finished the course of ALL antibiotics
Wound should be packek we to dry TID

.
*Tachypnea and Hypoxia: Pt desatted to 85% on RA on the day of
admission. Sats improved to 99% on NRB.   He was able to be
transitioned to a face mask. The source for increasing tachypnea
was unclear. Could have been [**1-19**] to increasing secretions,
worsening PNA, or aspiration.  Did not appear overloaded, so did
not this this was the source.  He was continued on a face mask
and did not desat during the rest of his admission.  His CXR
remained stable and he was continued on neb treatments and chest
PT.  He was continued on vancomycin (end date [**10-16**]) for MRSA
and ceftazidime.  He will need a repeat chest CT in 6 months for
f/u.
Patient after GT surgery remained intubated, failure to
extubate. On [**2119-10-19**] underwent tracheostomy:
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Respiratory failure.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Respiratory failure.

PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Open tracheostomy tube placement.

ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.

INDICATION FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 59-year-old
gentleman, with a history of multiple sclerosis, who was
recently admitted with complications and required prolonged
intubation. Due to his persistent need for mechanical
ventilation, we have been asked to place a tracheostomy tube
to protect his vocal cords and to allow for effective
ventilatory weaning and pulmonary care. The patient has had a
prior history of tracheostomy tube placement. Therefore, the
following procedure was performed.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the
operating room, and the procedure was performed open due to
the history of a prior tracheostomy tube. The operation was
performed on the patient's ICU bed. The patient was
positioned supine with his neck extended but head not
floating. I examined his neck and found that the old
tracheostomy scar was overlying the cricoid. The cricoid had
a central defect in it and scarring around it, and it
appeared that the prior tracheostomy had been placed at least
partially through the cricoid. I chose to go for a slightly
inferior incision and place the tracheostomy in the proper
position through the second and third tracheal rings.

We thus made a 2 cm transverse incision approximately 0.5 cm
inferior to the old tracheostomy scar and dissected down
through the platysma. We split the strap muscles and
immediately came upon the cervical trachea. We divided the
isthmus and identified the second and third tracheal rings.
We
