This 79 year old male who is known to cardiac surgery with
critical aortic stenosis, having refused surgical intervention
in the past, s/p valuloplasy x2 [**2132-10-15**]/[**2133-12-15**],
who was transferred from an OSH for acute chest pain with
troponin bump to 4.4. He initially presented to OSH with 1 week
progressive shortness of breath, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea which are distinct from prior shortness of breath
episodes which were attributed to COPD exacerbations and always
accomopanied by cough and wheezing.

stenosis. He now agrres to valve replacement being referred to
cardiac surgery for re-evaluation for an aortic valve
replacement.

ECHO [**2134-4-6**]
The left atrium is elongated. A left-to-right shunt across the
interatrial septum is seen at rest c/w a small secundum atrial
septal defect. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. There are three aortic
valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8
cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**2-15**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation. Mild aortic regurgitation. Increased PCWP. Small
secundum type atrial septal defect.
Compared with the prior study of [**2133-12-12**], the severity of
aortic stenosis and the estimated PA systolic pressure, and
severity of mitral regurgitation are now lower. A small secundum
type ASD is now seen.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The patient has severe aortic valve stenosis. Based on [**2128**]
ACC/AHA Valvular Heart Disease Guidelines, if the patient is
symptomatic (angina, syncope, CHF) and a surgical candidate,
surgical intervention has been shown to improve survival.

CARDIAC CATH [**4-8**]
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this co-dominant system
demonstrated 1 vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA had no
angiographically apparent flow-limiting disease.  The LAD had
30%
stenosis .  The LCx had 50% stenosis of the OM branch.  The RCA
was a
small vessel that was totally occluded at mid-vessel.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated left-sided filling
pressure
with a PCWP of 18mmHg.  There was pulmonary venous hypertension
with a
PA pressure of 42/17mmHg in the setting of an only mildly
elevated PVR.
Cardiac output was decreased at 4.7L/min with an index of
2.6L/min/m2.
3. Selective aortography revealed a calcified aortic root with
no
dilation, patent arch vessels, and patent renal and iliac
arteries with
only mild disease.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated left-sided filling pressures with pulmonary venous
hypertension.
3. Non-dilated and calcified aortic root with patent arch
vessel,
renals, and iliac arteries.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2134-4-5**] for further
management of his chest pain. Heparin was continued and a
cardiac catheterization was obtained which showed single,
non-occlusive coronary artery disease. An echocardiogram showed
severe aortic stenosis with a normal ejection fraction. (Please
see full report for details.) Given the severity of his disease
and the fact that he has had 2 recent failed valvuloplasty's,
the cardiac surgical service was consulted.

 He was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner including a
cartotid duplex ultrasound which showed a <40% stenosis on the
right and a 40-59% stenosis on the left. Pulmonary function
testing was obtained which showed an FEV1 of 1.25L and a
diffusion capacity adjusted for hemoglobin to be 58%. As he had
urinary retention and a worsening renal function
([**2-15**]->1.7->1.2), a renal ultrasound was obtained which was
normal. A nephrology consult was obtained which suspected he
sustained an acute renal injury secondary to to Bactrim. Over
the next few days, his renal function slowly improved.

On [**2134-4-26**], he was taken to the Operating Room where he
underwent an aortic valve replacement using a 19mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**]
tissue prosthesis. Please see operative note for details.
Postoperatively he was taken to the intensive care unit for
monitoring. He was slowly weaned from pressors. On postoperative
day one,
