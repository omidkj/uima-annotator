History of Present Illness:
78 year old female with PMhx dementia, GERD, remote DVT and
remote VA who was admitted with submassive pulmonary embolus.
Patient was in her usual state of health until the evening prior

so severe that she woke up from her sleep. She stated that she
sat in her chair overnight because of the pain. She was

Chest PA/Lateral - IMPRESSION: Prominence of bronchovascular
markings, more on the right, and at the lung bases. Prominence
of vascular markings at the hilum bilaterally. Attenuation at
the right costophrenic angle, and mildly at the left
costophrenic angle.
Findings could suggest congestion, bibasilar atelectasis,
pleural effusion, more on the right, and/or pneumonia especially
at the left lung base. Findings could also be seen in
interstitial lung disease. Please correlate clinically. Old rib
fractures at the left lung base.
Question of a nondisplaced rib fracture at the right mid rib. If
there is a clinical concern, designated rib film could be done
to evaluate this further.
.
CTA chest - IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pulmonary emboli. Large saddle embolus in the right
main
pulmonary artery and segmental left lower lobe branches with
associated
peripheral airspace opacification and small right pleural
effusion. Bowing of the intraventricular septum and increased
ratio of the right to left ventricle suggestive of possible
component of right heart strain.
2. Enlarged heterogenous appearance with multiple nodules noted
in the left thyroid lobe compatible with multinodular goiter.
3. Diffuse ground glass opacity and interlobular thickening
suggestive of
component of congestive heart failure.
4. Moderate in size sliding hiatal hernia.
5. Atherosclerotic disease involving the thoracic aorta.
6. Old left healed rib fractures.
7. 4mm right lower lobe subpleural pulmonary nodule. Recommend
clinical
correlation with risk factors, and if patient is high risk, a
dedicated chest CT can be obtained in 6 months for further
evaluation.
.
Portable chest - FINDINGS: The heart size is normal. Persistent
tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Interval improvement in
interstitial pattern. Small right pleural effusion has possibly
increased in the interval with adjacent atelectasis. Minimal
linear atelectasis at left lung base.
.
CT head - CONCLUSION: Chronic findings unchanged since [**Month (only) **]
[**2154**]. No evidence of hemorrhage.
.
CXR-FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-28**], there is
little overall change. Continued small right pleural effusion
with adjacent atelectasis and minimal streaks of atelectasis at
the left base. Mild prominence of interstitial pattern without
evidence of acute focal pneumonia.
.
ECHO-The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.




Brief Hospital Course:
78 y.o. F with remote CVA, remote DVT, admitted with large
bilateral pulmonary emboli, initially stable on floor but
required ICU stay for hypercarbic respiratory failure

# Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: PCO2 on ABG with hypercarbic
respiratory failure. This was thought to be secondary to
decreased respiratory drive given oxygen supplementation,
possibly underlying COPD. AMS resolved with decreasing O2
supplementation from 3 L NC to 1 L NC. Patient without
documented history of
