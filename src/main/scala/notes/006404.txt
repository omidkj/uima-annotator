Service:  BMT

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 73 year-old
white female who presents as a transfer from [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital for further evaluation and management of acute
leukemia.  The patient states she was in her usual state of
health until one week prior to admission.  At that time she
began to feel a generalized weakness and fluid like symptoms.
After about two to three days of these symptoms she called
her primary care physician who advised her to go to the
hospital. At [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital the patient had a CBC, which
showed pancytopenia.  Further workup included a bone marrow
biopsy, which showed large numbers of blasts cells. The
patient received several red blood cell transfusions and had
intermittent fevers at the outside hospital.  Chest x-ray at
the outside hospital showed possibility of infiltrates so the
patient was started on Rocephin.  CBC on admission at the
outside hospital showed a white blood cell count of 700 and a
hematocrit of 24.  The patient denies fevers or chills,
rigors prior to admission.  She also denies weight loss,
bleeding, easy bruising, headaches or visual changes.

bilaterally.  Skin no rashes.  Antecubital ecchymosis.
Neurological intact.  Cranial nerves II through XII intact.
Motor strength 5 out of 5 throughout.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  CBC shows a white blood cell
count of 1.3, hematocrit 34.8, platelets 39.  Differential on
the white count 31% neutrophils, 2% bands, 47% lymphocytes,
2% atypical cells.  Chemistries were within normal limits.
INR was 1.3.  Liver function tests were within normal limits.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. AML:  The patient's bone marrow
biopsy from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital was reviewed and was consistent
with acute myelogenous leukemia-AML .  The patient was not
started on any immediate treatment for the AML as she was not
symtomatic. Her hematocrit was fairly
stable and though her platelets were low she did not require
any platelet transfusions.  The patient was also started on
Danazol for possible effect of treating her thrombocytopenia.

2.  Infectious disease:  The patient was febrile on admission
as well as neutropenic, therefore she was started on Cefepime
2 grams q 8 for gram negative bacteria coverage.  The patient
also had a chest CT done to evaluate for infectious etiology.
The CT showed patchy infiltrates suggestive of the
possibility of pneumonia as well as some emphysematous
changes.  The patient was started on Levaquin for treatment
of community acquired pneumonia after which she defervesced
and had no further fevers.  The patient had blood cultures
and urine cultures taken during the admission, which were
negative.  Once the patient had been afebrile for over 48
hours the Cefepime was discontinued.  She was maintained on
Levaquin and discharged on Levaquin for a total two week
course.

3.  Cardiovascular:  During the third day of admission the
patient complained of chest discomfort and palpitations.  An
electrocardiogram was done, which showed atrial fibrillation.
Vital signs showed hypotension.  The patient was given .5 mg
of Digoxin intravenous push without significant effect.  She
was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further
management.  In the Intensive Care Unit the patient was
loaded with Amiodarone and started on an Amiodarone drip.
Her vital signs stabilized and the following day she was
electrically cardioverted from atrial fibrillation into a
normal sinus rhythm.  She remained stable in the Intensive
Care Unit after the cardioversion and was then transferred
back to the floor.  The next day after returning to the floor
the patient developed atrial fibrillation once again shown on
telemetry.  At this time she was asymptomatic and her blood
pressure and other vital signs were stable.  Her heart rate
ranged from 100 to 130.  After several hours of atrial
fibrillation the patient's rhythm spontaneously converted
back to normal sinus.  Cardiology was consulted regarding
further management of the patient.  Per cardiology consult
the patient was switched from Amiodarone to Sotalol for
prophylaxis of arrhythmias.  She was initially started on 80
mg t.i.d. of Sotalol.  After one day of monitoring the
patient's electrocardiogram her QT interval corrected
prolonged to approximately 480 milliseconds.  At this time it
was felt that the Sotalol dose should be decreased to avoid
prolongation of her QT interval.  Her dose was decreased to
80 mg b.i.d.  On this her electrocardiograms showed a QTC
interval within normal limits and she was maintained on this
dose.  In addition, while in the Intensive Care Unit the
patient had an echocardiogram, which showed a moderate
pericardial effusion. The etiology of this was unclear, but
possibly to be due to her pneumonia.  A repeat echocardiogram
was done two days after the initial one, which showed that
the pericardial effusion had been reduced in size and was now
small.  The patient never showed any signs or symptoms of
cardiac tamponade.  The patient would be followed up by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 73**] cardiology attending as an outpatient
following discharge.  The patient was not anticoagulated
despite her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation due to the fact
that her platelets remained low below 50 during the admission
secondary to her disease.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient was initially put on
Zantac for history of reflux disease as this was her
outpatient medication. She was switched to Pepcid during the
hospitalization.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good, afebrile, hemodynamically
stable, tolerating po and ambulating without difficulty.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient is to be discharged to home.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was instructed to call
if she developed fevers, chest pain, palpitations.  She was
instructed to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] in the outpatient
clinic in two days.  She was also told that she will follow
up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 73**] of cardiology as an outpatient if
not contact[**Name (NI) **] by Dr.[**Name (NI) 12467**] secretary for an
appointment. She was given the phone number to call and make
an appointment.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  AML.
2.  Atrial fibrillation.
3.  Pneumonia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Levaquin 500 mg once a day for seven days after
discharge.
2.  Sotalol 80 mg twice a day.
3.  Pepcid 20 mg twice a day.
4.  Danazol 200 mg twice a day.
5.  Fosamax continuing outpatient dose.
