CHEST, PA AND LATERAL RADIOGRAPH: There is stable
mild-to-moderate cardiac
enlargement in the patient status post CABG. There has been
interval
resolution of the left lower lobe consolidation and pleural
effusion. There
is a new subtle opacity in the right lower lobe. The soft
tissues are
unremarkable. The marked rightward convex thoracic scoliosis is
again noted.

IMPRESSION:
Right lower lobe pneumonia.

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: *<= 20% (nl >=55%)
TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): *34 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the report of the prior study (tape
not available)
of [**2198-8-13**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size.
Severe global LV
hypokinesis.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Moderate global RV
free wall
hypokinesis.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). Trace
AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular
calcification. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. Mild (1+)
MR. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of MR may be significantly
UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate [2+] TR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Emergency study performed by the cardiology
fellow on call.
Left pleural effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is severe global left
ventricular
hypokinesis. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
moderate
global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly
thickened. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due
to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly
UNDERestimated.] Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is no
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior report (tape unavailable for review) of
[**8-15**], there
has been a marked deterioration of biventricular systolic
function.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.


LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include:
mid
anteroseptal - hypo; basal inferoseptal - hypo; mid inferoseptal
- hypo;
anterior apex - hypo; septal apex - hypo; inferior apex - hypo;
lateral apex -
hypo;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Mildly dilated ascending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Moderately thickened aortic valve leaflets.
Moderate AS.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular
calcification. Mild (1+) MR. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of MR
may be significantly UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR. Mild
PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
Significant PR.

PERICARDIUM: There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat
pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial effusion cannot be
excluded.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Left pleural effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal.
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left ventricular
systolic function
is mildly to moderately depressed. Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities
include mid to distal anteroseptal and apical
hypokinesis/akinesis. The apex
is not fully visualized. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets
are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
