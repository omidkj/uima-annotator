Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement


History of Present Illness:
86 yo female with a history of vascular dementia, HTN, HLD,
recurrent UTIs presents from home with altered mental status and
hypoxia.  The patient was found by her VNA today to be more
confused than normal.  Per her daughter, she can get confused
easily with UTIs.  VNA found her to be hypoxic to the 80s thus
called EMS.

.

In the ED, initial vs were 99.2 84 118/74 40 97% 15.  On exam,
the patient was confused, combative, crackles bilaterally, old
healing superficial lacerations around ankle (concerning for
elder abuse) guaiac positive with vesicles on her rectum.  She
was placed on a non-rebreather with improvement of O2 sat to
96-97% (Pa02 89).  CXR revealed bilateral infiltrates concerning
for pulmonary edema vs. multifocal pneumonia.  Initially the
patient was treated for pulmonary edema with nitroglycerin drip
and lasix 80mg IV.  Her blood pressures dropped to the 90s
systolic.  Labs then returned with non-elevated BNP (although no
prior) so she was treated empirically for hospital associated
pneumonia with vanco/levofloxacin/zosyn.  Her labs were
significant for leukocytosis (with a left shift), hemolyzed
specimen, hyponatremia, normal lactate, normal pH, negative UA,
blood and urine cultures were sent.  Her mental status improved
and oxygen saturation stabilized so the decision was made not to
intubate her at this time.  She received a total of 2L NS.  On
transfer VS 77 116/90 22 99% on NRB.  She is a full code
confirmed by the patient's daughter in the [**Name (NI) **].

.

On the floor,  patient did not complain of any pain. She denied
SOB. She did not want her daughters to leave.

.

Review of systems:  Obtained via daughters who denied sick
contacts although patient spends days at adult day care so could
have been exposed, denies fevers. + for cough over the last
week.

II. Radiology

A. CT Chest
IMPRESSION: Central extensive symmetric consolidation with
associated
traction bronchiectasis and volume loss. The appearance is
suggestive of
cryptogenic organizing pneumonia or chronic eosinophilic
pneumonia, an
infectious etiology is less likely.

B. CXR ([**2129-12-12**])
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-11**], there is
persistent diffuse
bilateral pulmonary opacifications consistent with the CT
appearance of
widespread symmetric consolidations. Moderate enlargement of the
cardiac
silhouette and small left effusion persist.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital course: 86-year-old female with history of vascular
dementia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recurrent UTIs that
presented with altered mental status and hypoxia with imaging
suggesting non-infectious pneumonia with extensive symmetric
consolidation. Hospital course complicated by agitation likely
secondary to hypoxemia with respiratory distress and delirium in
setting of underlying dementia.
.
#Hypoxemic respiratory distress:
Patient had likely multifocal pneumonia on chest CT suggestive
of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia or chronic eosinophilic
pneumonia. Of note, the patient has no home oxygen requirement
and no prior pulmonary issues with prior imaging reviewed with
no apparent pathology related to current episode. She was
treated empirically with a brief course of vancomycin, zosyn
with negative infectious work-up for pulmonary process. She was
also placed on high-dose steroids for ? pulmonary fibrosis
(?cryptogenic organizing pneumonia or chronic eosinophilic
pneumonia) with poor response. In early morning of [**12-12**],
patient agitated with desaturations to low 80s despite maximal
oxygen therapy. Patient eventually became less agitated with
morphine and zydis but may have had component of aspiration and
flash pulmonary edema worsening already poor respiratory status.
After ongoing discussions with family, it was decided to start
her on a morphine drip and focus on comfort. She expired on the
morning of [**2129-12-18**].
.
# Agitation: Patient at baseline with moaning as primary
communication in setting of dementia. Patient had issues with
agitation throughout hospitalization likely given elderly,
dementia at baseline, Russian-speaking, and in unfamiliar
environment with likely some contribution from hypoxemia. She
was continued on aricept and sertraline. In addition to medical
therapy with ativan, zydis, and morphine, attempts made to
frequently re-orient and family visitations.
.
# Goals of care
Given patient's comorbidities and poor response to steroids for
inflammatory pneumonia, family decided to change patient's code
