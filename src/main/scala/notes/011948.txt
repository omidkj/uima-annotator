History of Present Illness:
85 year old woman with history of coronary artery disease s/p
CABG X3 in [**2142**], CHF (ECHO [**11/2143**] w/ EF 30%), NSTEMI, GERD, DVT
s/p IVC filter in [**2138**], hypertension, renal insufficiency,
hyperlipidemia, osteopenia who presents with upper GI bleed. Of
note, the aptient had been at rehab after ruptured thoracic
aortic dissection s/p endovascular repair at [**Hospital1 80463**] on [**2144-6-15**]. The patient developed bright red blood per
rectum at rehab and was sent to [**Hospital **] Hospital where she was
found to be hypotensive SBP89 in ED with Hct 20.9 and WBC 11.5.
CT angio at the time showed increased density in the colon with
edematous duodenal wall and ?ulcerations suggestive of blood.
There was no noted extravasation near the endovascular stent
although the IVC filter was noted to extend beyond the vessel
wall. GI was consulted and the patient started on protonix gtt.
.
The patient received [**2-9**] units pRBC in the ED and then another 2
units in the MICU with appropriate bump. GI performed EGD on
[**2144-6-25**] which showed two large and one smaller duodenal ulcer
without active bleeding. The patient was also found to have
white patches suggestive of esophageal [**Female First Name (un) **]. Of note, the
patient became hypotensive (SBP50s), brady (HR40s), and hypoxic
(O2 sat 60s) shortly after the EGD and had received 50mcg
Fentanyl and 2mg Versed. She responded to Narcan 0.4mg and
Romazicon 0.2mg.
.
On [**2144-6-26**], the patient became thrombocytopenic to 85 and so
subQ heparin was discontnued. Octreotide was started. On [**6-27**],
the patient's Hct continued to remain low at 25 and she received
3 units pRBC. Taggeed RBC scan showed active bleeding in the
proximal duodenum so repeat EGD was performed which showed
active arterial bleeding of the duodenal ulcers which were
clipped, cauterized and injected with epinephrine. The patient,
who had returned to [**Location 213**] sinus, flipped back into atrial
fibrillation with some RVR. The patient continued to pass maroon
stools. The patient was started on two more units pRBC and
MedFlighted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. In total, the
patient reportedly received 11 units pRBC and 6 units platelets,
1 unit FFP, 2.5mg lopressor "around the clock" and octreotide
50mcg/hr gtt, Protonix 8mg/hr gtt. FFP since admission.
.
On transfer the patient's vitals were: afebrile, BP124/80, HR126
AFib, 97% on 2L nasal cannula, RR 15.
.
ROS: Patient resting comfortably in bed, speaks mainly
Cantonese. Daughter and grandaughter at bedside, speak fluent
English. Patient denies discomfort except from NGT and would
like it removed. States breathing, pain, edema not bothersome
right now.

CXR:[**6-28**]
The patient is status post median sternotomy and aortic graft
placement. Nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm, and
right PICC
terminates in the lower SVC. Widening of cardiomediastinal
contours is
present, accompanied by mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
Bilateral pleural effusions are present, small on the right and
small-to-moderate on the left, with improvement on the left
compared to the prior radiograph. A cluster of calcified
granulomas is present in the left upper lobe. A homogeneous
opacity above this level in the region of the left first
anterior rib may reflectconfluence of structures, but attention
to this area on followup radiograph would be helpful to exclude
a pleural or parenchymal abnormality in this region.
.
EKG: Atrial fibrillation with RVR, HR 122, normal axis, normal
intervals, QTc 420, T wave flattening in all leads, generalized
low voltage. Similar to priors although V4-V6 flattening more
pronounced.
