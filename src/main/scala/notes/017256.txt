"typical" migraines associated with nausea, vomiting, and

compliant with her anti-hypertensive medications over the past
week. She denies any fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of
breath, dizziness, abdominal pain, or hematuria. Last dialyzed
yesterday.

Relevant Imaging:
1)Cxray ([**4-27**]): There is stable cardiomegaly with a spade-shaped
configuration and may be seen with pericardial effusion. There
is no new pulmonary vascular congestion. No pleural effusion or
other
evidence of CHF. No focal consolidation is seen. A right-sided
large-bore dual-lumen venous access device terminates in the
high right atrium.

2)CT scan head ([**4-27**]): No evidence of acute bleed.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 76867**] is a 20yo female with PMH significant for MPGN on
HD who presents with hypertensive urgency.

1)Hypertensive urgency: Patient presents with significantly
elevated BPs~200/100's. She has been admitted multiple times to
[**Hospital1 18**] for similar presentation. Usually occurs in the setting of
migraine headaches when she is unable to tolerate PO and unable
to take her blood pressure medications. This is not the case
during this admission. No evidence of significant fluid
overload. She received multiple doses of Labetolol in the ED
with minimal response. No evidence of end organ damage; no ECG
changes, cxray with no pulmonary edema, and CT head with no
evidence of acute bleed. She was started on a nitro gtt in the
ED and upon transfer to the MICU she was also started on a
labetolol gtt as well. The next day her outpatient regimen was
restarted and both the drips were eventually weaned off. She is
being discharged on home regimen which includes Losartan,
Metoprolol, Hydralazine, Clonidine, Isradipine, and Lisinopril.

2)Migraine HA: Patient presents with headaches over the past
week associated with nausea, vomiting, and photophobia. No red
flag symptoms like fevers, chills, etc. Also, usually occurs
before or after HD. Her pain was controlled with Dilaudid.
Headaches resolved at time of discharge.

3)ESRD/MPGN: s/p failed renal transplant with reoccurence of her
disease. Currently on HD; last HD was day prior to admission.
She did not appear volume overloaded on exam. She was dialyzed
once during her stay. Her medications were renally dosed. She
was continued on Mycophenalate and Prednisone. Lasix was
stoppped per renal team recommendations. The patient did not
complete her stress test; it was prematurely stopped given her
extreme hypertension. After discussion with her nephrologist,
the decision was made to postpone the stress test for now.
