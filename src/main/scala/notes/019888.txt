Admission Date:  [**2117-2-1**]     Discharge Date:  [**2117-2-5**]

Date of Birth:   [**2058-5-20**]     Sex:  F

Service:  ICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was admitted for
severe metabolic acidosis and hypotension.  The patient is a
58 year-old woman with a complicated past medical history who
was recently admitted from [**2116-12-4**] to [**2117-1-16**] with multiple graft infections requiring revision.  She
was again admitted on [**1-13**] to [**2117-1-26**] for similar
complaints. On that admission she had a tonic clonic seizure.
Workup included a head CT, which showed multiple
"abnormalities" in the frontal and occipital lobes and
question of metastatic disease versus infarct disease.  An LP
was done on that admission, which was unremarkable.  She was
started on Dilantin.  A transesophageal echocardiogram was
done given her recent history of MRSA bacteremia to rule out
cardioembolic phenomena.  This was negative as was the
carotid ultrasound.  Further management consisted of starting
the patient on aspirin.  All chest x-rays throughout that
admission were negative.  She was discharged to [**Hospital3 **] where staff states she just was not herself.  She was
progressively more lethargic and confused.  On the day of
admission after hemodialysis she was found to be hypotensive.
She was brought to the Emergency Department for further
evaluation.  She was found to be hypotensive in the Emergency
Room with systolics in the 80s.  She was started on Dopamine
and Neo-synephrine was subsequently added on.  She was placed
on Levo and Flagyl and she was intubated and admitted to the
MICU for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Diabetes type 2.
3.  End stage renal disease.
4.  Cerebrovascular disease.
5.  Congestive heart failure.
6.  Peptic ulcer disease.
7.  Peripheral vascular disease.
8.  Hypercholesterolemia.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Protonix.
2.  Aspirin.
3.  Prednisone.
4.  Multivitamin.
5.  Zocor.
6.  Dilantin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Blood pressure 107/67.
Heart rate of 96.  Respirations 24.  She was intubated on
examination.  The patient was sedated and on the vent.
Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.  Her
endotracheal tube was in place.  Her neck was supple.
Cardiac examination demonstrated normal S1 and S2 with no
murmurs.  Chest was clear anteriorly.  Abdomen she had absent
bowel sounds, firm.  Extremities were cool throughout. Her
distal pulses were not palpable in the lower extremities. She
had dopplerable femoral pulses.  She had a necrotic right
second digit.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count was 16.0
with 92% neutrophils, 5.2 lymphocytes and 0 basophils.  Her
hematocrit was 26.8, platelets were 111.  INR 1.3.  Chem 7
showed a sodium of 146, potassium 3.2, chloride 102, bicarb
20, BUN 24, creatinine 2.9 and glucose of 256.  She had a
lactate of 19.  Her electrocardiogram showed sinus
tachycardia at 110 beats per minute with a normal axis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a 58 year-old woman with
multiple medical problems including three vessel coronary
artery disease, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, severe
peripheral vascular disease complicated by multiple
cerebrovascular accidents and multiple lower extremity
bypasses now being admitted in presumed septic shock after
dialysis treatment on the morning of admission.  In terms of
the patient's shock she was treated according to the Must
protocol.  She got aggressive blood pressure support
including intravenous fluids.  She was on Vasopressin and
Levophed.  Broad spectrum antibiotics were started including
Vancomycin, Gentamycin and Flagyl.  Her central venous
pressure was monitored.  She received blood transfusion to
keep her hematocrit above 30.  In terms of the coffee ground
emesis that was found in the Emergency Room she was started
on intravenous Protonix.  Surgery was asked to follow her for
this reason as well as her severe peripheral vascular
disease.  The Vascular Surgery team saw the patient and felt
that her lower extremity graft that she had recently had
revised had most likely clotted.  The General Surgery team
saw the patient and felt that she was most likely
experiencing ischemic bowel, but given her comorbidities no
surgical intervention was indicated.  As per the patient's
family and a long discussion with the attending the patient
was made DNR/DNI.

Over the next couple of days of the patient's admission she
continued to show little signs of improvement.  She remained
on two pressors for blood pressure support.  Her pressure
would drop precipitously if one pressor was removed.  her
mental status remained very poor, very sedated and lethargic
without any pharmacological sedation.  Given the poor
prognosis of the patient and prolonged discussion with the
family the patient was made comfort measures only and all
pressors were withdrawn from the patient.  The patient died
on hospital day five at 11:10 p.m. at night.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Sepsis.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Not applicable.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  Not applicable.
