Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
cough, shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
22 year old male w/questionable asthma history, hiatal hernia,
and allergies presenting with 2 days of increasing cough,
congestion, with progressive SOB. The patient has a questionable
history of asthma and was prescribed a albuterol inhaler last
year. He has been using the albuterol inhaler multiple times a
week both during the day and at night. His shortness of breath
is exacerbated by exertion and sometimes food intake. It
improves with albuterol and sometimes laying flat. His shortness
of breath is sometimes associated with a chest pressure which
the patient describes as "my chest is going to explode." For the
last 2 days the patient has experienced the new symptoms of
productive cough and sharp non-radiating substernal chest pain
which is exacerbated by deep inspiration and cough. The patient
denies recent travel but has been in contact with [**Name2 (NI) **] contacts
at work who have the flu. He has not received his flu vaccine
this year.The patient denies frank chest pain, palpitations,
dysuria, fevers, arthralgias.
.
The patient says he saw a doctor in the past who diagnosed him
with cat, pollen allergy with "blood tests." He feels nasally
congested all year long and has suffered from "bronchitis" in
the past with at least 1 episode of pneumonia in the last 5
years.
.
He also has been experiencing intermittent watery diarrhea for
years and lower abdominal cramping pain which wakes him up from
sleep in the morning hours. He denies any hematochezia, melena.
He denies nausea and vomiting, weight loss.
.
Upon presentation to the ED vitals were: T 97.4, HR 126, BP
142/86, RR 22, O2Sat 96% RA. The patient was also complaining of
chest pain in the E.D. A D-dimer and cardiac enzymes were
negative. Chest X ray did not show any acute pulmonary process.
He received nebulizers without much effect. He was desaturating
into the 89-92% range on RA and exertion. However his
oxygenation normalized with supplemental oxygen with a venturi
mask. The patient received Combivent X3, Solumedrol 125mg IV for
his respiratory distress and Toradol, Ativan for anxiety and
abdominal pain. He denies nausea and vomiting, diarrhea. Peak
flow was 200cc initially in E.D.
.
Prior to transfer to the floor vitals were: afebrile, HR 141, BP
159/115, RR 20, O2Sat 98% venturi 50%.

Imaging:
[**2152-10-23**] CXR: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
.
[**2152-10-24**] CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is
no relevant
change. Normal size of the cardiac silhouette. Normal appearance
of the
hilar and mediastinal structures. No pleural effusions. No
pneumothorax.
Normal appearance of the lung parenchyma, no acute pulmonary
changes.
.
[**2152-10-24**] CTA Chest:
1. Multifocal geographic ground-glass opacities throughout both
lungs, the
appearance is suggestive of foreign substance inhalation,
although with an
appropriate clinical history, aspiration, hemorrhage and viral
pneumonia are also considered possible.
2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
.
[**2152-10-25**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. RSR' pattern in lead V1. Since
the previous tracing of [**2152-10-23**] the rate is slower. ST-T wave
abnormalities are less prominent. RSR' pattern in leads V1-V2 is
not seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
22yo male with h/o hiatal hernia, allergies, and asthma who
initially presented with two days of increasing cough and
shortness of breath, likely secondary to acute on chronic asthma
exacerbation in setting of infectious process.
.
#. Asthma Exacerbation: Patient initially treated in the MICU
for presumed asthma exacerbation with nebulizers and steroids.
Exacerbation likely secondary to either viral or atypical
pneumonia, based on CT chest findings.  CTA was done given
hypoxia and respiratory distress; did not show evidence of PE
but did show findings concerning for left mid-lower lung
pneumonia, for which he was started on ceftriaxone and
azithromycin. Of note, urine legionella antigen negative, HIV
antibody and viral load negative, and respiratory vir
