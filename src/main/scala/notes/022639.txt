Pertinent imaging studies in hospital

[**2149-8-21**] CARDIAC CATH:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with severe three vessel disease. The LMCA had a 40%
stenosis. The LAD showed a mid 80% stenosis. There was a
significant Ramus intermedius which bifurcated and had 60%
stenoses in both parts after bifurcation. The RCX had diffuse
disease and the OM1 had a 80% stenosis. The RCA was diffusely
diseased with an occlusion in its mid portion.
2. Selective vein grafts angiography was not performed since the
SVG-OM and SVG-Ramus grafts are known to be occluded.
3. Selective arterial conduit angiography showed a patent
LIMA-LAD graft without flow limiting stenoses.
4. Limited resting hemodynamics reveald mild pulmonary
hypertension (PA mean 28 mmHg). The right sided filling
pressures were mildly elevated (RA mean 14 mmHg, RVEDP 15 mmHg).
The left sided filling pressures were mildly elevated (PCWP 20
mmHg). Cardiac output was normal (CO 5.3 L/min, CI 2.5
L/min/m2).

No intervention performed given diffuse disease.

---------------
[**2149-8-27**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). A bioprosthetic
aortic valve prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is
normal for this prosthesis. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

Compared with the prior study (tape unavailable) of [**2147-8-30**]
there is an
improvement in left ventricular systolic function.

---------------
[**8-22**] CT ABDOMEN:
1) No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma or hematoma in the
thigh.
2) Comminuted left intertrochanteric fracture.

---------------
[**2149-8-22**] V/Q SCAN: Ventilation images obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m
aerosol in 6 views demonstrate moderate heterogeneous tracer
uptake, particularly in the left lung.

Perfusion images in the same 6 views show mildly heterogeneous
perfusion in a
similar pattern to that seen in the ventilation study. No
ventilation/perfusion
mismatches seen.

Portable chest x-ray performed early this morning reportedly
showed no infiltrates or consolidation within the lung fields.

The above findings are consistent with a low likelihood of
pulmonary embolism.

---------------
Chest X-rays:
[**2149-8-23**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Mild CHF

[**2149-8-23**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Mild degree of partial
atelectasis involving the lower lobes. Removal of the ET tube
and the NG tube are noted with no evidence of pneumothorax or
pleural effusion.

[**2149-8-24**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Partial withdrawal of
the right subclavian line. No other significant changes are
noted.

[**2149-8-24**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP): The right subclavian
line remains in place. The tip is in the right atrium. The
appearance of the lung fields has not changed since the prior
study. There are no areas of active congestion, or infiltration.
Some calcified bilateral hilar nodes and some calcified
granulomatas in the left upper lobe are noted. There is no
evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly and
post-operative changes are again noted.

[**2149-8-26**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP): No acute cardiopulmonary
abnormality.

[**2149-8-29**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Compared to the previous
study of [**8-27**] there is improvement in the CHF.

[**2149-9-1**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Improving CHF.
