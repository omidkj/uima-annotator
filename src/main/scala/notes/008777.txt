Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 66 year old male with
a history of metastatic parotid cancer, coronary artery
disease, diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension who
presented to the Emergency Department with the complaint of
seven days of fever, lethargy, myalgias and decreased p.o.
intake.  Initially, the patient contact[**Name (NI) **] his primary care
physician two days prior to admission complaining of feeling
"achy and stiff", for five days.  He also reported
temperatures to 100.0 F., and a mild productive cough ([**Doctor Last Name 352**]
sputum).

In the Emergency Department, the patient complained of the
above symptoms as well as two days of chest tightness which
was intermittent that had been associated with diaphoresis.
EKG was unchanged.  The patient was noted to be hypertensive
to 207/111, which was not responsive to p.o. Lopressor, p.o.
Captopril and an Isamine drips.  Finally, the patient's blood
pressure decreased to approximately 160/80 with a Nipride
drip.  The patient developed agitation in the Emergency
Department and was also noted to be febrile to 103.2 F., with
rigors.  The patient was given Ceftriaxone 2 grams
intravenously times one.  He also had a CT scan of the chest,
abdomen and head in the Emergency Department.

Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was agitated, moaning
and appeared uncomfortable and a lumbar puncture was
performed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Diabetes mellitus type 2 with a hemoglobin A1C of 6.7 in
[**2171-2-15**].
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Coronary artery disease with a history of inferior
myocardial infarction treated with TPA in [**2162**].  The patient
had a negative exercise treadmill test in [**2168**].
5.  Right adenoid cystic carcinoma of the parotid gland
status post resection without clear margins in [**2159**]; status
post XRT in [**2159**]; status post recurrence in the scalp treated
with XRT in [**2162**] with a residual right facial nerve palsy;
likely recurrence in the skull in [**2167**] with no further
treatment due to the tumor being considered quite indolent.
6.  Repair of macular hole.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q. day.
3.  Metformin 1000 mg p.o. twice a day.
4.  Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. twice a day.
5.  Sandostatin 20 mg p.o. q. day.
6.  Aspirin.
7.  Vitamin D.

ALLERGIES:   The patient had no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   Tobacco, 40 plus pack year history, quit in
[**2162**].  Occasional alcohol use; no drugs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, temperature was 99.9
F.; blood pressure 190/76; heart rate of 24; respiratory rate
of 20; oxygen saturation of 95% on two liters.  In general,
he was moaning, ill-appearing, and in moderate distress.
HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round and reactive to light.
Extraocular muscles are intact.  There was a right facial
droop which is chronic and a purulent discharge from the
right ear.  Mucous membranes were dry.  Neck:  There was
nuchal rigidity.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, tachycardic, with
a soft systolic murmur.  Lungs:  Tachypneic.  Clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.  Extremities warm with
no edema.  Rectal:  Guaiac negative per Emergency Department
staff.  Neurological:  Moving all extremities.

LABORATORY:  On admission, white blood cell count was 16.5
with 89% neutrophils, 6% lymphocytes.  Hematocrit was 40.8,
platelets 274.

Chem-7 was 139, 4.2, 96, 23, 24, 1.0, 359.  A toxicology
screen was negative.

Chest x-ray was within normal limits.  A head CT scan showed
no evidence of mass or bleed but did show a defect in the
calvarium consistent with a metastatic focus.

EKG was unchanged from prior.

A swab of the ear discharge showed two plus neutrophils and
four plus Gram positive cocci in pairs, chains and clusters.

Cerebrospinal fluid study showed a protein of 802, glucose of
20.  In tube one there were 4,000 white cells and [**Pager number **] red
cells.  In tube number four, there were 21,700 white cells
and [**Pager number **] red cells.  The differential on this was 81
neutrophils and 10 lymphocytes.

An arterial blood gas done on admission was 7.42/39/99 on
four liters.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit Service for bacterial meningitis.  He was
started on empiric therapy with Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin and
Vancomycin.  Multiple cultures were drawn and the Infectious
Disease Service was consulted.  At the time of admission, the
patient had marked hypertension and continued to require the
Nipride drip.

Due to progressive hypoxia and tachypnea, the patient was
intubated and placed on the mechanical ventilator.

The patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled.  His CK rose
slightly and he had a troponin leak which peaked at 9.9.  As
this was felt to be a demand event (and the patient had an
unexplained hematocrit drop), the patient was not
heparinized.  He was continued on aspirin, beta blocker and
Simvastatin.

The following day, the patient underwent repeat head CT scan
with contrast to evaluate for possible abscess or a sinus
tract connecting with the cerebrospinal fluid (likely through
the metastatic focus near the right ear).  This CT scan
showed the developed of new hydrocephalus and possible
impending herniation.  It also showed blood or pus in the
posterior occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricles.
Following this finding, a Neurosurgery consultation was
obtained and a ventricular drain was placed.  The patient's
Ceftriaxone was also changed to Ceftazidine on [**4-22**], per
the Infectious Disease consultants recommendations.

On the morning of [**4-23**], the patient was noted to have a
labile blood pressure, quickly cycling between systolics of
140 and 205.  On examination, he was unresponsive, despite
being off sedation for eight to ten hours.  Pupils were
sluggishly reactive and he had an abnormal oculocephalic
reflex.

Given all these signs of brain dysfunction, a meeting was
held with the patient's family to discuss prognosis and
possible course of action.  The family decided that they
wanted no further interventions and that they wanted further
treatment to be focused on comfort measures only.  Therefore,
all medications except for morphine and Ativan were
discontinued.  The patient was extubated and maintained on
morphine and Ativan titrated to comfort.

The patient passed away at 10 p.m. on [**2171-4-23**].

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Deceased.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Fulminant bacterial meningitis.
