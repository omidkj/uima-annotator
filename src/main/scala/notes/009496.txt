Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Mild shortness of breath. Right atrial mass noted on ECHO.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1)Redo sternotomy 2)Excision of right atrial mass


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 2026**] is a 44-year-old gentleman who underwent an atrial
septal defect repair as well as MAZE procedure approximately 2
years ago. The patient subsequently had an echocardiogram which
demonstrated a polypoid mass in his right atrium that was quite
large(2x3 centimeters). He also had findings of pulmonary
nodules on chest x-ray that was confirmed by outside CT scan.
There was no contraindication for surgery so the patient was
therefore referred for removal of the mass.

Prior to admission, he did complain of mild shortness of breath
and increasing fatigue. He denied any further cardiac or
respiratory complaints. Given the potential for atrial thrombus,
he had been placed on Warfarin.

s/p ASD and MAZE procedure, History of PAF, Left lung nodules,
Elevated cholesterol, GERD

Social History:
Current smoker - admits to 1 PPD. He denies ETOH over the last

Brief Hospital Course:
After a thorough preoperative evaluation which included dental
clearance and chest CT scan to evaluate known lung nodules, he
was cleared for surgery. On [**5-12**], Mr. [**Known lastname 2026**] was admitted
and taken to the operating room where a redo sternotomy was
performed along with excision of right atrial mass. The right
atrial mass was sent to pathology. His operative course was
uneventful. Following the operation, he was brought to the CSRU.
There he was extubated and weaned from sedation. He awoke
neurologically intact. Most of his preoperative medications were
resumed and he transferred to the floor on postoperative day
one. He maintained good hemodynamics and was gently diuresed
toward his preoperative weight. Because he remained in a normal
sinus rhythm, Warfarin was not resumed per cardiology
recommendations. He required Motrin for adequate pain
management. Prior to discharge, final pathology of the right
atrial mass is still pending.
