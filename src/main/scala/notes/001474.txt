Admission Date:  [**2123-3-22**]     Discharge Date:  [**2123-3-26**]

Date of Birth:  [**2044-11-16**]      Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Biventricular implantable
cardioverter-defibrillator/pacemaker placement.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 78-year-old male with
multiple medical problems including recurrent arrhythmia,
coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure with
ejection fraction of 30% who was referred by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
for APF/LV mapping/biventricular ICD.  He was scheduled for
the pacemaker ICD placement in effort to enhance synchrony of
his cardiac function and to capture an element of atrial
kick, as well.

He had the procedure done on [**2123-3-23**] which was complicated
by approximately 400 cc blood loss and hypotension which
ultimately responded to fluid boluses and Dopamine drip.  He
was noted to have a drop in hematocrit and, in light of
hypotension, he was monitored in the CCU after his procedure.
In the holding area a quick TTE was done showing no effusion.
Initially he had been monitored on the floor, but blood
pressures were 60s/30s despite Dopamine.  His hematocrit
trended from mid 30s to 27.4, and he was started on one unit
packed red cells and admitted to the CCU.  He denied back
pain, groin pain, chest pain, shortness of breath.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post myocardial
infarction.
2.  Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 30%.
3.  Cardiotoxicity and cardiomyopathy status post Adriamycin.
4.  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of retroperitoneal space status
post chemo complicated by cardiotoxicity.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia/hypertension.
6.  Antithrombin 3 deficiency complicated by deep venous
thrombosis.
7.  Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair 10/[**2119**].
8.  Alternating right bundle branch block/left anterior
fascicular block with left bundle branch block and long PR.
9.  Cellulitis complicated by group A Streptococcal
bacteremia [**11/2122**] status post Vancomycin times one month.
10. Hypothyroidism.
11. Clostridium difficile complicated by toxic megacolon
status post hemicolectomy.
12. Right groin pseudo aneurysm.
13. Status post transient ischemic attack.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER TO CCU:
1.  Lipitor 10 mg a day.
2.  Lasix 80 mg a day.
3.  Plavix 75 mg a day.
4.  Synthroid 25 mcg a day.
5.  Diovan 40 mg a day.
6.  Aldactone 25 mg a day.
7.  Digoxin 0.125 mg a day.

ALLERGIES:
1.  Penicillin.
2.  Keflex.
3.  Clindamycin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  In general, somnolent but
arousable.  Vitals:  Temperature 97.7, blood pressure 114/80
on 5 mcg of Dopamine, pulse 92, 98% on 4 liters nasal
cannula.  HEENT:  Pupils equally round, reactive to light
bilaterally; oropharynx clear.  Heart:  Regular rate, tachy,
II/VI systolic murmur at the left sternal border.  Pulmonary:
Bibasilar rales up to halfway up.  Abdomen:  Normoactive
bowel sounds; soft, nontender, nondistended; guaiac negative.
Extremities:  Trace bilateral pitting edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  Significant for hematocrit 34 dropping to
30 dropping to 27.4 on admission.  Creatinine of 1.4, INR of
1.4.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular rhythm:  Patient was ventricular paced
with ICD which was interrogated the day after placement and
working well.  Electrophysiology adjusted parameters and
turned down single output as was pacing diaphragm.  He
completed a five-dose course of Vancomycin as well as a day
of Levofloxacin per Electrophysiology given the extent of the
procedure for prophylaxis.

2.  Ischemia:  Patient had no signs or symptoms of active
ischemia.  He was continued on his home regimen of statin,
Plavix, and Valsartan.

3.  Blood pressure:  Patient had hypovolemia likely secondary
to blood/volume loss and was transfused two units packed red
cells initially.  He was gradually weaned off Dopamine after
a day and his blood pressure stabilized.  He had the rest of
his home cardiac meds added, including Lasix for diuresis.

4.  Congestive heart failure:  Patient was aggressively
diuresed with intravenous Lasix after his blood pressure
normalized given his chest x-ray is concerning for congestive
heart failure.  He diuresed well and weaned off oxygen.
Chest x-ray repeated after diuresis showed improvement with
decrease in infiltrates bilaterally.

Patient will continue on Digoxin, Lasix, and Spironolactone
per home meds.  These were started also during admission.

5.  Left lower extremity deep venous
thrombosis/hypercoagulability:  He will be started on Lovenox
and Coumadin to be followed by primary care physician.

6.  Hypothyroidism:  Continued on Synthroid.

7.  Prophylaxis:  INR still subtherapeutic but on Lovenox.

8.  Rash/pruritus:  Patient complained of generalized
pruritus.  Nurse noticed raised area of erythema diffusely
across back which decreased with hydrocortisone cream.  A
Dermatology consult was called which recommended topical
treatments including Sarna lotion and Lac-Hydrin.  He should
also use Spectazole to feet twice daily for tinea pedis.  At
home he will continue on Atarax p.r.n.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISPOSITION:  To home.
