Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
Lower GI Bleed


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Blood transfusion
2. Interventional radiology tagged red blood cell scan with
attempted percutaneous ablation.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79 y/o male with a history of atrial
fibrillation on coumadin, CKD stage III, COPD, chronic
venostasis, systolic CHF (EF of 45%-50%) who presented to [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] with several episodes of bright red blood per rectum. He
first noted some bleeding while he was on vacation in
[**State 2748**] the day PTA. He started having some abdominal
discomfort overnight and went to the bathroom where he had an
episode of bright red blood per rectum. Later on the following
day he had multiple other episodes of BRBPR and decided to
return to [**State 350**] and presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**]. At [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**], in the ED he was noted to be pale and having massive
bright red blood per rectum. His hematocrit was noted to be 41
upon presentation which dropped to 27.5 approximately 6 hours
later. His INR was 3.2 and his creatinine was 1.7. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and IR intervention.
He received 2 units of FFP and 1 unit of packed red blood cells
prior to discharge.
.
Of note he presented in [**Month (only) **] to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] with a similar
episode of lower GI bleed. He had a colonsocpy on [**2175-11-18**] which
showed persistent active bleeding with diffuse clots suggestive
of diverticular bleed in the setting of anticoagulation with
coumadin and was transferred to the intensive care unit. The
patient's INR was reversed with FFP and he also received vitamin
K.  He also required blood transfusion. He received a total of 4
units of packed red blood cells and 8 units of FFP.
.
On arrival to the MICU, paient was noted to be awake and alert.
His vitals were stable on arrival and he was mentating well.
Ultrasound of his internal jugular showed collapse suggestive of
volume depletion. There was an emergency release of 3 units of
packed red blood cells and 2 untis of FFP.

Brief Hospital Course:
79 year-old male with atrial fibrillation on coumadin, chronic
kidney disease, 5 months s/p massive lower GI bleed secondary to
diverticular disease transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for massive
lower gastrointestinal bleed most likely due to sigmoid
diverticulosis.

Issues addressed during hospitalization:
1. Acute blood loss anemia
2  Diverticular bleeding
3. Chronic systolic heart failure with EF 45%.
4. Hypertension
5. Atrial Fibrillation s/p PPM

   The patient presented to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] after
experiencing a large lower GI bleed while gambling at a casino
in [**Location (un) **]. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**], the patient stepped
out of the car and his pants were soaked with blood. He was
transfused 4 units of packed red blood cells as well 3 units of
FFP and vitamin K for an INR of 3.2. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for possible surgical or interventional radiology intervention.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he continued to have painless rectal
bleeding. The patient was admitted to the ICU where he received
3 additional units of red blood cells. Surgical and GI services
were consulted who recommended a tagged RBC scan which was
notable for extravasation in the sigmoid. IR attempted to
percutaneously embolize the bleed, but could not find any
bleeding during the procedure. The procedure was then aborted.
He received 3 more units of red cells to maintain a hematocrit
greater than 30. Of note, despite the recurrent bleeding he did
not have any hemodynamic instability.

      His bleeding ceased without intervention by hospital day 2
and his hematocrit remained stable for 4 consecutive days. On
hospital day 3, his metoprolol and lasix were resumed and his
blood pressure remained stable. The patient never had any
episodes of shortness of breath, chest pain, or reported
palpitations.

      Prior to discharge, an discussion was held with GI, the
patient's primary care physician (Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**
