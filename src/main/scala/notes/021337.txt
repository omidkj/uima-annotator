Blood cx: [**4-26**] pending

MRSA screen: [**4-26**] negative

Studies:
EKG
Sinus tachycardia. Possible left atrial abnormality. Poor R wave
progression. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2165-3-27**] the ST-T wave changes are more
pronounced and the sinus tachycardia is new. The QRS change in
lead V3 could be positional.

CXR
[**2167-4-28**]
IMPRESSION: Left upper lung opacification which likely
represents fissural
fluid versus consolidation/infection. Recommend conventional PA
and lateral for further evaluation.

CT abd/pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1. The findings most likely represent acute appendicitis with
secondary cecal colitis and partial small bowel obstruction,
however a primary cecal
inflammatory process causing secondary appendix changes is
another diagnostic consideration.
2. Minimal peribronchovascular opacity at left lung base may be
infectious or inflammatory.


Brief Hospital Course:
58 yo m with hx of CAD, was admitted with sever abdominal pain
in RLQ and distension, concerning for appy with possible
perforation  vs inflammation. He was  medically managed during
this hospitalization.

For his acute appendicitis with possible rupture, he was treated
conservatively with IV abx. He did not undergo surgery during
this admission. He was treated with IV ciprofloxacin and flagyl
throughout the hospital course. Antibiotics were discontinued
prior to discharge.

An NG tube was placed while he was distended and not passing
anything per rectum. It was left in place for several days. IVF

tube was discontinued and his diet was gradually advanced. He
