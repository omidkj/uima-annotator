Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine / Keppra

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4057**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ridig bronchoscopy with stent placement then stent removal

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 63 year-old man PMH follicular/variant
papillary thyroid CA s/p total thyroidectomy and radical neck
dissection in [**2156**] along with radioactive iodine as recently as
[**2167**], surveillance
scanning revealing pulmonary nodules and hilar lymphadenopathy
in [**2168-2-9**] with subsequent PET-CT demonstrating FDG-avidity to
these areas as well as to bone.
.
Since that time, he was additionally found to have cranial
metastases found to be thyroid CA mets at craniotomy, and other
scattered bone mets including, among others, thoracic and lumbar
vertebrae. He [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] cranial and bone XRT as well as
chemotherapy with at first sorafenib then Sutent after
progression of disease. Sutent was most recently stopped in [**Month (only) **]
[**2171**] after he developed a peri-met intraparenchymal hemorrhage.

.
He presented to clinic on [**2171-10-23**] complaining of shortness of
breath and wheezing with a saturation of 94% on room air. He
received CTA for PE and ruled out MI, but did not want to be
admitted for workup and left ED AMA.
.
He re-presented on [**11-4**], with progressive dyspnea at rest and
wheezing and subjective fevers. CXR suggested possible post
obstructive pna so he was placed on levaquin and flagyl. He felt
well but kept desatting. IP consulted who felt he had a
post-obstructive collapse on the left side and planned to
bronch.
.
On [**2171-11-9**], he [**Date Range 1834**] flexible and rigid bronchoscopy which
revealed a near-complete obstruction of the left mainstem
bronchus endobronchial lesion with near complete obstruction of
the airway. Epinephrine 1:10,000 applied followed by argon
plasma coagulation done, followed by coring out and excision of
the tumor. Left mainstem patency was restored, only 15% residual
obstruction remained. The LUL and LLL showed near complete
obstruction, So mechanical debridement and argon plasma
coagulation done to the distal left mainstem and LUL and LLL
bronchi with only mild improvement of the patency. Balloon
dilatation to 12mm was done followed by deployment of a 12mm x
40mm after LMS dimensions measured. Balloon dilation within the
stent also done.
.
The patient was transferred to PACU post-procedurally and was
subsequently extubated. Shortly thereafter, he developed
desaturations, respiratory distress, and tachypnea. He was
subsequently re-intubated. CXR showed complete opacification of
the left hemithorax. Bronchoscopy was performed again, and an
occlusive mucuous plug of the left mainstem stent site was
removed. He remained intubated post-procedure.  The stent had
evidence of migration, and was subsequently removed on [**11-10**].
His MICU [**Last Name (un) **] was also complicated by coffee ground emesis; EGD
preformed did not demonstrate any lesions, and the finding was
likely secondary to digested blood from the procedure.  He was
successfully extubated on [**11-10**] but was delerious overnight.  His
Decadron was tapered from 4mg q8 to 4mg q12 on [**11-11**].  On arrival
to the floor he states that he has a slight cough with white
sputum since extubation, but is AOx3 and otherwise feeling well.

.
ROS: denies fever, chills, weight change, headache, shortness of
breath, wheezing, chest pain or tightness, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation, melena, BRBPR, focal weakness, rash.
Complete ROS was otherwise negative.


Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Mr. [**Known lastname 76117**] is a 63-year-old gentleman with
thyroid carcinoma. In [**2156**], he noted a lump in the right side of
his neck.  He was found to have thyroid carcinoma and [**Year (4 digits) 1834**]
a
total thyroidectomy with right radical neck dissection. 20 lymph
nodes were positive. Pathology was consistent with follicular
versus follicular variant of papillary carcinoma. Per his
report,
he was not treated with radioactive iodine at that time but
after
a few years, when his thyroglobulin level increased, he received
several courses of radioactive iodine. His last course of
radioactive iodine was in 9/[**2167**]. CT in [**11/2167**] showed no
recurrent or residual tumor, but there were small scattered
pulmonary nodules. In [**2-/2168**], a neck ultrasound was notable for
right posterior triangle lymph nodes. CT chest on [**2168-2-23**] showed
multiple pulmonary nodules and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.
PET scan on [**2168-3-15**] confirmed FDG avid right hilar lymph nodes,
numerous pulmonary nodules, and a lucency in L5 concerning for
metastasis. He was asymptomatic and the decision was made to
follow him until he became symptomatic. CT chest in [**7-/2168**]
showed
a slight increase in his pulmonary nodules, along with
mediastinal and right hilar lymph node enlargement. In [**9-/2168**],
he
developed headaches and diplopia in his right eye. Brain MRI on
[**2168-9-19**] showed a large spongy-appearing lesion on the
posterior
fossa within the calvarium. PET scan of the brain on [**2168-9-21**]
showed a lytic mass lesion involving the suboccipital skull,
centered to the right of midline. Mr. [**Known lastname 76117**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**]
craniotomy on [**2168-10-14**]. Pathology was consistent with metastatic
thyroid carcinoma. He completed radiation therapy to his skull
on
[**2168-12-21**] (total dose of 5000cGy) but then developed low back
pain. MRI L spine on [**2168-12-12**] revealed bony metastatic disease
most prominent at L1 with extension into the left epidural
space.
Additional metastatic foci were seen at the L4 vertebral body
and
left T12 transverse process, pedicle and lamina. He started
radiation therapy from T12 to S1 on [**2168-12-26**] and completed it on
[**2169-1-13**]. He began sorafenib on [**2169-1-23**] and had a significant
radiographic response in his parenchymal disease, but his
osseous
metastases did not respond as well. His sphenoid metastasis was
treated with palliative fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy,
2400 cGy in 3 fractions, completed on [**2169-8-8**]. He also
[**Year (4 digits) 1834**] standard EBXRT to his right pubic bone
metastasis, performed with his local radiation oncologist and
completed in late [**Month (only) **]/early [**2169-11-9**]. He progressed
through sorafenib in [**3-/2170**] and developed a metastasis in his
right glenoid cavity for which he [**Year (4 digits) 1834**] radiation.  He
completed radiation around [**2170-5-28**] and stopped sorafenib shortly
thereafter. He then started sunitinib on [**2170-6-11**] at a dose of
50mg
PO daily x 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks off, until [**2171-7-23**] when
he presented with an intraparenchymal hemorrhage due to a right
parietal mass. Sunitinib was stopped and he [**Month/Day/Year 1834**] right
craniotomy for resection of the right parietal mass on [**2171-7-26**].
He then completed Cyberknife - 2400 cGy in 3 fractions - on
[**2171-8-26**]. He had progression of his disease but declined further
chemotherapy.
