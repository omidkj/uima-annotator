[**2196-9-28**] CXR
In the interim, the patient has been extubated and Swan-Ganz
catheter has been removed. There is no pneumothorax. Mediastinal
drain and left-sided chest tube are in stable position. NG tube
has been removed. There is bibasilar atelectasis and small
pleural effusions, with an enlarged heart but no evidence of
cardiac failure.

[**2196-9-27**] EKG
Sinus rhythm
ST segment elevation in leads V2-V4 - probably repolarization
but consider
pericarditis

[**2196-9-23**] ECHO
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%).
2. The aortic root is moderately dilated.
3. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.

[**2196-9-24**] CTA Chest
1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Mild dilatation of the aortic root.
3. Dense coronary artery calcifications as above.
4. Cholelithiasis and suggestion of a porcelain gallbladder.
Further followup is recommended given the increased incidence of
gallbladder carcinoma in these patients.




Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2196-10-23**] via transfer from
the [**Hospital6 3872**] for further management of his
coronary artery disease. He was worked-up in the usual
preoperative manner by the cardiac surgical service. A CT scan
was performed to evaluate his aorta. This showed a mild dilation
of the aortic root, cholelithiasis and a porcelain gallbladder.
An echo was obtained which revealed a mildly dilated aortic root
of 4.4cm and a normal ejection fraction. Heparin and
nitroglycerin were used intravenously and he remained chest pain
free. On [**2196-9-26**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was taken to the operating room where
he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to five vessels.
Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. On Postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 26228**] neurologically intact and was extubated. His chest tubes
were removed. He was then transferred to the step down unit for
further recovery. He was gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight while his supplemental oxygen was weaned
off. The physical therapy service was consulted to assist with
his postoperative strength and mobility. Beta blockade and
aspirin were resumed. Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to make steady progress
and was discharged to his home on postoperative day five. He
will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], his cardiologist and his
primary care physician as an outpatient.
