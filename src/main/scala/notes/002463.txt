Service:  Cardiothoracic

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 41-year-old male with
newly discovered aortic insufficiency referred by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16072**] to [**Hospital6 256**] for cardiac
catheterization to further evaluate his aortic valve and
determine his need for surgery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an active
otherwise healthy police officer who developed a cough about
a year ago.  The cough occurs only in the morning when he
first wakes up and is productive for yellow and sometimes
blood tinged secretions.  Since [**Month (only) 116**], he has been experiencing
profound shortness of breath.  He has also been getting up in
the middle of the night due to shortness of breath and
sleeping in an elevated position on the couch.  He denies
lightheadedness or orthopnea.  An echocardiogram done on [**6-23**] showed moderate left ventricular hypertrophy with an
ejection fraction of 50% and 4+ aortic insufficiency.  Aortic
valve was not coapting properly.  There was flow reversal in
the descending aorta, tricuspid regurgitation, normal PA
pressures with a mildly dilated LV outflow tract.  Also noted
were a dilated sinus of Valsalva and dilated ascending aorta.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension
2.  Remote tobacco use, quit 14 years ago

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:
1.  Atenolol 25 mg qd
2.  Captopril 25 mg [**Hospital1 **]

Height is 5 feet 10 inches.  Weight is 194 pounds.

LAB DATA:  White count 4.9, hematocrit 46.3, platelets 192.
Sodium 140, potassium 5.2, chloride 107, CO2 28, BUN 26,
creatinine 1.8, INR 1.1.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married police officer in [**Location (un) **].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of admission, the patient was
brought to the catheter lab where he underwent cardiac
catheterization.  Please see the catheter report for full
details.  In summary, the catheter showed 1+ mitral
regurgitation with 3+ to 4+ aortic insufficiency, normal
coronary arteries without lesions and ejection fraction of
45%.  Following his cardiac catheterization, Cardiothoracic
Surgery was consulted.  The patient was consented and agreed
to surgery.  On [**6-25**], he was brought to the Operating
Room.  Please see the Operating Room for full details.  In
summary, the patient had an aortic valve replacement with a
29 mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial valve.  He tolerated the
operation well and was transferred from the Operating Room to
the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  The patient did well
in the immediate postoperative period.  His anesthesia was
reversed.  Initial attempts at weaning him from the
ventilator were unsuccessful due to a relative hypoxia
requiring high [**Name (NI) 42684**] and 7.5 to 10 of PEEP.

On the morning of postoperative day #1, the patient's PEEP
was weaned to 5.  His FIO2 was also weaned and he was
successfully extubated.  During that period, the patient
remained hemodynamically stable and later in the day of
postoperative day #1, he was transferred from the Intensive
Care Unit to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] Six for continuing postoperative care and
cardiac rehabilitation.

On postoperative day #2, the patient's Foley and chest tubes
were discontinued.  His activity level was increased with the
assistance of the nursing staff and physical therapy.  Over
the next several days, the patient was noted to have a low
grade temperature with a maximum temperature of 101.9??????.  He
was pan cultured at that time.  Sputum and blood cultures
returned negative.  His urine culture came back positive with
an Escherichia coli urinary tract infection for which he was
treated with Levaquin 500 mg qd x14 days.  Additionally, the
patient had chest x-ray and echocardiogram, both of which
were negative for a fever source.  The patient continued to
progress in the postoperative period and on postoperative day
#7, it was deemed that he was stable and ready to be
discharged to home.

At the time of discharge, the patient's physical exam is as
follows:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 99.3??????, heart rate 84 sinus rhythm,
blood pressure 137/86, respiratory rate 18, O2 saturation 94%
on room air.  Weight preoperatively is 85.5 kg, at discharge
it is 82 kg.
LAB DATA:  White count 4.5, hematocrit 27.4, platelets 220.
