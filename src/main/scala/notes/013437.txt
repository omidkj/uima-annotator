Admission Date:  [**2121-2-6**]       Discharge Date:  [**2121-2-13**]



CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Severe chest pain, myocardial infarction.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a very pleasant,
81-year-old previously healthy, elderly female with no
the evening prior to admission the patient was awakened from
sleep by a [**9-18**] substernal chest pain.  At baseline the
patient is very active and suffers from no chest pain,
shortness of breath or dyspnea on exertion.  The episode
precipitating admission was associated with diaphoresis,
severe shortness of breath.  There was no associated nausea
or vomiting or palpitations.  The patient called EMS and was
anterior ST elevations and positive cardiac enzymes
suggesting myocardial infarction.  The patient was treated at
[**Hospital6 33**] with Nitroglycerin, Aspirin, Heparin and
Morphine and then transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for emergent cath.  At [**Hospital1 190**] cath revealed a 70% occlusion of the proximal
LAD, with serial thrombotic occlusions of 95 and 99% in the
mid to distal LAD.  The left circumflex and right coronary
arteries were found to be normal.  The proximal LAD was
stented with distal PTCA complicated by a small mid distal
dissection.  At cath her right atrial pressure was found to
be 27, pulmonary artery pressure was 65/35, pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure was 45 for which the patient was
given 20 mg of Lasix and Nitroglycerin drip as well as
Integrilin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Glaucoma, status post total hip
replacement, question history of sarcoid.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, Penicillin.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission, Timolol eyedrops.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  This is an 81-year-old woman, never married
and without children.  The patient denies history of tobacco
or alcohol use.  She lives alone in an [**Hospital3 **]
facility and is very active and social

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, vitals, temperature
96.9, blood pressure 128/56, heart rate 80, respiratory rate
18, O2 saturation 97% on two liters.  General, alert and
oriented times three, no apparent distress.  HEENT:  Pupils
are equal, round, and reactive to light, extraocular
movements intact, anicteric.  Neck soft and supple, with no
adenopathy.  Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally, good
aeration.  Heart, no JVD noted, regular rate and rhythm,
normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen
soft, nontender, non distended, small right lower quadrant
and anterior abdominal induration without tenderness or
overlying ecchymosis, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities,
warm and well perfused bilaterally, pulses within normal
limits and non edematous bilaterally.  Neuro, cranial nerves
II through XII intact, no gross motor deficits noted.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission sodium was 138, potassium 3.7,
chloride 102, CO2 23, BUN 19, creatinine 0.8, glucose 198,
white blood cell count 2.4, hematocrit 30.6, platelet count
227,000, PT 12.6, INR 1.1, PTT 25.4, CK #1 2974,
triglycerides 227, LDL 113, HDL 41.

Admission EKG showed sinus rhythm with anterior septal Q wave
and ST segment elevation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Anterior septal myocardial infarction:  The patient was
found to be suffering for acute myocardial syndrome as noted
above.  The patient was taken emergently to the cardiac
catheterization unit with the findings as noted in HPI.  The
patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled, CK #1 was found to be
2,974, CK #2 was 2824 with MB fraction of 290, CK #3 was 1800
with MB fraction of 178.  The patient's CK levels were
followed for two days with the last level being 279 with MB
fraction of 7 on [**2-9**].  The patient was kept in the cardiac
care unit immediately post cath and for 24 hours during which
time she was stable with no decreases in blood pressure.  The
patient also underwent an echocardiogram one day after
admission which showed mild regional left ventricular
dysfunction and question of apical akinesis or hypokinesis.
Ejection fraction was deemed to be 40-45%.  On [**2121-2-7**] the
patient was deemed to be stable and was transferred to the
cardiac medicine floor but remained on the CCU service.  The
patient was also diuresed as it was felt she might benefit
from some fluid reduction.  On the floor the patient had a
small continued O2 requirement in order to maintain her sats
above 90%.  This was felt to be due to a small component of
congestive heart failure and fluid overload.  Over the next
two days the patient was diuresed aggressively after which
the patient's O2 requirement decreased.  By the morning of
[**2-11**] the patient was off of supplemental oxygen and satting in
the 90's with no associated shortness of breath.  The
patient's evolving infarct was followed with serial EKGs
during admission.  No electrical or conduction abnormalities
arose.  On [**2121-2-12**] an echocardiogram was repeated to determine
the status of the patient's apical wall motion and the
possible benefit of future anticoagulation.  Based on the
results, the patient was started on low dose Coumadin.  The
patient will follow-up with respect to this issue and her
future cardiology course with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] at the [**Hospital1 1444**] Cardiology Clinic.  The
patient was also advised to follow-up with her own primary
care physician.

2.  Heme:  During admission the patient's hematocrit was
found to decrease requiring the transfusion of one unit of
packed red blood cells on two different occasions during
admission.  Stool guaiac was checked during both episodes and
found to be negative.  The patient was asymptomatic with
respect to lightheadedness, shortness of breath or chest pain
throughout both episodes.  Prior to admission the patient's
hematocrit was stable and above 30 for two days.

3.  Pulmonary:  The patient had a small supplemental O2
requirement early during the admission but resolved after
diuresis as noted above.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Anterior septal myocardial infarction.
2.  Congestive heart failure

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Enteric coated Aspirin 325 mg po q
day, Lasix 20 mg po q day, Coumadin 5 mg po q day, Zestril 10
mg po q day and Lopressor 12.5 mg po bid, Plavix 75 mg po q
day times 30 days and Nitroglycerin .4 mg sublingual prn.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharged to home with VNA services when
ready.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient will follow-up with her primary care
physician in two days for management of anticoagulation
issues.  The patient will follow-up with the [**Hospital1 346**] Cardiology Clinic within one week.
