Studies:
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2108-10-23**] 4:58 PM
Reason: line placement
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-23**], 4:08 p.m.

Right PIC line has been removed, new right internal jugular line
ends in the upper SVC and a new left PIC line ends just above
the superior cavoatrial junction. Lateral aspect of the left
lower chest is excluded from the study, other pleural surfaces
are unremarkable. Heart remains top normal size and there is
mild engorgement of pulmonary vasculature but no edema or
interval mediastinal widening or indication of pneumothorax.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

ANKLE (2 VIEWS) RIGHT  [**2108-10-23**] 4:59 PM

The ankle mortise is congruent without evidence of fracture.

Osteotomies involving the fourth and fifth metatarsals as well
as resection of the distal fourth ray are unchanged from the
previous exam. No cortical destruction is seen. There is soft
tissue swelling around the ankle and foot, likely representing
edema/cellulitis.

IMPRESSION: Soft tissue swelling likely indicating cellulitis.
No radiographic evidence of osteomyelitis.

Approved: TUE [**2108-10-23**] 7:01 PM

ECHO [**2108-10-24**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated.  No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 5-10 mmHg.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.  The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. A mass or vegetation on the
mitral valve cannot be excluded. There is probably moderate
valvular mitral stenosis (in part due to the significant MAC).
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of
mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is severe
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2106-12-28**],
the degree of pulmopnary hypertension detected has increased. If
clinically indicated, a TEE is recommended to exclude
endocarditis and to determine the degree of valvular mitral
stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 yo F h/o recurrent RLE cellulitis, IDDM, CAD s/p CABG
presents with RLE cellulitis and sepsis. On presentation, SBP
was 86, with lactate 3.6, WBC 19. SBP improved to 120s w/ 2L IVF
and her lactate dropped to 1.4. After 4-5th L IVF, SBP dropped
to the 80s. Was started on pressors and abx regimen of
daptomycin and vancomycin; transferred to MICU. In MICU pressors
weaned off, minimal maint IVF started. Was continued on
daptomycin and vancomycin, which were later changed to
piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin.  The L PICC line, which
the patient had had for 1 month, was pulled and tip sent for
culture. New PICC line placed, pt transferred out to floor.
[**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for blood sugar management. Podiatry was
consulted for surgery once cellulitis improved. ID was consulted
regarding antibiotic regimen.
.
# RLE cellulitis: Pt's erythema and tenderness resolving.
Underwent right 4th metatarsal head resection by podiatry on
[**2108-10-30**]. Bone samples were sent for microbiology and pathology
examination. Pt had bandage takedown by podiatry on POD #2,
cleared for discharge. Sent home on Vancomycin and Zosyn, to be
continued for 2 full weeks post-op, with possible extension to
4-week course pending micro/path results from biopsy specimen
sent from surgery.
.
# Recent sepsis: Pt stabilized after IVF, continued to have
stable BP while on medicine wards.
.
# CAD: Pt was without symptoms of CAD during her hospital stay.
She was continued on her home regimen of ASA, statin, BB, and
ACE-I.
.
# IDDM: Pt's FSBS were uncontrolled, likely given her infection
and then surgical course, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted regarding
adjustments to her home diabetes regimen. After adjustments were
made during the hospitalization, [**Last Name (un) **] recommended changing her
back to her home insulin regimen in preparation for discharge.
She had appropriate control of her FSBS on this home regimen
after her
