History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 44 yo woman with h/o anxiety who presented to
an OSH ED with abdominal pain. Mrs. [**Known lastname 8738**] was reportedly in
her normal state of health until approximately 9 am this
morning, when she developed abdominal pain. She vomited twice
and then developed worsening abdominal pain radiating to her
back. She also had associated palpitations and diaphoresis. She
thus presented to [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**] for further evaluation.
.
At the OSH ED, her initial VS were BP 204/100, P 138, R 36, O2
99% on RA. She was initially given Zofran, 1L of NS, and she was
ordered for a CTA to evaluate for PE and aortic dissection.
While in the CT scanner, she became increasingly hypoxic and
confused and was emergently intubated. She was also given
Diltiazem 10 mg IV for tachycardia and received one dose of
Lasix 60 mg IV. EKG at the time demonstrated STE in V2 with ST
depressions in V3-V6, so she was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for urgent
cardiac catheterization.
.
In the cath lab, she was found to have clean coronary arteries.
She was found to have a PCWP of 25, and bedside TTE demonstrated
an EF of 25-30%. She developed tachycardia to the 160s, for
which she received Adenosine x3 and carotid massage, which did
not improve the tachycardia. She was then given another dose of
Diltiazem, which briefly decreased her pulse to the 130s. She
became hypotensive to SBP of 70, was started on Levophed, and
was transferred to the CCU.
.
In the CCU, the patient is intubated and sedated and cannot
provide further history. Per her family, she has been
complaining of frequent sweating, an increase in her resting
tremor, and recent diarrhea. Otherwise, she has had no recent
complaints.
.
Review of systems was unable to be obtained.


Past Medical History:

Social History:
 The patient lives with her husband and son in [**Name (NI) **], MA. She
has three children who all live in the area. She currently works
in medical records. She does not smoke cigarettes and she drinks
~1 glass wine/night. She does not use illicit drugs

Family History:
No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or
sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.

RESULT: NO MUTATION DETECTED

Interpretation: Nucleotide sequence analysis of the RET
[**Last Name (un) **]-oncogene (exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16) was
negative for mutations associated with MEN2 or FMTC. This
negative result must be evaluated in conjunction with this
patient's clinical findings and family history. This assay
will not detect all mutations causing MEN2 or FMTC.

Laboratory results and submitted clinical information
reviewed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 61649**]-Burckle, Ph.D., ABMG, CGMB, HCLD.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) is an autosomal
dominant genetic disorder with a high lifetime risk of
medullary thyroid cancer. It is classified into three
subtypes, MEN2A, familial medullary thyroid carcinoma
(FMTC), and MEN2B, based on the presence of other clinical
presentations. MEN2 is caused by mutations in the RET
[**Last Name (un) **]-oncogene. This assay detects disease-causing mutations
in over 95% of MEN2A and MEN2B cases, and over 85% of FMTC
cases. Mutation identification can be used to confirm a
diagnosis, screen individuals at risk for familial disease,
or distinguish familial from sporadic disease.

In this assay, sequences including exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15
and 16 of the RET [**Last Name (un) **]-oncogene are amplified from genomic
DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by
nucleotide sequence analysis on an automated capillary DNA
sequencer. Particular attention is paid to the sequence
changes at the codons known to be hot spots for mutations
causing MEN2. Since genetic variation and other problems can
affect the accuracy of direct mutation testing, the results
should always be interpreted in light of clinical and
familial data.

STUDIES:
[**5-7**] TTE:  Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 20 %) secondary to akinesis of all basal
segments, hypokinesis of the midventricular segments, and
relative preservation of apical function, although the true apex
was poorly visualized. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion.

[**5-7**] post-line CXR:  In comparison with the earlier study of this
date, there has been placement of a left IJ catheter that
extends to the mid portion of the SVC.  However, there has also
been the development of a large left pneumothorax.

Transabdominal U/S:
IMPRESSION: 8.9 cm right adnexal mass appears to engulf the
right ovary but does not appear to arise from it and appears
immediately adjacent to the right uterine fundus, though it does
not show typical signs that it arises from it.  This suggests
that it may be adnexal in origin and a differential possibility
includes extra-adrenal paraganglioma, given the known right
adrenal mass. For further characterization of this lesion, MRI
would be very helpful.
