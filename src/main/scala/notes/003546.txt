Brief Hospital Course:
She was taken to the OR by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for exploratory
laparotomy, right
adrenalectomy and right hepatic segment 6 resection. Please see
operative report for details. EBL was 3 liters. An introp U/S
revealed- liver echogenicity appeared unremarkable. Within the
posterior segment of the right lobe of the liver, there was s a
5.5 x 3.3 cm well- circumscribed, slightly hypoechoic lesion
that contained a degree of increased through transmission
suggesting at least some cystic components. The relationship of
this to the surrounding vasculature, particularly the posterior
branch of the right portal vein was demonstrated. No other
additional lesions were found.Two [**Doctor Last Name **] drains were removed by
postop day 5. Pathology returned positive for 1. Right adrenal
mass, excision (A-F):
Malignant neoplasm most consistent with adrenal cortical
carcinoma, see note.
2. Liver segment six, resection (G-O):
Malignant neoplasm most consistent with adrenal cortical
carcinoma, see note. Endocrinology was to follow and the plan
was to use ________ as an outpatient.

Postop she was in the SICU for fluid management and ATN.
Baseline creatinine was 0.6. Nephrology was consulted.
Creatinine trended down to 1.1 by POD 8. Renal u/s was normal.
Stress dose steroids were given preop and postop per
Endocrinology. Endocrinology preferred a slow 6 month steroid
taper. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] tapered prednisone after one week as she
developed an incision infection necessitating opening the
incision and using a wound vac.  A CT of the abd was done on
which demonstrated Two ill-defined fluid collections
post-surgical site that were extrahepatic and could represent
postoperative seromas, bilomas, or less likely abscesses.
Multiple scattered foci of air, likely postoperative. 2.
Increased stranding about the head of the pancreas, possibly
pancreatitis. 3. Bibasilar atelectasis and small right pleural
effusion. Amylase and lipase were normal. LFTs preop were ast
1298, alt 1308, alk phos 64 and tbili 0.7. These trended down
postop with the exception of the alk phos which increased to as
high as 806 on HD 20. Subsequently, this has decreased some to
504 as of [**11-13**].

She required PICC line placement for IV antibiotics and TPN as
her kcals were insufficient. Her appetite was diminished. She
appeared apathetic on many days and expressed feelings of
sadness. Psychiatry saw her and agreed with the team that she
was experiencing intermittent delerium. There was concern that
she was experiencing the effects of less cortisol. Neurology
recommended a CT and EEG.  A head CT was done for waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 688**]
mental status. This was negative for bleed/mass on [**10-29**]. An EEG
was performed which demonstrated mild encephalopathy. TSH was
3.4.  Psychiatry did not recommend antidepressents or stimulants
at the time.

On CT a right pleural effusion was noted. She experienced desats
and sob. Pleuracentesis was performed on [**11-6**] (HD 20)with a
negative culture. A f/u cxr was improved and without
pneumothorax.

She developed a Klebsiella uti which was treated with Cipro and
Flagyl for the wound x 4 days. These antibiotics were switched
to Vanco and Meropenum when a wound culture identified strep
veridans, sparse yeast, Klebsiella which was pan sensitive and
staph coag positive resistent to levo/oxicillin/penicillin and
sensitive to vanco. Vanco levels were monitored. Creatinine
remained stable. She developed a 2nd UTI,yeast which was treated
with a GU Ampho bladder irrigant x3 days. This was due to finish
on [**11-13**] pm. Repeat u/a and cx were sent on [**11-13**].

A repeat abd CT revealed stable appearance of hepatic fluid
collections with some debris and air in the surgical bed.
Bibasilar atelectasis with stable right pleural effusion.
Stable appearance of right abdominal wall defect overlying
surgical site. Interval development of nonocclusive thrombus
within the intrahepatic inferior vena cava. She was started on
coumadin and IV heparin until she was therapeutic. INR Goal was
[**1-31**]. INR on [**11-13**] was 2.6

On [**11-12**] after taking off the vac and reviewing the CT, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**]
drain was inserted thru the wound into a peri-hepatic collection
and placed to bulb suction.  Water soluble contrast was
administered at the bedside through this catheter. Contrast was
administered. Contrast was seen surrounding this wound and
draining along the right lateral aspect of the wound into
dressing, however, no definite communication into the abdominal
cavity noted. Midline chevron scar and multiple clips scattered
across the abdomen were seen. Remainder of abdomen was gasless.
Small amount of oral contrast seen in the rectum.  She then
underwent successful drainage catheter placement in collection
in the subhepatic and hepatic areas on [**2194-11-12**].

The plan is for her to go to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on TPN via a R picc
with a RUQ incision wound vac. She has 2 hepatic drains to
gravity drainage and meropenum/vanco will continue
