EKG#1: new Qs in v2-v4, 2mm STE v2-v4; ST depressions I, avL
.
EKG#2: ? slow VT, rate 80 (AIVR)
.
[**6-17**] CXR IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**6-14**] and 22:
Intraaortic balloon pump has been removed. Lung volumes remain
low with persistent atelectasis at the right base, but
insufficient abnormality in the lungs to explain respiratory
failure. Moderate cardiomegaly and a generally large and
tortuous thoracic aorta are unchanged in appearance. There is no
pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural effusion. Tip of
endotracheal tube is in standard placement at the thoracic
inlet. No pneumothorax.
.
[**6-19**] CT head IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage
.
[**6-22**] Ct Abd Pelvis IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of intra-abdominal collection or large hematoma.
2. Small amount of fluid and air and moderate amount of air in
the abdomen likely related to the peritoneal dialysis.
3. Multicystic kidneys. Some of the cysts are complex and not
well evaluated in this non-contrast study. Some of the cysts are
increased when compared to prior study. There is a new area of
calcification in the left kidney. If indicated this cysts could
be further evaluated with ultrasound or MRI.
4. Gallstones.
5. Severe coronary artery calcifications.
.
Cath report:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography showed a left dominant system.
LMCA
had a 20% origin stenosis. The LAD had a 90% origin stenosis
involving
also a D1 (90%). Rest of the LAD was diffusely diseased with
60-70%
sequential lesions. LCX had mild itraluminal irregularities with
50% OM
and 60% distal LCX disease. RCA was chronically occluded
distally with
R->L and R->R collaterals.
2. Left ventriculography was deferred.
3. Aortic root aortography showed markedly dilated aortic root.
4. Hemodynamic assessment reaveled a depressed Cardiac Index
1.7-1.9
and PCWP of 35 (with large V-waves).
5. The lesion in the proximal LAD was predilated with a 2.0 X
09mm
Maverick balloon and stented with a 2.5 X 12mm Minivision stent.
The
final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with no residual stenosis,
6. Under fluoroscopic guidance, we then placed a 40cc intra
aortic
balloon pump just beyond the left subclavian origin. Successful
diastolic augmentation of blood pressure was achieved.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca
and IABP.
 PTCA of  vessel.
4. Successful stenting of the proximal LAD lesion with a bare
metal
stent.
5. Successful placement of a 40cc intra aortic balloon pump.

[**6-15**] TTE:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with moderate cavity dilation and severe
global hypokinesis. The basal inferior and inferolateral walls
contract best with the more distal left ventricular segments
near akinetic. There is an apical left ventricular aneurysm. No
intraventricular thrombus is identified. Tissue velocity imaging
E/e' is elevated (>15) suggesting increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is at least mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior report (images reviewed)
of [**2130-10-4**], the left ventricular findings are new and c/w
multivessel CAD. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation and
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension are now present.

ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2133-6-24**] 6:15 PM

ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)
.
COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis [**2133-6-22**] and portable
abdomen [**2133-6-22**].
.
ABDOMEN, UPRIGHT AND SUPINE: Only one of these radiographs
includes the right hemidiaphragm. There are small ovoid-shaped
collections of free intra- abdominal air layering above the
liver and stomach. Large and small bowel are of normal caliber.
There is no evidence of obstruction. Extensive stool is noted
within the right colon. A peritoneal dialysis catheter coils
over the left abdomen into the pelvis. Surrounding osseous and
soft tissue structures are unchanged.
.
IMPRESSION: Small collections of free intra-abdominal air above
the liver and stomach which is expected given presence of
peritoneal dialysis catheter.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment: 68yo M with ESRD on PD, prostate Ca p/w ACS and
severe 2VD presented with CP and taken to cath lab and found to
have 2VD with stent to LAD and subsequent men
