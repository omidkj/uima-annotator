Brief Hospital Course:
.
# UGIB: Pt was found with a HCT of 10 at [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital and
coffee grounds that
didn't fully clear on NG lavage.  His BP at [**Last Name (un) 4068**] dropped to
the
80s, with tachycardia to the 120s.   He received several liters
of
fluid and two units of prbcs. He was subsequently transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] where he was evaluted by GI and lavaged bright red blood
taht could not be cleared. He was transfused 2 additional units
of prbcs for a hct of 23.  SBP were stable at 130-140s. He had
an EGD on the night of admission which did not show a clear
source of bleed.  In addition there was an initial question of
duodenal varices. He was then transferred to the ICU for closer
monitoring and started on a PPI gtt. Had abdominal ultrasound
with dopplers which was unremarkable and without evidence of
portal hypertension making duodenal ulcers unlikely.  He then
had a repeat EGD which showed folding in the duodenum likely
accounting for intial concern of varices. It did show duodenal
ulcer.  Pt subsequently had a stable Hct and was transferred to
the floor.  His PPI was changed to an oral PPI.  He underwent a
colonoscopy which showed diverticui in the sigmoid and
descending colon as well as internal hemorroids.  Given that
there was still a concern that the source of bleed was not
found, he had a capsule endoscopy (placed via EGD). The capsule
study was not capturing but during the procedure but he was
found to have a small bleeding AVM that was clipped and
cauterized.  Thus it was felt his bleed could have been due to
this AVM and further pursuit of a capsule study during this
hospitalization was felt unneccessary.  His diet was
subsequently advanced.  His Hct remained stable.  He was
discharged with instructions that GI would be in touch in case
they were indeed able to capture the study as hoped and if he
needed additional follow up as an outpatient.
.
# Cardiac/HTN: Pts Metoprolol and ACE were intially held but
restarted once his Hct and BP were stable.
.
# Carotid stent/atherosclerosis: Both the pts asa/plavix were
initially held in setting of bleed.  [**Hospital1 **] surgery was
following and wanted pt to be restarted as soon as possible
however given bleed they were not restarted. His asa was
restarted at 81mg daily on hospital day #2 but plavix not
restarted before discharge as it was felt to be too high of a
risk. The patient will follow up with his PCP and will likely
need to restart his medication in [**6-11**] days as long has his Hct
is stable and he does not have further signs of bleeding.  His
PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] via letter to let him know that the plavix had
been held and would need to be restarted.
.
#Fever-Pt had a fever to 101.9 2 days prior to discharge. He was
asymtomatic and did not have an elevation in his WBC. A U/A was
negative, blood cultures were sent (NGTD on day of discharge)
and a CXR showed no evidence of infiltrate.  No further
intervention felt necessary.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you were found to have
a low blood count and had some bleeding from your colon.  You
received 2 Units of blood while you were here.  You had some
procedures done to identify the site of bleeding.  You have an
ulcer in your stomach and were started on a medication called
Pantoprazole to help reduce stomach acid. In addition you were
found to have some diverticuli in your colon as explained while
you were here which likely contributed to the bleed.
.
Your Plavix was held because it causes thinning of your blood
and makes the bleeding worse. You will need to continue to hold
this medicine until you follow up with your primary care doctor.
You can continue your aspirin.
.
If you have any ongoing lightheadedness, dizziness, bleeding
from below, chest pain or shortness of breath, please call your
doctor or return to the ER.
