immediately following narcan. Currently awake, alert, and
breathing comfortably. As the patient has a seizure disorder
with daily myoclonic jerks, may also consider post-ictal state

and baclofen held, narcotics limited. Patient continued to
improve cognitively and was essentially back to baseline the
morning of her discharge.

Patient recently underwent 7 day course of ciprofloxacin for
UTI. Now with continued positive urinalysis in the setting of
chronic indwelling foley which was changed. Got one dose of CTX,
but this likely doesn't represent an active infection. Urine
showed yeast infection. No treatment initiated.

Chronic. On 4L home O2. Patient likely chronically retains CO2
as admission HCO3 was in low 30s. Continued Albuterol,
