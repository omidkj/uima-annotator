Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3129**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension/Fevers

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 year old male with history of renal transplant in
[**2145**] on prednisone recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**], now being
admitted for persistent low-grade fevers after dialysis
accompanied by hemodynamic changes including hypotension and
RVR. Fevers have been low grade of around 100. Some associated
chills. Patient states these have been occurring over the past
2-3 weeks, and do seem to be related to dialysis. He had
previously been on dialysis before his transplant in [**2145**] for
about 6 months but has not been on dialysis since then until
about 3 weeks ago.
 He has a chronic [**Year (4 digits) **] which is non-productive for the past
year. He states that he previously had such a [**Year (4 digits) **] due to
rapamune toxicity which he no longer takes. He is being admitted
directly.

Pertinent Results:
[**12-28**] portable CXR:
IMPRESSION: Improved interstitial edema with persistent opacity
at left lung base.

[**12-28**] CT chest/abd/pelvis:
CT OF THE CHEST: Tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities within the posterior
right upper lobe are new since [**2151-10-25**], and may
represent infection or inflammation. Patchy opacity at the left
lung base persists, and there is more extensive peribronchiolar
thickening and bronchiectasis at the left lung base, also
concerning for recurrent infection or aspiration.Calcified focus
at the left lung base may represent a granuloma. There are small
bilateral pleural effusions, not significantly changed from
[**2151-10-2**]. Extensive coronary artery calcification as well
as calcification of the aortic valve and annulus are noted. The
pulmonary artery remains prominent, measuring 4.1 cm, suggesting
underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. Mediastinal lymph
nodes are numerous in number, although only a couple of
precarinal and prevascular nodes are enlarged by size criteria,
and are not significantly changed from multiple prior exams.
Extensive calcified plaque within the descending aorta. Tiny
hiatal hernia.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN: On this non-contrast CT, the liver, spleen,
pancreas,
gallbladder, and intra- abdominal small and large bowel loops
are normal. Left adrenal gland is normal. There is an unchanged
tiny nodule of the right adrenal gland. The kidneys are shrunken
consistent with chronic renal disease. There is a nodular
contour to the gastric fundus (2:55), and soft tissue density in
this area that could represent intraluminal contents although
mass cannot be excluded on the provided images (appearance less
marked with only possible slight wall thickening in this
location in [**2151-10-2**]). Retroperitoneal nodes, some
enlarged, are unchanged.

CT OF THE PELVIS: Atrophied renal transplant is noted in the
right lower
quadrant, with a surgical clip within the upper pole. There is
an unchanged (since [**2145**]) intermediate density rounded
collection in the right pelvis, abutting the right common iliac
vein and likely representing a lymphocele. There is no pelvic
free fluid. Pelvic lymph nodes are not significantly changed,
the largest measuring 2.4 x 1.8 cm in the left external iliac
nodal station (2:111).

There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There are
extensive
degenerative changes in the thoracolumbar spine with partial
ankylosis at L5- S1 and high-grade compression deformity of the
L1 vertebral body, unchanged. Multiple old right rib fractures
are again noted.

IMPRESSION:
1. New/worsened bibasilar tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities and left lower
lobe
peribronchial thickening, concerning for foci of aspiration
and/or infection.
2. Density at gastric fundus could represent luminal contents
although soft tissue mass cannot be excluded; UGI examination or
EGD could be obtained for further characterization.
3. No evidence of intra-abdominal or intrapelvic abscess.
4. Unchanged fluid collection abutting the right iliac vein,
which again may represent a lymphocele.
5. Unchanged mildly enlarged lymph nodes in the torso.

[**12-30**] Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-15mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. There is mild to moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral
akinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
35-40%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
borderline normal free wall function. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses
or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen. Mild to moderate left
ventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w CAD. Moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension

[**12-30**] RUQ US:
IMPRESSION: Normal right upper quadrant ultrasound without
evidence of acute cholecystitis.

[**12-30**] Upper and Lower Extremities US:
No DVTs.

[**1-1**] Ankle Plain Xrays:
Three radiographs of the left ankle demonstrate soft tissue
swelling overlying the lateral malleolus. No fracture is
identified. The mortise is congruent.  The talar dome contour is
smooth. Mineralization is normal. Atherosclerotic calcifications
are seen.

IMPRESSION:
Soft tissue swelling overlying the lateral malleolus.

[**2152-1-5**] MRI of L ankle: 1. Soft tissue ulceration extending to 1
mm of cortex of lat malleolus suspicious for osteomyelitis.  2.
Peroneal tenosynovitis  3. remote injury of tibio-talar ligament
4. subchondral signal changes in talar-navicular joint related
to neuropathy. 5. Mild edema in calcaneous. 6. longitudinal tear
of pero
