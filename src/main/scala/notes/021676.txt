Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis

History of Present Illness:
72 yo M with HTN, HLD, and DMII presenting with worsening
exertional dyspnea and chest pain for the past three days. He
and his family report that he had been in his usual state of
health, but began to notice that he would have to rest after
walking up stairs and later after walking on flat ground. He
denies symptoms at rest, no orthopnea, no PND, no change in
chronic LE edema, no increased salt intake, but does report a
chronic noctural nonproductive cough. He denies sharp chest
pains and his symptoms were not positional.
.
Wednesday evening, he reported having such difficulty breathing
walking to his car that he could barely walk more than a few
steps, prompting a family friend to drive him to the emergency
room. He denies recent viral illness, but does report having
multiple "colds" this year. No fevers or chills, occasional
"sweats" that he attributes to his blood sugar being low, but no
over night sweats. He has lost 10 lbs in the last 2 months, but
has intentionally been trying to eat less.
.
He is originally from Somolia and [**Last Name (un) **] to [**Country 16465**] in [**2087**]. He
later moved to [**Location (un) 86**] in [**2092**]. He is not currently working, but
previously worked as a tractor operator. He denies known TB
exposure and is unsure of his PPD status (of note, according to
our medical records, it appears he may have had a positive
[**Location (un) 1131**] in the past). No history of chest trauma or
intrathoracic surgeries.
.
In the ED, his initial vitals were 98.3, 75, 150/70, 17, 100%
2-4L NC. A EKG revealed NSR at 80 bpm with evidence of
electrical alternans. His labs were significant for a K of 8.4,
a hct of 26.8, a bicarb 16, and Cr of 2.4. Pt underwent a
bedside echo which revealed a large pericardial effusion with
evidence of tamponade physiology. He was given 40 mg of lasix IV
and remained hemodynamically stable. He was then taken to the
cath lab for pericardiocentesis and then transferred to the CCU
for further management.
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient reported feeling much
better. His breathing as significantly improved, although he
reports having some pain at the incision site that is worse with
sitting forward. He is not having other chest pain, no numbness
or tingling or palpitations.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
All of the other review of systems were negative.

Transthoracic Echos
TTE ([**2108-5-17**] at 11:11:46 PM)
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There is a moderate to large sized pericardial effusion. There
is sustained right atrial collapse, consistent with low filling
pressures or early tamponade. There is significant, accentuated
respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows,
consistent with impaired ventricular filling.
IMPRESSION: Moderate to large pericardial effusion with evidence
of early tamponade physiology.
