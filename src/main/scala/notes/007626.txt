Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
hemoptysis s/p right heart cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right heart catheterization
pulmonary artery coil embolization

History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:
CC:  80 yo F with AS s/p biprosthetic AVR in 12/99, MR with most
recent LVEF of 55%, Afib, asthma/COPD referred who was initially
referred for RHC +/- exercise, and possible LHC for progressive
shortness of breath who was found to have hemoptysis of 150 cc
during RHC after SGC was inflated.

Pt has had long history of SOB. Of note she was recently
hospitalized at [**Hospital3 1443**] hospital for worsening SOB
with dyspnea on exertion. She was treated for CHF with diuresis
and for her pulmonary disease and was d/c. At home pt reports
DOE and is unable to climb stair or walk far without symptoms.
She has no dyspnea at rest.Humidity exacerbates her SOB. She
sleeps with 1-2 pillows and denies PND or LE edema.

Recently the patient has been seen by her outpatient
cardiologist to determine whethere the SOB is directly related
to MR prior to any definitive treatment or surgical
intervention. For these reasons she was referred to have a RHC
+/- exercise +/- LHC/coronary angiography.
.
On review of system, pt reports dyspnea on exertion, cough,
hemoptysis.
.
She denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, black stools or red stools. She denies
recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies exertional buttock
or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

Cardiac catheterization [**2104-6-23**]:
1. Mild pulmonary aterial hypertension.
2. Moderate right ventricular diastolic heart failure.
3. Elevated PCW pressures consistent with at least moderate left

ventricular diastolic heart failure, with prominent V waves
consistent
with her known mitral regurgitation.
4. Exercise portion of the hemodynamic assessment was aborted
following
development of self-limited hemoptysis, likely due to rupture of
a
small right upper or middle lobe pulmonary arteriole and
secondary
pulmonary hemorrhage following inflation of the SGC balloon
after the
Swan-Ganz catheter had migrated more distally during calibration
of the
transducer system while the patient was sitting upright on the
exercise
ergometer and thus not amenable to fluoroscopic evaluation.

CXR ([**6-23**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
2. Nodular density projects over the heart. Recommend PA and
lateral views when possible.

CXR ([**6-24**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Nodule no longer visualized.
2. Chronic mediastinal widening with new right apical extension.
If the
patient has referable findings such as chest pain or Horner
syndrome, CT is indicated to evaluate for right apical lung
lesion. If CT is going to be performed for hemoptysis, this
finding will be evaluated at that time.
3. Possible right neck hematoma. Correlate clinically.

CTA chest ([**6-26**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Partially thrombosed pseudoaneurysm in right middle lobe
medial segment pulmonary artery with localized surrounding
hemorrhage, but no active extravasation.
2. Retained catheter fragment in the main pulmonary artery.
3. Contrast refluxing into the IVC suggests right heart
dysfunction.
4. Mild enlargement of the main and central pulmonary arteries
suggests
pulmonary hypertension.
5. Left renal hypodensity can be further evaluated with renal
ultrasound if clinically indicated.

COIL EMBOLIZATION PROCEDURE ([**2104-7-1**])
FINDINGS: The right pulmonary arteriogram, as well as selective
arteriograms of the segmental arteries supplying the middle lobe
of the right lung did not show evidence of the small
pseudoaneurysm seen on CT.
Three-dimensional rotation angiography as well as cone beam CT
reconstructions also failed to precisely demonstrate filling of
the pseudoaneurysm.
COMPLICATIONS: No immediate complications.
IMPRESSION: Inability to precisely demonstrate the 1-cm
pseudoaneurysm seen to arise from the right pulmonary artery
within the right lung-middle lobe. A followup CT pulmonary
arteriogram will be obtained to assess for persistence or
thrombosed status of the pseudoaneurysm.

CXR PA AND LATERAL ([**2104-7-4**])
Lung volumes are low. There is increased right infrahilar
opacity and possibly new left retrocardiac opacity compatible
with developing infection. Small bilateral pleural effusions are
increased. Heart size is severely enlarged as before. Sternal
wires are intact. Prosthetic aortic valve is unchanged.
Atherosclerotic calcification of aortic arch is present and
prominence of the mediastinal contour related to increased
ascending aorta diameter is better characterized on CT.
