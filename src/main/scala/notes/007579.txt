[**7-6**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is markedly dilated. Mild
spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the
body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the
right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low
normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve shows characteristic
rheumatic deformity. There is moderate valvular mitral stenosis
(area 1.0-1.5cm2). Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in
person of the results on mr. [**Known firstname 8096**] at 8:30AM. POST_BYPASS:
Normal RV systolic function. Intact thoracic aortic contour.
There is a mechanical prosthesis in the mitral positions, with
the two leaflets opening and closing well and the transmitral
gradient is 2mm of Hg. There is no residual MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 8097**]c function is 50%.

CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2151-7-11**] 11:19 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: interval change

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
62 year old man with CABG/MVA SJ
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
interval change
PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON [**2151-7-11**] AT 11:19

INDICATION: Recent cardiac surgery. Check for interval change.

COMPARISON: [**2151-7-8**].

FINDINGS: Direct comparison of the frontal view shows less
density in the left lower lung field. There is continued
evidence of bilateral plate-like atelectasis. Upper lungs remain
clear. Cardiomegaly is no different. The lateral view does not
show significant differences compared to a prior lateral view
from [**2151-6-30**].

IMPRESSION:

Slightly improved aeration of the left lower lung field on the
frontal view but overall little meaningful interval change.


Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 6402**] was transferred from OSH
with severe mitral stenosis and congestive heart failure. On
[**6-29**] he underwent a cardiac cath which revealed one vessel
coronary artery disease. He was then appropriately worked up for
pending surgery. Thoracic surgery was consulted due to finding
of hilar and mediastinal adenopathy. He also required dental
clearance prior to surgery. He was medically managed while
awaiting surgery. On [**7-6**] he was brought to the operating room
where he underwent a mitral valve replacement, coronary artery
bypass graft and mediastinal lymph node biopsy. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op day one he was
started on beta blockers and diuretics and gently diuresed
towards his pre-op weight. Later this day he was transferred to
the telemetry floor for further care. On post-op day two he had
episode of rapid atrial fibrillation and was given increased
beta blockers, amiodarone and magnesium. Chest tubes and
epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. He remained
in atrial fibrillation and was started on coumadin for his
mechanical valve.
His sodium dropped and he was started on a fluid restriction. EP
was consulted for continued rapid atrial fibrillation/flutter,
he was restarted on an amiodarone drip and cardioversion was
planned. Sodium improved with IV lasix. He was cardioverted to
NSR on [**7-14**]. He remained in NSR, was cleared by physical therapy
and was ready for discharge home on POD #9.
