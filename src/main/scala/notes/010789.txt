Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2698**]
Chief Complaint:
lethargy, decreased po intake, nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 75 yo man with pmh sig for CAD, s/p CABG [**2086**] with
stress imaging [**8-/2102**] with fixed reversible defect only, colon
ca (normal scope [**2100**]), melanoma, right middle and lower
lobectomy of lung and radiation of lung as treatment of
carcinoid tumor, congestive heart failure, and recent onset of
atrial fibrillation who has had increased nausea over the past
year with marked increase accompanied by poor po intake to only
minimal fluids. He was scheduled for an elective cardiac
catheterization to evaluate a cardiac etiology of his vague
symtoms, as all other work-ups have been unremarkable. He was
noted to have increased lethargy to the point of "difficulty to
arouse" for the past few days.

On day of admission he was Seen by PCP at home who found him to
be, oliguric & hypotensive.  Increased fluid replacement was not
successful in increasing BP and patient was sent to ED.  On
presentation to the [**Name (NI) **] pt is unable to answer questions other
than "yes/no", but history is given by family. He denies chest
pain, has had some shortness of breath at rest, no orthopnea or
pnd, no dysuria, nausea but no vomitting, and no fever/chills.
He has had over 10 pound weight loss over the past year.

CT Head:
FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, mass lesion,
hydrocephalus, shift of normally midline structures, minor or
major vascular territorial infarct. [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. Osseous and soft- tissue
structures are unremarkable.
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The right atrial appendage appears to be akinetic.
The right ventricular free wall is severely hypokinetic. The
left ventricular functon is moderately depressed (LVEF ~30-35%)
with global hypokinesis, inferior akinesis and inferobasal
akinesis/dyskinesis. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Mild-moderate ([**2-4**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. An eccentric
jet of mild to moderate ([**2-4**]+) is seen directed toward the left
atrial appendage. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation is seen.There is no
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
    Respiratory Failure: In the ER pH 7.18, CO2 98, with
hypercarbic lethargy. After repeat ABG revealed increasing CO2,
the patient was intubated. The suspected etiology of his
respiratory failure was a chronic respiratory acidosis with
superimposed acute metabolic acidosis from acute renal failure,
causing decompensation and marked acidemia.
    A swan-ganz catheter was placed and numbers were consistent
with hypovolemia with a small element of heart failure.  Pt
underwent fluid resuscitation and was placed on dopamine with
good response and improvement in renal function, and Levaquin
was started for possible sepsis/pulm infection.  Small bump in
CK and Troponin postulated secondary to demand ischemia. TEE
done while intubated showed no change in cardiac function from
previous TTE at OSH.
    On hopital day 4, it was felt that he may be volume
overloaded after fluid resuscitation in setting of CHF with
elevated CVP, PAPD, and also was demonstrating low SVR likely
due to sepsis. Decreased UOP this day was thought to be due to
low perfusion in setting of elevated preload and so he was
placed back on renal dose dopamine and given lasix for diuresis
until his numbers were consistent with euvolemia. He was soon
after weaned off all pressors and extubated.  Pulmonary was
consulted for episodes of hypercarbia during sleep, bipap was
suggested but refused by patient.  The plan was to follow up
with pulmonary as an outpatient with a formal sleep study.  As
part of the work up for increased nausea and lethargy a CT scan
of the head was completed which was normal.

    Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had known atrial
fibrillation but was NSR on admission, and had recently been
started on sotalol.  He had an episode of atrial fibrillation
with short reponse to 100J cardioversion, was started on
amiodorone and then converted spontaneously. He was later placed
on Metoprolol as well.
