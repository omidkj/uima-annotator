Pertinent Results:
[**2167-4-14**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): Heart is at the upper limit of
normal.  Lung fields are clear and symmetric.  No focal
consolidation or infiltrate is seen.  There is no pneumothorax
or pleural effusion.  No evidence of congestive heart failure.
Stable examination as compared to 3 days ago.  Cardiac size at
upper limit of normal.
.
[**2167-4-15**] ECG: Sinus tachycardia
Nonspecific T wave changes in lead V3
Since previous tracing of [**2167-4-14**], ventricular rate faster, and
further T waves
changes present
.
[**2167-4-20**] ECHO: The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left
ventricular
wall motion is normal. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal
left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and  free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly  thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.  The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral  regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial
effusion.  Compared with the report of the prior study (images
unavailable for review) of  [**2163-8-4**], the findings are similar.

.
[**2167-4-20**] CHEST (PORTABLE AP): There is no evidence of pneumonia.
There are low lung volumes, which result in pulmonary vascular
crowding, though mild superimposed vascular congestion is
difficult to exclude.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
1) ASTHMA FLARE:
Pt's presentation was consistent with asthma flare.  There was
no evidence of underlying or superimposed infection.  While in
the MICU, she was started on steroids, nebulizers, and singulair
and advair were added to her long-term regimen given her poor
asthma control.  On the floor, these were continued and her
steroids were tapered gradually.  Her oxygenation improved and
she was on room air.  Her breathing was also much better and
close to baseline by discharge.
