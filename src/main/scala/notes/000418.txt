Pertinent results:
CXR: Bedside AP and lateral views labeled "upright, stretcher at
10:00 p.m." are compared with PA and lateral views dated
[**2117-8-29**].  Allowing for differences in radiographic technique,
motion-blurring and patient positioning, the overall appearance
is essentially unchanged.  There is evidence of pulmonary
hyperinflation with diaphragm flattening, suggestive of
underlying obstructive lung disease, but no focal airspace
process is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and pulmonary
vessels are unchanged with no evidence of CHF.  DISH involving
the thoracic spine is redemonstrated.

ECHO [**8-/2117**]: Mild LAE, mild LVH, normal function (EF>55%).  RV
size and free wall motion normal.  Mod to severe AS, no AR.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 74F Vancomycin for MRSA bacteremia, transferred from [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab for worsening rash and persistent bacteremia.
.
# Rash:  On presentation, dermatology was consulted.   They
believe that it is most consistent with AGEP (acute generalized
exanthematous pustulosis), which is a drug hypersensitivity
recation.  Fever and leukocytosis can acompany this reaction.
They recommened supportive care.  A biopsy was taken and should
be follow up after the patient is discharged.  Petrolatum can be
applied to entire body surface [**Hospital1 **]-TID to help with healing.
Also, ABD pads or other cushioning in intertriginous areas to
prevent trauma as well as viscous lidocaine prn oral comfort.
She will need suture removal in [**10-17**] days and should follow up
at dermatology clinic. ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 1971**] to schedule a follow-up
appointment.)  The patient was also aggressively hydrated
because of the large volume of fluids that she is losing from
her skin.
.
# Bacteremia: Unclear etiology but likely pulmonary; from
previous admission.  The patient remained afebrile despite
growing [**3-7**] blood cultures for gram positive cocci in clusters
during that admission. TTE was performed at that time revealing
knwon stable AS with a thickened valve but no evidence of
vegetation.  The patient's vancomycin was stopped on admission
and she was started on Linezolid.  Repeat blood cultures are
pending at the time of discharge.  She will need a total of a 14
day course starting from [**9-7**] (ending on [**9-21**]).
