Hypertension urgency, Diabetic Ketoacidosis, Acute Diastolic CHF

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
30 year old Female who presents to the ED with worst headache of
her life, found to be having malignant hypertension with a [**First Name3 (LF) **]
pressure approximately 210/110. She was also noted with severe
hyperglycemia 383, rose 445 on arrival to the floor. She is also
noted in diastolic CHF with a markedly elevated BNP. She was
hypoxemic as well at 88% on room air.
.
The patient notes she has felt terrible for over a week, with
vomitting on the day of arrival and may have skipped 1-2 doses
of her insulin sliding scale as a result. She denies fever or
chills. She reports that her hypertension has been very
difficult to manage, recently seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] over at [**Last Name (un) **]
on [**7-8**], and her medications were adjusted. On morning of
admission her BP this AM was 211/110. She was driven to the ED
by her mother for her pounding frontal and left sided headache.
  Pt was hospitalized [**Date range (1) 36190**]/[**2150**] for viral meningitis but
reports resolution of her symptoms prior to this episode. She
notes a R hallux toenail fell off a few weeks ago but denies any
pain, redness or swelling. She she denies any other infectious
symptoms including fever, congestion, cough, SOB, dysuria, or
diarrhea.
  In the ED initial vital signs were 97.3 99 196/106 20 100%.
She was transiently triggered for hypoxia s/p receiving zofran
4mg, morphine 4mg, her sats was 88% on RA, which improved with
O2 to 98% on 2L. EKG showed nsr, no ST changes. Patient declined
LP, Ha resolved. Labs were notable Cr of 2.7 (baseline 1.3 in
[**3-/2150**]), proBNP: 8244, Hct: 28.3 (baseline), Trop-T: 0.07, Gluc
of 383, AGap=22. CT Head W/O Contrast negative for acute
intracranial process. CXR notable for fluid overload. Pt was
given zofran 8mg IV, reglan 10mg IV, Morphine Sulfate x1,
labetolol 20mg IV x2, hydral 10mg IV x 1, Lorazepam, Furosemide,
Aspirin 325mg, 10U SQ x1. Patient was admitted for HTN
urgency/emergency with hyperglycemia and transferred to the MICU
for insulin drip, HTN, and fluid management. Vital signs prior
to transfer 161/79 86 19 100%2L.
   In the ICU she was placed on insulin drip with normalization
of ion gap and was transitioned to her home glargine and ISS,
diabetic diet and D5 1/2NS+20K. She was seen by [**Last Name (un) **] this
morning who recommended q2-4h FSBG, home glargine 20U QAM and an
increased humalog sliding scale.
   Her [**Last Name (un) **] pressure was controlled on her home regimen with
goal BP in 140-150. Her lisinopril and furosemide were held in
the context of [**Last Name (un) **]. Her renal injury was treated with gentle
hydration and Cr remained stable. Her mild hypoxia in the ED
resolved in the MICU, patient was transferred to the floor on
room air. She was continued on all of her other home
medications.
