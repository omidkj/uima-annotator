cultures were positive for H. flu.  The patient was put on
Gatafloxacin on [**2159-7-31**].  The patient had multiple weaning
attempts until [**2159-8-11**] which were unsuccessful.  The patient
had a negative CTA examination, negative TTE.  On [**2159-8-11**],
the patient had an increased white blood cell count, febrile,
secondary to presumed line infection with culture-positive
gram-positive cocci or typed to be MRSA.  Vancomycin was
started.  The patient requested transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White blood cell count 26.2,

116.

Chest x-ray showing obscure right heart border, right
diaphragm, fluid in right fissure, patchy left lower lobe
atelectasis with left upper lobe opacity, ET tube, NG tube,
and a right IJ in good position.

EKG revealed normal sinus rate at 67, axis normal, intervals
normal, borderline LAE, TWI, ABL, V1, unchanged, C/W prior
ECGs.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Due to MRSA
pneumonia on top of COPD flare, MRSA pneumonia diagnosed at
an outside hospital on [**2159-8-12**] and left upper lobe treated
with multiple antibiotics including Zosyn started on
[**2159-8-20**], Levaquin, vancomycin, steroids were given for COPD
flare.  The patient was extubated on [**2159-8-21**] with multiple
desaturations secondary to mucous plugs.  The patient
underwent bronchoscopy which again noticed mucous plugs.  Was
treated with Mucomyst.  The patient was transferred to the
floor from the ICU on [**2159-8-30**] off all antibiotics and oral
steroids.  Continued on nebulizers and inhalers (Albuterol,
Atrovent, fluticasone).

On the floor, the patient used incentive spirometry.  The
patient continued to improve from a respiratory standpoint
and was discharged on 3 liters nasal cannula which she will
continue to use at rehabilitation and will continue to be
weaned from.

2.  DIABETES INSIPIDUS: The patient had been urinating a
large amount of hyperosmolar urine and when in the ICU the
patient developed hypernatremia while intubated.  Renal was
consulted and given laboratory data of a very dilute urine in
the setting of high serum osms and the patient's history of
greater than one gallon of water consumption a day.  The team
felt that the patient had an underlying diabetes insipidus.
The plan was to continue to allow the patient to have free
water access.  This resulted in resolution of her
hypernatremia.  The patient will be followed by the Renal
Service as an outpatient.

3.  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  The patient had a climbing
creatinine while in-house with a peak of 2.2.  This was
thought to be due to ATN secondary to high urinary output
with little fluid intake while intubated in the ICU.  Zosyn
was discontinued in case of possible AIN but no serum or
urine eosinophils were noted to suggest this diagnosis.  The
Renal Team were following and will follow the patient as an
outpatient.  Discharge creatinine was 1.9 and will be
followed as an outpatient.

4.  RIGHT HAND CELLULITIS:  Developed following peripheral IV
site infiltration.  Followed by Plastic Surgery in-house who
recommended antibacterial ointment q.d. with sterile dry
dressing changes q.d.  The patient will follow Plastics as an
outpatient.

5.  FEN/GI:  The patient cleared by Speech and Swallow for a
regular diet.

6.  DISORIENTATION/AGITATION:  Occurred while in the ICU,
treated with Haldol, Risperdal, and Zyprexa p.r.n.,
self-resolving.  Currently not on any medications.  Currently
oriented, likely ICU psychosis.

7.  DISPOSITION: The patient will he discharged to Health
Sound [**Hospital 38**] [**Hospital **] Hospital for further
management of respiratory function.  Will follow-up at the
clinics listed below.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation.
3.  Pneumonia with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus.
4.  Right hand cellulitis.
5.  Acute renal failure.
6.  Diabetes insipidus.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Albuterol nebulizer treatment q. four hours p.r.n.
2.  Atrovent nebulizer q. six hours, q. 2-4 hours p.r.n.
3.  fluticasone 110 micrograms inhaler two puffs b.i.d.
4.  Pantoprazole 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  MVI p.o. q.d.
