Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 330**]
Chief Complaint:
mental status changes, hypercarbic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
53F with ESRD on HD, CAD s/p CABG, HTN, DM type 2, PVD, presents
from [**Location (un) **] dialysis with decreased responsiveness. She is
reportedly drowsy at baseline and slept throughout her session.
At the end of dialysis, the ambulance personnel who arrived to
take her home were concerned for her increased lethargy and
brought her instead to [**Hospital1 18**] ED. VS stable in the field, 117/70,
HR 95, RR 20, glucose 189.
.
In the ED she was reportedly drowsy but somewhat combative. Her
ABG was consistent with hypercarbic respiratory failure
(7.27/77/31) and she was started on CPAP as she became more
somnolent. CXR showed moderate CHF. She received a head CT on
the way to the unit that was normal. On arrival to the MICU, her
ABG was 7.26/76/89 and she continued to be very somnolent,
almost unresponsive to voice or touch. She was then electively
intubated.
.
She was hospitalized in [**2166-8-24**] with a similar presentation
and her hypercapnea was thought to be secondary to COPD and
obesity hypoventilation. During her hospitalization she suffered
PEA arrest likely trigerred by worsening hypoxia of unclear
etiology. She was resuscitated after one round of epi and
atropine and intubated for a short period. She was extubated
without complication. CPAP was unsuccessful due to
claustrophobia.

7. Elevated LFTs, unknown etiology (?NASH)
8. CKD (type 4 RTA) on HD (TuThSa)
9. COPD

Social History:

alone. Her son lives in the same building. She smokes [**11-25**] ppd

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 53F w/ CAD s/p CABG, DM2, HTN, morbid obesity, CKD on HD
presents with hypercarbic respiratory failure
.
## hypercarbic respiratory failure: likely multifactorial
including contributions from COPD, obesity hypoventilation, OSA.
CXR showed moderate pulmonary edema although pt reportedly
completed HD session without incident.  She was intubated for
hypercarbic respiratory failure and improved quickly.  She was
extubated the following day without incident.  She maintained
good oxygen saturation and was more interactive post extubation.
 She was transferred to the floor but was noted to be lethargic
and was transferred to the MICU second time, by arrival to micu
she was back to her baseline.  She was encouraged to use bipap,
however patient refused. Around 1 AM [**2166-11-9**] patient demanded
to leave, she was told of the risk of leaving against medical
advise.  She expressed understanding of risks and potential
consequences of discharge and desired to be discharged anyway.
Patient signed a discharge AMA form.
.
## somnolence: likely from hypercarbic respiratory failure, had
extensive workup during last hospitalization that did not find
evidence of drug intoxication, sepsis, thyroid dysfunction. Head
CT negative.  Sepsis less likely given afebrile, WBC not
elevated.  Urine tox was positive for methadone and otherwise
negative.  Mental status improved post extubation and patient
more interactive.
.
# UTI - enterococus in urine sample, given ampicillin in the
hosptial and given a prescription for amoxicillin at time of
discharge.
.
## CKD: completed dialysis session on day of admission.  Whe was
dialysed on her usual cycle.
