History of Present Illness:
EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:
84 yo male with h/o HTN, CADs/p CABG was in his USOH until 48
hours ago when he started feeling weak and having dizziness.
Was seen at [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) **] and found to have HR in the 30s with a
junctional rhythm on EKG.  Was given atropine, and his HR
improved to 40. Found to have new onset renal failure cr 3.6 and
hyperkalemia (5.7) and was given Ca, dextrose, bicarb, insulin,
kayexalate and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED here, his HR was in the 40s and he felt better. No CP,
no SOB, no lightheadedness. SBP 140s. HR in upper 40s and lower
50s, Was given glucagon w/ GI upset but w/o improvement in HR.
EKG here w/ ? slow atrial fibrillation. Patient usually receives
lopressor 12.5 9 a.m. and cardizem 240mg XR 9 a.m.
.
The patient denies a change in urination, itchiness, but has had
trouble sleeping recently.  Also complains of sinus congestion
and HA for the last few weeks and a week of a nonproductive
cough.

.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. All of the other review
of systems were negative.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  He sleeps
with one pillow.

MEDICAL DECISION MAKING
EKG [**6-25**] - HR 50, irregular,
TELEMETRY demonstrated: bradycardia
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**10-27**] demonstrated:  EF 40-45%,
mild to moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with inferior/inferolateral/inferior akinesis.

.
LABORATORY DATA:
Na 14  K 4.9  Cl 109  Bicarb 24  BUN 69  Cr 3.6  Glu 155
WBC 8.7  Hct 30.0  Plt 201  (83.8% N, 11.6% L)
Pt 12.9  Ptt 25.8  INR 1.1
 Troponin  0.02

[**1-27**] CT abdomen:
- Cystic renal cell carcinoma left kidney, likely high-grade
papillary type. This has grown since [**2192**].
- Multiple left lower lobe nodules (in the lungs) are new since
[**2197-1-13**]. Though the largest has an appearance concerning for
metastasis, this would be unlikely to have grown to 1 cm in this
short interval and this may represent a small airways infection
or
aspiration as is evident in the right middle lobe.
.
[**6-25**] CXR mild interstital fluid overload without evidence of PNA
or pleural effusion.

.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
84 yo male with pmh of CAD s/p CABG, htn, and renal and
pulmonary masses who presents with ARF and a juntional
bradycardia.
.
#. CAD  - patient is s/p CABG, currently without chest pain.
- Continue ASA, statin.
- Are holding B-blocker due to bradycardia.
.
#. Pump  - patient has some signs of volume overload - crackles
halfway up his chest and interstial fluid on CXR.  Will monitor
and watch his I/Os as he is in renal failure and may become
volume overloaded.
- We will continue BP control with norvasc, but are holding
metoprolol and diltiazem as he is bradycardic.  Can consider
starting hydralazine if further BP control is needed.
.
#. Rhythm  - patient is currently in a juntional escape rhythm
likely due to his ARF as diltiazem is renally cleared and may be
accumulating causing AV block.
- Continue to monitor on telemetry
- Hold his B-blocker and diltiazem
.
#. Acute renal failure - Differential includes prerenal vs
intrarenal vs postrenal.  Unlikey to be prerenal as there is no
history to suggest volume depletion.  As for postrenal, he has a
history of RCC which could have metastasized or he may have BPH
which could have caused obstruction.  Intrarenal causes included
extension of his RCC, intrinsic golmerular disease, or
interstitial disease.
-  Renal US to rule out obstruction
-  F/U urinary electrolytes and [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
-  F/U UA amd UCx
-  Consider CT abd/ pelvis to evaluate renal mass
.
#  Kidney/ lung masses - last CT abd was in [**1-27**]
-  Consider CT abd/ pelvis to evaluate renal mass
.
#  Wheezing - patient has crackles and interstial fluid on CXR
- albuterol nebs prn
- Will monitor respiratory status
.
#  Hx of diarrhea and bowel obstruction - continue home PPI,
ranitidine and miralax.
- As the patient is very gassy, will give simethicone prn
.
#  Sinus problems - continue zyrtec and nasonex
.
#. FEN: Follow and replete electrolytes. Cardiac diet. No IVF at
present.
.
#. Access:  PIV
.
#. PPx: SQH, bowel regimen.
.
#. Code: full
.
#. Dispo:  pending resolution of his junctional rhythm and
diagnosis of the cause of his ARF
