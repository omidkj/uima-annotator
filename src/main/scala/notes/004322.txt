Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 19017**] is a 68yo gentleman with h/o HTN and severe COPD on
4L of oxygen presenting with chest pain.
.
The patient describes substernal chest pain "like pins and
needles" over the last two days with minimal exertion, such as
getting up out of bed. Last night, he began having chest pain at
rest. Pain was associated with diaphoresis and shortness of
[**Known lastname 1440**] (above his baseline). It was not radiating. He took a
sublingual NTG with temporary relief of the pain. Although he
reports having heart attacks in the past, he is not sure if his
current symptoms are similar to his prior events. He felt warm
two days ago but did not check his temperature. No cough,
myalgias, or congestion.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.4 90 77/46 16 90%. By the time he
arrived in the ED, chest pain had resolved. Guaiac was negative.
EKG showed RBBB without significant change from prior; cardiac
enzymes were negative. A CTA of the chest was negative for
dissection. IV fluids were given with improvement in his blood
pressure, although his pressures continued to be somewhat
labile. He received a dose of ASA as well as vanc and zosyn for
possible pneumonia. Just prior to leaving the ED, he was given
stress dose steroids because of hypotension in the setting of
chronic prednisone use. He was incidentally found to have a
laceration of his hand and a tetanus shot was given.

Imaging:
CXR:
PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST: The hilar and
cardiomediastinal contours are stable although prominent main
pulmonary
arteries bilaterally suggest pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Aorta is
tortuous. The lungs are clear with no focal consolidation,
pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Atelectatic changes of the
right lung base has improved.  There is hyperinflation of both
lungs with flattening of the diaphragm suggesting obstructive
pulmonary disease.
.
CTA:
1. Interval progression in degree of lower lobe bronchiectasis
with increased bronchial wall thickening, right lower lobe
ground-glass opacity, and fibrotic-type changes involving the
right lower lobe which all likely represent sequelae of acute on
chronic recurrent aspiration and/or infectious bronchiolitis. No
evidence of aortic dissection.
2. Unchanged diffuse emphysema with probable underlying
pulmonary arterial
hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 68yo gentleman with severe COPD on home oxygen and history
of MI with clean cath in [**2103**] presenting with chest pain.
.
# COPD exacerbation:  Ruled out for MI given reported chest pain
and CTPA without dissection or PE.  Responded to doubling of his
steroid and azithromycin for 5 day course.
.
# Hand laceration:  Confirmed with ED staff, there was no
indication for stitches. Pt has steri strips in place.  These
were replaced once during admission for partial dislodgement.
There was no erythema or inflammation or pain to suggest hand
infection.  He was instructed to return to the ED if
pain/redness/fever develop.  He received tetanus vaccine in ED.

.
# Chronic low back pain:
- continued home percocet, MS contin low dose added with good
effect.
