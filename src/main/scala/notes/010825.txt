.
head CT:
1. No evidence of hemorrhage.
2. Hypodensity of the cerebral periventricular white matter,
particularly adjacent to the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the right lateral
ventricle. This could represent chronic microvascular ischemia.
.
head MRI: Focal area of T2 hyperintense signal involving the
right posterior periventricular white matter suggestive of
chronic microvascular ischemic or gliotic changes. Correlation
with gadolinium-enhanced images would be recommended for further
evaluation. It should be noted that the patient refused the
administration of gadolinium near the termination of the exam
and requested to leave the radiology department. There are no
acute territorial infarcts seen on diffusion images. Followup is
suggested.
.
colonoscopy: Polyps in the ascending colon (polypectomy)
Diverticulosis of the ascending colon, transverse colon and
descending colon
Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum.
Should have routine capsule study & repeat colonoscopy in 3
years pending histology. Bright blood probably diverticular
bleed.
.
EGD:
Esophagus: Normal esophagus.
Stomach: Normal stomach.
Duodenum: Normal duodenum.
.
Echo: EF>55%. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global  and regional biventricular systolic function.
Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mildly
dilated aortic arch.
.
RLE USN: Nonocclusive, probably subacute right popliteal DVT.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 77M with h/o HTN who p/w GI bleed found to be unsafe to d/c
home so awaiting guardianship.
.
# Cognitive status- The patient presented with poor baseline
cognitive ability. His wife had been the primary caretaker. As
she had recently passed away, there was concern that the patient
would not be able to successfully manage independant living. A
psych consult was requested for evaluation of the patient's
ability to take care of himself. Neuropsych testing documented
cognitive impairment NOS. The examiner was concerned that Mr.
[**Known lastname 9733**] cognitive limitations would limit his ability to
live independantly. He was seen again on [**3-23**] by psychiatry who
felt the patient had significant problems with learning and
shifting cognitive sets, and based on this since his wife was
the primary caretaker, it was felt Mr. [**Known lastname **] would not be
able to safely function independently on his own.  The primary
doctor for the patient was also contact[**Name (NI) **] and felt the patient
would have trouble caring for himself.  Both social work and
legal services were involved in obtaining guardianship for this
patient and placement for this patient.
.
# GI bleed - The patient was admitted to the MICU with a HCT 19
where he was transfused a total of 6 units. His hct was stable
at 31. The patient underwent EGD and colonoscopy by GI. The EGD
ruled out an upper GI bleed, while the colonoscopy demonstrated
3 polyps (nonbleeding) which were removed, diverticulosis, and
grade I internal hemorrhoids. Therefore, the BRBPR was
attributed to diverticulosis. The pathology on the excised
polyps came back as adenoma. A repeat colonoscopy was
recommended in three years. A capsule study was also recommended
and was done as an inpatient. The patient was transferred to the
floor and his Hct remained stable.  His capsule study is still
pending and should be followed as an outpatient.
.
# Lower extremity edema: The patient has a history of lower
extremity edema.  He had no history of gout and no evidence of
changes.  This was followed and remained fairly stable with
lasix, TEDS, low salt diet and leg elevation.
.
# Hypertension - The patient's BP was controlled with Lisinopril
and metoprolol.
.
# Right popliteal DVT-  On [**3-7**] the patient chronically
edemetous LEs appeared asymetric. A LE USN of the RLE showed a
subacute DVT, partially re-canalized. He was started on coumadin
and bridged with heparin until therapuetic. The patient will
need to remain on coumadin for 6 months with weekly INR checks.
His last INR was 2.6 on [**4-2**] and at that time he was on coumadin
5mg Qhs alternating with 2.5 mg (on mon/weds/fri).  He had
previously been on 5 mg qhs, but was slightly supratherapeutic
and has been stable on the 5 mg and 2.5 mg regimen.  His next
Inr should be checked on [**4-9**] and needs to be checked weekly.
The patient may need a full hypercoagulable work-up in the
future by his primary doctor.
.
# SVT: The patient had one episode of symptomatic SVT with a P
160, likely AVNRT. He complained of "heartburn and mild
dyspnea". The SVT broke immediately with carotid massage and the
patient's symptoms resolved. He was started on metoprolol and
this was titrated up to 25mg [**Hospital1 **]. He had no recurrent episodes.
.
# GERD: The patient was started on protonix per his request for
heartburn with good symptom control.
.
# Right medial buttock furuncle- The patient was noted to have a
right buttock furuncle, and should continue warm compresses, and
neosporin with daily dry dressing changes, until his lesion is
fully healed.
.
# Weight loss - The patient had mentioned a > 60 lbs weight loss
over past year, but no further information was able to be
obtained.  A full outpatient work-up should be considered, and a
cancer screen may be necessary.
