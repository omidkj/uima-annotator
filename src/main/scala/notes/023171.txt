Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:66 yo female with HTN, kidney stones, UTIs presents with RLL
infiltrate/R flank pain transferred to MICU for
hypoxia/hypotension.
.
# PNA/Hypoxia: The patient was intially admitted to the floor
and started on Ceftriaxone and Vancomycin. The pneumonia was
likely the cause of her R flank pain by regional irritation.
However, the patien was transferred to the MICU because she had
some hypoxia and hypotension.  In the MICu, she was given an
additional 1gm of CTX and 1gm of vancomycin to cover possible
community acquired MRSA. Her hypoxia improved and did not
require any intubation or non-invasives. Her O2 was weaned to NC
and at the time of c/o to the floor, her O2 sat is 92-95L on 4L.
On right lateral decub film, she has a small effusion that was
felt to too small to tap. Given how clinically stable she was,
she was transferred back out to the floor.  Sputum cultures were
sent and were contamined, legionella was negative. Blood
cultures had no growth.  The patient was continued on IV
Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin.  IV Vanc was
dicontinued on [**10-30**].  She was subsequently changed to oral
antibiotics upon discharge as she continued to improve.
.
# Hypotension: On the floor, patient had hypotensive episode
which was initially was concerning for sepsis/shock in the
setting of PNA. Pt responded to 500cc of NS bolus and her MAP
remained >65. She was transferred to the MICu.  She was given
additional 1L NS.  All her antihypertensives were held. At time
of call-out of MICU, SBP 120-140s. She had no further episodes
of hypotension, and in fact her systolic was 150-160s on the
floor; her atenolol was restarted.
.
# Anemia: Her initial admission hct was 41. Her hct dropped to
31.9. Pt only received a total of 2L NS (1L in ED and 1L here in
MICU). Likely [**1-13**] bone marrow suppression from pretty severe
pneumonia. Her guaiac is negative and her repeat hct was 33.1
which is stable. It continued to rise and remained stable
throughout her stay.
.
# History of Compression fx: Patient was continued on actonel
and Ca/Vitamin D supplements.
.
# GERD: Prilosec was held and Protonix given in house.  This was
changed back to her home prilosec on discharge.
