History of Present Illness:
57 year-old woman with [**Last Name (un) 24206**] [**Last Name (un) 24206**], CAD s/p cabg and stents, PVD
presented with chest pain. She initially presented to [**Hospital 107**]
Hospital on [**1-13**] with chest pain and was found to have a Tn of
0.23; however, as at the time she only was felt to have ST
elevations in v3, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] as an NSTEMI.
Once here, she was found to have a temp of 97.1, bp 137/92, hr
95, rr 16, spo2 97% on 2L nc. Her first set of labs was not
significantly different, but her ecg now showed st elevations
v2-v5 (2-3mm). In the ED, she was continued on IV heparin and
nitro drip. She also received Plavix 600mg po and metoprolol 5mg
IV x 3, morphine 4mg IV. She was emergently rushed to the cath
lab where during the intervention she became hypotensive, so an
IABP was placed. Norepi and dopa were started. She arrested once
and was intubated and cardioverted back to a NSR; she arrested a
second time (VF) and was again cardioverted.

Pertinent Results:
[**2152-1-13**] CXR: IMPRESSION: Mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
Small left-sided pleural effusion and left lower lobe opacity
which could be atelectasis or pneumonia.
.
[**2152-1-13**] Cath:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Cardiogenic shock managed with IABP and Vaso pressors.
3. Cardiac arrest; pulseless electrical activity followed by
ventricular
fibrillation.
4. PCI of the SVG-->LAD.
5. Attempted PCI of the LCx.
.
[**2152-1-14**] ECHO: LVEF 20% Impression: extensive anteroseptal
infarct, with multiple wall motion abnormalities consistent with
multiple vessel obstructive coronary artery disease; probable
apical thrombus
.
[**2152-1-15**] EEG: IMPRESSION: This is an likely normal EEG in the
waking and drowsy states. The generalized beta activity is most
commonly due to
medication effect. No focal, lateralizing or epileptiform
features were
noted.
.
[**2151-1-21**] ECHO: Compared with the findings of the prior study
(images reviewed) of [**2151-1-14**], the mitral regurgitation
is worse; the apical echodensity previously noted is no longer
seen.
.
[**2151-1-27**] ECHO:
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2151-1-21**], there is less mitral regurgitation seen. Overall EF
unchanged (20-25%).
.
[**2151-2-5**] CXR: CHEST AP: There is no interval change in mild
interstitial edema. The mediastinal, hilar contours, and heart
size are unremarkable. Mediastinal sutures and cardiovascular
clips are in place. No consolidation present.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old female with moyamoya, h/o stroke, CAD
s/p CABG, PVD who presented with a STEMI from cath lab; arrived
intubated, with intraaortic balloon pump and triple pressors.
She was stable but in critical condition. She was weened off of
pressors and the IABP was discontinued.  The following is a
brief summary of her hospital course by problem list.
.
#STEMI -- She presented with a massive STEMI and went to the
cath lab.  SHe had a stent placed to the LAD, and a failed OM
stent. CK peaked at 4959. Currently getting medical management
with asa, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, lisinopril.
She has had complications with MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 24207**] since the STEMI as
noted below.
.
# CHF -- Her CHF was new and secondary to her massive STEMI. She
was revascularized at cath lab and had two cardiac arrests as
described in the HPI.  She was intubated and placed on an IABP
and pressors for support.  Her admit Echo showed an LV thrombis
of 1.6 x 1.6 cm, EF of 20%, severe hypokinesis of the anterior
septum and anterior free wall, with extensive apical akinesis
and focal dyskinesis. The posterior wall is severely
hypokinetic, no VST, 3+ MR. She developed significant pulmonary
edema secondary to her severe MR.  She was diuresed aggressively
while maintaining her BP with the IABP and pressors.  She was
slowly weened off of pressors and the IABP was discontinued.
She was extubated. A repeat ECHO showed some improvement with
decreased MR (2+) with EF still 20-25%.  She subsequently had
episode of hypotension which was treated with dopamine, but
discontinued shortly thereafter.  The hypotension was thought to
be related to overdiuresis and high dose medications.  Her BP
medications have been adjusted to optimize her mortality and
morbidity while maintaining her BP.  She was discharged on
lisinopril 5mg, toprol XL 12.5mg, furosemide 40mg. SHe was
euvolemic at discharge. Of note, her SBP tends to run in the
90's which is not surprising given her cardiac function and low
EF.  She remains asymptomatic from it.
.
# Rhythm: She was monitored on telemetry throughout her
hospitalization and had frequent [**Last Name (Titles) 24207**] especially sensitive to
hypokalemia.  She has had runs of NSVT at both slow and fast
rates.  The electrophysiology team was consulted regarding
possible ICD placement. They felt as though she may recover some
of her heart function and they request a repeat ECHO 2 weeks
from discharge. If her LVEF is still less than 30%, they will
consider placing an ICD as a preventative measure.
.
# Neuro: After her massive STEMI and cardiac arrests, neurology
was consulted to evaluate her brain function.  An EEG suggested
normal function immediately after the events.  She is followed
as an outpatient by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1693**] for her h/o of CVA x 2 with
baseline RUE hyperreflexia and aphasia.  Through her
hospitalization, she improved especially s/p extubation and
neurology felt she had returned to her baseline neurologic
function.
.
# ARF: She had some rise in her Cr during her hospitalization
which was thought to be likely prerenal from hypovolemia.  Her
peak Cr was 1.8, but this has resolved and was around 1 on
discharge.  This is still elevated compared to her admission Cr,
but that may be secondary to the ACEI which is needed for her
cardiac function.  Her Cr should be monitored along with her
electrolytes every Mon, Wed, Fri.
.
# LV thrombis: Her first ECHO post MI showed an LV thrombis. She
was started on heparin gtt for this.  Repeat ECHOs have not
shown the thrombus, but she should probably remain
anticoagulated as a LV aneurysm was also seen.  She is being
discharged on coum
