Chief Complaint:
Confusion, shortness of breath, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6352**] is an 89 YO male with HTN and mild dementia at
baseline, who presented with delirium, shortness of breath, and
cough. His cough was present for one week prior to presentation
and was productive of a clear sputum. At home his temperature
was 102.2 degrees F on the morning of admission, according to
his home health aide. He also complained of generalized
weakness.   His home health aide reported that he had not been
himself for the several days PTA as he has been increasingly
confused and not able to complete his ADLs.  At baseline, he
pays his own bills and keeps up with the daily stock report.

In the ED T 98.1, HR 86, BP 120/84, RR 28-30, O2 Sat 97% 2L NC.
He received tylenol 650 mg PO at 6 AM.  Levofloxacin 750 mg IV
was given in the ED for a presumed PNA and blood cultures were
sent. He was stable and tranferred to the floor.

IMAGING:
[**2-27**] CT Head: No evidence of infarction or hemorrhage.
[**2-27**] CXR PA and lateral: No focal consolidation to suggest
pneumonia.
[**3-2**] CXR Portable:  In comparison with the study of [**2-28**], focal
areas of opacification
adjacent to the aortic arch, in the left lower lung zone and at
the right
base.  This raises the possibility of multiple areas of
pneumonia, though some
of this apparent change may reflect differences in technique.
The possibility
of a central source of infection must be considered and
echocardiography could
be helpful.

[**2163-3-7**] TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild-moderate regional
dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the apical half of the
septum, anterior, apical and lateral walls. Basal segments
contract best (LVEF = 40-45%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mitral regurgitation is
present but cannot be quantified. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.  Compared with the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2162-7-15**], regional left ventricular hypokinesis is
now identified (and the severity of mitral regurgitation is not
as well characterized).

[**3-9**] CTA Chest:
1.  No central pulmonary embolism.  Evaluation of distal
pulmonary artery
branches is limited by respiratory motion artifact.
2.  Findings suggestive of CHF versus fluid overload.
3.  Extensive peripheral ground-glass opacities, most prominent
in the upper
lobes with areas of honeycombing.  These findings may be related
to chronic
interstitial process/pulmonary fibrosis.  However, a more acute
superimposed
process such as viral or atypical pneumonia cannot be excluded.
4. Nodular opacities in the right middle lobe which may be
infectious in
etiology.
5. Pleural calcifications suggesting asbestos-related pleural
disease.
6. Subacute rib fractures involving multiple posterior ribs.
Additional old
healed fractures of several right lateral ribs.
7. Several thoracic compression fractures of indeterminate age.
8. Cardiomegaly.  Reflux of contrast into the hepatic veins
suggestive of
right- sided heart failure.
9. Small pericardial effusion.


EKG:Resting sinus tachycardia. Left atrial abnormality. Possible
left ventricular
hypertrophy. Borderline intraventricular conduction delay.
Non-specific
ST-T wave changes. P-R interval at the upper limits of normal.
Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2162-7-13**] heart rate is faster.

Brief Hospital Course:
INFLUENZA A and PNEUMONIA:
The patient was intially on the [**Hospital1 139**] service, as an admission
for influenza A and pneumonia. In the ED, he was evaluated with
EKG, CXR, CT head, and labs.  He was initially treated with
levaquin and standing nebulizer treatments, and was sent to the
floor for management and observation.   He also received a five
day course of Tamiflu 75 mg PO BID.

On [**3-2**] a floor trigger was called for SOB, hypoxia and
increased work of breathing. He O2 sat was found to be in the
mid 80s on room air and he was tachypneic to the mid 30's;
oxygenation improved to 96% on NRB with abg of 7.38/45/81.   CXR
from [**3-2**] was not significantly different from admission with
fluffy basilar predominant infiltrates. He was transferred to
the MICU.

On [**3-3**], he had been improving with stable sats; he was afebrile
and had a decreased WBC, so he was transferred out to the floor
again.

His influenza course was thought to be superimposed with a
bacterial pneumonia, as he had persistent temperatures,
respiratory distress and worsening infiltrates on CXR .  He also
had worsening secretions, which he had difficulty clearing
without aggressive suctioning, causing occasional hypoxia. He
was started on vancomycin and zosyn on [**3-5**], and was completed on
a 10 day course to treat the pneumonia.  At the time of
discharge, he was afebrile, but had persistent secretions that
needed to be managed with frequent suctioning.

Mr. [**Known lastname 6352**] was noted to have an elevated troponin and BNP in the
setting of acute lung injury.  He had frequent ectopy; aspirin
was started and he was maintained on is home dose of metoprolol
25 mg PO BID.

SPEECH and SWALLOW EVALUATION:
Although he was admitted on a regular PO diet, Mr. [**Known lastname 6352**] failed
a speech and swallow evaluation and was made NPO.  A Dobhoff
tube was placed and he was started on tube feeds.  It is hoped
that after he recovers from his acute illness, he
