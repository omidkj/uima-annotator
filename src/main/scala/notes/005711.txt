CHIEF COMPLAINT: bradycardia post-DCCV

cardioversion

History of Present Illness:
EVENTS / HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  58 year old man with
myotonic dystrophy, non ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 30-35% and
chronic AFib since '[**64**] presented for outpt cardioversion and
developed bradycardia and junctional escape rhythm post DCCV.
The patient was recently referred to the EP service for a second
opinion to evaluate for possible ICD placement for the primary
prevention of sudden cardiac death.  It was felt that his LV
function might improve if sinus rhythm was restored, and plan to
hold off on ICD.  Patient was recently started on amiodarone in
[**Month (only) 116**] in preparation for DCCV.  Apparently DCCV was attempted in
the past, but was unsuccessful and it is unclear whether he had
previously been on antiarrhythmics.  During EP procedure, 200J
biphasic shock was delivered and patient converted to junctional
rhythm, bradycardic with sbp 60's.  He was given atropine x 2
and 0.5mg epinephrine.  He was then started on a dopamine drip
while converting from sinus bradycardia to junctional rhythm.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cough,
shortness of breath, fevers and he refused to answer additional
questions. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest
pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.  Patient has a history of NY Heart Association Class
II-III heart failure symptoms including dyspnea with carrying
groceries, walking up one flight of stairs, has one pillow
orthopnea, and lower extremity edema.  He denies any exertional
or non-exertional chest pain.

Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, patient is a 59 year old male with myotonic
dystrophy, non ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 30-35% and chronic
AFib developed bradycardia and junctional escape rhythm post
DCCV

Rhythm.  Pt was admitted with a junctional escape rhythm and
sinus bradycardia post DCCV (likely from prolonged effects on
sinus node).  He was treated with dopamine overnight to keep
blood pressures up, which was promptly weaned.  Anticoagulation
with coumadin was held temporarily due to a supratherapeutic INR
of 4.  INR was rechecked and 2.2 on [**2172-8-10**], the day of
discharge and coumadin to be restarted on the evening of
[**2172-8-10**].  Amioadarone and other nodal agents were held.
Telemetry showed that he was did not revert to A.Fib during CCU
stay.

He will go home with [**Doctor Last Name **] of hearts Monitor with once daily
transmission for one week.  He will then call Dr.[**Name (NI) 7914**]
office before starting on Quinidine three times daily for the
remaining 2 weeks of monitoring.  During that time he will
continue to have daily transmissions on the [**Doctor Last Name **] of Hearts
monitor. He will follow up with cardiology in 2 - 3 weeks.  His
Amiodarone was discontinued.  He will be sent home on his home
dose of Lisinopril and Aldactone, and well as a lower dose of
Toprol XL at 25mg daily.

Pump.  Patient is known to have an EF of 30-35%.  DCCV was
performed to see if reestablishing sinus rhythm would help
patient regain cardiac function, prior to evaluation for
possible ICD placement.  On arrival to the CCU, he appeared
volume overloaded, so he was given lasix 20mg iv x 1. Over the
remainder of his hospital stay his pulmonary edema improved
significantly, and he maintained normal sinus rhythm.

CAD.  No known CAD on cardiac cath.

HTN.  His outpatient anti-hypertensives (ACEI, beta-blocker)
were intially held and then restarted one day prior to discharge
and maintained normal blood pressure and heart rate. Toprol XL
was decreased in dose to 25mg daily.

Dispo.  Physical therapy consulted on patient and recommended
rehab.  The patient's coumadin is to be restarted on [**2172-8-10**] as
his INR was 2.2 on this date.  He is to continue his home dosage
of coumadin 2.5mg PO 5 days a week and coumadin [**1-28**] tab
Wednesday and Friday.  He is to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as
above.
