Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p PEA arrest/cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cooling protocol

History of Present Illness:
82M with h/o CABG 7 yrs ago, s/p ICD ([**Hospital3 **]) for ?CHF (5yrs
ago), afib on coumadin, COPD with baseline SOB, presented with
acute dyspnea and found to be in respiratory distress overnight
on Am on [**7-29**] around 1-1:30am with syncope/collapse onto soft
couch. CPR started within 5-10 minutes of patient being found
down. First rhythm was PEA, was in agonal breathing, regained
pulse s/p epi, atropine, and intubation. Sent to OSH (arrived
2:55am), per OSH, had pulse but lost pulse around 3:15am,
patient given epi, atropine, heparin bolus and gtt, then
regained pulse with v-pacing so cooling protocol started
(patient down to 30 degrees). Possible report that ICD fired
twice - then was V-paced, got bolus/gtt of amiodarone, 20mcg of
dopa, 2L IVF, CK and trop flat, INR therapeutic, sent to [**Hospital1 18**].

.
Arrived at [**Hospital1 18**] ED around 5:20am, initial 31.4 R, 66, 80/37,
22, 88% of FiO2 100, PEEP 5, PiP 44. ECG showing wide right
bundle with possible complete heart block. Found to have small R
apical pneumothorax s/p R chest tube but not large enough to be
culprit for causing . RIJ, PIVs placed. Bedside ECHO showed no
pericardial effusion, ventricles beating. On cooling protocol.
Kept on amio gtt, started max dopa (20mcg), levophed (0.12). K
was high, given calcium, bicarb. Vitals on transfer were T30.8
(getting 1L warm saline fluid, warming blankets), 72, 132/56,
95% FiO2 60, RR18 - 60, PEEP 6, peak P 36, TV 400. CVP 17. ABG
on transfer was 7/15/64/555
.
On arrival to CCU, patient was unresponsive, not withdrawing to
any noxious stimulation. Patient was transferred on amiodarone
gtt at 1, levophed at 0.14, and dopamine at 20 weaned down to
10.

Brief Hospital Course:
# s/p cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology which prompted initial
PEA arrest. No anticedent illness. No e/o ischemia on EKG.
Anticoagulated so unlikely to be PE & no e/o EKG. Small R-sided
pneumothorax with no e/o tension prior to arrival. No e/o
hypovolemia. With profound acidosis. Thus, unclear but
potentially primary cardiac vs pulmonary source.
Patient underwent cooling protocol. The cardiac arrest team,
including neuro, was involved. Patient was monitored on
continuous 48hr bedside EEG per protocol. EEG on [**2159-7-30**] showed
some higher amplitude spikes, but since early morning of [**2159-7-31**],
EEG was flatline. Neuro felt that there was very little hope of
significant recovery of brain function. Patient also continued
to require moderately high doses of levophed and dopamine to
maintain blood pressure.
Family meeting was held [**2159-7-31**] with CCU team, neurology consult,
SW. Family agreed that CMO would be in line with patient's
wishes. Patient was extubated and all medications stopped.
Patient received morphine prn for comfort.
.
# Respiratory failure: s/p intubation initially difficult to
ventilate with high auto PEEP, PIP. Patient with h/o asthma and
concern for bronchospasm on exam. No h/o COPD per available
records. Patient received Albuterol / Ipratroprium nebs prn,
daily CXR were followed.
.
# CORONARIES: h/o CAD s/p CABG. No localized ischemia on ECGs,
no elevation in enzymes.

# PUMP: No prior records in our system, family cannot relay any
clear details.
.
# RHYTHM: V-paced, pacer interrogated showing oversensitivity
leading to 2 episodes of inappropriate ICD firing at OSH, none
since. Patient therapeutic on prior coumadin.  Patient was
monitored on telemetry.
