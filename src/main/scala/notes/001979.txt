Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
ICD firing

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pacer interrogation
Cardiac catheterization (no intervention)
Central venous line placement in Coronary Care Unit


History of Present Illness:
57 yo M with non-ischemic dilated CMP (EF 20% in [**2-10**] with 4+
MR) secondary to Chagas disease, s/p PPM-ICD for cardiac arrest
[**2127**], multiple ED evaluations for orthostasis, presenting s/p
ICD discharges on [**12-27**] and [**12-29**]. Both shocks were preceded by
prodrome of dizziness without chest pain, palpitations, or SOB,
or syncopal event, and was shocked once. EP evaluation on [**12-27**]
revealed appropriate VT therapy on both occasions. On [**12-27**],
amiodarone was increased from 200 mg QD to 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] x2 weeks
for reloading. EP also adjusted anti-tachycardia pacing
threshold and RV pacing output (given increase in threshold).
Has not had ICD firing prior to these events since implant, but
has had ? regular fast palpitations in chest over past 2 weeks.
On ROS, only other symptom noted was recent URI, for which he
started started Zithromax on [**2131-12-28**].

ECHO [**2131-12-31**]-
Conclusions:
===========
1. The left atrium is elongated. LA 6.6 cm.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated (diastolic dimension
8.9cm). Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (EF 15-20%). Resting regional wall motion
abnormalities include lateral, inferolateral and apical
akinesis. The remaining left ventricular segments are
hypokinetic.
3.Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function is normal.
4.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Severe (4+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5.There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
6.There is no pericardial effusion.
7. There is an echogenic density in the right ventricle
consistent with an AICD.
.
CXR [**2131-12-30**]
===========
There is a dual lead left-sided pacemaker, unchanged in
position. There is a new right-sided IJ central venous catheter
with the distal tip in the proximal right atrium. No
pneumothoraces are identified. There is marked cardiomegaly
which is unchanged. There has been interval increase in the
pulmonary vascular markings consistent with edema. There is
again seen a linear density within the right mid lung zone which
may represent atelectasis or scarring. This is unchanged. The
left CP angle has been cut off from the study. There is some
mild elevation of the right hemi-diaphragm and blunting of the
right CP angle which may be secondary to atelectasis, scarring,
or pleural fluid

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography revealed a right dominant
system with
minimal luminal irregularities. The LMCA had mild plaquing up to
20%.
The LAD had minimal luminal irregularities with a distal
myocardial
"bridge" with systolic compression. The apical LAD wrapped well
around
the apex.  The LCx had minimal luminal irregularities.  The RCA
had
minimal luminal irregularities, it had a twin distal system with
rPDA
and RPL.
2. Hemodynamics demonstrated severely elevated left and right
heart
filling pressures, severely elevated pulmonary artery pressures
and
large V waves on the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Cardiac
index
was depressed.  The arterial waveform demonstrated narrow pulse
pressure
with low normal systolic systemic arterial pressure. There was
no
gradient across the aortic valve on pull-back of the catheter
from the
LV to the aorta.
3. Left ventriculography was not done as the filling pressures
were too
elevated.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Severe mitral regurgitation.
3. Severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2131-12-29**] andk initially
underwent device interrogation by EP, followed by IV amiodarone
loading over 24 hours. He subsequently experienced two episodes
of VT/VF the night during amiodarone loading at 12:30, then
subsequently at 7:30 the following morning, 30 min after IV
amiodarone was completed. Anti-tachycardia pacing failed on both
attempts and he was shocked into SR. Lidocaine was initiated
with 100mg bolus and 1mg/min maintenance infusion. He was
transitioned to oral mexilitine. One hour following mexilitine
dose, pt was found by care assistant c/o SOB, nausea,
