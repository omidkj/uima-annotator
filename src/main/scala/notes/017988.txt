History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 13144**] is an 82 yo F w/h/o stroke, CAD w/ stents, and
diverticulosis, who presented for BRBPR.  She was in her USOH
until this afternoon at 12:30 pm when she developed painless,
BRBPR of uncertain volume.  She denied abd pain, N/V, F/C,
cramping, diarrhea/constipation and CP/SOB.  She went to the
[**Location (un) 620**] ED where Hct was 35.2; she received 1L NC and nexium 20
mg IV x 1.  She was then then was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care (specifically for angiography back-up
capabilities).
.
Of note, she has had one prior episode of painless BRBPR in
[**4-/2161**] for which she presented to [**Location (un) 620**] and had a colonoscoy.
No source was identified: she was given supportive care with
some RBC transfusions (though unclear how many; sounds like one)
and she was discharged to a rehab facility.  She also had a
single polyp identified on colonoscopy which was not removed at
the time.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, VS were HR 104, BP 84/60, RR 22, 100% 2L NC.
She was given 2 units RBC and 1 L NS for resuscitation.  NG
lavage was negative.  The ED team spoke with GI who suggested a
RBC scan if she opens up again; she has not been seen yet by GI.
 She has not had any more episodes since the ambulance ride from
[**Location (un) 620**]; Hct was 35.2 on d/c from [**Location (un) 620**] and then 30.8 on
arrival here.  Baseline Hct is uncertain.

[**2161-6-9**] Colonoscopy)  Diverticulosis of sigmoid and descending
colon, otherwise nml colonoscopy.


Brief Hospital Course:
82 yo F with diverticulosis, COPD, CAD on plavix/ASA at the time
of admission presented with painless BRBPR.
.
#. LGIB: Most likely diverticular given painless nature and
prior history. She had no further episodes since the early
evening after arriving at [**Hospital1 18**].  In the ED, 2 units pRBC and 1L
NS were administered and patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
On arriving at the [**Name (NI) 153**] pt was hemodynamically stable. The
decision was made to hold home antihypertensives and asa, plavix
therapy. Pts hct was monitored overnight with no need for
additional transfusions.  In the morning GI was consulted.
Colonoscopy was scheduled for the following morning which
revealed diverticulosis of sigmoid and descending colon,
otherwise normal, no evidence of active bleeding.
Given history of two significant GI bleeds in the past month,
patient's aspirin and plavix were held. Of note, pt has hx of
drug-eluting coronary stents placed in [**2156**], anterior MI and
CVA.  She has strong indications for those meds, but given
recent life-threatening GI bleed and from discussion with pt,
her greatest current concern is recurrent GI bleed and she
agrees with plan to hold ASA and plavix. At PCP f/u,
re-evaluation rsik/benefit for aspirin and plavix should be
made.

# CAD: Pt denies and chest pain or cardiac symptoms. CE were
negative.

#. HTN: Pt was hypotensive on admission. Blood pressure
normalized. Restarted home emds after colonoscopy.
