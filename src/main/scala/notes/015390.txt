Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4057**]
Chief Complaint:
right mainstem obstructive mass

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**8-21**] flex bronch: RMS bronchus obstruction secondary to
intrinsic compression
[**8-22**]- rigid bronchoscopy, tissue biopsy, airway dilitation,
stent placement


History of Present Illness:
64 YO F x-ferred from the [**Hospital Ward Name **] for initiation of
chemotherapy for Small Cell Lung Ca.  Pt initially presented to
the OSH with right-sided CP, right shoulder pain, cough w/ occ.
hemoptysis, wt loss and found on CXR at OSH revealed RML and RLL
opacification and R tracheal deviation. CT chest reportedly
revealed large mass in right chest encasing RMSB and causing
collapse of the RML and RLL, abutting R PA and descending PA and
posterolateral aspect of IVC. It also reportedly showed possible
left adrenal gland involvement. Bronchoscopy was not attempted
b/c she developed AF w/ RVR.  At OSH, Pt had MRI of brain
reportedly showing possible limbic encephalitis with abnormal
signals in b/l temporal lobes.
.
Pt transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**8-20**] for further mgmt. Underwent flex
bronch which showed L vocal cord edema, extrinsic RMS bronchus
obstuction occluding 100% of lumen on [**8-21**]. On [**8-22**], underwent
rigid bronch w/ TBNA, balloon dilatation, 2 stents placed in
RMSB c/b ptx which has persisted despite multiple chest tubes
placed.
Currently, pt denies sob at rest but reports DOE w/ [**1-2**] flight
of stairs. Also c/o dry cough and reports several episodes of
small amounts of hemoptysis, but some occured in setting of
epistaxis. She denies f/c/s, n/v/d/c, rash, HA, diplopia, focal
neurologic deficits.

RADIOLOGY  Final Report
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2136-8-22**] 5:31 PM
Small right pneumothorax following stent placement in right main
bronchus. Right upper lobe mass with partial collapse right
upper lobe and separate nodular density in right midzone.
.
PATHOLOGY
[**8-23**] path: Positive for malignant cells consistent with
poorly-differentiated carcinoma with features of a small cell
carcinoma.
Immunostains performed on cytospin slides show that tumor cells
are positive for cytokeratin cocktail (AE1/AE3/CAM 5.2), but are
negative for LCA, synaptophysin, and chromogranin. The findings
are compatible with a diagnosis of small cell carcinoma.
.
Bone scan [**8-27**]: IMPRESSION:  No evidence of bony metastatic
disease.  Increased tracer uptake lateral to the left kidney is
of uncertain significance.
.
CT torso [**8-27**]:
1.  Post pneumonectomy changes with associated right
hydropneumothorax and left to right mediastinal shift.

2.  Large abdominal nodal masses concerning for metastatic
disease.

3.  Small left adrenal lesion does not meet CT criteria for
benign lesion.
.
MRI of head [**8-26**]:
.
1. Increased T2 and FLAIR signal within the left medial temporal
lobe in the region of the hippocampus, and possibly within the
right uncus. In this patient with small cell lung cancer, a
paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis should be considered.
Alternatively, herpes encephalitis is also a consideration and a
neurology consult is recommended.

2.  Four-mm enhancing lesion in the periphery of the left
cerebellar
hemisphere without associated edema, possibly representing a
metastasis.

.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 yo female w/ newly dx'd SCLC s/p stenting of RMSB to preserve
airway patency, c/b pneumothorax. Admitted to oncology for
chemotherapy.
.
1. Metastatic SCLC - Large R sided lung mass encassing RMSB.
Possible adrenal gland [**Last Name (LF) 1364**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] lesions possibly resembling
[**First Name3 (LF) 1364**], multiple adbominal nodular lesions. Bone scan negative for
[**First Name3 (LF) 1364**]. Clinically stable since stent placement x2. After transfer
to oncology, one chemotherapy cycle with VP-16 was completed and
well tolerated. Percocet prn and Dilaudid prn for pain control
of intermittent epigastric pain. Dolasetron was given for nausea
as needed. Patient was pain free and in good condition upon
discharge.
.
2. Confusion: On admission, patient was mildly confused, but
alert and fully oriented upon admission to oncology. Patient was
suspected to have paraneoplastic encephalitis vs HSV
encephalitis according to an MRI of the brain that also showed
brain lesions likely to be [**First Name3 (LF) 1364**]. Pt has a baseline short-term
memory loss since [**1-2**] yr according to daughter (pt occasionally
forgets events after 1/2h). Pt was started on ACV b/o possible
HSV encephalitis according to neurology consult, but D/C'ed
again since LP from [**8-29**] contained only 1 RBC and CSF HSV PCR
result was negative. However, anti-[**Doctor Last Name **] Ab and anti-Ma2 Ab were
also negative. The confusion improved considerably towards the
end of her hospital stay. The patient was fully oriented on
discharge although her baseline forgetfulness remained
unchanged.
.
3. F/E/N: IV fluid hydration as needed. Electrolytes were
repleted PRN.
.
4. PPX: H2 Blocker. SQ Heparin.

5. Code Status: Full.

.
