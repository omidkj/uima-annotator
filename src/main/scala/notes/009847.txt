creatinine was 1.6, and blood glucose was 672.  Urinalysis
demonstrated specific gravity of 1.02, greater than 1000

HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  DIABETES ISSUES:  Mr. [**Known lastname 111154**] was admitted to the
Intensive Care Unit initially for glucose and electrolyte
management given his diabetic ketoacidosis.  He was
maintained on an insulin drip and given fluid hydration with
between 500 and one liter of fluid per hour initially.

The patient had rapidly correcting glucose values which
normalized by late evening on the day of admission.  At that
time, the patient was transitioned to NPH sliding-scale
insulin with good glucose control.  The patient was restarted
on his home regimen of NPH 25 units subcutaneously q.a.m. and
15 units subcutaneously q.h.s.  He was arranged to follow up
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10145**] at the [**Hospital **] Clinic for more intensive
teaching with regard to his disease.  At the time of
discharge, the patient was without an anion gap.

2.  RENAL SYSTEM:  The patient initially presented with an
elevated creatinine of 1.4; however, quickly normalized to
baseline of 0.7 with hydration.  He was maintained on his ACE
inhibitor.

3.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient was treated for his upper
respiratory infection with Robitussin as needed for cough.
His asthma remained stable.  He was without wheezes
throughout this admission.  He was continued on his Flovent
and albumin inhalers as needed.  He was provided with a
spacer, peak flow meter, and brief teaching with regard to
his asthma.  He will need further followup with his primary
care physician.

4.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient presented with
flu-like symptoms and upper respiratory involvement
consistent with a viral illness.  He did not have temperature
spikes.  His white count rapidly normalized after acute
stress from diabetic ketoacidosis to 6.1 at the time of
discharge.  The patient was provided with supportive
treatment including fluids and Tylenol.  He should plan to
follow up with his primary care physician if his symptoms do
not improve.

5.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient was continued on
lisinopril and Lipitor with good blood pressure control.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Diabetic ketoacidosis.
2.  Viral illness.
3.  Type 1 diabetes.
4.  Asthma.
5.  Hypercholesterolemia.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to follow
up with his primary care physician (Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) in the
week after discharge.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. once per day.
2.  Lisinopril 5 mg p.o. once per day.
3.  Flovent 220.
4.  Albuterol as needed.
