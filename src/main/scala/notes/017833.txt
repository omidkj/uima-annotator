Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**4-3**]- cardiac catherization, Angiosculpt balloon & promus [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] to prox ramus

History of Present Illness:
58-yo M w/ CAD, ischemic cardiomyopathy (TTE '[**85**] LVEF 30%),
Stage III/IV CKD (baseline Cr 2.5-3.0), DM2 with neuropathy,
HTN, HL, COPD, OSA on BiPap, and morbid obesity (366 lbs) who
presented to OSH w/ [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath.

His cardiac history began in [**2185**] when he experienced an
inferior MI and underwent RCA stenting. He developed in-stent
restenosis in [**2187**] and had Taxus stent placed. In [**1-/2194**] he
started developing chest discomfort w/ minimal exertion and even
at rest, somewhat improved w/ SL NTG. He presented to the ED in
[**1-/2194**] where he r/o for MI. Follow-up stress test showed
moderate inferolateral and anterolateral ischemia; TTE showed
LVEF 40%.

He underwent cardiac cath in [**1-/2194**] at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital
which revealed 50% LAD, 70% ramus, 80% lower pole of ramus, and
total occlusion of RCA and Cx. He was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
for consult regarding potential CABG, but deemed inappropriate
for surgery d/t poor targets. He was scheduled to have planned
ramus PCI on [**2194-4-3**], but patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**]
Hospital on [**2194-3-25**] with chest pain, shortness of breath, and
found to be in CHF and with elevated troponin, ruled in for
NSTEMI w/ peak of 0.41. He was diuresed and creatinine rose to
4.4. With IVFs, his creatinine improved to 3.9.

In the cath lab pt was on BiPAP, had lower pole of distal ramus
dilated w/ 2.5x10mm Angiosculpt balloon and prox ramus lesion
direct stented w/ Promus DES. Pt transferred to CCU from cath
lab for respiratory distress requiring BiPAP. In CCU, pt is

Pertinent Results:
[**2194-4-3**] CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION:

1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system showed 2
vessel
coronary artery disease.  The LMCA and LAD had no angiographic
flow-limiting disease.  The LCX was occluded.  The ramus
intermedius had
an ulcerated proximal 80% stneosis and an origin 80% stenosis of
a lower
pole.  The RCA was known occluded and not selective injected.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed a central aortic
pressure of
144/73 mmHg.
3. Successful PTCA and placement of a 3.0x23mm Promus drug
eluting stent
in the ramus intermedius were performed.  Final angiography
showed
normal flow, no apparent dissection, and no residual stenosis.
(See
PTCA comments.)

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. PTCA and placement of a drug eluting stent in the ramus
intermedius.

[**4-4**] TTE:
Due to very suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF ? 55%). The aortic valve is
not well seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 41628**] is a 58 year-old gentleman with CAD s/p PCI to RCA
'[**85**] c/b in-stent restenosis w/ Taxus '[**87**], DM2, HTN, HL, COPD,
OSA on Bi-PAP, and morbid obesity s/p catheterization w/ DES to
ramus, transferred to CCU for management of respiratory
distress.

1. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: Mr. [**Known lastname 41628**] was admitted to the CCU
after cardiac cath (details below) due to persistent need for
BiPAP to maintain adequate oxygenation.  Necessity for BiPAP
likely multifactorial including underlying COPD, OSA requiring
CPAP at home, volume overload and possible pneumonia.  He was
continued on BiPAP, completed antibiotic course for aommunity
acquired pneumonia, and attempted to diurese.  Initially, his
fluid balance was positive and he did not respond to lasix gtt
or bolus due to presumed post-contrast ATN.  After discontinuing
lasix gtt, urine output imrpoved temporarily, however, after
renal consult lasix gtt was restarted with improved diuresis.
He was transitioned to his home CPAP at night with intermittant
use during the day (alternating with high flow oxygen).  His
breathing improved with diuresis.  When off of BiPAP, his
outpatient COPD medications were restarted.  His breathing
continued to improve over his hospital course with no oxygen
requirement during the day and continued CPAP usage at night.
He was evaluated by PT who cleared him for discharge. His O2
requirement continued to improve and by the time of discharge he
was satting 95% on room air, even while ambulating with Physical
therapy.

2. NSTEMI/CAD: Mr. [**Known lastname 41628**] was transferred from an outside
hospital for cardiac catheterization in setting of chest pain
and ruling in for NSTEMI by cardiac enzymes.  On cardiac
catheterization he had DES placed to ramus and was chest pain
free post-procedure and for rest of admission.  Continue on high
dose aspirin.  Plavix 75 mg daily started, will need to be
continued for 1 year.  Continued metoprolol and Imdur as
prescribed as an outpatient.  His simvastatin was changed to
Lipitor 80 mg with no adverse effect, however based on lipid
studies, statin was changed back to simvastatin that he took as
outpatient.  Ranexa was continued for angina.  Echo was very
suboptimal post-procedure with limited information interpreted
from it, possible LVEF of 55%.  Mr. [**Known lastname 41628**] was previously on [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) **]/HCTZ combination, however given his acute renal failure this
was held during the course of his admission and no ACE-I or
other [**Last Name (un) **] was started.  He remained chest pain free for the rest
of the admission.

3. ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Mr. [**Known lastname 41629**] renal function
was impaired on admission with concern for possible new baseline
at OSH of approx [**2-6**].  His creatinine on admission was 3.7 and
worsened daily post-catheterization, felt to be consistent with
post-contrast ATN.  Initial volume status was positive due to
poor urine output.  Urine output improved with lasix gtt and Mr.
[**Known lastname 41628**] diuresed steadily.  Nephrology was consulted and
recommended monitoring patient to avoid dialysis.  Creatinine
peaked at 8.3 and trended down there after with good urine
output.  He was started a phospherus binder during the admission
but at time of discharge, it was no longer need
