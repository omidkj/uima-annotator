History of Present Illness:
65 yo M with h/o AML D+119 s/p allo-SCT presents with febrile
neutropenia and fatigue. He was seen in clinic on [**2125-6-1**] and was
feeling well, his performace status was 100%. His peripheral
blood showed 19% atypicals which later were read by pathology as
blasts. There was concern for relapse. He was brought back to
clinic on [**2125-6-5**] for a lab check and had 54% blasts. He reports
that 5 days prior to admission he had a temp of 100.6 which
quickly resolved. Then two days prior to admission he began to
feel weak and have chills. This morning his daughter took his
temperature and it was 101.2. He still complains of fatigue and
weakness. He felt some lightheadedness, but no fainting or LOC.
He denies CP, SOB, cough, diarrhea, dysuria, hematuria, no
rectal pain.

He was given cefepime and vancomycin.

Pertinent Results:
Studies:
[**2125-6-7**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change compared to
radiograph from [**2125-4-6**]. No acute cardiopulmonary process.

[**2125-6-10**] CT chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Small peripheral basilar consolidation of the left lower lobe
which is nonspecific and may represent atelectasis versus early
pneumonia.

2. Three-mm nodule in the right lower lobe and a 4-mm nodule in
the right upper lobe for which attention should be paid on
followup examinations.

3. Sub-cm exophytic hyperdense lesion within the upper pole of
the right kidney which is nonspecific and may represent a
hemorrhagic cyst, however MRI is indicated on a non-emergent
basis for further characterization.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Leukemia Relapse.
Mr. [**Known lastname 22571**] was found on admission to have 90% circulating
blasts, consistent with a relapse of his leukemia. He was
treated with a cycle of decitabine and ultimately started on
hydrea for cytoreduction. Discussion regarding donor lymphocyte
infusion was started and the patient will follow up with his
[**State 792**]Oncologist and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] for further therapy.
.
2. Febrile Neutropenia
On admission, Mr. [**Known lastname 22571**] had fever and neutropenia. There was
no obvious source for infection given lack of localizing signs
or symptoms initially. He did have a portacath which looked
clean and intact. He was initially started on cefepime and
vancomycin but continued to spike to 102 with occasional rigors.
His initially set of blood cultures had [**3-28**] bottle of coag
negative staph that subsequently cleared after a 14 day course
of antibiotics. For possibility of fungal infection, he was
treated with caspofungin, and this was later broadened to
voriconazole. The patient had recurrent bouts of
fever/hypothermia and hypotension requiring MICU treatment, but
was able to be stabilized with fluids and never required
pressors.  On [**2125-6-29**], the patient cultured out Gram Negative
Rods, that speciated to stenotrophomonas maltophilia. His
antibiotic regimen was changed to high dose bactrim IV for a
planned 2 week course followed by chronic treatment with PO
bactrim.
.
3. rash- He developed maculopapular rash on legs on [**2125-6-13**]-
nickel size erythematous raised lesions, which were initially
non pruritic but became pruritic. There was concern over sweet's
syndrome vs. leukemia cutis. A dermatology consult was obtained
and biopsies were taken. The biopsy showed superficial to
mid-dermal perivascular mixed lymphocytic and eosinophilic
infiltrate with atypical mononuclear cells consistent with
blasts and red blood cell extravasation. No vasculitis or
neutrophilic infiltrate is seen. A hypersensitivity reaction
with infiltration by circulating leukemic cells is favored,
however if the eruption becomes more prominent, re-biopsy to
exclude the development of leukemia cutis should be considered,
as clinically appropriate.  Over the course of the
hospitalization, the rash become less prominent and improved.
.
4. Disposition: After a prolonged hospitalization, the patient
was discharged home to complete the IV bactrim course. He will
follow up with his hematologist in [**Doctor Last Name 792**]for further
decitabine and will follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] for further
discussion regarding donor lymphocyte infusion.
