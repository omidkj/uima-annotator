Final Report
CTA OF THE CHEST DATED [**2190-8-19**]

INDICATION: Poor oxygenation. Clinical suspicion for pulmonary
embolism.
COMPARISON: Chest CT [**2190-8-2**].
TECHNIQUE: Volumetric, multidetector CT acquisition of the chest
was
performed following intravenous administration of 98 cc of
Optiray. Prior to this contrast-enhanced sequence, a low-dose
unenhanced scan of the chest was performed. Multiplanar
reformation images were submitted for review in conjunction with
axial images.

FINDINGS: Pulmonary vasculature is well opacified with contrast,
and
demonstrates no evidence of an acute pulmonary embolism. The
main pulmonary artery is enlarged measuring 3.4 cm in diameter.
Coronary artery
calcifications are present in the right, left main, left
anterior descending and circumflex arteries, and valvular
calcifications are also demonstrated within the aortic valve.
Heart size is normal.

Enlarging lymph nodes are present within the mediastinum,
including a 1.4 cm lower right paratracheal node, previously
measuring about 8 mm. Additionally, apparently new hilar lymph
nodes have developed. Very small bilateral pleural effusions are
also new.

Within the lungs, there are new dependent areas of confluent
opacification
with air bronchograms, involving the left lower lobe to a
greater degree than the right, and associated with mild degree
of volume loss. Widespread
emphysema is without change.

Within the airways, new secretions have developed within the
trachea and
proximal right main bronchus. A new linear and nodular opacity
has developed at the left lung apex with maximal nodular
component dimension of about 8 mm image 8, series 3).
Additionally, new smoothly marginated septal thickening has
developed diffusely.

Previously reported tiny pulmonary nodules are largely obscured
by the acute lung abnormalities that have developed in the
interval.

No suspicious skeletal lesions are identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

2. Enlarged main pulmonary artery suggestive of pulmonary
arterial
hypertension.

3. New bibasilar confluent lung opacities, in conjunction with
airway
secretions, raising the possibility of aspiration pneumonia,
although
atelectasis is an additional consideration.

4. Mild hydrostatic pulmonary edema and very small pleural
effusions.

5. New small nodular opacity at left lung apex, very likely
benign
considering rapid development over a two-week period. Previously
reported
small nodules are not well assessed due to obscuration by acute
lung findings. Please see previous recommendations under prior
report (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) 79600**]).

6. Coronary artery calcifications and aortic valvular
calcifications.

7. New enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, likely
reactive in the
setting of presumed acute aspiration pneumonia. These can be
reassessed at
the time of the previously recommended chest CT.

8. Trace ascites and mild anasarca.

Final Report
CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST

INDICATION FOR STUDY: Pylorus sparing Whipple, now with bilious
output from
NG tube. Evaluate for obstruction.

TECHNIQUE: Following ingestion of oral contrast, a helical scan
was obtained through the abdomen and pelvis without use of
intravenous contrast material and images reformatted in the
axial, sagittal, and coronal planes.

FINDINGS:

ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: Bilateral pleural effusions are
present with
bilateral lower lobe areas of consolidation. Heart is
unremarkable. A small amount of ascitic fluid surrounds the
liver. No focal mass lesions are seen in the liver. The patient
is recently post-surgery and a small amount of air is seen
within the bile ducts in the left lobe of the liver. Surgical
drains are in position around the pancreatic bed. Oral contrast
is located entirely within the stomach and in the proximal small
bowel and stomach is not distended. No extravasation of contrast
is noted. No abnormal dilatation of small bowel is identified.
No abnormal dilatation of the afferent or efferent loops is
identified. The spleen is normal in size. The patient is status
post Whipple resection with atrophy of the body and tail of the
pancreas. A large benign-appearing cyst is present in the
lateral aspect of the left kidney. The right kidney is atrophic.
The adrenal glands are unremarkable.

PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: Visualized large and small bowels in the
pelvis are
unremarkable and not dilated. Extensive vascular calcifications
are noted.  No free fluid is seen in the pelvis. No enlarged
deep pelvic nodes or inguinal nodes are identified. Extensive
sigmoid diverticulosis is noted with no definitive evidence for
diverticulitis.

BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are seen
within the
skeleton.
