Radiology
[**2-25**] CXR: Two supine portable radiographs are examined, and
second displaying interval placement of the endotracheal tube
with its tip approximately 2.7 cm from the carina. The lungs are
otherwise clear without evidence of parenchymal consolidation.
There is mild prominence of the interstitial vessels which may
be related to supine position or a mild amount of fluid
overload. No evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusions. The
patient is noted to be status post median sternotomy/AVR, and
has a cervical plate and fixation screws identified in the
midcervical spine. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal
limits.

[**2-26**] CXR: Lungs are clear. Heart size normal. No pleural
abnormality. Sternal wires and spinal stabilization device
noted. Patient has been extubated

[**2-26**] Left elbow: Small left elbow joint effusion with a possible
supracondylar lucency. Follow up imaging is recommended.

[**2-27**] left upper extremity CT (prelim): Subtle lucency extending
through lateral epicondyle, mild irregularity on lateral aspect
radial head. Most likely represents subtle non-displace
fractures. Soft tissues unremarkable. Small joint effusion
noted. No disclocation.

Brief Hospital Course:
39 year old female presents with benzodiazepine/alcohol
intoxication in a probably suicide attempt. She presented to
[**Hospital1 18**] from an outside hospital, minimally responsive, unable to
protect her airway.  Hospital course by problem:

1) Respiratory failure: Patient initially had respiratory
acidosis despite bag mask ventilation, and minimal spontaneous
inspiratory effort. Respiratory depression likely [**2-7**]
intoxication from alcohol and other substances. S/p dose of
Narcan on arrival for unresponsiveness.  She was intubated on
night of arrival for airway protection in the setting of her
altered mental status.  She was extubated the following morning
and remained stable on room air thereafter. To continue advair
and albuterol inhalers.

2) Benzodiazepine/alcohol intoxication: Given suspected
intentional ingestion, the psychiatry service was consulted, who
suspected suicide attempt and recommended inpatient psychiatric
hospitalization. The patient was continued on a 1:1 sitter. She
was continued on thiamine, folate, and multivitamin throughout
her hospital course.

3) Anxiety/Depression: As mentioned above, the psychiatry
service followed the patient closely throughout her hospital
stay. Initially, her psychiatric medications (Lamictal,
Seroquel, Klonopin, Celexa, Ritalin) were held at their
recommendation. She was then restarted on her trazadone, a
reduced dose of Lamictal, and Klonopin 1 mg PO BID. At time of
discharge, she was medically stable for transfer to an inpatient
psychiatric facility.

4) Left elbow pain: Following transfer to the general medical
floor, she noted left elbow pain, with difficulty extending her
left elbow. Plain films showed a possible supracondylar lucency,
for which she underwent a left upper extremity CT scan, which
revealed subtle linear lucency at lateral epicondyle and
irregularity at the lateral radial head consistent with
non-displaced fractures. The orthopedic service was consulted
and recommended daily range of motion exercises (which she can
do herself) but she is not to do any resistance exercise. She
will be fitted with a hinged L elbow brace, and follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1005**] of orthopedics on [**3-11**].

5) Asthma: The patient was continued on advair and albuterol.

6) Vitamin B12 deficiency: Given a mildly depressed vitamin B12
level, the patient was started on oral repletion. A repeat
vitamin B12 level should be obtained as an outpatient to ensure
adequate repletion.

7) Hypothyroidism: The patient was continued on her home dose of
levothyroxine. TSH level was within normal limits.

8) Hypertension: The patient was restarted on Toprol XL prior to
discharge.

9) Full Code.

10) discharged to [**Hospital1 1680**] HRI, inpatient psychiatric facility,
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1691**].
