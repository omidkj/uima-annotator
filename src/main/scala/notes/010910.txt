Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a
fifty-nine-year-old man with hypertension on no medications
who presented to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital in [**Hospital1 1474**] on [**2156-8-4**]. Six hours prior to his presentation to the Emergency
Department, the patient had developed chest pain, severe
indigestion, shortness of breath, diaphoresis and tingling
down both arms. An electrocardiogram done in the Emergency
Department showed 5 mm to [**Street Address(2) 7565**] elevations in the
anterolateral leads. The patient was thrombolysed with 8 mL
TNK and treated with 81 mg aspirin, Lopressor 15 mg
intravenous, Heparin GTT. The patient's indigestion continued
throughout the night but it had resolved upon transfer to
[**Hospital1 69**] in the morning on [**2156-8-5**]. At the outside hospital, cardiac enzymes were
initially normal but peaked with a creatine phosphokinase of
30/64, creatine kinase myocardial bound 438 and Troponin 219.
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 69**], the
patient's electrocardiogram showed continue ST elevations in
the anterolateral lead and the patient was taken directly to
the catheterization laboratory. The patient's catheterization
showed normal left ventricular main coronary artery, 50%
proximal left anterior descending artery, 90% focal mid with
20% diffuse OM lesion, focal 50% mid right coronary artery
and an left ventricular function of 30% with a cardiac index
of 2.2. Ventriculogram showed moderate systolic ventricular
dysfunction with mild systolic biventricular dysfunction. The
left anterior descending artery was stented with 0% residual
on TIMI three flow. Due to the large area of infarct, as well
as persistent ST elevations in the anterolateral leads, the
patient was transferred to the CCU for monitoring.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Past surgical history is unknown.

SOCIAL HISTORY: Four to five alcoholic drinks per night.
Tobacco, two packs per day. The patient is married, lives
with his family out in [**Hospital1 1474**] and works as a bus mechanic.

FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: Negative for heart disease.

OUTPATIENT MEDICATIONS: None.

ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical examination on admission to
the CCU, temperature 101.2 F, blood pressure 130/68, heart
rate 84, respiratory rate 20, 97% on two liters nasal
cannula. In general, the patient is in no acute distress. The
patient is somnolent but answers questions appropriately.
Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination, oropharynx
clear. Mucous membranes moist. Poor dentition. JVP not well
seen due to the necessity of the patient lying flat,
secondary to femoral sheath. Chest, clear to auscultation
anteriorly. Cardiovascular, regular rate, normal S1, S2,
positive S3, no murmurs or rubs. Abdomen was soft, nontender,
nondistended, normal active bowel sounds. Extremities, right
groin site with femoral sheath and Swan-Ganz catheter without
oozing or hematoma, 1 to 2+ posterior tibialis and dorsalis
pedis pulses bilaterally. The skin was warm and dry.

LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory studies sent from outside
hospital, white blood cell count 16.1, hemoglobin 16,
hematocrit 47.8, platelet count 229,000.

Chemistry panel, sodium 137, potassium 4.4, chloride 100,
bicarbonate 28, blood, urea and nitrogen 10, creatinine 0.9,
glucose 136.

Partial prothrombin time 26.

Total cholesterol 182, high-density lipoprotein 51,
low-density lipoprotein 112, triglycerides 97.

AST 507, ALT 105, alkaline phosphatase 98, total bilirubin
0.2, albumin 3.2, LDH 262.

IMPRESSION: Fifty-eight-year-old male with no known coronary
disease, history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia presenting
with a large anterolateral ST elevation. Myocardial
infarction which was lysed at outside and an left anterior
descending artery stented with 0% residual, now with
anterolateral apical dyskinesis, akinesis and ejection
fraction of 35%.

HOSPITAL COURSE: Cardiovascular, A) coronary artery disease,
please see above History of Present Illness for cardiac
catheterization results. Following catheterization, the
patient was started on aspirin, Plavix and Integrilin which
was continued for eighteen hours. The patient was started on
Heparin following Integrilin being discontinued and femoral
sheath being pulled. As transaminitis resolved on repeat
laboratory studies at [**Hospital1 69**]
with an AST of 113, ALT of 66, the patient was started on
Lipitor 10 mg every day. Cardiac enzymes peaked at outside
hospital with a creatine kinase of 3564, creatine kinase
myocardial bound 438.6 and an index of 6.8 with a Troponin of
219. Cardiac enzymes during hospital course at [**Hospital1 346**] showed creatine kinase peak at 1431,
creatine kinase myocardial bound 94 and index of 6.6 on [**2156-8-5**], at 6 p.m. Cardiac enzymes trended down throughout
the remainder of the hospital course. B) Systolic
dysfunction. The patient with an ejection fraction of 35% by
ventriculogram in the catheterization laboratory. Follow-up
GTE, the following day showed ejection fraction of 40%,
anterior distal septal and apical akinesis. Due to risk of
left ventricular thrombus formation due to akinesis, the
patient was loaded with Heparin and started on Coumadin prior
to discharge. C) Hypertension. The patient was on no
medications on admission and was started on Metoprolol 25
twice a day which was increased to 50 twice a day and
switched to Toprol XL 100 every day on discharge. An ACE
inhibitor was also started and the patient was discharged on
Enalapril 2.5 mg every day. Throughout the hospital course,
the patient's systolic blood pressure ranged from high 80's
to approximately 110 and therefore, the patient was not
titrated up any further on antihypertensives. D) Rhythm and
rate. The patient had a six beat run of nonsustained
ventricular tachycardia approximately twenty-four hours after
onset of symptoms. Electrophysiology was consulted and will
be following up with the patient with further studies as an
outpatient. The patient was on telemetry for his entire
hospital course and no other arrhythmias were noted.

2) Gastrointestinal. The patient had transient transaminitis
present in outside hospital which trended down throughout
hospital course here. Transaminitis was considered secondary
to myocardial ischemia and it was felt safe to start Lipitor.

3) Hematology. On admission, the patient with hematocrit of
40 which showed a drop to 34 on hospital day number two,
(which was later noted to be a laboratory error). However,
stools were guaiac and the patient was found to be guaiac
positive times one. The patient's hematocrit with the
exception of the laboratory error was constant at 40
throughout the hospital course and it was deemed appropriate
to follow-up with an outpatient colonoscopy. The patient
reported no bright red blood per rectum or melena throughout
the hospital course.

4) Infectious Disease. On admission to outside hospital, the
patient was febrile with increased white blood cell count.
Both trended down throughout the hospital course and were
felt to be attributed to myocardial infarct.

5) DISPOSITION: Physical Therapy saw and evaluated the
patient and it was felt safe for the patient to be discharged
to home. The patient to follow-up as an outpatient with
Cardiology, cardiac rehabilitation.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE: Improved and stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1) Status post anterolateral myocardial
infarct with stent placement. 2) Hypertension. 3)
Hyperlipidemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 mg every day, Plavix 75 mg
every day times thirty days, Toprol XL 100 every day, Lipitor
10 every day, Enalapril 2.5 mg every day, Warfarin 5 mg every
day.

FOLLOW-UP: Follow-up appointments, 1) Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **],
[**Location (un) **], primary care physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient to
schedule appointment for the week of [**2156-8-9**]. 2) Prior
