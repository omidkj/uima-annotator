Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: 51 y/o F PMH COPD, Crohn's disease, AS s/p
replacement who presents with chronic cough and hypoxia.

# Pneumonia/COPD exacerbation: Patient with clinical history,
symptoms & CXR supporting a pneumonia. CXR demonstrated a RML
and LLL infiltrate. The patient was initially admitted to the
ICU due to her oxygen requirement, but she improved with
Prednisone, Azithromycin, and Ceftriaxone. She was maintained on
standing Albuterol/Ipratropium nebulizers and O2 by NC (she
requires 3L at home at baseline). She was transferred to the
medicine floor within one hospital day and was discharged on a
Prednisone taper, a 7 day course of Cefpodoxime & a 5 day course
of Azithromycin.

# Hypotension: Patient admitted with hypotension [**2-16**] diarrhea &
insensible losses from infection, that resolved with IVF's. She
demonstrated no positive SIRS criteria suggesting underlying
sepsis. Two sets of cardiac enzymes were negative. When her
hypotension resolved, her home antihypertensives were restarted
without incident.

# Microcytic anemia: Patient with a baseline Hct of 32 (baseline
ranges from 25-32), likely secondary to iron deficiency from
Crohn's disease. Patient's stools were guaiac negative during
this admission.

# Crohn's disease: Patient continued her home Budesonide and
Sulfasalazine. A bowel regimen was held at the patient's request
given tendency toward diarrhea.

# HTN: Patient's home Lisinopril 5mg qPM & Atenolol 25mg PO
daily were held in the context of hypotension & restarted when
her hypotension resolved.

# Chronic pain: Patient continue her outpatient medications
Dilaudid and Lyrica.
