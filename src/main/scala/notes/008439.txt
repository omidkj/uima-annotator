Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on same day for procedure, subtotal
gastrectomy was performed under general endotracheal anesthesia
through a vertical midline abdominal incision.  Intraoperative
findings included a large tumor of the mid-stomach, mobile and
not well-attached to the wall.  2 enlarged lymph nodes were
noted around the mid stomach and lesser curvature, but there was
no evidence of metastatic disease to the liver or the peritoneal
surfaces.  Intravenous antibiotics were given, and the procedure
was well tolerated.

In the PACU after the procedure the patient became tachycardic
to the 130's with max temperature of 102.6.  He was
pan-cultured, given Tylenol x 2 doses, and became hypotensives,
requiring 1 unit packed red blood cells, and a Neo drip for
systolic blood pressure in the 80's.  He was transferred to the
TICU for further monitoring.
A cardiology consult was obtained to further assist management.


Cardiac enzymes were noted to be elevated post-procedure, at
which point a heparin drip was started.  An echo was performed,
showing persistently decreased LVEF of 20-25%, with possibly
worsened inferior hypokinesis.  The heparin drip was
discontinued after 48 hours, at which point the troponin had
plateaued at 1.99 and the CK-MB was declining.  After the
patient had stabilized clinically, he was transferred to the
floor.  He did not complain of chest pain or shortness of breath
during this episode.

The patient gradually improved clinically, NG tube and Foley
were discontinued on post-operative day 6.  His diet was
advanced, pain was increasingly well-controlled.  He voided well
after the Foley was DC-ed, and ambulated independently.

The patient was discharged to home on post-operative day 8, at
which point the skin staples were removed, replaced with
steri-strips.  The wound appeared clean, dry, and intact.  He
was instructed to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within the next
week, and he had an appointment scheduled with his cardiologist
in a week and a half.  (Monday, [**10-18**]).
