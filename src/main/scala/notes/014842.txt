Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory distress, cardiac arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with drug-eluting stent


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 79692**] is a 73yo woman with h/o DM2, CHF, and HTN who
presented to [**Hospital3 **]w/ respiratory distress with
subsequent asystolic cardiac arrest.
.
Per EMS records, she was having difficulty breathing this
morning at midnight, about 1 hour after she had gone to bed. She
woke up her daughter stating she couldn't breath. Per daughter,
she has had a dry cough and has had worsening DOE. When EMS
arrived, she was able to speak/answer questions but was in
respiratory distress. Her vitals were BP 142/100 HR 140 RR 24
02sat <60 on RA.
.
On transport, the patient became unresponsive in the ambulance 2
min prior to arrival to the OSH. At the OSH her VS were T 98.1
BP 144/48 HR 30 RR 2 02sat 50% on NRB. The decision was made for
emergent intubation. At this time, she went into asystolic
arrest. CPR was initiated and atropine/epi were administered
with return of pulse (her total arrest time was 1-2 min
according to her daughter). She was intubated and set to Fi02
100% AC 600/15 with (ABG 7.26/36/88). A femoral line was placed.
A CXR was read as bilateral fluffy infiltrates c/w volume
overload vs ARDS. She was given vanc/zosyn. She became
hypotensive to SBP of 70's and was started on a dopamine gtt.
Soon after she went into a wide complex tachycardia; dopamine
was stopped and she was started on an amio gtt (w/ 150mg bolus)
with conversion back to sinus bradycardia. Pressor was changed
to levophed. She was given ASA 300mg and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were: T 96.5 BP 93/23 HR 93 RR 17 02
sat 100% on vent. The levophed gtt was uptitrated [**3-16**] to
hypotension. She was given atropine 0.5mg for HR "in the 50's"
and amiodarone was stopped because of bradycardia. A RIJ was
placed under sterile conditions. She was given levaquin x1.
Cardiology was consulted and a bedside echo was done. Her CVP
was 16 and SV02 was 80. Labs were significant for a WBC 31.3,
lactate 2.5, proBNP 1065, trop T 0.06, and negative UA.
.
She was initially admitted to the MICU, where she was continued
on levophed. She had an episode of hyperkalemia that was treated
with calcium and dextrose. She received 20mg of IV lasix with
300cc Uop over the next few hours. Insulin gtt was started for
improved glucose control.
.
Further review of systems not possible at this time.

[**2126-8-27**] CXR
1. Ill-defined bilateral perihilar consolidations, differential
includes ARDS and multifocal pneumonia. Acute cardiogenic
pulmonary edema is possible, although the cardiac silhouette is
not particularly enlarged, and clinical history is not entirely
consistent with pulmonary edema.
2. 8-mm right lower lobe nodule is relatively [**Name2 (NI) 15410**], most
probably
representing a granuloma. When the patient is clinically able,
CT could be
performed to confirm this suspicion.

[**2126-8-27**] 2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild to moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with septal and apical hypokinesis.  LVEF
40%.  Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

[**2126-8-28**] CARDIAC CATH
1. Selective coronary angiography of this left dominant system
revealed
single vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was without
angiographically apparent stenosis. The LAD revealed a mid 80%
lesion after the second marginal. The Lcx and RCA and no
angiographically apparent stenoses.
2. Resting Hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling pressures with a RVEDP of 15 mmHg and a PCWP of 19. PASP
was mildly elevated at 40 mmHg. Systemic arterial pressures were
normal on levophed. Cardiac index was preserved at 3.2L/min/m2.
3. Left Ventriculography was deferred.
4. Successful PTCA/stent to mid LAD with a 2.5x13mm Cypher
stent. The second diagonal branch was compromised as a result
and there was rescued and dilated with a 2.0mm balloon finishing
with kissing balloon inflations in LAD and diagonal. Excellent
result with normal flow and no residual stenosis.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Single vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Mild
