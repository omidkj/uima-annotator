Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
status post pulmonary vein isolation for a-fib now with cardiac
tamponade

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pulmonary vein isolation


History of Present Illness:
67 year old female with a history of atrial fibrillation,
asthma/COPD, HLD, osteoporosis, glaucoma presented with cardiac
tamponade s/p pulmonary vein isolation procedure. The pt has had
drug refractory a-fib which has been progressive over the past
few years despite failed attempts at cardioversion and rate
control (intolerance to beta blockers due to asthma/COPD). She
complains of fatigue and dyspnea with exertion and intermittent
palpitations that resolve with rest.
.
A pulmonary vein isolation procedure was performed on [**2181-9-28**]
which was complicated by perforation. BP dropped and an emergent
pericardiocentesis was performed and drain was put in place.
250cc of fluid was drained. Pt was given Protamine and started
on Phenylephrine. Transferred to CCU intubated. Hct dropped from
45 --> 34.7 after the procedure. Preop INR was 2.6.

No recent fever, cough, sputum, back pain, arthralgias, myalgias
or rash. The rest of the review of systems is negative in
detail.

FEMORAL ULTRASOUND [**2181-9-29**]:
IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for a pseudoaneurysm in the left
groin, that is predominantly thrombosed.
.
CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS [**2181-9-29**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. No retroperitoneal hematoma.
2. No pericardial effusion with catheter in the pericardial
space wrapping
around the heart.
3. A few ground-glass opacities throughout the lungs
bilaterally, as
described above. While these may represent focal areas of
atelectasis, a
six-month followup CT thorax is recommended to ensure stability
or resolution.
4. Unremarkable CT of the abdomen and pelvis.
.
ECHO [**2181-10-1**]: There is a bidirectional shunt across the
interatrial septum at rest. A secundum type atrial septal defect
is present. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). with mild global RV free wall hypokinesis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified
in person of the results on [**2181-10-1**] at 1430hours. Post removal
of the drain there was no accumulation of fluid in the
pericardial space.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 year old female with a history of atrial fibrillation,
COPD/asthma, osteoporosis, glaucoma, hyperlipidemia presented
with cardiac tamponade s/p pulmonary vein isolation procedure.
.
# CARDIAC TAMPONADE: Developed during EP procedure.
Paracardiocentesis was performed and drain was put in place.
250cc fluid was drained. Hypotension developed and the patient
was supported with phenylephrine. Hematocrit dropped 45-->34.7.
Followup Hct??????s were stable. The patient was then extubated and
sedation and phenylephrine were weaned. An attempt was made on
[**9-30**] to pull peridcardiocentesis drain which was unsuccessful as
the drain appeared to be adhesed to pericardium. The drain was
then removed [**10-1**] under fluoroscopy in the cath lab, as there
was concern that drain had adhered to pericardium. TTE after
drain removal showed no reaccumulation of fluid in the
pericardial space. The patient's hematocrit continued to be
stable and there was no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.
.
# RHYTHM: The patient has a history of a-fib refractory to
cardioversion and rate control. There is evidence of left atrial
tachycardia intermittently. After the pulmonary vein isolation
procedure she continued to be tachycardic with variable rate.
Amiodarone was loaded and converted to PO. Electrical
cardioversion was unsuccessful. She was discharged on Metoprolol
150mg po bid, Amiodarone 600 po qday until [**10-9**] and then 400mg
po daily thereafter, Warfarin 2.5mg po qday. She was scheduled
to follow up as an outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 52498**] in 2 weeks.
.
# UTI: positive U/A on [**2095-10-1**] with a low grade temperature but
the patient was asymptomatic. E. Coli was found on urine
culture. Her Foley catheter was removed. Bactrim was started and
will be continued for a 7 day course.
.
# Left CFA pseudoaneurusm: Found on femoral ultrasound. [**Date Range **]
surgery evaluated the patient and an appointment was set up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3407**] in 2 weeks where a repeat ultrasound will evaluate
progression. If the pseudoaneurysm increases to >2 cm, the
patient may need a thrombin injection.
.
# HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Home Simvastatin 20 po qday was continued.
.
# COPD/Asthma: Home spiriva and albuterol inh were continued.
.
# Osteoporosis: Home Vitamin D was continued.
.
# Glaucoma: Home eye drops were continued.
.
# Conditioning: PT was consulted. The patient progressed to
ambulating upon discharge.

FEN: Senna, colace and miralax prn were given during admission.
