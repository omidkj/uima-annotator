HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 60-year-old
male with a significant history of coronary artery disease
who presented to the [**Hospital1 69**]
with a positive stress test on [**10-3**] for cardiac
catheterization.  His cardiac catheterization revealed
3-vessel disease and a right-dominant system.  Left main
coronary appeared angiographically normal.  The left anterior
descending artery had 90% stenosis, the left circumflex had a
90% proximal stenosis, the right coronary artery was
completely occluded proximally with distal collateral filling
from the conus branch and left-to-right collaterals.
Hemodynamics showed elevated left ventricular end-diastolic
pressure and systolic arterial hypertension.

He was subsequently referred for a coronary artery bypass
graft which was performed on [**2166-10-6**] with left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery,
saphenous vein graft to first obtuse marginal, saphenous vein
graft to first diagonal.  His left circumflex was not grafted
because of poor touchdown sites; therefore, he was taken to
the catheterization laboratory where they performed a
successful percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty/stenting of the proximal and middle circumflex.
His postoperative course was complicated by atrial
fibrillation which was originally treated with amiodarone but
switched to procainamide due to transaminitis.  Thereafter he
converted to normal sinus rhythm.  He was treated with
aspirin and Plavix and discharged on [**10-16**].

After discharge, the patient was home for a few hours and
developed shortness of breath and bradycardia and was brought
back to the Emergency Room.  Upon arrival to the Emergency
Room he was intubated secondary to poor oxygenation from
congestive heart failure.  He was admitted to the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Service, and his cardiac enzymes were
cycled.  A.m. enzymes revealed a creatine kinase of 310.  He
was then taken to the catheterization laboratory where he was
found to have a thrombosed left circumflex stent distal to
the obtuse marginal graft.  The lesion received Angio-Jet and
an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed, and the patient was
transferred to the Coronary Care Unit.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Status post hip fracture.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Procainamide 750 mg and 500 mg
alternating doses p.o. q.i.d., Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.,
Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. times five days, Lipitor 20 mg p.o.
q.d., Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d., Percocet p.r.n., [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 233**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1002**] 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d. times five days.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission
temperature was 99.3, pulse of 109, blood pressure 102/42,
oxygen saturation 100% on CPAP with pressure support of 10,
PEEP of 5, FIO2 50%, tidal volume 450 cc with a respiratory
rate of 19 on propofol and dopamine and Integrilin drips.  In
general, the patient was intubated and sedated.  Head, ears,
nose, eyes and throat revealed pupils were equal and reactive
to light.  No jugular venous distention.  Sclerae were
anicteric.  Bilateral carotid bruits.  Heart had sinus
tachycardia, a [**2-11**] holosystolic murmur radiating to the
axilla.  Lungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly.  The
abdomen was soft, hyperactive bowel sounds.  Extremities
revealed pulses by Doppler, surgical incision on the lower
extremities healing well.  Lines:  A right arterial and
venous sheaths, left arch sheath.

LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  White blood cell
count 15.4, hematocrit 25.8, platelets 358.  Sodium 137,
potassium 4, chloride 101, bicarbonate 11, creatinine 0.9,
BUN 11.  INR 1.4, PTT 32.6, PT 14.3.  Magnesium 1.5.
Creatine phosphokinase 310, MB 20.  Urinalysis had positive
nitrites, moderate bacteria.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram from [**2166-10-16**]
revealed sinus bradycardia with normal axis and intervals,
new T wave inversions in I, aVL, II, III, and aVF, V2 through
V6 with ST depressions in V4.

[**2166-10-16**], post intervention revealed normal sinus
rhythm at 102 with no changes from prior electrocardiograms.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   While on the Coronary Care Unit the
patient was successfully extubated and intra-aortic balloon
pump was removed.  The patient's course in the Coronary Care
Unit was complicated by two episodes of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation which was converted with intravenous
procainamide and DC cardioversion.  He was eventually
switched to oral procainamide and remained in normal sinus
rhythm throughout the rest of his stay in the Coronary Care
Unit.  He will need to be reassessed for potential
anticoagulation if he were to convert to atrial fibrillation.

Additionally, he had episodes of chest pain which were not
associated with any electrocardiogram changes and relieved by
sublingual nitroglycerin.  He was noted to have a pericardial
friction rub and was treated with indomethacin.  Once his
vitals stabilized he was resumed on Lopressor and captopril.
At the time of discharge he remained free of chest pain.

His urinary tract infection was treated with 7-day course of
ciprofloxacin; [**1-9**] blood culture bottles grew
coagulase-negative Staphylococcus.  He was treated with
vancomycin for four days, but that was discontinued in light
of no fever spikes and other culture bottles showing no
growth.  Surveillance cultures were drawn 48 hours after
discontinuing vancomycin.  They had not grown anything at the
time of discharge.  It was likely that the one positive blood
culture was due to a skin contaminant.  Per Interventional
Cardiology recommendation, the patient was to be continued on
Plavix 150 mg p.o. for two month.

From and Endocrine standpoint the patient continued to have
elevated serum glucose levels.  He was put on an insulin
sliding-scale while in the hospital.  However, he will need
to be evaluated for diabetes on an outpatient basis since he
has clearly demonstrated fasting blood sugars greater than
126 on several occasions.

The patient was seen by Physical Therapy, and they evaluated
him as having good potential for returning to baseline
functional status.  He will need to be enrolled in a cardiac
rehabilitation program upon return to his home in Bermuda.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Procainamide 500 mg p.o. q.i.d.
3.  Plavix 150 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Captopril 37.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Myocardial infarction secondary to in-stent thrombosis of
left circumflex stent, status post Angio-Jet and restenting.
2.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home.
