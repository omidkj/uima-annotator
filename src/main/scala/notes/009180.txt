Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1572**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 77 yo M with h/o CHF c/o dyspnea and 23lb wt.
gain in last 10 days.  The patient was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] 10
days ago.  He has been followed closely by VNA and his
cardiolgoist.  His lasix doses have been progressively increased
but his weight has been going up and he has been having
worsening SOB.  Denies CP, SOB, fevers, chills.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 97.7 94 125/69 24 83%4L. O2 sat's
improved to the high 90's on NRB. BNP >3000. He received a total
of lasix 80mg IV x 1 and had 1900cc urine output.
.
In the MICU, the patient was started on Bumex IV 2mg prn dosing
for goal I/O of 1-2L negative daily with good effect. He was
restarted on spironolactone as well and has continued to diurese
with improvement in his symptoms. His verapamil was transiently
stopped on [**11-16**], and patient subsequently developed atrial
tachycardia, thought to be MAT,(which it was not)and was started
on a dilt drip and digoxin loaded. Dilt was transitioned to PO
verapamil, and he has been continued on the dig. HR appears to
be well controlled at this time. Additionally, he developed
increased erythema of his left lower extremity at the site of
his prior cellulitis, and blood cultures from that day grew coag
neg staph 2 out of 2. He was initially started on Vanc IV and
this was changed to tetracycline as a result of the patient's
allergies. He is currently on day 3 of 7.
.
The patient reports he is feeling much better, though not quite
to baseline. His SOB is much improved and he feels his ascites
is reduced. He denies fevers, chills, night sweats, headache,
chest pain, diarrhea, dysuria, melena or hematochezia. He does
report abdominal distention which is improved. Has 2 pillow
orthopnea at baseline and denies PND [**12-21**] using BiPAP at night.
Additionally, denies stroke, TIA, DVT, PE, joint pains,
hemoptysis or exertional buttock or calf pain. He does report a
chronic dry cough which is at his baseline.

Physical Exam:

HEENT - NCAT, PERRL, oropharynx clear, dry MM
Neck - supple, JVP elevated to angle of jaw (though has 4+ TR)
CV - distant heart sounds, RRR, faint [**11-24**] murmur at
Lungs - decreased breath sounds at bases, crackles 2/3 up
posteriorly on left, 1/2 up on right
Abdomen - distended, nontender, soft, + BS
Ext - b/l venous statsis changes/PVD, 1+ pitting edema
bilaterally, well-healed scar over left shin at site of prior
cellulitis, no open areas
.


Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
[**2109-11-13**] CXR - No significant change with persistent
cardiomegaly and likely bibasilar effusions/atelectasis. No
overt CHF.
[**2109-11-13**] KUB - Gas distended stomach. No evidence of
obstruction.
[**2109-11-13**] Ct Abdomen - Slight interval increase in small right
pleural effusion and intra-abdominal ascites. Otherwise, stable
CT appearance of the abdomen and pelvis.
[**2109-11-15**] Port abd - No dilated air-filled loops of bowel to
suggest obstruction
[**2109-11-16**] CXR - A single portable view of the chest is compared
to prior examination dated [**2109-11-13**]. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is enlarged, but stable. Current examination reveals
increasing patchy opacities at the bases bilaterally, right
slightly greater than left. Also, blunting of the right
costophrenic angle is noted, suggesting pleural effusion.
Probable underlying copd.
[**2109-11-17**] CXR - Cardiomegaly and residual CHF with small
effusions. Interval improvement compared with one day earlier.
.
EKG [**11-17**]: Rhythm is sinus tachycardia with atrial premature
complexes. There is borderline low voltage in both the limb
leads and precordial leads. There is an RSR' pattern in lead V1
as well as right axis deviation. There are diffuse ST-T wave
changes. Overall configuration suggests pulmonary disease. When
compared with prior tracing of [**2109-11-13**] the rate has increased,
though it is quite similar to tracing of [**2109-10-25**].
