Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1377**]
Chief Complaint:
Liver failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
: Patient is a 26 y/o female with PMHx GERD, depression, asthma,
who presents from an OSH with hepatotoxicity from acetaminophen
toxicity. The patient had a tonsillectomy 4 days ago and was
taking roxicet 10ml q6hrs and liquid tylenol 30ml q6hrs for the
past 4 days. She developed nausea on [**9-20**] and RUQ abdominal
pain on [**9-21**] and presented to [**Hospital 7188**] Hospital. Her tylenol
level there was 118. Her LFTs were: ALT 7466 AST 8129, INR 3.8.
She was given dilaudid, phenergan, 7 grams of NAC PO, however
vomited approximately [**12-10**] an hour later. She had an U/S of the
liver that was "basically normal." She was then was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: T 98 HR 130 BP 120/69 RR 16 O2 98%.
On exam she had normal mentation though overall ill appearing.
Her HR ranged 106-130s. She c/o dry heaves and was given ativan
and benadryl. Toxicology was consulted who recommended reloading
of NAC --> 7.5 grams over 1 hour, followed by 50mg/kg (625mg/hr)
over 4 hours, then 100mg/kg (312.5mg/hr) over 16 hours. She also
got benadryl and ativan for nausea. On transfer, vitals were
112, 98% 129/84, 12.

Imaging:
CXR [**2187-9-22**]: Heart size is top EPSTEEPSTEIN-[**Doctor Last Name **] VIRUS EBNA IgG
AB IN-[**Doctor Last Name **] VIRUS EBNA IgG AB normal. Mediastinum is
unremarkable. The right lower lobe consolidation highly
concerning for aspiration or
infection. There is also evidence of interstitial pulmonary
edema that might obscure additional foci of infection.
Evaluation of the patient after diuresis is recommended as well
as addressing the right lower lobe
consolidation again that might represent either aspiration or
pneumonia. No pneumothorax is seen. No appreciable pleural
effusion is seen.

RUQ U/S [**2187-9-22**]: IMPRESSION: Heterogeneous echogenic liver,
consistent with hepatotoxicity.

CXR [**2187-9-23**]:  FINDINGS: Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of
normal in size. Pulmonary vascular engorgement is accompanied by
perihilar haziness, as well as worsening confluent opacities
within the lower lobes. Although the findings may all be
attributed to pulmonary edema related to acetaminophen overdose,
coexisting aspiration is possible.

CXR [**2187-9-27**]: IMPRESSION: 1. Standard position of right PICC at
the cavoatrial junction.  2. Stable moderate bilateral pleural
effusions and mild pulmonary edema. 3. Unchanged confluent
basilar consolidations. Given the clinical history, pneumonia is
possible, though atelectasis and aspiration also within the
differential.

CXR [**2187-9-28**]: New consolidation in the right upper lobe is most
likely pneumonia. Bibasilar consolidation has not cleared since
it was first imaged on [**9-22**] and a mild pulmonary edema and
moderate bilateral pleural effusions worsened slightly. Mild
enlargement of the heart and/or pericardial effusion is stable.
Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 402**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was paged to report these findings at the
time of dictation.

TTE [**2187-9-29**]: The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic pressure is normal. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

CXR [**2187-9-30**]: There are low inspiratory volumes. There is upper
zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent
with CHF. There is more confluent opacity in the right perihilar
area. In addition, at the lung bases, there is bibasilar patchy
opacity consistent with collapse and/or consolidation. Small
effusions cannot be excluded. A right-sided PICC line is
present, the tip is poorly visualized but likely overlies the
proximal/mid SVC.  Compared with [**2187-9-27**] at 2048 p.m., the
findings are similar, allowing for differences in technique.

[**2187-9-30**] Radiology CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST
1. No CT evidence of pancreatitis.
2. Patchy bibasilar consolidation and ground-glass is concerning
for ARDS,
but could represent infection, aspiration, hemorrhage or edema.
3. Small bilateral pleural effusions.

[**2187-10-1**] Radiology CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECON
1. No evidence of PE. 2. Bilateral ground-glass opacities
involving all lobes. In combination with right hilar
lymphadenopathy this is concerning for atypical pneumonia.
Differential diagnosis includes asymmetric pulmonary edema,
aspiration, or ARDS.
