Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute mental status changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Intubation
2. Femoral Central Venous Line


History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA,
HTN, hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED
by her family for lethargy, refusing to eat or get out of bed.
She was recently admitted from [**8-2**] - [**8-7**] for weakness, poor po
intake, fever, and bilateral pleural effusions.  She was
diagnosed with pneumonia and treated with levofloxacin.  Of
note, the family was becoming overwhelmed with the required
care.  Palliative care was consulted, and the family decided not
to pursue aggressive treatment, including intubation/CPR, given
that the patient has previously refused hospital, aggressive
interventions/evaluations.
.
She has full-time care at home and lives with her daughter &
grandson.  At baseline, the patient spends most of her day in
bed, sleeping.  She will wake up to eat.  She ambulates with a
walker to the bathroom.  The extent of her speaking is asking to
go bed.  She does not respond to questions.
.
Upon arrival to the [**Name (NI) **], pt was noted to have agonal breathing.
She was immediately intubated.  After intubation, pt was found
to be pulseless, received CPR for 20 seconds.  A left femoral
CVL was placed (semi-sterile).  Initial blood pressures were up
to 224/150 briefly, then settled in 90s/50s.  HR in 70-80s,
?junctional at one point.  Temp was 99.8 rectally.  Labs were
sig. for WBC 6.3, HCT 33.8, Plt 87, PTT 47, INR 1.5, fibrinogen
104, lactate 9.2.  ABG was 7.24/61/473 on AC 400 x 14, peep 5,
FiO2 100%.  CT head showed no acute process.  CT torso showed
bilateral pleural effusions, R>L, gallstones, heavy
atherosclerotic disease of coronaries and aorta, and
cardiomegaly with marked right atrial enlargement.  Pt received
vanc/zosyn and tylenol.  With 2.7 L IVFs, lactate improved to
4.1

Past Medical History:

Social History:
Pt lives with her daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Known lastname **] and grandson [**Name (NI) 3924**] [**Name (NI) 13260**].
Her granddaughter [**Name (NI) 3040**] [**Name (NI) 13260**] & grandson help care for her.
She stays in bed most of the day.  She never smoked cigarettes,
drank alcohol, or use illicit drugs.

Pertinent Results:
[**8-2**]: CXR
FINDINGS: No previous images. Severe scoliosis of the thoracic
spine.
Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal or slightly
enlarged. No acute focal pneumonia. Opacification at the left
base could reflect some atelectasis and effusion.
.
There are several rib fractures in the left mid zone. No
evidence of
pneumothorax.
.
[**8-2**]: Head CT
IMPRESSION: Slightly motion limited, without evidence of acute
intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.
.
[**8-2**]: Abd/pelvis
1. Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions, with
associated
atelectasis/consolidation of the adjacent lung.
2. Focal outpouching of the aorta at the aortic arch, which
demonstrates a
rim calcification. This likely reflects a pseudoaneurysm, likely
chronic.
3. Diffuse cachexia, with anasarca.
4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
5. Multiple old fractures scattered throughout the pelvis,
lumbar spine, as well as left ribs. No evidence of acute injury.

.
[**8-2**]: Chest CT
1. Moderate-to-large bilateral pleural effusions, with
associated
atelectasis/consolidation of the adjacent lung.
2. Focal outpouching of the aorta at the aortic arch, which
demonstrates a
rim calcification. This likely reflects a pseudoaneurysm, likely
chronic.
3. Diffuse cachexia, with anasarca.
4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.
5. Multiple old fractures scattered throughout the pelvis,
lumbar spine, as well as left ribs. No evidence of acute injury.

.
[**8-10**]: C-spine CT
1. Multilevel degenerative changes, without evidence of
fracture.
2. Left pleural effusion partially visualized.
3. Large left thyroid nodule.
.
[**8-10**]: Head CT
No acute intracranial process. Chronic white matter,
involutional parenchymal, and sinus changes, as detailed above.
.
[**8-10**]: Abd and pelvis/chest

1. No sign of acute traumatic injury in the chest, abdomen, or
pelvis.
2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and relaxation
atelectasis.
3. Mild periportal edema, mesenteric and small amount of free
pelvic fluid, likely related to recent IV hydration.
4. Cardiac enlargement, with marked isolated enlargement of the
right
atrium, with overall appearance suggestive of Ebstein anomaly.
If there has been no prior evaluation, consider echocardiography
to evaluate for structural abnormality.
5. Cholelithiasis.
6. Diffuse atherosclerosis and coronary artery calcifications.
7. Likely old and partially-calcified pseudoaneurysm arising off
the lateral aspect of the apex of the aortic arch.
8. Heterogeneous, enlarged thyroid gland. Correlate with thyroid
function
tests and ultrasound, as clinically indicated.
9. Multiple small pulmonary nodules measure up to 3 mm in size
in the right lower lobe. Without risk factors such as smoking,
or known malignancy, no specific follow-up is necessary.
Otherwise, follow-up with chest CT should be performed in 12
months to evaluate for stability.
10. Hyperenhancing adrenal glands of uncertain significance.
This finding
has been described in the setting of hypoperfusion ("shock")
complex, but
other findings often seen in this setting such as bowel wall
mucosal
hyperenhancement and flattening of the inferior vena cava are
absent.
.
[**8-11**]: Echo
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertens
