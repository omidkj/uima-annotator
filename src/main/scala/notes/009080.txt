Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
fever, cough

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
78F with hx of HTN, dCHF, COPD (?FEV1), CAD, CVA who presents to
the ED with weakness, increased wheezing, fever, shortness of
breath.  Pt's family states that pt was in usual state of health
until 10 days prior to admission when she got a flu shot at her
PCP's office.  Since that time, she has been weak, fatigued with
fevers/chills, nausea and vomiting.  She states that she was
using her inhaler for shortness of breath and wheezing but it
wasn't helping.  [**Name (NI) 1094**] son took her out to dinner on the night
prior to admission and notes that she looked well.  She ate a
good dinner but afterwards, her son reports that she was more
wheezy than her baseline.  He got concerned today when she did
not show up at her hair appointment.  He went to her home and
found her sitting up in her chair, nauseous, weak and wheezing.
She had not yet taken her medications yet for the day.  She was
also complaining of RUQ abdominal pain and short of breath.  He
then took her to the ER.
.
At baseline, pt has a chronic cough productive of white sputum
which has not recently changed in color or frequency.   She is
fully functional, lives alone, performs all of her ADLs, walks
without a walker. Her only residual deficit from her stroke is
right hand weakness and some word finding difficulties. At
baseline, she can only walk up 3-4 steps before getting short of
breath.   She has no recent travel, no sick contacts though her
son recently had a cold.  She coughs occasionally when she eats
and depending on what she is eating.  She sleeps on one big
pillow at home and this has not changed.  No recent medication
changes, no increase in her weight, no change in her diet.  She
denies any diarrhea.
.
In ED, she was found to have a temp of 101 and O2 sat of 88% on
RA.  She pt received ceftriaxone/azithro and flagyl for presumed
PNA.  Pt was then noted to cough up a large amount of blood
streaked sputum though the next sputum was clear of blood.
Given concern for PE a CTA was ordered but pt was hydrated with
1L of NS over 2 hours prior to the study due to her cr of 1.8.
After the fluid bolus, pt became more hypoxic requiring a NRB
and then BiPAP which she did not tolerate.  She received 20mg of
IV lasix x 2 to which she responded poorly to and she was
started on a nitro drip for hypertension to the 180s.  She
continued to have increased work of breathing with a RR of 40
and she asked to be intubated.  On the propofol, she dropped her
pressure to the 80s and she was given Narcan 1mg x 1.  Her
pressure improved to the 100s.  The CTA was cancelled given her
tenuous resp status and she was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].

day x 40 years, stopped in [**2137**]. She lives alone, performs all
her ADLs, drives.  Son and daughter both live nearby

Family History:
grandmother having had valve disease; no hx of early CAD; no
family hx of blood clots

Physical Exam:
Exam: temp 101.6, BP 108/44, HR 107, R 19, O2 96% on AC
400/24/5/100%
ht 5'2", wt 160#
Gen: intubated, agitated, following commands
HEENT: MMM, PERRL
Neck: JVD not appreciable due to neck size
CV: regular, tachy, [**1-28**] holosystolic murmur at RUSB --> carotids
Chest: decreased breath sounds at bilateral bases, R>L; no
wheezing, no crackles heard
Abd: hypoactive bowel sounds, soft, nontender
Ext: no edema, 2+DP
Neuro: intubated but follows commands

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
EKG: NSR, nl axis, PRWP with Q waves in V1-V2; J point elevation
in V1 and V2; compared to prior from [**2137**], V1-V2 J-point is
higher
.
CXR Pa/Lat:
1.    Persistent  bilateral  pleural  effusions.
2.    Advanced  emphysema.
3.    Bibasilar  opacities,  presenting  scarring  versus
atelectasis.
.
pCXR (after fluid bolus): increased interstitial markings
.
[**2143-11-4**] TTE:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect or
patent
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical  quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Left  ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
3. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. The
aortic valve is not well seen. There is mild aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
5. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
6. Comapred to the previous study of [**2142-11-9**], there is
probably no
significant change.

[**2143-11-16**] R UE USN: negative for thrombosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt presented to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with stable SBP, though intubated
electively given increasing respiratory distress after IVF bolus
in anticipation of CTA to evaluate for PE.
.
.
# hypoxia: initial cause of hypoxia felt to be related to
pneumonia, which was exacerbated by component of CHF caused by
fluid hydration in anticipation of CTA to rule out PE in ED.
upon presentation to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], plan was to treat with antibiotics
and gentle diuresis, however exact volume status was unclear,
and SBPs ranged in 80-90s, thus did not appear that pt would
tolerate diuresis.  antibiotic regimen was broadened to from
ceftriaxoneazithro/flagyl to cefipime/azithromycin/flagyl [**11-5**]
after pt spiked fevers (100.4), and pt was treated with
albuterol and atrovent nebulizers for hypoxia.  initial
hemoptysis was felt most likely [**1-24**] to chronic cough and
brochiectasis.  flagyl was d/c'd 11/15 per ID recs, aspiration
felt unlikely.
.
pt's oxygenation initially did not change substantially with
variation in FiO2, raising concerning about shunt physiology,
possibly [**1-24**] pneumonia or CHF.  A TTE was obtained which showed
normal EF, but E/A 0.7, mild MR (though this was felt to be
underestimated on TTE given her murmur), no intracaridac shunt
on bubble study.   CT chest showed bilateral pulmonary
effusions, which were noted on prior CT.  ID consult obtained on
[**11-3**] to evaluate for other sources of infection, however sense
was that the pulmonary process was most likely.  thoracentesis
performed on [**11-8**] which was transudative with ~500 WBC felt
consistent with para-pneumonic effusion.
.
Pt continued to require ventilator support for hypoxia, though
by HD#5, her pneumonia seemed to be resolving (WBC trending
down, afebrile), and pulmonary edema [**1-24**] poor UOP was felt to be
an increasing cause of her hypoxia.  She was started on lasix
gtt on [**11-6**].  this was initially limited by episodes of
hypotension, but was ultimately titrated up to 18 mg/hr on
[**11-16**], with only modest diuresis.  Pt remained +9L on [**11-16**],
with CXR showing persistent pleural effusion/pulmonary edema.
.
On [**11-11**], pt was having low grade temps (100.0), with new
changes in sputum (thick yellow).  Sputum cultures on [**11-5**]
showed GNR, on [**11-8**] and [**11-10**] showed pseudomonas.  Pt was
witched from cefipime to meropenem given concern for resistent
gram negatives on [**11-11**].  Sputum initially cleared, but on [**11-16**]
changed again from white to yellow and thick.  Given concern for
new VAP, low threshold to start vancomycin.
.
On HD#9 and again on HD#14 the possibility of tracheostomy/peg
was discussed with pt's daughter, who is amenable to plan,
