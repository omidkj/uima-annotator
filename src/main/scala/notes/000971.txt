No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 602**]
Chief Complaint:
nausea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
pericardiocentesis


History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 year old Chinese woman with minimal known past
medical history who initially presented yesterday ([**8-5**]) with
four days of naseau and vomiting and no bowel movements.
.
Pt was in her usual state of health until one month ago. She
reportedly worked as temp in a candy shop for 3 days, and had
extreme fatigue that was thought out of her usual condition. She
stopped working afterwards, and later developed a productive
cough, which gradually worsened in the past month. There was no
hemoptysis. Patient was evaluated by her PCP at [**Hospital3 **] on
[**7-21**], and again on [**7-30**]. A PPD was placed on [**7-30**], and
was read on [**8-1**] as nonreactive (completely negative). In the
past week, patient developed shortness of breath, malaise, and
could only ambulate to the bathroom. She c/o nausea, bilious
vomiting, intolerable to po intake. Her family also endorsed
night sweats in the past week, and an 8lbs weight loss in the
past 2 weeks. Of note, patient immigrated to US 10 months ago
from southern [**Country 651**]. She recently visited her daughter in [**Name (NI) 6607**]
two months ago.
During workup in the ED she had a CXR which showed a large
cardiac silloute and fluid overload with possible RML infection.
Her EKG showed diffusely low voltages but no ST depressions.
LFTs showed mild transaminitis (60s) with alk phos 120 with dir
bili 0.6.
.
She was initially treated for CHF, but did not respond well with
diuresis.
On the second day, an RUQ ultrasound in the ED showed a possible
pancreatic head mass (otherwise negative). Surgery recommended
an abdominal CTA with pancreatic protocol to further evaluate.
Overnight she was stable and breathing comfortably on room air.
She was hypertensive to 140s-170s. Vitals otherwise were stable.
On CT, circumferetial pericardial effusion was seen. Patient was
found to have a pulsus paradoxus of 20 mmHg. She was stat
intubated, underwent a pericardiocentesis in the cath lab, and
admitted to CCU.

PERTINENT STUDIES
# [**8-5**], Abd US
IMPRESSION:
1. No cholelithiasis or evidence of acute cholecystitis.
2. Possible pancreatic lesion. Correlate with nonemergent
pancreatic CT or MRI.
.
# [**8-5**], Portable CXR
FINDINGS: There are diffuse bilateral interstitial alveolar
opacities. There is a markedly tortuous aorta. The cardiac
silhouette is enlarged. Small bilateral pleural effusions are
evident. There is no pneumothorax. The osseous structures are
unremarkable.
.
IMPRESSION: Excessive volume overload likely due to cardiogenic
etiology.  Repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis
recommended to assess for underlying infection. In particular,
there is slight confluent opacity in the right perihilar region
which likely reflects confluent edema; however, an underlying
pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
.
# [**2188-8-6**] ECHO (pre-pericardiocentesis)
FOCUSED STUDY: The right ventricular cavity is unusually small.
There is a large pericardial effusion which ranges in size from
2.4 to 3.5 cm. The effusion appears circumferential. There is
right ventricular diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired
fillling/tamponade physiology.
.
# [**2188-8-6**] ECHO (post-pericardiocentesis)
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-8-6**],
the large pericardial effusion has resolved. The heart rate has
normalized. The right ventricular cavity is larger and function
is normal.
.
# [**2188-8-7**], ECHO
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-5 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Trivial pericardial effusion without
echocardiographic evidence of tamponade. Mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.
.
# TTE ([**2188-8-11**])
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is a
very small pericardial effusion. No right atrial or right
ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2188-8-7**], the pericardial effusion
is minimally larger, but remains very small.
.
.
# [**2188-8-7**] ECG
Sinus rhythm. Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the
previous tracing the rate is slower.
.
# [**2188-8-7**] CT chest w/ contrast
IMPRESSION:
1. Right lower lobe mass with centrilobular nodules and
interlobular septal thickening is concerning for primary lung
malignancy with lymphangitic
