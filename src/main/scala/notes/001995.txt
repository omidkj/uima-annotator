Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is an 86 year old woman who came to ED with symptoms
consistent with acute pulmonary edema and was treated as such
with Lasix 40 IV x 2 and a Nitroglycerin drip. Because of a
subsequent drop in her BP, she was placed on BIPAP and dopamine
for blood pressure support and transferred to the CCU.
.
The admission CXR was consistent with diffuse pulmonary edema.
Post diuresis, this significantly improved. In addition, on
physical exam, crackles present on admission were no longer
audible and she continued to have O2 sats in the mid 90s. She
was then weaned off the dopamine and transferred to the floor.
During her first day on the floor, her home Carvedilol, lasix
and lisinopril were all held since her BP was in the 90s. On the
HOD#4, these were restarted at carvedilol 3.125 [**Hospital1 **], lisinopril
5 and lasix 40 PO. And on HOD#5, she was discharged on her home
regimen.
.
During this admission, we also considered whether a
catheterization would be necessary for this woman given her
frequent hospitalizations with pulmonary edema. However, given
the acute reversal of her symptoms and the fact that she did not
reaccumulate fluid on her lungs or develop any signs of
respiratory compromise and no signs of ischemia on her EKG, we
felt that this could be postponed for now. She did have a
slighly elevated troponin, but this was felt to be [**1-4**] to
stress.
We did not feel that her lasix required uptitrating as she did
not reaccumulate fluid after being off lasix for 2 full days
during the hospitalization. She was discharged on her home
medications. In addition, clopidogrel was added to her regimen
in the event that these events were due to ischemia.
.
Nutrition was asked to educate the patient on the necessity of
adhering to a low salt diet and to restrict her fluid intake to
prophylax against reaccumulating fluid. She was evaluated by
physical therapy and was fit to return to her [**Hospital3 **]
facility. I had a conversation with her son regarding the
possibility that the patient may be at a point where she
requires more intensive care than could be provided by an
[**Hospital3 **] facility and he was in the process of looking
into nursing homes for his mother.
.
Pt is DNR/DNI. Despite this, we felt that a catheterization
would not be unreasonable in the future if she continues to have
these episodes as patient has a fairly good level of
functioning.
