Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain and shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 97-yo Russian-speaking man w/ h/o CAD s/p BMS
[**11/2122**] and angioplasty [**5-/2123**], CHF (EF 40%), HTN, h/o GI
bleeding and colon Ca, who presented to the ED for evaluation of
chest pain. CP consistently 4-5x/day both with exertion and at
rest, always responding to SL NTG. Pt saw his cardiologist on
the day PTA, at which point the decision was made to pursue
optimization of medical management rather than interventions.
However, on the morning of admission, the pt developed more
severe chest pain with radiation to the left shoulder, assoc w/
SOB and diaphoresis, non-responsive to SL NTG, so he came to the
ED for evaluation. In the ED - VS Temp 97.8F, HR 100, BP 85/53,
R 18, O2-sat 100. Hct 20 (baseline 28), with Guaiac + brown
stool. The pt reported dark stools x3 months, and has never been
scoped [**2-13**] cardiac risk factors. The pt was started on PRBCs for
transfusion, but he developed chest pain and diaphoresis, so the
transfusions were stopped for concern for a transfusion
reaction. Per the blood bank there was no evidence of a
transfusion reaction. The pt was seen by Cardiology, who wanted
to continue ASA / Plavix but not start heparin gtt. Upon
transfer to the floor, the pt triggered for HR 130s and RR >30.
He had 2/10 chest pain with ECG showing worsening ST depressions
precordially, which resolved with Nitro gtt and Lopressor. He
then received an additional 2units PRBCs + Lasix.
.
At 1230 am pt noted by nursing to have BP 50's/30's on automatic
cuff, mentating well, asymptomatic.  Of note he had been given
lasix 20mg IV x1 at 8pm when he was noted to be tachypnic to
30's, O2 sat 93-94% on 3-4L, diffuse crackles and expiratory
wheezing with chest xray per the radiology resident showing
worsened pulmonary edema compared with admission.  He responded
well to lasix with resolution of respiratory distress and put
out 600+ ml of urine with blood pressures 110-120.  At 8pm he
was given amlodipine 2.5mg.  At 11pm he was given metoprolol
37.5mg and terazosin 1mg.  At 12:30 he was noted to be
hypotensive as above on bp check.  Recheck with manual cuff with
blood pressure of 70's/40's, HR 70-73, RR 18, 97% on 2L NC.  He
was given 500ml NS with improvement of SBP to 76.  At that time
he had completed his second unit PRBC and his third unit was
started.  Of note he had a large melanotic stool in the early
evening.  After observing for 30-40 minutes blood pressure
remained in the low 70's systolic so he was given an additional
250ml NS.  He remained asymptomatic throughout.  EKG showed
improvement in precordial ST segment depressions compared with
admission.

[**2123-8-31**] Chest Xray:Mild pulmonary edema has worsened, small
right pleural effusion and mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly stable.
No pneumothorax. No free subdiaphragmatic gas.

[**2123-9-3**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 0-10mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %) with infero-lateral
hypokinesis. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets
are severely thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve
stenosis (area 1.0-1.2cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 95893**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with PMH of severe CAD s/p multiple
prior PCI, moderate aortic stenosis, daily angina, anemia due to
chronic GI blood loss admitted with NSTEMI and hematocrit of 21.
.
1) NSTEMI/severe CAD- He has significant CAD hx s/p numerous
percutaneous interventions and stenting previously.  He
presented with chest pain, worsening ECG findings with marked
precordial ST segment depressions and uptrending cardiac
enzymes.  He was initially started on a nitroglycerin gtt and
was transferred to the floor with persistant chest pain.  He was
given metoprolol 5mg IV x1 which resolved his hypertension,
tachycardia and chest pain.  His hematocrit was noted to be 21
which was the likely causing factor of his worsening symptoms.
Given the severity of his symptoms and his multiple prior PCI he
was continued on his aspirin and plavix despite his GI blood
loss.  Heparin was not started given the significant risk of
worsening his blood loss.  Otherwise he was continued on maximal
medical manageme
