CXR [**12-14**]:
FINDINGS: Compared with 11/22 and [**2174-11-17**], no infiltrates or
other acute process identified.
.
Chest CT [**12-14**]:IMPRESSION:
1. Mild emphysematous changes.
2. No evidence of large central pulmonary embolism. Evaluation
of the smaller peripheral branches is limited by significant
motion artifact.
3. Stable partially calcified small pulmonary nodule.
.
Bilateral lower extremity venous ultrasound:No evidence of deep
vein thrombosis..
.
Echo [**12-15**]: Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left  ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests
impaired relaxation. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of [**2171-3-25**], mild left ventricular hypertrophy and
evidence of impaired
relaxation is now noted.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 57 year old woman with history of asthma/COPD presents with
an exacerbation.
.
*Asthma/COPD exacerbation:  Patient was admitted with worsening
SOB and DOE. In the ED her peak flows were 230 to 275, and she
was given 60 of PO prednisone. She also was given Levaquin 500mg
PO x1 empirically and 1L of NS. She did not have significant
improvement after albuterol/atrovent nebs every 45-60 mins, and
was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring of a presumed
Asthma axacerbation.
.
In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] she was treated with albuterol nebs q2 hours PRN,
prednisone 60mg daily in addition to her usual home regimen. She
was also continued on Levaquin empirically, which was dc'd on
[**12-16**] b/c patient did not have elevated WBC or fevers. Initially
she was on a NRB but was weaned down to 2 L NC O2 with sats in
the upper 90s to 100s. Had CTA to r/o PE, which was negative,
echo showed nl EF with no significant valvular disease and EKG
showed no changes.
.
She was then transferred to the floor. While she was more wheezy
than at baseline she felt much better than she did when she was
admitted and improved over several days. Peak flows were stable
at 290's and O2 sats stable on low levels of supplemental O2.
Exacerbation could have been secondary to viral URI that was
resolving. Some component may have been related to her severe
GERD.  She was continued on prednisone 60mg daily, cromolyn,
beclomethasone nasal, advair, zafirluekast, prn ipratroium nebs
and albuterol nebs q2h prn. She was also continued on ranitidine
and protonix for her GERD. She was discharged on a 14 day
prednisone taper with scheduled f/u with pulmonary. She was also
set-up with outpatient pulmonary rehab.
.

*DIABETES: She was continued on Metformin initially, but that
was dc'd prior to CTA.  She also continued on insulin ss and 38
U Glargine qd. Her metformin was re-started prior to d/c.
.
*PLEURITIC CP: Had some CP at admission that was likely related
to asthma flare and associated with coughing. Also less likely
cardiac given negative Mibi [**1-4**] and EKG showed no evidence of
ischemia. No evidence of DVT/PE was seen on LENI and CTA done on
[**2174-12-15**] showed no PE. CP resolved by discharge.
.
Patient was discharged to home with pulmonary rehab
