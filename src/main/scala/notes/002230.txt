Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1283**]
Chief Complaint:
Cough, dyspnea on exertion

TEE
Aortic and mitral valve replacement

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 22 yo male who presents with worsening cough and
DOE x 3 weeks. His initial symptoms included a nonproductive
cough associated with SOB with exercise. At baseline he is very
active but now becomes dyspnic with 1 flight of stairs. The
cough is worse at night and when lying flat. Reports poor PO
intake over this time with a 25 pound weight loss and drenching
night sweats x 1 week but no fevers or chills. Also had 4-5 days
watery brown diarrhea (non-bloody) last week without abdominal
pain. He was seen at [**Hospital 778**] clinic today and noted to have new
harsh holosystolic murmur and sent to ED for evaluation.

In the ED, noted to be febrile to 102F. CXR w/ bilateral diffuse
interstitial infiltrates. TTE revealed severe LV dilatation,
preserved EF, aortic and mitral vegetations with moderate AR and
severe MR. 3 sets blood cultures were sent. Received vancomycin,
ceftriaxone, and gentamycin. Admitted to CCU for close
monitoring.

Denies h/o IVDU, blood transfusion, needle sticks, or recent
illness. Reports dental cleaning 4 months prior. Had unconfirmed
strep throat approximately 9 months ago. Endorses PND but no
orthopnea or edema. No palpitations, syncope, or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
ECG ([**9-24**]): sinus tach, 105bpm, normal axis and intervals, no
ST-T changes

Relevant Imaging:
1)CXR ([**9-24**]):  Diffuse bilateral interstitial prominence which
given this patient's new heart murmur may represent interstitial
edema from congestive heart failure. Differential diagnosiis
includes an infectious process especially viral pneumonitis
Correlate clinically, with echocardiography and follow up.

2)TTE ([**9-24**]): The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
Three distinct aortic valve leaflets are not clearly seen. The
aortic valve may be bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are
thickened and deformed. There is a large vegetation on the
aortic valve. Moderate aortic regurgitation is seen. There is a
large (1.3 x .2 cm) vegetation on the mitral valve. Severe
mitral regurgitation is seen. There may be a mitral valve
perforation. There is a trivial / physiologic pericardial
effusion.

3)TEE ([**9-26**]): The left atrium is normal in size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending, transverse and descending
thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve is bicuspid. There is a
large vegetation on the aortic valve that prolapses into the
left ventricular outflow tract. No aortic valve abscess is seen.
Moderate to severe (3+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
anterior mitral leaflet is aneurysmal with perforation in it and
vegetations on it. No mitral valve abscess is seen. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen (via perforation).
There is no pericardial effusion.

4)CT Head ([**9-26**]): No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or
intraparenchymal changes to suggest septic emboli.

5)CT Abdomen & Pelvis ([**9-26**]):No radiographic evidence of septic
emboli sequelae within the abdomen. No evidence of small bowel
obstruction. Splenomegaly.

6)CT Chest w/o contrast: 1. No radiographic evidence of
esophageal perforation. Oral contrast is present within the
stomach with no evidence of contrast or air elsewhere within the
mediastinum. 2. Bilateral interstitial and air space opacities
predominantly within the lower lobes along with bilateral
pleural effusions likely a component of pulmonary edema.

7)EGD ([**10-1**]):Inflammatory exudate with mucosal sloughing was
seen throughout the esophagus. This is consistant with a
infectous or inflammatory process, fungal being the most likely.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 68464**] is a 22 yo male who presented with a 3 week h/o
fever, SOB, new murmur, aortic and mitral valvular vegetations
on ECHO c/w subacute native-valve endocarditis.
.
1) Endocarditis: Patient was found to have large aortic and
mitral valve vegetations on TTE on admission, which was
consistent with patient's history of fever, cough and new murmur
on physical exam. He was started on Vancomycin, gentamycin, and
ceftriaxone in the ED and ID was consulted. CT surgery was also
consulted and felt that patient was a surgical candidate based
on vegetation size and LV dysfunction. Blood cultures ([**1-8**]
bottles) grew strep viridans. CT scan of the head, abdomen, and
pelvis did not suggest any septic emboli. TEE was done but no
abcess was seen. Surveillance cultures since then have been
negative. Gentamycin and ceftriaxone were d/c'[**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ID, and he
was maintained on Vancomycin. After the sensitivities were
available the Vancomycin was changed to Ceftriaxone 2gm IV. He
will require at least 6 weeks of therapy from the last positive
blood culture. Daily EKGs were done and did not suggest PR
prolongation or AVB. Patient will undergo aortic and mitral
valve replacement on [**2166-10-6**].

He was taken to the operating room on [**2166-10-6**] where he
underwent an AVR with (27/29 onyx mechanical aortic valve, and
MVR with 31/33 onyx mechanical mitral valve. He was transferred
to the SICU in critical but stable condition. He was extubated
later that same day. He continued on ceftriaxone for his
endocarditis. He was weaned from his vasoactive drips and
transferred to the floor on POD#1. He did well postoperatively.
He was started on heparin and coumadin for his double mechanical
valves. He remained in the hospital awaiting a therapeutic INR
and was ready for discharge on [**10-20**].
