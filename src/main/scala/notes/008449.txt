History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 82969**] is a 82 year-old Russian speaking woman who was
brought in to the Emergency Department by her husband and home
social worker after suspected overdose on temazepam and/or
oxycodone. History given by her husband is as follows. Ms.
[**Known lastname 82969**] has been suffering from depression, insomnia and chronic
pain issues for a long time. She normally takes oxycodone for
pain and temazepam each night for sleep. This morning, her
husband noticed she was sleeping quite heavily but he decided to
let her rest as she normally sleeps late. A home social worker
arrived around 10am, after which Mr. [**Known lastname 82969**] heard a loud BOOM!
When he entered the room, he saw Ms. [**Known lastname 82969**] on the floor. She
was unresponsive to voice and shaking. She had been "out of it"
the whole time and was slurring words/ had garbled speech. It
was unclear how many pills (and of what) she took the night
before. Mr. [**Known lastname 82969**] noticed her bottle of temazepam was empty
this morning and he felt she should have had about 7 or 8 left
since she filled it the 1st of the month. He is not sure if she
took any oxycodone the night before but certainly knows that she
does not drink any alcohol. Ms. [**Known lastname 82969**] did not have any
tongue-biting, lip-smacking or urinary/fecal incontinence.
Although her depression had been worsening over the past few
weeks, she did not specifically tell her husband she wanted to
hurt herself or others, although she had been complaining alot
recently and saying things like "i am tired of everything, i am
tired of living in pain, etc.." Her husband feels that "old
people say these kinds of things all the time" and initially
thought nothing of it, but is afraid she may have taken an
intentional overdose. Further details are unclear. Of note, she
has been taking 50mg HCTZ daily when she had been instructed to
take 12.5mg daily.
Arrived to [**Hospital1 18**] ED obtunded, garbled speech, localizing to pain
but no eye opening. Vitals: 98.8 177/75 70 25 100%RA. Exam with
some RLQ tenderness, guaiac neg. Intubated for airway
protection. Therapeutic INR for Afib. Trop minimally elevated,

Imaging:
CT C-spine ([**11-17**]):
1. No acute cervical spine fracture.
2. Degenerative changes with posterior disc-osteophyte complex
at C6-C7 level causing mild spinal canal narrowing at that
level, which increases risk of cord injury. If clinical concern
for cord injury, MRI of the cervical spine is more sensitive.
3. Bilateral lung apices show septal thickening, may be related
to fluid
overload.

CT head ([**11-17**]):
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.
2. Small focal left parieto-occipital scalp hematoma/soft tissue
swelling.

CT torso ([**11-17**]):
1. Endotracheal tube tip in the right mainstem bronchus,
recommended
withdrawing approximately 5 cm.
2. Bilateral small pleural effusions and small pericardial
effusion.
3. Focal area of hyperenhancement in the hepatic [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
represent a
vascular malformation vs flash-filling hemangioma. Findings can
be further
characterized on ultrasound.
4. Collapsed bowel, with prominence of the ascending colon and
hepatic
flexure, mild bowel wall thickening/underlying injury can not be
excluded.
5. Bilateral breast calcifications. Recommend correlation with
mammography.

Plain films pelvis ([**11-17**]):
No evidence of acute fracture or dislocation.

Plain films shoulder ([**11-17**]):
Three views of the left shoulder are submitted. A left-sided
pacer is
present. No fracture or dislocation identified. There are mild
degenerative changes of the glenohumeral joint and
acromioclavicular joint. There is 8-mm distance between the
acromion and the clavicle top normal size for the AC joint. If
there is concern regarding acromioclavicular joint sprain,
weightbearing views may be performed.

CXR ([**11-18**]):
Endotracheal tube has been pulled back in the interval, and is
now
approximately 4 cm from the carina, in appropriate position.
Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the expected position of
the diaphragm; however, distal aspect is not fully included on
the image. Left-sided triple lead pacer device is unchanged in
position change given change in patient position. There is
increased right lower lobe opacity, suggesting increase in small
right pleural effusion seen on prior CT, although underlying
consolidation not excluded. There is also left basilar opacity
which may represent atelectasis as well as possible effusion.
There is minimal pulmonary vascular
