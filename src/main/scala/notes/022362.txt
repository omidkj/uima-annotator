Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2195**]
Chief Complaint:
Post-operative Observation s/p Subtotal Parathyroidectomy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Subtotaled parathyroidectomy right thyroid lobectomy.


History of Present Illness:
This is an 81 year old male with PMH of non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an EF=25% on his last ECHO [**9-21**], ESRD on HD
with related anemia, HTN, h/o of prostate cancer s/p radical
prostatectomy in 2/94, and secondary/tertiary
hyperparathyroidism who presented for an elective subtotal
parathyroidectomy in the setting of remarkably elevated PTH
levels documented since [**2138**], failure of medical management due
to patient compliance issues, and development of renal
osteodystrophy.  His peak PTH level was 1498 (normal 15-65) in
[**2-23**] and his PTH on admission was 999.  He also has renal
osteodystrophy with imaging notable for a Rugger-Jersey spine.
He has been on HD for the last 14 years through an AV fistula in
his left arm.

On arrival to the ICU, his initial vitals were T: 95.3, BP:
228/95, P: 104, R: 10, and O2: 100% on 2L NC.  The patient was
extremely lethargic, but was able to relay that he had a
headache and central chest pain.  The surgery team transferred
the patient for closer monitoring given his multiple medical
comorbidities s/p a subtotal parathyroidectomy of his right
thyroid lobe with no significant blood loss.  He arrived
extubated and fatigued with a PIV in place from the OR for IVF
administration as well as a femoral A-line for BP monitoring.
HE received about 1 Liter of fluid intra/post-op.  It was also
recommended that he recieve no blood thinners given his recent
surgery to a hypervascular area.

Review of sytems:
Patient endorses headache and chest pain, the remainder of ROS
was limited by lethargy and inattentiveness.

Past Medical History:
1. ESRD
- [**2-15**] prolonged obstructive uropathy in setting of prostate CA
- hemodialysis M/W/F
- thrombectomy of avg [**12-19**]
2. Secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism with renal
osteodystrophy noted in [**2-23**] with imaging notable for
Rugger-Jersey spine
3. Anemia related to ESRD with baseline HCT in hte mid 30s on
Epogen
4. HTN
5. Non-ischemic Cardiomyopathy of unclear etiology-last echo
[**9-21**] with EF=25%, global hypokinesis
- cardiac catheterization in [**2145**]: minor coronary irregularities

6. NSVT first noted in [**2151**]
7. Prostate CA s/p radical prostatectomy & LN dissection in 2/94


Social History:
He grew up in a [**Doctor Last Name **] family and worked in maintenance at the
Rat Cellar night club for 22 years. Prior to his last admission
in [**Month (only) 958**], he was living in senior housing and getting his meals
from the cafeteria there. He was otherwise independent in his
ADLs and walking without assistance. After his last discharge he
has been staying at [**Hospital **] Healthcare Center. Denied tobacco,
alcohol, and recreational drug use in the past.

Family History:
unknown, grew up in [**Doctor Last Name **] home

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 81 year old male with PMH of non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an EF=25% on his last ECHO [**9-21**], ESRD on HD
with related anemia, HTN, h/o of prostate cancer s/p radical
prostatectomy in 2/94, and secondary hyperparathyroidism
underwent an elective subtotal parathyroidectomy [**2152-5-26**] (see
operative note for details) who was admitted to the ICU
post-operatively in the setting of remarkably elevated PTH
levels documented since [**2138**], failure of medical management due
to patient compliance, and development of renal osteodystrophy
admitted to the ICU post-op for closer monitoring given his
multiple medical comorbities.

# Hypertensive Urgency/Emergency: The patient arrived to the ICU
with a BP=228/95 and a HR=104 complaining of headache and chest
pain. Metoprolol IV  did not appreciably effect BP/HR.
Therefore, a labetalol drip was started. EKG obtained which was
not significantly changed from baseline. The labetalol drip was
ultimately weaned down and stopped once the patient's BP was
better controlled. The patient was also noted to be due for HD
on the day of admission. He underwent HD while in the ICU, which
also helped with his hypertension. On the floor, the patient was
still hypertensive, which was poorly controlled with metoprolol
10mg IV Q6H. He was transitioned to PO tartrate then eventually
Metoprolol XL 100mg PO daily. Valsartan 20mg PO daily was added,
then was increased to 40mg PO daily. His pressures had improved
control. Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] is to follow his pressures at HD and
make adjustments accordingly. Pt to hold antihypertensives until
after HD session on HD days and to hold for SBP>120.

# Hyperparathyroidism: The patient has had known
hyperparathyroidism since [**2138**] secondary to ESRD. He has failed
medical management likely due to poor compliance with his meds.
He was admitted for an elective subtotal parathyroidectomy and
his PTH level was 999 prior to surgery. [**Name (NI) **] PTH was
significantly improved. However, pt's post-operative course was
characterized by persistently low calcium levels, requiring
repeated IV calcium repletion. His post-operative course was
also complicated by throat pain with difficulty tolerating PO
intake. This resolved on its own.

# ESRD on HD: Renal was consulted. HD was performed post-op with
increased zemplar dosing and increased calcium bath. The
patient's home sensipar was discontinued, and his home renvela
was decreased. Was continued on novasource renal supplements
with each meal.

# Hypocalcemia: Patient, with total calcium nadir of 7.2.
Patient's calcium normalized after several days of intensive
calcium repletion with calcium carbonate 1000mg PO TID plus
calcium gluconate IV. He should have his calcium checked at
hemodialysis (he is also scheduled to have calcium baths in his
diasylate there) and have his blood calcium levels checked at
each dialysis and repleted with calcium gluconate as needed.

# Nonischemic cardiomyopathy/NSVT.  The patient has an EF=25% on
his most recent ECHO [**9-21**]. Volume management per HD, with goal
of negative 2L during most sessions.  Held aspirin given recent
surgery, restarted on POD 5.

# Hip Pain - Restart home regimen of acetaminophen and Lidoderm
patches if symptomatic, otherwise current dosing of
morphine/oxycodone should be sufficient. His hip pain seemed to
disappear, seeming to suggest that it may have been bony pain
secondary to his tertiary hyperparathyroidism leading to renal
osteodystrophy.

# GERD. Continue home PPI and H2 blocker.
