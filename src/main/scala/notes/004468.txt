History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 95455**] [**Known lastname 95456**] is a 71-year-old right-handed man with DM, CAD
s/p IMI, chronic diastolic CHF, malignant hypertension, and
recent diagnosis of right frontotemporal GBM, s/p biopsy on
[**2131-9-18**] who presented to the [**Hospital6 33**] ED from
rehabilitation after complaining of SOB and headache.  Vital
signs at 20:45 on [**2131-10-12**]:  blood pressure 210/110, pulse 80,
respiration 24, oxygen saturation 80% in room air, and 90% with
4 liters of air.  Breathing appeared labored but he did not
complain of chest pain.  BP en route was 241/142.  He then
received [**2-17**] ampule of D50 for hypoglycemia in 50s.  Initial
vital signs at [**Hospital6 33**] was blood pressure 188/132,
pulse 74, respiration 23, and oxygen saturation 97% on
non-rebreather mask.  A head CT showed heterogenous
frontotemporal mass with partial effacement of right lateral
ventricle with surrounding vasogenic edema but no midline shift,
and intratumoral hemorrhage could not be excluded.  He was then
given Decadron 10 mg IV and Ativan 2 mg IV.  He also received
vecuronium 10 mg IV x 2, etomidate 20 mg IV, and
succhinylcholine 100 mg IV, and intubated for respiratory
failure attributed to acute CHF based on chest X-ray.  He also
received 2" nitro paste and Lasix 80 mg IV.  After that, he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgery evaluation.  He was also
hypotensive to 60/p systolic en route, up to SBP 89 after
removal of nitro paste.  In the ED, initial vital signs were
temperature 97.6 F, pulse 72, blood pressure 179/91, and oxygen
saturation at 94% on ventilation.  Finger-stick glucose was 110.
 Chest X-ray showed ETT 4.6 cm above carina, near complete
opacification of the left hemithorax with a large left effusion
and compressive atelectasis, and bilateral pulmonary edema.
Another head CT showed stable appearance to right
temporoparietal lobe with edema and mass effect but no shift,
and stable foci of hemorrhage.  ABG was 7.32/61/114 on 16 x 500
8 1.0.  His ventilation rate was increased to 20/min. Blood
cultures sent, given levaquin 750 mg IV, started on propofol
gtt.

NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: His Karnofsky Performance Score is 60.
 He is awake, alert, and oriented to person, hospital, but not
date.  His language is fluent with good comprehension.
Short-term recall seems intact.  Cranial Nerve Examination:  His
right pupil is reactive to light, 3 mm to 2 mm in OD, but the
left is not.  Extraocular movements are full, but the left eye
is light detection only.  Visual field in OD is full to
confrontation.  He has a left lower facial droop.  Facial
sensation is intact bilaterally.  His hearing is intact
bilaterally.  His tongue is midline.  Palate goes up in the
midline.  Sternocleidomastoids and upper trapezius are strong.
Motor Examination:  He has a drift in the left upper extremity.
His muscle strengths are [**6-20**] at all muscle groups, except for
4/5 strength in left delotid, [**5-21**] in left biceps, and 4-/5 at
left triceps.  There is also 4/5 strength in the left handgrip,
left
finger extensors, left biceps, left triceps, and left deltoid.
His left proximal lower extremity strength is 4+/5.  His muscle
tone is normal.  His reflexes are absent bilaterally.  His ankle
jerks are absent.  His right toe is down but the left is up.
Sensory examination is intact to touch and proprioception.
Coordination examination reveals dysmetria on the left side
commensurate with the degree of weakness.  He can walk and his
balance is good.
