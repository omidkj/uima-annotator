Radiology:
Xray of L hip ([**11-18**]):
IMPRESSION:
Impacted right femoral neck fracture with varus configuration.
Remainder of the right femur appears normal.
.
Xray s/p surgery ([**11-19**]) FINDINGS: There is a new right hip
prosthesis in good location. Gas is seen in the soft tissues.
.
CXR ([**11-20**]):
FINDINGS: Cardiomediastinal contours are without change allowing
for lower
lung volumes on the current study. New hazy opacity has
developed at the left base, with lack of definition of lateral
costophrenic sulcus, most likely due to acute pleural effusion.
If there has been history of fall, consider left rib series to
exclude the possibility of rib fractures adjacent to this
region. No pneumothorax.
.
Fluro PICC placement ([**11-21**]):
IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated fluoroscopically guided PICC line
exchange for a
new 5 French double lumen PICC line. Final internal length is 49
cm, with the tip positioned in the SVC. The line is ready to
use.
.
ECHO (TTE [**11-22**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
0-10mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
depressed free wall contractility. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic
valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is severe mitral annular calcification. There
is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 5 mmHg) due to
mitral annular calcification. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal LV systolic function. Dilated and hypokinetic right
ventricle. Moderate calcific aortic stenosis. Mild mitral
stenosis due to annular calcification. Moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2197-10-24**],
the current study is more complete. As a result, the degrees of
aortic and mitral stenosis can be assessed. The right ventricle
appears dilated and hypokinetic on the current study.
.
CTA of lungs ([**11-23**]):
FINDINGS:
A right upper extremity peripherally inserted central venous
catheter tip
terminates in the distal superior vena cava. There is no
pathologic
enlargement of the axillary or supraclavicular lymph nodes.
Prominent lymph nodes in both hilar stations measure up to 9 mm
on the right and 6 mm on the left (4:31, 34). The esophagus is
thick walled throughout without evidence of dilatation. Small
bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral lower lobe
atelectasis.

A filling defect in the subsegmental left lower lobe artery is
consistent with an isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism.The
pulmonary artery is mildly enlarged measuring 34 mm in
transverse dimension (normal <30
