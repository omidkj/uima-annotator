Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5134**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness and fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 61 yo F with undifferentiated carcinoma in lung and
liver who presents from an OSH after a fall at home. Of note,
patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] from [**12-18**] -[**12-25**] with
nausea and vomiting, thought to be due to his underlying
malignancy. His hospital course was complicated by a code STEMI
which was due to a moderate size pericardial effusion requiring
a brief stay in the CCU. Pleural effusion was never tapped.
Patient was set up to see outpatient oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1852**]
after discharge to discuss outpatient chemotherapy, but has not
been to his appointment yet because he states he overslept that
day.
.
Patient reports that he has been feeling more weak and tired at
home. he has not been eating and drinking well due to anorexia
and lack of appetitite, and reports eating on average about 1
meal a day, usually only a [**Location (un) 6002**]. He was at home when he felt
he 'lost his balance' and fell to his knees the day of
admission. No head strike. Denies any chest pain, palpitation,
SOB, LH, or syncope prior to, during, or after the episode. Did
not loose his bowels or bladder. No seizure activity. Pt was not
getting any PT at home. He states due to his fatigue he does not
walk around very much and mostly lies in bed or sits in a chair
all day. Pt also with some nausea and vomiting, but fairly well
controlled with his prochlorperazine, and last episode was a few
days ago. He presented to an OSH ([**Hospital3 417**]) where a CXR
demonstrated a new pleural effusion. Given 1 gram of Vancomycin
and 1 gram of CFTX at OSH.  He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED
for further management.
.
In the ED, VS were: 100.9 100 102/61 22 96% 3L. Labs sig for WBC
of 48.3 (43.1 on discharge on [**12-25**]), Hct of 22.5, lactate of
2.6, INR of 1.4. Received no IVFs, Flagyl 500 mg IV x1, and 60
mEQ of PO K in the Ed. While there, pt had one episode of AF
with RVR to the 180s with associated hypotension with systolics
down to 80s. RVR broke with 10 of IV diltiazem and he was given
30 mg PO diltiazem immediately afterwards. Pulsus measured as
[**7-24**]. Bedside TTE done by ED showed moderate sized pericardial
effusion with no evidence of tamponade physiology. CCU fellow
was consulted for possible CCU admission, but did not think the
current pericardial effusion was large enough to warrant CCU
admission for pericardiocentesis or STAT TTE and declined the
admission. Heme-onc fellow was also consulted and declined OMED
admission given recent medicine admit and that the patient had
not yet established care with his new oncologist, and that
chemotherapy would be unlikely at this time.

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
EKG: SR, 98 BPM, normal axis, normal intervals, TWF in III, AVF,
AVL, V5, V6

EKG [**1-7**]:
Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. ST-T wave
abnormalities. Since the previous tracing of [**2193-1-3**] there is
atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. ST-T wave
abnormalities are new. Clinical correlation is suggested.

EKG [**1-16**]: Sinus tachycardia with atrial premature beats and
ventricular premature beat. Modest low amplitude T wave changes
are non-specific. Since the previous tracing of [**2193-1-7**] ectopy
is now present.

Imaging:
CXR - [**2193-1-1**] - Large R sided pleural effusion, appear slightly
worsened compared to [**2192-12-22**] CXR.

CXR [**1-16**]:
1. Persistent right basilar opacification and increased extent
of lobulated
pleural opacities suggesting enlarging pleural-based fluid
collections and
possibly burden of metastatic disease.

2. Generalized but somewhat heterogeneous mild new opacification
of the right
lung in conjunction with increasing pleural opacities, which may
represent
atelectasis, the result of lymphatic obstruction, although
pneumonia is not
excluded.

[**2192-12-18**] CT ABD W CONTRAST: 1. Progression of large complex
hepatic lesion which now occupies greater than 60% of the
hepatic parenchyma. Findings are concordant with recent biopsy
results of poorly differentiated carcinoma. At this point, there

are no imaging features suggestive of abscess. 2. Increase in
size and of numerous pulmonary nodules seen on limited views of
the lung bases. 3. New appearance of multiple mesenteric
implants suggestive of metastatic disease.

TTE ([**2191-12-23**]): Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small to
moderate sized pericardial effusion, primarily anterior to the
right ventricle. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Small to moderate-sized pericardial effusion without
echocardiographic signs of tamponade. Normal global and regional
biventricular systolic function

TTE ([**2192-1-4**])
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is small. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is a moderate to large
sized pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. There is brief right atrial diastolic collapse
and brief diastolic invagination of the right ventricular free
wall.

IMPRESSION: findings are consistent with early cardiac tamponade

CT ([**2192-1-3**])
FINDINGS: The aorta opacifies normally without evidence of
dissection. The
pulmonary arteries opacify normally without intraluminal filling
defects to suggest pulmonary embolism. The heart is normal in
size. A new pericardial effusion is moderate in severity,
causing straightening of the ventricular septum and distortion
and attenuation of the right atrium, concerning for tamponade
physiology. No pericardial nodularity is identified. Multiple
mediastinal lymph nodes are new or enlarged including
