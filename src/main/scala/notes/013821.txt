History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 53899**] is a 64 year old female with CAD, depression, CHF,
and chronic pain who presented to [**Hospital3 4107**] today after
syncope x 2. Patient reports that her legs "gave out" while she
was in the kitchen last night and that she hit her head on the
kitchen counter but did not remember wheter she had LOC. She

at a coffee shop. She described feeling light headed and
nauseous and subsequently lost consciousness in the car while it
was parked. EMS was called by passerbys and the patient was
taken to OSH ED ambulance
.
Initial vital signs at OSH ED were 97.9 77 123/70 18 98% on RA.
Repeat vital signs at OSH ED revelaed BP as low as 94/53 with HR
of 72 for which she received 2L of NS IV. Serum toxicology
screen and ammonia levels were negative. CT head and neck
imaging were reassuring and her head laceration was stapled.
Following admission to [**Hospital3 4107**], the decision was made to
transfer her to [**Hospital1 18**] for consideration of ICD placement.
.
On arrival to the floor, the patient is comfortable and without
additional complaints.
.

PERTINENT STUDIES
ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2113-9-30**]
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top
normal/borderline dilated. There is moderate regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to distal septal,
anterior and apical akinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
CT chest/abd/pelvis: [**2113-10-8**] IMPRESSION:  1. Multiple bilateral
pulmonary emboli. Evidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension
and concern for right ventricular strain. 2. Small residual
right pneumothorax with chest tube in place. 3. More
consolidative changes in the right lower lobe. Early developing
pneumonia is not excluded. 4. Enlarged liver with mottled
enhancement pattern and periportal edema suggestive of
congestive hepatopathy. Perihepatic and pelvic ascites. 5.
Splenic infarct. 6. Generalized anasarca.
.
LENI [**2113-10-9**]: IMPRESSION: 1. Occlusive thrombus within the left
profunda femoris vein which extends into the common femoral vein
where there is partial, non-occlusive thrombus. 2. No right
lower extremity DVT.
.
CXR [**2113-10-12**]: IMPRESSION: 1. Further withdrawal of the
endotracheal tube, clinical correlation is recommended. 2.
Improvement of right basilar atelectasis and left basilar
pleural effusion, atelectasis, and consolidation. 3. Stable
right apical pneumothorax.
.
RUQ US: [**2113-10-6**]: IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for cholecystitis. 2. Thickened gallbladder wall,
bilateral pleural effusions, trace perihepatic ascites,
hepatomegaly and dilated hepatic veins/IVC compatible with fluid
overload and congestive failure, with the patient's pain perhaps
relating to congestive hepatopathy.
.
RUQ US: [**2113-10-13**]: Preliminary read: No cholecystitis, CBD not
dilated, gall bladder edema present but improved in comparison
to prior.
