ECHO [**2116-2-4**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with severe hypokinesis/akinesis of the
inferior, inferolateral and inferoseptal walls, and hypokinesis
of the apex, c/w multivessel CAD. [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of
valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size is
normal. with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. A very eccentric, posteriorly
directed jet of [**Location (un) **] (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen, likely
on the basis of the posteromedial papillary muscle dysfunction.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with moderate regional
systolic dysfunction, c/w multivessel CAD. Severe secondary
mitral regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate
pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-12-25**],
mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are more severe and pulmonary
pressures are higher. The other findings are similar.
Findings disscussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 24076**] at 1140 hours on the day of
the study.

C.CATH Study Date of [**2116-2-11**]
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
three
vessel coronary disease. The LMCA had mild disease. The LAD was
totally
occluded proximally with the distal vessel filling via a patent
SVG. The
LCX had a widely patent stent supplying OM2 which filled by a
patent
SVG. The RCA was known to be totally occluded and therefore was
not
selectively engaged.
2. Venous conduit arteriography revealed widely patent SVG-LAD
and
SVG-OM1.
3. Resting hemodynamics revealed an RASP of 11 mm Hg, RVEDP of
18 mm Hg,
PASP of 43 mm Hg, and PCWP of 21 mm Hg. The cardiac output was
4.0 and
the index 2.3.
4. Left ventriculography was deferred.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
3. Patent SVG-LAD, SVG-OM1.

CHEST (PRE-OP PA & LAT)  [**2116-2-12**] 3:14 PM
FINDINGS: In comparison with study of [**2-2**], there is again
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in this patient who has
undergone a previous CABG procedure with intact sternal sutures.
Defibrillator device remains in place. Prominence ill-defined
interstitial markings is consistent with the clinical diagnosis
of vascular congestion.

Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken to cardiac cath and found to have three vessel
disease. He was Iron deficient by labs and given the concern for
GI bleed, though stool guaiac was documented as negative, he was
taken to colonoscopy and EGD, which showed no source of bleed.
His Plavix was held upon admission in anticipation for
cardiothoracic surgery. His Coumadin was discontinued and he was
maintained on heparin drip once GI bleed was ruled out until
surgery. On [**2-17**] he had three teeth extracted.  He was then
taken to the operating room on [**2-20**] where he underwent a mitral
valve repair via right thoracotomy. Please see operative report
for surgical details Following surgery he was transferred to the
CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. He was given
48 hours of vancomycin as he was in the hospital preoperatively.
Later on op day he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. He was restarted on
Coumadin for his atrial fibrillation. Also started on beta
blockers and diuretics and gently diuresed towards his pre-op
weight. He remained in the ICU for pulmonary toilet. Chest tubes
and epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. On [**2-24**],
post-op day four, he underwent right thoracentesis for 250 cc.
He was transferred to the floor on post-op day five. He worke
