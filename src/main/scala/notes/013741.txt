CXR [**2126-4-12**]:
UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Low lung volumes are present.
Cardiac
silhouette is within normal limits. The aorta is slightly
unfolded with
aortic knob calcifications present. The pulmonary vascularity is
normal, as are the hilar contours. Bibasilar patchy opacities
likely reflect
atelectasis, but pneumonia or aspiration is not completely
excluded. There is blunting of the right costophrenic sulcus,
suggestive of a small pleural effusion. No pneumothorax.
Degenerative changes are seen within the left hip as well as
within the lumbosacral spine.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. Low lung volumes. Bibasilar patchy opacities may reflect
atelectasis, but infection or aspiration is not excluded.
2. Probable small right pleural effusion
.
CTA chest [**2126-4-15**]:
CTA CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism to the segmental level. Suboptimal
evaluation of
subsegmental bibasilar pulmonary arteries.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions, dependent atelectasis and
minimal
smooth septal thickening, likely due to mild hydrostatic edema.
3. Bronchial wall thickening, suggesting chronic airway disease.

4. 2-mm left upper lobe ground glass nodule, of indeterminate
clinical
significance.
5. 9-mm right subclavicular lymph node, of uncertain clinical
significance. Left thyroid nodule, could be evaluated by thyroid
ultrasound if clinically relevant.
6. Mild aortic valve calcification, of uncertain hemodynamic
significance.
7. Degenerative changes of the spine, right sternoclavicular
region, and left shoulder.
8. Signs of previous granulomatous exposure.
.
ECHO [**2126-4-15**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is mild aortic valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most
likely represents a fat pad.
IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course:
The patient was admitted to the MICU after aggressive
resuscitation in the ED to include >5L crystalloid, CVL,
vancomycin, cefepime, levofloxacin and pan culture.  Once
arriving in the MICU her vital signs stabilized with resolution
of her significant tachycardia and stabilization of her BP (no
pressors were required).  Her Tmax was 100.7.  As she continued
to improve her antibiotics were narrowed to
vancomycin/levofloxacin.  The patient did develop a diffuse
macular rash on her back and abdomen, improved only by
hydroxyzine but not sarna or denoside cream.  The cause of her
rash was thought to be related to her cefepime, though it was
not clear.  On transfer to the floor, her micro data was
negative with negative C. diff and legionella.  She was
continued on PO vanco for her history of C.diff colitis.
.
Medicine Floor course:
.
# Fever/ Leukocytosis/ Sepsis - Normotensive in MICU and on
floor, afebrile, all cultures negative (BCx from [**2126-4-12**] negative
to date but still pending as of [**2126-4-17**]). Leukocytosis resolved.
Antibiotics scaled back, IV Vanco, Cefepime d/c, patient did
well on PO Levoquin and PO Vanco. Had ID see her inpatient who
recommended 7d course of Levofloxacin 500mg QD with PO Vanco
coverage during that period and for 2 weeks after for CDiff
prophylaxis. CXR and CT showed no focal infiltrate, but patient
with bronchial thickening and productive cough and in setting of
fever and leukocytosis seen on admission, Abx course is
warrented. Of note, Legionella Ag was negative.
.
# Tachycardia - Persistent sinus tachycardia in the MICU and on
the inpatient medicine floor. HR down to 80's, 90's during the
last 2 days of admission. EKG showed sinus tachycardia. Patient
asymptomatic. CTA performed after D-dimer was markedly elevated
which was negative for PE but showed an enlarged supraclavicular
lymph node and a small thyroid nodule.
.
# ARF. Mild renal impairment - volume depletion/hypotension most
likely. Resolved with hydration.
.
# Hypoxia. With concern for pneumonia as above; initially was on
O2 in MICU but during time on inpatient floor patient was
without O2 requirement.
.
# Thyroid nodule. Seen incidentally on CTA - patient w/out SSx
of hyperthyroid except for sinus tachycardia. TSH sent. Pending
at time of D/C, needs to be f/u by PCP.
.
# Code status. Full
.
# Comms with pt's daughter/son
.
# Dispo. Seen and cleared by PT, at home with family following
closely.  Safe for d/c tomorrow [**2126-4-16**] if tachycardia resolved
and pt afebrile.
