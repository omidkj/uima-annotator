Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3556**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Unable to obtain as on ventilator
Obtained history from nursing home records. Called both
HCP/guardians but unable to reach. Patient unable to provide
history as has developmental disabilities with good receptive
language skills but non-verbal due to presence of tracheostomy
placed on [**2111-1-13**].
54F MR, tracheomalacia s/p tracheostomy in [**2107**], PVD, multiple
aspiration pneumonias, DM2 among other conditions who had low
oxygen saturations at her nursing facility. She was noted to
have thick yellow secretions from her trach tube on [**2112-8-9**].
She was started on zithromax. It was noted that today her pulse
ox was low in 70s-80s on supplemental oxygen with no improvement
with suction today. She was tremulous and bluish. She was
transferred to the ER for further care.
Of note, the patient has tracheomalacia. She was hospitalized at
[**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation of severe PVD in Feburary [**2110**] at which
time she went into respiratory distress from pulmonary edema.
Adequate intubation was not possible due to tracheomalacia, and
she underwent open tracheostomy. She stabilized but remained
ventilator dependent for severe week but eventually weaned at
pulmonary rehab. Because of tracheomalacia and subsequent trauma
from tracheostomy (Portex #7), she will likely remain
teacheostomy dependent and not a candidate for decannulation.
Per the IP team, she is not a candidate for a PM valve.
At baseline, she receives continuous humidifcation via trach
mask and large volume nebulizer. The FiO2 settings is from 21-40
% to keep O2 sat > 90 %.
The patient also has a history of bipolar disorder with a long
history of mood swings including agitation, assault, and
depression.
In the ED, initial VS were: Triage 19:51 0 99 112 127/49 18 97%
10 l humidified
Labs were performed
- WBC 19.1 Hgb 10.8 (Baseline [**7-22**]) Plt 175 Diff N 81 L 7.5
- Coags within normal limits

- Lactate 3.4
- UA SpG 1.008 pH 8.5 LE LG Nit neg WBC 12 Bacteria Few Epi < 1

CXR showed limited lung volumes with no acute intrathoracic
process detected although ? pneumonia.
She was given vancomycin, zosyn, and levaquin.
Access was difficult with 20G peripheral IV in shoulder and
failed attempt of right femoral line.
Patient was placed on a ventilator due to continued respiratory
distress and tachycardia. Vent settings were 350x20, PEEP 5,
FIO2 40 %. She was suctioned x 2.
VS on transfer: 00:08 100.3 113 101/64 20 98%
On arrival to the MICU, patient was resting comfortably on the
vent.

Imaging:
[**2112-8-10**]
FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A tracheostomy tube is appropriately
positioned.  Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular
crowding.  The central pulmonary vessels are engorged, however,
no overt edema is seen.  There is no definite consolidation,
pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.

[**2112-8-15**]
Renal U/s
FINDINGS:  The study is markedly limited due to patient body
habitus, edema and portable technique. The right kidney is 8.6
cm and the left kidney is 10.1 cm.  There is no obvious
hydronephrosis. We
