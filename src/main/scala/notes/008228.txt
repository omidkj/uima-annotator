History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 91245**] is a 65-year-old male with a long history of
end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis who originally presented
to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] in [**2166-12-4**] with a cervical spine collapse
into kyphosis who was subsequently treated with a discectomy and
then later a staged anterior and posterior cervical spine
reconstruction. He was discharged from the hospital, but
represented approximately 5 weeks later after having fallen on
the ice and found to have failure of his construct with
migration of his anterior and posterior hardware, as well as
dislodgement of his anterior fibular graft. The structure was
reassessed with imaging and planned to undergo a revision
anterior and posterior cervical spine reconstruction with
deformity correction in a surgical setting.

Pertinent Results:
CT c-spine 2/15/08:1. Since [**2167-3-12**], progression of focal
kyphotic angulation with the apex of the curve at the C4 level
causing at least moderate canal stenosis. New fracture of the C6
spinous process and further distraction of the left C5/6 facet
joint. Further destructive changes of the C3 and C6 vertebral
bodies and the lateral masses of C6.
2. Ventral epidural soft tissue extending from C4/5 to the C6/7
level which may represent hematoma or phlegmon.
3. Anterior displacement of the anterior fixation plate and
screws as well as fracture, angulation, and displacement of the
bone graft. There has been further inferior displacement of the
fixation plate and bone graft since [**2167-3-12**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 91245**] is a 65 y.o. M with ESRD on HD, CAD, CHF, renal
cervical spondyloarthropathy s/p anterior cervical discectomy in
[**12-11**] admitted to the Neurosurgery service with increasing
shoulder pain found to have cervical hardware failure treated
with surgical revision of anterior/posterior cervical fusion
(C3-C6).  His course has been complicated by respiratory
failure, VAP and hypotension requiring several transfers to the
MICU.
.
1. Renal cervical spondyloarthropaty s/p surgical revision of
anterior posterior fusion: He was admitted due to hardware
failure of prior anterior/posterior cervical fusion.  He was
readied for the OR and brought there on [**2167-3-24**] where under
general anesthesia he [**Date Range 1834**] revision anterior and posterior
cervical spine reconstruction with deformity correction, removal
of anterior plate, removal of posterior lateral mass screws,
removal of anterior intervertebral graft, revision corpectomy
C3, C4,C5, C6, revision anterior interbody allograft strut,
arthrodesis anterior C2-C7, interior plate instrumentation
C2-C7, posterior wound culture, posterior revision
arthrodesisC2-T1, hardware removal posterior cervical spine,
revision instrumentation C2-T1, revision posterior arthrodesis
with local autograft, allograft chips and In Fuse bone
morphogenic protein supplementation. He tolerated this well and
remained intubated and was transferred to the ICU for close
monitoring.  He had drains placed intraop - posterior and
anterior - output was monitored. He was moving all 4 extremities
well post-op.  Incisions were CDI. On [**Date Range **]#3 he tolerated
extubation and drains were removed. He was transferred to the
floor, seen in consultation by PT/OT.  On [**Date Range **]# 5 he had
respiratory distress requiring intubation and transfer back to
ICU.  Following intubation a CT of the c-spine was obtained
showing good hardware alignment.  He was treated for pain with
standing tylenol and low dose oxycodone 2.5 - 5mg as needed.  He
was advised to continue wearing the cervical collar at all times
for at least the next three months.  He will be advised by
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 548**] when he can remove the cervical collar.  His posterior
staples were removed during his inpatient stay and he was
scheduled for follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 548**] prior to discharge.
.
2. Respiratory Failure: He was transferred to the MICU on two
separate occasions, the first for hypercarbic respiratory
failure requiring intubation thought due to VAP/aspiration
pneumonia and, obstructive sleep apnea, and hypercarbic from
narcotics. He may have also had a component of edema in soft
tissues surrounding airway from c-spine surgery.  His second
MICU transfer was for difficulty clearing secretions and
macroglossia, he did not require intubation the second time.  He
was treated with vanocmycin and zosyn to complete a 14 day
course of treatment for VAP/aspiration pneumonia.  Since
transfer out of the MICU on [**2167-4-6**] he has been breathing
comfortably o
