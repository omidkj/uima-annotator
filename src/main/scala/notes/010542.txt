treatment of aspiration pneumonia as well as Vancomycin for
possible facility acquired pneumonia.  The patient's sputum
stains demonstrated gram positive cocci in clusters as well
as growth of Providencia stuartii on [**12-11**].  At this time
sensitivities were performed and the patient's antibiotics
were slightly changed to Imipenem for a total of a fourteen

Imipenem with a twenty one day course of Augmentin.  The

ventilatory support with low compliances in the 20s.  Despite
