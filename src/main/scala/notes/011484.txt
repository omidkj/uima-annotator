Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 56625**] was admitted to BIDMCon [**2115-12-11**] and taken to the
operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for an AVR with a 21mm CE
pericardial tissue valve.  She tolerated the procedure well and
was transferred to the ICU in stable condition.  Postoperatively
she remained intubated on mechanical ventilation due to CO2
retention, and was extubated on the evening of POD#2.  She
continued to have elevated CO2 with a normal pH, which was
thought to be her baseline.  She was noted to have a prolonged
PR interval of about .33.  She was transferred from the ICU to
the regular floor on POD#2.  She developed fib on POD#4, was
started on amiodarone on POD#5.  She converted into SR, but
continued to have a very prolonged PR interval.  An EP consult
was obtained and the team was concerned that she was having
heart block with the atrial fibrillation.  She was taken to the
electrophysiology lab for a study on POD#7 where it was
determined that she had some AV nodal disease with a LBBB, but
she was at very low risk for progression to CHB and it was
decided that there was no indication for a permanent pacer.  She
was also cardioverted into sinus rhythm. The EP service
recommended lo dose beta blocker and anticoagulation and no
amiodarone therapy.  She was started on 12.5mg of Lopressor [**Hospital1 **]
and tolerated it well.  Her PR interval remains 2.5-.3.  On the
morning of discharge, she developed periods of slower heart
rates into the 60s.  EP service evaluated her rhythm and
determined that it was due to blocked premature atrial
contractions and recommended continuing her lopressor and
continue with plan for discharge to rehab with a monitored bed.

She has continued to require oxygen thru out her hospital stay,
4L nasal cannula to maintain a Sp O2 of 96%.  Her CXR shows a
large right upper lobe bullae, small bilateral pleural
effusions.  The RUL bullae is consistent with her preoperative
CXR, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] has requested Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 56626**]/Thoracic
surgery to consult regarding management of her bullous disease.

She is being anticoagulated with Coumadin to achieve an INR of
2.0-2.5 for the atrial fibrillation.
