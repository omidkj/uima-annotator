CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  A Cardiac Surgery
consultation was obtained on [**2194-12-25**] by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  After a discussion with the patient's cardiologist
(Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 28032**] [**Name (STitle) **]), and the patient, and her husband it
was felt appropriate to take the patient to the operating
room for removal of the left atrial clot.

The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2194-12-26**] where she underwent removal of a left atrial mass which
was felt to be a thrombotic in nature.  Please see the
Operative Report for a full description of this surgery.
Postoperatively, the patient was transported from the
operating room to the Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit.

The Obstetrics Service and Fetal and Maternal Medicine
Service were consulted.  Fetal heart tones were heard in the
immediate postoperative period with a rate of 130, and they
did fell that the pregnancy was progressing appropriately.

On postoperative day one, the patient remained in good
condition; although, she was having some difficulty with
nausea and pain control.  Her medications were adjusted
according and she was transferred out of the Intensive Care
Unit to the Telemetry floor on [**2194-12-27**].

requiring a little bit of assistance.  The Obstetrics Service
continued to follow the patient.  At 5 p.m. on [**12-27**],
there was another evaluation by the Obstetrics Service and
the patient did have an audible fetal heart tone by Doppler
which was felt to be appropriate.

ambulation.  A Pain Service consultation was obtained because
the patient was still having a lot of difficulty with pain
control.  The patient was started on OxyContin with relief.

remained with good control of her pain.  She has been able to
be up and ambulating independently and was ready to be
discharged from the hospital on postoperative day four.

and oriented.  Her cardiovascular examination revealed a
regular rate and rhythm.  Her wound was clean, dry, and
intact.  Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
