Service:  NEUROMEDICINE
patient was admitted under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], attending
physician; changed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2442**] and then to
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 851**].


right-handed man with myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], who presents with
four to five month history of progressive weakness and
increased shortness of breath.  He notes reduction in his
activity level last summer.  In [**2164-12-29**], he had right
hip surgery and since then he has never recovered to this
late [**Month (only) 956**] or early [**Month (only) 958**], he developed a pneumonia.
Since then he has had progressive weakness and fatigue.  His
worsened in recent months, especially in the past week.  He
has lost about 40 pounds since the hip surgery.  He was seen
in the Movement [**Hospital 2980**] Clinic on [**2165-7-9**].  At this point,
the Mestinon dose had been recently doubled to 180 mg b.i.d.
He was seen again in the clinic yesterday.  He was seen again
in the clinic yesterday, and he complained that he was unable
to walk more than a few steps in his house without becoming
more short of breath than he had previously.  Additionally,
he is having increased problem swallowing.  [**Name2 (NI) **] has been
constipated and requiring manual disimpaction for the past
several weeks.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] began having symptoms of dysphasia approximately 1??????
to two years ago.  He reports that he meant to choose a
primary care physician in the spring of [**2163**].  EMG done in
[**2164-4-29**] done at [**Hospital1 69**]
showed electrophysiologic evidence of single-fiber
examination for a generalized disorder of neuromuscular
transmission, but there were also features of a mild
myopathic process of denervating features and
mild-to-moderate sensory motor polyneuropathy, predominately
axonal in nature.  He also had a positive
acetylcholine-receptor antibody titer of 6.2 nanomoles per
liter.  He was started on Mestinon at that point and
apparently had some improvement in his symptoms.  In the past
three weeks he has also had visual hallucinations awakening
him from sleep.  On one or two occasions, he has also had
hallucinations during the daytime.  He denies headaches.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History is as described above.  The
patient also has hypertension, prostate cancer,
hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep
apnea, and gout.

1.  Mestinon, slow release 180 mg two tabs q.d.
2.  Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d.

5.  Allopurinol 450 mg PO q.d.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient does not smoke or drink.  The
patient is married with step children.  The patient worked in
construction record keeping.  The patient had a distant
alcohol and tobacco use in the [**2103**].  The patient has not
smoked or drank since that time.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Examination revealed the following:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 96.4, pulse 64, blood pressure
116/67, 18 respirations per minute 93% on room air.  Vital
capacity of two liters, negative NIS, negative 44.  GENERAL:
The patient was a pleasant, interactive, well-developed,
well-nourished man in no acute distress.  HEAD:
Normocephalic, atraumatic, sclerae were white.  The patient
had some slight erythema and crusting around the right
lateral eye.  Oropharynx was clear without lesions.  Mucous
membranes were moist.  Neck was supple, no JVD, no bruits.
CARDIAC:  Examination revealed normal S1 and S2, regular rate
with some ectopic beats, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
LUNGS:  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, but
with diminished breath sounds at the bases.  EXTREMITIES:
Without edema, warm, distal pulses intact.  NEUROLOGICAL:
The patient is alert, oriented, cooperative.  He had good
knowledge of recent and past events, but difficulty with
timing of the events.  Months of the year forward and
backwards, serial 7's intact.  Object naming was intact.
Registration intact, 2 out of 3 at 5 minutes.  The patient
follows three-step commands, no apraxia or left-to-right
confusion.  The patient interprets complex visual scene.
Cube and house drawing is adequate and he can write a
sentence.  Speech is fluent and with paraphrasias.  Voice is
soft, nasal, and slightly slurred.  Cranial nerves
examination revealed pupils 3 mm, equal, round, and reactive,
2 mm with disk margins not able to be visualized.  Visual
fields are full to confrontation.  Extraocular muscles are
intact.  There is no nystagmus.  The patient does have
diplopia on up and lateral gaze to the right, but there is no
ptosis.  Face is symmetrical and intact to light touch and
pinprick.  Hearing is intact to light finger rub.  Tongue and
palate are midline.  He is dysarthric with nasal voice.  He
has a weak cough and wet voice after sips of water.  MOTOR:
Examination revealed the following:  Neck flexors are [**5-3**],
and neck extensors [**6-2**].  He has 4/5 strength in the right
deltoid, biceps, triceps, 4+/5 of the left deltoid and
triceps, [**5-3**] in both iliopsoas, [**5-3**] at the right hamstring
and 4+/5 at the left hamstring.  Distal strength is [**6-2**].
There is no pronator drift.  Fifteen repetitions of right arm
shoulder extension strength becomes [**5-3**] at the deltoid.  Deep
tendon reflexes are 2+ of the biceps and triceps, 1+ at the
right brachioradialis, 2+ at the left brachioradialis tendon.
Deep tendon reflexes cannot be elicited of the right lower
extremity.  Plantar response is flexion on the left and
extension on the right.  Bulk was increased in the bilateral
lower extremities.  Sensory examination revealed diminished
light touch, pinprick and temperature and stocking
distribution left to the knee and right to the mid shin.  He
makes errors on joint position sense, left greater than
right.  Vibration is reduced below the hips.  He also has an
anesthetic patch in the left lower femoral cutaneous
distribution that is old.  Coordination is intact with rapid
alternating movements and finger-to-nose testing.
Heel-to-shin is limited by right leg weakness.  Gait testing
was deferred as the patient complained of dyspnea on exertion
throughout the examination.  He did have short-shuffling
steps, no Romberg, and he was unable to tandem.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission labs revealed the following:
Bicarbonate 32, BUN 22, glucose 106, CBC normal, 71%
neutrophils, 28% lymphs, urinalysis normal, coagulations
normal.  Chest x-ray revealed possible right effusion and a
questionable nodule at the left base.

Cardiac perfusion scan of [**2165-5-29**] revealed the following:
Chest CT results currently are all not available.  PFTs from
[**2165-5-29**], results are consistent with moderate restrictive
lung disease in which there was no improvement with
bronchodilators.  There was a moderate reduction in maximal
breathing capacity.  Lung volumes, however, are normal and
gastric change was not impaired.  These results may indicate
the reduced spirometry related to obesity, moderate hypoxemia
with PO2 of 61, pCO2 of 47, indicating mild respiratory
acidosis.

ADDENDUM:  The patient has had three visits to the [**Location (un) 620**]
Emergency Department for dyspnea in the past month.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Neuromedicine
Service on [**2165-7-16**].  He had a swallowing study
performed on the 20th, which revealed aspiration of barium.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was made NPO at that point.  He was started on
Prednisone 10 mg and this was increased to 25 mg on the 20th.
Plan was to gradually increase this dose over the course of
his hospital stay.

The patient was on telemetry and several episodes of
bradycardia and PVCs were noted.

On the [**7-19**], he was transferred to the Medical
Service for the complexity of his medical issues, especially
cardiac.

On [**7-21**], he had a cardiac event of bradycardia and
apnea.  He was bradycardiac to the 20s and hypoxic.  Pulse
and
