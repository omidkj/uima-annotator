Admission Date:  [**2167-5-13**]     Discharge Date:  [**2167-5-25**]

Date of Birth:   [**2106-12-22**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIAC

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Acute intramuscular.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  There is 60-year-old male with
aortic valve replacement in [**2154**] with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] valve,
congestive heart failure, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
who has no prior history of coronary artery disease.  One
week prior to admission, he developed chest pain up to 9/0 in
severity in band-like distribution across his chest.
Initially, he thought it was related to anxiety or
constipation, not relieved by Citrucel.  He denied nausea,
vomiting or diaphoresis.  The chest pain lasted minutes to
hours, usually with exertion, but also while sleeping.  His
last episode of chest pain was just prior to transfer to [**Hospital6 1760**].  He saw his primary care
physician today with chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, and
orthopnea and was sent to [**Hospital3 **] with blood pressure
of 113/67, pulse of 97, 100% on two liters.  He received
aspirin 81 mg times three, Lopressor 2.5 mg intravenous times
two, Lipitor.  Was found to have CK of 1000, troponin of 9.4,
a left bundle branch block that might have been old on
electrocardiogram and was transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for re-vascularization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Aortic valve replacement with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1495**] [**Male First Name (un) 1525**] valve in [**2154**]
for aortic stenosis.
2.  Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 20% in
[**2166-1-21**], likely secondary to valvular disease.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Hypercholesterolemia.
5.  History of appendectomy.
6.  Right ear deafness.
7.  History of Bell's palsy.
8.  History right lower extremity infection.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1. Atenolol 50 mg po q.d.
2. Coumadin 10 mg po q.h.s.

ALLERGIES:  Latex and hydrochlorothiazide.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No coronary artery disease or diabetes in
the family.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He denies any tobacco history, alcohol or
drug use.  He lives by himself, but is close to his sibling.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  He was a well-developed,
well-nourished male, appears diaphoretic and anxious.  Vital
signs:  Temperature 100.5.  Heart rate 119.  Blood pressure
127/89.  Respiratory rate 22.  Oxygen saturation 95% on two
to three liters of oxygen.  Pupils equal, round and reactive
to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx clear.
Neck was supple with no carotid bruits.  Jugular venous
pressure about 8 cm, bilateral crackles [**1-22**] way up, no
wheezing.  Heart was regular with a mechanical S2.  Abdomen
was soft, nontender, nondistended with normal active bowel
sounds.  No edema in his extremities.  No femoral bruits.
All four extremities were cold and clammy.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count of 14.2, hematocrit
of 40.6, platelet count 181,000.  Chemistries:  Sodium 140,
potassium 4.0, chloride 108, bicarbonate 21, BUN 21,
creatinine 1.2, glucose 121, INR 4.9, PTT 57.7, CK 1070, MB
167, troponin of 9.4.  Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm
at 112 with left bundle branch block and first degree heart
block.  No significant change from [**2167-5-12**].  An
echocardiogram from [**2166-1-21**] showed mild left
ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular dilatation,
ejection fraction of 20% with diffuse hypokinesis.  Peak
gradient at aortic valve was 14 with thickened mitral
leaflets.

Patient was given two units of fresh frozen plasma and taken
to cardiac catheterization.  His cardiac catheterization
revealed a left anterior descending artery with 90% proximal
stenosis with mild diffuse disease, 70% occlusion of the left
circumflex at the major obtuse marginal.  He had 80% proximal
occlusion of the right coronary artery with moderate diffuse
disease.  During coronary angiography, patient developed
increasing hypotension and higher degree of atrial
ventricular block.  An intraaortic balloon pump was inserted.
Dopamine was started.  Temporary ventricular pacing was
initiated.  The proximal left anterior descending artery was
stented with good result.  Patient also developed persistent
supraventricular tachycardia which responded briefly to
adenosine and Lopressor.  The patient was discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 70**] of Cardiothoracic Surgery, who felt that the
patient was not a good candidate for emergency bypass
surgery.

The patient was transferred from the Catheterization
Laboratory to the Coronary Care Unit with intraaortic balloon
pump, pacing and low dose dopamine, on aspirin and Plavix.
The CK was found to peak at 3627, subsequently trending down.
The CK-MB peaked at 419.  An echocardiogram of the heart on
admission showed severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
with severely depressed left ventricular systolic function.
The bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis was present, but not
well visualized.  There was no significant obstruction.
Gradient was fully assessed.  Trace aortic regurgitation was
seen and mitral regurgitation was present, but could not be
quantified on the echocardiogram.  A repeat echocardiogram
showed an ejection fraction of less than 20% with anterior
septal, anterior anterolateral and apical akinesis with
hypokinesis elsewhere.  The aortic root was mildly dilated.
The ascending aorta is mildly dilated and the transaortic
gradient was thought to be normal for the prosthesis.  Trace
aortic regurgitation was seen and 1+ mitral regurgitation was
also seen.

The patient was taken back to cardiac catheterization on
[**2167-5-14**].  During cardiac catheterization, patent
proximal stent in the left anterior descending was seen.  The
right coronary artery was dilated and stented with normal
flow post stent.  He was started on heparin after his INR
started decreasing.  He was continued on Plavix and the
patient was weaned off of dopamine and weaned off of the
intraaortic balloon pump.  He was found to be hypoxic
requiring supplemental oxygen.  His chest x-ray showed
pulmonary edema with bilateral small pleural effusion. He was
aggressively diuresed.

Initially, during the hospital course, the patient was
successfully diuresed, but became less responsive to Lasix.
He was started on a nesiritide drip with good effect and
effective diuresis.  The patient was weaned off of oxygen.
His Lasix dose was decreased, however, the patient continued
to have large amounts of urine output.  His creatinine
started increasing.  His acute renal failure was thought to
be prerenal azotemia from over diuresis.  The Lasix was
decreased.  His ACE inhibitor was held for a day and hospital
course was also significant for two runs of 16 beats and 18
beats of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.  He was
evaluated by Electrophysiology Team who recommended an
electrophysiology study, as well as defibrillator.  The
patient preferred and decided to defer the study for two to
three weeks until he re-cooperated from this acute myocardial
infarction.  The patient's creatinine improved with the
decrease in Lasix dose.  He was started on an ACE inhibitor
and restarted on his Coumadin and discharged after his INR
became therapeutic.

He was evaluated by Physical Therapy who recommended some
home services with cardiac rehabilitation and outpatient
exercise program.  The patient was also felt to be anxious
and depressed.  He was started on Celexa at 10 mg po q.d.  By
the end of the hospital course, the patient's acute renal
failure had resolved.  His congestive heart failure was now
compensated.  He was discharged in good condition to home
with services.  He was to have his chemistries, magnesium and
INR drawn in two to three days and to follow-up with his
primary care physician with the results.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Acute myocardial infarction, anterior initial episode.
2.  Congestive heart failure, systolic acute on chronic.
3.  Aortic valve disorder.
4.  Coronary artery disease, native ventricular tachycardia.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient is to follow-up with his primary care
physician before [**2167-5-30**] and to follow-up with his
cardiologist at [**Hospital1 1474**].  He was to follow-up with Dr.
