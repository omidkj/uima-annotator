History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 72M w/ Type 2 DM, ESRD on HD, referred by

EKG:  NSR with mild elevation of ST segments onf V2, V3.
Otherwise unchanged from prior.
.
CXR: Again seen is evidence of CHF and bilateral pleural
effusions. New opacity in the left upper lung, possibly
represents early pneumonia versus asymmetric edema.
.
Chest CT [**10-17**] - Multifocal consolidation and peribronchial
infiltration is present in all lobes.  The largest region of
abnormality is the apical and posterior portions of the left
upper lobe, but smaller abnormalities are present in the
superior
segment of the left lower lobe and at the base of the right
lower lobe is also mild septal thickening throughout the lungs.
The lingula is largely collapsed distal to what appears to be
impacted bronchi.  Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusion
is nonhemorrhagic, layering posteriorly having developed
between [**9-25**] and 15.  There is extensive central lymph node
enlargement ranging up to 20 mm in the right lower paratracheal
and 18 mm in diameter in the pretracheal stations of the
mediastinum with many smaller lymph nodes distributed and there
is no bronchial obstruction by lymph node or compromise
of any other vital structures.  Atherosclerotic calcification in
the aorta and native coronary arteries is severe.  There is no
pericardial effusion.  This examination is not designed for
subdiaphragmatic evaluation except to note the absence of
ascites.
.
CT scan corroborates the well-documented pattern in this patient

of current episodes of pulmonary edema and pleural effusions
also accompanied by mass-like consolidation.  Findings of
extensive central lymph node enlargement are difficult correlate
with those of plain radiographs, but are not necessarily new.
Differential diagnosis of the multifocal pulmonary abnormality
includes current pneumonia, drug reaction, or pulmonary
hemorrhage.
.
Past cardiology studies:
.
[**2108-2-27**] Persantine MIBI: IMPRESSION: 1. Mild-moderate
anterior-lateral and apical reversible defect. 2. Mild global
hypokinesis and septal akinesis. 3. Ejection fraction is 35%.

Cath [**2106-12-22**]:
R dominant system
LMCA: 60% occluded
LAD: widely patent LIMA to LAD. SVG to RI 80% ostial
LCX: patent SVG to OM. LCX 80% prox.
RCA: proximally occluded, filled by collaterals from LIMA/SVG
.
Cath [**2108-3-28**]
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant
circulation demonstrated severe native vessel coronary artery
disease. The LMCA was diffusely diseased with 60% distal
stenosis. The LAD was totally occluded in the proximal segement.
The distal LAD had mild disease and was supplied by the LIMA
graft. The LCx had severe diffuse disease. The OM and Ramus were
totally occluded at their origins, but filled via an SVG.
2. Saphenous vein angiography demonstrated widely patent SVG to
OM and SVG to Ramus. The Ramus was totally occluded after the
touchdown point and filled via collaterals from the grafted OM.

3. Arterial conduit arteriography demonstrated a widely patent
LIMA to LAD.
4. Opening pressure in the central aorta was moderately
elevated.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA to LAD.
3. Patent SVG to OM.
4. Patent SVG to Ramus, but total occlusion after touchdown
point.
.
TTE [**10-17**] -  1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left
atrium is elongated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. There is
asymmetric left  ventricular hypertrophy. There is no asymmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy.  The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic  function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Tissue velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15)
suggesting increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg).
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic  function is normal.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is  seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+)
mitral  regurgitation is seen.
6.There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
7. There is a large pleural effusion present.


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Shortness of breath: Likely due to fluid overload [**1-26**]
paroxysmal a-fib c RVR given prior history of paroxysmal a-fib
with RVR. Unfortunately, pt is not aware when he is in a-fib.
Differential also included fluid overload [**1-26**] ESRD; however pt
did not miss HD session prior to admission. CXR findings with
possible element of PNA, however pt did not have leukocytosis,
fever, and productive cough. Given dose of le
