during which time she was noted to have tracheal stenosis down
to approximately 0.9 cm in diameter from 1.6 cm prox/distal (CT
scans were confirmed by flexible bronchoscopy).
The tracheal stenosis appeared to originate at the level of the
previous tracheostomy, i.e.,
from about the second to fourth tracheal rings. Since [**12-9**], she
has been hospitalized numerous times for respiratory distress.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] was admitted for a tracheal resection and
reconstruction, flexible
bronchoscopy with BAL on [**2115-5-27**] for tracheal stenosis.  3.5 cm
of tracheal stenosis with disrupted cartilaginous ring
inferiorly was noted intraoperatively.  The patient went to the
CSRU postoperatively having been extubated in the OR.  Her pain
was adequately controlled with a morphine PCA , however, she
developed a fever with leukocytosis on the first postoperative
day.  The patient was taken to the OR for a flexible
bronchoscopy with BAL on [**5-29**] for evaluation.  The left lower
lobe was noted to have purulent secretions, which was lavaged
and sent for gram stain and culture.  There were no
endobronchial lesions to the sub-segmental level.  The patient
defervesced with Tylenol and levofloxacin ([**5-29**]), and became
afebrile with a white blood count that was trending down .  On
[**5-30**], the patient's Foley catheter was removed, and she was
transferred to the floor. On [**2115-6-2**], the patient's dose of
prednisone was decreased to 2.5 mg, with no further
complications.

On [**6-3**], microbiology reported her cultures resistant to
levoquin, despite which the patient had defervesced and he white
blood count continued to trend down.  She also went to the OR
for bronchocopy to evaluate the anastamosis; it appeared that
the tracheal anastamosis was well healing, and the patient's
[**Last Name (un) **] was cut.
