Pertinent Results:
[**2141-8-7**] ECHO
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is markedly dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium. The left atrial
appendage emptying velocity is depressed (<0.2m/s). No thrombus
is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The coronary sinus is dilated
(diameter >15mm).
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).

3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending
thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Mild aortic regurgitation is seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral central regurgitation is seen.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine and AV
pacing.
1. LV systolic function is improved.
2. RV function is mildly depressed
3. MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1506**]
4. Aorta is intact post decannulation
5. Other findings are [**Last Name (Titles) 1506**]

[**2141-8-8**] CXR
In comparison with the study of [**8-7**], there has been removal of
the endotracheal and nasogastric tubes. The Swan-Ganz catheter
appears to be pulled back to the right atrium. Enlargement of
the cardiac silhouette persists with minimal fullness of the
pulmonary vessels. Increased opacification is again seen in the
retrocardiac area with a thick band of atelectatic change
adjacent.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2141-8-7**] for surgical
management of his coronary artery disease. He was taken to the
operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting to three vessels and a left atrial appendage ligation.
Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. By postoperative day one, Mr. [**Known lastname **]
had awoken neurologically intact and had been extubated. His
pressors were slowly weaned. Later on postoperative day one, he
was transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. He
was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. His foley was replaced for
urinary retention. His foley was d/c'd and he voided well.  He
was discharged to rehab in stable condition on POD#4.
