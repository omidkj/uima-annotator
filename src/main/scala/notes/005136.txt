CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2166-6-23**]
There are bilateral fluffy perihilar opacities. Lung volumes are
low. There is chronic elevation of the bilateral diaphragms;
however, bilateral pleural effusions are likely present. There
is scoliosis with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 931**] rod in place. Significant
deviation of the trachea is present; however, similar in
appearance to prior examinations.
IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with volume overload.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 80571**] is a 70 year old woman with a history of hypercarbic
respiratory, failure, hypoventilation secondary to kyphosis, and
sleep disordered breathing. She presented to the ICU with SOB
and hypercarbic respiratory failure.

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: She has a history of
hypercarbia, sleep disordered breathing, restriction from
kyphosis. Baseline pCO2 is 85. Upon admisison, pCO2 in 90??????s.
Respiratory failure likely multifactorial- infection/allergy,
diastolic CHF, bronchospasm. She was treated with BiPAP and did
not require intubation. She was started on antibiotics with
Vanc, Zosyn, and Levofloxacin to cover hospital acquired and
atypical pneumonia.  She was also started on methylprednisolone
and then changed to oral steroids with prednisone 60 mg Q day,
and she was on standing nebulizers. Her goal oxygenation is
88-92%. She was also given diuretics with good response. She was
transferred to the Medicine floor on [**6-25**], where she continued
to improve and was at her baseline oxygen requirement of 2L.
Antibiotics were narrowed to levofloxacin, as there was no
radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
.
# Obstructive Sleep Apnea: She was continued on BiPAP. Her
outpatient sleep physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **], made arrangements
for her to receive a new BIPAP SV AUTO machine with increased
supplemental O2. He coordinated this with her homecare company.
He arranged to have [**Hospital 6549**] Medical deliver the machine
to [**Hospital1 **], where it will be in Ms. [**Known lastname 80572**] possession. She
will need to take it home with her.
.
# Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: EF 75%. JVP elevated
on admission with BNP at high of [**Numeric Identifier **]. She was treated with
furosemide IV as noted above, and on the medical floor she was
switched back to her prior dose of 80mg po once daily.
.
# Acute on Chronic renal failure: Baseline 1.1, then 1.6 on
admission, prerenal in etiology. This improved with treatment of
her CHF. Ace-Inhibitor was held in MICU and restarted on the day
of discharge.
.
# Hypertension: Elevated BP first day of admission, later
improved.
.
# Anemia: Chronic normocytic, attributed to chronic disease,
stable.
.
