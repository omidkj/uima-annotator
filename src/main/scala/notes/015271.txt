================
Imaging:
================
CXR [**2128-6-7**]: AP UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: Bibasilar linear
opacities suggestive of atelectasis, however, a developing
infection cannot be excluded. There is no large effusion or
pneumothorax. Heart size is top normal. Tortuosity of the
thoracic aorta with atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic
arch is noted, but the mediastinal silhouette is otherwise
unremarkable. Hilar contours and pulmonary vasculature are
normal. There is a large hiatal hernia. IMPRESSION: Probable
bibasilar atelectasis, although developing infection cannot be
excluded. If there is persistent clinical concern, conventional
PA and lateral radiographs could be obtained for further
evaluation.
