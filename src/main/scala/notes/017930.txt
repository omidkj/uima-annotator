Brief Hospital Course:
86M with PMHx of dilated cardiomyopathy (EF of 20-25%), mitral
regurgitation s/p MVR with bioprosthetic valve, paroxysmal AF,
atrial tachycardia, CAD s/p remote inferior MI who presents with
SOB, dizziness, and bradycardic atrial fibrillation and acute on
chronic systolic heart failure
.
# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION:  Presented with atrial fibrillation with
bradycardia most likely due to accumulation of AV nodal blocking
agents (Metoprolol and Digoxin) in the setting of acute on
chronic renal failure. These medicines were held on admission,
and the pt was then noted to have paroxysmal, narrow complex
atrial tachycardias to the 110's. Beta blockade was restarted,
however these paroxysms continued.  Beta blockade was uptitrated
and pt went for pacemaker placement.  Warfarin was held on
admission and patient was maintained on heparin drip.  Warfarin
was restarted following pacemaker placement.  His INR was 1.7 on
discharge.  He was instructed to have his INR rechecked in two
days in order to further manage his warfarin dosing.

# ACUTE ON CHRONIC SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: TTE from [**2101**] shows
moderate regional LV systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the
inferior wall, apex, and hypokinesis of the anterior wall. LVEF
of 30-35%.  Clinically he was volume overloaded with JVP to
earlobe and pedal edema. The pt was diuresed with IV Lasix which
he responded very well to with dramatic improvement in his
physical exam. The pt was discharged on his original home
regimen of alternating 20 mg and 40 mg of furosemide daily.  His
home regimen of lisinopril was held because of hypotension.
Patient will follow up with his cardiologist regarding when to
restart the ACE inhibitorl.
.
# CORONARIES:  cath from [**2100**] shows no flow limiting coronary
artery disease.  Patient was continued on ASA, metoprolol, and
atorvastatin
.
# CKD - baseline creatinine of 1.8.  Patient was admitted with
creatinine of 2.4,
