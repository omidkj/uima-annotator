Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2485**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia/hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation/extubation/reintubation, trachostomy, HD line
placement, multiple central line placements, PEG tube placement,
intra-abdominal abscess drainage w/ pigtail placement

History of Present Illness:
81 yom CAD, pacemaker, reportedly in USOH until approx 2 weeks
PTA --> non-productive cough, persistent.  No apparent fevers or
myalgias.  Development of malaise, fatigue, generalized weakness
and reduced appetite prompted office visit to usual PCP (G.
[**Doctor Last Name **]) --> noted to be ill-appearing, mild resp. distress,
crackles on lung exam and BP= 68/40.  Transported to [**Hospital1 18**] ER
for further evaluation.



In [**Hospital1 18**] ER, BP= 74/32 --> peripheral dopamine started.  RIght
IJ central line placed (CVP=4) -- attempts at left IJ central
line placement.  Received 5L NS, iv decadron. Anuric renal
failure. Dopamine substituted with Norepinephrine and then added
phenylephrine for persistent hypotension.  Empirically received
Ceftriaxone, Azithromycin and Vanco (reportedly with Levoquin
allergy).  Intubated (traumatic), and transferred to MICU
service for further evaluation and management.



Upon arrival to MICU, intubated, mechanically ventillated,
sedated.  Vasopressin added as third vasopressor with good
effect.  Remains anuric.  Hypothermia (T= 94)

CXR [**2167-3-17**]:
FINDINGS: There are marked dramatic changes from the prior scan
with at least three discrete foci of patchy opacity in the right
mid, right lower, and left lower lungs. There are less apparent
foci noted in the left mid and left upper lung zones as well.
There are changes consistent with prior median sternotomy and
CABG. An indwelling dual-chamber pacemaker is stable in course
and position. Numerous surgical clips are identified in the
right upper quadrant. No definite effusion or pneumothorax is
seen. The visualized osseous structures are otherwise
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Given history, the interval development of patchy
opacities in
the distribution described above are presumably multifocal
pneumonia.
Correlate clinically, and if indicated, continue with close
interval
surveillance.

[**2167-4-8**] UENI:
LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale and color and
pulse wave Doppler examination was performed over the left
internal jugular, subclavian, axillary, brachial, and basilic
veins, demonstrating normal flow, compressibility, respiratory
variation, and augmentation were unremarkable. No evidence of
intraluminal thrombus is seen. The cephalic vein is not seen.
IMPRESSION: No DVT seen in the left upper extremity. The
cephalic vein is
not well visualized, but the basilic vein remains patent.

[**2167-4-15**] CT ABDOMEN:
Fluid collection containing small bubbles of gas as described
above,
situated between the duodenum and pancreatic head and uncinate
process.

Differential considerations include perforation of a duodenal
ulcer or
duodenal diverticulum with resultant abscess. Much less likely,
given the
proximity of the pancreas, a pancreatic process such as an
infected pseudocyst (given the presence of gas) is a
differential consideration. No definite mass is identified.
.
[**2167-4-22**] CT Abdomen w/out IV contrast:
1. The pigtail catheters sits within an air and fluid collection
along the
medial aspect of the second portion of the duodenum in the
region of a
previously visualized duodenal diverticulum. This air and fluid
collection is smaller than on the prior study and currently
measures 5.3 x 2.9 cm.
2. New hypoattenuating lesions are seen in the periphery of the
right lobe of the liver as well as in the spleen. The
differential diagnosis for these findings together includes
infarcts. Additional etiologies that could explain the liver
findings include infectious causes such as cholangitis or
evolving hepatic abscesses. There is no drainable fluid
collection in the liver or spleen at this time.
3. Stable small amount of ascites in the perihepatic and
perisplenic regions which tracks along the right paracolic
gutter into the pelvis.
4. Unchanged large bilateral pleural effusions.
5. Colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
6. Anasarca.
.
[**2167-4-23**] Renal U/S:
No hydronephrosis. Multiple small right renal cysts.
.
[**2167-4-25**] CT Abdomen w/ IV contrast:
1. Residual paraduodenal phlegmon with a pigtail in place.
2. Multiple hypodense areas in the liver and spleen. The liver
findings are again worrisome for small abscesses, although there
is no definite change and no drainable collection. Differential
considerations for the splenic lesions again include abscesses,
infarcts or both.
.
[**2167-4-27**] ECHO:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus/mass is seen in
the body of the left atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %)
with global hypokinesis and regional akinesis of the inferior
wall. There is no ventricular septal defect. with depressed free
wall contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is no
