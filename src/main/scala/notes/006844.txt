Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2836**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute on chronic pancreatitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
* [**2114-8-24**]: you were intubated because of increased respiratory
distress and work of breathing.
* [**2114-8-30**]: you were extubated because you were able to breath
easily on your own.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 59 year old male with a longstanding history of
alcohol abuse and chronic pancreatitis. He was recently admitted
to [**Hospital3 7362**] for alcohol detoxification and to address his
depression and suicidal ideation. He was discharged on [**2114-8-7**]
to a homeless shelter and on [**2114-8-9**] noted the onset of severe
left-sided abdominal pain in the context of chronic epigastric
pain. He presented to [**Hospital 1281**] Hospital ED and was admitted. He
denied nausea, vomiting, fevers at the time. He did report an
episode of diarrhea prior to admission. A CT scan was performed
and identified a 10 cm pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas.
WBC on admission was 11.3, TBili .9, alk phos 78, AST 54, ALT
25, amylase 673, lipase 114.

He was admitted to a medical floor and treated conservatively.
Repeat CT scan on [**2114-8-15**] showed increasing pleural effusions
and ascites and a paracentesis was performed on [**8-16**].  2.7
liters of bloody fluid were aspirated. The fluid studies yielded
amylase 1825, lipase 3515, 30,000 RBC, 2200 WBC, NGTD.

He required ICU transfer on [**8-17**] for increasing shortness of
breath and desaturation to 80% on nasal cannula. While in the
ICU his respiratory status worsened and he required BIPAP, with
ongoing desaturations into the 70's and 80's off of BIPAP. He
was started on levaquin and treated for possible hospital
acquired pneumonia vs. ARDS.

On [**8-18**], surgical consultation was obtained. On evaluation, he
did not complain of significant abdominal pain but did report
difficulty breathing.  At this point his WBC were 18, amylase
194, lipase 29, TBili 1.1, other LFTs normal. His abdominal exam
was reported as benign. On [**8-19**] an ultrasound-guided
percutaneous ascites catheter drainage procedure was performed.
On
ultrasound, they noted a loculated fluid collection surrounding
the spleen, as well as a focal well-circumscribed fluid
collection adjacent to the stomach. A pocket of free flowing
fluid was noted in the right lower quadrant. An 8 French pigtail
drainage catheter was placed into the RLQ with return of dark
amber fluid.

On [**2114-8-23**], the previously yellow colored drainage from the
ascites drain was noted to be notably darker in color and fluid
studies yielded 460 RBC, 400 WBC, amylase 3338, lipase 8030,
culture pending. Surgery was reconsulted for this change in
drain output and a reported increase in abdominal pain and a
worsening
abdominal exam. On evaluation at the OSH he was noted to have
rebound tenderness and guarding and worsening respiratory status
with episodes of hypotension into the 70s. He was making good
urine and remained afebrile without tachycardia. The patient was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] overnight on [**2114-8-24**] for further workup and
management.

On arrival, the patient was noted to be in respiratory distress
on BIPAP. His sats were in the low 90's on 100% FIO2. He stated
that his abdominal pain had been getting worse throughout the
epigastrium and right lower quadrant.

RADIOLOGY:
[**2114-8-24**] ABD CT:
IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive bilateral pulmonary opacities, with patchy
consolidation and
apical predominant interstitial thickening with superimposed
ground-glass
("crazy paving") pattern. Differential includes pulmonary
hemorrhage and
ARDS, while infectious etiology is considered less likely.
2. Pancreatic pseudocyst arising from the pancreatic tail,
extending to
engulf the spleen, which, though enhances normally, is
compressed and
distorted by the resultant mass effect. The splenic vessels are
patent.
3. Moderate free intraperitoneal fluid tracking into the pelvis,
with a right lower q
