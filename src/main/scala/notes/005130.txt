Postoperatively her urine output was low, and she required
multiple boluses.

She was also hypotensive, requiring Dopamine and
Neo-Synephrine support.  The patient was also tried on
Levophed for a short amount of time.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit
postoperatively for blood pressure control and for closer
monitoring.

She slowly improved, however, was requiring blood pressure
support with Neo-Synephrine, as well as Natrecor drips.  She
was given Lasix intermittently for low urine output.

The patient was continued on Dialysis posttransplant just for
support.  The patient slowly improved and was able to be
successfully extubated.  Her urine output slowly improved,
and she was able to be weaned off of her pressor support.

Her Lasix was stopped, and she was placed on Lasix b.i.d. for
diuresis.  She was continued on Bactrim and
.................. for prophylaxis.

Her JP drain, which was placed intraoperatively, was removed.
The patient slowly did well, and her pressors were stopped.

time.  She was continued on her FK, Prednisone and MMF and
slowly stabilized.

She was ultimately started on Avandia, as well as a Humalog
Insulin sliding scale.

Physical Therapy was consulted for ambulation, as well as
assessment of function.  She continued to improve; however,
at the time of discharge, she was unable to do stairs.  It
was decided with the patient's wishes to go home with

6.0 preoperatively.  Her Foley was removed on [**2193-11-28**], but she was unable to void, and the Foley was replaced.

decided that the patient could be discharged home.
