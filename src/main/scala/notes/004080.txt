Chief Complaint:
Weakness and falls

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 86 year old male with multiple medical issues
including previously treated follicular lymphoma, diastolic CHF,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, COPD no longer on home O2, and
CKD who was admitted to OSH on [**2117-6-6**] with weakness and falls
at home.
.
On that admission, he was found to be in atrial fibrillation
with labs notable for CK 500-600s, Calcium 12.5, PTH not
elevated, Creatinine 1.4, and HCT 27 (baseline in mid 30s). His
head CT head showed no acute process. He was given 1500 ml IV
fluids with improvement in his calcium to 10.7. He converted to
sinus rhythm at 70 bpm with vital signs stable. He was recently
being evaluated here for possible Nissen fundoplication, and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management of his anemia and
hypercalcemia.
.
On reaching the floor, he reported some recent dyspnea on
exertion and dizziness when standing. He denied any other acute
complaints. He notes that his activiy level has been declining,
and he no longer likes to walk around his home due to fatigue
and dyspnea. he uses a walker when he does ambulate. He was
previously on home oxygen for COPD, but no longer uses it. He
lives alone with support from his neighbors for shopping.
.

CHEST (PA & LAT)	Study Date of [**2117-6-9**] 9:14 PM
As compared to the previous radiograph from [**2117-6-6**], there
is no relevant
change.  The known left apical mass is obliterated by the soft
tissues of the
neck.  Unchanged evidence of moderate cardiomegaly with moderate
pulmonary
edema and signs of interstitial fluid overload.  Presence of a
small left
pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  No newly appeared
parenchymal opacities.
.
CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST	Study Date of [**2117-6-10**]
1.  Left apical mass, substantially progressed since [**2117-3-21**] and chest radiograph from [**2117-1-17**], progressing into
the neck with multiple pulmonary metastases and liver
hypodensities, highly concerning for metastatic disease.
Findings are most likely representing Pancoast tumor, primary
lung malignancy.  Lymphoma will be substantially less likely.

2.  Unusual appearance of the left kidney, partially imaged with
this
technique which is not tailored for evaluation of renal disease.
 If
clinically warranted, correlation with ultrasound or dedicated
CT or MR might be considered.  Correlation with urine cytology
might also be beneficial.


Brief Hospital Course:
PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION:
====================================
Mr. [**Known lastname 88299**] is an 86 year old male with multiple medical issues
including previously treated follicular lymphoma, paraesophageal
hernia, diastolic CHF, afib, COPD who was admitted to OSH on
[**2117-6-6**] with weakness and falls, during workup at [**Hospital1 18**] found to
have new diagnosis of metastatic cancer likely from the lung.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
==================
# L upper lung malignancy (Pancoast tumor):
Discovered on work-up of hypercalcemia with CT scan on [**6-13**].
Oncology consult thought likely primary lung cancer that has
metastasized to liver and R lung, less likely lymphoma. Oncology
gave a 6-month prognosis and recommended that pt would not be a
good candidate for treatment as he is too weak, did not tolerate
chemotherapy in the past, and biopsy would not be helpful as
treatment would not change despite the type of cancer.
Palliative care was consulted and contributed to his care.

# Goals of care:
Patient was made DNR/DNI during his stay. Multiple family
meetings were held throughout the admission with patient's son
