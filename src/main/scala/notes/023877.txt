Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**]
Chief Complaint:
Refractory Hypertension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy with biopsy


History of Present Illness:
This is a 73 year-old female with a history of hypertension,
coronary artery disease, migraine headaches, who was transferred
from [**Hospital3 10377**] hospital for neurosurgical
evaluation after a right parietal intracranial hemorrhage was
noted on CT scan performed for evaluation of headache. Patient
presented initially due to persistent headache for 3 weeks. She
denied any focal weakness, gait instability, visual disturbance,
dysarthria, nausea, vomitting, or any other symptoms. She
initially felt the headache was secondary to migraine and took
Fioricet with minimal relief. Eventually, she let her primary
care physician know, and he referred her to the emergency room.
At [**Hospital3 417**] ED, right parietal hemorrhage was noted and
patient was referred for neurosurgical evaluation. She was also
treated with labetalol 5mg IV x 4. At [**Hospital1 18**], Preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**]
of repeat head CT demonstrated right parietal calcifications,
with no cerebral oedema, mass effect, or midline shift. Patient
continued to have marked hypertension (190/50) in the emergency
room and was started on labetalol continuous infusion. She was
admitted to MICU for further management of refractory
hypertension. She reports she has been adherent to all her
anti-hypertensive medications.
.
In the ED, initial blood pressure was 205/85. She received total
labetalol IV total of 20mg, then started on continuous infusion.
She was also given potassium chloride 50mEq for hypokalemia and
was admitted for further management. Neurosurgery was consulted
and recommended conservative management, blood pressure control,
and no need for seizure prophylaxis.
.
On review of systems, patient denies any fevers, chills, chest
discomfort, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
conspipation, lower exremity oedema, dysuria, or rashes.

Pertinent Results:
Admission Laboratories [**8-17**]: Notable for potassium of 2.5 and
creatinine of 1.5. ECG: Sinus rhythm at 70 bpm, normal axis,
normal PR, QRS intervals. QT is 452mm intervals, normal R-wave
progress, LVH, no ST or T-wave changes, Q-waves in inferior
leads.

Imaging:
Head CT [**8-17**]:
IMPRESSION: Three rounded foci, 1-2 mm in size within the right

frontoparietal region and a second focus in the left temporal
lobe most likely represent calcium, possibly sequelae from prior
infection or inflammation. These calcifications could also be
associated with an underlying vascular abnormality. If
clinically indicated, an MRI could be performed to further
characterize this finding.
Air-fluid level within the left maxillary sinus may represent
acute sinusitis. Clinical correlation recommended.
_____
[**2134-8-18**]   Radiology MRA CHEST W&W/O CONTRAS
IMPRESSION:
1. Right lung mass with subcarinal and right paratracheal
lymphadenopathy,
highly suspicious for metastatic lung cancer. Dedicated
evaluation with chest CT is recommended.
2. Severe narrowing of the origin and 3.5 cm distal to the
origin of the left subclavian artery. A small filling defect at
the origin of the left
subclavian may represent thrombus superimposed on athersclerotic
plaque.
3. Moderate-to-severe stenosis of the left common carotid
origin.
4. Probable aortic stenosis and regurgitation. Further
evaluation with
echocardiography is recommended.
5. Atrophic left kidney.
6. Small vertebral lesion, which may represent a hemangioma but
not fully
characterized on this exam.

[**2134-8-19**] ECHO: normal biventricular systolic function

IMPRESSION:
1. Large heterogeneous mass in the right upper and middle lobes
with
associated hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, highly
concerning for
bronchogenic carcinoma. No pleural effusion or chest wall
invasion.
2. Additional pulmonary nodules in the right middle and lower
lobes,
measuring up to 8 mm each.
3. Small segmental pulmonary embolus within the anterior segment
of the right lower lobe pulmonary artery.
4. Extensive atherosclerotic disease within the aorta and
moderate
calcification in the LAD.
5. Moderately severe centrilobular emphysema.
6. Left adrenal hyperplasia without focal nodule.

IMPRESSION:
Bilateral high-grade stenoses of the proximal renal arteries,
left greater
than right, with bilateral renal atrophy, also left greater than
right. The function of the left kidney is likely quite imparied
and could be quantified with nuclear medicine, if needed.
_____
FNA, right paratracheal lymph node:
Positive for malignant cells, consistent with metastatic
adenocarcinoma.

Brief Hospital Course:
She is a 73 year-old female with a history of hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease and previous stroke who
presents with 3 week course of headache and intracranial
densities concerning for ICH vs. previous insult.

1. NON SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER -patient originally transferred
for evalutation of hypertensive urgency, headache, and
?intracranail bleed. Due to marked blood pressure differential,
MRI/A was obtained to rule out dissection, which ultimately
diagnosed a RML lung mass. Patient underwent bronchoscopy with
biopsy confirming adenocarcinoma. Oncology was consulted. MRI
head was obtained for staging purposes and to follow up
?calcifications noted on head ct, now with new diagnosis of lung
cancer. MRI showed possible leptomeningeal metastases.
Outpatient follow up in Thoracic [**Hospital **] clinic was arranged,
and she will be called with an appointment time. She was seen by
the palliative care service while she was inpatient to address
goals of care. She was DNR/DNI throughout her stay. She will not
need a PET/CT given her brain metastases, and presumed Stage IV
diagnosis.

2. RENAL ARTERY STENOSIS -Patient initially admitted with
difficult to control blood pressure and evidence of atrophic
kidney. MRI abdomen confirmed high grade renal artery stenosis,
Left greater than Right. Her blood pressure was eventually
controlled on 3 agents, however, due to impending nephrotoxic
chemotherapy agents, and plan for long term anticoagulation,
consideration was given to intervention on arterial stenosis
this admit, while she was on a heparin drip. Cardiology was
consulted and evaluation and intervention was recommended, on
both her stenosed/occluded subclavian arteries and bilateral
renal arteries, to 1. provide better information of her true
central pressures, since hypertensive urge
