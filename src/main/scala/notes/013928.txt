Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
A-line

History of Present Illness:
74 y/o M with multiple medical problems including hx of
[**Name (NI) 94612**], CVAs, CAD, afib on coumadin and chronic aspriation
presents from rehab with fevers and lethargy from nursing home.
He has dementia and cognitive deficits at baseline from his
CVAs. He was hypoxic to 48% on RA at the nursing home. He
arrived and was on NRB and had O2 sats in high 90s and was very
tachypneic. He was complaining of SOB but no other history could
be obtained.

In the ED, initial vs were T 99.9, P 100, BP 91/52, R 32 O2 sat
100% on 15 NRB. He had difficult access. The ED team tried R fem
and accessed the artery twice, then R IJ. They were able to
place a CVL in the L groin. His oxygentation worsened and he was
intubated. His code status could not be confirmed.
In the ED labs show elevated trop to 1.63; ekg with lateral ST
depressions, so cardiology was consulted. They thought it was
likely demand ischemia in the setting of sepsis and did not
recommend starting heparin. He also had a hct of 21 down from
baseline around 30 and was transfused two units of PRBCs. His
SBP dropped to the 80s after intubation and a levofed gtt was
started. He also received 1 gm vanco, 4.5 gm zosyn, and an [**Name (NI) **]
600 mg PR. He was trace guiac positive on rectal exam.

On the floor, the patient is intubated and sedated. No history
could be obtained. ROS was negative except for that in HPI per
report.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or
gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing.
Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, or weakness.

The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the mid- and
distal septum, as well as apex (mid-LAD distribution). The
remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 40-45%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Mild mitral regurgitation.

RUE U/S: NO DVT


Brief Hospital Course:
74 y/o M with multiple medical problems including hx of
[**Name (NI) 94612**], CVAs, CAD, afib on coumadin and chronic aspriation
presented on [**3-10**] with pneumonia. He was found to be hypoxic to
48% RA at his nursing home.  He was intubated and femoral line
placed in the ED due to respiratory distress, at that time code
status could not be confirmed.  He had an NSTEMI with troponin
peak at 1.8 (thought to be due to demand).  He was intubated and
required pressors briefly in the setting of intubation.  He was
extubated on [**3-11**] with no pressor requirement.  He was also
noted to have a drop in his Hct for unclear reasons and was
transfused 4 units of blood while in the ICU.  He was
transferred to the floor where antibiotics were changed to
Vanco, Cefepime, and Flagyl (to cover for aspiration as patient
was still febrile on HAP coverage).  Patient had much difficulty
with his own secretions. On [**3-17**], he developed rapid breathing,
gurgling, secretions. Sats dropped to the 70s on 3L NS. Started
on an NRB. Found to have SBP in the 190s.  He was again
tranferred to the ICU, was febrile to 100.6, tachypneic,
diaphoretic.
