History of Present Illness:
53 yo m with no significant PMhx, presents from [**Hospital3 7569**]
with a STEMI. Pt states that he was working this morning at the
post office doing cleaning when he devloped chest pain at 8:40.
The pain was substernal, severe, non-radiating. No prior chest
pain hx. Was associated with nasea and emesis x 2, non-bloody.
Also had palpitations. He denied shortness of breath or
diaphoresis.

Pt called 911 at 9AM and was taken to the [**Location (un) **] ER. , VS at
that ER were [**Age over 90 **]F, HR 90, BP 152/56, RR 18, 98%RA , He received
ASA 324mg, plavix 300mg, nitro gtt, lopressor 5mg x 1 IV,
lovenox 75mg, and tirofibran. Pain improved to [**1-12**] with
fentanyl (total 450mcg), but did not resolve. He was dx with a
STEMI and was transferd to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac cath.

He continued to have chest pain on arrival to the ER here, and
was given nitro gtt and dialudid 0.5mg x2 without relief. In the
ED, initial vitals were 60, 162/90, 100% on 4L NC. He was to
cardiac cath and was found to have a full occulsion of the
proximal LAD and 80% focal mid RCA stenosis. LCx had mild
luminal irregularitits. He had a thrombectomy of the LAD lesion,
then had 2 Xience stents placed- 2.5 x 15 and 3 x 28. He was
started on gentle IVF and given lasix 10mg IV x 1. He was also
found to have an EDLV pressure of 38. His chest pain resolved
after the procedure. He was continued on the tirofibran post-op.


On review of systems, he denies any prior health issues.
Including myalgias, cough, urinary problems, recent illness,
fever, constipation/diarrhea, black stools or red stools. He

cath report


Brief Hospital Course:
53 yo m with no significant past medical history, transfered
from an outside hospital with a ST elevation myocardial
infaraction.   OSH with STEMI, now s/p PCI with thrombectomy and
[**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] 2 to prox LAD with resolution of chest pain.
.
# ST-elevation myocardial infarction:   EKGs on admission were
consistent with anterolateral and sepatal infarct. He received
ASA, plavix, beta blocker, and tirofiban.  Patient was taken to
catheterization and found to have total occlusion of proximal
LAD.   He underwent thrombectomy with placement of 2
drug-eluting stents to the proximal LAD and was subsequently
free of chest pain. CK peaked at 5962 on [**12-21**].  EKG showed
improvment in lateral leads after the intervention.  Tirofiban
was continued for 18 hours post-cath.  He remained chest pain
free. He returned to the cath lab the following day for
placement of a third stent in the RCA.  He will need to continue
Plavix and aspirin for 1 year as well as high dose statin, beta
blocker, and ACE inhibitor as below.  Lipid panel done for risk
stratification and showed LDL 186. Nuclear stress test 72 hours
after the STEMI showed a large fixed defect as seen on the echo
(as below) without symptoms.  PCP and cardiology [**Name9 (PRE) 702**] was
arranged.
.
# PUMP: TTE done for risk stratification showed EF 30-35% and
apical akinesis.  Anticoagulation was thus undertaken with
therapeutic lovenox briding to warfarin.  Warfarin 5 mg was
started on [**2105-12-23**].  He should be therapeutically anticoagulated
for at least 3-6 months pending repeat echo. He will be followed
by [**Company 191**] anticoagulation nurses. ACE inhibitor and beta blocker
were also started.
.
# RHYTHM: He remained in sinus rhythm.
.
# Hyperlipidemia:  High-dose statin was started for STEMI.
.
# Elevated LFTs- On admission, ALT 84, AST 445, LDH 912.  His
baseline was unknown and he denied EtOH abuse.
.
# Hypophosphotemia- Initial phos level of 0.8, rechecked at 2.8.
 This was likley lab error.

Discharge Condition:
Hemodynamically stable, afebrile


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] due to chest pain. You had a heart
attack. You had a cardiac catheterization to open up your blood
vessel by removing a clot. You had 2 stents placed in your LAD
blood vessel. You had a second cardiac catheterization to open
up your RCA blood vessel and had one stent placed in the middle
of the vessel.

Due to your heart attack, your heart is not contracting as
strong. This puts you at risk for clots forming in your heart
that could cause a stroke. Therefore, while your heart recovers,
you will need to be on blood thinning medications. You were
started on lovenox shots, which you will need to take until your
coumadin blood levels are high enough. The coumadin are pills to
thin your blood, they require frequent lab work to monitor there
levels called an INR. You will have this followed by the [**Company 191**]
anticoagulation nurses. They will call you to arrange this.

You were started on new medications. Please take your
medications as instructed. It is very important to take your
plavix (copidogrel) and aspirin everyday for at least a year to
prevent closure of your heart stents.

Please keep your follow up appointments.  Please call to arrange
cardiac rehabilitation at the numbers given t
