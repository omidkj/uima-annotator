History of Present Illness:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **]yo caucasian female with multiple ER visits for
GI discomfort, was noted to have murmer, echo revealed severe
AS. She admits to frequent episodes of dizziness, sometimes at
rest. She is only able to tolerate [**1-2**] steps without stopping
due to shortness of breath. She reports extreme worsening
fatigue, and inability to do any ADLs without frequently
stopping due to shortness of breath and fatigue. She is unable
to bend forward to
reach something low due to dizziness and lightheadedness. She
denies chest pain. She denies any prior history of MI,CVA, or
diabetes. She admits to myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**] though has not seen
her neurologist due to her discontinuation of her meds related
to GI upset. She is being referred for aortic valve treatment
options.

Pertinent Results:
[**2156-2-9**] Prevalve implant

No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There are simple
atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple atheroma in
the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve
stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate ([**12-1**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-1**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion. Drs [**Last Name (STitle) 914**], [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **]
were notified in person of the results on [**2156-2-10**]

Post valve implant

Core seen in the aortic position. It appears well seated. There
are two small perivalvular leaks seen. Mild mitral regurgitation
present. Rest of the examination is unchanged.

[**2-17**] Echo:
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF 65%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall
function. An aortic CoreValve prosthesis is present. The
transaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. A mild
paravalvular aortic valve leak is present. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2156-2-12**], the left ventricle is no longer hyperdynamic;
the tricuspid regurgitation is reduced


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 92297**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2156-2-9**] for managment of
her aortic valve disease. She underwent a preoperative work-up.
The neurology service evaluated her in preparation for surgery
and found her to be neurologically competent. On [**2156-2-10**], She
was taken to the operating room where she underwent a
percutaneous replacement of her aortic valve. Please see
operative note for details. Postoperatively she was taken to the
intensive care unit for monitoring. She was later extubated
without issues. She required fluid for resuscitation. On
postoperative day two she was transferred to the step down unit
for further recovery.
She developed atrial fibrillation post-operatively with rates
into the 140s.  Beta blocker was adjusted and rate control
achieved.  EP evaluated the patient and recommended rate control
with beta blocker, without amiodarone.  Additionally, it was
decided by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] not anti-coagulate the patient taking into
consideration her age and that she is already on Plavix and
Aspirin.  Enalapril was titrated for blood pressure control.
Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without
complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy
service for assistance with strength and mobility.
By the time of discharge on POD 9 the patient was ambulating,
yet deconditioned, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to [**Doctor First Name 391**] [**Hospital **]
Rehab in good condition with appropriate follow up instructions.
