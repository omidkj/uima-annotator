Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
bradycardia
.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
TTE
PICC line placement

History of Present Illness:
59 F w/ recent L MCA CVA and resulting hemiplegia/aphasia
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] w/ bradycardia to 30s.
.
Recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] [**2154-12-20**] to [**2155-2-14**] for large
left-sided MCA stroke w/ severe hemiplegia/aphasia. Discharged
to [**Hospital **] rehab on [**2-14**]. Admitted to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital
[**Date range (1) 106409**], where BCxs showed enterococci, started on linezolid
given hx of VRE. She also received metronidazole for presumed c
diff. diarrhea.
.
At admission, [**2155-3-6**] Pt was noted to be in a junctional brady
rhythm at 35 bpm, no clear p waves, rbbb (new), diffuse twf, twi
in v1-5, Q III (old). Cr=2.2 from baseline Cr=0.8, K=5.2,
lactate=3.3, u/a with > 50 wbcs, many bact, neg nitrite. Pt
received vancomycin 1 gram IV X1, kayexalate 30 mg, asa 325
mgX1. Cards consulted and recommended no intervention. Patient
was transferred to MICU.
.
Pt's bradycardia resolved with electrolyte balancing and IVFs.
Ampicillin was added for amp-sensitive enterococcus coverage.
TTE did not indicate endocarditis. Ciprofloxacin was added for
U/A consistent w/ UTI. Metronidazole was discontinued, as C.
Diff negative x2. Hydralazine was used for BP control, as A-V
nodal blockers were avoided given bradycardia.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2155-3-6**] 6:25 PM
FINDINGS: There is no hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of the
normally midline structures. There is age-appropriate
involutional change. There are periventricular and subcortical
white matter hyperdensity, not significantly changed consistent
with chronic microvascular ischemia. A chronic lacunar infarct
is seen within the left basal ganglia. There are unchanged
thickened septations within the right maxillary sinus with
decreased mucosal thickening likely secondary to chronic
sinusitis and less likely odontogenic in origin.
IMPRESSION:
1. No hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. No significant change from prior examination.
3. The cortical and deep infarction within the left MCA
distribution, demonstrated on the previous MRI is not
well-visualized.
MRI with DWI is more sensitive in the detection of acute
infarction.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2155-3-6**] 4:54 PM
AP UPRIGHT CHEST: Since the prior study, there has been removal
of the right- sided PICC, and clearing of left lower lobe
retrocardiac opacity. No new regions of consolidation are seen.
Lung volumes remain low. The cardiac and mediastinal contours
are stable. There is no pulmonary vascular engorgement at this
time. Again seen are calcifications in the left and mid upper
abdomen consistent with pancreatic calcifications. Tubing from a
GJ catheter overlies the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. The
osseous structures do not demonstrate any displaced fractures.
IMPRESSION: No acute pulmonary process. Improved aeration of the
left lower lobe since the prior study.
.
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent  with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-31**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired
relaxation. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There
is a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2155-1-3**], the

anteroseptal/apical/anterior wall motion abnormality appears
resolved
(although apex is not fully visualized).

Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo F with h/o recent L MCA CVA and resulting in severe
impairment presenting  after being found to be bradycardic to
the 30s at her rehab.
.
Bradycardia: Recently hospitalized at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital with
bradycardia and hypotension to 70s/40s. Pt was noted on
admission to be in a junctional bradycardic rhythm at 35 bpm, no
clear p waves, RBBB (new), diffuse TWF with TWI in v1-5, Q III
(old).  The patient had relative hypotension on admission that
may have been secondary to bradycardia or sepsis as patient was
found to have Enterococcus bacteremia.  Cardiology was consulted
and suspected  bradycardia might be secondary to metabolic
derangements in setting of acute illness versus beta-blocker
toxicity with ARF.  The patient ruled out myocardial infarction
with 3 sets of negative cardiac enzymes. Her nodal agents were
held and she returned to [**Location 213**] sinus rhythm at 70 bpm.  After a
few days, her beta blocker and calcium channel blocker were
restarted and she tolerated this for two days.  However, she
again was noted to have a junctional rhythm in the 30s and was
transferred to the CCU for temporary screw-in wire pacemaker
[**2155-3-13**].  After this temporary pacer was placed, the patient
spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm.  TTE was negative for
abscess or endocarditis, but there remained concern and a TEE
was attempted.  The first attempt was unsuccessful secondary to
patient agitation.  A subsequent attempt at TEE with the patient
intubated/paralyzed by anesthesia was also unsuccessful due to
inability to pass the probe past the oropharynx due to anatomy.
EP followed the patient during admission.  All nodal agents were
discontinued per their recommendations.  The patient's pacemaker
rate was decreased to 45 and the patient subsequently had no
pacemaker spikes on telemetry. Temporary pacemaker was removed.
The patient is to be monitored on telemetry when discharged to a
rehabilitation facility.

Renal failure: On recent discharge the patient's creatinine was
0.8, and the patient was noted to have ac
