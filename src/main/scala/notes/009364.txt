with a history of hypercholesterolemia who was transferred
from an outside hospital to [**Hospital6 2018**] on [**2168-5-20**] for coronary artery bypass graft.
The patient described acute onset of chest pain, beginning
[**2168-5-17**] which awoke her from sleep.  The patient
described the pain as crushing and substernal with radiation
to the jaw and associated shortness of breath and
diaphoresis.  The patient reports that the pain subsided
spontaneously but recurred the following two mornings.  Each
episode lasted approximately 1.5 hours.  The patient
subsequently referred herself to an outside hospital at which
initial evaluation demonstrated an elevated creatinine kinase
to 315, an MB of 25.3 and troponin of 0.3.  Electrocardiogram
demonstrated ST depression in leads V2 and V3 with diffuse ST
flattening.  Cardiac catheterization conducted at an outside
hospital demonstrated three vessel disease with 95 to 98% mid
left anterior descending stenosis, 95% left circumflex
stenosis and 80% right coronary artery stenosis.  The
patient's ejection fraction was noted to be at 50% with
inferior basilar hypokinesis.  The patient was subsequently
transferred to [**Hospital6 256**] for
medical and surgical management.

the procedure well with successful bypasses from the left
internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal and saphenous vein
graft to the posterior descending.  The patient's pericardium
was left open; lines placed included an arterial line,
Swan-Ganz catheter, and central venous pressure/right
arterial catheter; both ventricular and atrial wires were
placed; mediastinal and left pleural tubes were placed
intraoperatively.  The patient was subsequently transferred
to the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit, intubated, on
Amiodarone and Propofol drips for further evaluation and
management.  Shortly following arrival in the Cardiac Surgery
Recovery Unit, the patient was successfully reversed and

patient's postoperative course was uneventful and she
progressed well clinically.  On postoperative day #2, her
chest tube and Foley catheters were removed without
complication.  Follow up chest x-ray demonstrated no evidence
of pneumothorax and the patient was noted to be independently
productive of adequate amounts of urine for the duration of
her stay.  The patient underwent evaluation by physical
therapy who subsequently deemed her fit to be discharged to
