Cxray: [**2129-4-9**]: Findings consistent with CHF and bibasilar
consolidations.
.
EKG: old LBBB
.
TTE [**2129-4-14**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 60%). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is
mildly dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is a globulat thickening at the base of the
posterior mitral leaflet; this most likely represents mitral
annular calcification, but a mass
or vegetation on the mitral valve cannot be excluded. Mild to
moderate ([**2-6**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.



Brief Hospital Course:
83 year old female with anoxic brain injury s/p VT arrest in
[**10/2128**], chronically vent / trach / PEG, with history of CHF, DM
presented with acute hypoxia and sepsis.
.
# Respiratory Failure:  The patient was empirically started on
vancomycin and zosyn given her history of MRSA, VRE, and
pseudomonas infections.  She completed a 7 day course of these
in addition to a 4 day course of flagyl, and then she was
switched to meropenem on [**2129-4-12**] when her sputum grew out
pseudomonas (meropenem sensitive), proteus, and an unidentified
gram neagive rod. On [**2129-4-11**] she had a right thoracentesis which
showed exudative fluid.  Plan to continue meropenem for 6 weeks
(see below).  She was also started on a steroid taper while in
the hospital due to her respiratory distress.
.
# ?Endocarditis -  The patient had a TTE which showed a
questionable vegetation on the mitral valve.  When the daughter
was asked to consent for a TEE she refused, and so the decision
to empirically treat the patient for endocarditis was made.  The
patient did not have a murmur while in hospital and did not have
any positive blood cultures.  Plan to treat with meropenem for 6
weeks.
.
# Renal failure:  Patient was admitted with a creatinine of 1.2
which rose to 2.7 by hospital day 7.  She also developed low
urine output which did not respond well to either IVFs or lasix.
 The renal service was consulted and felt that the acute renal
failure was likely multifactorial ATN due to sepsis,
hypotension, CHF, and IV contrast dye.  They recommended not
diuresing her and to minimize fluid intake, in the hope that her
renal function would improve over time.  Epogen was started on
[**2129-4-15**].
.
# Hypotension:  The patient initially required levophed but
weaned off rapidly.  During most of her hospitalization she had
high CVPs, positive ins/outs, appeared hypervolemic, and was
normotensive (but with low urine output).  An echo on [**2129-4-14**]
showed an EF of 65%, and ? vegetation on MV. Her initial
hypotension was presumed to be caused by sepsis.
.
# Anemia: Chronic anemia but now with an acute decrease.
Possibly a slow GI bleed as she has had guaiac positive stools
during this hospitalization.  She received 1 unit of pRBC on
[**2129-4-12**] and another unit on [**2129-4-15**].  Her hct did not remain
stable while in the hospital.
.
# Endo: The patient has a history of diabetes and
hypothyroidism.  While in hospital she was maintained on NPH,
regular insulin sliding scalem and levothyroxine.

**The hospital course was explained to the daughter (health care
proxy) by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 60329**] on [**2129-4-15**] and by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**2129-4-18**].  Daughter feels comfortable assuming the risk and
sending the patient back to [**Hospital3 672**] rehab.
