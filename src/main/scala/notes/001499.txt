   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2107-4-30**] 10:37 PM

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST

Reason: SPONTANEOUS RT FRONTAL BLEED

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
61 year old woman with spontaneous right frontopariteal
hemorrhage.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
increased bleed?
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Spontaneous right frontoparietal hemorrhage,
evaluate for increased bleed.

COMPARISON: No prior studies available for comparison.

TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT scan.

FINDINGS: There is a large area of hyperdensity consistent with
acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage involving the right frontal
lobe, measuring approximately 6.4 x 5.3 cm in axial dimensions.
Low density area is seen surrounding the hemorrhage, consistent
with edema. There is mass effect on the right lateral ventricle
with leftward shift of approximately 5 mm. Suprasellar cistern
and temporal horns appear preserved. Mucosal thickening in the
right maxillary sinus is incompletely evaluated.

IMPRESSION: Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage seen involving the
right frontal lobe, with surrounding edema. Underlying lesion
cannot be excluded, and further evaluation with MRI could be
helpful. Leftward shift of approximately 5 mm.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
61 F admitted to the Trauma ICU found to have a RIGHT MCA
ANEURYSM her BP was kept strictly less than 140, Q1 Neurochecks
implemented and she was brought the the angio suite and had a
formal angiogram and the the aneursym was not able to be coiled.
She brought to the OR and underwent a right sided cranitomy with
coiling of aneurysm. Post operatively she was plegic on the left
side same as pre-op. Post operatively she would follow commands
on the right. On POD#1 she was extubated but had difficulty
managing her secretions she was electively re-intubated on POD#2
. She was also found to have expanding edema in her hemorrhage
site and a right temporal infarct. She was started on hypertonic
saline with good effect her exam improved the saline continued
for 3 days. On [**5-9**] she developed fevers pan cultures showed a
left lower lobe pneumonia and sputum grew H. Influeza and a
urinary tract infection with ecoli in her urine, her foley was
changed.She was started on Vanco and Ceftaz and later changed to
Levaquin due to a rash which was thought to be related to
Dilantin which was also discontinued and changed to Keppra. She
is currently being treated with Levaquin until [**5-20**]. She had
PEG and trach on [**5-10**] she was weaned from the vent on [**5-11**]. A follow up chest xray on [**5-13**] showed a resolving
pneumonia but some air in the diaphram a flueroscopy study
showed no air leak and she was cleared by the general surgeon
for discharge. Her WBC count has been between 14-17 last few
days. She has no fever and resolving pneumonia on CXR. The WBC
should be followed closely. Her wound was clean and dry healing
well. There is some csf under the flap which is resolving her
head should be kept greater than 30 degrees. Neurologically on
discharge she has a right gaze preference, follows commands on
the right side and plegic on the left. She will knod or mouth
appropriate answers to questions.
