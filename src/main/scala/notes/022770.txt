Studies:
[**7-22**] Duplex Doppler Abd/Pelvis: 1. Findings compatible with
cirrhosis.
2. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. 3.
Although evaluation is limited by patient's inability to
breath-hold, flow
could not definitely be detected in the main portal vein and
there is possible reversal of flow in the left portal vein.
Dedicated liver Doppler is recommended during normal business
hours to further evaluate for portal vein thrombosis.

[**7-23**] CTA Abd/Pelvis: 1. Findings consistent with cirrhosis with
ascites, nodular heterogenous liver and multiple varices. 2. No
discrete arterially enhancing liver lesions seen. 3. Possible
stenosis at the celiac artery origin. 4. Right pleural effusion
with associated atelectasis. 5. Estimated liver volume 1616cm3,
estimated splenic volume 514.5cm3.

[**7-23**] CXR: Mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion. Acute
interstitial pulmonary edema.

[**7-24**] Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrial
pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and
arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-20**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular systolic function. Mild to
moderate mitral regurgitation.

[**8-18**] CXR: Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of
lower SVC.
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is no change in
pulmonary edema and bilateral right more than left at least
moderate pleural effusion. The left subclavian line tip is at
the superior SVC.

9/2 Persantine Stress MIBI: Patient received 0.142mg/kg/min of
IV Persantine infused over 3.15 minutes. She complained of
nausea, chest tightness and shortness of breath at 3 minutes
