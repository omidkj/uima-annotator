Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization

[**2140-1-8**]
1. Coronary artery bypass grafting x3:  Left internal
    mammary artery to left anterior descending artery, and
    reverse saphenous vein graft to the first diagonal
    artery and the obtuse marginal artery.
2. Pericardial patch closure of the atrial septal defect.


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 76 year old male with history of diabetes,
hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, who presented to [**Hospital **]Hospital with chest pain, noted to have dynamic ECG
changes and initial troponin of 0.06.  He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for possible intervention.  Patient notes chest pain
starting at [**2158**] on [**2140-1-2**], described as a 'numbing' sensation
radiating down his left arm, [**6-12**] in severity, with no
associated symptoms of dyspnea, nausea, diaphoresis or
palpitations.  The pain started while the patient was ascending
a flight of stairs.  He sat down to rest, and decided to call
the ambulance.  He had been experiencing intermittent chest
pain, with similar characteristics, over the last three weeks.
This episode was more severe and long-lasting, however.  The
chest pain is always in the setting of exertion, usually when
going up steps.  Patient presented to [**Hospital3 17031**], upon
which his pain abated, 45 minutes after starting with sublingual
nitroglycerin.
.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED initial vitals were: T 98.0, HR 93,
BP 139/79, RR 16, O2Sat 96% RA.  Patient was chest pain free
upon arrival. Troponin was 0.15 upon presentation. Patient was
continued on heparin and nitro drip that was started at OSH.
Patient was clopidogrel loaded with 600 mg. CXR was ordered, but
not performed prior to patient leaving the ED. Vitals upon
transfer to cardiology floor were: T 98.6, HR 88, BP 144/70, RR
19, O2Sat 98% 2L NC.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING
-------
Cardiac cath:
1. Coronary angiography demonstrated three-vessel and LMCA
disease. The
LMCA was short and had a complex distal lesion that involved the
ostia
of the LAD and LCx. The LAD had an 80% origin stenosis and
moderate
diffuse disease to 50% stenosis. The LCx had a proximal 80%
stenosis, a
95% proximal stenosis in the first obtuse marginal branch, a 60%

mid-vessel stenosis and a 70% distal stenosis. The RCA had a 95%

proximal stenosis and was occluded in its mid portion. It filled
via
left-to-right collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed moderate systemic
arterial
hypertension.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three-vessel and LMCA disease.
.
Echo:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure
is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal basal inferior
hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
50-55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Doppler parameters
are most consistent with Grade I (mild) left ventricular
diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD.
.
Carotid U/S: Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%.
Left ICA stenosis 40-59%.

Brief Hospital Course:
Medicine/Pre-op course
76 yo M with history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension,
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED from [**Hospital3 17031**] for chest
pain, EKG changes, and trop 0.06, increased to 0.15 at [**Hospital1 18**].
Currently chest pain free.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
-------------
# Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction:  Patient with chest
pain, dynamic EKG changes, and troponin elevations on admission.
Risk factors included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes,
and age.  He received clopidogrel load, and was placed on a
heparin drip.  Patient was chest pain free since presenting to
[**Hospital1 18**].  Catheterization showed 3-vessel disease and he had
clopidogrel wash-out while maintained on a heparin drip in
preparation for CABG. He was also placed on full-dose aspirin
and atorvastatin 80 mg daily, increased from his home dose.
Metoprolol tartrate was initiated, and patient is on valsartan
at home.  He underwent CABG for his 3-vessel disease.
.
INACTIVE ISSUES
---------------
# Diabetes mellitus type 2:  patient is four oral diabetes
medications at home (metformin, glyburide, sitagliptin,
pioglitazone).  His oral medications were held on admission, and
patient was placed on sliding scale insulin.  HbA1C was checked
and was elevated >8.
.
# Hypertension: blood pressure on presentation was slightly
elevated.  Patient was placed on his home doses of metoprolol
and valsartan.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: patiently is currently on atorvastatin at
home.  His dose of statin was increased to 80 mg daily.  Lipid
levels ...
.
# Normocytic anemia: unclear if patient has history of anemia.
- check iron studies
- maintain active type and screen
.
# GERD: patient was continued on his home dose of ranitidine
.
Post Cardiac Surgery Course:
The patient was brought to the operating room on [**2140-1-8**] where
the patient underwent ASD closure and CABG x 3.  Overall the
patient tolerated the p
