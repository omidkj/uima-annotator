Admission Date:  [**2151-1-10**]       Discharge Date: [**2151-1-19**]

Date of Birth:   [**2079-1-15**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Vascular

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ischemic gangrene of the left toes.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 72-year-old white
female with a history of congestive heart failure, aortic
stenosis (status post aortic valve replacement), with
diabetes who was admitted to our institution between [**2150-12-7**] and [**2150-12-30**] with dry gangrene of her toes in
both feet.

She had been living in her daughter's home and was wheelchair
bound as of last month.  She requires lifting for transfer
from bed to chair.  She had a right femoral dorsalis pedis
vein graft done on [**2150-12-10**] and had an eventful
postoperative course.  She developed postoperative delirium
and was evaluated by the Psychiatry Service and was treated
with Haldol.  She required restraints and a one-to-one
sitter. She responded to Haldol but remained lethargic and
minimally responsive.

On [**2150-12-24**], the patient desaturated with oxygen
saturations in the 80s and required intubation and was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.  She was extubated
two to three days later and appeared much brighter and
conversive.

She returns now for a left femoral dorsalis pedis bypass
graft.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  This is a widowed 71-year-old white female.
She lives with her daughter.  She is wheelchair bound.
Currently at [**Hospital3 12564**] since discharge.  She
has had blood transfusions in the past.  She is a former
smoker.  She denies alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
revealed blood pressure was 136/64, heart rate was 80,
respiratory rate was 16, and oxygen saturation was 98% on 2
liters.  General appearance revealed an alert and cooperative
white female with nasal oxygen.  In no acute distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination was unremarkable.
The carotids were palpable bilaterally and without bruits.
Radial pulses were palpable.  Femoral pulses were palpable
and 2+.  Popliteal pulses were not palpable.  The right
dorsalis pedis graft was 2+ with a dopplerable posterior
tibialis signal on the right, and a dopplerable dorsalis
pedis and posterior tibialis signal on the left.  The lungs
revealed diminished breath sounds throughout without
adventitious sounds.  The heart revealed a regular rate and
rhythm.  A 1/6 systolic ejection murmur with a crisp valvular
click.  The abdomen was obese but a benign examination.  Feet
revealed right warmer than the left.  She had dry gangrenous
tips of toes bilaterally with a purplish discoloration
bilaterally and dry eschar on the heels on the left.  The
left medial thigh incision was a small opening with visible
suture in place.  Neurologic examination was unremarkable.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories
obtained revealed complete blood count with a white blood
cell count of 5.2, hematocrit was 32.9, and platelets were
165.  Blood urea nitrogen was 19, creatinine was 1.2, and
potassium was 4.2.  INR was 1.4 on admission.  Her urinalysis
was negative.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray was without congestive
heart failure.

Electrocardiogram revealed with a normal sinus rhythm with an
intraventricular conduction delay, with no acute changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for
anticoagulation prior to undergoing elective
revascularization.

On [**2151-1-12**], the patient underwent a left common
femoral artery to dorsalis pedis bypass graft with in situ
saphenous vein, angioscopy, and valve lysis.  She tolerated
the procedure well and was transferred to the Postanesthesia
Care Unit in stable condition with a palpable graft pulse.

Postoperatively, she remained hemodynamically stable.  Her
postoperative hematocrit was 33.6.  Her creatine kinase was
31.  She continued to do well and was transferred to the
Vascular Intensive Care Unit for continued monitoring and
care.

On postoperative day one, there were no overnight events.
She remained afebrile.  Her hematocrit remained stable.  Her
preoperative medications were begun.  Her diet was advanced
as tolerated.  She remained in the Vascular Intensive Care
Unit to monitor urine output which required Lasix.  Her
[**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain was removed.  She remained in the
Vascular Intensive Care Unit.

On postoperative day two, she was transfused one unit of
packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 28.

On postoperative day three, she continued to require
monitoring in the Vascular Intensive Care Unit.

On postoperative day four, her lines were removed, and she
was transferred to the regular nursing floor for continued
care.  Intravenous heparinization was continued, and
coumadinization was begun for her aortic valve replacement.
The patient had a peripherally inserted central catheter line
placed for vancomycin treatment for her cellulitis of the
incisional area.  She was to receive this for a total of two
weeks and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**] at that time.  Goal INR
is 2.5 to 3.5.  Heparinization should be continued until the
patient is in a steady therapeutic INR state; equal to or
greater than 2.5.  Coumadin dosing should be addressed
according to her INR.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Heparin 700 units intravenously per hour; goal partial
thromboplastin time is 60 to 70.
 2.  Cepacol lozenges p.o. as needed.
 3.  Vancomycin 1 g q.24h. (monitor levels once per week).
 4.  Warfarin 1.5 mg p.o. q.d. (adjust to a goal INR of 2.5
or greater).
 5.  Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d.
 6.  Miconazole powder 2% to effected areas t.i.d.
 7.  Acetaminophen 500 mg to 1000 mg p.o. q.4-6h. as needed.
