Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6483**] is a 52 year old with AML s/p SCT and relapse who
was admitted from the ED to the ICU for neutropenic fever and
hypoxemia. He suffered from multiple medical problems, including
untreatable acute myelocytic leukemia, severe graft vs host
disease, acute kidney injury, and hypoxia likely due to
pneumonia. He passed away in the early morning of [**2176-9-6**]. The
paragraphs below describe in detail the course of his several
medical issues.
.
#Hypoxemia: Pt presented with hypoxemia with O2 sats 89-93% on
50% ventimask, and hypoxia continued to be a problem throughout
this hospitalization. The etiology of this hypoxemia was thought
to be secondary to pneumonia (see below), PE, graft versus host
disease, leukemic infiltration or transfusion related acute lung
injury. Gradual improvement while on stress dose steroids and
broad spectrum antibiotics pointed towards leukemic
infiltration, GVHD or pneumonia as the cause. As pt denied chest
pain, did not clinically have a DVT, and improved with the above
interventions, PE was seen as less likely. Anticoagulation was
never begun in this patient given his thrombocytopenia. Chest CT
showed central bronchial wall thickening, consistent with small
airway disease. No consolidations noted. On exam the patient
continued to have wheezes and he was treated symptomatically
with [**Date Range 1988**] nebulizers and supplemental oxygen. Within the
first 24h sats improved to 94%/6L xNC with frequent duonebs.
After respiratory status improved (and other issues stabilized)
the pt was discharged to [**Date Range 3242**], but later re-presented to the ICU
for worsening hypoxia and increased oxygen requirement. At that
time, WBC bumped from 10 to 15 with predominantly lymphocytes
and monocyte lineages changing, which was suspicious for
leukemic infiltration. Antibiotics were broadened to meropenem
but again cultures were negative. O2 sats were >90% on high-flow
oxygen by facemask. [**Date Range 3242**] and ID consult services continued to
follow. O discharge from the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient remained on a
high-flow oxygen by facemask until time of death.
.
#Possible PNA. Pt was without PNA on imaging but persistent
hypoxia and cough in this chronically immunosuppresed patient
led to agressive antibiotic therapy for possible pneumonia and
pneumonia prophylaxis. Received ongoing Vanc, Zosyn, and
Micofungin. Also received a course of acyclovir and
pentaminidine nebulizer as HSV and PCP prophylaxis,
respectively. Induced sputums were collected multiple times but
cultures were consistently negative, apart from one sputum
culture growing yeast (subsequently negative). He did have
positive beta-glucan and galactomannan labs but these were
difficult to interpret as pt was on zosyn at the time, which can
make these labs falsely positive. The patient became acutely
hypoxic on his most recent stay in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after an episode of
emesis. CXR was concernign for aspiration, and the patient's
antibiotic coverage was broadened to include meorpenem.
.
#GVHD: Patient has suspected intestinal GVHD, with copious
volume (100cc/hour) guaiac-negative liquid stool. Antibiotic
therapy for C diff was started prophylactically. Repletion with
D5 1/2 NS with 20 mEq KCl and 20 mEq HCO3- was begun at 100
cc/hour to make up for his diarrheal losses. This was
discontinued when pt became fluid overloaded with bibasilar
crackles and elevated JVD. Given presentation with large-volume
liquid stools and cultures negative for shigella, campylobacter,
yersinia, and c diff toxin, he was started on stress-dose
solumedrol 60mg [**Hospital1 **], made NPO and TPN was initiated for bowel
rest. Loperamide and opium tincture were startedv for
symptomatic control. CT scan of the abdomen showed submucosal
fat-deposition
