Date of Birth:   [**2125-1-21**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 54 year old
white female with a history of hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia, and smoking history, who was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] with
acute anterior myocardial infarction, status post failed
thrombolysis at outside hospital.

The patient reports onset of symptoms on the morning of
admission of acute midback pain with eventual radiation to
the chest, seven out of ten, with radiation to her left upper
extremity with associated shortness of breath, nausea and
diaphoresis.

She called EMS within five minutes and was brought to [**Hospital3 6454**] Emergency Department where she was found to have
anterior ST elevations in V1 through V4.  She was given
Morphine 2 mg intravenously times two, sublingual
Nitroglycerin and Nitroglycerin drip, Heparin and Reteplase
times two.

Per records, she arrived at the [**Hospital3 1280**] Emergency
Department at 10:40 a.m.  Symptom onset was approximated to
be at 10:00 a.m.  She received her first dose of Reteplase at
10:53 a.m. and her second dose at 11:23 a.m.  Her symptoms
did not improved and her ST elevation persisted and she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
emergent catheterization.

She arrived at the catheterization laboratory at 1:30 p.m.
At cardiac catheterization, she was found to have a tortuous
coronary circulation with a totally occluded distal left
anterior descending which was stented with timi two flow post
and complicated by grade B dissection distally.  She was
given intracoronary vasodilators and no further intervention
was pursued.  Her left circumflex, right coronary artery and
left main coronary artery were without significant disease.

A left ventriculogram was performed and notable for
anteroapical and inferoapical akinesis with an ejection
fraction of 40%.

Right heart cardiac catheterization revealed pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure of 18 and right atrial pressure of
13.  Postprocedure, she was given full dose Integrilin for 18
hours.

Upon arrival to the CCU, she had the chief complaint of
nausea but denied shortness of breath or chest pain.

or myocardial infarction.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives in [**Location 38080**] with
husband.  She has two children.  She has smoked one pack per
day since college.  She has one to two cocktails per night.
Recently laid off.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, temperature is
afebrile, blood pressure 135/74, heart rate 90, respiratory
rate 16, oxygen saturation 98% on two liters.  In general,
the patient is somnolent in no apparent distress.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat - The pupils are equal, round,
and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements are intact.  Mucous membranes are mildly dry.  The
neck is soft, supple, no lymphadenopathy, jugular venous
distention, thyromegaly or masses.  Cardiac examination -
regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, S4 gallop.  The lungs
are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen is soft,
nondistended, nontender, no organomegaly or masses,
normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities - right groin with
small hematoma.  Extremities without edema, warm and with
good distal pulses.  Neurologically, the patient is alert and
oriented times three, grossly nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 15.8, hematocrit 36.5,
platelets 238,000.  INR 1.1.  Sodium 137, potassium 4.7,
blood urea nitrogen 7, creatinine 0.6, glucose 150.  CK peak
1148, CK MB peak 150.

Initial electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm, normal axis,
intervals, 2.[**Street Address(2) 2811**] elevations in V2 through V4 with
peaked T waves, 1.[**Street Address(2) 2811**] elevations in I and II, 0.[**Street Address(2) 38081**] elevations in V5 and V6.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Coronary artery disease - Status post acute anterior
myocardial infarction, total occlusion of the distal left
anterior descending, status post left anterior descending
stent, complicated by distal dissection and with timi two
flow post intervention.  The patient was hemodynamically
stable throughout her hospitalization.  Her CK peaked at 1148
and then trended down.  She was treated with Integrilin for
18 hours postcatheterization and then received Aspirin,
Plavix, beta blocker and ace inhibitor.  She was also started
on Lipitor for a lipid panel with total cholesterol of 249,
and LDL of 143.  She will be discharged on Aspirin, Plavix to
finish one month course, Atenolol, Zestril and Lipitor.

2.  Pump - Left ventriculogram during cardiac catheterization
was notable for apical akinesis and ejection fraction of 40%.
She had no signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure
during her hospitalization.  She was started on beta blocker
and ace inhibitor as above.  Given her apical akinesis, she
was started on anticoagulation initially with Heparin drip
and then with low molecular weight Heparin as well as
Coumadin.  She will be discharged on Lovenox and Coumadin, to
have INR followed up as an outpatient.

3.  Electrophysiology - The patient with no adverse events on
telemetry during her hospitalization except for rare
premature ventricular contractions.

4.  Hematology - The patient with right groin hematoma,
status post cardiac catheterization.  She was also noted on
the following evening to have a bruit over that area.  An
ultrasound revealed 1.7 by 2.0 centimeter pseudoaneurysm
which was treated with thrombin injection with good result.
Her anticoagulation was held temporarily during these events
and then restarted without complications.  At the time of
discharge, the patient still has residual ecchymosis over her
right lower extremity as well as a small but stable hematoma.

5.  Gastrointestinal - The patient had no gastrointestinal
symptoms during her hospitalization and was continued on her
outpatient regimen of Asacol and Rowasa enemas.  She received
stress dose steroids pericatheterization and then was
switched to a p.o. Prednisone taper starting at 60 mg to be
tapered down to her baseline of 20 mg.

6.  Endocrine - The patient has been on Prempro as an
outpatient.  This was held in the setting of her acute
myocardial infarction but she will be able to restart this as
an outpatient.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. once daily.
2.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. once daily, to continue one month
course.
3.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. once daily.
4.  Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous times three more doses.
5.  Zestril 2.5 mg p.o. once daily.
6.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. once daily.
7.  Prednisone taper down to 20 mg once daily.
