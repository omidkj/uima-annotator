History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 13013**] is a 39 yo female with h/o Bipolar and
Schizoaffective disorder who presents from [**Hospital3 **]
with hypoxia. Per report, pt had been having mild respiratory
complaints recently. Mother notes that the patient complained of
lip and eye swelling on Friday and was seen at [**Hospital **]
hospital. She was cleared medically and then admitted to
[**Hospital3 **] for benzo detox. At [**Hospital1 **], she was
noted to have LE edema and hypoxia and so was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED. In the ED, her O2 sat was normal, workup was only
notable for 3+ LE edema and elevated bicarb. When her mother saw
her on the following day, she noted that the pt's "body looked
swollen". On routine vitals earlier today she was found to have
a RA sat in the mid-80s. On repeat check, her sat was 94%, but
then dropped to the mid-80s again. EMS was called. On their
arrival, once again her sat was in the mid 80s with a good
tracing. She was placed on a non-rebreather mask and brought to
[**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: T 97.2, BP 117/74, HR 101, R 32,
O2 sat 89% on supplemental O2 (unclear how much). Exam was only
notable for intermittent agitation, no respiratory distress,
lungs clear, mild LE swelling. Pt was noted to desat to 70-80s
on RA with purplish tint to lips and requiring 10L supplemental
O2. ABG was 7.37/70/48 on RA with lactate 0.8. No leukocytosis.
Negative serum tox. CXR was clear. CTA chest negative for PE.
Patient was given neb with minimal effect. Also received
solumedrol, ceftriaxone, motrin, risperdal and ativan. She was
admitted to the MICU for further evaluation.
.
On the floor, she has no complaints. She denies SOB, chest pain,
chest tightness, cough. Repeat ABG on NRB was 7.31/75/126. When
taken off of NRB, her O2 sats drifted to the low 80s and pt did
complain of some SOB.

Lung Scan ([**2101-4-14**]):  Prelim read - no evidence of shunt

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 39 year old female with schizoaffective and bipolar
disorder who presents with hypoxia and hypercarbia.

# Hypoxia: Patient presented with significant hypoxia with
oxygen saturations occasionally falling into the 60s on room
air. Etiology of hypoxia appeared to be multifactorial.  On
presentation patient was severely sedated.  This hypoventilation
with subsequent atelectasis was a significant contributor.
After sedating psychiatric medications were held her hypoxia and
hypercarbia mildly improved and her symptoms resolved.  Echo
with bubble study was performed that ruled out any septal
defects or cardiac malformations that could be causing a shunt.
CTA showed no evidence of PE.  EKG was without ischemic changes,
cardiac enzymes were negative and telemetry was without events.
Echo and chest x-ray showed no evidence of pulmonary effusion or
CHF. PFTs supported significant underlying COPD--degree of which
was surpising for patient's 25 year smoking history.  She also
had diminished diffusion capacity on PFTs but without clear
evidence of interstitial edema or fibrosis on imaging. She had
no fever or leukocytosis during admission but infiltrate on CT
chest suggested infectious etiology so patient was treated with
a 5 day course of levaquin.  The Pulmonary team followed this
patient throughout her admission. They determined that the
patient likely has a chronic hypoventilation syndrome.  This
hypoventilation in setting of underlying COPD, sedation,
obesity, and pneumonia is likely responsible for this patient's
hypoxia and hypercarbia on admission. During her admission
patient's saturations improved.  At time of discharge she was
maintaining saturations greater than 90% on room air while
awake.  With ambulation she would occasionally fall to 88%.  At
night, however, patient's oxygen saturations would fall to
80-85%.  Would strongly consider outpatient sleep study to
evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea. Patient has a BMI of 30
but would likely benefit from weight loss. Sedating meds such as
Depakote were held and benzos were minimized as much as
possible. Patient will require night-time oxygen therapy via
nasal cannula when discharged. She was counseled at length about
the risks of smoking to her lungs and in the setting of
supplemental oxygen.  She did not smoke during her admission and
was continued on nicotine patches after discharge. Patient will
be followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 437**] in Pulmonary Clinic.

# Hypercarbia: Patient presented with diminished breath sounds
and rapid respiratory rate exacerbating likely chronic
hypoventilation. With smoking history, paraseptal emphysema on
CT, and PFTs support diagnosis of COPD. Patient did not appear
to have contributory muscular weakness on exam. She was started
on spiriva and advair with albuterol prn.

# Bipolar/Schizoaffective Disorder: Known history of bipolar and
schizoaffective disorder would give patient limited reserve in
the setting of hypoxia, hypercarbia, and hospitalization in an
unfamiliar setting. No other electrolyte abnormalities, no
underlying infectious process.  Restarted outpatient psychiatric
medications with exception of depakote and clonazepam and
minimized sedating medications.  Patient was followed by the
Psychiatry team throughout admission.  They agreed with the
medication changes.  Patient did well throughout
hospitalization.  She was very cooperative with limited evidence
of psychosis.

# Pediculosis:  Dermatology consulted. Recommended medicated
shampoo and oral ivermectin x 2 separated by one week.  Lice
