History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 32595**] is a 55 yo male with EtOH cirrhosis (hx of SBP and
hepatic encephalopathy), DM who presented to Dr.[**Name (NI) 948**] office
today for a regular appointment.  There, he was noted to have a
systolic BP in the 60s and reported lightheadedness for the past
2-3 days.  He was sent to the emergency department, where his
initial BP was 90/48.  He reports one week of LH that he
describes as discoordination/stumbling as well as fogginess like
he has when becoming encephalopathic.  He also has had decreased
PO liquid intake and decreased UOP.  He denies F/C, abd pain,
changes in stool, BRBPR, melena, dysuria.  He does report
productive cough x 1.5 weeks and a sick contact in his wife.  [**Name (NI) **]
was recently admitted at [**Hospital3 **] for 5 days for RLE
cellulitis in which he was d/c's one week ago and finished a
course of keflex 2 days ago.  He was recetnly of his lasix dose
during that stay [**1-16**] increased creatinine, but it was restarted
upon his discharge.  His home dose of aldactone was stopped 1.5
weeks ago.  He has had no other changes in his medications and
ocntinues to take his lactulolse, titrated to [**4-19**] BMs daily.  He
had a 7L by para yesterday at [**Hospital3 3583**] (no cell count in
their system), 10L last week.
.
In the ED, he recieved a 500cc bolus with improvement in his BP
to 101/59.  His CXR showed worsening L pleural effusion and he
was given vanc/ceftaz.  A paracentesis was not performed
reportedly because of concern about his platelets being 21 and
INR 1.8.  He was afebrile, HR in the 60s, and satting 99% on RA.

Brief Hospital Course:
MEDICINE Course:
55 yo with EtOH cirrhosis admitted for hypotension who was found
to have ESBL Ecoli PNA and new ARF believed to be 2/2 HRS now on
HD but may also have a component of ATN from hypotension. He was
transferred off of Medicine for a liver [**Year (4 digits) **].
.
#. Cirrhosis: Chronic issue, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**]. Due to past
etOH abuse. Sober for many years. Complicated by HRS.
Encephalopathy was managed with high doses of lactulose and
rifamixin. Definitively treated with liver [**Last Name (STitle) **] (see
Surgery course).
.
#. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Pt developed PAF this
admission with rapid ventricular response. He has converted back
into sinus each time spontaneously. Once his BP was somewhat
unstable for SBPs around 80. He has known atrial dilation and is
likely sensitive to hypervolemia stretching his atria and
causing Afib. Started on metoprolol with good effect.
.
#. Hepatic encephalopathy: Worsened in the context of infection
early in the admission. Improved with management of his PNA and
high doses of lactulose + rifaximin 600 mg PO BID.
.
#. Renal failure: Concern for HRS with worsening creatinine
despite IVF and albumin. Given his hypotension early in the
admission in the context of spesis, there may be a component of
ATN which may be recoverable. Renal u/s WNL. Nephrology involved
and patient had tunneled SC right side placed [**2147-2-13**], started HD
[**2147-2-13**].
.
#. Ecoli/Klebsiella Pneumonia/RLE cellulitis: Growing Ecoli and
Klebsiella both sensitive to meropenem from sputum. BCx and
ascites Cx are negative. Treated with meropenem for known Ecoli
and Klebsiella PNA. Plan for total of 14 days of treatment to be
completed on [**2147-2-24**], but transferred to surgery prior to that
time. Repeat PA and LAT CXR with improving edema and no signs of
focal infiltrate prior to surgery.
.
#. Pancytopenia: chronic, thought [**1-16**] hepatic dysfunction.
Transfuse for PLU < 10 or active bleeding. Transfuse for HCT <
21 or active bleeding.
.
#. DM2: Chronic issue. On ISS + glargine.
.
MICU Course:
1) Hypotension:  Patient presented with hypotension with
systolic BP's in 60's while sleeping.  He reported some
lightheadedness, but was mentating throughout.  He initially
received significant fluid resuscitation, albumin, and blood
products with refractory blood pressure.  He was never febrile
or tachycardic, and WBC was initially at baseline ~2,000.
Nonetheless, infectious work-up was pursued with a diagnostic
paracentesis performed at time of admission to the ICU.
Peritoneal fluid showed only 56 WBC's and culture was negative.
He was started empirically on Levofloxacin for empiric coverage
of a community-acquire pneumonia.  On the day following
admission, a diagnostic thoracentesis of his left pleural
effusion was performed, with removal of 1 liter serosanguinous
transudative fluid.   Gram stain was negative and cultures were
without growth.  Due to persistently low BP's, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 104**] stim test
was performed to rule out adrenal insufficiency with appropriate
result 11.7 -> 19.7.  His home dose of Nadolol was held.  TTE
revealed dilated atria but preserved systolic function.  A
central line was placed and CVP measured at 33, following fluid
resuscitation.  BP's remained low for ~24 hours in the ICU, and
antibiotic coverage was subsequently broadened to Vancomycin,
Meropenem, and Levofloxacin.  Sputum culture eventually grew an
ESBL e.coli and pan-sensitive klebsiella organism.  Vancomycin
was discontinued, and patient was continued on Meropenem.

2) Acute renal failure:  On [**2-9**], patient was noted to have
decreased urine output in the setting of hypotension.  He voided
400 cc in the morning and subsequently did not void for ~24
hours.  Bladder scan revealed urinary retention.  Foley
placement attempt was unsuccessful and Urology was called.
