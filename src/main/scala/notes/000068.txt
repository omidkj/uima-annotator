Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3190**]
Chief Complaint:
?Guillain-[**Location (un) **]


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy and bronchial lavage: 8/3
[**2162-7-29**] 1. Total laminectomy of C3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.
2. Fusion C3 to 7.
3. Autograft and allograft.


History of Present Illness:
82 y/o male with PMHx breast CA s/p mastectomy in [**5-/2162**] c/b
right frozen shoulder, squamous cell CA of the penis s/p
resection, glaucoma who is being transferred for concern of
Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome.  Per the pt's niece, he was in his
usual state of health until [**7-24**], when he fell while unloading a
piece of furniture from his car.  Per OSH notes, he did not lose
conciousness nor complain of any cardiac prodrome - he felt this
was a mechanical fall.  He was too weak to get up on his own and
was on the ground for ~2 hours prior to being found by his
neighbor.  [**Name (NI) **] was taken to [**Hospital3 **] and admitted to a
telemetry unit.  He was noted to have elevated CK, which peaked
at 3320, then trended down with IVF.  Cardiology was consulted
but felt this was a mechanical fall and had planned to obtain an
echocardiogram.  On [**7-25**], the patient was noted to have
increased weakness and progressed to a feeling of an inability
to move his extremities on [**7-26**].  Shortly after this, he became
bradycardic and hypotensive and went into respiratory failure.
He was intubated, had CPR performed, then was transferred to the
CCU.  He was intermittently on pressors and was felt to have
developed an aspiration pneumonia.  He was initially on
clindamycin, then broadened to vancomycin and cefepime.  His O2
requirement improved and there were plans to extubate him on
[**7-28**], however a NIF was noted to be -10 and the patient was noted
to have complete paralysis of bilateral extremities.  CT was
negative, neuro consulted and felt he may have an ascending
paralysis such as GBS and recommended transfer to a tertiary
care facility.
.
In the ICU, the patient is intubated.  He is able to shake his
head yes and no to questions.

.
Imaging:
CXR ([**7-28**]):
MR [**Name13 (STitle) **] ([**8-24**]: FINDINGS: There is exaggerated lordosis of the
cervical spine. There is
minimal retrolisthesis of C4 over C5 vertebra by 4 mm. The
vertebral bodies
are normal in height and marrow signal intensity. There is no
evidence of
acute fracture.
Prevertebral soft tissue is noted from C1 to C5 level.

Hyperintensity is noted in posterior paraspinal muscles and soft
tissues from
C1 to C6 levels. A small hypointense area is noted in right
paraspinal
muscles at the C7-T1 level measuring 1.8 x 1.4 x 1.7 cm in
craniocaudad, AP,
and transverse dimensions. This likely represents calcification.


There is multilevel disc degenerative disease. There is
desiccation of all
cervical intervertebral discs.

At C2-C3 level, there is no significant spinal canal or neural
foraminal
narrowing.

At C3-C4 level, there is a broad-based posterior disc protrusion
causing
indentation and compression of spinal cord. There is severe
spinal canal
stenosis. The disc with uncovertebral and facet osteophytes
causes moderate
bilateral foraminal stenosis.

At C4-C5, there is posterior disc protrusion causing indentation
and
compression of the spinal cord and severe spinal canal
narrowing. The disc
with uncovertebral and facet osteophytes causes moderate right
and mild left
foraminal narrowing.

At C5-C6, there is diffuse posterior disc bulge causing
indentation of the
anterior subarachnoid space. There is no evidence of significant
spinal canal
or neural foraminal narrowing.

At C6-C7 level, there is diffuse posterior disc bulge without
significant
spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.

Hyperintense signal is noted in cervical spinal cord from C2 to
C7 level.
This likely represents combination of compressive edema and
contusion
secondary to fall.


Brief Hospital Course:
82 y/o male with PMHx breast CA s/p mastectomy in [**5-/2162**] c/b
right frozen shoulder, squamous cell CA of the penis s/p
resection, glaucoma with neurologic signs concerning for
cervical spine injury vs GBS vs myositis.
.
# Weakness/paralysis - Concerning for cervical spine injury (may
have occurred during intubation) vs ascending paralysis such as
GBS vs myositis/myopathy given elevated CK on admission.
Patient has no clear history of prodromal illness for GBS, but
this is not necessary for the diagnosis.  CK trending down
without any intervention for myositis making it less likely.  MR
[**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] performed early [**7-29**] showed chronic DJD of C-spine with
significant narrowing of spinal canal, compression of spinal
cord, and associated edema from C3-T1.  Spine surgery was
consulted and felt that the paralaysis is secondary to spinal
cord compression with poor prognosis if patient taken to the OR
and very low probability of recovery of any function.  Spine
surgery had a discussion with family who chose to pursue
surgical repair.

.
# Hypoxemic respiratory failure - [**1-27**] diaphragmatic weakness and
pneumonia/mucus plugging.  CXR on presentation showed complete
whiteout of left lung - bronchoscopy the evening of [**7-28**] showed
copious amounts of mucus plugging that was suctioned out.  Post
bronch, has been able to be weaned to 60% FiO2.  A repeat CXR on
[**7-29**] showed substantial improvement, with possible consolidation
in the LLL.  Due to neuromuscular dysfunction, he was continued
on ventilation.
.
# HCAP - Signs of LLL PNA seen on bronchoscopy with edematous,
red airways.  Was thought to have aspirated at OSH and covered
with vanco/cefepime.  Has been in hospital > 48 hours so needs
to be covered for HCAP.  Plan to continue coverage and request
sputum culture results from OSH.
.
# Thrombocytopenia - Platelets of 114 on [**7-28**], down from 147 on
admission to OSH.  No signs of spontaneous bleeding at this
time.  Differential includes med effect vs decreased production.
.
# Anemia - Mild normocytic ane
