MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2117-8-4**]):    No MRSA isolated.

RADIOLOGY:
[**2117-7-29**] CHEST PORT:
IMPRESSION:
1. The tip of the left PICC line is positioned in the mid SVC.
2. Marked right-sided mediastinal shift, with right middle lobe
atelectasis, unchanged in appearance.
[**2117-8-1**] CHEST PORT:
There is new left upper lung consolidation as well as new left
basal opacity, findings that are highly concerning for interval
development of aspiration or rapidly progressing infection.
Small right pleural effusion is unchanged. There is also no
change in the right mediastinal shift. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax.
[**2117-8-1**] CHEST CTA:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of central pulmonary embolism or acute aortic
pathology.
2. Right middle lobe complete atelectasis/collapse with
cardiomediastinal
shift to the right.
3. Asymmetric left pulmonary interstitial edema
[**2117-8-2**] CHEST PORT:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**8-1**], there is
continued increased opacification involving much of the left
lung. The findings are again worrisome for diffuse aspiration or
pneumonia. Mediastinal shift to the right is again seen.
[**2117-8-2**] ABD PORT:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of ileus or obstruction.
[**2117-8-3**] CHEST PORT:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**8-2**], there appears to
be some
decrease in the diffuse opacification involving much of the left
lung. Again, the findings are concerning for diffuse aspiration
or pneumonia. Mediastinal shift to the right is again seen.




Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General Surgical Service for
treatment of his chronic cholecystitis and cholelithiasis .  On
[**2117-7-29**], the patient underwent open cholecystectomy with open
common bile duct exploration and choledochoduodenostomy biliary
bypass, which went well without complication (reader referred to
the Operative Note for details). After a brief, uneventful stay
in the PACU, the patient arrived on the floor NPO, on IV fluids
and antibiotics, with a foley catheter, and epidural catheter
with Bupivacaine and Morphine PCA for pain control. Post
operatively patient had hypotension with SBP 70-80s, which was
corrected with fluid boluses. On POD # 1, Acute Pain service
increased patient's bupivacaine rate and after that patient's
SBP decreased to 66. Patient was triggered, APS was called and
epidural catheter was removed. After removal of epidural,
patient's SBP improved to 110-120s and continue to be WNL during
hospitalization. Post-operatively, the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course
is as follows by systems:

Neuro: Patient has a history of chronic Percocet use for his
chronic pain. Post operatively, patient was started on epidural
with bupivacaine and Morphine PCA. Epidural was discontinued on
POD # 1 s/t low blood pressure. Patient was continue on Morphine
PCA with good effect and adequate pain control.  When tolerating
oral intake, the patient was transitioned to oral pain
medications. Currently he is on Oxycodone 10-15 mg Q4H. Patient
instructed to continue f/u with his PCP regarding chronic pain
management and refills for pain medication.

CV: On POD #1, patient had episodes of hypotension, which though
to be related to epidural catheter. After removal of epidural
catheter, patient's BP was WNL. The patient remained stable from
a cardiovascular standpoint; vital signs were routinely
monitored.

Pulmonary: Patient is a current smoker and has a history of
COPD. Postoperatively his O2 Sats were 99% on 3L n/c.
Pulmonology was consulted and their recommendations were
followed. On POD#3, patient was triggered, he desaturated to 70s
on 5L n/c and patient was transferred in ICU for further
management. In ICU, chest radiogram was concerning for new onset
of pneumonia. Patient was started on antibiotics and aggressive
nebulizers. On POD # 4, patient's respiratory status stabilized
and he was transferred back on the floor. On the floor patient
was continue on supplemental O2, abx and nebulizers treatment.
Pulmonology recommended home O2 on disc
