History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 23203**] is a 78 year old male with h/o HTN, AAA, CVA and TIA,
found slumped over in a chair, unresponsive with ?new L facial
droop at his nursing home this a.m.  Of note, he was admitted 1
year ago in [**5-24**] with the exact same chief complaint,
additionally with slurred speech s/p reported fall and question
of incontinence.  A head CT at the time was negative for acute
stroke, MRI showed chronic microvascular disease, an old left
thalamic lacunar infarct, and MRA with some moderate stenosis in
the proximal to mid portion of his basilar artery.  His
neurologic deficits, thought to be a TIA, resolved, and he was
discharged on ASA 325 mg daily.

Report from the nursing home this morning is minimal.  He was
reportedly found slumped on his side in a chair in his room,
minimally responsive.  T 96, HR 60, BP 122/60.  Sent to [**Hospital1 18**]
ED.

Vitals on arrival to the ED were T 101, HR 111, BP 155/48, RR
28, 96% on 2L O2.  Given his fever, AMS, and a new petechial
rash that was noted, an LP was perfored: 3 WBC, 1 RBC, prot 47,
glucose 138.  He was pan cultured and started on
ceftriaxone/vancomycin.  UA negative.  Head CT negative for
acute process.  MRI head was negative for acute stroke, with
mild basilar artery stenosis and extensive white matter disease
seen on previous MRI that has progressed.  He was tachypneic,
with ABG 7.46/30/60, subsequently intubated.  Labs notable for
mild leukocytosis of 12.6, lactate 10; he had a central line
placed and was started on sepsis protocol, with lactate
decreasing to 8.6 then 2.8 with IVF.  CK 2184, increasing to
5000, though MBI wnl.  Trop 0.05.  Amylase was 512, lipase 53,
CT abdomen with consolidation/atelectasis at L lung base,
otherwise no intra-abdominal source for fever.

IMAGING:
Admission CXR:
1. Left lower lobe atelectasis and probable pleural effusion.
Pneumonia in this region cannot be excluded.
2. Minor linear atelectasis at the right lung base.

CT HEAD: Study somewhat limited by motion and streak artifact.
No definite evidence of acute infarction. Chronic small vessel
infarction.

MRI/MRI HEAD:
1) No evidence of acute infarction or an infectious process.
2) Multiple small foci of likely chronic hemorrhage within the
basal ganglia, corona radiata, and brainstem; the etiology is
most likely secondary to chronic hypertensive hemorrhages. Less
likely differential considerations would include amyloid
angiopathy and occult arteriovenous malformations.
3) Multifocal elevated T2/FLAIR signal suggesting chronic
microvascular infarction.
4) Moderate stenosis of the proximal basilar artery. The
cerebral vessels are otherwise unremarkable.

CT ABDOMEN:
1) No definite source of fever/infection identified.
2) Bibasilar consolidation/atelectasis; correlate with clinical
picture for possible early pneumonia.
3) Atypical appearing fluid filled structure adjacent to the
bladder, which may represent a bladder diverticulum or
neobladder; correlate with urologic/surgical history.
4) Simple right kidney cyst.
5) Left lateral chest wall subcutaneous edema, which is likely
dependent.

EKG:  Sinus tachycardia, LAD, early R wave progression.  Not
significantly changed from prior.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  78 year old male with h/o HTN, AAA, CVA and TIA, p/w
lethargy, L facial droop (?old), found to have mild
leukocytosis, fever, lactate of 10, ?PNA on CXR and CT.

1) Sepsis:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for code sepsis
based on elevated WBC count, elevated lactate, tachypneia.  It
was felt that the likely source was PNA.  His UA was negative,
CT abdomen negative for acute intra-abdominal process.  LP
showed 3 wbc, normal fluid studies, making meningitis unlikely.
C. Diff negative.  He was aggressively hydrated and lactate
dropped precipitously within the first 12 hours.  He was started
on broad spectrum antibiotics - ceftriaxone and vancomycin, as
well as azithromycin to cover atypical pneumonia which was later
discontinued given low clinical suspicion.  He remained afebrile
after the first day, with improvement in leukocytosis.  He
remained hemodynamically stable, and in fact became hypertensive
by his 2nd hospital day.  He was called out to the floors after
2 days in the ICU. On the floor the patient continued to
improve. He remained afebrile throughout and his sputum cultures
from the MICU grew MRSA. He was kept on IV vanco and ceftriaxone
and will be discharged with these medications to finish a 10 day
course.

It is unclear whether or not his PNA was the primary event, or
whether he had a viral syndrome with lethargy and resultant
aspiration pneumonia given the bilaterality of the pneumonia and
relative obtundation on admission.  He was kept on aspiration
precautions on the floor.  A swallow evaluation post-extubation
demonstrated good swallowing but difficulty handling his own
secretions. It was repeated on [**2134-7-23**] and the patient passed
swallow evaluation.

2) Hypoxic respiratory failure:  He was intubated in the ED
secondary to concern for impending airway compromise given his
altered level of consciousness and borderline ABG.  He was
maintained on AC for 1 day and extubated within 24 hours.
Pneumonia probably contributed to his initially mild A-a
gradient.  His
