Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1854**]
Chief Complaint:
Headache SAH seen on outside CT

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Coil embolization of the left posterior communicating artery


History of Present Illness:
85 year old male developed sudden onset of severe headache
approximately 1 week ago. The pain was described as sharp, [**8-9**]
radiating throughout his head and down into his neck. He felt
that this would go away, and today decided that since the
headache had not changed he would seek medical care. The patient

has had no numbness, paresthesias, or weakness. He was seen at
an
OSH where a CT revealed a SAH and then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care.

Head CT  [**11-17**]
FINDINGS: Patient is status post aneurysm coiling, with adjacent
beam hardening artifact limiting assessment of the parenchyma in
this locale. There remains hemorrhage layering dependently
within the lateral ventricles. Subarachnoid blood in the left
posterior parietal sulci is somewhat more prominent. Small focus
of either subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhage to the right of
the superior falx. Small amount of subarachnoid blood, also in
the sulci to the left of the superior falx. Stable appearance of
subarachnoid blood _in several right parietal sulci appears more
prominent than on the prior study. There is diffuse
periventricular white matter changes consistent with chronic
small vessel infarction. No specific CT findings to suggest
acute major vascular territorial infarction. Ventricles are
minimally dilated but unchanged since the prior study. Likely
small amount of subdural blood layering along the tentorium,
unchanged.
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post aneurysmal coiling; evolving subarachnoid
hemorrhage in distribution described above. Several of the foci
appear more prominent than on [**2136-11-15**]. No specific CT evidence
of major vascular territorial infarction.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
85 year old man with 6mm aneurysm at left ICA-MCA junction
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please eval anuerysm size and ability to coil vs clip
PROCEDURE: Cerebral angiogram and coil embolization of cerebral
aneurysm.
HISTORY:
85-year-old patient status post subarachnoid hemorrhage from
ruptured posterior communicating artery aneurysm identified on
CTA, referred by the neurosurgical service for angiography and
coil embolization if amenable.
ASSISTANT: [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.
TECHNIQUE:
The patient was brought to the angiography suite and initially
IV conscious sedation provided by the nurse. [**Last Name (Titles) **]-arterial
access was obtained by placing a 6 French Cordis sheath in the
right common femoral artery using single-wall puncture
technique. A 4 French [**Doctor Last Name **] 2 catheter was advanced
coaxially through a tortuous iliac artery and abdominal aorta
into the aortic arch. The catheter was then further advanced
into the left common carotid artery for an angiographic run of
the neck and head. Once this had been reviewed, a 3- dimensional
angiogram was carried out. The images were reconstructed on a
separate workstation. Based on the diagnostic angiogram, it was
decided that the patient was a good candidate for embolization.
The catheter was then removed and general anesthesia induced
without difficulty. The groin sheath was then exchanged for a
long 7 French Cordis sheath which was positioned in the
descending aorta. A 6 French 100-cm [**Last Name (un) 70159**] catheter was then
advanced coaxially through the introducer sheath into the aortic
arch and over a Terumo Glidewire was positioned in the left
common carotid artery and then further advanced into the left
internal carotid artery into a mid cervical position. A repeat
cerebral angiogram was carried out in an optimized working
projection based on the 3D images. An SL10 microcatheter was
then advanced over a Transcend soft tip microwire through the
[**Last Name (un) 70159**] catheter under high magnification road mapping into the
intracranial internal carotid artery. Using microwire
navigation, the microcatheter was then carefully positioned
within the aneurysm sac. GDC coil embolization was then carried
out using first a 3- dimensional GDC-10 5 mm x 8 mm coil. This
was deployed successfully. [**2129**] units of heparin were
administered. Additional coil embolization was carried out with
the following GDC-10 coils: 4 x 6 2DSR, 4 x 6 2DSR, 3 x 4 2 DSR,
and 3 x 4 Ultrasoft. The microcatheter was then removed and a
post- embolization angiogram carried out. All catheters were
then removed and the sheath sutured in place. The patient was
left intubated due to mild hyperthermia for his transfer back to
the ICU.
