Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1620**]
Chief Complaint:
"Not feeling well."

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  placement of R IJ
2.  placement of PICC

History of Present Illness:
Briefly, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with Type 2 DM, HTN,
CRI and history of Klebsiella urosepsis, who is being called out
of the ICU s/p fluid resuscitation and vanco/zosyn for presumed
urosepsis.  She was in her usual state of health until the
morning of admission when she awoke feeling "crummy."  She lives
in a skilled nursing facility, and per her daughter, they found
her cold and clammy, and not looking well.  She was complaining
of back pain.  Additionally, her speech was slurred.  At the
time she was afebrile at 97, bp 150/70, HR 96, RR 22, and 94% on
RA.  Her FS was 102.  EMS transported her to [**Hospital1 18**].

In the ED her vitals were notable for BP 100/50, and tachycardia
of 140 bpm.  Her lactate was 6.6 and code sepsis was called.
She complained of diffuse abdominal pain and a CXR was
questionable for free air, therefore a CT scan was performed
which showed only a small pleural based lingular mass, otherwise
unremarkable.  She was transferred to the MICU.

The patient herself cannot elaborate on any of these events.
She merely states that she was no feeling well, however denies
any focal symptoms.  Her daughter corroborates that she has had
no diarrhea, and has not been complaining of anything.  The
patient reports that her back and legs hurt, however they
frequently hurt and she takes fentanyl for this - attributed to
OA.

CT ABDOMEN PELVIS [**5-4**]:  IMPRESSION:
1) No perforation. No intraabdominal source of infection
identified.
2) Small pulmonary parenchymal density in the lingula, only
partially visualized. This may be a focus of rounded atelectasis
or may be a small mass. Further evaluation with followup chest
x-ray is recommended. A followup chest CT may also be
considered.

CXR [**5-4**]:  SINGLE PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST: There
is left lower lobe atelectasis. The aorta is unfolded. Heart
size is unchanged. No consolidations are seen. Severe
degenerative changes seen in the right humerus. Note is made of
a large amount of air in the stomach.
IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe atelectasis.

CXR [**5-5**]:  L lower lobe pneumonia, moderate CHF with
cardiomegaly.

CT head [**5-7**]:
CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: No intraparenchymal, subarachnoid
or subdural hemorrhage. The ventricles and sulci are prominent,
consistent with age- related involutional change. There is a
decreased attenuation in the parenchymal tissue adjacent to the
ventricles, consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic
infarct. No intracranial mass effect. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
differentiation is preserved. The density of brain parenchyma is
within normal limits. The soft tissue and osseous structures are
normal. In the visualized portions of the axillary, sphenoid and
frontal sinuses, no soft tissue density or air fluid levels are
identified.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage.

CT SINUS: Minimal mucosal thickening, which may represent a
small retention cyst is seen in the right maxillary sinus. No
mucosal thickening or air-fluid levels are identified in the
left maxillary sinus, frontal sinus, ethmoid air cells. There is
a calcific density in an opacified right sphenoid sinus. The
soft tissue and osseous structures are normal. No fracture is
identified. The osseous structures are osteopenic. No soft
tissue inflammatory stranding or fluid collections are
identified.
IMPRESSION: Right maxillary sinus retention cyst and right
sphenoid opacification. No other abnormalities evident. MRI
should be considered for further evaluation.

Brief Hospital Course:
1.  urosepsis - Pt was admitted to MICU, where a central line
was placed for IVF, and vanco/zosyn was started given her
history of Klebsiella UTI and a UA here consistent with UTI.
She received 6L IVF in the first few hours, but then was in net
even fluid balance and was transferred to the floor.  Urine
cultures were consistent with contamination, but pt responded to
IV Zosyn with a down-trending of her fever curve and WBC count.
She was initially placed on vancomycin and Zosyn; the former was
discontinued shortly thereafter.  Pt was hydrated with
additional IVF while on the floor.  A repeat UA showed a marked
decrease in the degree of pyuria, as well as decreased
hematuria.  She was felt to be responding to the Zosyn
clinically, and therefore a PICC was placed for the remainder of
her antibiotics; she will get a 2-week course total.

2. left lower lobe pneumonia - Pt was noted to have a new
infiltrate on CXR.  She was being covered with Zosyn for the
urosepsis as above, and was otherwise asymptomatic and satting
well.  This was not thought to be the major source of infection
causing her sepsis.

3.  hypertension - Pt was noted to be hypertensive on the floor.
 Her metoprolol had been held previously in the setting of her
sepsis, and this was restarted as she became more
hemodynamically stable and was clearly resolved from a sepsis
