Chief Complaint:
dysphagia, mult pna, tracheal stent placed w/ good results, now

History of Present Illness:
 Pt is a 74 y/o male with long-standing tracheobronchial
malacia, CAD s/p CABG [**2133**], PVD, AV-block, COPD, h/o UGIB who
was admitted for tracheobronchoplasty by interventional
pulmonology, after having a silicone Y-stent placed as a
temporizing measure in mid-[**Month (only) 958**]. He first began having symptoms
as a child, with frequent respiratory infections, that resolved
in his 40's but recurred around the time of his CABG. Since
then, he has had frequent pneumonias (5-6 per year) with
year-round copious secretions and severely limiting persistent
shortness of breath. The temporary stent afforded immediate and
significant symptomatic relief, and he was admitted for a more
permanent option.
Bronchitis since childhood, PVD, H/o GI bleed, Hyperlipidemia,
CAD c CABG '[**33**] -> progressive SOB, pul. infect., inability to
clear secretions, dyspnea. Y-stent placement in '[**49**] lead to
immediate relieve, hence scheduled for definitive surgery.
