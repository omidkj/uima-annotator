Brief Hospital Course:
Anethesia placed a pre-operative epidural on [**10-4**]. After on
uncomplicated right thoracotomy and thoracic tracheoplasty with
mesh, right mainstem bronchus/bronchus intermedius bronchoplasty
with mesh, left mainstem bronchoplasty with mesh and right upper
lobe wedge resection, the patient was admitted to the surgical
ICU for further treatment. Due to rhoncherous nature of breath
sounds and the use of oxygen 15 liters by mist mask, the patient
remained in the ICU until [**10-8**]. No bronchoscopy was required.
Chest tube was removed on [**10-7**].  The epidural was removed on [**10-9**].
PT saw the patient and ambulated on [**10-9**].

Due to prolonged nature of the surgery, CPK values were trended
over the first 3 days post-op. On POD1, values were 5014 and
trended downward for the next 2 days. The patient required CPAP
(14 cm H20) while on the floor.

No blood transfusions were required during the hospitalization.
At the time of discharge, the patient was afebrile, without a
WBC count, and saturating well on 2 liters NC.

Due to patient preferences and deconditioning, the patient
requested continued care in a rehabilitation setting. The
patient was discharge on [**2180-10-11**]
