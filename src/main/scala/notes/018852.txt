Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8404**]
Chief Complaint:
asthma exacerbation/anaphylaxis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
epinephrine pen administration

History of Present Illness:
64M with history of CAD s/p CABG and severe asthma who presented
from home with respiratory arrest. He had a recent admission at
an OSH two weeks ago where he underwent ASA desensitization
therapy. He developed wheezing at home today and took 30
prednisone but was then found lying in his back yard cyanotic.
EMS was called. On the scene they reported no air movement. They
were unablet to bag ventilate. He was given epinephrine and had
rapid improvement in symptoms. On arrival to the ED, he was
afebrile, BP 141/78 RR18 and 100% NRB. He was placed on
continuous nebs, given mthylprednisolone 125 IV x1 and magnesium
2g IV. CXR was negative as was troponin. On transfer to the
floor he is [**Age over 90 **]% on room air.
.
Currently feeling much better but anxious. He states that his
symptoms came on relatively suddenly and did not include any
itching/rash/angioedema/runny eyes/rhinorrhea as well as no
chest pain or nausea. He had gone outside because he thought he
might have to call 911 and did not want them to have to manage
opening a locked door. He has had two attacks like this since
his ASA densensitization but was able to take prednisone soon
enough for the prior attack to self-resolve. Prior to the asa
desensitization, his last severe attack requiring ED visit was
30 years ago.
.
His asthma developed at age 20 and is associated with nasal
polyposis and ASA sensitivity. In his 20s, he had frequent ED
visits (sometimes up to three times weekly), but only one
hospital admission and no intubations. He failed and actually
had a paradoxical reaction to inhaled steroids and has been
prednisone dependent for 10 years.

Brief Hospital Course:
64 y/o with h/o severe prednisone dependent asthma (adult onset
with ASA sensitivity, eosinophilia) s/p ASA densitization at [**Hospital1 112**]
two weeks ago with acute asthma attack.
.
# Asthma exacerbation/anaphylactic reaction: Per report, patient
cyanotic at home, which improved with epi pen in field, nebs and
prednisone.  Patient admitted to the MICU for close monitoring.
Trigger felt likely to be aspirin, as asthma previously well
controlled prior to starting ASA following recent ASA
desensitization. There was no evidence of infection (lack of
fever or symptoms). Therefore, aspirin was held. Patient treated
with NEBs q4hr + prn, started on outpatient Montelukast and
Zyflo. Per discussion with allergy and pulmonary, Zyflo was
initiated due to the aspirin desensitization, and can be
stopped, as he will not continue these desensitizations. Patient
started on 60 mg prednisone and then experienced increased
SOB/decreased peak flow consequently started on Solmedrol 125mg
q8hr. He was then transitioned to prednisone 60mg PO daily and
was stable on this regimen for the following 18 hours. We also
held his B-blocker. Peak flow on the day of discharge from the
MICU was 417 and he was without wheeze.
.
The patient's allergist was contact[**Name (NI) **] who agreed with stopping
the aspirin. With regard to follow-up, patient and provider will
be in close communication, but formal appointment is not
required as there is no plan to continue aspirin
desensitization. Pulmonary was consulted, and outpatient
pulmonologist [**Hospital1 112**] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9303**] was the consult attending. With
multidisciplinary discussion, patient will be discharged on
prednisone 60 mg daily (with 2 week taper and to be managed by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9303**], discharged with epi pen for emergency use
(patient educated how to use), and he was continued on
outpatient montelukast. Zyflo was discontinued as his aspirin
desensitatization is discontinued. He is not on inhaled
corticosteroids due to paradoxical allergic reaction. Patient
instructed that as he missed dose is now re-sensitized to
Aspirin and can not re-start taking without risk of worsening
asthma/anaphylaxis. We restarted albuterol and ipratropium INH
PRN. He will discuss with his pulmonologist re long acting
inhaled steroid and long acting anticholinergic and will follow
up with him soon. He will continue to hold B-blocker until
breathing/PEF at baseline.
