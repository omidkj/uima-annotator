Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 19836**]
Chief Complaint:
Nausea and vomiting

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Central venous line placement and removal


History of Present Illness:
This is an 84 year old female with a history of insulin
dependant diabetes and hypertension who presented to the ED with
complaints of vomiting.  This morning she awoke feeling nauseous
and consequently vomited; she also endorsed chest pain but no
associated abdominal pain.  In the ED, she was noted to have
bradycardia to the 30s-40s.  An EKG revealed sinus bradycardia
with PR intervals of 0.3 s suggestive of 1st degree heart block,
suggesting both sinus node and AV node dysfunction.  She
continued to endorse nausea.  Her blood pressures were stable in
the low 100s.  She was mentating well; however her electrolytes
revealed an acidosis.  Venous blood gas showed a pH of 7.15 with
a bicarb of 14; anion gap of 19.  Lactate was 6.7.  Blood sugar
was 450.  No urine output was available for determination of
ketones.  WBC count was noted to be near 14 with no bands.
Given persistent bradycardia, a right IJ was placed and a
dopamine infusion was initiated with improvement in her heart
rates.  She was admitted to the MICU for hypoperfusion in the
setting of bradycardia with concern for cardiogenic hypotension
or evolving sepsis.  At time of transfer, she was complaining of
palpitations however her vitals were essentially unchanged.
.
Of note, in [**2192-7-26**] she was admitted for cardiogenic
presyncope secondary to bradycardia in the setting of diltiazem
at high doses (240 mg daily).  During this hospitalization she
also had chest pressure which resolved with treatment of
esophageal reflux.  She was discharged on a lower dose of
diltiazem.  However, on a follow up appointment in [**Month (only) 1096**]
[**2191**], she met with her nephrologist Dr [**First Name (STitle) 10083**] who recommended
increasing diltiazem back to 300 mg given severe proteinuria.
She did meet with her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Last Name (STitle) 9006**], in [**Month (only) 404**] to see if this
increase again dropped her heart rate - but on this meeting in
[**Month (only) 404**], her HR tolerated the increased diltiazem dose.  Also of
note, her renal function has been slowly deteriorating over the
past several years from a baseline of 1.3 to a new baseline of
2.1, felt to be secondary to diabetic nephropathy.


Past Medical History:

Social History:
Lives by herself, able to achieve most ADLs.  Her daughter comes
periodically to assist.  No visiting nurse.  She denies smoking

retired.  She speaks Mandarin, Cantonese, and some English.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
.
CXR Portable [**1-6**]:
IMPRESSION: Mild upper zone redistribution of pulmonary
vascularity
suggesting pulmonary venous hypertension, mild cardiomegaly, and
slight
bibasilar atelectasis suspected, but no evidence for pneumonia.
.
CT Head non-con [**1-6**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
.
CT Abd/Pelv [**1-6**]:
IMPRESSION:
1. Right lower lobe consolidation likely due to pneumonia.
2. Cholelithiasis and sludge/bile within the gallbladder. No
evidence of
cholecystitis.
3. Colonic diverticulosis.
4. Atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta.
5. No evidence of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
.
TTE [**2193-1-7**]:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is at
least 15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Pulmonary
artery hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2192-8-16**],
the estimated PA systolic pressure is higher.
.
CXR PA/LAT [**1-8**]:
IMPRESSION: PA and lateral chest compared to [**1-6**]:
.
Previous mild pulmonary edema has cleared, pulmonary and
mediastinal vascular engorgement have cleared, but small
bilateral pleural effusions, reflecting previous cardiac
decompensation, have increased. Heart size top normal. Right
jugular line ends in the mid SVC.
