Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Amiodarone / Lisinopril / Levaquin / Digoxin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea x3 days

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**Company 1543**] Dual ch pacemaker in Left cephalic vein
S/p Cardiac catheterization with Balloon angioplasty to mid Left
anterior descending artery.


History of Present Illness:
66 y/o female with a history of moderate AS, AF, Hodgkins
disease s/p radiation in [**2112**], chronic pericarditis, mitral
valve prolapse  presented to the ED with dyspnea and epigastric
pain.  The patient reports one week of worsening epigastric
pain, cough productive of clear sputum (no purulence, she denies
that this is PNA).  The patient then reported worsening
shortness of breath last night when lying flat.  The patient sat
upright and the symptoms improved.  The patient reports she was
taken off of lasix in the last few months for unclear reasons.
The patient initially presented to [**Hospital3 **] where she
was found to be in AFib with HR to the 170s and was given
Adenosine x 1. She was then given metoprolol x 2 and started on
diltiazem drip. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial VS were HR 105 BP 126/74 RR 28 O2 99.  She
was transferred on 5mg of diltiazem gtt.  Within on hour of
arrival, the patient's blood pressure dropped to 78 systolic.
She received a 500cc bolus of NS.  CXR showed questionable
infiltrate.  Labs were significant for Trop of 0.04, WBC of 8.6.
 She received ceftriaxone and azithromycin for suspected
pneumonia.  As the patient was complaining of epigastric pain,
an abdominal CT was performed which ruled out aortic pathology.
Cardiology was consulted who recommended cardioversion.  The
patient is s/p DCCV with sinus rhythm and blood pressure in the
110s.
.
On the floor, the patient remained in sinus rhythm, however
became increasingly more tachypneic, using accessory muscles to
breath.  An ABG showed metabolic acidosis with respiratory
compensation.  She was given 20mg IV lasix.  Given the concern
of worsening heart failure, respiratory decompensation, the
patient was transferred to the CCU for further evaluation.
.
The patient currently reports some improvement of dyspnea since
arrival to the floor.  She denies chest pain, persistent
epigastric pain.
.
On ROS, she reports lower extremity edema, orthopnea, PND.  She
denies palpitations, chest pain, presyncope, syncope.


Past Medical History:
CHF (unknown EF, on lasix in past stopped in the last few months
for unclear reasons)
Aortic Stenosis (moderate per Echo in [**2159**])
Mitral Valve Prolapse
Atrial [**Name (NI) 31667**] pt, in late [**2161**] was in a study of
Coumadin vs study drug, but she was stopped bc she was bleeding,
however doesn't know from where, only that she's now taking iron
pills for this
chronic pericarditis--per pt is from radiation for Hodgkin's and
has been getting echo's every several months to watch for fluid
accumulation
Coronary vasospasm
hypercholesterolemia
Hypertension
.
OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
thyroid goiter
Hodgkin's dz s/p mediastinal radiation in [**2112**]'s
Syringomyelia
Post Polio syndrome
Splenectomy


Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use. There is no histThere is no family history of premature
coronary artery disease or sudden death. Pt works as massage
therapist, although is disabled because of her heart condition.


Family History:
Mother died from breast CA at 81, father from emphysema in
70'sory of alcohol abuse.

Physical Exam:
VS: BP=119/60  HR=87  RR=30   O2 sat=97% on 4L
GENERAL: WDWN in NAD. Oriented x3. Mood, affect appropriate.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. No xanthalesma.

NECK: Supple with elevated JVP to above her ear with prominently
distended external jugular as well
CARDIAC: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular
line. RR, [**2-12**] early peaking crescendo decrescendo murmur at
RUSB, no r/g. No thrills, lifts. No S3 or S4.
LUNGS:  Using accessory muscles to breathe, expiratory wheezes
bilaterally, bilaterally decreased breath sounds at the bases
and crackles just above the bases
ABDOMEN: Soft, NTND. No HSM or tenderness. Abd aorta not
enlarged by palpation. No abdominial bruits.
EXTREMITIES: 1+ non-pitting edemia, No c/c. No femoral bruits.
SKIN: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
PULSES:
Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 1+ PT 1+
Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ Popliteal 2+ DP 1+ PT 1+

Pertinent Results:
CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. Normal caliber aorta. Assessment for dissection is not
possible and MRI
should be considered for further evaluation. There is no
retroperitoneal or periaortic hematoma.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, pericardial effusion, mesenteric
stranding
with small amount of free fluid in the pelvis, compatible with
volume
overload/cardiac decompensation.
3. Nodular opacity at the right lung base may represent
infection,
aspiration, or atelectasis. Clinical correlation recommended.
4. Complex cystic structure at the upper pole of the left
kidney, which
should be further evaluated with ultrasound nonemergently.
Additional small contour abnormality of the right kidney is also
noted, possibly an additional cyst.
5. Status post cholecystectomy.

Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2163-5-7**] at 2:01:10 PM
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Mild to
moderate ([**12-11**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve
chordae. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
small pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2160-3-11**], the
severity of aortic stenosis has increased and the pleural
effusion is new. Unable to completely assess left ventricular
regional systolic function due to limited images, but overall
function seems to be preserved.
