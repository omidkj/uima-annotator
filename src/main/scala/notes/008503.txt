Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension and poor UOP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
S/p lead extraction and upgrade to biventricular ICD


History of Present Illness:
Briefly, this is a 71 M with a history of CAD s/p CABG in [**2094**]
complicated by VT in the early recovery period and systolic
heart failure (EF ~10%), s/p ICD and pacemaker placement who
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] for elective upgrade to a single BIV-ICD
system.  He underwent this procedure on [**2114-5-31**] which was
complicated by bleeding at line insertion site in neck (hematoma
at site). Otherwise he tolerated the procedure well. He was
originally planned to be D/C'd home, but was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 1516**] service after becoming hypotensive with systolics in the
60s. He received a 250-cc bolus with NS with some improvement
(SBP in 80s-90s). However, he has made very little UOP over the
next day (Foley was removed at ~6:00 AM and there was no further
UOP recorded). In addition, creatinine has increased from 1.3 to
1.9. A bedside echo was performed by the cardiology fellow to
rule out effusion or tamponade (none present). Given
persistently low BPs and possible need for vasopressors to
maintain UOP, he is being transferred to the CCU.
.
Of note, he underwent placement of a Ventack P ICD in [**2094**] with
2 epicardial sensing leads and 2 epicardial patches. This was
changed to a Ventak mini- generator in [**2104**] with placement of an
SVC coil. The SVC coil by CXR on [**2114-5-1**] is noted to be in the
right atrium as opposed to the SVC. He has not received any
therapies from his ICD in 20 years according to Dr.[**Name (NI) 1565**]
note dated [**2114-5-1**]. In [**2106**], the patient subsequently had a St.
[**Male First Name (un) 1525**] pacemaker placed in the right subclavian system. He was
seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] who recommended left-sided biventricular
ICD with extraction of the leads done under general anaethesia
in the OR.
.
On review of systems, he endorses right wrist pain since his
sprain with limited range of motion. Also has chest wall
tenderness since his procedure. He had a recent syncopal episode
after rising to get out of bed in [**Month (only) 958**]. No recent
lightheadedness. He denies any prior history of stroke, TIA,
deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time
of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. No dysuria. All of
the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations.  He does sleep with two pillows at
home but states this is to prevent neck discomfort.
.
On arrival to the ICU, he reports that his thinking is clear.
Denies lightheadedness. Denies pain other than with palpation of
chest wall. No current SOB or other complaints.

IMAGING/STUDIES
ECHO ([**2114-5-31**])
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. There is an inferobasal left ventricular
aneurysm. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 10 %). with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There
are three aortic valve leaflets. There are filamentous strands
on the aortic leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences
(normal variant, but other etieologies can not be excluded owing
to some thickening of strands and poor visibility). The study is
inadequate to exclude significant aortic valve stenosis. Mild to
moderate ([**11-26**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion. Key findings
discussed with procedural team at the time of the exam.

ECHO ([**2114-6-1**])
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF <20%).
Right ventricular cavity size is normal with mild free wall
hypokinesis. Mild to moderate ([**11-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

CXR ([**2114-6-1**])
A single lead follow a normal course from a left-sided battery
pack
terminating in the region of the right ventricle. An abandoned
lead
terminating in the region of the right atrium is ligated in the
chest wall
adjacent to the new battery pack. Epicardial pacing wires are
unchanged.
There is probable small left pleural effusion. There is no
pneumothorax.
Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.
