Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female who initially presented to ED with worsening
chest pain and shortness of breath for 10 to 14 days.  In the ED
the patient was found to be hypotensive with BP of 77/36 and
subsequently went into witnessed arrest. ECG was performed in
the ED which initially showed NSR, RBBB with left axis deviation
with ST elevations in v1, v2 with lateral ST depression. The
patient was given ASA and the ECG progressed to vtach at which
point lidocaine and amiodarone was loaded. The patient went into
asystole after the lidocaine was given and the patient received
atropine and was intubated. The patient subsequently developed
junctional rhythm and return to NSR with LBBB and AV
prolongation. A bedside TTE was performed which demonstrated an
EF of 10% with severe global hypokinesis. 1st set of CE were as
follows: CK: 179, MB: 12, MBI: 6.7. The patient was transferred
to the CCU for further management.

Physical Exam:
The patient was unresponsive and found to be breathless,

reflexes.  The patient was pronounced dead at 1735 on [**2154-4-12**].
The patient's physician and family were notified.  They refused
anatomic gifts and autopsy.

Echocardiogram
The left atrium is dilated. The left ventricular cavity is
mildly dilated with severe global hypokinesis. No masses or
thrombi are seen in the left
ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with mild
global free wall hypokinesis (?apical dysfunction more
prominent?). The aortic leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
CXR
Congestive heart failure.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with hypertension, cerebrovascular disease,
and peripheral vascular disease who presented after 10-14 days
of progressive chest pain and shortness of breath with witnessed
cardiac arrest in ED resulting in cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
She presented intubated and unconscious off sedation to the
cardiac care unit. The patient was started on dopamine infusion
for inotropic pressure support in the ED but had reached maximum
dose available. She was switched to levophed and dobutamine for
better blood pressure control assessed by a peripheral arterial
line that was placed in the CCU. Beta blockade was held for
hypotension.  She received aspirin and was started on
intravenous heparin. She had been given amiodarone and lidocaine
for her arrhythmia, which were discontinued.  By echocardiogram,
her LVEF was 10%, suggesting she had experienced significant
cardiac dysfunction. Additionally, her CK and troponin T
continued to climb, indicating large scale, ongoing cardiac
damage. On telemetry, the patient exhibited various conduction
blockade, including eposodic Weinkebach grouped beating.
.
The patient likely developed anoxic brain damage due to
signficant cardiac arrest in the setting of baseline
cerebrovascular disease. She was at presentation nonresponsive
without any sedation with decorticate posturing to painful
stimuli without evidence of normal withdrawal response. Babinski
sign was postive bilaterally but more pronounced on the left.
Pupils were fixed and dilated. She had ittle spontaneous limb
movement and poor peripheral capillary refill.
.
She became febrile to >105 rectally during her [**Last Name (un) 102218**] CCU
course. Blood cultures were obtained and results were pending at
time of death.  The patient's sister, [**Name (NI) 13118**], and several other
family members were present at the time of death. They had opted
on the telephone earlier in the day to apply DNR/DNI status per
the patient's wishes expressed to multiple family members. The
patient was kept intubated on pressors until the family made the
decision to withdraw aggressive care, pursuing comfort measures
only instead. The patient was successfully extubated without
complication and the IV infusions were discontinued. IV morphine
was given for comfort without overly reducing respiratory rate.
The patient expired within an hour later with family present and
last rites were obtained.
