Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 165**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2157-3-8**] Off-pump coronary artery bypass graft x3:  Left internal
mammary artery to left anterior descending artery and saphenous
vein grafts to diagonal and posterior descending arteries

History of Present Illness:
61 year old male with history of Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia,
and known 3 vessel CAD who presents with chest pain. Patient
states that on [**1-13**] he was in [**Country 6505**] visiting his brother when
he developed SSCP associated with diaphoresis. Went to the
hospital and was found to have an NSTEMI. Cardiac
catheterization revealed three vessel CAD with mild LV systolic
dysfunction (LAD 70% ostial stenosis, RCA Mid 90% stenosis, OM
70% proximal lesion). Given that the patient had
thrombocytopenia secondary to MDS versus CLL he was not taken
for CABG. Instead he was medically opitmized and returned to
[**Location 86**] for follow up with his cardiologist.
.
After his return the patient saw his cardiologist who performed
and nuclear stress test which showed inducible ischemia with
minmal activity in LAD/RCA distribution. Throughout this time
the patient notes intermittent chest pain. He notes that it is
very difficult to differentiate between chest pain secondary to
GERD versus a cardiac origin. He typically notes worsened chest
pain after eating. Further should he eat and attempt to walk he
will get worsened chest pain and shortness of breath which will
reguire him to stop and rest. Since returning from [**Country 6505**]
patient has used a nitro patch daily with 2-3 SL nitros daily.
In the last two days patient has used more SL nitroglycerin and
has been using nitropatch at night.

COMPARISON: [**2157-3-11**].
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. Minimal decrease in size of the pre-existing left
retrocardiac
atelectasis. Unchanged appearance of the heart, unchanged
radiographic aspect of the post-sternal region. No newly
appeared focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2157-3-8**]  3:15:36 PM
Sinus rhythm. Left atrial abnormality. Consider prior inferior
myocardial
infarction and modest inferolateral lead T wave changes.
Baseline artifact
makes assessment difficult. Since the previous tracing of
[**2157-3-5**] sinus
bradycardia is absent. Otherwise, probably no significant
change.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications.
Conclusions
Pre-procedure:
The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast
or thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 40 %). with mild global free wall hypokinesis.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is
eccentric, directed toward the anterior mitral leaflet. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.
Post-procedure:
The patient never received inotropic support at any point during
the off-CPB CABG. No new wall motion abnormalities were seen at
any point in the procedure. Biventricular systolic function was
preserved and similar to pre-procedure. There is trace mitral
regurgitation post-procedure. All other findings are consistent
with pre-procedure findings. The aorta is intact post partial
clamping for proximal vein graft anastamos
