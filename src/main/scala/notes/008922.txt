History of Present Illness:
This is a 69 year old male who has been on Coumadin for a
history of multiple DVTs and a PE. He had complained of a
headache for several days and had multiple episodes of vomiting.
His son found him confused after family members reported a
stuporous "drunken" state. He was brought to the OSH. He
reportedly wasmoving all extremities and was able to answer some
questions.
His head CT revealed a large left SDH. He was given 10 mg SC of
vitamin K and FFP as well as a dilantin load. He was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for a neurosurgical evaluation.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he was still moving spontaneously
but unable to answer questions per the ER. He was given
profiline
and a second dose of FFP.

Pertinent Results:
CT Head [**2142-2-13**]:
Left subdural hematoma with a hyperdense focus in the left
frontoparietal
region consistent with acute hemorrhage. 1.4 cm rightward
subfalcine
herniation and compression of the left lateral ventricle without
ventricular entrapment. Overall, unchanged since outside
hospital study performed two hours ago.

CT Head [**2142-2-14**]:
Newly apparent 5-mm in transverse dimension posteriorly centered

right subdural hemorrhage. The patient is status post left
craniotomy with
interval evacuation of previously noted left subdural
hemorrhage. Improvement in mass effect with now 4 mm rightward
midline shift decreased from 9 using comparable measurements.
Improvement in compression of the left lateral ventricle.

LENIS [**2142-2-15**]:
1. Incomplete compressibility of the left mid-to-lower
superficial femoral
vein which may represent partially occlusive or chronic DVT.
2. No evidence of right lower extremity DVT.

CT Head [**2142-2-19**]:
Stable CT scan


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1794**] was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] under the CAre of Dr [**First Name (STitle) **]. He
was taken to the OR on the evening of [**2142-2-13**] for Left craniotomy
for SDH evacuation. He was left intubated and transported to the
ICU. He was extubated aorund noon on [**2142-2-14**]. He was MAE with
right sided weakness but not following commands. HE became
febrile to 101.8 early am on [**2142-2-15**]. Sputum cultures were
positive for Gram + cocci in pairs. LENS showed a Left
superficial femoral DVT that was either chronic or a new
partially occlusive DVT. His PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].[**Last Name (STitle) 1057**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] at his
new office [**Telephone/Fax (1) 14331**]. His office had records dating from
[**2139**]. The patient has been on Coumdain since then without a new
diagnosis of DVT. Therefore we determined that his origical DVT
was prior to [**2139**] and this finding was consistant with new L
DVT. Venodynes were removed form the LLE. Hematology was
consulted with regards to whether anticoagulation is warranted.
In the context of a recent evacuation of the SDH and the small
size of the DVT, it was felt that the patient can be initiated
on subcutaneous heparin at prophylactic dose since the patient
has an IVC filter in place.  The joint decision between
neurosurgery and hematology was to initiate anti-coagulation
approxiamtely 2 weeks after the SDH evacuation. He was seen by
the Speach/Swallow service. They recommended a pureed diet.

His neruologic status was improved on 2.4 and transfer to the
SDU was initiated. On [**2142-2-16**] he was neurologically stable in the
SDU. Levofloxacin was started in the setting of low grade fever
and sputum with gram + cocci. CT head showed a L PCA infarct.
Stroke Neurology was consulted. Work up revealed no evidence of
embolic or thrombotic lesions.  The patient will f/u with the
neurology clinic for work up of hypercoagulability.

Also on [**2142-2-16**], his foley was discontiued for a voiding trial.
His bowel regimen was increased. PT and OT were consulted. KUB
showed a decrease in air in small bowel and repeat head CT was
stable.

Pt was cleared to go to rehab on [**2142-2-19**]
