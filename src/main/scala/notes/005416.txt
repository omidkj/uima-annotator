HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 69-year-old woman was
admitted to the medical intensive care unit on [**2121-6-20**]
with lethargy and fever.  She was discharged from the
hospital on [**2121-6-16**] after an admission for management of
a loculated pleural effusion.  During this admission she
received a VATS procedure with results suggestive of a
postinflammatory pleural effusion.  She was discharged home
and felt well until [**6-20**].  On this day she had increased
lethargy, sleepiness and tremors.  A home health aid noted
these symptoms and the patient was transported to the
Emergency Department.  Her fasting sugar was 73 and she was
given one ampicillin of D50.  She woke up slightly but was
still somnolent.  Her initial vital signs were blood pressure
114/46, heart rate 88 and temperature 97.0.  She was
maintaining an oxygen saturation of 100% on room air.  She
had a urinalysis which was suggestive of a urinary tract
infection and her creatinine had increased from a prior level
of 0.9 to 1.9.  Then, her systolic blood pressure decreased
into the 70s and her heart rate increased to between 100 and
110.  The intensive care unit was called to evaluate the
patient for possible urosepsis.  She subsequently developed a
fever of 102.3.

The patient denies recent fever, chills, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal or chest pain.  She has chronic wheezing.  She also
has a history of dietary indiscretion and weight gain
exacerbating her diastolic heart failure.

In the Emergency Department the patient received three liters
of normal saline, levofloxacin, metronidazole, and Kayexalate
for a potassium of 5.7.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Diastolic dysfunction causing class
3 heart failure, chronic atrial fibrillation, status post
prior treatment with dofetilide (discontinued because of
increased QT interval and diastolic dysfunction), amiodarone,

PCI, status post most recent catheterization in [**2121-3-8**].  3. Hypertension.  4. Hypercholesterolemia.  5. Type 2
diabetes mellitus requiring insulin.  6. Chronic stasis

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 100.0, heart rate 90,
blood pressure 84/49, respiratory rate 16, oxygen saturation
100% on four liters.  General:  Pleasant elderly woman in no
acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light, extraocular motility intact.  Oropharynx
dry.  Neck:  Normal jugular venous pressure.  Lungs:  Diffuse
wheezes and bibasilar crackles.  Chest:  Pressure dressing
over the right thoracotomy site with slight drainage, no
tenderness.  Heart:  Irregularly irregular rhythm, mildly
tachycardic, no murmurs.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended, normal active bowel sounds.  Extremities:
Right leg with a large 4 x 10 inch area of erythema,
ulceration, with mild drainage.  Neurologic:  Awake, alert,
conversant, mentating, moving all four extremities
spontaneously, sensation intact to light touch in bilateral

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 11.0, hematocrit
29.9, platelet count 354, sodium 129, potassium 5.7, chloride
87, bicarbonate 33, BUN 39, creatinine 1.9, glucose 207, INR

[**12-25**] white cells and few bacteria.

EKG:  Atrial fibrillation at 106 beats per minute, no ST and
T wave changes.

Chest x-ray:  Persistent left pleural effusion, mild
congestive heart failure, possible retrocardiac density.

CT of head:  Negative for intracranial hemorrhage or edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1. Infectious disease:  The patient was
initially admitted to the medical intensive care unit and
treated under a presumptive diagnosis of urosepsis.  Other
infectious etiologies considered included pneumonia and
lower extremity cellulitis, but none were proven.  After
her initial temperature spike the patient did not have any
further fevers.  She received IV fluids for her hypotension
with increases in her systolic blood pressure to the 90s and
low 100s.  She initially received dexamethasone until a
cortisol level returned at 31, suggesting that the patient
did not have adrenal insufficiency.  The patient received a
total 10-day course of levofloxacin for her possible
infection.  Of note, her blood and urine cultures from the
early portion of her admission did not grow any organisms.

2. Cardiovascular:  The patient's cardiac issues include
severe diastolic dysfunction and chronic atrial fibrillation.
Her most recent echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular
ejection fraction of greater than 75% and a dilated left
atrium.  At baseline, her systolic blood pressure runs in the
90s.  She maintains mentation and organ perfusion at
this systolic blood pressure.  After the fluid resuscitation
that the patient initially received for her presumed sepsis,
the patient had an increased oxygen requirement of three to
four liters and extensive third spacing of fluids in the
peripheral tissues.  She was transferred to the floor on [**6-24**].  She was persistently tachycardic and hypotensive, which
limited the ability to diurese or to control her heart rate with
medications.  She was initially
placed on a furosemide drip and diuresed a total of
approximately eight liters.  The Heart Failure Service was
consulted, and she was thereafter
transferred to the cardiac floor and placed on a nesiritide
drip with further diuresis.  She was symptomatically improved
with decreased shortness of breath, decreased oxygen
requirement, and decreased peripheral edema after this
diuresis.  Her blood pressure improved with diuresis and
resolution of tachycardia, presumably related to improved pump
function and filling.

After transfer to the floor the patient's metoprolol dose was
changed to 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.  Her rate continued to exist
mostly between 100 and 120 with periods of elevation into the
120s.  Her dose was subsequently increased to 75 mg p.o.
t.i.d. with instructions to give 25 mg if her systolic blood
pressure was under 90.  This resulted in improved heart rate
control with heart rate mostly between 90 and 100.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
of the heart failure service, and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] of
electrophysiology were involved in the patient's care.  On
their recommendations, flecainide was initiated for her
atrial fibrillation.

The patient continued to be anticoagulated as well for her
atrial fibrillation.  As aforementioned, her INR on admission
was subtherapeutic.  She was placed on 2.5 mg of Coumadin per
day and her INR became supratherapeutic at a peak level of
4.1 on [**6-26**].  Several doses were held and her INR decreased
to a level of 2.6 on [**6-28**].  Thereafter the warfarin was
continued but flecanaide was discontinued with expection that
this would be initiated in about one month  for elective
chemical cardioversion.

3. Neurological:  The patient has a painful peripheral
sensory neuropathy.  Initially her analgesic medications were
held because of hypotension.  After her blood pressure
improved, her regimen of gabapentin 300 mg t.i.d., fentanyl
25 mcg patch, MSIR 15 mg b.i.d. was reinitiated.
