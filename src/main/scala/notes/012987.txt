previous post-surgical DVTs who presented from her [**Hospital 4382**] facility with sudden onset of right-sided chest and back
pain at 11:45 am while she was lying in bed. Patient described
the pain as quite pleuritic, "not really dull or not really
sharp". She denied any palpitations, SOB, or LH, or loss of
consciousness. Denies nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis. Has never
had this type of chest pain before. Denies any lower extremity
edema. Has chronic pain in her L knee since her replacement in
[**3-10**], but no tenderness or pain above baseline over past 24 hrs.
Patient recently suffered a fall 2 weeks ago, and has been
immobilized, stating that she should be doing PT, but has not
been up and about as often as she should be. Denies any trauma
to her legs during that fall or recently. Denies any recent
travel history on planes or cars, any abnormal bleeding or
clotting abnormalities, or use of oral contraceptives or hormone
replacement therapy. Patient has no history of cancer, but
reports she has not had a mammogram recently and her last
colonoscopy was approximately 8-9 years ago. Pain was
unrelenting, so patient told the resident physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] her
symptoms, which resulted in the EMS call and her ED admission.
.
She was given 324 mg aspirin en route to the ED. In the ED, she
was febrile to 100.5. EKG showed old RBBB and LAFB. CXR showed
left-sided atelectasis, no focal consolidation. While in the ED,
she complained of severe mid-back pain and CTA chest was
performed, which showed "Wet Read: Saddle PE with emboli
extending into most lobes, with large thrombi within the RUL,
RLL and lingular arteries." She was guaiac negative. She was
started on heparin gtt and given levofloxacin, potassium
repletion, morphine 14 mg.
.
In the ICU, EKG was performed which showed old RBBB, no acute
ischemic changes. One set of cardiac enzmyes were neg (CK 2,
Trop-T < 0.01). Oxygen saturations were noted to be in the high
90's on 3LNC. She had no tachycardia and her SBPs were stable in
the 100-150. Heparin gtt was continued and her home
anti-hypertensives were held overnight for fear of hemodynamic
instability. Her fever and WBC resolved while in the ICU and she
was called out to the floor this AM.
