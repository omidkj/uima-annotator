HOSPITAL COURSE:  1)  Infectious disease.  Patient with MRSA
sepsis and Candidemia.  Patient became septic on [**8-22**] with
fever, hypotension and blood culture which was positive for
MRSA.  Patient was started on Vancomycin for a full 20 day
course.  His Medical Intensive Care Unit course was also
complicated by Candidemia treated with intravenous
fluconazole times 11 days. He was then finished on his course
with p.o. Fluconazole for a total of 28days.  Patient will be
discharged home with oral fluconazole to finish out his
course for a total of 28 days.

2) Renal.  Patient with end stage renal  disease on
hemodialysis.  Patient presented with uremia and initiated
hemodialysis. He had a Permacath placed for permanent
hemodialysis access. He will continue on PhosLo and Epogen.
He is followed by the renal team.

3)  Pulmonary.  Patient with respiratory distress on [**2155-8-22**]
with saturations in the 70s on nonrebreather mask. He was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit and intubated.
He was extubated on the 7th and put on  CPAP but underwent a
bronchoscopy to look for mucous plugs. On [**8-31**] he was then
reintubated and subsequently extubated on [**9-5**].  He has
remained stable respiratory-wide on the floor and he has a
history of obstructive sleep apnea.  He has been continued on
BiPAP on the floor.

4)  Gastrointestinal.  Alcoholic cirrhosis with diarrhea.
Patient with history of encephalopathy, continued on
lactulose.  He has had no hepatic synthetic dysfunction this
admission. His lactulose was held on [**9-13**] for some ongoing
diarrhea.  His mental status remained clear on he floor.  He
was continued on a proton pump inhibitor and the
gastrointestinal team was consulted on the 23rd for work up
of his diarrhea.  His work up including stool culture and C.
difficile remained negative except that his diarrhea improved
on a lactose free diet.  Patient is to have a lactose
hydrogen breath test as an outpatient and can follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9135**] [**Name (STitle) **] for this test.

5)  Endocrine.  Type 2 diabetes.  Patient was poorly
controlled. Blood sugars on sliding scale insulin when he was
transferred to the floor. We consulted the [**Hospital1 **] Diabetes
service and he was started on sliding scale insulin and
nighttime Lanta with some improvement of his blood sugars.
Patient will be maintained on the current regimen.

6) Dermatology.  Patient presented initially with
maculopapular painful rash on all of his extremities on sun
exposed areas.  Dermatology was consulted and felt this was a
photo sensitivity reaction while on hydrochlorothiazide.  The
patient was treated with topical steroids and his
hydrochlorothiazide was held.  His rash is much improved
today.

7)  Hematology.  [**Hospital **] Medical Intensive Care Unit course
is complicated with  diffuse intervascular coagulation and
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.  He had elevated PT and PTT
and thrombocytopenia thought secondary to diffuse
intervascular coagulation from sepsis in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  He gradually improved with supportive
therapy and normalized his coagulations on the floor.
Patient also had thrombocytopenia thought secondary to
heparin in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  His heparin was
discontinued and his platelets remained borderline low but
improved to the low 100s. His platelets again began to drop
on [**9-13**] to [**9-14**] and his cimetidine was changed to Protonix as
cimetidine with known adverse hematologic effects.

8)  Prophylaxis.  Patient was maintained on a proton pump
inhibitor and Venodynes.

9)  Code status.  Patient is full code.
