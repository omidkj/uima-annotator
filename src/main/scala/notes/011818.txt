HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 64-year-old white
woman with past medical history significant for pulmonary
embolus in [**2192-4-21**] treated with Coumadin until [**2192-10-21**], who presents to [**Hospital1 69**]
after being diagnosed with a massive pulmonary embolus at an
outside hospital, at [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital.  The patient was
started on TPA over two hours and then was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**].

At the outside hospital, the patient was diagnosed with
pulmonary embolus on a CT angiogram.  Patient has been
experiencing 10 days of intermittent dyspnea on exertion.
She first noticed symptoms while in the supermarket standing.
Over the last week, she has felt dyspnea on exertion multiple
times.  She also notes while getting dressed in the morning.

On the day prior to admission, patient noticed that while
walking from the parking lot to a baseball game, she had to
stop several times because of dyspnea on exertion.  On the
night prior to admission, the patient noticed when she was
getting short of breath while walking to the bathroom.

She denies chest pain, palpitations, cough, fever, or loss of
consciousness.  She denies long period of stationary activity
including plane flights or car rides.  She does report left
popliteal pain.  She notes that this is the same leg as her
old deep venous thrombosis in [**2192-4-21**], which have
occurred in the context of a long plane flight.  She denies
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, lower extremity
swelling, exertional angina.  She also denies bright red
blood per rectum, melena with a negative colonoscopy in [**2193-2-19**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs on admission to the [**Hospital1 1444**]:  Heart rate 82, blood
pressure 140/47, oxygen saturation 99% on nonrebreather.
General:  In no apparent distress on a nonrebreather.  She
was sitting up, talking in full sentences.  HEENT:
Extraocular movements are intact.  Pupils are equal, round,
and reactive to light and accommodation.  Oropharynx was
clear.  Moist mucous membranes.  Neck:  Elevated jugular
venous pressure appreciated to the ear.  Chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac:  Regular, rate, and
rhythm with distant heart sounds, but no murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.  Abdomen is obese, no organomegaly, and normoactive
bowel sounds.  Is soft and nontender.  Extremities:  No
cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  No systemic swelling.
Neurologic:  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 14.1, hematocrit
35.8, platelets 211, neutrophils 96.4, lymphocytes 18.7,
monocytes 3, eosinophils 1.6.  Sodium 138, potassium 4.4,
chloride 107, bicarbonate 19, BUN 29, creatinine 1.0, glucose
141, PTT 57.4, INR 2.6, calcium 9.7, alkaline phosphatase
4.7, magnesium 1.6.  CK of 49, troponin is negative.

CT scan was done at an outside hospital which showed
pulmonary embolus.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:  For this 64-year-old female with
massive pulmonary embolus, she had thrombolytic therapy at an
outside hospital, and transferred to [**Hospital1 190**] for further care.  She was hemodynamically
stable throughout her hospital course at [**Hospital1 346**].

1. Pulmonary:  Patient had a massive pulmonary embolus, which
was treated with thrombolytics.  She was then transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**], where she was started
on Heparin once her PTT was less than two times normal.  She
had an echocardiogram done during her admission, which showed
an ejection fraction of 60%, had normal left atrium and right
atrium, trivial mitral regurgitation and tricuspid
regurgitation.  The right ventricle was noted to be mildly
dilated.  The right ventricular systolic function was thought
to be depressed.  Her pulmonary embolus was found to be
bilaterally in the pulmonary arteries.

She was transferred out of the Medical Intensive Care Unit on
the second day of her admission at the [**Hospital1 190**].  Because she remained hemodynamically stable,
she did not require any further thrombolytics.  She was
considered for vena caval filter considering the extent of
her pulmonary embolus.  However, since she had not failed
anticoagulation therapy, IVC filter was deferred at this
time.

She had lower extremity noninvasive ultrasounds done to
assess her deep venous thrombosis.  She had a small deep
venous thrombosis in the left popliteal region.
Hypercoagulability workup was sent in this patient, unclear
reason for developing massive pulmonary embolus.  She had a
protein-C and protein-S sent along with homocysteine.  Her
homocysteine returned within normal limits.

She was started on warfarin on the third day of her
admission.  She was then switched over to Lovenox assuming
that she was hemodynamically stable throughout this entire
admission and would also be continued on warfarin.  The
Lovenox will be continued until her INR was therapeutic.
Patient was able to ambulate without difficulty or dizziness.
Her INR at discharge was 1.3.

She had a repeat lower extremity noninvasive Doppler on day
of discharge.  It did not show any propagation of the
popliteal DVT.

During the course of the admission, patient's home
medications were continued.  She was restarted on her
antihypertensives and also on her diabetic medications.

Patient was to be discharged on Lovenox and warfarin with
close monitoring of her INR as an outpatient.  She would be
discharged to home.  She will follow up with her primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16004**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Lovenox 100 mg subcutaneously administered b.i.d. until
INR greater than 2.
2. Coumadin 7.5 mg p.o. for two days and then 5 mg p.o.
3. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Metformin 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6. Cozaar 50 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Glipizide 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.

10. Vioxx 25 mg p.o. q.d.
11. Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
