Demerol

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain; admission from OSH with STEMI for cath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2119-3-8**]: Cardiac catheterization, placement of drug eluting
stent
[**2119-3-9**]: Cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57-yr-old male with a h/o CAD s/p CABG on [**2119-2-11**]
who awoke this morning with chest pain, [**2122-8-3**], radiating down
his left arm, associated with shortness of breath and nausea. It
was substantially worse than the chest pain that initiated his
previous hospitalization. Presented to OSH ED with 8/[**Street Address(2) 72530**] elevations in II, III, and aVF (with ST depressions and T
wave inversions in aVL, V1-V6). He was immediately transferred
via LifeFlight to our cath lab. En route, received 2 ASA 81 mg
and NTG sl x1 in ED, along with Lopressor 5 mg IV, Heparin 4000
Unit bolus, Plavix 600 mg, Nitro at 40 mcg, with continued chest
pain.
.
In the cath lab, angiography demonstrated a complete thrombosed
SVG-PDA graft. Thrombectomy was successful, and resolution of
the thrombus revealed an 80% "ostial" lesion at the antegrade
limb of the PDA at its touchdown and a critical 90% lesion in
the retrograde limb. Final angiogram showed TIMI III flow with
no residual stenosis, no dissection, no perforation, and no
embolization. Post cath transferred to [**Hospital1 **] service chest pain
free in stable condition.
.
O/N developed [**Hospital **] transfered to cath lab forund to have thrombose
SVG-PDA including stent. Thrombectomy unsuccesful. PTCA RCA c/b
dissection for which 2 MiniVision stents placed. Tx'd to CCU for
further management


Past Medical History:
- CAD s/p CABG [**1-/2119**] (5 vessel: LIMA->LAD, Y SVG->OM1&2,
SVG->OM3, SVG->PDA)
- Neurofibromatosis (+ family history)
- COPD
- History of spontaneous pneumothorax
- S/P appendectomy
.
Cardiac History: CABG, [**2119-2-15**], anatomy as follows: LIMA to LAD,
SVG to OM1, SVG to OM2/OM3, SVG to RCA.


Social History:
Social history is significant for the absence of current tobacco
use (although has a history of ~40pack-years, quit last month).
There is no history of alcohol abuse (drinks ~6 drinks per
weekend). He lives with his wife and works at an aluminum
factory as a receiver. He has smoked one pack per day for forty
years and drinks approximately six beers each weekend.

Family History:
There is no family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death. He has a strong history of NF in his mother,
two brothers and 2 sisters, all deceased from complications of
their NF. No history of thyroid or parathyroid disease. No
history of MI or heart disease.

Physical Exam:
Blood pressure was 135/64 mm Hg while seated. Pulse was 68
beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min, with
O2 sat 98% on room air. Generally the patient was thin and
disheveled appearing, with poor dentition. His skin exam is
remarkable for diffuse neurofibromas. The patient was oriented
to person, place and time. The patient's mood and affect were
somewhat flattened.
.
There was no xanthalesma and conjunctiva were pink with no
pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. The neck was supple with
JVP of 5 cm. The carotid waveform was normal. There was no
thyromegaly. The were no chest wall deformities, scoliosis or
kyphosis. He has a healing midline sternotomy incision, without
erythema or purulent discharge. The respirations were not
labored and there were no use of accessory muscles. The lungs
were clear to ascultation bilaterally (anteriorly) with normal
breath sounds and no adventitial sounds or rubs.
.
Palpation of the heart revealed the PMI to be located in the 5th
intercostal space, mid clavicular line. There were no thrills,
lifts or palpable S3 or S4. The heart sounds were distant but
revealed a normal S1 and S2. There were no rubs, murmurs, clicks
or gallops.
.
The abdominal aorta was not enlarged by palpation. There was no
hepatosplenomegaly or tenderness. The abdomen was scaphoid,
soft, nontender and nondistended. The extremities had no pallor,
cyanosis, clubbing or edema. There were no abdominal, femoral or
carotid bruits. There is no hematoma in the right groin.
Inspection and palpation of skin and subcutaneous tissue was
remarkable for diffuse neurofibromas. He had no stasis
dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
.
Pulses:
Right: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+
Left: Carotid 2+ Femoral 2+ DP 2+ PT 2+

CARDIAC CATH performed on [**2119-3-8**] demonstrated: 1. Graft
angiography revealed an occluded thrombosed SVG-PDA graft. After
the PDA touchdown, there was an 80% PDA lesion. The SVG-OM1 and
SVG-OM2-OM3
grafts were widely patent. 2. The native coronary vessels were
known to be occluded and diffusely diseased and were not imaged.
The LIMA-LAD was not imaged. 3. Resting hemodynamics revealed a
mildly elevated mean PCPW of 14mmHg and a normal cardiac index
of 2.37 l/min/m2. 4. After thrombectomy, the TD lesion of the
SVG to PDA was directly stented with a 2.5 X 08 mm Cypher stent
with lesion reduction to 0%. The final angiogram showed TIMI III
flow with no residual stenosis, no dissection and no
embolisation.
