Brief Hospital Course:
56-year-old male with a past medical history of atrial
fibrillation, on coumadin, Meckles diverticulum repair with
recurrent SBOs who presents with BRBPR in the setting of an
elevated INR.

# GI bleed: The patient was admitted to the ICU. He recieved 3 [**Location **] for a low hematocrit. His INR was elevated to 6.0 and
it was reversed with vitamin K. The bleeding appeared to stop
and the patient was stable. The patient was started on IV PPI
and had serial Hct drawn. He was stable and felt better and was
transferred to the regular floor. He was prepped and had a
colonoscopy and EGD without further bleeding. There was no
obvious source for the bleed. His hct was watched and he
continued to feel well. The patient was discharged with close
follow up. His cardiologist with contact him in regards to
restarting the coumadin. The patient also needs an outpatient
capsule endoscopy. This will be set up through his GI physician.

# Fever: The patient developed a fever and felt unwell. He had
rigors and was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole. He was
given IVF. He had a chest x-ray which showed a pneumonia. He was
treated with a 5 day course of antibiotics. He felt much better
and was afebrile the following day. He was discharged with close
follow up with his primary care physician.

# Atrial fibrillation: The patient had atrial fibrillation and
was on coumadin for a planned cardioversion. His INR was
elevated and was reversed due to the GI bleed. He was maintained
on a low dose of beta blocker for rate control. When he would
stand up he would become tachycardic to the 150s and thus had
his beta blocker dose increased. He was also given IVF. He was
well rate controlled on an increased dose of metoprolol at
discharge. He may need a cardiac monitor which will be set up by
his cardiologist. His cardiologist will also contact him in
regards to when to restart coumadin. He will likely need
cardioversion in the future.

# Syncope: This was likely in the setting of hypovolemia and
anemia, but may also be due to a tachyarrhythmia. He was
corrected per above. He felt well and have no further episodes
of syncope.

# SOB: The patient was SOB on admission. This was likely
secondary to symptomatic anemia. He was had a normal sat on 2L
NC. He was quickly weaned from oxygen and felt well after
administration of blood products.

# OSA: Continued CPAP per home settings
