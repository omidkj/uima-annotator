EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Left ventricular hypertrophy. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2167-6-3**] the rate has slowed. The
voltage is more prominent in the limb leads. Otherwise, no
diagnostic interim change.


Brief Hospital Course:
81 y/o female with history of obesity, HTN, IDDM, OSA, chronic
respiratory failure ,s/p tracheostomy presents with acute
respiratory failure.
.
1.Respiratory Failure: The respiratory failure was thought to be
due to the mucous plug.  It was unlikely to be aspiration,
atelectasis or pulmonary embolism. There was no evidence of ACS.
 Additionally, diastolic dysfunciton could play a role in the
respiratory symptoms as the patient is wheezing and ECHO from
[**1-14**] shows abnormal E/A ratio. However, BNP 250's. Patient was
continued on O2 via TM and weaned as symptoms improved.  Sp02
goal was around 95%.  Patient was given nebulized
bronchodialators and suctioning prn.  Lasix was given to control
the edema.  Patient was follow by physical therapy and
respiratory therapy who worked with the patient on a daily basis
to improve her conditioning.  Patient was downsized to a 6.0
portex.  She was eventually moved to capping as much as
possible.  The goal is decannulation.  Throughout the admission,
patient adamantly refused outpatient rehab.  Patient was
decannulated [**2167-6-19**] and tolerated the procedure well. She
remained stable and sating well for the rest of the admission.

.
2.Respiratory Acidosis: Patient has respiratory acidosis with
compensatory metabolic alkalosis, pCO2 near baseline. FiO2 was
kept at a level to improve respiratory drive.
.
3. Diabetes:  Blood sugar was found to be elevated at admission,
367.  Likely related to steroids.  Her HbA1C was recorded,
steriods stopped.  Patient was maintained on an ISS and NPH.
She was given a diabetic diet. She was sent home on an insulin
regiment.
.
4.CAD: Patient was continued on aspirin, beta blocker and CCB.
.
5.metabolic alkalosis: Thought to be due to chronic CO2
retention, could also be component of contraction alkalosis.
Respiratory status, bicarb levels, and fluid status were
followed.
.
6.anemia-Patient's baseline is 35-36. Hematocrit was followed.
Normocytic anemia.
.
7.glaucoma-Patient was continued on her outpatient eye drop
