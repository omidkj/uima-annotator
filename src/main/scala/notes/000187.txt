Allergies:

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 633**]
Chief Complaint:
LLQ pain


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of a left ureteral stent


History of Present Illness:
64 yo F w/ PMH of CHF, IDDM, hypothyroidism, ventricular
arrythmia with ICD who is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with GNR
bacteremia s/p cystoscopy and stent placement for
nephrolithiasis with difficulty extubating. Pt presented to the
ED the day prior to transfer with left flank pain, nausea and
vomiting.  KUB and CT abdomen showed 8-mm stone within the
proximal left ureter resulting in mild
hydronephrosis.  When she was in the ED she got a dose of
ceftriaxone and a dose of ampicillin. She was admitted to
urology where they were planning to do an elective stent
placement. However overnight she developed low grade fevers to
100.8 and her blood cultures grew out GNR and her procedure was
moved up to be emergent.  She had a stent placed in her left
ureter, and she received 700ml fluids total in the OR plus 125cc
in the PACU. Post operatively she remained hypotensive (to
unclear BPs) on 0.3 of phenylepherine which was weaned off in
the PACU.  In the PACU when they tried to wean down to extubate,
on CPAP she was only pulling in tidal volumes in the 100s.  She
received Vanc and Cefepime in the PACU.  Blood sugars were
apparently elevated before to unclear levels, got 10u subcu
regular noonish.  Only value recorded is 220s.  Reportedly good
UOP while in PACU.

She is transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for management of her blood
pressure and respiratory status.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS.  99.8 133/69 92 100% on

Social History:
The patient lives with her daughter.  She previously worked as a
social worker. She does not smoke or drink alcohol.  She has
remote cocaine use (quit [**2099**]) and alcohol use, 45 pack year
tobacco hx, quit in [**2099**].

Vitals:  99.8 133/69 92 100% on CMV with TV 500, RR 15, FiO2 40%
General: NAD, appears comfortable, AAOx3
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL

Lungs: Dimished breath sounds at bases bilaterally anteriorly
Abdomen: soft, tender at lower quadrants, maximally on LLQ,
non-distended, no organomegaly, no rebound or guarding.
Hypoactive bowel sounds.
Ext: Trace edema in feet b/l. Warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, no
clubbing, cyanosis


Pertinent Results:
KUB [**2117-10-27**]: IMPRESSION:  8-mm stone within the proximal left
ureter resulting in mild hydronephrosis.

CT abd: IMPRESSION:  7-mm proximal ureteral stone at the level
of the L3 vertebral body; upstream left hydroureteronephrosis
with delayed excretion of contrast in the dilated left
collecting system and proximal ureter. No definite contrast seen
in the left ureter distal to the level of the renal stone.

CXR [**2117-10-28**]: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has been
intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 3 cm above
the carina.  A left pectoral pacemaker is in unchanged position.


In the interval, lung volumes have substantially decreased,
there are signs indicative of mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema
and atelectasis at both lung bases.  No evidence of pneumonia.
Short-term followup with chest radiographs is required.
.
ECHO:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect or patent
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast
with maneuvers. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior and
inferolateral hypokinesis. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The diameters of aorta at
the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2115-11-8**],
the right ventricle appears dilated and hypokinetic and there is
evidence of pressure/volume overload of the left ventricle.
Findings are suggestive of acute right heart strain - probably
from pulmonary embolism although right ventricular ischemia is
also possible.
.
CTA chest:
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2.  Mild pulmonary edema and bilateral atelectasis, right
greater than left.
3.  Incompletely imaged left kidney showing a 6-mm stone and
start of the
double J-stent but also small foci of air in the kidney of
unclear
significance.
