Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Keflex

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30**]
Chief Complaint:
hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
This is a 40 year old man with a history of depression who is
transferred from the [**Hospital3 **] ED with hemoptysis. He
was involved in an altercation on [**2176-11-8**] during which he was
punched in the head and fell down 4 stairs. He fell onto the
right side of his chest against a stone landing. Since that time
he has had severe pain on his right side, particularly with
movement or respirations. He has also had hemoptysis since that
time. He has had persistent pinkish sputum. He also had two
episodes of bright red blood, the first was the day after the
altercations (about 1 tablespoon) and the second on the morning
of admission (about 1 teaspoon). He has also had subjective F/C,
diaphoresis, and decreased PO intake. He denies N/V, abd pain,
diarrhea, constipation, and dysuria. He has tried tylenol,
motrin, Aleve, and percocet (belonging to a friend) for the
pain, but nothing has worked.
.
He initially presented to the [**Hospital1 2436**] ED where CXR showed
dense RLL and RML consolidation and patchy RUL infiltrate. Chest
CT was read as RML and RLL dense consolidations, patchy
infiltrate RUL, plugged RLL bronchus. By verbal report from the
ED, this was felt to be likely hemorrhagic consolidation of R
lung and possible RLL bronchus clot. Prelim read of CT
abdomen/pelvis was negative. Hct was found to be 31 and
differential was notable for 15 bands. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further care of pulmonary hemorrhage.
.
In the ED here, VS: 97.2, 88, 122/69, RR 14, 96% on 2L nc.
CXR revealed RLL and RUL opacities, and he was given doses of
levofloxacin and flagyl. He also received tylenol and morphine
for pain. His OSH CT was reviewed by radiology here and was read
as intraparenchymal hemorrhage on the R, but no RLL bronchus
clot. IP was [**Name (NI) 653**], and they recommended admission to the
ICU for bronchoscopy.

also seen; which may reflect multifocal pneumonia or developing
contusions. Please correlate clinically.

elevation in V2-V3. No change from prior from OSH (no prior here
for comparison).

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 70747**] is a 40 year old man with a history of depression who
presents with hemoptysis and dense RML and RLL consolidations in
the setting of chest wall trauma.
.
1) Pulmonary hemorrhage: Pt with history of chest wall trauma,
imaging concerning for pulmonary hemorrhage. Also with possible
RLL bronchus clot on CT read at OSH, radiology here does not
agree. Differential diagnosis of consolidations also includes
infection. However, hematocrit continued dropping at outside
hospital following admission, concerning for continued bleeding.
 In the ICU at [**Hospital1 18**], his hematocrit was stable and
Interventional Pulmonary opted to defer bronchoscopy.  The
patient had an elevated white count and was treated for possible
pneumonia (given fever, WBC) with levo/flagyl x 7 day course.
Pain controlled initially with dilaudid pca, changed to MScontin
with MSIR for breakthrough pain.  Given his ongoing therapy for
narcotics abuse, he was discharged with a Rx for Oxycodone 5 mg
#15, NRF.
.
2) Anemia: Hct around 30, but baseline unknown. Likely blood
loss anemia secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage based on imaging,
history of trauma. Hemodynamically stable.  Recommend iron
studies at outpatient follow-up.
.
3) Fever/Leukocytosis: Here, WBC 32 with left shift but no
bands. (At OSH, differential notable for 15 bands.)  Treating
possible pneumonia as above with levofloxacin/flagyl.  Patient
was afebrile with downward trending WBC at time of discharge.
.
4) Thrombocytosis: Marked thromocytosis both at OSH and here,
with unknown baseline. Most likely this is reactive
thromocytosis in the setting of hemorrhage/infection. Would
recommend follow-up as an outpatient.
.
5) RUQ tenderness: Mainly tender over the lower ribs (likely
either secondary to bruising from the fall vs. muscular strain
from coughing). CT abd/pelvis at OSH was reportedly negative for
evidence of subacute GI bleed.
.
6) Tobacco use: Pt recently was prescribed albuterol MDI.
Significant smoking history; was treated with nicotine
transdermal during until discharge.
.
7) Depression/anxiety: Continued valium and prozac per home
regimen.  Mr. [**Known lastname 70747**] was seen by Psychiatry consult service
following an attempt to leave AMA from the ICU. At that time, he
was deemed to lack capacity for his own medical decision-making
as he was experiencing some delirium and risk of medical
sequelae was considered to be high. On transfer to the floor, he
was reevaluated by Psychiatry who felt his cognitive status to
be significantly improved.  His outpatient psychiatrist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 59975**], was [**Name (NI) 653**], and follow-up appointment was arranged
for the day following discharge.  Patient has no further
episodes of self-injurious behavior and Psychiatry consultant
felt there was no contraindication to discharge home.

Discharge Instructions:
You were found to have bleeding in your right lung after a
traumatic injury you sustained.  Your bleeding has been
well-controlled over the past few days.  You were also treated
for pneumonia during this hospitalization.  You still have some
evidence of healing injury in the right lung, but your oxygen
levels are adequate to go home.
.
You were seen by psychiatry during this hospitalization.  You
should continue your previous regimen of Valium and Fluoxetine
and follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59975**].
.
You should continue to take around-the-clock ibuprofen for pain
control and for relief of the inflammation in your chest.  In
