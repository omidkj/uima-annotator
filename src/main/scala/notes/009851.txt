CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Sent to the Emergency Department for chest
pain during a stress test.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old male with
a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary
artery bypass graft surgery, insulin dependent-diabetes
mellitus, congestive heart failure, chronic atrial
fibrillation, and chronic renal insufficiency, who is sent to
the Emergency Department after having chest pain and
bilateral arm weakness during his stress test.  He did not
have any associated nausea, vomiting, or diaphoresis.  He did
not experience any palpitations.  He describes the chest pain
as more heaviness rather than chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.
2. Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass
graft surgery.
3. Insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus.
4. Anemia.
5. Gout.
6. Systolic congestive heart failure with an ejection
fraction of less than 20%.
7. Status post pacemaker ICD placement.
8. Chronic renal insufficiency.

ALLERGIES:  Morphine causing nausea.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Gemfibrozil 600 mg twice a day.
2. Lasix 20 mg daily.
3. Altace 5 mg daily.
4. Coumadin 5 mg daily except Sundays 2.5 mg.
5. Digoxin 0.125 mg Monday, Wednesday, [**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**First Name3 (LF) 1017**].
6. Allopurinol 150 mg daily.
7. Colchicine 0.5 mg q day.
8. Folic acid 1 mg daily.
9. Zebeta 5 mg.
10. Aspirin 325 mg daily.
11. Humalog insulin-sliding scale.
12. NPH insulin, 18 units in the morning, 5 units hs.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, occasional alcohol [**3-10**] drinks
per month, retired systems engineer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.7, heart rate 64, blood
pressure 112/50, respiratory rate 18, and oxygen saturation
is 99% on 2 liters.  General:  Alert and oriented in no acute
distress.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light.  Supple neck.  Jugular venous distention approximately
10 cm above the sternal notch.  Cardiovascular examination:
regular, rate, and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Lungs:  Faint crackles at the bases bilaterally.  Abdomen is
soft, nontender, nondistended.  Extremities:  No edema.
Neurologic is alert and oriented.  Cranial nerves II through
XII are grossly intact.  Strength are [**6-9**] bilaterally in
upper and lower extremities.

LABORATORY VALUES:  White blood cell count 5.6, hematocrit
37.3, platelets 124, MCV 100, INR 2.4.  Sodium 135, potassium
5.7, chloride 107, bicarb 16, BUN 97, creatinine 2.7, glucose
224.  Digoxin 0.8.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  Showed bigeminy with V-paced beats
alternating with intrinsic beats, left bundle branch block,
no acute changes, no ST-T wave changes.

CHEST X-RAY:  Showed stable cardiomegaly without evidence of
acute cardiopulmonary disease.

Stress test revealed extensive reversible ischemic changes
with an ejection fraction of 19%.  MIBI revealed severe
global hypokinesis with large inferior wall and moderate
anterior apical defects, severe systolic dysfunction with
septal hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 19%.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Chest pain/positive stress test:  The patient underwent
cardiac catheterization which revealed severe native vessel
coronary artery disease with one patent saphenous vein graft
to OM graft with two focal stenoses, markedly elevated right
and left sided filling pressures, successful stenting of the
right coronary artery, ostial saphenous vein graft lesion,
and distal saphenous vein graft lesion.  An intra-aortic
balloon pump was placed prophylactically secondary to the
patient's severe systolic dysfunction.  The patient was
transferred to the CCU for monitoring, and was transferred to
the floor after only a short stay.

The patient was given Mucomyst and IV fluid hydration prior
to catheterization in light of his chronic renal
insufficiency.

2. Systolic congestive heart failure:  The patient was
admitted on daily Lasix, ACE inhibitor, digoxin, and a beta
blocker.  His diuretics and ACE inhibitor were held initially
secondary to his acute on chronic renal insufficiency.  On
discharge, the patient was restarted on his ACE inhibitor,
however, his daily Lasix will be held until his follow-up
appointment with his cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  The patient
will measure his weights daily, and will notify Dr.[**Name (NI) 23312**]
office if his weight increases more than five pounds.

3. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency:  The patient has
chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of 1.5
to 1.8, which is likely secondary to diabetic nephropathy.
On admission, the patient's creatinine was 2.7.  The
patient's Lasix, ACE inhibitor, Allopurinol, and colchicine
were all held because they were felt to be major contributors
to his acute renal failure.  The renal team was consulted.
It was felt that the patient's acute on chronic renal failure
was secondary to a large component of prerenal hypovolemia as
well as renal tubular acidosis type IV.

The patient was started on sodium bicarbonate 650 mg twice a
day, and was given IV fluid hydration including normal saline
with bicarbonate.  The patient's creatinine responded well to
IV hydration and holding of nephrotoxic medications and on
the day of discharge, his creatinine had returned to his
baseline at 1.5.  The patient will continue to take sodium
bicarbonate as an outpatient.  He will also be taking his
daily ACE inhibitor and daily Allopurinol.  He will not take
his colchicine unless he has an acute flare of gout.

4. Diabetes mellitus:  The patient was continued on his fixed
doses of NPH, and was placed on an insulin-sliding scale.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Home.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  Please follow up with your primary
