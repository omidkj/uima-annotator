Pertinent Results:
[**2143-5-2**] Echo: PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. 2. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. 3. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %). 5. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. 6. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. 7. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. 8.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 9. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified
in person of the results. POST-CPB: On infusion of
phenylephrine. AV pacing briefly. Well-seated bioprosthetic
valve in the aortic position. Trivial central AI, no
paravalvular leak. Peak gradient is 16 mmHg with a cardiac
output of 5.5 L/min. MR remains 1+. The aortic contour is normal
post decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, Mr. [**Known lastname 4148**] was transferred from the
outside hospital with severe aortic stenosis. Upon admission he
underwent a cardiac cath which revealed clean coronaries and
also showed severe aortic stenosis. Following cath he was
admitted for surgical work-up.

He underwent dental extractions and then on [**5-2**] he was brought
to the Operating Room for aortic valve replacement and left
atrial appendage ligation. Following surgery he was transferred
to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable condition. Later
that day he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically
intact and extubated. On post-op day one he was started on
beta-blocker and diuretics and gently diuresed towards his
preoperative weight.

Later that day he was transferred to the step-down floor for
further care. Chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were
removed per protocol. Coumadin was restarted for his chronic
atrial fibrillation. He worked with Physical Therapy for
strength and mobility.

He developed loose stool, C Diff was negative.  Loose stool is
thought to be from Metformin (which he has had problems with in
the past).  This was stopped and he was started on Glyburide.

He was discharged to the [**Doctor First Name 391**] [**Hospital **] rehab on POD 4.
