Echo [**2196-4-25**]
The left ventricle is not well seen. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function
cannot be reliably assessed. However, the apex appears
hypokinetic and the rest of the left ventricle appears to
contract somewhat more vigorously. The right ventricular cavity
is dilated with depressed free wall contractility.

A pericardial effusion may be present, but could not be
quantitated due to the technically suboptimal nature of this
study. There are no echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade
present.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital on [**2101-4-20**] for
pre-ooperative workup and brought to the operating room on
[**2196-4-21**] where the patient underwent urgent coronary artery
bypass x 3.  Overall the patient tolerated the procedure well
and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  Cefazolin was
used for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis, as he experienced
urticaria with vancomycin.  POD 1 found the patient extubated,
alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable on no inotropic
or vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the
patient was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  The
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery.  Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
without complication.  The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By
the time of discharge on POD 4 the patient was ambulating
freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged home in good condition
with appropriate follow up instructions.
