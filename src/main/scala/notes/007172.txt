Attending:[**Last Name (un) 2888**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2179-7-13**] cardiac catheterization
[**2179-7-13**] intubation
[**2179-7-13**] Tandem Heart placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 25586**] is a 74yo male with history HTN, DMII, CKD on PD,
CAD, ischemic systolic and diastolic CHF (EF 15%), VT s/p ICD
[**8-29**], recently hospitalized for NSTEMI s/p BMS to RCA for 99%
occlusion of old stents([**5-1**]), and history of chest pain not
relieved with recent stenting now presenting with chest pain.

Per patient pain started abruptly at 7pm on the night of
presentation. Pain, described as a pressure, is substernally
located with occassional radiation to bilateral upper
extremities and lower jaw. Denies associated n/v/dyspnea. Pain
is exacerbation when supine; no correlation with exertion. Took
3 SL nitro prior to presentation which helped to alleviate pain.
Overall, pain very similar to pain that promted [**Month/Year (2) 12876**]
in [**Month (only) 116**] when he got the BMS, and also similar to pain that
promted ED presentation on [**2179-6-25**]. Pharmacologic stress test on
[**2179-6-25**] demonstrated severe extensive fixed myocardial perfusion
defect, similar in extent compared to [**2172**], with markedly
increased left ventricular enlargement and decreased LVEF of
15%. Pacermaker was also interrogated yesterday ([**2179-7-12**]) and
found to be functioning normally.

Also of note, has had intermittent othostatic symptoms and low
BPs as an outpatient so has been off and on beta-blockers and
ACE-I since stenting. BP runs in 80-90s systolic.

In arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vitals were 6 97.8 96 96/55
18 100%. Labs with troponin/CKMB on presentation uptrending
while in ED: Trop 0.27 -> 0.86, CKMB: 7 -> 22, CK 55 -> 207.  CT
with contrast without dissection. Bedside US with small
pericardial effusion, EKG: no change, no obvious ischemia, L
bundle branch block. Patient then triggered for hypotension with
systolic nadir in the 60s. A triple lume central line was placed
without complications. Started on levophed 0.09mcg/kg/min.
Decision initially made to forego heparin ggt in the ED but
cardiology fellow was contact[**Name (NI) **] for [**Name (NI) **] ECHO. ECHO showed new
mod-severe mitral regurg and new posterior wall hypokinesis
compared to recent ECHOs. Decision was made to take the patient
straight to cath [**Name (NI) **] for likely RCA stent re-occlusion.
.
.
On arrival to CCU patient was stable but quickly transfered to
cath [**Name (NI) **] for intervention. In cath [**Name (NI) **] occlusion found between
left main and circ and stent was depolyed there, and coded with
PEA shortly thereafter. Concern that either LAD jailed or that
plaque was disrupted into ALD. CPR started and balloon pump
placed. Unable to obtain good cardiac output so tandem heart
placed and pressors started. Further PCI with stent placement in
areas of occlusion. Poor-no circulation somewhere between
10-30min. Discussions were had with family during code to update
them of proceedings. While in [**Name (NI) **] received 3 units of PRBC, 4
amps of bicarb with no change in pH.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: unable to obtain as patient intubated and
sedated

Past Medical History:
1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: +Diabetes, +Dyslipidemia, +
Hypertension
(also with hypotension issues with baseline BPs low in the
80-90s)
2. CARDIAC HISTORY:
-prior MI in [**2153**]
-CABG: none
-PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS:
-> PTCA of the LAD and RCA,
-> BMS to RCA in [**5-1**] for 99% occlusion of proximal RCA
-PACING/ICD:
-> s/p ICD in [**2175**] for VT
3. OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
- Crohns Disease
- Bladder cancer rx s/p TURBT [**2174-1-11**]
- Lung adenocarcinoma T1 N0 s/p R VATS RLL lobectomy [**12-28**] for
3cm lesion. Last Heme/Onc f/u [**8-/2178**] noted to have RUL
ground-glass opacity persisting and growing in size. Was 11 x 20
mm from 11 x 17 mm in [**Month (only) 116**]. Referred to thoracic [**Doctor First Name **] and
underwent cyberknife in 11/[**2177**]. Last f/u with thoracics [**2179-5-20**]
thought that PET with  pulmonary mass and the paratracheal
lymphadenopathy could be post radiation and inflammatory in the
setting of fairly recent PNA. Pt too frail to undergo pretty
much any therapy (RT or chemo) even if these areas/masses are
malignant. Plan to bring back in several months with a CT chest
to re-evaluate any progression (if malignant and need to obtain
tissue) or perhaps, regression (if inflammatory).

Social History:
Pt is a retired church decorator. Lives in [**Location 4310**] with his wife.
[**Name (NI) **] quit smoking in [**2153**], but has ~75 pack-yr history. Rare

- Father died of oral/laryngeal cancer. Paternal cousin and
paternal uncle both died of lung cancer.
- His sister has Breast cancer.
- No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies,
or suddencardiac death; otherwise non-contributory

Physical Exam:

CARDIAC: Regular rate from tandemheart
LUNGS: difficult to assess posterior, anterior fields with
diffuse rales
ABDOMEN: distened greater than baseline, no HSM, unable to
assess tenderness
EXTREMITIES: cold and clammy, Femoral bruit from tandem, tandem
heart catheters in both groins
