STUDIES:

highly concerning for pneumonia. Known right apical mass appears
slightly decreased in size compared to the prior exam. Trace
left pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION:
1. Extensive consolidation involving the majority of the left
lung. This is new from [**2140-9-9**] and consistent with
extensive pneumonia. Trace left pleural effusion. The majority
of opacification is related to consolidation as opposed to
effusion. No endobronchial lesion identified.
2. Interval cavitation of known right upper lobe mass. Two
additional right lower lobe lesions with cavitation concerning
for metastatic deposits. Peripheral to the right upper lobe
lesion, additional areas of
post-obstructive inflammation/infection or possible lymphangitic

carcinomatosis are seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
PRINCIPLE REASON FOR ADMISSION

Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 60 year old man with h/o recently diagnosed SCLC,
s/p C1 Cis/Etoposide, who was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with fever
and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation, found to
have Legionella PNA.

#. Legionella PNA: Patient was admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] after presenting
to ER with hypoxia hypotension. Patient required intubation and
levophed for respiratory and circulatory support. Chest Xray and
CT showed extensive pneumonia. Patient was empirically started
on vancomycin, zosyn and levofloxacin. Patient was also trreated
with flagyl and cefepime during ICU stay. Antiobiotics were
narrowed to levofloxacin after bronchial washings and urine were
positive for legionella. Patient was successfully extubated and
transferred to the OMED floor on standing albuterol and
ipratropium. Oxygen was weaned as tolerated and patient was
discharged satting mid90s on RA with plan to complete 21 day
course of levofloxacin on [**2140-10-19**].

#. Leukocytosis: Patient with impressive leukocytosis during
admission, peaking at 53.7 on [**10-3**]. Suspect due to infection and
effect of neulasta following chemotherapy. Trended down and was
12.3 at discharge.

#. Thrombocytosis: Plt count steadily increased during stay, up
to 1449 on [**10-9**]. Etiology was originally attributed to acute
phase reactant due to PNA and malignancy. To evaluate for
myeloproliferative effect, JAK2 level was measured, and pending
at time of discharge. Patient was started on ASA 81 daily.

#. SCLC: Patient presented during C1 Cis/Etoposide. Patient
underwent 3 fractions XRT as previously planned after transfer
to the floor and is to continue follow up with radiaton oncology
as outpatient.

#. Anemia: HCT trended down after admission to 25.8, and patient
was provided 1 unit pRBC in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with appropriate increase.
After transfusion, HCT ag
