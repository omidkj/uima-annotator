Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 26172**] is a 79 year-old woman with a history of COPD who
presented with dyspnea, hypoxemia, CXR consistent with left
multifocal pneumonia.

# Pneumonia/Respiratory Distress: Patient with marked
leukocytosis with bandemia, tachypnea, tachycardia initially
thought to be secondary to pneumonia.  Her oxygen requirement
improved with antibiotic treatment with vancomycin, cefepime and
ciprofloxacin, however her chest x-ray continued to worsen,
concerning for a possible malignancy.  With her deteriorating
lung function over the past several months and her goals of
care, a meeting was held with her daughters and outpatient
providers the final decision was made to continue antibiotic
treatment for a full 14 day course since we were unable to
obtain a sputum culture, along with supplemental oxygen therapy
but otherwise to focus on comfort.  She was started on an
increased dose of klonopin, along with dilaudid 1-2mg Q2h prn
breathlessness, zyprexa QHS and prn ativan, the dilaudid was the
most helpful for her symptoms.  Her antibiotic course will be
completed on [**2112-6-1**].  She will also be continued on prednisone
35mg daily and standing nebulizer treatments to help with her
breathing.

exacerbation with prednisone 60 mg daily for 5 days, standing
