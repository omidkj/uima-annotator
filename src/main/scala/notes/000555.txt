History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 106495**] is a 73 year old man with a history of AAA repair in
[**2120**], hyperlipidemia, SVT who presents with chest pain this
afternoon and found to have a STEMI. Mr. [**Known lastname 106495**] was running on
the treadmill at the gym and after the work out he noticed he
started to feel uncomfortable. He then noticed left sided chest
pressure that was not getting better. He then noted the pressure
was turning into pain and he turned to look for a trainer. He
noted associated dizziness, diaphoresis. When he found a
trainer, the trainer called 911 and EMS brought him to the ER.

In the ER, the patient was found to have an inferior STEMI. He
was plavix loaded with 600mg PO ONCE, Aspirin 324mg PO ONCE,
heparin bolus, eptifibatide bolus, and was given sublingual
nitroglycerin. He was rushed to the cath lab. In the cath lab,
he was found to have a completely occluded mid RCA clot, that
was removed and a DES was placed with good flow. He was also
noted to have a 60-70% proximal LAD lesion and an 80% distal LAD
lesion, clean LMCA, and LCx with mild dz. Repeat EKG showed
resolution of his ST elevations and his pain completely
resolved.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

CATH:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
two-vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA was free of
angiographically significant disease. The LAD had serial
stenoses with a
60-70% stenosis in the proximal segment and an 80% stenosis in
the
distal segment. The LCx had only mild diffuse disease. Overall
the left
system was relatively small compared with the right. The mid-RCA
was
thrombotically occluded. There were no distal collaterals.
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed normal resting central
aortic
pressure (105/62mmHg).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease with mid-RCA occlusion as
culprit
for STEMI.
2. Normal resting central aortic pressures.
3. RCA STENTED WITH BMS

ECHO [**2124-3-9**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with hypokinesis of the basal and mid inferior and
inferolateral segments. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild focal LV systolic dysfunction consistent with
CAD. No significant valvular abnormality seen.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 year old man with a history of AAA repair in [**2120**],
hyperlipidemia, SVT who presents with chest pain this afternoon
and found to have a STEMI who is doing well after PCI.
.
# STEMI: Patient presents with an RCA MI consistent with
inferior territory, who improved significantly after PCI. No
signs of RV failure or shock. His LAD lesions are likely not
symptomatic given his excellent baseline functional capacity,
however, this will need to be reassessed in 1 month.  His ASA
was continued at 325 for 1 month, then 81 for life. Plavix 75mg
PO daily was started for at least 1 year. Atorva 80mg PO daily
was started. Pt was given Eptifibatide for 18 hours post PIC. An
Echo was performed which showed. Lisinopril and Metoprolol XL
were started.

# CHF: No signs of CHF on exam.

# RHYTHM: Sinus rhythm at present, no evidence of VT or SVT. Pt
had some PVCs but no runs of SVT.

# LDL pipid panel showed well controlled lipids. Atorva 80 was
started

# Asthma: Stable. Home Albuterol PRN was continued.

# GERD:  Pt was dc/ed on home omeprazole.
