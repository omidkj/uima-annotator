Pertinent Results:
Echo [**7-27**]: PRE-CPB: The left ventricular cavity is severely
dilated. There is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic
valve is functionally bicuspid. There is no valvular aortic
stenosis. The increased transaortic gradient is likely related
to aortic regurgitation. Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric, directed toward
the anterior mitral leaflet. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. POST-CPB: After first separation from CPB, on an
epinephrine infusion, there was normal RV systolic function. The
LV demonstrated mild to moderate global hypokinesis with an EF
about 40% -slightly improved from pre-CPB. The bioprosthesis
appeared well seated but there was a moderate, eccentric jet of
AI that appeared perivalvular. It emanated from the region of
the native right coronary cusp. There was also trace valvular
AI. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified and the patient was returned to CPB.
A repair of the perivalvular leak was attempted but the AI was
no better on TEE imaging performed after cross-clamp removal
before attempt of CPB wean. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] then replaced the valve.
After weaning from bypass the second time, with epinephrine
infusion running, there was normal RV systolic function. The LV
displayed moderate global dysfunction with an EF of 35%. The
aortic bioprosthesis was well seated and leaflet function
appeared normal. There was a mild to moderate perivalvular jet
of AI immanating from the same point noted above. There was no
AS.
CXR [**8-3**]: Status post sternotomy and position of small metallic
prosthesis valve components in aortic ostium are unchanged. The
same holds for the heart size and the appearance of the thoracic
aorta. No increased pulmonary vascular congestion is identified.
The bilateral pleural effusions are still visible, but
comparison suggests further regression since [**8-1**]. The
lateral view confirms this impression as the pleural densities
in the lower portions of major fissures and posterior pleural
sinuses also have receded. No new parenchymal infiltrates are
identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit and was taken to the operating
room on [**7-27**] where he underwent an Aortic Valve Replacement.
Please see operative report for surgical details. Later on op
day he was weaned from sedation, awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated. He also received 1 unit PRBCs. He was weaned from
his vasoactive drips and transferred to the floor on post-op day
one. Beta blockers and diuretics were initiated. He was gently
diuresed towards his pore-op weight. On post-op day three his
chest tubes were removed and he was also transfused 2 units
PRBCs for a HCT of 17. He again received 2 units of PRBCs on
post-op day [**3-10**]. His discharge HCT was 31.3. He had several
short bursts of AFIB which were appropriately treated.
Epicardial pacing wires were removed post-op day six. He then
again had episode of atrial fibrillation which lasted longer and
Heparin was initially started and eventually stopped. He was
discharged in SR. Physical therapy followed pt during entire
post-op course for strength and mobility. On post-op nine he
appeared clinically stable and was discharged home with VNA
services and the appropriate follow-up appointments.
