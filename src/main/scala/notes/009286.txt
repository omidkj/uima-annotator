Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6021**]
Chief Complaint:
s/p tracheostomy (elective)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1.  Awake tracheotomy.
2.  Direct laryngoscopy.
3.  Esophagoscopy.

5.  Laparoscopic gastrostomy tube insertion.


History of Present Illness:
78-year-old woman who has had dyspnea, dysphagia, and hoarseness
since [**3-8**].  These symptoms progressed, and by late [**Month (only) **] she was
experiencing choking on with eating, intermittent dysphagia with
solids, and shortness of breath that she attributed to
increasing mucus production.

Laryngoscopy in [**Hospital **] clinic [**5-29**] showed a supraglottic mass.  A
[**5-30**] neck CT demonstrated a left-sided supraglottic mass
extending from the epiglottitis to the left vocal cord.  She was
electively admitted [**2132-6-6**] for a planned tracheostomy and direct
laryngoscopy for a recently discovered laryngeal mass.

At the time of admission, she was eating without report of
aspiration.

[**2132-6-6**] Tracheostomy tube is present with the tip at the thoracic
inlet. Subcutaneous emphysema on both sides of the neck is
present consistent with recent surgery. No pneumothorax is seen.
Atelectasis of the left base is present. Degree of failure is
seen. Some densities are present in the left upper zone
consistent with the pleural calcifications seen on the CT.
.
[**2132-6-6**] Biopsy: Left larynx, supraglottic mass, biopsy:
Poorly differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma


Brief Hospital Course:
78-year-old woman with a laryngeal mass, diagnosed with poorly
differentiated laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, stable with
tracheostomy and G-tube placement.
.
#. Carcinoma: Biopsy of the laryngeal mass done [**6-6**] demonstrated
poorly differentiated, invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
Intraop findings were notable for a bulky exophytic mass
emanating from left aryepiglottic fold extending to medial wall
of left piriform sinus and onto left true cord.  Elective
tracheostomy was also done on [**6-6**].  She tolerated the procedure
well.  She required oxygen by trach mask.  She initially
required quite a lot of suctioning but was later able to clear
secretions mostly on her own.  Patient underwent first session
of planning by XRT on [**6-18**], and should follow up with the rest
of her session appointments on [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] 5 at [**Hospital1 18**].  She will
also [**Hospital1 4939**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for possible chemotherapy.
.
#. Pneumonia: There was concern that the patient may have had an
aspiration event complicated by pneumonia following her
tracheostomy procedure. Her WBC count rose to 18.6 two days
following the procedure, although she never manifested a clear
infiltrate on CXR and was not febrile.  Sputum cultures were
obtained but no pathogens were isolated.  She was initially
treated with five days of levofloxacin; this was broadened to
pip/tazo on when she developed increased secretions.  Her
secretions have since diminished.  She completed 5 days of
pip/tazo for a total 10 day course.
.
#. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: She had no prior hx of a-fib
before admission, however, while monitored in the ICU she had at
least three episodes of paroxysmal Afib.  Cardiac enzymes were
negative.  She remained in sinus rhythm following this.
Metoprolol was given at 37.5 mg TID; upon discharge it was
changed to 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
#. Dysphagia: she had difficulty with swallowing since prior to
admission. Following her tracheostomy, she had coughing after
attempting PO intake.  She had aspiration during her swallowing
evalulation as.  Laproscopic G tube placement was performed on
[**6-10**].  She is tolerating tube feedings very well and remains
NPO. Free water flushes were increased to 250 Q4 hours due to
hypernatremia.
.
#. Pleural Effusions: These were relatively stable on CXR.
However, given her effusions and peripheral edema, we felt she
warrented evaluation for CHF.  Echo showed normal EF (>55%),
mild atrial dilation, moderate PA systolic hypertension.
She was oxygenating well and it was felt she did not need
maintenance lasix.
.
#. Hypertension: Her lisinopril was stopped in favor of rate
control with metoprolol (following episode of paroxysmal Afib).
As BPs have been normal to high, her metoprolol may need to be
titrated up.  Her diuretics (triamterene/HCTZ) were held given
clinical stability and transient hypernatremia.  These can be
restarted at rehab as needed for edema or [**Month/Year (2) **] pressure
control.
.
# COPD: Albuterol and ipratropium neb treatments were given.

#. Hyperlipidemia: Atorvastatin was continued.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for a planned tracheotomy and biopsy of the
mass near your vocal cords.  The biopsy showed squamous cell
carcinoma, a type of cancer.  You met some oncology doctors and [**Name5 (PTitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) 4939**] with them as an outpatient.  We also inserted a
tube into your stomach for eating because you were having
difficulty swallowing.
.
Please take all of your medications as prescribed and keep all
of your scheduled appointments.
.
Please return to the hospital if you have difficulty breathing,
change in phlegm, fever, abdominal pain, or any other new
symptoms that you are concerned about.
.
We started the medications Metoprolol and lansoprazole while you
were here.  We have stopped your lisinopril and triamterene/HCTZ
for now, but these may been added back by your doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] for
[**Name5 (PTitle) **] pressure control.
