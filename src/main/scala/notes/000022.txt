History of Present Illness:
78 year-old male patient of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 28622**] Attar and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11493**] who has a history that includes CAD, s/p MI X 2, s/p CABG
in [**2139**], s/p prior stent to LAD and s/p prior PTCA of the
diagonal who was admitted to [**Hospital6 17032**] on
[**2146-5-7**] with shortness of breath.  He was diagnosed with acute
on
chronic CHF with initial BNP 482.  He was diuresed with IV Lasix
and ruled out for an MI with negative cardiac enzymes.  A
nuclear
stress was performed on [**5-9**] showed several areas with
questionable reversible inferolateral and anteroapical ischemic
changes but no EKG changes or chest pain.  It was believed that
his heart rate response was blunted [**2-14**] high dose BBlocker and
deconditioning.  The overall duration of his treadmill time was
5 minutes with a heart rate max of 81 bpm.  He was discharged to
home but returned to the [**Location (un) **]
ED with continued complaints of shortness of breath.  Cardiac
enzymes were negative and he is now transferred for a cardiac
cathterization for further evaluation of his symptoms.

In cath lab, pt was unable to lie flat secondary to history of
PTSD, claustrophia, and anxiety and therefore required
intubation.  A 90% distal lesion, just beyond the PDA was
stented with a [**Location (un) **].  At the end of the procedure, an NGT was
placed to dose plavix.  Pt had already been started on
integrelin and heparin.  Subsequently, the patient developed a
significant nose bleed.  Heparin and integrelin were held, ENT
was called, pressure was held and the patient was given
intranasal afrin.  Right heart cath also notable for elevated
RVEDP (16 mm Hg) and PCWP (28 mm Hg mean).

Cardiac cath ([**5-13**]): 1. Coronary angiography of this right
dominant system revealed native three vessel coronary artery
disease. The LMCA had a distal 50% stenosis. The LAD was
occluded in the mid-vessel. The major diagonal branch had an
ostial 60% stenosis. The LCx had a long 60% lesion in OM1. The
RCA had a 90% stenosis just beyond the origin of the PDA.
2. Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated patent LIMA-D1 and
SVG-OM
grafts. The SVG-OM was occluded proximally. 3. Resting
hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling
pressures (RVEDP 16 mm Hg, PCWP mean 28 mm Hg). There was
moderate to severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PASP 61 mm
Hg). The systemic arterial blood pressure was normal (SBP 122 mm
Hg). The cardiac index was normal at 2.7 l/min/m2. The systemic
vascular resistance was normal (911 dynes-sec/cm5). The
pulmonary vascular resistance was normal (PVR 135
dynes-sec/cm5). 4. Successful PTCA and stenting of the distal
RCA jailing the right PDA with a Xience (3x18mm) drug eluting
stent postdilated with a 3.25mm balloon.  Final angiography
demonstrated no angiographically apparent dissection, no
residual stenosis and TIMI III flow throughout the vessel (See
PTCA comments). 5. Successful closure of the right femoral
arteriotomy site with a Mynx closure device.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Native three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA-D1 and SVG-LAD grafts.
3. Occluded SVG-OM graft.
4. Moderate biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
5. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
6. Successful PTCA and stenting of the distal RCA with a Xience
drug
eluting stent.
7. Successful closure of the right femoral arteriotomy site with
a Mynx
closure device.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 year-old man who was referred from OSH for a cardiac
catheterization secondary to persistent shortness of breath.

# Coronary Artery Disease - Patient with known hx of CAD, prior
CABG, prior stent/PTCA was referred for cardiac ctah for
persistent shortness of breath. Patient did not tolerate lying
flat for procedure due to significant history of claustrophobia,
PTSD and anxiety and was intubated for the procedure. He was
started on heparin, integrillin and plavix loaded pre-procedure
however developed severe epistaxis after intubation and
integrilin was stopped.  Cardiac cath showed distal 90% RCA
lesion and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] was placed. He was continued on aspirin,
plavix and statin.  After cath, he remained intubated for airway
protection from epistaxis nad was admitted to CCU for closer
management. He was extubated on hospital day #2 without
complication.
.
# Chronic systolic heart failure - Ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF
20%. RHC notable for elevated RVEDP (16 mm Hg) and PCWP (28 mm
Hg mean). After catheterization he was diuresed with bolus lasix
and his home dose of lasix was increased to 100mg [**Hospital1 **]. He was
continued on Inspra, Diovan and Toprol. At time of discharge
exam was notable for lower extremity edema, but patient had no
evidence of pulmonary edema with no oxygen requirement so he was
instructed to continue higher dose of lasix until he could
discuss lasix titration with his cardiologist as an outpatient.
.
# Epistaxis - Developed during cardiac catheterization and ENT
was consulted. This was managed with Afrin. Estimated blood loss
of 200cc which stabilized without tranfusion. This resolved
within 24 hours with no recurrent events.
.
# Hypertension: He was continued on home [**Hospital1 4319**] of Lasix, Diovan,
Norvasc, Inspra and Toprol with good control
.
# Hyperlipidemia: We do not have most recent lipid panel. On
admission he was on tricor and sta
