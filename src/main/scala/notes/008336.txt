Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 2031**] was an 81 year old woman with history of CAD s/p
multiple MIs, CABG 4v, presented to outside hospital with new
lung mass, post obstructive pneumonia, who subsequently
developed chest pain after albuterol nebulization treatment and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] Cardiac Intensive Care Unit for concern
of acute coronary syndrome.

#Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient was hemodynamically stable
on presentation to the CCU, requiring 4L O2 by NC.  CXR showed a
likely large lung mass in the right lung field.  An ABG showed
the patient had a large A-a gradient.  The patient had
intermittend hypoxic episodes that became increasingly frequent
associated with chest pain.  There was concern for PE, and
heparin was started.  Antibiotics were started as well for a
post-obstructive pneumonia.  Lasix was given for possible CHF
exacerbation, and nebulizers and methylprednisolone was given
for possible COPD exacerbation.

Despite these measures, the patient however continued to
deteriorate rapidly and she became delirious.  The family was
[**Name (NI) 653**], who indicated that the primary goal of the patient
and the family was comfort.  A family meeting was held, and the
patient all interventions with the exception of comfort measures
were discontinued.  A morphine drip was started, and the patient
expired on [**2108-2-22**] at 3:15pm.
