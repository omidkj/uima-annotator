History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 86 yo male with h/o CAD s/p stent, SVT s/p pacer, AAA
repair, recently diagnosed metastatic lung CA with mets to L4
currently undergoing radiation to L spine, last radiation [**3-9**].
He was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] after they noticed
increased lethargy, confusion and restlessness this AM. He had
had poor PO intake the past few days. He does have a cough and
reports emesis, although is not reliable secondary to confusion.
He is knows that he is in a hospital but does not know which
one. He knows his birthday but not the date. In the ED, he was
given IVF. CXR was unchanged, and CT head showed no new mets or
bleed. per his daughter, he has been extremely confused since
being at [**Hospital3 **] and is perhaps overmedicated with
morphine.

LEUK-NEG
[**2161-3-10**] - Head CT - No acute intracranial process; MR more
sensitive to detect metastatic disease.
[**2161-3-10**] - CXR - Residual vs. recurrent air space disease in the
right lower lobe as detailed above. Known left pulmonary nodule,
stable.
[**2161-3-11**] - CT Chest with and without contrast - 1. No evidence of
a central venous thrombus.
2. Multifocal predominantly peribronchial ground glass change
bilaterally. The differential is broad including multifocal
infection. Treatment related effects can also be considered.
3. Left upper lobe spiculated mass and mediastinal
lymphadenopathy again appreciated.
4. New right adrenal lesion worrisome for metastasis.
5. Apparent new right renal mid pole hypodensity is of unclear
etiology. Metastasis may have this appearance though a renal
infarct may also appear similar.
6. Subcutaneous fluid stranding around the right shoulder and
scapular region incompletely imaged.
[**2161-3-11**] - CXR -
1) Rapidly evolving bilateral interstitial process, which may be
due to interstitial edema from fluid overload considering
history of recent hydration. Atypical pneumonia is also possible
in the appropriate clinical setting.
2) Peripheral left upper lobe lung nodule is suggestive of lung
cancer.
[**2161-3-12**] - Echo -
no definite vegetations seen (suboptimal study); basal inferior
posterior infarct; mild aortic stenosis
CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT  [**2161-3-15**]
FINDINGS: interval development bibasilar patchy opacities
concerning for underlying evolving pneumonia. There is a
persistent focal opacity along the lateral aspect of the left
hemithorax may reflect underlying focal atelectasis and/or
pneumonia. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly stable.
No pneumothorax is seen. Endotracheal tube terminates 3.6 cm
above the carina. A NGT tube is in place that terminates below
the gastroesophageal junction and beyond the inferior margin of
the film.
EGD [**2161-3-15**]
Findings: Zenker's diverticulum noted- making esophageal
intubation difficult. Large blood clot visible in duodenal bulb-
protruding from pylorus. Multiple epinephrine injections were
attempted at base of clot. Ulcer bed was not clearly visualized.
Post-bulbar duodenum appeared normal.
Esophagitis.
ECG Study Date of [**2161-3-15**]
Atrial fibrillation. Demand ventricular pacing. Left axis
deviation. Right bundle-branch block with probable left anterior
fascicular block. Ventricular ectopy/aberrant conduction.
Compared to the previous tracing the rate is slower.
CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  [**2161-3-17**]
1. Perforation of the duodenum with pneumoperitoneum and
extraluminal oral contrast
2. Interval development of compression fracture of L4 lumbar
vertebra with stable soft tissue mass of the pedicle of L4. As
no IV contrast has been used, assessment of thecal sac
compression cannot be performed.
3. Diverticulosis with no evidence of diverticulitis.
4. New mass in right adrenal gland concerning for metastatic
disease
TTE (Complete) [**2161-3-18**]
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Compared with the prior
study (images reviewed) of [**2161-3-16**], at least moderate mitral
regurgitation and right ventricular cavity enlargement/free wall
hypokinesis is now seen. If clinically indicated, a TEE would be
better able to define the mitral valve structure and clarify the
severity of mitral regurgitation.
ECG [**2161-3-18**]
Sinus rhythm; Atrial and ventricular ectopic activity; Leftward
axis; Right bundle branch block; Inferior T wave changes are
nonspecific; Low QRS voltages in precordial leads; Since
previous tracing of [**2161-3-15**], atrial fibrillation resolved
CXR [**2161-3-20**]
IMPRESSION: Small right pleural effusion has decreased and
previous mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has improved since
[**3-18**]. LLL atelectasis and moderate cardiomegaly persists.
Increasing opacification of LUL is probably a combination of
asymmetric residual edema and atelectasis following tracheal
extubation. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer
leads follow their expected courses. No pneumothorax.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2161-3-22**]
There is a left-sided dual-lead pacemaker. There is mild left
ventricular prominence. There is prominence of the pulmonary
vascular markings suggestive of pulmonary edema. There is a
focal area of opacity in the right lung field which is likely
due to edema, however a developing infiltrate cannot be
excluded.
CHANGE GASTROSTOMY TUBE  [**2161-3-24**]
IMPRESSION: Patent G-tube and J-tube without evidence of leak
UNILAT UP EXT VEINS US PORT RIGHT  [**2161-3-24**]
IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence of right upper extremity DVT.
Portable TTE [**2161-3-24**]
IMPRESSION: No valvular vegetations seen. Moderate global left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
Mild aortic regurgitation
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2161-3-25**]
Mild bilateral pulmonary edema which has decreased. A persistent
left mid lung peripheral opacity reflecting the previously
diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma. Slight decrease in LLL
atelectasis which is mild. Persistent small right basilar
atelectasis is again
