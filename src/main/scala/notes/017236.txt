History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 3614**] is an 81 year old female with HTN, HL, ESRD on HD,
CHF, who has been at [**Hospital **] [**Hospital 701**] rehab who presented to
[**Hospital3 **] on [**2190-4-4**] with acute onset of shortness of breath an
hypoxia. In [**12-21**], she had a colectomy & ileostomay seconadry to
obstruction which was complicated by respiartory failure
secondary to aspiration requiring trach and PEG. She also
developed renal failure and was initiated on HD. She was
discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehab where she has suffered several
infectiosn (MRSA PNA, MRSA bacteremia, VRE UTI). At one point,
she was seen at [**Hospital1 336**] for "white-out of her right lung",
underwent bronch. She was evaluated for stent placement, but the
TBM was thought to be too distal to be amenable to stenting. She
then was transferred back to [**Hospital1 **]. One week later, she
devleoped acute SOB with hypoxia to the 70s. She was given
morphine, bumex, and solumedrol without significant improvement.
She was placed on BIPAP with some improvement and was
trasnferred to [**Hospital3 **] for further management. At some point in
her recent past, she was treated with Vanc/Gent for HAP.

On admission to [**Hospital3 **], she was found to be hypoxic and placed
on BIPAP. A CTA was performed and was negative for PE or
pneumonia, but suggestive of atelectasis. Nevertheless, she was
treated with empiric broad spectrum antibiotics for PNA with
vanco/levaquin/ceftazidime --> levaquin/ceftaz for unclear
reasons. She remained bipap depended for days, but was becoming
progressively more tired. She ultimately was intubated today.
Her WBC was initially 27. UCx showed yeast (not [**Female First Name (un) **]) so she
was started on amphotericin b bladder washes. Her WBC trended
down from 27 to 20.

Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, she was intubated and sedated so
unable to obtain further history from the patient.

CT chest [**2190-4-14**]:
1. Widespread peribronchiolar abnormalities, suggestive of an
evolving bronchopneumonia with extensive bronchiolitis
component. The findings are not specific for a particular
organism, but pseudomonas should be considered considering
apparent nosocomial infection. Other potential etiologies
include viral, mycoplasma and less likely granulumatous
infection.
2. Small pleural effusions, left greater than right.
3. Low-lying endotracheal tube, which should be withdrawn
several centimeters for standard positioning.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 81 year old female with HTN, HL, CHF, ESRD on HD,
malnutrition, here with recurrent respiratory distress secondary
to RLL lobar collapse (possible tracheobronchial malacia (TBM)
vs. aspiration with mucous plugging vs HAP) extubated and then
reintubated.

#.  Respiratory failure:
The patient had recurrent lobar collapse with respiratory
distress.  Reportedly has TBM but left sided lesion is too
distal to stent. Has positive glucan/galactomannan, and CT on
[**4-14**] showing diffuse disease, possibly invasive aspergilliosis.
She was started on oral voriconazole on [**2190-4-15**], but with
elevated LFT??????s to the thousands, voriconazole was discontinued
and ambisome was started. Voriconazole was restarted on
[**2190-4-24**] and again she had elevated LFT??????s. This may have been
due to repeat shock liver however Voriconazole was again
discontinued and Ambisome was restarted. On [**2190-4-29**], the patient
had continually dropping platlets, thought to be due to Ambisome
so this was discontinued and Micafungin started until LFT??????s come
down at which point, plan was to start Voriconazole again. She
had already completed a course for HAP with Vancomycin and
Cefepime on [**4-17**]. Due to multiple respiratory problems, the
patient ultimately required another intubation overnight ([**4-26**])
which she agreed to. Ultimately, CVVH was discontinued due to
clot and so the ability to remove fluid to help with respiratory
issues was lost. The patient was noted again to have MRSA
growing in sputum, and was started back on vancomycin for MRSA
on sputum from [**4-27**]. Meropenem was also started at this time. ID
followed the patient and recommended switching Micafungin back
to Voriconazole when possible. After discussion with the family,
the decision was made to make the patient comfort measures only
(CMO) and all antibiotics were discontinued on [**2190-5-2**].

#. HTN/Hypotension:
The patient was on nitropaste and amlodipine at home. For some
time, she was on Captopril and Amlodipine here, however switched
to single [**Doctor Last Name 360**] beta-blocker given rhythm issues.  In the ICU
she continued to have labile blood pressure.  Significant labile
BP??????s with hemodialysis (HD) requiring Phenylephrine as well as
periodic Levophed and fluid boluses for BP support. Utlimately,
her hypotension became a barrier to HD and she was initiated on
CVVH. This had to be discontinued on [**5-1**] due to clot formation.
The patient was unable to tolerate heparin, and had become
citrate toxic.

#.  Thrombocytopenia:
The patient's platelets had dropped acutely from 118 to 69 to 50
on [**2190-4-30**]. The was possibly due to Amphoterocin which was
briefly discontinued previously and platelets went up. Ambisome
was discontinued again due to dropping platlets, and the
pla
