Admission Date:  [**2177-11-25**]       Discharge Date:  [**2177-11-26**]

Date of Birth:   [**2107-11-9**]       Sex:  F

Service:  MICU-GREEN

REASON FOR ADMISSION:  The patient was transferred from
outside hospital (Vent-Core), because of acute renal failure
as well as a new serious rash.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 70 year old woman with
a history of breast cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, severe refractory hypertension, type 2 diabetes
mellitus, and chronic renal insufficiency who presents from
[**Hospital 103101**] Rehabilitation, followed there by the Pulmonary
Interventional Fellow, [**Name (NI) **] [**Name8 (MD) **], M.D., with a
desquamating rash, serum eosinophilia as well as recent acute
renal failure.  The patient was discharged to this
rehabilitation from [**Hospital1 69**] in
[**2177-7-10**].  Prior to the admission to [**Hospital1 346**] Medical Intensive Care Unit from
[**7-3**] until [**2177-8-1**], she was also here in early
[**Month (only) **] as well.

In the first admission, she was admitted for a chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease flare and was noted to have
bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusions with
tamponade physiology.  This was tapped under ultrasound
guidance and found to be exudative with negative cytology and
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] of 1.160.  She was then readmitted nine days later
with shortness of breath again, thought to be a chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease flare and was treated with
nebulizers, Lasix and Solu-Medrol.  She was found to have
tamponade physiology on a transthoracic echocardiogram,
underwent balloon pericardiotomy and intubated for airway
protection.  An ultrasound guided thoracentesis on [**7-4**]
for a left pleural effusion which was found to be
transudative was performed and the patient was extubated
successfully.  Five days later, both the pleural effusion and
the pericardial effusions reaccumulated requiring
re-intubation on [**7-9**].  The patient went to the Operating
Room for a pericardial window, a left chest tube and a left
pleurodesis.  After this, she was unable to extubate and was
then returned to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

Failure to wean in the Medical Intensive Care Unit was
secondary to diaphragmatic weakness and she was noted to have
critical care polyneuropathy/myopathy per EMG on [**2177-7-24**].  She underwent tracheotomy on [**2177-7-17**].  The
cause of the pleural and pericardial effusions are unknown.
The work-up was basically negative; there were no malignant
cells found in either of the fluids and the pericardial
window biopsy was negative.  Also, Rheumatology evaluated her
and thought it was not secondary to a rheumatological cause
because her admission [**Doctor First Name **] on [**7-6**] was negative (however,
she had positive [**Doctor First Name **] on [**2177-7-25**] times two).  Her
Pulmonary status improved and the effusions remained stable
so she was discharged to Vent-Core on [**2177-8-1**].

She did well at the rehabilitation and her course there was
actually unknown to us at this point, however, we do know
that she was unable to be weaned off of her ventilator.  She
was currently on CMV with a total volume of 500, respiratory
rate of 12 and an FIO2 of 40% and had recently failed a PS
trial secondary to tachypnea and low volume.

Recent events at the rehabilitation are summarized below:  We
know that she recently finished a course of Vancomycin and
cefepime on [**11-17**], which was begun empirically
secondary to a fever.  At this time, we do not know the
length of time she was on either of these antibiotics.

She was recently restarted on Lisinopril on approximately
[**11-16**].  She does have a history of her creatinine going
up on ACE inhibitors in the past, however, she was having
blood pressures up to the 240s and an attempt was made to
restart her on Lisinopril which she had not been on since
[**Month (only) 216**].

Her creatinine upon discharge from [**Hospital1 190**] ranged from 1.0 to 1.5.  She briefly had some
elevations of the creatinine into the 2.4 range secondary to
acute renal failure from intravenous contrast.  They
restarted the Lisinopril at 10, went up to 20, and
discontinued her Lisinopril on [**11-20**], as her creatinine
had started to rise.  It was 3.2 on [**11-21**] and then
increased to 3.6 at the outside hospital on [**11-24**].

Renal did evaluate her while she was at the rehabilitation
and they suggested dialysis as well as an increase in her
Lasix.  She did not undergo dialysis at that time.  Then, on
[**11-21**], a rash was noted to have started that was
initially limited and mild but then she underwent
desquamation of her skin associated with diffuse erythema and
edema.  She was also noted to have an eosinophilia since
[**2177-10-17**].  We know that her serum eosinophils were
16% on [**11-19**] and had decreased to 12% on [**11-24**].
Of note, she had also been on Prednisone for an unknown
reason.  At the rehabilitation it was decided to start
weaning this down from 10 mg to 5 mg one week ago.

According to the physicians that took care of her at the
rehabilitation, her only new medications were Lisinopril from
approximately [**11-16**] until [**11-20**].  She had been
previously on that but not since [**Month (only) 216**].  She was also
recently started on Amlodipine however, it was related that
this was started on [**11-22**], after the rash had appeared.
All her other hypertensive medications she had been on for
quite some time, and the only other recent medications were
her antibiotics, Vancomycin and Cefepime, that were
discontinued on [**11-17**], when the course was finished.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient can nod her head with
responses and denied pain and shortness of breath at time of
admission.
