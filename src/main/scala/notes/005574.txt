Chief Complaint:
ICD firing /occ. lightheadedness


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2169-8-31**]
1. Redo sternotomy and ventricular tachycardia ablation
    using epicardial ventricular radiofrequency ablation.
2. Ventricular tachycardia mapping


History of Present Illness:
73 year old male that presented to
the ED [**7-14**] with complaints of ICD firing multiple times.
He had recently been admitted for GAS bacteremia which he was
started on ceftriaxone which was changed this admission due to
concern of drug induced neutropenia.
He continued to have ventricular tachycardia episodes in the
hospital and underwent attempted ablations for Ventricular
tachycardia on [**7-17**] and [**7-20**] with EP - that were not successful.
He completed a course of antibiotics on [**7-26**] and PICC was
removed
after tPA injection in the ICU on [**7-27**]. RUE DVT noted. Bridged
with lovenox and coumadin restarted. Presents today for further
planning for surgery.Now off abx for 13 days. Reports no fevers.
He has been at [**Hospital 9188**] Rehab since discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] with
planned discharge to home in a few days.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus in the LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dilated RA. A catheter or
pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD
by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Mild global RV free
wall hypokinesis.

AORTA: Severe dilation of aorta at sinus level. Normal ascending
aorta diameter. Mildly dilated aortic arch. Mildly dilated
descending aorta.

well seated, normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular
gradients.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Trivial
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflet.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. No TEE related complications. The rhythm appears to
be A-V paced. Results were personally reviewed with the MD
caring for the patient.

REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:





     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
The left atrium is dilated. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial
appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. The right atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect
is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
There is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction
with preserved function in anterior, anteroseptal and
inferoseptal walls..
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global
free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic root is severely dilated at the sinus level. The
aortic arch is mildly dilated. The descending thoracic aorta is
mildly dilated.
A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic
valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc
motion and transvalvular gradients. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the results before surgery
start.

After postbypass, on epinephrine 0.02 mcg/kg/min
Mild global RV systolic function.
LVEF 25%.
Mild TR.
Trivial MR.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr.[**Known lastname 99580**] is a 73 year old male with ventricular tachycardia
that was unable to be ablated in EP lab and referred for
epicardial ablation. He was seen in clinic and preoperative
testing was performed.He was advised to take his last dose of
coumadin [**8-25**] and he was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for IV
heparin/cardiac cath/carotid US/PATs on [**8-29**].
On [**2169-8-31**] he was taken to the operating room and underwent a
Redo sternotomy and ventricular tachycardia ablation using
epicardial ventricular ra
