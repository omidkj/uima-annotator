Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxic respiratory failure, R hip fracture

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p ORIF of R hip

History of Present Illness:
78 yo male w/ hx of COPD on home O2 (5-6 L, w/ O2 sats in mid
80s) who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] following a respiratory
arrest. Patient was first seen at OSH following a fall on his R
hip, initial read of plain film was neg for fracture. Apparently
patient was leaving the hospital AMA and on transferring from
wheelchair to car, collapsed in the parking lot. He was
intubated in the ED. CXR w/ bilateral lower lobe opacities so he
was started on levofloxacin, vancomycin, and flagyl.
.
While vented patient found to be hypoxemic w/ PaO2 47-53 on FiO2
100%. He was bolused w/ IVF, however, eventually required blood
pressure support and was started on a dopamine gtt. It was
unclear if the pneumonia was the sole cause of such severe
hypoxia. An echo demonstrated pulmonary artery hypertension, a
hypokinetic RV free wall, LVEF WNL. Given hypotension and
hypoxia, there was concern that he may have a PE. LENIS were
negative. Patient was briefly on a heparin gtt for presumed PE
but this was stopped prior to transfer.
.
On a CTA done in [**2125**], there was note of an anomalous left
pulmonary vein which connects to the left brachiocephalic vein.
The triple-lumen catheter had been placed in [**Last Name (un) 9888**] area; serial
VBG's and the prior CTA report suggested that the triple lumen
catheter was drawing blood from the in the left upper lobe
pulmonary vein.
.
Ultimately, family decided to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
work-up as patient's pulmonologist is [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 575**]. On
arrival to the ICU, he underwent bronchoscopy which did not show
large amounts of frank mucous. BAL performed.

PT: 12.0  PTT: 33.1  INR: 1.0
CXR - [**2-7**]:
1. Diffuse alveolar airspace opacity within the right mid- and
lower lung zones is concerning for a diffuse pneumonia, although
aspiration or asymmetric pulmonary edema are also diagnostic
considerations.
2. Left lower lobe collapse, as before.
3. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube appear appropriately
positioned.
**
CT pelvis- [**2-8**]:
1. Impacted right femoral neck fracture. This was discussed with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1852**] at 4 p.m. on [**2129-2-8**].
2. L4 compression fracture.
3. Left common iliac artery aneurysm.
**
CT chest- [**2-8**]:
1. Severe emphysema.
2. Left lower lobe pneumonia.
3. Possible three other small areas of infection in the right
lung but neoplastic origin of this finding cannot be excluded.
Please follow up in three months with chest CT.
4. Known left upper lobe anomalous venous drainage into left
brachiocephalic vein; thus the central line is in the pulmonary
venous system .
5. Coronary calcifications and aortic valve calcifications,
unchanged.
6. Stable hypodense liver lesion is most likely cysts.
**
CT Chest - [**2-8**]:
1. Pulmonary edema.
2. Total collapse of the left lower lobe with obstruction of the
left lower lobe bronchus most likely due to mucus plugging given
the short interval of appearance, less likely due to compression
or endobronchial lesion.
3. Moderate - severe emphysema.
4. Focal nodular areas in the right lung should be reevaluated
after pulmonary edema resolves, neoplastic origin cannot be
totally excluded.
5. Coronary calcifications and aortic valve calcifications,
unchanged.
6. ET tube at the carina needs to pulled back [**3-20**] cms for
appropriate positioning.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hypoxic respiratory failure: Patient arrived from OSH intubated;
when trying to leave the OSH he had an hypoxic respiratory event
which required emergency intubation. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
at the request of the family as he was followed here by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 575**], his primary pulmonologist. His respiratory failure
was multifactorial; pneumonia and severe COPD were the most
prominent factors during this event. Additionally, patient had
evidence of L --> R shunt given anomalous L brachiocephalic/L
pulmonary vein anastomosis. Respiratory distress was further
compounded by R --> L shunt through the diseased lung. ECHO @
[**Hospital1 **]- [**Location (un) 620**] showed mild RV hypokinesis. BNP was WNL. Patient had
an ECHO with a bubble study performed at [**Hospital1 18**], which was
negative for ASD. Patient was covered broadly with vancomycin
and cefepime for his pneumonia and started on steroids,
albuterol and ipratropium for COPD exacerbation. He was treated
with antibiotics for ten days. During his hospitalization,
multiple attempts were made to decrease his respiratory support
on the ventilator. Patient was briefly able to tolerate a
pressure support mode of ventilation but ultimately had to go
back on AC when he became increasingly hypoxic. Patient was
intubated for a total of fourteen days and team had multiple
discussions with family about his ongoing care and prognosis. On
the day prior to extubation, patient underwent bilateral
thoracenteses in an attempt to optimize his pulmonary function.
The family agreed that he would not want to undergo a
tracheostomy and decided that we should attempt to extubate him
with the understanding that his prognosis was poor and he may
not survive off the ventilator. They also decided he should not
be reintubated.  Prior to his extubation, we attempted to
further diurese him by starting him on a nitro gtt and giving
him a combination of blood and furosemide. Patient was extubated
on [**2129-2-19**] with the family at the bedside.  He initially was able
to breath on his own and maintain his oxygenation, however, he
soon became tired. His respiratory distress was managed with
fentanyl and midazolam. The patient ultimately expired at 3:20
pm on [**2129-2-19**]. His family was present.
.
R hip fracture:  Patient was taken to the OR on [**2129-2-11**] for ORIF
of his R hip.  He tolerated the procedure with minimal
complications.  As noted above, he remained on the ventilator
before and after his surgery.  Following his surgery, his wound
remained intact and free of infection.
