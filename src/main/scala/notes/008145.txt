Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2184-2-5**] Coronary artery bypass grafting x4 - left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and
reverse saphenous vein graft to the ramus intermedius artery
[**2184-2-3**] Cardiac catheterization


History of Present Illness:
46 year old male who has been followed since [**2180**] for a history
of cardiomyopathy with an EF in 40% range. He has been medically
managed and doing well. In [**11/2183**] he underwent angioplasty of
his left superficial femoral artery at [**Hospital3 **]. Since then he
has had daily episodes of shooting pain in his right and left
chest (usually occuring at rest) lasting seconds and resolving
spontaneously. He denies any other symptoms even with activity.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5310**] scheduled him for cardiac catherization which
showed Left main disease. He is now being consulted for surgical
revascularization.

CHEST (PA & LAT)   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 86546**]

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
   46 year old man with CABg
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
   interval chnage in left effusion



Final Report
CHEST

HISTORY: Evaluate for change in left effusion. Status post CABG.


Two views. Comparison with the previous study done [**2184-2-7**].
There is streaky
density bilaterally consistent with subsegmental atelectasis, as
before.
There is new blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus consistent
with a small
effusion. The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG
as before.
Mediastinal structures are essentially unchanged. The bony
thorax is grossly
intact.

IMPRESSION: Evidence for accumulation of a small amount of
pleural fluid on
the left. Otherwise no significant change.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size.
Low normal LVEF. TDI E/e' < 8, suggesting normal PCWP (<12mmHg).
No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta. Mildly dilated aortic arch.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AR.

Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50-55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
