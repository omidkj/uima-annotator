Studies:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2191-8-9**] 9:43 PM
FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH: Study is slightly limited by motion
artifact. Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear grossly
unremarkable allowing for portable technique. Increased
interstital opacities are noted, consistent with
mild-to-moderate CHF. No focal consolidations are seen. No
definite pleural effusions identified.

IMPRESSION: Slightly limited by motion artifact.
Mild-to-moderate CHF.
*
BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS  [**2191-8-10**] 12:42 PM
FINDINGS: Grayscale and color Doppler imaging of the common
femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed
bilaterally. The right common femoral vein only partially
compresses and likely has non- occlusive thrombus within. The
superficial femoral vein does not compress and no demonstrable
flow is seen within. The right popliteal vein compresses and
demonstrates normal flow.

Likely non-occlusive thrombus is also identified within the left
common femoral vein though normal compressibility and flow is
seen within the left superficial femoral and popliteal veins.

IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombus within the common femoral
vein bilaterally. Occlusive thrombus likely within the right
superficial femoral vein.
*
ECHO [**2191-8-10**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 11-15mmHg.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated. Right ventricular systolic
function is borderline normal. Interventricular septal motion is
normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-23**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened.  Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal LVEF. Dilated RV with borderline normal
systolic function.  Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.
These findings suggest chronic pulmonary hypertension. No
findings of acute, massive pulmonary embolism are suggested.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital for a CHF exacerbation. You
were initially treated with some supplemental oxygen and Lasix
to imrove your urine output. In addition, a study showed that
you clots in your veins in the legs and you were started on
heparin and than transitioned to Coumadin.

You will need to get routine checks of your INR which will help
monitor your coumadin level. You will need to be checked in 2
days and then every 3 days thereafter.

If you are feeling short of breath or having any chest pain,
please return to the ED for further management
