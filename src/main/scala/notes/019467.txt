Brief Hospital Course:
She was transferred from OSH with atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response.
1. Afib: Etiology felt to be seocndary to volume depletion as
she was given kayexalate at OSH which resulted in diarrhea. She
was given IVF for volume repletion. She was started on a
diltiazem drip to control her HR. EP service was consulted for
possible need for pacemaker. She was transitioned to oral
metoprolol and diltiazem. EP felt she did not need pacemaker or
ablation at this time.
2. ARF: Her creatinine had normalized at time of transfer and
was felt to be prerenal. We monitored her fluid status. She was
sent home on a lower dose of lasix 40 mg versus 60 mg daily.
3. UTI: COntinued ciprofloxacin for 7 day course.
