History of Present Illness:
65 year old woman who came to the ED in [**Location (un) 620**] with dyspnea,
dysuria and bony pain. She was essentially healthy until 2 weeks
ago when she developed symptoms of urinary burning and also
developed problems with fatigue. However, she was able to
function normally and then a few days ago developed significant
[**Last Name **] problem and had been using some Advil and bone compresses.
The problem continued with significant fatigue over the past 24
hours and she came to the emergency room. She was also feeling
mild degree of dyspnea, which was relieved with a nonrebreathing
mask.
Her exam was notable for tachycardia and peripheral cyanosis.
She was also found to have severe uterine prolapse. She denied
any symptoms of chest pain, back pain or abdominal pain. She was
started on Levofloxacin, Gentamicin and Flagyl. Her respiratory
status worsened over few hours and she was intubated (AC, RR26,
FiO2 39, PEEP 5, TV450). Her blood gas showed a ph 7.31, pCO2
32, pO2 221, HCO3 15.6. Her CXR was suggestive for ARDS. She
also developped acute renal failure with a Creatinine of 4.0.
Her systolic blood pressure was found to be in the fifties. She
was given 7 liters of fluid and was started on Levophed and
Vasopressin. She was admitted to the MICU with the diagnosis of
urospesis.  An A-line  and a RJ-central line was placed. The was
Pt was found to have an elevated troponin 141 > 200 and CK 1300
> 1700 without apparent EKG-changes. She was started on Aspirin,
Heparin gtt and Plavix. Her blood gas at that time showed a pH
of 7.3, pCO2 17, PO2 119, HCO3 8.4. She was given 2amp of
bicarbonate and received more Bicarbonate ? on the transfer to
[**Hospital1 18**]. Her second showed worsened pulmoary edema. The urine
culture grew out E.coli and Proteus mirabilis. Her blood culture
was positive for gram-negative rods,presumptive E.coli,
pan-sensitive. The pt was started on Rocephin 2mg [**Hospital1 **] and all
other Abx were discontinued. An US  of the abdomen showed:
multiple non-obstructive calculi in the left kidney and bladder,
small echogenic left kidney and cholelithiasis. The pt also
experienced one episode of Vtach 5 beats, but was asymptomatic.
The VS at that time were T 100.2, HR 80s, CVP 11. She was given
2 L of fluids in the ICU.
The decision was made to tranfer her to the [**Hospital1 18**]. She received
11 L up to now.

hemorrhoids.

Conclusion> multiple non-obstructive calculi in the left kidney
and bladder, small echogenic left kidney and cholelithiasis.
..
CXR [**8-4**]: Cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  There is pulmonary
edema.  No  definite pleural effusion identified.
..
Micro
Urine [**8-4**]: E coli >100,000, proteus <10,000
Bld [**8-4**]: 2 type of gm neg; first if pan-sensitive E coli
..
CT [**8-6**]:
1.  Moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions with reactive
atelectasis.
2.  Left non-obstructing renal stones.  Atrophic and cortical
scarring seen
within the left kidney.  No evidence of hydronephrosis or
hypoattenuating
areas to indicate an abscess on this limited study in the
kidneys bilaterally.
3.  Anasarca, periportal edema and gallbladder wall edema
consistent with
fluid third spacing.  Gallstones.
4.  Bladder calculi.  The bladder appears slightly distended
with a small
amount of intravesicular air, likely iatrogenic from Foley
placement.
..
Echo [**8-7**]: Mild biventricular hypokinesis c/w cardiomyopathy:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild global left ventricular hypokinesis. There is mild global
right ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
..
CT Abdomen [**8-10**]:
1.  Right pyelonephritis. At least two renal infarcts which
could be related
to pyelonephritis although embolic sources should be
investigated.
2.  Atrophic left kidney with a large calculus in a renal calix.
Mildly
dilated left ureter without evidence of an obstructing stone.
3.  Gallstones.
4.  Bilateral pleural effusions.
..
Echo [**8-11**]
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect or
patent
foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast
with maneuvers.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
3. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
4. No echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis seen.
..
Cytology ([**2102-8-17**])
DIAGNOSIS: Pleural fluid:ATYPICAL.

One cluster of atypical mesothelial cells, probably
reactive, in a background of mesothelial cells.
..
Bedside Swallow Evaluation ([**2102-8-15**])
SUMMARY / IMPRESSION:
There were no signs of aspriation on her bedside swallowing
evaluation today. She appears safe to take a full PO diet as
tolerated as long as she is seated fully upright in bed.

CXR: (multiple CXRs previous - to follow effusions, lines)
Portable AP view of the chest dated [**2102-8-18**] at 19:14 is compared
with the same examination from 2 hours earlier. The right
internal jugular centralvenous catheter has been removed. There
has been interval withdrawal of the right PICC line, which now
