Brief Hospital Course:
Patient with Hep C/ETOH cirrhosis on transplant list with
adnexal masses found during transplant workup. Patient admitted
day before surgery for prep. In addition she received blood
products (6 u plt, 1u FFP prior to surgery and intra-op; 1u plt,
2u FFP)
Surgery was performed by Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2028**]. Please see the
operative note for details. In summary: she underwent a
diagnostic laparoscopy, exploratory laparotomy, lysis of
adhesions, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. There were  no
palpable vaginal or parametrial nodularity noted. On exploratory
laparoscopy,
there was about a liter and a half of ascites on entering the
abdomen. The liver edge was cobblestone. There were no adhesions
in the upper abdomen . The only adhesions within the abdomen or
pelvis were in the posterior cul-de-sac where both ovaries
adhered the rectosigmoid to the posterior surface of the uterus.
These were extremely dense adhesions that did not come down
easily and could not be removed
laparoscopically, laparotomy performed. Patient was extubated in
the OR, stable on transfer to the PACU.
Post op the patient had low urine output. Given history of
ascites and elevated INR she was receiving albumin and FFP.
Urine output would increase transiently following colloids and
then fall back.
Patient was transferred to the SICU on [**4-5**] (POD 3) and started
on Midodrine, Octreotide and albumin. Urine output at 20-40
cc/hr but also recorded at < 10cc/hr. Creatinine stable at 1.2
(baseline 0.9) Transferred to Transplant and Hepatology until
time of discharge, with GYN following.
Patient had periods of slow speaking, somnolence both prior to
and following surgery. Lactulose was restarted for
encephalopathy in addition to Lasix for fluid management.
Patient stabilized, urine output improved and patient
transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 10 on [**4-8**]. She continued to be follwed by
GYN, who removed staples on [**4-9**].
Abdominal wound opened and decision made to initiate NS wet to
dry dressings which the patient will continue at home.
She will complete a 10 day course of Augmentin and then switch
back to her prophylactic Cipro at home.
Biopsy shows:
- Right ovary and fallopian tube: Ovary with endometrioma,
simple cysts and multiple adhesions; no malignancy is
identified. Unremarkable fallopian tube.
- Left ovary and fallopian tube: Ovary with endometriosis, focal
adhesion formation and simple cyst. Fallopian tube with rare
endometriotic implants.
Since no malignancy is identified she will be placed back on
liver transplant waiting list.
