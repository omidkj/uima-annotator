Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Intubation

History of Present Illness:
67 yo female with CHF/COPD d/c'd on [**8-22**] after hospitalization
for CHF and UTI who presented to ED on [**2119-9-26**] with flash
pulmonary edema likely secondary to hypertensive emergency
requiring intubation for hypoxic respiratory failure and found
to have a persistent UTI. The patient denied CP, f/c, n/v. No
home 02 requirement.
.
At presentation in the [**Name (NI) **], pt was persistently hypoxic to the
70s despite increasing oxygenation. She was placed on nitro gtt
for inital BPs >200 [**3-18**] medication noncompliance. Max BP in ED
257/108. She was also given CTX/levaquin for question of PNA on
CXR along with + UA, IV steroids, nebs, and lasix. Her BNP was
elevated at ~7000. After stabilization, the patient was
transferred to the MICU.
.
MICU COURSE. Captopril and hydralazine were added to her home BP
regimen, and nitro drip was weaned off on [**9-28**]. She was diuresed
2L over length of stay with IV lasix. She was extubated on
[**2119-9-28**]. She was found to have an E.coli UTI. She was continued
on ceftriaxone. There was concern regarding her mental status
while intubated. A head CT was performed and was unremarkable.
.
At time of MICU call-out, she denied SOB, chest pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea. No orthopnea or PND. She reported feeling as
though her respiratory status was at baseline.

Imaging:
EKG [**9-26**]: Sinus rhythm. Short P-R interval. Mild Q-T interval
prolongation. Since the previous tracing of [**2119-8-20**] atrial
premature beats are no longer seen.

CXR [**9-26**]:  The exam is technically
limited by patient rotation. However, the left hemidiaphragm is
obscured by a region of increased opacity at the left lung base,
which could reflect
atelectasis. Overall, the pulmonary vasculature is engorged,
with diffusely
increased parenchymal opacity, consistent with mild-moderate
edema.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette remains markedly enlarged,
overall unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Cervical spine
fusion hardware is stable. Soft tissue and bony structures are
otherwise unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Moderate pulmonary edema.

CT head [**9-28**]: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, masses,
mass effect or infarction. The ventricles and sulci are normal
in caliber and configuration. No fractures are identified.
CONCLUSION: Normal study.

[**10-1**]: The patient has been extubated. The film is less rotated
and in a
slightly more lordotic position. There is no focal consolidation
and the
lateral CP angles are sharply delineated. Pulmonary vascular
markings are
normal. Mild cardiomegaly is demonstrated. Some prominence of
the right
paratracheal soft tissues may be related to tortuous vessels.
IMPRESSION: No obvious radiographic explanation for fever
spikes.


Brief Hospital Course:
67F with diastolic CHF, COPD, HTN, RA transferred out of the
MICU after brief intubation for respiratory failure due to
hypertensive emergency also found to have resistant E.coli UTI.
.
## Respiratory Failure: Acute onset hypoxic respiratory failure.
PNA unlikely with lack of sputum production, cough, clear CXR.
PE unlikely despite remote history of PE as patient is not
hypotensive or tachycardic. History most consistent with flash
pulmonary edema in the setting of known diastolic dysfunction.
The patient was diuresed, her BP controlled with multiple meds
including a nitro drip and she was successfully extubated
morning of [**9-29**]. She was weaned off oxygen and tolerated sats in
the low 90s on room air.
.
## Hypertension:  BP meds were adjusted to create the easiest
dosing schedule. I
