Neurologically visual fields are full to confrontation.  Her
pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.  Her cranial
nerves are intact.  Her motor strength is [**4-14**] in all muscle
groups.  Her reflexes are 2+ throughout.  She has got no
ankle clonus.  Sensation through touch intact in the arms and
legs.  Cerebellar, finger-to-nose, heel-to-shin, and rapid
alternating movements with finger-to-toe tapping were intact

wide based and normal initiation.  Her stride is slightly
dragging and arm swinging.  Tandem walking was unsteady with
falls to the left.

The patient had a head CT scan which showed left subdural
hematoma which was drained at the bedside.  Repeat head CT
scan in the morning showed residual left subdural hematoma
without midline shift.

The patient continued to have severe headaches, therefore the
patient was taken to the operating room.  On [**2136-10-25**] head CT
scan was essentially unchanged.  The patient's subdural
hematoma was slightly smaller in size in the left frontal
area.  Midline shift was slightly improved.  Ventricles were
open without evidence of obstruction or hydrocephalus.

The patient was taken to the operating room and had open
craniotomy for drainage of a subdural hematoma on [**2136-10-25**]
without intraop complications.  Patient was awake, alert, and
oriented times three.  Pupils were equal and reactive three
down to 2.5 mm.  Motor strength is [**4-14**] in all muscle groups
and incision was clean, dry, and intact.

On [**10-26**], the patient was alert, following commands with 5/5
strength in bilateral upper extremities with no eye opening.
Pupils were 4 down to 3 on the left; and three down to two on
the right.  Patient had a head CT scan on [**2136-10-26**] that
showed evidence of no cephalus in the area of operation.

On [**2136-10-26**] the patient was taken to the angio suite and
had a diagnostic angiogram which was negative for any
aneurysms.

On [**2136-10-27**] the patient was difficult to arouse, opened eyes
briefly, follow two-step commands inconsistently.  Was
oriented to the hospital year.  Withdrawal extremities to
pain and localized.  The patient had MRI with diffusion
weighted images which was negative for infarct.  The patient
also had repeat head CT scan on [**2136-10-28**] which showed no
increase in subdural hematoma and no increase in mass effect.
Although patient continued to be sleepy, but arousable.

The patient had two electroencephalograms which showed no
evidence of seizure activity, just evidence of diffuse
slowing.  Patient was treated with Vancomycin for Staph
pneumonia.

On [**2136-11-7**], the patient was re-admitted to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit, where she was intubated electively.  On
[**2136-11-7**], the patient underwent re-evacuation of the right
subdural hematoma.  There were no intraoperative
complications, and the patient was monitored in the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit postop.  She was continued on Mannitol 50
grams IV q six hours.  Neurologically she opened her eyes
spontaneously.  Stated her name and year.  Pupils were three
down to 2.8 mm bilaterally reactive.  EOMs are full.  Follows
commands.  Moving all extremities.  Her dressing was clean,
dry, and intact.

The patient was seen by the Neurology service who recommended
starting the patient on Glycerol in an attempt to reduce
brain edema and continue on Mannitol.

On [**2136-11-12**] the patient was transferred to the regular
floor and continued to have her Mannitol weaned.  Seen by
Speech and Swallow Service, who found that she was aspirating
and recommended more permanent form of feeding.  The patient
had a PEG tube placed on [**2136-11-16**] without complications.
The patient's mental status deteriorated.  The patient became
unarousable with periods of waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**].  Mental status
appeared periods of being awake, and following commands, and
then being obtunded.

She was restarted on Mannitol 50 grams IV q eight hours and
continued on Glycerol and decadron.  Mental status improved.
She is currently discontinued off Mannitol, continues on
Glycerol, and weaning off Decadron.  She was seen by physical
therapy and occupational therapy, and found to acquire rehab
prior to discharge to home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Levofloxacin 500 mg nasogastric q day, Glycerol 25 grams po q
