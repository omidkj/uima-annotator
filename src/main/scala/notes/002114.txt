CT Head [**2187-7-26**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Increased diffuse cerebral edema with partial effacement of
the cisterns and ventricular system and loss of [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
differentiation consistent with diffuse edema, possibly related
to [**Doctor First Name **]. Close clinical followup is recommended. Pl. see above
details regarding inadequate evaluation for tonsillar
herniation.


2. Decreased conspicuity to small right-sided tentorial subdural
hematoma
noted on outside imaging. No regions of subarachnoid hemorrhage
identified on current exam.

CTA neck [**2187-7-26**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Lateral mass/articular facet fracture of C2 with comminuted
right
transverse process fractures at C2, C3, and C4 with right
vertebral artery
caliber change at the C3 and C4 level suspicious for intimal
injury or
dissection. Further delineation can be attempted with MRA neck
if clinically
indicated .

2. Complex unstable appearing comminuted and distracted
posterior element
fractures involving T3 and T4 partially visualized. Comminuted
left scapular body fracture.

3. Increased contusion and/or effusion at the left apex. No
visualized
pneumothorax within the included portions of the upper lungs.


CT Chest/Abdomen [**2187-7-26**]
IMPRESSION:

1. No evidence of active extravasation. This patient is status
post
exploratory laparotomy left open with surgical packing
surrounding the liver

2. Left greater than right pleural effusion and bilateral
atelectasis.

3. Right basilar chest tube, nasogastric tube in standard
positions.

4. Stable appearance of known right renal laceration.

5. Markedly edematous loops of small and large bowel with free
abdominal
fluid and pericholecystic fluid that is suggestive of third
spacing.

6. Replaced left hepatic artery arising from the left gastric
and replaced
right hepatic artery arising from the common hepatic artery
which originates from the SMA.

MRI Cervical/Thoracic Spine [**2187-7-28**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Ligamentum flavum disruption at T2-3 and T3-4 level with
widening of the interspinous distance indicative of flexion
injury with fractures of right superior articular process of T3
and T4 and left superior articular process of T3 and fracture of
the anterior superior portion of T4 vertebra. This combination
of findings indicates an unstable flexion injury at this level.
2. Paraspinal hematoma seen with probable hematoma within the
right side of the spinal canal at T3-4 level with narrowing of
the spinal canal and
displacement of the spinal cord to the left side. The narrowing
also is
contributed by malalignment and displacement of the bony
structures to the
right side of the spinal canal. Although there is an indentation
on the
spinal cord at T3-4 level, no definite increased spinal cord
signal is seen. However, the evaluation is limited secondary to
artifacts and a small area of spinal cord contusion cannot be
excluded.






Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken to the operating room on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] for
exploratory laparotomy and was found to have a grade 4 liver
laceration. His abdomen was packed in order to control the
hemorrhage. He was then taken to the Trauma ICU.

Postoperatively Neurosurgery was consulted and an intracranial
bolt was placed to monitor his ICP. They were consistently in
the range of [**6-6**]. During the first 24 hours he received >30
units of blood products including PRBC's, FFP, platelets, cryo,
and Factor VII. His abdomen was left because of his severe edema
and 3rd spacing. On POD 1 he returned to the OR to remove the
packing and to close his abdomen. His bladder pressures were
closely monitored and remained within the normal range. He was
started on beta blockers for tachycardia and elevated blood
pressures.

Two days later he was taken back to the operating room by
Neurosurgery for posterior fusion of his severe T2-8 fractures.
There were no intraoperative complications. Postoperatively he
was maintained in the hard cervical collar and was taken back to
the Trauma ICU where he remained for another 6-7 days. He was
weaned from sedation and the ventilator and was finally
extubated. He was later transferred to the regular nursing unit.

While on the nursing unit he continued to progress slowly; his
mental status improved significantly over the remainder course
of his stay. His blood pressures were intermittently elevated
and he was continued on his Lopressor. He was tolerating regular
diet and was not reporting any pain issues.

He was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy and was
cleared for home with 24 hour supervision. He was given
prescriptions for outpatient PT and OT.
