blood pressure 170/64, respirations 20, oxygen saturation 98%
on room air, blood sugar greater than 400 on admission.
General:  The patient was alert and oriented.  He was

91/29, 64/8.3, glucose 475; calcium 9.8, magnesium 2.5.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the Operating
Room with the initial diagnosis of end-stage renal disease.
The patient had a cadaveric renal transplant and tolerated
the procedure well.  He was transported to the PACU in stable
condition.

On postoperative day #1, the patient continued his
immunosuppression regimen of Thymoglobulin, Solu-Medrol
taper, Prograf, and CellCept.

On postoperative day #2, the patient's oxygen saturations
began to decrease and intermittently would decrease to as low
as 75%.  The patient was given a total of 240 mg Lasix and
also had his intravenous replacement discontinued.  The
patient had an x-ray which showed no fluid overload and an
infiltrate in the right middle and right lower lobes.  The
chest x-ray was also negative for effusions.  Throughout
postoperative day #2, the patient continued to have
respiratory issues and a low oxygen saturation.  The patient
was subsequently transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for
closer monitoring.

On postoperative day #3, the patient continued with low
oxygen saturations on a non-rebreather and had a chest x-ray
which showed signs of ARDS.  On postoperative day #3, the
patient was also electively intubated for bronchoscopy and
better airway control.

The patient then had a bronchoscopy which showed no hyperemic
areas and did not show excessive pulmonary secretions.  Fluid
samples were taken at the time.  Following bronchoscopy, the
patient was extubated and breathing comfortably for the
remainder of the day.  On the 27th, the patient was
transferred to the floor from the Intensive Care Unit.

On the 28th, the patient continued to do well with an oxygen
saturation of 97% on room air and showed no signs of
respiratory distress.  The patient also had his Foley
discontinued and his central line removed.  The patient on
the 28th with have a Physical Therapy for possible discharge
on the 29th.

DISCHARGE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  T-max 98??????,
heart rate 72, blood pressure 160/70, respirations 18, oxygen
saturation 97% on room air, blood sugars 217-255, p.o. 1300,
IV 100, urine output 2200.  General:  The patient was alert
and oriented.  He was in no acute distress.  Cardiovascular:
Regular, rate and rhythm.  Respiratory:  Clear to

There was a small rash on the right hand at the site near the
day line.  Incision clean, dry, and intact.

DISCHARGE LABORATORY DATA:  White cell count 6.6, hematocrit
29.6; CHEM7 142/48, 107/26, 85/3.4, 139.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post cadaveric renal transplant.
2.  Respiratory distress secondary to possible Thymoglobulin
reaction.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
3.  End-stage renal disease.
4.  Status post left AV fistula in [**2140**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., Zantac 150
mg p.o. b.i.d., Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., CellCept 1 g
