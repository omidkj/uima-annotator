Allergies:
A.C.E Inhibitors

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubation [**2-27**], extubation [**2-28**].

History of Present Illness:
A [**Age over 90 **]yo Russian-speaking F presented from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab on [**2-27**]
with worsening dyspnea x 1 day, found to have BNP=[**Numeric Identifier 56841**],
crackles and rales on exam, hypertension, and a CXR consistent
with volume overload.  Unclear trigger of CHF exacerbation, ?
med or diet non-compliance, but daughter reports that she had
visited Pt. earlier in the evening of admission, and that she
was asymptomatic.  Upon arrival in [**Name (NI) **], Pt. was found to be in
acute respiratory distress. ABG in ED: 7.12/67/83/23.  Pt. was
given IV lasix and a nitro gtt was started.  ABG following
intubation was 7.35/39/219/22 (on A/C 550x14, 100% FiO2 + 5
PEEP).  In MICU, Pt. had episode of hypotension while on nitro
gtt, this was stopped and bp quickly recovered.  Pt. was
diuresed with IV lasix boluses, now on 20mg PO QD. Extubated on
[**2-28**], currently on 2LNC; Pt. is not on home O2.

.
ECG: AV-paced.
.
CXR [**2156-2-28**]: Persistent congestive heart failure with
redistributing, possibly decreasing pulmonary edema, and new
bilateral pleural effusions.
.
TTE [**2156-3-2**]: LVEF=25-30%. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
inferior/inferolateral akinesis, apical akinesis/dyskinesis and
septal akinesis/hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial
effusion.
.
TTE [**9-23**]: LVEF=45%. Left ventricular cavity size is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed.
Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include inferior
akinesis, inferoseptal akinesis/hypokinesis, and inferolateral
hypokinesis. The apical lateral and apical septal segments also
appear hypokinetic. The right ventricular cavity may be mildly
dilated; free wall motion is not fully visualized. The aortic
valve is not well seen; leaflets appear mildly to moderately
thickened (gradient not assessed). No aortic regurgitation is
seen in focused views. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen in focused
views. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Cath [**9-23**]: 1. 3VD. 2. Elevated systemic pressures. 3.
Successful stenting of the acutely occluded RCA.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]yoF with 3VD and CHF, Afib, SSS with AV-PM, p/w 1d dyspnea
likely [**1-22**] CHF exacerbation, s/p intubation.
.
# CHF: CXR consistent with volume overload and BNP very
elevated, likely [**1-22**] diastolic dysfunction (EF 25-30%) and
possible med/diet non-compliance. TTE results indicate diffuse
myocardial dysfuction, possibly secondary to LAD closure leading
to anterior/apical akinesis/dyskinesis.  Pt. is already on
coumadin. Treatment options were discussed with family
(including intervention for revascularization), and decision was
made for medical management.  Therefore, toprol XL dose and
lasix dose were increased, and spironolactone was initiated to
optimize cardiac function. Her [**Last Name (un) **] was also continued, and the
dose of this can be increased in the future, if her bp will
tolerate.
.
# CAD: was ruled out for MI upon admission, but TTE consistent
with ? new WMAs (akinesis/dyskinesis).  Continued on ASA,
plavix, statin, BB, [**Last Name (un) **].
.
# Afib: AV-paced, on BB and amiodarone, and coumadin (goal
INR>2.0), currently in NSR.
.
# CRI: baseline Cr elevation (high 1s - low 2s), currently at
baseline.  urine output and Is/Os were monitored.
Low-Na/cardiac diet was encouraged.
.
# anemia: [**1-22**] renal dx, tends to run in low 30s. will monitor
and tranfuse (with extra diuresis given CHF) for goal Hct>30
given CAD.  Hct stable.  Pt. on epogen at home, will resume at
ECF.
.
# hypothyroidism: continue synthroid.
.
# ID: blood cx NGTD. u/a negative.
.
# FEN: low-Na diet, monitor and replete electrolytes, MVI.
.
# Ppx: PPI, coumadin for Afib, heparin SC, bowel reg.
.
# Comm: with Pt. and daughter (Home [**Telephone/Fax (1) 110810**]; Work
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 110811**]; Cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 110812**]).
