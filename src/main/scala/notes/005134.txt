History of Present Illness:
51 YO F w ESLD [**1-8**] HCV and septic hip who presented to an
outpatient appt for reclast at which time she was noted to have
a BP in the 70s. The patient was feeling well until the night
prior to presentation when she had several loose bowel movements
without blood. She slept last night and awoke this am feeling
nauseous. She ate 1 bite of breakfast and vomited nonbloody
gastric contents. She denied any fever, chills, or shortness of
breath. She was scheduled for an outpatient Reclast infusion so
was picked up by an ambulance for transport at which time EMTs
noted her SBP to be in the 70s. The patient insisted on going to
her appt rather than the ED. At her appt she was again noted to
have SBPs in the 70s so was transported to the ED.
.
In the ED, patient was triggered for an initial BP of 73/43. She
was given 2L NS without effect. A femoral CVL was placed and she
was given vanc, zosyn, hydrocort, and norepi with improvement in
her SBPs to the 100s-120s. Her labs returned notable for WBCs
7.8 with 23% bands, creat 1.5, K 6.6 and lactate 3.7. U/A was
negative for evidence of UTI. Blood and urine cultures were
drawn. EKG revealed peaked T waves so she was given insulin,
dextrose, bicarb, and Ca gluconate. K went from 6.6 to 5.5. She
is was noted to be very sleepy but arousable and able to protect
her airway. CXR was c/w a retrocardiac opacity. VS prior to
transfer were: 101/65 85-90 16 93% RA.
.
On the floor, the patient reports feeling better. She does
complain of bilateral lower abdominal pain. Her mother says she
is still not at her baseline but is much improved since arriving
at the ED; most specifically, she is much less lethargic.
.
Review of sytems:

gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or
congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain
or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting,
constipation. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or myalgias.

MICRO:
Blood Cx ([**7-2**]): Pseudomonas aeurginosa
Urine Cx ([**7-2**]): no growth
Stool Cx ([**7-2**]): no C. diff, Salmonella, Shigella, or
Campylobacter
Blood Cx ([**7-4**], [**7-5**], [**7-6**], [**7-7**]): no growth

CMV viral load ([**7-8**]): not detected
Stool Cx ([**7-8**]): no C. diff, Cryptosporidium, or Giardia
.
IMAGING:
Portable CXR ([**7-2**]): 1. LLL consolidation, worrisome for PNA
with possible superimposed atelectasis. 2. Right pleural
effusion and increased interstitial markings reflecting mild
pulmonary edema.
.
Abdominal U/S ([**7-3**]): Minimal amount of intra-abdominal ascites.
The amount of fluid within the abdominal quadrants would be a
high-risk procedure even for a diagnostic aspiration and we
would recommend deferral of attempting sampling at this time.
.
PA&LAT CXR ([**7-3**]): Chronic bilateral pleural effusions and
bibasilar opacities/atelectasis, possibly due to chronic
aspiration. Increased left retrocardiac consolidation is again
worrisome for pneumonia.
.
RUQ U/S ([**7-3**]): 1. Unchanged cirrhotic-appearing liver, without
suspicious hepatic lesion or intrahepatic fluid collection to
suggest abscess. 2. Contracted gallbladder related to recent
meal. Biliary sludge and stable cholelithiasis but no findings
of acute cholecystitis.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis w/ contrast ([**7-4**]): 1. Patchy opacity in the
right lung base may represent aspiration or infection. 2. Small
bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive
atelectasis, underlying infection not excluded. 3. Findings
compatible with cirrhosis and portal HTN. 4. Wall edema in the
distal rectum suggestive of proctitis.
.
Mandible XR ([**7-9**]): Patchy osteopenia of the mandible. Multiple
erosions.

Brief Hospital Course:
51 year old woman with HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS in [**2153**], which has
been c/b encephalopathy, thrombocytopenia, ascites, hydrothorax,
and multiple infections, and septic right hip who presented to
an outpatient appointment for reclast at which time she was was
noted to be hypotensive and confused, and was sent to the ED.
Please see admission note for further details. Brief hospital
course by problem:
.
# Sepsis: The pt presented with vomiting, hypotension, and
altered mental status and was found to have 7.8 WBCs with 23%
bands. U/A was negative and urine culutures showed no growth. A
CXR revealed a LLL consolidation suspicious for PNA, however the
pt denied respiratory symptoms and was not hypoxic. An abdominal
U/S revealed an unchanged cirrhotic-appearing liver, w/o
evidence of abscess or ascites. An abdominal CT revealed wall
edema in the distal rectum suggestive of proctitis. She was
empirically treated for SBP with vanco, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin
and received albumin. Blood cultures came back positive for
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however no source was identified.
Antibiotics were narrowed to cefepime to cover Pseudomonas and
flagyl for potential GI source considering proctitis seen on CT.
A PICC line was placed. The patient's mental status improved
with lactulose, rifaximin, and antibiotics and her vitals
remained stable. Several repeat blood cultures were all
nega
