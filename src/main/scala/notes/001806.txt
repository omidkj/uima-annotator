History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: 55 y/o male with COPD (not on home
oxygen) and EtOH cirrhosis who came to [**Hospital3 3583**] 2 weeks
ago with a report of increased shortness of breath. He was
diagnosed with LLL pneumonia, left pleural effusion, and small
nodule in the RLL. Pulmonary was consulted and recommended a
thoracentesis and bronchoscopy. He declined these procedures. He
was discharged on PO levofloxacin.
.
He completed 5 days of therapy, but then developed cough,
worsening sputum production, and increasing dyspnea. He had a
repeat CT scan of the chest which confirmed dramatic progression
of disease when compared to prior CT scan of [**5-29**]. There was a
large loculated pleural effusion on the left c/w possible
empyema. There is extensive atelectasis in the residual left
lung apex where there are cavitary or emphysematous changes.
Left main stem bronchus is no longer visible and occluded. There
are diffuse infiltrates throughout the R lung and small R
pleural effusion, ascites, cirrhosis, and enlarged spleen.
.
Prior to transfer, patient received vancomycin and zosyn, and
flagyl.
.
Vitals on transfer were: HR 64, BP 138/72, 92% on 50% FIO2.
.
On the floor, patient reports that he is mildly uncomfortable
with breathing. He denies fevers. Reports cough with greenish
phlegm. Denies chest pain.
.
Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI. Also reports 8 lb weight loss in 1 mo.

CXR [**2115-6-13**]
Current study demonstrates complete opacification of the left
hemithorax with minimal lucency noted at the left apex. These
findings are highly concerning for a combination of large
pleural effusion and atelectasis giving the absence of the right
mediastinal shift. Central obstruction with significant
atelectasis are suspected. On the right, there is small amount
of pleural effusion, partially imaged and potentially loculated
(note is made that the right costophrenic angle was not included
in the field of view). In addition, there is right lower lobe
opacity as well as vascular prominence and questionable right
upper lobe opacities. Although the vascular engorgement may be
physiologic, reflecting the constriction of the vascularity in
the left hemithorax, it can represent volume overload

CT CHEST W/ CONTRAST IMPRESSION:
 1. Moderate residual hydropneumothorax with split pleura sign
suggesting
empyema, which could be confirmed by examination of pleural
fluid characteristics.
 2. Left apical cavitary lesion with an intraluminal rounded
opacity suggests mycetoma or semi-invasive aspergillus.
 3. Complete collapse of the left lower lobe bronchus and
expanded left lower lobe with low attenuation suggests drowned
lung.
 4. Right lower lobe consolidative peribronchobronchovascular
mass with
vascular attenuation and associated right hilar adenopathy
concerning for
neoplasm or aggressive fungal infection. Bronchoscopy should be
considered. Otherwise, CT follow up after treatment of acute
symptoms is recommended.
 5. Multiple lytic bone lesions in the sternum, scapula and
vertebral bodies may represent multiple myeloma versus
metastatic disease.
 6. Diffuse ground-glass opacity in the bilateral upper lobes
could be related to multifocal infection or aspiration.
  7. Small nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion and pericardial
effusion.
  8. Cirrhosis and at least small to moderate ascites.


Brief Hospital Course:
53yo male with COPD and EtOH cirrhosis presenting with worsening
SOB and loculated pleural effusion concerning for empyema from
OSH.

# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: On presentation patient's
respiratory distress appeared to be related to the OSH diagnosed
pneumonia and likely parapneumonic effusion or empyema. CXR
showed nearly complete white-out of the L lung and OSH CT chest
showed large loculated pleural effusion on the left with
extensive atelectasis in the residual left lung apex, and
occluded left mainstem bronchus.
He was started on vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl as he has not
improved with levofloxacin monotherapy from OSH and considered
he may have anaerobic infection.
The patients COPD seemed to play a minimal role in his
respiratory distress. There was no evidence of chronic CO2
retention per review of ABG or chemistry. Interventional
Pulmonary performed a thoracentesis. And patient showed
symptomatic improvement. Cytology revealed very abnormal cells
concerning for malignancy but cell block was required for
definite diagnosis. He also had a CT Chest which showed RLL
consolidative mass with right hilar adenopathy concerning for
neoplasm, a consolidation of the LLL with complete collapse of
the LLL bronchus, and multiple lytic bone lesions in the
sternum, scapula and vertebral bodies which suggested a
metastatic process.
Patient was maintaining adequate oxygenation on a venti mask. On
HD2 patient became tachypnic and tachycardic and required
intubation. The family was informed of the high likelihood the
patient had metastatic lung cancer and the dismal prognosis.
They stated that his wishes would be consistent with being made
CMO. However, they wanted family members to have the opportunity
to come and visit with him. On HD4 patient was noted to have
cyanotic right foot, bleeding from IV sites and lab work
consistent with a diagnosis of DIC. On HD5 his family was able
to come see him and he was made CMO. He was pronounced dead at
5:35pm on [**2115-6-18**].
