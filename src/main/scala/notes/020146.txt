History of Present Illness:
78 yo woman with multiple medical problems including
hypertension and diabetes mellitus and multiple recent
hospitalizations who was admitted from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with altered
mental status.

Patient had been discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2117-4-6**] after an
admission for GI bleed. She was discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
While at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab her course was complicated by C. diff
infection for which she was started on metronidazole. Her WBC
continued to rise and she was started on vancomycin PO. On the
morning of admission, patient was noted by her physician to be
lethargic and she had an O2 sat of 93% on TM. Due to her altered
mental status and rising WBCs, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].

Upon arrival in the ED, temp 98.2, HR 95, BP 110/70, RR 20, and
pulse ox 96% RA. While in the ED, her vital signs were notable
for one blood pressure measured 72/47 but was 96/40 on recheck.
Exam was unremarkable. She received vancomycin, zosyn, and
metronidazole.

Of note, she has had multiple recent hospital admissions. She
was admitted in [**Month (only) 956**] was recently admitted to the intensive
care unit from 4/9-14/09 with a lower GI bleed requiring 6 units
pRBCs. No source of bleed was identified during angiography or
colonoscopy, although her hematocrit remained stable after blood
transfusions. Her warfarin was discontinued, and she was
discharged to [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.

CT abdomen and pelvis ([**4-16**])
1. Tiny bilateral effusions and left basilar atelectasis.
2. Cardiomegaly.
3. Distended gallbladder. Clinical correlation is recommended,
and an
ultrasound can be obtained for further evaluation.
4. Right adrenal nodule not meeting CT criteria for an adenoma.
MRI could be performed for further evaluation.
5. Vascular calcifications.
6. Diverticulosis without evidence of acute diverticulitis.
Evaluation for colitis is limited without the administration of
oral or IV contrast, however, mild diffuse pericolonic fat
stranding is seen, which may suggest
an underlying colonic process.
7. Diffuse anasarca.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute hemorrhage.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo woman with history of multiple medical problems including
type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea
s/p trach placement, and breast cancer was admitted with
leukocytosis most likely related to C. diff and acute renal
failure.

# C diff: She was found to be c diff positive at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.
She was afebrile overnight and her white count continued to
trend down. She was treated with IV metronidazole and po
vancomycin with plan to complete 14 day course after last dose
of antibiotics for UTI, last dose on [**2117-5-8**]. We have switched
the PPI to H2 blocker due to increased risk of C dif with PPI.

# Klebsiella UTI: Sensitive to Ceftriaxone. Plan for 7-day
course of ceftriaxone, last dose on [**2117-4-24**].

# Hypotension: Pt dropped SBP to high 70s responding to repeated
fluid bolus; baseline BPs 110-130s. Cardiac enzymes negative.
Concern for sepsis. Given borderline need for pressor, given FFP
for INR 2.4 prior to placement of RIJ and A-line on [**4-17**].
However, not started on pressors despite poor urine output not
responding to fluids with CVP >10 as MAPs stayed above 60
overnight. Subsequently remained hemodynamically stable with
improving urine output.

# Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Patient has been trach
dependent since [**2087**].
Could be secondary to mental status with neuromuscular component
from obesity, OSA, and deconditioning. Pt placed on vent during
hospitalization with attempt made to wean off; able to tolerate
trach collar for most of day but placed back on pressure support
overnight.

# AMS:  Patient??????s mental status is improved, unclear what her
true basline is.  Pt more responsive to family than physicians
and thus it is difficult to access her mental status.  Patient
opens her eyes to commands and is able to move her distal
extremities.  [**Month (only) 116**] have resulted from hypercarbia, UTI or C. diff
infection.

# Acute Renal Failure: H/o CRF [**1-25**] hypertensive nephrosclerosis
with atrophic left kidney. Likely pre-renal from C. diff colitis
as well as with klebsiella UTI. Resolving with fluids and
antibitoics.

# Hypernatremia: Resolved with free water boluses via OG tube.


# H/o Breast Cancer: Intially held arimidex given pt was on vent
and not taking POs. Can restart at rehab.

# Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Patient has a history of T2DM and
was only on insulin sliding scale. Continu
