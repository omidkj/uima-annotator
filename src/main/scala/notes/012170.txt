Chief Complaint:
Lightheadedness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a [**Age over 90 **] y/o f with htn, dm2, cad s/p cabg who presents with
lightheadedness starting this AM. She states she'd been under
severe stressors recently and had not been eating well as a
result. She awoke the morning of presentation, feeling her
normal self, went to the bank, became rather irritated while
dealing with the teller, and began to feel "spacy." It is
difficult for her to further characterize this, yet she denies
confusion or disorientation; the symptoms sound most like
lightheadedness, without chest pain, palpitations, shortness of
breath, or diaphoresis. The symptoms had resolved by the time
she reached the ED, where she was found to be afebrile,
normotensive, non-tachycardic, and satting 100% on room air. Her
ECG was unchanged.
She does have a recent h/o falls, though she denies any syncope
during these episodes, and no preceding symptoms, continually
asserting these were mechanical falls.
Within hours of reaching the floor on the first night of
admission, she became increasingly disoriented and hypotensive.
An ABG was 7.34/40/131 with a lactate of 0.9. She responded
initially to volume resucitation but despite 2L normal saline
she became hypotensive again with a SBP in the high 70s and low
80s and was thus transferred to the ICU for further monitoring.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o female with type II diabets, htn, cad s/p cabg and ptci,
and anxiety who presented with transient lightheadedness, was
transferred to the MICU for hypotension and there experienced an
[**Age over 90 7792**], and once stable was transferred to the floor with
resolving chest pain.

1.)Coronary artery disease -- Given the extent of the patient's
disease, her poor overall health, and her recent cardiac
catheterization showing a non-intervenable lesion in the LAD,
Mrs. [**Known lastname 98664**] was maximally medically managed in the MICU
early in her admission.  Once back on the floor, she again
experienced chest pain with increasing CK's, and the heparin
drip was restarted; her pain soon resolved, with declining CK's,
allowing the discontinuation of heparin.  Aspirin, isosorbide
dinitrate, and atorvastatin were continued, clopidogrel was
added to the regimen (given its known benefit in medically
managed acute coronary syndrome), and her metoprolol was
titrated up to achieve a goal resting hear rate of 55-60.  On
this regimen, she remained chest pain free without further
evidence of ischemia.  The plan was to discharge Mrs.
[**Known lastname 98664**] on this regimen and to have her follow-up with her
outpatient cardiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2031**], who also followed her while
an inpatient.

2.)Delirium -- During her ICU stay, Mrs. [**Known lastname 98664**] evinced
signs of delirium, most prominently disorientation and
fluctuating levels of conciousness.  This was attributed to
multiple medical problems, including her [**Name (NI) 7792**], pneumonia, and
the ICU environment (ICU delirium).  These problems were each
treated individually as described elsewhere with good effect.

3.)Pneumonia -- Seen initially on a routine chest x-ray, this
radiologic finding, in conjuction with her symptoms of
productive cough, prompted the team to initiate levofloxacin for
a probable pneumonia.  The patient tolerated the medication well
and remained afebrile with declining symptoms.  Early in the
treatment course she required a modicum of supplemental oxygen
support (two liters) but soon demonstrated good saturation
(96-98%) on room air.  The plan was to finish a ten day course
of levofloxacin.

4.)Hypotension -- Only noted during her admission day and not
again after her MICU transfer, this abnormality was felt to be
due to a combination of hypovolemia and the receipt of her blood
pressure medications at the same time.  There was some question
of whether she actually took both atenolol and lisinopril at
home, and if she did not, perhaps the combination of both
medications, taken at the same time, in the setting of
hypovolemia, produced this effect.  As previously described, she
remained normotensive throughout the remainder of the admission,
tolerating increasing doses of
