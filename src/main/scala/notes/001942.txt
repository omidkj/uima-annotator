Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted on [**3-28**] to the cardiology service with PMH as above.
Referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] from CT [**Doctor First Name **] for surgical evaluation
after cardiac cath revealed LM and 3VD. Pre-op evaluation
included room air ABG, PFTs, carotid US, additional labs and and
echo. CXR at OSH showed a large right pleural effusion, but here
revealed a small left effusion.  RUQ ultrasound was negative.
Echo showed EF 25-30% with 2+MR and 2+TR. Creatinine was
monitored as well as continued improvement of CHF. Left ICA was
occluded, right less than 40%. LFTs remained elevated likely due
to congestion. PFTs showed elements of COPD. Underwent  CABG x3
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**4-2**]. Transferred to the CSRU on milrinone,
epinephrine, levophed and propofol drips. These were weaned
slowly over the next few days. He was extubated the next
afternoon. Amiodarone was started for frequent ectopy given his
recent MI. Chest tubes were removed in the CSRU. Foley and
pacing wires were removed on POD #4 and he was transferred to
the floor on POD #5. Converted to SR and swan removed.
Transfused one unit PRBCs prior to transfer. Presumed gout flare
started on both knees and an ankle on POD #6. Colchicine and
steroids with taper started per rheumatology consult. ACE-I was
eventually started given his poor EF.

Heparin and coumadin started for AFib and ectopy on POD #8.
Colchicine ultimately stopped for a rise in creatinine again.
Vomited blood and clots on [**4-10**], transferred back to CSRU for
hypotension. Heparin was stopped.  Femoral venous line started
with rapid IV fluids and stablization. GI consulted, NGT placed,
and transfused 3 units PRBCs. EGD in the AM showed a probable
healing [**Doctor First Name **]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear with no active bleeding. PPI's were
continued. He re-bled the next day. INR reversed with FFP.
Transferred back to the floor on POD #13 with stable Hct of 29.
He had small melanotic stools and also had intermittent Afib.
Amiodarone was increased. Colonoscopy done on [**4-17**] which showed
some rectal ulcers and sigmoid diverticulosis. High fiber diet
recommended. He had a brief episode of sinus brady overnight and
beta-blockade decreased. Rheumatology consulted for transiton to
oral steroids for continued taper. His hematocrit remained
stable and he continued to maintain good hemodynamics. Medical
therapy was optimized and he was eventually discharged to home
on postoperative day 16.
