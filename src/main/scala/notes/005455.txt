Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with a history of CAD/CHF, diabetes, who
was found at his rehab to have respiratory distress. 911 was
called and the patient was found by EMS to be "blue" and not
responsive. He was felt to he hypervolemic and was given 80 mg
lasix by EMS. Vitals were BP 88/50 HR 105 02 56% RA
.
On arrival to the ER, he was poorly responsive and was placed on
CPAP with improvement in his 02 sats and mental status. As well,
patient was started on levaquin and flagyl.
.
Upon arrival to the ED, he felt that his breathing was
significantly improved. He denied chest pain, dizziness. Does
report recent fever, chills, and does cough up yellowish sputum
that isn't significantly chagned. He notes that he has had
increased fluid intake but has been taking his lasix at his
rehab. Per family he has had weight gain recently and has been
feeling short of breath for the last 3 days. Of note, he was
seen in [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 745**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and treated with lasix for hypervolemia
that was limited by his creatinine. He has recently been treated
for a UTI with bactrim and denies urinary or GI symptoms.

CT head [**9-15**]:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
2. Incompletely evaluated low-density lesion in the right
maxillary antrum with extension to the nasopharynx. This finding
could represent a retention cyst evolving to a mucocele or
antrochoanal polyp.
.
CXR [**9-15**]:
Bilateral pleural effusions with diffuse interstitial and
alveolar opacities bilaterally consistent with pulmonary edema.
.
ECHO [**9-15**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular  hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild
regional left ventricular  systolic dysfunction with basal and
mid inferior hypokinesis (RCA territory).  The remaining
segments contract normally (LVEF = 50%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right  ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There are three  aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is no frank aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.  The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve  prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary  artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
c/w CAD. Mild  pulmonary hypertension. Elevated intracardiac
filling pressures.
.
Renal u/s [**9-16**]:
IMPRESSION: Unchanged cortical thinning without evidence for
hydronephrosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] yo M with a history of CHF, CAD s/p 2 prior MIs
with acute on chronic renal failure with respiratory distress
triggered by congestive heart failure and possible pneumonia due
to S. aureus infection.
.
# Respiratory distress: Thought likely secondary to worsening
CHF. Admission weight was 175lbs, up from of 166lbs. However
sputum cultures were positive for S.aureus sensitive to
nafcillin and patient was started on 10 day course of
levofloxacin for PNA. Pt was discharged on day 5 of levaquin.
Patient was also provided tessalon perles and albuterol nebs for
symptomatic relief. At the time of discharge patient was no
longer short of breath and did not require 02 via nasal cannula.

.
# CHF exacerbation: On admission patient was in respiratory
distress with worsening pulmonary edema on CXR and fluid
retention with bilateral pedal edema. An ECHO was completed
which demonstrated mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with basal and mid inferior hypokinesis (RCA
territory).  The remaining segments contracted normally (LVEF =
50%) with mild systolic dysfunction. MI was considered as
inciting factor but patient's CE's were flat. Patient was
monitored on telemetry with no events. He was diuresed with
lasix, and given hydralazine for afterload reduction and
metoprolol for rate control.  We decreased his dose of lasix to
20mg PO daily at time of discharge. Diuresis was limited by
acute renal failure. His weight at discharge was 160 pounds.
.
# CAD: Patient has history of 2 prior MIs. While in house
patient was ruled out for acute MI. CK's flat. Tn-T 2 sets
mildly elevated to 0.02 and 0.03. 2nd set was completed after
patient complained of lightheadedness. Tn was 0.06 at that time
with flat CK's. ECHO revealed mild systolic dysfunction. Patient
was continued on CAD regimen of ASA, and Bblocker. His Ace-I was
held in setting of acute renal failure. As per renal team, ACE-I
can be started in the future, but after renal function stable.
Patient was started on low dose statin at time of discharge.
Baseline LFTs normal. Should be monitored as outpatient.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure. Baseline renal function (Cr
2.2). Patient has chronic kidney disease from Diabetes Mellitus
and hypertension. Acute renal failure was likely prerenal in
setting of CHF and poor forward flow. However, Feurea was
greater than 60%. Renal ultrasound was negative for post
obstructive cuase. Urine cultures were negative. UA sediment was
bland with no casts. Patient was seen by renal consult team and
given mixed picture, overall cause of acute renal failure was
attributed mostly to prerenal cause. Regardless, patient's renal
function improved with diuresis. Peak creatinine wa
