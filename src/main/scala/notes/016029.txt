CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2174-7-13**] 4:33 PM
FINDINGS: There are multifocal areas of high attenuation along
primarily
frontal sulci bilaterally, representing acute subarachnoid
hemorrhage. There is also a small component of subdural hematoma
layering along the right side of the tentorium, and perhaps, the
left (or within that ambient cistern). There is no parenchymal
contusion, significant edema or sift of mildline structures.
There is no acute major vascular territorial infarct. The
ventricles are normal in size. The basilar and perimesencephalic
cisterns are otherwise preserved. The osseous structures are
unremarkable. Moderate mucosal thickening in the left maxillary
sinus is noted.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral multifocal subarachnoid hemorrhage with a
component of subdural hematoma, layering above the tentorium. No
significant mass effect, cerebral edema or shift of midline
structures; no skull fracture.


Radiology Report CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2174-7-22**]
8:32 AM
The study is somewhat motion degraded. Small amount of
subarachnoid
hemorrhage in bifrontal lobes is again noted, which is somewhat
improved
compared to the prior study. There is a small amount of
hemorrhage along the
right tentorium reflection. No acute transcortical infarction is
seen.

Ventricles and sulci are stable.

There is a small amount of left maxillary sinus fluid. There is
subtle
hypodensity in the left temporal lobe medially, which could
represent
previously noted contusion on the MRI. The basilar cisterns are
patent.

IMPRESSION:

Stable to slightly decreased intracranial hemorrhage. No new
foci of
hemorrhage are seen.

Radiology Report CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2174-7-13**]
4:34 PM


CT C-SPINE W/O CONTRAST   Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 78518**]
FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are visualized.
There are no
acute fractures or alignment abnormalities. Atlantoaxial,
atlanto-occipital
and bilateral facet articulations are preserved.

Incidental note of unfused ossification centers at the anterior
neural arch of
C1 is made. There is severe degenerative disease involving
multiple vertebral
bodies. Marginal osteophyte formation and bilateral neural
foraminal
narrowing, most prominently involving the left C3-C4 and C4-C5
neural
foramina. Lung apices demonstrate atelectasis right more than
left, and mild
pleural thickening. Small amount of left IJ air is likely
iatrogenic.
Displaced left clavicular fracture is better seen on the
concurrent studies.

Prevertebral and paravertebral soft tissues are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute fracture or alignment abnormality of the cervical
spine.

2. Multilevel degenerative disease with severe neural foraminal
narrowing,
most prominently involving the left C3-C4 and C4-C5 levels.


Radiology Report MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2174-7-15**]
8:55 PM
FINDINGS: As seen on the CT, there is evidence of extensive
subarachnoid
hemorrhage in both frontal lobes, along the sulci in the left
parietal and
occipital lobe as well as blood is seen along the quadrigeminal
cistern. There
is subdural hematoma along the tentorium and also small subdural
hematoma in
the right frontal region and along the falx.

On diffusion images, subtle areas of high signal identified
along the left
periventricular region, along the left external capsule and also
in the left
upper midbrain and left posterior temporal region. No abnormal
signal is seen
within the corpus callosum. Subtle abnormalities are also seen
in the
subcortical region of the left frontal lobe, but evaluation is
limited
secondary to adjacent subarachnoid hemorrhage. These findings
are
predominantly in subcortical location and could represent axonal
injury.
Additionally, there is increased signal identified in the medial
left temporal
lobe without evidence of blood products. This could be secondary
to contusion
or could be a manifestation of transient uncal herniation at the
time of
trauma. There is evidence of small amount of blood in the
ventricles. There
is no midline shift or hydrocephalus.

IMPRESSION:

1. Diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage in the frontal lobes, left
parietal and
occipital lobes and along the quadrigeminal cistern.

2. Small subdural hematomas as described above.

3. Small areas of signal abnormalities predominantly on the
diffusion images
involving the left frontal subcortical region, left
periventricular region,
left external capsule and left posterior temporal region and
left side of the
midbrain could represent axonal injury.

4. Increased signal in the left medial temporal lobe could be
secondary to
contusion.

5. Small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage.

6. No evidence of abnormal parenchymal, vascular, or meningeal
enhancement.

Radiology Report BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS Study Date of [**2174-7-15**]
7:27 AM

FINDINGS: Grayscale, color and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**] of bilateral
common femoral,
superficial femoral, popliteal and tibial veins were performed.
There is
normal flow, compression and augmentation seen in all of the
vessels.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.












Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to the Trauma Service. Neurosurgery was
consulted urgently given her head injuries. These were non
operative; she was loaded with Dilantin in the Emergency room.
Once stabilized she was transferred to the Trauma ICU where she
remained for several days. Her sedation was weaned in order to
assess her mental status. She did not awaken as was hoped and so
discussions took place with the family on placement of
tracheostomy, PEG and filter. She was taken to the operating
room on [**2174-7-18**] where she
