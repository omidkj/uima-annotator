CHEST: The right subclavian central venous catheter terminates
appropriately in the mid SVC. The left internal jugular catheter
is malpositioned terminating in the left superior intercostal
vein. ET tube is appropriately positioned and terminates in the
mid trachea. The NG tube extends below the level of the
hemidiaphragms and is post-pyloric in positioning.

The visualized thyroid gland is unremarkable. The heart is
enlarged, without pericardial effusion. Dense coronary artery
calcifications. Aortic and mitral valve calcifications are
unchanged. Borderline in size mediastinal lymph nodes are seen,
specifically in the paratracheal position measuring up to 1 cm
in short axis. Although this study is not designed to evaluate
the pulmonary arteries, no filling defect is seen to suggest
pulmonary embolus. The thoracic aorta is normally opacified with
dense arteriosclerosis. The ascending aorta is mildly ectatic
measuring up to 3.7 cm. Descending thorasic aorta is normal
caliber. Bilateral pleural effusions are layering and have
slightly increased in size. Associated bibasilar atelectasis.
Concomitant consolidation with preserved air bronchograms cannot
be excluded. Additional multifocal patchy airspace opacities are
seen throughout both lungs. This may represent volume overload
and/or an evolving infectious/inflammatory pneumonitis. There is
confluent consolidation also seen in a patchy distribution in
the posterior aspects of both upper lobes. No airway lesion
is identified.

ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: The liver appears unremarkable on this
single phase of
imaging. Reflux of intravenous contrast into the hepatic veins
suggests right
heart strain. Cholelithiasis. Vicarious accumulation of contrast
into the
gallbladder lumen. The pancreas is near completely replaced by
fat. The
spleen is unremarkable. The stomach is appropriately
decompressed by NG tube,
which terminates in the post-pyloric region. The native kidneys
are
bilaterally significantly atrophic, without hydronephrosis or
hydroureter.
Stable bilateral perinephric stranding. Adrenal glands are
unremarkable
bilaterally. Visualized non-opacified small bowel loops are
normal in caliber.
Mild thickening of portions of the colon may be a result of
underdistension
rather than thickening related to a mild colitis.

Trace free fluid is now seen within the abdomen, particularly in
the paracolic
gutters and in the presacral region. Patient is status post
bilateral lower
quadrant renal transplants. The right lower quadrant renal
transplant is
markedly atrophic. Left renal transplant appears unchanged
without
hydronephrosis. There is no significant enhancement. There is
trace fluid
surrounding the left renal transplant, similar to previous exam.
Scattered
diverticula of the colon. Remaining pelvic loops of bowel,
distal ureters,
prostate and seminal vesicles are unremarkable. The urinary
bladder is
partially decompressed but appears to have associated
inflammatory changes, a concomitant cystitis cannot be excluded.
No significant new pelvic or inguinal adenopathy.
Post-procedural stranding and fluid are seen in both inguinal
regions, likely related to recent intervention. No discrete
collection is seen. Worsening anasarca of the surrounding
subcutaneous fat.

CTA OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: The abdominal aorta is normal in
caliber with dense calcific atherosclerosis along its length.
There is extensive calcific atherosclerotic disease involving
the celiac artery and its branches, superior mesenteric artery,
inferior mesenteric artery, and bilateral native renal arteries.
The celiac axis again demonstrates moderate stenosis due to
calcific atherosclerosis. The SMA is patent without significant
stenosis. The [**Female First Name (un) 899**] origin again demonstrates patchy multifocal
areas of moderate-to-severe stenosis and appears increasingly
opacified distally beyond its origin. Both native renal arteries
have a severe degree of stenoses and calcification. There
appears to be restenting of the distal aorta extending into both
common iliac arteries. There is now opacification in the distal
aorta extending into the common iliac arteries. Preserved
opacification of both external and internal iliac arteries is
now visualized. Extensive calcified atherosclerotic disease is
present within the common, internal, and external iliac arteries
bilaterally. There is flow demonstrated in the renal artery
supplying the left iliac fossa renal transplant, a significant
improvement from prior study. Partially visualiz
