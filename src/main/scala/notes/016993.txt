rest. Secundum
ASD.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were
obtained from 2D

- normal;
basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal
anterolateral
- normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal;
septal apex -
normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex -
normal;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic
root. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in ascending aorta.
Normal
descending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in descending aorta.


AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Severely
thickened/deformed aortic
valve leaflets. Severe AS. Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular
calcification. Moderate thickening of mitral valve chordae. Mild
(1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets.
Moderate [2+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR. Physiologic (normal) PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the
procedure.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No mass/thrombus is seen in
the left atrium
or left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in
the body of the right atrium or the right atrial appendage. A
left-to-right
shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at rest. A secundum
type atrial
septal defect is present. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall
motion are normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic root.
There are
simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are simple
atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is severe
aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral
valve
chordae. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.

Sinus rhythm. Left anterior fascicular block. T wave inversions
in
leads I and aVL could be due to ischemia. Compared to the

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 95279**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2196-3-1**] for further
management of her dyspnea on exertion. She was taken to the
catheterization lab in [**2196-1-6**] where she was found to have
no significant CAD, severe mitral  regurgitation with moderate
pulmonary hypertension, LVEF 55%. Given the severity of her
disease, the cardiac surgical service was consulted for surgical
repair of her valve. She was worked-up in the usual preoperative
manner including an echocardiogram which revealed severe aortic
stenosis, 1+ mitral regurgitation with a resting left to right
shunt via a small secundum ASD. On [**2196-3-1**], Mrs. [**Known lastname 95279**] was
taken to the operating room. She underwent a aortic valve
replacement using a 21mm [**Last Name (un) **] [**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial model
2700 bioprosthesis. Postoperatively she was taken to the cardiac
surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. On postoperative
day one, she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated.
Beta blockade and aspirin were resumed. She was gently diuresed
towards his preoperative weight. On POD 2 Her pressors were
weaned, chest tubes were removed, and she was transferred to the
cardiac stepdown unit.   Beta blockade and aspirin were resumed.
She was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. On POD
3 her epicardial wires were removed without incident.  The
physical therapy service was consulted to assist with her
postoperative strength and mobility. She had episodes of
hypertension requiring hydralazine.  Her ACE-I, calcium channel
blocker, and beta blocker were titrated to good effect.  Her
oxygen saturations improved to 97% on 2liters O2.  The physical
therapy service was consulted to assist with her postoperative
strength and mobility. On POD 6 Ms. [**Known lastname 95279**] was 3kg above her
preop weight with marginal exercise tolerance, no SOB, or chest
pain.  Her blood pressure was stable.  Her sternotomy incision
was clean, dr
