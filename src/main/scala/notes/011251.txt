Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Codeine / Flagyl

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 45**]
Chief Complaint:
STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
coronary catheterization

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 89y/o F with a PMH of hypertension admitted
with inferior and inferior lateral STEMI. The patient awoke at
5AM with a mid-sternal chest pressure. She initially thought the
pain was secondary to indigestion. Over the course of the day
her pain persisted and began radiating to the back, the severity
remained unchanged. This pm she called her brother as she became
concerned that her pain was not improving. He was initially not
home so she waited another 30 minutes until he returned home and
took her to the BIDNH ED. The patient denies any prior episoded
of chest pain and shortness of breath. She reports that she just
returned from a 4 week trip in [**State 4565**] during which she was
walking over 2 miles daily with no symptoms.
.
On arrival to BIDNH the patient had continued chest pressure.
Initial vitals T 97.7, HR 97, BP 179/91, RR 17, O2 99% on RA.
ECG demonstrated inferior ST elevations and anterior ST
depressions concerning for posterior MI. She was given NTG SL,
Metoprolol 5mg IV, Eptifibatide bolus plus gtt, Heparin gtt,
Clopidogrel 600mg and ASA 325mg. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for emergent cardiac catheterization.
.
The patient was transferred directly to the cardiac cath lab.
Initial cath was attempted through R radial artery however
catheter was unable to be threaded through the subclavian so R
femoral access was obtained. She was found to have a right
dominant coronary system. The PDA had a 90% stenosis in its mid
portion. The distal continuation of the RCA was totally occluded
and there was staining of the distal posterolateral branch. She
underwent PCI with a BMS to the distal PLSA.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiac catheterization [**2190-2-13**] - Right dominant system. LMCA
normal. LAD gave rise to a large septum branch that ran within
the mycocardium to the apex. The LAD ran on the lateral anterior
wall and has a beaded 80-90% calcified stenosis. There was a
very small diagonal branch that had a 80% stenosis in its
origin. The LCx was a smaller vessel with a 60-70% stenosis in
its origin. RCA - the proximal mid and distal RCA was ectatic
with lumen irregularities. The PDA had a 90% stenosis in its mid
portion. The distal continuation of the RCA was totally occluded
and there was staining of the distal posterolateral branch.

Brief Hospital Course:
INFEROLATERAL STEMI - Patient went to cardiac catheterization
and a bare metal stent was placed in her postero-lateral
segmental artery. She remained hemodynamically stable and chest
pain free after this procedure. It is noted that patient has
evidence of multivessel disease with 80-90% stenosis of LAD,
60-70% stenosis of LCx. She was continued on Aspirin 325,
Clopidogrel 75 daily, Atorvastatin 80 mg, Metoprolol Succinate
25 mg and Lisinopril 5 mg prior to discharge. A trans-thoracic
echo was performed which showed a depressed EF of 40-45% and
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe
hypokinesis of the basal half of the inferior and inferolateral
walls. Moderate MR was also noted. Patient has follow up with
Cardiology in [**Location (un) 620**] for further management.

HYPERTENSION: started metoprolol and restarted lisinopril at
lower dose given low blood pressures.

HYPERLIPIDEMIA: LDLc not at goal of 120. Continued on
Atorvastatin 80 mg daily. LFTs with mild AST elevation (likely
in setting of STEMI), all others normal. Follow up LFTs should
be deferred in the outpatient.

OSTEOPOROSIS: continued calcium and vitamin D

ABNORMAL UA: Patient had low grade fever without focal signs of
infection. A UA was sent which showed wbcs, however multiple UAs
showed contaminated specimens. Since patient did not have
symptoms, she was not treated.

your primary care and cardiologist.

Your new medications include:
START:
Plavix 75 mg daily (You should take this medication for 12
