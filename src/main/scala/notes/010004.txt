Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7223**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization and coronary stenting

History of Present Illness:
51 y/o obese M w/ significant PMH of sleep apnea, HTN, CAD, s/p
recent inferior STEMI, catheterization w/no [**First Name3 (LF) **], discharged on
cardiac cocktail of Asprin, Plavix, B-blocker and statin 2 days
ago from [**Hospital1 18**], was admitted to [**Location (un) 620**] early this morning with
chest pain. Chest pain characterized as constant, substernal
tightness, [**4-5**] with radiation to R & L arm with associated
symptoms of diaphoresis. No SOB, palpitations or lightheadness.
Reports compliance to prescribed meds with no recreational or
OTC drug use. Vitals in [**Location (un) 620**] ER T 99.5, P 78, BP 156/69, RR
16, SaO2 92 on 3L. EKG noted for Hyperacute T waves in
anterolateral leads. Given 2 units of SL Nitro for relief and
started on Heparin, [**Location (un) **] and Lopressor and home dose of plavix
75mg. Then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization
.
In [**Hospital1 18**] cath lab, pt's LAD was noted to have diffuse disease
with mid vessel thrombosis and distal stenosis of 90%. Following
distal LAD taxus [**Hospital1 **], the proximal LAD sufferd a spiral
dissection [**1-29**] guide-wire retraction. Pt then recieved a
combination of BM & taxus stents throughout LAD with a final
count of 6, over an extended Flouro course > 100 mins. Following
procedure, patient noted to have large L-sided hematoma [**1-29**] to
catheterization (Hct dropped from 40-36).
.
During prior admission at [**Hospital1 18**] ([**Date range (1) 55766**]) Pt was found to have
Inferior STEMI, Cathed, no significant occlusion was noted,
however procedure complicated by an iatrogenic proximal RCA
dissection. Althought, ultimaltly, no significant disturbance in
RCA Flow, no stents were placed. [**Hospital 1094**] hospital course also
complicated by coffee ground emesis of unknown etiology that
resolved w/ cessation of integralin and heparin. He was eval. by
GI, who felt intervention was not indicated. Pt also suffered
multiple episodes of hypotension that responded adequately to
fluid and hypoxia that improved with an O2 facemask at 10L.
.
On review of symptoms, pt (+) for orthopnea of 3 pillows, PND
when off CPAP, sleeps on back w/ no preference of position. He
denies any prior history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He
denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. He denies exertional
buttock or calf pain. All of the other review of systems were
negative.

**unclear if pt has h/o murmur--PCP describes [**Name9 (PRE) 1105**]/VI systolic
murmur at base on some visit notes back to [**2165**], but no murmur
noted on PCP's exam [**2168-6-26**]

CT CHEST [**2168-9-12**]
1. No central pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection detected.

2. Near-complete collapse of the left lower lobe and atelectasis
at the right lung base above elevated right hemidiaphragm. There
is a probable small amount of mucus in the left mainstem
pulmonary bronchus. No definite endobronchial lesions detected.
Correlate clinically and with follow up or bronchoscopic
evaluation if clinically indicated.
3. Enlarged main pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary
artery
hypertension.
4. Cardiomegaly
5. Small pericardial effusion.
.
Trans-Thoracic Echo on [**2168-9-13**] demonstrated:
-IMPRESSION: Focused study for patent foramen ovale: No ASD/PFO
present via color Doppler, or saline administration. Moderate
pericarial effusion located posterior to the inferolateral wall.
Mild resting [**Year (4 digits) 55767**] gradient that increases with Valsalva
manuever. Mild MV leaflet thicking w/ [**Male First Name (un) **], no MR.
[**Name14 (STitle) 55768**] with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2168-9-7**],
[**Year (4 digits) 55767**] gradient is lower and pericardial effusion is new.
.
TTE [**2168-9-7**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is basal to mid inferior hypokinesis (the remaining segmetns are
hyperdynamic). The overall left ventricular systolic function is
preserved (LVEF>55%). There is a severe resting left ventricular
outflow tract obstruction. No mid-cavitary gradient is
identified. There is no ventricular septal defect. The remaining
left ventricular segments contract normally. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve
leaflets. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
.
IMPRESSION: Small pericardial effusion without tamponade. LVH
with valvular [**Male First Name (un) **] and severe, rtesting [**Male First Name (un) 55767**] obstruction c/w
hypertrophic/obstructive cardiomyopathy. Moderate to severe
mitral regurgitaiton.

CARDIAC CATH ([**2168-9-6**]) for Inferior STEMI
- 1. Coronary artery disease involving non-dominant RCA, likely
proximal LPDA stenosis, and possible OM and mid LAD mild
stenoses.
- 2. Iatrogenic dissection of the non-dominant RCA without
compromise of the lumen or flow with possible distal
emobolization or additional
dissection in AM1.
