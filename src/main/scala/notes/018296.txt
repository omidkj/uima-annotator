Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1148**]
Chief Complaint:
Fever, hypotension, diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] M with recent necrotizing cholecystitis s/p brief
percutaneous cholecystotomy drainage, recent MI with CHF, was at
[**Hospital 100**] Rehab with fever 101.5, hypotension to SBP 70s, 7
episodes of diarrhea yesterday. Per his daughter, he has been
more combative with altered mental status at Heb Reb over the
past few days. He had been recuperating at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab using a
walker, was alert, with generalized weakness, but last night
after 7 diarrhea episodes, got out of bed at 7 pm, and at 8 pm,
vitals were 70/40, T100.2. The patient denies pain but states
that he is dizzy. No CP, no SOB, no HA, no neck stiffness, no
N/V, +RUQ abd pain.
.
On [**2110-1-23**], he was discharged from MICU West with necrotizing
cholecystitis in the setting of an MI and CHF, so CCY was not
performed and perc drain was placed instead on [**1-18**]. Patient
pulled out the drain on [**1-22**], and surgery and IR felt that the
tube should not be replaced. Bile culture grew out GNR and Vanc
sensitive Enterococcus. He had been brought to [**Hospital 882**]
Hospital, but was transferred here since his PCP has admitting
privileges here.
.
At [**Hospital1 882**], he was given zosyn and flagyl. In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he
was given 250 ml NS x2 with SBP improving from 70s to 100s. He
was also given Ceftazidime for [**4-6**] BCx from [**Hospital1 882**] that grew
out GNR [**2-26**]. US abdomen showed cholelithiasis but no
cholecystitis, and a new left liver lobe 4 cm mass (radiology
read was changed: the word "cystic" was deleted) with internal
flow that does not look like an abscess. C. diff was considered
the most likely cause. Surgery consult felt no acute need for
intervention at this time.

Pertinent Results:
[**2110-2-26**] RUQ U/S:
1. Distended gallbladder filled with stones and sludge. No
gallbladder wall edema or pericholecysttic fluid to suggest
acute cholecystitis.
.
2. New left liver lobe mass measuring up to 4 cm. MRI or
multiphasic CT is recommended for further evaluation.
.
TTE [**2110-1-18**]
EF 25%
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and
cavity size are normal. There is moderate to severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior,
antero-septal and apical hypokinesis to akinesis. The basal
inferior wall appears hypokinetic. No masses or thrombi are seen
in the left ventricle. Right ventricular systolic function is
low normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (area 0.8-1.19cm2) The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation.
There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w CAD. Moderate
calcific aortic stenosis. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
Moderate MR.
.
[**1-16**] CT Abd/Pelvis:
1. Large heterogeneous retroperitoneal mass is most likely a
retroperitoneal sarcoma.
2. Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation and idstended
gallbladder with wall edema, sludge and stones,
ndpericholecystic fluid/stradning [**Month (only) 116**] be from external
compression by the mass, although given presence of gallstones,
choledocholisthiasis cannot be excluded. Ultrasound is ulikely
to give significant additional details, consider HIDA scan to
assess for cystic duct patency.
3. Pneumobilia. Please correlate with recent instrumentation or
prior sphincterotomy.
4. 3.6-cm exophytic hypodensity arising off the mid left kidney.

Nonemergent further evaluation with ultrasound can be performed
for additional characterization.
5. Small amount of ascites and free fluid in the pelvis.
6. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
7. Mild-to-moderate congestive heart failure with bilateral
pleural effusions.
.
[**1-17**] GB US: Technically successful placement of 10-French
pigtail catheter within a distended gallbladder. However, it
appears that the gallbladder is filled with stones and gel-like
clot. As such, there is very little drainage emanating from the
pigtail catheter. Specimen was sent for culture and Gram stain.
.
[**1-20**] CXR: Widespread pulmonary opacification which progressed
between [**1-16**] and 17 is stable, accompanied by slightly
larger small right pleural effusion. Heart size is normal. The
progression of findings suggests that the lung abnormalities are

due to edema, though not necessarily cardiogenic. There is no
pneumothorax. In the upper abdomen one can see a dilated colon
and a percutaneous biliary drainage catheter.
.
MRI abdomen:
FINDINGS: There are small bibasilar effusions and atelectasis.
There are multiple heterogeneous, but predominantly T2-
hyperintense, masses and nodules in the liver. These include a
large mass noted recently on ultrasound examination within the
left lobe, which measures 3.4 x 4.7 x 4.3 cm (AP x transverse x
vertical). There is a similar, but somewhat smaller, 3-cm
diameter mass within segment VI, as well as multiple additional
lesions up to 1.6 cm in diameter. All of these liver lesions are
new since a CT performed on [**2110-1-16**].
A large intraluminal heterogeneous mass of 4.8 cm in diameter
occupies the fundus of the gallbladder. There is mass effect on
adjacent dependent stones and sludge which are pushed medially.
One of the gallstones measures 12 mm in diameter, but numerous
others are present which are all less than 5 mm in diameter. A
small amount of residual fluid is present within the gallbladder
fossa. Several sub-5 mm stones are visualized within the common
hepatic and cystic ducts, but there is no intra- or extra-
hepatic biliary ductal dilatation.
A large portacaval mass is similar, to perhaps minimally
increased in size, compared to the earlier CT appearance from
[**2110-1-16**]. The mass measures 4.8 x 6.5 x 4.4 cm (AP x
transverse x vertical). Its contour and location are most
suggestive of a metastatic lymph node, centered at the expected
site of a portcaval node. The pancreas, and the main portal and
splenic veins, are splayed anteriorly by the mass, but
