Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5062**]
Chief Complaint:
Admitted [**6-12**] to ENT for embolization of R occipital artery
prior to biopsy of rapidly growing R paraspinal neck mass


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
- Chemoembolization of R occipital artery, biopsy R neck mass
- Bronchoscopy x 2
- Trach [**6-27**], PEG

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 28181**] experienced R neck pain for several months prior to
admission, as well as a rapidly growing mass for 1 month. He
lost 10 pounds in the previous few months, and his appetite
decreased, but no fever or night sweats.
.
Prior to admission, CT scan of the neck revealed a hypervascular
paraspinal mass (originally 4.8x4.5, 2 wks ago now 7.4x6.3cm).
He was admitted on [**7-13**] for pre-biopsy embolization of the R
occipital artery. Pathology of the neck mass (prelim) with
poorly differentiated carcinoma presumed to be [**2-28**] head/neck
malginancy.
.
During embolization, became delirious during and after the
procedure. He recieved propofol, ketamine, sux, phenyl, anzemet
and midazolam preioperatively. Also noted to have mild
post-procedure hypoxia but was stable on 3L NC until night of
[**6-16**] when hypoxia abruptly worsened accompanied by [**Last Name (un) **]-[**Doctor Last Name 6056**]
respiration and tachypnea requiring 6L then NRB, admitted to
MICU for intubation.
.
His MICU course was significant for several issues:
.
1. Resp failure: In the MICU he was intubated with difficulty. A
7 french ET tube had to be performed by anesthesia attending. He
was hypotensive on propofol and required 100% FiO2 for
7.39/32/64. Paradoxical motion of chest was noted and due to a
CXR with elevated R hemdiaphragm, concerning for RL collapse,
bronchoscopy was performed and significant secretions removed.
Repeat CXR did not reveal much improvement. A CTA was done and
ruled out PE. There was difficulty weaning pt, [**2-28**] RML
pneumonia/collapse complicated by ? diaphragmatic weakness 2/2
phrenic nerve involvement and altered mental status. On [**6-27**], pt
was trached [**2-28**] concern for airway compromise given neck mass.
He was weaned to trach mask on [**7-4**].
.
2. Fever: Due to pneumonia. Pt was initially on levo/flagyl for
possible aspiration. This was then changed to zosyn/vanco for
broader coverage. On vanc/zosyn, pt's WBC fell rapidly and pt
became neutropenic. He continued to have fevers while he was
neutropenic so he was changed to caspo, cefepime, flagyl and
vanco. His counts dropped on vanco so the vanco was d/c'd and
his wbc returned to [**Location 213**]. He was then changed to linezolid for
gram pos coverage and he became pancytopenic. Linezolid was then
stopped and daptomycin started and his counts recovered. Caspo
was stopped on [**7-7**] because he was no longer neutropenic and
there was a concern for drug fever. He completed a 14-day course
of cefepime/flagyl on [**7-9**]. On [**7-12**], pt's wbc again dropped
(consistent with chemo) and he had a fever to 102.2 so cefepime
and flagyl were restarted.
.
3. Hypotension: Pt became hypotensive during intubation, likely
due to propofol. He did not require pressors and his BP has been
maintained only with fluid boluses.
.
4. AMS: Noted to develop after biopsy (with sedation) of neck
mass. LP was done and cytology negative for malignant cells. MRI
and CT were also negative. Sedating meds were stopped and his
mental status cleared.
.
5. Neck Mass: On bx, undifferentiated high grade malignany
neoplasm with unknown primary source. MRI of brain and CT torso
without evidence of mets. ENT and radiation oncology following
the patient. Pt is now s/p carboplatinum/taxol on [**6-29**]. On [**7-2**],
pt underwent bronchoscopy with subcarinal bx showing atypical
epithelial cells with prominent nucleoli which was not helpful
for diagnosis. On [**6-30**], pt started on neupogen and continued on
this until [**7-9**] when stopped for increasing counts. His counts
starting to nadir as of [**7-12**] and neupogen was again started.
.
6. Transaminitis: Pt with elevated AST/ALT, total bili and alk
phos on admission. Hepatitis serolgies were negative, dopplers
showed nl hepatic flow and no masses on RUQ U/S. All LFTs
trended down over the ICU stay.
.
7. Tachycardia: Pt had a CTA in the setting of acute hypoxia and
tachycarida, neg for PE. Multiple EKGs done consistent with
sinus tach. Basline rates in 110s-120s.
.
Transferred to the floor on [**7-14**].

Brief Hospital Course:
55 y/o previously healthy M presenting with neck mass c/w
undifferentiated carcinoma of unknown primary s/p embolization.
Post-op course c/b change in MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 61224**] respiratory failure
requiring intubation. Trach placed for airway protection and pt
transfered to medicine floor.
.
Current Onc Therapy
- palliative XRT and low dose [**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol
- s/p XRT #5, chemo day #6 cycle 1
- tolerating XRT/chemo well
.
1. Respiratory failure: Pt was trached on [**6-27**] secondary to
concern for airway compromise given neck mass. He initially
required ventilator support however was weaned to trach mask on
[**7-4**]. Had an episode of desaturation to 81% on [**7-14**] w/ unchanged
CXR and improved with suctioning to 93%.  Repeat CXR on [**7-20**]
demonstrated improvement in prior lung opacities. He
consistently had saturations in the 90%'s since his transfer to
the floor.  Lung sounds remained clear, and aggressive
suctioning was ensured. Patient was placed on aspiration
precautions. He was initially started on levoflox/flagyl for
possible aspiration pneumonia/tracheobronchitis. These were
changed to Cefepime when first neutropenic after chemo, however
changed to Caspo, Cefepine, Daptomycin, and Flagyl given
neutropenia and persistent fevers. Patient remianed afebrile for
the balance of his stay. He was evaluated for passey-muir valve,
but due to excessive secretions, we were unable to implement it
effectively.
.
2. Change in mental status: Etiology unclear, but could be
related to his initial respiartory failure, his complications
from embolization, or tumor related. There was concern for CNS
disease given that mass was extending into cervical foramina and
dura, however initial CSF evaluation was negative. Repeat Head
CT revealed increasing mass however no evidence of CNS disease,
with a question of impingment on neural foramina and vertebral
arteries.  All sedating meds were d/c'd. He continued to become
increasingly agitated at night, when he would pull at trach and
EKG leads.  Haldol and ativan were given as needed, and
olanzepine was started. Two point restraints were tried, mittens
were used, and finally over course of stay all restraints were
eventually removed.

3. Pain Control - Pain difficult to access because of
communication difficulties. When asked if he has pain he often
shakes his head no.  PRN Morphine given for occasional complains
of rig
