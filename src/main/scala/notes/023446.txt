History of Present Illness:

78 yo M with a history of CAD s/p three-vessel CABG in [**2099**]
(LIMA-D1, SVG-D3 and SVG-OM2), HTN, and hypercholesterolemia who
was transferred from an OSH tonight for planned cardiac cath in
the am for a NSTEMI. He was at a casino on [**12-22**] with his 2 sons
when he was noted to have chest pain while climbing stairs. He
took 2 SL nitros that did not resolve the pain. He took a 3rd SL
NTG when EMS arrived resolved CP. At [**Hospital6 33**] he was
found to have ST-depressions in V1-V4 and borderline/minimal
elevations in III/aVF. He was started on heparin and integrillin
drips and plavix as well. Labs at the OSH were significant for a
CK 1350, CK-MB 106.2, and troponin-I 2.66. He was transferred to
[**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3 for cardiac catheterization in the morning.

CXR AP ([**12-24**]):
moderate cardiomegaly.  Haziness of the perihilar region and
engorged
vasculature is consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.  There
is no
pneumothorax.  There is a small left pleural effusion.  Patient
is post median sternotomy and CABG.

Echo ([**2108-12-25**]):
mildly dilated left atrium
normal left ventricular cavity size
Overall left ventricular systolic function mildly depressed with
probably basal inferoseptal, basal inferior/inferolateral
hypokinesis
LVEF= ?45 %
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion normal
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
.
CXR AP ([**11-28**]):
There has been interval placement of a dual-lead pacemaker
device with the
distal leads overlying the right atrium and right ventricle.
The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG. The heart
size is borderline.  The aorta is uncoiled and atherosclerotic.
Trachea is midline.  There is mild blunting of the costophrenic
angles bilaterally which may represent tiny effusions or pleural
thickening.  There is no pneumothorax or focal
consolidation.  There is minimal prominence of the pulmonary
vasculature,
greatly improved from [**2108-12-24**].
IMPRESSION:  Pacemaker placement as above.  No pneumothorax.
Mild residual prominence of the pulmonary vasculature.

Brief Hospital Course:
On admission to [**Hospital1 18**] pt was admitted to the [**Hospital1 1516**] service on
[**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 3.  On presentation, he was CP free and did not complain of
shortness of breath. A prior EKG was significant for the
presence of 1st degree conduction delay with RBBB.
At 12 am, the patient was noted to have a HR in the 30s on
telemetry and was found to be in CHB. SBPs were in the 90s and
the pt was assymptomatic. His HR increased back up to the 50s
without intervention. Half an hour later, the HR dipped back
down to the 40s with a BP 70/30. He received IVFs wide open and
was given atropine 1 mg X 2. His SBPs then improved to the 90s
with a HR in the 40-50s. He remained assymptomatic without chest
pain, shortness of breath, and lightheadedness. At the time of
presentation to the CCU, the patient had received a total of 2 L
IVFs.
.
CCU team course:
The following problems were [**Name2 (NI) 13744**]:
# CAD s/p NSTEMI
The enxymes peaked at CK 1350, Trop 3.72. which he had on
admission. Has remained CP free since presentation to OSH.
integrillin/heparin gtts were continued until cath the morning
after admission to the [**Hospital1 18**]. In the cath lab he was found to
have severe 3VD with patent LIMA to D1 filling LAD, Cx and RCA
but Cx compromised by intervening disease not readily amenable
to PCI and patent SVG to D3. Therefore the plan was to optimize
medical management with asa, plavix, and ezetimibe (statin
allergy).  Low dose BB (motoprolol 12.5mg) was added when EP
agreed to start from rhythm standpoint (see below).  Pt was
monitored on telemetry throughout stay without any signs of
recurrent ischemia.
.
# Rhythm
Pt had pre-existing RBBB from EKGs in [**2102**] but as mentioned
above was  found to be in complete heart block with alternating
junctional and idioventricular escape rhythm. HR and BPs did not
respond considerably to atropine X 2 but SBPs improved with
total of 2L IVFs. On presentation to the CCU, the pt was
assymptomatic with HR in the mid 40-50s, SBPs in the 90-100s,
and MAPs in the upper 50's. Likely that CHB was related to
recent ischemic event. Therefore EP wanted to manage
conservatively since they felt if ischemia resolved after
cardiac event. Given relative hemodynamic stability of patient
and relatively stable escape rhythm, did not place temporary
transvenous pacing wire which was discussed with EP fellow and
interventional cardiologist on call. Atropine and dopamine was
kept at the bedside and with trancutaneous pacer pads but never
had to be used. Pt was monitored on telemetry and spent less and
less time in CHB.  Therefore a low dose BB was added but then
ended up spending more time in CHB. EP at this time (day4)
decided to start place a permanent pacemaker which was done on
[**2108-12-28**].  The evening following the procedure the pt had a few
more events of CHF without appropriate pacing of the pacer;
therefore appropriate adjustments were made by EP the following
day (day prior to d/c)
.
# [**Name (NI) **]
Pt appeared in acute systolic heart failure initially when
arriving to the CCU.  He was diuresed gently over the next few
days with good effect and when euvolemic did not require any
additional doses of lasix po. Pt had an echo which demonstrated
overall left ventricular systolic function mildly depressed with
probably basal inferoseptal, basal inferior/inferolateral
hypokinesis and a LVEF of appr 45 %.
Supplemental O2 was weaned throughout the hospital stay and when
discharged pt was off supplemental O2.

# ID
Pt did have some very low grade temps (99-100) with a slightly
elevated WBC. UA, UC, sputum cx, blood cx, were all negative
however.  The plan was to reculture if he re-spiked [**Doctor First Name **] he
