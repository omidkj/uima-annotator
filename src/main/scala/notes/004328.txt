Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4854**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness, [**First Name3 (LF) 7186**] of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
61 y/o male with history of Wegener's granulomatosis and
autoimmune lymphopenia, on immunosuppression complicated by
multiple infections as detailed in HPI below presents with
weakness and [**First Name3 (LF) 7186**] of breath. He has been maintained on long
term azathioprine with a recent taper of his immunosuppresion
over the past several months. He has complained of dizziness and
headaches but this has thought to be related to his
antihypertension medications.  Most recently he has not had any
evidence of active pulmonary vasculitis and stable emphysema.

Today he developed lethargy and was brought to the ED by his
nephew.  [**Name (NI) **] was noted to be hypotensive with SBP 78 and
tachycardic and was started on an NRB.  A CXR demonstrated a LLL
PNA.  A central line was placed and he was started on
levofloxacin and Zosyn.  A CT chest/abdomen without contrast was
performed that demonstrated multiple anomalies including: 1.
Multiple new small nodules, many of which are cavitating, within
the right lung, which may be consistent with patient's known
Wegener's granulomatosis.  However, infectious process,
including fungal or septic emboli, cannot be excluded. 2.
Extensive consolidation in the left lower lobe, consistent with
pneumonia. 3. Limited examination for mesenteric ischemia;
however, there is loss of normal haustra and mild bowel wall
thickening of the colonic wall starting from the hepatic flexure
extending to the proximal descending colon. This could represent
an infectious/inflammatory colitis. Ischemia is thought to be
less likely due to the distribution of the abnormality, spanning
different vascular territories.
.
He was paralyzed, intubated, and sent to the ICU for further
care.

IMAGES/STUDIES:

[**2201-3-14**] ECG: Atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response.
ST-T wave abnormalities are non-specific. Since the previous
tracing of [**2200-11-26**] ventricular rate is faster and further ST-T
wave changes are present.

[**2201-3-14**] CXR: UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST: Dense consolidation
within the left lung base is concerning for pneumonia. There is
likely a small left effusion. Right internal jugular central
venous catheter tip terminates within the SVC. Focal ill-defined
patchy and nodular opacities within the right upper lobe appear
similar to the prior study. Relative lucency of the lung apices
reflects underlying emphysema. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
contours are unremarkable. There is no pneumothorax. IMPRESSION:
New consolidation in left lung base concerning for pneumonia.
Followup radiographs after treatment are recommended to ensure
resolution.

[**2201-3-14**] CT torso: IMPRESSION: 1. Multiple new small nodules,
many of which are cavitating, within the right lung, which may
be consistent with patient's known Wegener's granulomatosis.
However, infectious process, including fungal or septic emboli,
cannot be excluded. 2. Extensive consolidation in the left lower
lobe, consistent with pneumonia. 3. Limited examination for
mesenteric ischemia; however, there is loss of normal haustra
and mild bowel wall thickening of the colonic wall starting from
the hepatic flexure extending to the proximal descending colon.
This could represent an infectious/inflammatory colitis.
Ischemia is thought to be less likely due to the distribution of
the abnormality, spanning different vascular territories.  4.
Avascular necrosis of the right femoral head. 5. New
