[**2153-4-18**]:  EKG:

Sinus rhythm. Short P-R interval. No previous tracing available
for comparison

[**2153-4-18**]:  chest x-ray:

IMPRESSION:
1. Subdiaphragmatic gas implying gut perforation, per Abdomen CT
reported
separately
2. Possible small right upper lobe pneumonia. Follow up is
essential to
exclude a lung nodule.
3. Pronounced osseous demineralization and multilevel thoracic
compression
fracture deformities, unusual for age, could be traumatic given
the present of many healed right rib fractures.
4. Angulated kyphosis centered at T7 compression deformity.

[**2153-4-18**]: cat scan of the abdomen:

IMPRESSION:
1. Large amount of right-sided retroperitoneal air, in
distribution
suggestive of a posterior perforated duodenal ulcer.
2. No extraluminal contrast to indicate active leak.
3. Bubbly appearance of cecum and ascending colon without
significant
symptomology or portal venous gas, favoring benign pneumatosis
cystoides coli, less likely ischemic pneumatosis.
4. Dilatation of transverse colon with tapering at the splenic
flexure.
5. Chronic pancreatitis with pseudocyst at the pancreatic tail.
6. Compression deformities along superior endplates of T12-L3
vertebral
bodies.
7. Nonspecific thickening of sigmoid colon.

[**2153-4-18**]:  chest x-ray:


FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has received a right internal jugular vein catheter. Tip of the
catheter projects over the mid SVC. No pneumothorax or other
complications. The patient has also
received a nasogastric tube that is showing a correct course.
The appearance of the lung parenchyma and the heart is
unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was taken emergently to the operating room for an
exploratory laparotomy and right hemicolectomy (see operative
report for full details).  She was taken to the ICU intubated
afterwards but extubated shortly thereafter.  She remained
hemodynamically stable without a pressor requirement.  She was
treated with perioperative antibiotics (cipro and flagyl) for
one day.  Her pain was controlled with a morphine pca.  On POD1
she was stable for transfer to the floor.

Transferred to the surgical floor on POD #1.  She was reported
to have a decreased urine output for which she was given
additional intravenous fluids. Her urine output improved and the
foley catheter was discontinued on POD #2.  The nebulizers were
continued for her chronic obstructive lung disease and she
maintained her baseline oxygen saturation.  The steroids which
she was taking prior to her hospitalization were converted from
intravenous to an oral [**Doctor Last Name 360**].  She will be discharged on daily
predinisone with instructions to follow-up with her primary care
provider.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Last Name (un) 89419**] tube was discontinued on POD #3 and
she began sips with progression to a regular diet. Her
incisional pain was controlled with morphine PCA and she  was
transitioned to oral immediate release morphine.

Her vital signs are stable and she is afebrile.  She is eating
and has BM's. She is ambulating without assistance.  Her white
blood cell count is normal. She is preparing for discharge home
with VNA assistance.  She has instructions to follow-up with her
primary care provider regarding her prednisone dosing and for
further evaluation of a lung nodule.  She will return to the
acute care clinic in 1 week to have her wound sutures removed.
