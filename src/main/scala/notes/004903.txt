Admission Date:  [**2137-2-18**]       Discharge Date:  [**2137-2-22**]


Service:  NEUROLOGIC MEDICINE

ADDENDUM:  The following history and physical is as noted on
arrival by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old woman
with atrial fibrillation on Warfarin who was found down at
her home on the day of presentation.  On arrival, she was
unresponsive and no family was available at the bedside and,
therefore, the history is limited but we know that she has
left eye deviation and a left-sided weakness initially.  Per
the EMS and ED records, she is thought to have been sitting
in a chair at home and was noted to be less responsive at
about 8:30 p.m. on the night of arrival.  About an hour
later, EMS was called and they found her to be minimally
responsive with withdrawal on the right side to pain and no
response on the left.  Her eyes were deviated to the left.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Atrial fibrillation.
2.  Ischemic stroke 20 years ago with transient left-sided
weakness.
3.  Cataract surgery.
4.  Hypertension.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:
1.  Warfarin.
2.  Losartan.
3.  HCTZ.
4.  Potassium chloride.
5.  Magnesium supplements.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband.  She does not
drink or smoke.  She lives in [**Location 620**] with her husband,
[**Name (NI) **].  Their number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 15904**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Blood
pressure 220/100, pulse 80, respirations 18, 75-90% 02
saturation on arrival.  General:  The initial examination was
made after sedation with Fentanyl, Ativan, and paralytics;
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] saw her briefly prior to intubation.  She was
unresponsive to verbal stimuli and would not follow commands.
Corneals were present bilaterally.  She would withdrawal to
pain in all four extremities and was moving all extremities
spontaneously.  Her eyes were deviated to the left.  The toes
were upgoing on the left and equivocal on the right.  The
deep tendon reflexes were diminished but symmetric.
Subsequently, she was intubated by the ED staff for airway
protection.

Further examination revealed an intubated elderly woman with
a supple neck.  Lungs:  Clear.  Heart:  Regular.  Neurologic:
Her pupils were pinpoint and nonreactive.  She had no dolls.
The face seemed symmetric bilaterally.  Bulk was normal but
tone was decreased throughout.  However, she was paralyzed.
Muscle strength could not be tested.  Reflexes were
diminished throughout.  Toes were upgoing on the left and
equivocal on the right.  Gait and coordination could not be
assessed.

STUDIES:  INR 2.3, PT 18.6, PTT 30.2.  White count 13.2,
hematocrit 38.1, platelets 224,000.  The U/A showed small
blood and protein of 100.  ABGs 7.58, 22, 417, and 21.
Sodium 128, K 4.4, chloride 98, bicarbonate 23, BUN 33,
creatinine 1.7, glucose 144, CK 158.

Head CT did not reveal an acute bleed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 15905**] was admitted to the Neuro
Intensive Care Unit for further management.  Her clinical
presentation is most consistent with a significant cerebral
infarction.  Her further workup revealed a significant
myocardial infarction with a troponin greater than 50 and CK
MB greater than 20.  Her neurologic status continued to be
poor.  Her imaging studies done revealed multivessel ischemic
infarction including MCA and PCA territories bilaterally in
the setting of an acute MI in a patient with atrial
fibrillation.

Her clinical prognosis is extremely poor and neurologically
she appears to be devastated after multivessel infarction,
although we continued to control her blood pressure and
provide Warfarin.

Given the overall clinical picture, a family discussion
resulted in a decision to focus on Mrs.[**Known lastname 15906**] comfort.
Her medications were discontinued and she was given
analgesics as needed for her comfort.  Subsequently, she died
on [**2137-2-22**] in no pain.
