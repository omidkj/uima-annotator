Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxic arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right femoral TLC placement
Left IJ TLC placement
Right radial arterial line placement

History of Present Illness:
75yp F with multiple medical problems including CAD, CHF, a-fib,
DM, & CRI who presents with increasing BLE edema extending to
upper thighs, 25 lb wt gain over last 3 weeks despite diuretics
(lasix & zaroxolyn). Pt also with increasing erythema/redness to
BLE, greatest R foot where there is also a healing wound -
reports cat landing on foot ~ 2 weeks ago with break in skin. No
drainage. No fevers, but subjective chills (? cold intolerance).
Pt is primarily non-ambulatory, gets around in motorized chair
but increasing difficulty with minimal standing due to pain from
swelling.

Patient admitted to floor, started on vanc and lasix/zaroxlyn.
At 9pm, code blue called. Patient found hypoxic, NSR in 70's
with weak pulse, intubated, PEA, recieved epi x2, chest
compressions, vfib, recieved shock 200J, regained pulse, Afib
w/RVR, BP 98/50. Transferred to the MICU.

Social History:
Pt. is widowed having just lost her husband in the last 6 months

Family History:
Non-contributory.

Physical Exam:
on transfer to the MICU

GEN: obese female, intubated
HEENT: NCAT, pupils unequal R>L and minimally reactive, no gag,
ETT and OG tubes in place
PULM: course rhonchi bilaterally with decreased BS at bases
CV: RRR, no murmurs
ABD: grossly obese, hypoactive bowel sounds, mildly distended
GU: foley in place
EXT: [**2-14**]+ pitting edema from feet to groin with erythema, warmth
of RLE
NEURO: intubated, not responding to pain


Pertinent Results:
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST  [**2141-12-15**] 11:15 PM
Examination is limited due to difficulties with patient
positioning. Allowing for this, there is no acute intracranial
hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of normally midline
structures. Ventricles and sulci are prominent but symmetric,
compatible with involutional change. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]- white matter
differentiation is grossly preserved. Focal hypodensity in the
periventricular white matter adjacent to the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**]
likely represents a chronic area of ischemia. Osseous structures
are unremarkable. There is mucosal thickening of the ethmoid air
cells.

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST; CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. Small bilateral pleural effusions and moderate amount of
ascites.
2. No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.
3. Gallstones.

EEG Study Date of [**2141-12-17**]
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG due to the presence of a
slow
background suggesting a moderate encephalopathy of toxic,
metabolic, or
anoxic etiology. No evidence for ongoing seizures was seen.

ECHO Study Date of [**2141-12-17**]
Conclusions:
1. The left atrium appears elongated and slightly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity
size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly
depressed. Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include
apical and
septal akinesis.
3. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular
systolic
function appears depressed. Unforutnately, views are limited.
4.The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is
seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is an echolucent region around th heart which appears to
be
pericardial fat but cannot rule out pericardial clot. No right
sided
ventricular collapse to suggest tamponade. No doppler studies
across the
mitral and tricuspid valve to evaluate for tamponade.



Brief Hospital Course:
[**2141-12-15**] to [**2141-12-20**]

The patient was discovered on the hospital floor in her room
during a routine vital check hypoxic, unresponsive, and apneic
at 9PM on [**12-15**]. Code blue was called, the patient was
resuscitated as described in the HPI and transferred to the ICU.
Etiology of the arrest was thought to be related to likely
aspiration in the setting of CHF. A Head CT was performed that
evening post-arrest with suspicion of bleed [**2-13**] unequal pupils
and poor neuro status. CT was negative for acute bleed. Patient
was seen by neuro on [**2141-12-16**] who found her to have intact
brainstem reflexes but was in a comatose state with a poor
prognosis. EEG was performed and did not show any seizure
activity. A MRI was not done given the patient has pacemaker.
The patient remained intubated until [**2141-12-17**] when she was
extubated. Post extubation she remained in a dissociative state,
awake but unaware of her surroundings, did not follow commands,
non-verbal. She also had intermitent fevers, remained treated
with ABx. A family meeting was held on [**12-20**] and the patient was
made CMO DNR/DNI with all family members in agreement. The
patient expired shortly after being made CMO.
