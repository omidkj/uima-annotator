Chief Complaint:
dyspnea x 12 hours


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis


History of Present Illness:
72-yo-woman w/ DM2, ESRD on HD presents w/ dyspnea x 12 hours.
She has been feeling unwell w/ increasing fatigue for 2 days.
Last night around 7pm, she developed L sided neck pain described
as "sharp, shooting," [**6-19**] severity, non-radiating, no assoc
symptoms, unrelieved by tylenol. Over the next few hours, the
pain became more severe, [**11-19**] severity radiating down the L
neck to the L shoulder. It became associated w/ nausea,
vomiting, diaphoresis, and dyspnea. This became progressively
worse until 4am, when the pt was so dyspnic that she could not
speak, prompting call to EMS for transport to ED. She denies any
recent fever, weight loss, palpitations, dietary indiscretion,
abd pain, melena, and hematochezia. She has had cough, runny
nose, and nasal congestion for a few days. There is no history
of CAD or smoking. Of note, the pt did not take her medications
yesterday as she was feeling unwell.
In the ED, the pt was severely dyspnic w/ BP 224/99, HR 120, O2
sat 100% on NRB. She was placed on CPAP 10, ABG was
7.32/46/233/25. She was given NTG SL x 1 and then started on
nitro gtt, w/ SBP decreasing to 177/82 and HR decreasing to 96.
She was also treated w/ ASA 325mg, morphine 4mg IV x 2, anzemet
12.5mg IV, lasix 100mg IV, and levoflox 500mg IV.
Currently, her dyspnea has resolved, but CP is persistent at
[**6-19**] severity in the L shoulder.

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, this is a 72 yo woman with DMW, ESRD on HD who p/w a
h/o L sided neck pain radiating down L shoulder, associated
n/v/diaphoresis/ dyspnea for 12 hrs PTA.  The pt was found to
have sinus tachy and hypertensive urgency on admission with BP
224/99--likely due to BP medication noncompliance. CXR revealed
moderate CHF and Echo revealed mild LVH, EF>55%, and moderate
pulmonary artery HTN.  The pts presentation was most c/w LV
overload/pulmonary edema secondary to hypertensive urgency. In
[**Name (NI) **] pt was started on nitro gtt and given Lasix 100 mg IV. She
was admitted initialy to the MICU and then transferred to the
floor unit the following day.
.
1. Dyspnea: Her dyspnea was likely due to pulmonary edema
induced by hypertensive urgency, as well as demand ischemia.
She was also probably fluid overloaded by a CRI state as well.
The pts Tpn peaked at 0.27, likely secondary to  both demand
ischemia and renal insufficiency.  Nitro gtt was titrated on day
of admission to the pt being chest pain free, and it was
discontiued on [**12-19**]. The pt received HD on [**12-18**] and [**12-20**],
alleviating much of her fluid overload.  Repeat portable CXR on
[**12-20**] revealed interval improvement in her CHF.  The pt was
maintained on ASA.  Her metoprolol was ultimately titrated to
Toprol XL 300 mg po qd.
.
2. Chest pain/Elevated Cardiac Enzymes: Pt again c/o chest pain
today [**12-20**], but no EKG changes and no elevation in CE from
prior (Tpn 0.08).  The pt presented with c/o chest pain in the
setting of hypertensive urgency.  While in the MICU, her Tpn
peaked at 0.27, CK peak 282, MB peak 8; likely due to renal
insufficiency and demand ischemia.  There was probably some
element of demand ischemia in the setting of volume overload,
tachycardia, and hypertensive urgency.  Nitro gtt was titrated
in MICU for CP,  and discontinued [**12-18**].  A heparin gtt was
started on admission, but discontinued on [**12-18**] as it was felt
the pt did not have an ACS.  The pt was continued on aspirin.
She was started on lipitor 80 mg po qd in the setting of
elevated cardiac enzymes.  Her lipid profile was as follows: LDL
60, T Chol 135, HDL 65.  Lisinopril was started on [**12-18**] at 10 mg
po qd and was titrated up to 20 mg po qd prior to discharge.
Metoprolol was titrated up to Toprol XL 300 mg po qd.  The pt
has several likely episodes of chest pain on [**12-20**] (due to
language barrier, there was some confusion as to the pts
symptoms), however all EKGs were unchanged and her cardiac
enzymes were unchanged from prior.  The pt seemed to have some
chest wall tenderness to palpation at this time.  Consideration
may be given to a cardiac stress test in several months as an
outpatient once the pt is in a less debilitated state.
.
2. ESRD: The pts ESRD is felt to be secondary to diabetic
nephropathy.  The pt normally receieves HD Tues/Th/Sat. She
received 2 HD treatments while in-house. The pts pulmonary edema
(in setting of hypertensive urgency) was felt to be partially
induced by being in an overall volume overloaded state (from
CRI).  The pt was continued on nephrocaps, calcium acetate,
cinacalcet.
.
3. CHF: The pt has mild diastolic dysfunction in the setting of
long-standing HTN. The pts diastolic dysfunction likely
compromised the pts ability to expedite forward flow in the
setting of hypertensive urgency.  The pt received HD while
in-house to decrease her overall fluid volume.  Her metoprolol
was titrated to Toprol XL 300 mg po qd to assist with rate
control and filling time.  She was started on lisinopril as well
to assist with pr
