History of Present Illness:
Dr. [**Known lastname **] is a [**Age over 90 **]y/o gentleman with dementia (bedbound, chronic
foley for BPH) and recent [**Hospital1 18**] admission [**Date range (1) 13926**] for fecal
impaction and volume depletion who initially presented to an OSH
earlier this AM due to hypoxia and is transferred here due to
concerns for septic shock.
.
After his recent admission, he was discharged to a Nursing Home.
Family notes that he has been "miserable" without his pain meds,
which were d/c'd after his fecal impaction. He has severe right
heel pain from a decubitus ulcer. Also, they noted him to be
confused and difficult to understand all day on [**3-6**], until the
evening at which point he seemed to be short of breath. He was
noted to be hypotensive 86/52, with HR 82, temp 98.8. He was
encouraged to drink fluids and his BP improved but he became
short of breath with O2 sat 86%. He was sent to an OSH.
.
At the OSH, his VS were: T 100.7 rectal, HR 84, BP 99/55, RR 32.
ABG on 100%NRB was 7.36/35/62 (O2 sat 91%). His presentation was
initially concerning for CHF exacerbation and she was treated
with Lasix, Nitro, and CPAP, as well as IV Diltiazem for
Afib/RVR. He dropped his SBP to the 70's, which was up to SBP
100 after 5L IVF. CXR suggested possible consolidation so he was
given Vancomycin and Ertapenem. Due to concern for pulmonary
infection in the setting of hypotension, he was intubated. Was
given Versed for sedation, after which he dropped pressure to 70
again. PIVx3 were placed, BP improved with IV fluids and he was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS were: HR 88, BP 107/52, POx 94% on
A/C TV 500, RR 16, PEEP 5, FiO2 50%. He was agitated and bucking
the vent so he received Midazolam 2.5mg IV after which point his
BP dropped from 112/60 to 65/45, not fluid responsive. RIJ was
placed and NE 0.1mg/kg/min was started. VS prior to transfer
were BP 105/57, HR 73, RR 14, POx on 100% on A/C, TV 600, FiO2
60%, rate 14, PEEP 5.
.
On arrival to the MICU, he is intubated and sedated.
