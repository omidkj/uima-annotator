Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue, STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac catheterization with a bare metal stent to left anterior
descending coronary artery

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F with unknown PMHx presented to [**Hospital3 4107**] this
afternoon after being found in her home, unable to get up from
toilet, complaining of fatigue. At [**Hospital1 **] she was noted to have
ST elevations on ECG in inferior and lateral leads. She was
given a full dose aspirin, high dose statin, plavix load and a
heparin bolus. She was transferred directly to the [**Hospital1 18**] cath
lab and underwent left heart catheterization. She was found to
have a tight lesion in the proximal LAD, and a BMS was deployed.
She tolerated the procedure well. She was brought to the CCU for
further monitoring. She was noted to have persistent STEs on ECG
post-catheterization.
.
On arrival to the CCU, she was tachycardic but was otherwise
stable. She had no complaints. She did not recall exactly what
prompted her ED referral and did not know why she was here. She
knew that her friend had tried calling her and that she was
unable to come to the phone but is unable to tell me more than
that. She denies current chest pain or having ever had chest
pain. No SOB, DOE, PND, orthopnea. No syncope or presyncope. No
palpitations. She notes that she has had slight bilateral lower
extremity swelling for the past three days. Other ROS is
negative.

C.CATH Study Date of [**2170-12-31**] 1. Selective coronary angiography
of this right dominant system demonstrated single vessel
coronary artery disease.  The LMCA was without significant
disease.  The LAD had 80-90% serial lesions in the proximal LAD
just before D1.  The LCx and RCA had no significant coronary
artery disease. 2. Limited resting hemodynamics demonstrated
normal systemic arterial pressure of 107/63 mmHg. 3. Successful
PTCA and stenting of the proximal LAD with a 2.5 x 28 mm
minivision BMS which was deployed at 14 ATM. The proximal stent
was post dilated with a 2.75 x 12 quantum maverick balloon at 14
ATM. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the
stent, no dissection and TIMI III flow.  (See PTCA comments) 4.
Right femoral arteriotomy site was closed with a 6 French Mynx
device. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: 1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Acute anterior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
PTCA and stenting of the proximal LAD.
.
Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2171-1-1**] at 11:56:38 AM The left
atrium is dilated. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
There is moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with mid to distal anterior and septal akinesis with
apical akinesis/dyskinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic arch is mildly dilated.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a small pericardial effusion. There is brief right
atrial diastolic collapse. Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:
30% to 35%.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F with no prior cardiac history presented with STEMI, now s/p
BMS to LAD. ECHO showed systolic CHF with EF 30-35%. Pt was
medically optimized and discharged to rehabilitation in stable
condition.
.
# CORONARIES: Single vessel CAD, s/p 2 BMS to LAD. HbA1C for
risk stratification 5.5, so WNL. Lipid panel: Cholest 111,
Triglyc 91, HDL 40, LDLcalc 53, so all within acceptable ranges.
Started high dose statin with atorvastatin 80mg PO HS for recent
MI and discharged on atorvastatin 40mg PO HS for ongoing lipid
management over high dose for risk of adverse events in this
elderly patient. Trended CEs until falling. CK peaked at 207 on
the day of transfer. Continued ASA 325mg PO daily and Plavix
75mg PO daily for thombotic PPx. Initialy beta blocker therapy
with Metoprolol Tartrate 25 mg PO BID. Discharged on Toprol XL
50mg PO daily.
.
# PUMP: Patient stated that she has a history of lower extremity
swelling over the past several weeks which is new. No echo in
our system. TTE this admisison showed EF 30-355 with apical
hypokinesis. Held off anticoagulation for apical hypokinesis
given age and risk factors. Will continue on ASA + Plavix for
antiaggregation therapy and as thrombosis PPx. Started
Lisinopril 2.5 mg PO DAILY for decreased EF and CHF.
.
# RHYTHM: Currently in sinus tachycardia with low-normal blood
pressures, given large territory of infarct tachycaridia is
likely compensatory mechanism to maintain CO. Initially held
BBlockers to avoid precipitating cardiogenic shock. Was able to
titrate up Bblockade. Telemetry showed frequent PACs. Pt very
pre-renal with falling HCT. Unclear if this is due to dilution
or hemorrhage. Ultimately believed to be due to hypovolemia.
Encouraged POs and improved.
.
# Leukocytosis: Pt with ongoing leukocytosis. Unclear if this is
due to recent MI, infection, or clonal process such as CLL. CBC
with diff with 17% lymphcytes. This m
