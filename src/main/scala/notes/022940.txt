Pertinent Results:
XRAY Left upper extremity [**2100-9-14**]:

metacarpal head.

AP pelvis and Right lower extremity [**2100-9-14**]:
IMPRESSION:

Limited evaluation of the pelvis. Within the limits, there
appears to be a widen left sacroiliac joint. Fractures of the
left superior inferior pubic ramus. CT of the pelvis is
recommended.

Comminuted fracture of the 2nd and 3rd metatarsals with
significant soft tissue swelling.

CT spine [**2100-9-15**]:
IMPRESSION: Unremarkable cervical spine CT scan. Tip of the
spinous process of C7 was not fully imaged; fracture cannot be
excluded in this locale. Otherwise unremarkable cervical spine
CT scan.

CT abdomen/pelvis [**2100-9-15**]:
IMPRESSION:
1) Sternal fracture with bilateral hemothoraces. Status post
left chest tube insertion.
2) Moderate hemoperitoneum. No solid abdominal organ laceration
or contusion identified.
3) Multiple pelvic fractures with diastatic bilateral sacroiliac
joints and amputated left lower extremity.

CT head [**2100-9-15**]:
IMPRESSION:

1) No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
2) No definite evidence of fracture, although the facial bones
are not fully imaged.
3) Bilateral air fluid levels in the maxillary sinuses and sinus
mucosal thickening as described.

Spine [**2100-9-15**]:
LUMBAR SPINE, TWO VIEWS:
No fracture. Alignment is normal.

Xray Right foot [**2100-9-20**]:
IMPRESSION: Comminuted fracture of first metatarsal with
displacement. Comminuted of second metatarsal without
displacement. Fracture of distal tibia which is not well
visualized.

XRay Right ankle [**2100-9-21**]:
IMPRESSION: Transverse fracture of medial malleolus.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient arrived in the trauma bay with an initial Hematocrit
of 14, and a blood gas significant for a pH of 6.91 and a base
deficit of 23.  The trauma panel demonstrated a pelvic fracture.
 He was had pulsitile bleeding coming from his left lower
extremity, that was completely amputated, demonstrating
pulsitile bleeding, exposed femur (approximately 10cm) and
exposed muscles, with complete loss of skin.  The patient was
given a Left chest tube that produced a rush of air.  His
initial fast was negative.  Clamps and packing were used to get
initial hemostasis, while the patient was actively resuscitated
with Lactated ringers and Blood products.  He was rushed to the
operating room for control of the hemorrhage.  After ligating
actively bleeding vessels, performing a hip disarticulation and
performing a debridement, the wound was packed and covered with
sterile materials, and the patient was transfered to the
intensive care unit.  He by that time had recieved over 20 units
of packed red blood cells and greater than 15 units of Fresh
frozen plasma.  Aggressive resucitation was continued, and a
sheet was used to stabilize his pelvis.  He was monitored
closely with serial bladder pressures. His bladder pressures
were initially in in the 30s but trended down.  Once stabilized
he was also brought to the CT Scan for films.  On post op day 1,
the patient was taken back to the operative room for debridement
of the Left stump and for an exploratory laparatomy for fluid
demonstrated on his CT scan.  A Vac drain was placed over the
stump.  He was concurrently treated with antibiotics.  Tube
feeds were started on hospital day 3(post operative days 2 and
1). He was started on a vent wean. On hospital day 6, the
patient was extubated after he bit a hole in the tube.  He also
had some gram negative rods in his sputum that was treated with
antibiotics.  His chest tubes were discontinued on Hosptial day
7.  The patient was stable for transfer to the surgical floor.
His antibiotic regimen included cipro/ceftaz.  He returned to
the operating room on hospital day 9 for revision of his Left
upper extremity fracture and for fixation of his right lower
extremity foot fracture.  The following day he went to the
operating room for placement of an external fixation device on
his pelvis.  He continued to have VAC dressing changes every [**3-9**]
days.  When he was more awake, the patient started complaining
of some vivid "flashback" dreams and requested psyciatric help.
The patient was given a sitter for his saftey until he was
evaluated by psychiatry, who felt that he had an acute stress
reaction, but was not suicidal and did not require a sitter.  he
was placed on zoloft and seroquel, and his work up also included
and EEG to rule out seizures (negative).  His sleep was much
improved with the medication.  He was seen daily by psyciatry.
He was continued on his tube feeds until he was tolerating a
regular diet, and he was doing so by hospital day 13.   He was
also seen by physical therapy and they began working with him
and setting goals.  The patient remained stable on the floor,
his antibiotics were discontinued, his white blood cell count
trended down, was being seen by physical therapy and psychiatry,
while his VAC dressing was changed every three days.  It was
granulating nicely by Hospital day 15, and plastic surgery was
consulted to look at the wound the next vac change to assess the
possibility for a skin graft.  The patient was taken to the OR
by plastic surgery on HD 23 for a split thickness skin graft to
the left leg amputation site. At discharge on HD 31 the patient
was doing well. He will be discharged to [**Hospital 1319**] rehab with
close follow up in the plastic, orthopedic, and trauma clinics.
