Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1436**]
Chief Complaint:
SHORTNESS OF BREATH

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Ms [**Known lastname 12130**] is a 71 year old woman with history of insulin
dependent diabetes, peripheral [**Known lastname 1106**] disease, hyperthyroidism
and CAD, s/p recent STEMI, s/p CABG x 4 in [**10-17**] (LIMA to LAD,
SVG to OM1, OM2 and RCA), s/p left ventricular aneurysm repair,
presenting with shortness for the last four days.
.
Patient repors she has been feeling short of breath with normal
daily activities (making her bed, going to the kitchen) that was
new. She also describes rhinorrhea, watery eyes and a dry cough.
She presented to her PCP with these complaints and she was
empirically treated for a community acquired pneumonia. Cardiac
enzymes were also drawn and patient was called to present to ED
after these returned elevated (per report 1.5, unclear if Tn T
or I).
.
Patient denies any chest pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness,
light headedness, palpitations, syncope or pre-syncope. She does
point out however that she has never had symptoms with any of
her heart attacks but rather that these present with URI
symptoms.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism. She does report
excessive bleeding previously after a cardiac cath performed at
[**Hospital1 336**] complicated by RP bleed. No excessive bleeding after recent
bypass however. Denies any hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
but does report chronic bilateral ankle edema. Denies
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
.
In the ED, VS 97.1, Bp 140/84, HR 108, RR24. patient given ASA,
BB, and started on IV heparin. Admitted for further evaluation.

Pertinent Results:
EKG: ([**2116-12-26**])
NSR at 87 with incomplete right bundle branch block, TWI at aVL,
I and V2, with 1mm ST elevation in V2-V3.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM: ([**2116-12-26**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) secondary to severe
hypokinesis of the anterior septum and anterior free wall, with
extensive apical akinesis and focal apical dyskinesis (no
definite apical thrombus seen but cannot exclude with
certainty). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal hypokinesis of
the apical free wall. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There
are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2116-10-5**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is
further depressed, secondary to extensive hypokinesis of the
anterior septum and anterior free wall.

ETT: ([**2116-12-23**])
Ramping cycle ergometer protocol, 3 mins
INTERPRETATION: This 71 yo woman (h/o silent NSTEMI and s/p CABG
on
[**2116-10-12**]) was referrred to the lab for evaluation. The patient

completed 3.75 minutes on a ramping cycle ergometer protocol and
was
stopped due to marked shortness of breath and fatigue. This
represents a limited exercise tolerance for her age (~ 3.5
METS). The patient denied any neck, chest, arm or back
discomfort throughout the study. No significant ST segment
changes were noted from baseline. The rhythm was sinus with one
single VPB noted in recovery. Appropriate increased in blood
pressure noted with exercise. Blunted heart rate response to
exercise in the presence of beta-blockade therapy.
IMPRESSION: Marked shortness of breath noted at a low workload.
No
ischemic EKG changes noted.

CARDIAC CATH: ([**2116-12-29**])
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Occluded SVG-OM venous conduits
4. Moderate mitral regurgitation.
.
CARDIAC CATH: ([**2116-12-31**])
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful placement of an IABP via the left femoral artery.
3. Successful PTCA and stenting of the left main - proximal left

circumflex with a Xience drug eluting stent.
4.  Successful PTCA of the proximal left anterior descending
artery.
.
CHEST X-RAY:
Personal review demonstrates partially rotated film with blunted
left costophrenic angle and right lower lobe opacity, with
minimal change from prior in [**10-17**] (with exception of left
sublavian line which not present now).

Brief Hospital Course:
71 year old woman with insulin dependent diabetes, 3 vessel CAD
s/p CABG, presenting with dyspnea and NSTEMI found to have
occlusion of 3 of 4 by-pass grafts now s/p LCX stenting and PTCA
of the LAD now transferred to the CCU with IABP.
.
# ACS/ NSTEMI: Initial cardiac catherization showed restenosis
of bypass grafts (except SVG-RCA) not felt to be repeat surgical
candidate and thus underwent LCX stenting and PTCA to LAD.  She
had an intra-aortic baloon pump placed overnight and was
transferred to the ccu.  There her balloon pump was weaned
easily over the first day.  Medical management of CAD including
heparin gtt, plavix, ASA, statin were continued.
.
# Acute SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE: Admitted with systolic heart
failure and s/p diuresis with lasix gtt. Patient improved after
diuresis and was w
