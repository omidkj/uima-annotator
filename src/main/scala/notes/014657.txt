Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
pacer/defibrillator end of life

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Biventricular Pacemaker/defibrillator Placement, 2 Ventricular
leads  via left thoracotomy
ICD Wire Extraction


History of Present Illness:
This is a 53-year-old man who underwent implantation of a
[**Company 1543**] biventricular ICD on [**2099-8-21**] at [**Hospital3 **]. In
[**2102-4-11**] was involved in a fight and had knife wound to left
shoulder which completely lacerated his LV lead and subclavian
vein, requiring urgent vascular repair at [**Hospital1 2025**]. He was scheduled
to have LV lead replaced last [**Month (only) 116**] but left the EP lab holding
area at [**Hospital3 **] when told the surgical risks during consent.
He is now found to have end of life indicators and admitted to
[**Hospital3 2568**]. On [**12-29**] he underwent explantation of his BiV ICD
generator and explantation of the proximal portion of a
lacerated left ventricular lead. Also attempted was LV lead
replacement, however, significant stenosis of left subclavian
vein was found and LV lead replacement attempts failed due to
possible coronary vein stenosis (had to try to implant new lead
alongside old lead because old lead was lacerated deep in
shoulder, near the vein, and could not be found during
exploration). He was transferred here for new BiV ICD placement.

Brief Hospital Course:
 This 53 year old  male with a history of non-ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20% was transferred
from [**Hospital6 1597**] for lead extraction and placement of a
new biventricular pacer defibrillator.
He underwent failed BiV ICD lead placement at [**Hospital3 2568**] prior to
transfer.
He was continued on lisinopril, spironolactone and Coreg  at
home doses.

On [**1-1**] he was taken to the operating room where a new
biventricular pacer defibrillator was implanted.  A left
thoracotomy approach was utilized to place the LV leads.The
procedure was well tolerated and CTs were removed the first day
after surgery and he was transferred to the floor. Dilaudid PCA
was given.

On the 23rd he was noted to have moderate swelling of the left
arm and ultrasound was performed to rule out thrombophlebitis.
The arm and hand were significantly improved the next day with
elevation. PCA was discontinued and oral analgesics were given.
The wound was healing well and he was discharged home, to be
followed as an outpatient.
