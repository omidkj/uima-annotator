History of Present Illness:
This is a 62 year old man with a complicated cardiac history
including AVR/CABG in [**2111**] and redo sternotomy,
AVR(homograft)/MVR(tissue)/CABG in [**2113**] secondary to Staph. epi
endocarditis. Postoperative course in [**2113**] was complicated by
HIT resulting in left TMA and right 3rd and 4th metatarsal
amputation, and placement of permanent pacemaker.
.
He was his USOH until a recent admission at the [**Hospital1 789**] VA
for shortness of breath. He underwent thoracentesis and
paracentesis for pleural effusions and ascites thought to be
attributed from progressive aortic insufficiency.
.
He was then admitted from [**2116-12-22**] to [**2116-12-30**] to [**Hospital1 18**] for
evaluation of operative management of severe aortic
regurgitation. Hospitalization was complicated by contrast
nephropathy from cardiac catheterization. His diuretics were
held after that admission due to his acute renal insufficiency.
.
He subsequently required readmission from [**2117-1-5**] to [**2117-1-8**] to
[**Hospital1 18**] for recurrent congestive heart failure. Underwent a
right-sided thoracentesis and restarted on diuretics. Eventually
discharged on home oxygen.
.
Despite medical therapy, he presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2117-1-10**]
with worsening fatigue, malaise, and generalized weakness. He
denied increased dyspnea but noted that home oxygen helped. He
also denied worsening orthopnea and PND. He was readmitted for
further evaluation and treatment.

.
[**2117-1-20**] Intraop TEE: Prebypass
Aortic Valve - aortic homograft in place Severe (4+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The regurgitation is transvalvular..
Tricuspid Valve - severe tricuspid regurgitation, the etiology
of the Regurgitation is a dilated annulus. Mitral Valve -
bioprosthetic valve in place, with a mean gradient of 4 mmhg and
valve area of 2.7 cm2. Right ventricle - severe RV free wall
hypokinesis, with RV Dilatation. Left Ventricle - dilated,with
hypokinesis of the inferior and inferoseptal walls, the LVEF
40-50%.
.
[**2117-1-22**] Intraop TEE: This is a limited study with poor windows
to monitor patient as his chest is being closed s/p re-do
sternotomy. He is on very high doses of pressors (Neo and Levo)
and Epi @ 0.02 mcg/kg/min. There is a prosthetic mitral valve
with no MR, and a residual mean gradient of 6 mmHg. There is a
prosthetic aortic valve with no leak, no AI and a residual mean
gradient of 30 mmHg. The RV is not seen well enough to comment
on it. Overall LV systolic fxn. Is mildly depressed with an EF
of 40 - 45%. The anterior wall moves well, while the inferior
wall if akinetic. The tricuspid annuloplasty is not well seen
but there appears to be little or no TR.
.
[**2117-1-27**] Upper Extremity Ultrasound: Nonocclusive thrombus within
the right cephalic vein. No thrombus is seen involving the deep
veins of the right upper extremity.
.
[**2117-1-27**] Abd Ultrasound: Normal appearance of the liver, without
evidence of biliary obstruction. Gallbladder wall edema, right
pleural effusion, and small ascites, all  suggesting third
spacing. Limited evaluation of midline structures secondary to
overlying bowel gas.
.
[**2117-1-28**] Transthoracic Echo: Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20 %). The right ventricle
is also severely hypokinetic. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. A bioprosthetic mitral valve prosthesis
is present. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
[**2117-1-29**] Barium Swallow: Barium passes freely through the
oropharynx and esophagus without evidence of obstruction. There
is mild penetration of nectar and trace aspiration of thin
liquids. There is residue with all consistencies. There is
swallowing initiation delay.
