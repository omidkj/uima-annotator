Imaging:
[**2134-6-1**] CXR: There may be some atelectasis in the right lower
lobe, but lung volumes are generally normal, and the portions of
the lungs are not obscured by cardiac silhouette, appear clear.
There is no pleural effusion. Heart is borderline enlarged,
exaggerated by mediastinal fat. Lordotic positioning exaggerates
caliber of the upper mediastinum, which the CT scan showed is
infiltrative with fat.

[**2134-6-2**] CXR: Nonphysiologic straightening of the walls of the
lower trachea and main bronchi are the only indication of the
tracheobronchial Y-stent, which is barely radiopaque. New
heterogeneous opacification in the right lower lobe is
consistent with substantial aspiration or developing pneumonia.
The lungs are otherwise clear. Heart size top normal. There is
no pleural effusion or evidence of central adenopathy. ET tube
and nasogastric tube are in standard placements. No pneumothorax

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 431**] was admitted to the interventional
pulmonology/thoracic surgery service following a Rigid
bronchoscopy, flexible bronchoscopy, Y silicone stent placement
(#16 with a tracheal limb of 6.5 cm,  left mainstem limb of 2.5
cm and a right mainstem limb of 1.1 cm.) on [**2134-6-1**].  Post-
procedure she was doing well, althought 8 hrs after developed
acute respiratory distress, failed NIV and required endotracheal
intubation. She also had low urine output, which she received
2-250cc LR boluses and Lasix.  She was transferred to the
surgical ICU for close monitoring and care.  On POD 1 ([**6-2**]) she
underwent a bedside flexible bronchoscopy with clearing of a
mucous plug.  A chest xray showed likely pneumonia and she was
started on vancomycin and levaquin.  She was able to be
extubated and was continued on BIPAP for respiratory support.
ON POD 2 ([**6-3**]) she was tolerating 02 by nasal cannula and she
was started on a diet and transferred to the floor.  The
vancomycin was d/c'd and she was continued on Levaquin.  She was
also started on Prednisone 60mg to be tapered over 2 weeks.  She
was continued on advair, mucinex, albuterol/mucomyst nebs,
spiriva and nebulized saline with chest PT.  She continued to do
well on the floor and was seen by physical therapy who
recommended outpatient pulmonary rehab.  Her prednisone was
slowly tapered and she was given a prescription for a continued
taper at d/c. She was ambulating well, voiding normally and
tolerating a regular diet.  She was restarted on Lovenox on [**6-3**]
and given a 5mg dose of Coumadin on [**6-4**].  Her INR at discharge
was 1.3.  She will have an INR drawn Monday and follow up with
her previous coumadin clinic for dosing.  She will continue
Lovenox until her INR>2.0.    She was stable for discharge home
on [**2134-6-5**].  She will continue on her home 02.  She will
continue on levaquin for a total of 8 days and was given a
prescription and contact information for pulmonary rehab.  She
will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**2-28**] weeks.
