Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3561**]
Chief Complaint:
Edema, dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right and left heart catherizations
PICC placement [**2173-4-7**]


History of Present Illness:
57 yo male with afib, venous insufficiency, significant UGIB,
who presents to Dr.[**Name (NI) 5452**] office today with c/o worsening
dyspnea and increasing weight gain and edema. He denies
orthopnea or PND. He was told to have a sleep study, but he has
not had that. He states he has alot of medical problems, but
none of them are to the point where it concerns him. He denies
any back or neck pain. He's had venous insufficiency and ulcers
associated with that for a while, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
of vascular for that. In Dr.[**Name (NI) 5452**] clinic, an echo was performed
which showed e/o right heart strain and ? cor pulmonale. He was
referred to our ED for further eval.

In ED, initial vitals were 61, 112/85, mid 80s on RA, and then
increased to 95% on 4L. He was noted to have bilateral crackles
and anasarca on exam. A CTA was performed which was negative for
PE. The patient was then admitted for volume overload. He was
not given lasix in the ED in case a cath was to be performed in
the AM.
ECG was afib without any ischemic changes. cardiac enzymes were
not very remarkable.

On floor, patient was comfortable. he denied chest pain or SOB.
he confirmed above.

On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myalgias, joint
pains, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. he denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. he denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.

Past Medical History:
1. Atrial fibrillation not anticoagulated since significant GIB
2. History of alcohol abuse.
3. Hypertension.
4. Upper gastrointestinal bleed in [**2167-7-7**] secondary to
prepyloric ulcer.
5. Psoriasis.
6. Mitral valve prolapse.
7. Gastric biopsy in [**2163-2-7**] showing esophagitis and
gastritis, H-pylori negative.
8. The patient had repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy in
[**2167-10-7**] showing evidence of gastritis, however, a
healed prepyloric ulcer.
9. Adrenal insuffiency diagnosed in [**2172**] and on hydrocortizone
replacement therapy.


Social History:
The patient currently works part time as a spanish teacher at
middle school. He has smoked a half a pack per day of tobacco
times 30 years.  He reports occasional alcohol use, but has a
history of alcohol abuse in the past. He denies any other drug
use.

.
CTA [**2173-3-24**]:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection.
2. Nodular shrunken hepatic contour, could reflect chronic
passive congestion and/or liver disease. clinical correlation is
advised.
3. Unchanged left hepatic lobe hypoattenuation, could reflect a
simple cyst.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions, anasarca and ascites, in the
setting of cor pulmonale is probably secondary to right heart
failure.
.
Arterial Doppler [**2173-3-25**]:
Doppler evaluation was performed of both lower extremity
arterial systems at rest. On the right, Doppler tracings are
triphasic at the femoral, popliteal and dorsalis pedis. They are
absent at the posterior tibial. Ankle brachial index is 1.08.
Pulse volume recordings are mildly decreased at the ankle and
metatarsal. Left Doppler tracings are triphasic at the femoral,
popliteal, and posterior tibial levels. They are monophasic at
the dorsalis pedis.  Ankle brachial index is 0.94. Pulse volume
recordings show mild drop off at the ankle and metatarsal.
IMPRESSION: Mild bilateral tibial artery occlusive disease.
.
Abdominal utlrasound [**2173-3-25**]:
1. Very heterogeneous liver with no solid liver mass identified.

2. Hyperdynamic pulsatile bidirectional flow seen in all of the
portal veins.
Large hepatic vein. These findings suggest tricuspid
insufficiency.
3. Sludge in the gallbladder.
4. Small amount of ascites.
.
Cardiac echo [**2173-3-26**]:
This study was compared to the prior study of [**2170-10-9**].
LEFT ATRIUM: Moderate LA enlargement.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Markedly dilated RA. The IVC is
dilated (>2.5cm)
LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Mildly dilated LV cavity.
Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall normal LVEF (>55%). No resting
LVOT gradient. No VSD.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Dilated RV cavity. RV function depressed.
Abnormal diastolic septal motion/position consistent with RV
volume overload.
AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Aortic valve not well seen.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild
mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Moderate [2+] TR. Moderate PA systolic
hypertension.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
CONCLUSIONS:
Suboptimal image quality. Images insufficient to exclude an ASD
or PFO.The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium
is markedly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Due
to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed
free wall contractility. There is abnormal diastolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
overload. The aortic valve is not well seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion. Suboptimal image quality. Agitated saline
could not be seen in the right atrium after injection.
