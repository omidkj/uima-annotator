LLE XRAY: Age indeterminate fracture involving the lateral
malleolus as
described above.  Question possible nondisplaced fracture of the
distal tibia. Given severity of osteoporosis, MR is recommended
over CT if further imaging is required to corroborate finding.
.
[**10-28**] Echo: Image quality is suboptimal due to body habitus,
supine position, and  mechanical ventilation. The left atrium is
dilated. Left ventricular wall  thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. The overall left ventricular
ejection fraction appears relatively well-preserved  (at least
50%); the inferior and posterior walls may be hypokinetic. Due
to  suboptimal technical quality, other focal wall motion
abnormalities cannot be  fully excluded. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are  normal. The number of
aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic  valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. The  mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse.
Mild to moderate ([**2-7**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
[2+] tricuspid  regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic  hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.  Compared with the findings of the prior study (images
reviewed) of [**2124-6-27**], the inferior and posterior walls may
now be hypokinetic.
.
[**10-27**] Cath: . Selective coronary angiography revealed a right
dominant system with LMCA free of obstructive disease. The LAD
and LCX had modest diffuse disease. RCA had a hazy mid vessel
70% lesion. 2. Left ventriculography was deferred. 3.
Hemodynamic assessment revealed atrial fibrillation at 130 with
hypotension. PCWP was elevated at 30 mm Hg and RAp 19 mm Hg.
There was moderate pulmonary hypertension.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe systolic ventricular dysfunction and shock.
3. Acute inferior myocardial infarction, managed by acute ptca.
4. PTCA of  vessel.

ECG Study Date of [**2124-10-28**]  9:18:20 AM

previous tracing

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2124-10-29**] 7:04 AM
IMPRESSION: Improved fluid balance with moderate-to-severe
persisting interstitial and alveolar edema. The more confluent
opacity in the left lung base also persists. Again, this may be
manifestation of confluent edema or focus of pneumonia.
Continued radiographic followup with progressive diuresis
recommended to assess for underlying infection.
.
PICC LINE PLACMENT SCH  [**2124-11-6**] 7:27 AM
IMPRESSION: Successful placement of 30-cm single-lumen 4 French
PICC line from right basilic vein with the tip terminating in
distal SVC. The line is ready for use.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2124-11-1**] 7:06 AM
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**10-27**] through 26:
.
Mild pulmonary edema has improved, particularly in the right
lung. Mild cardiomegaly is chronic. Pleural effusion if any is
minimal, on the left. No pneumothorax.
.
ANKLE (2 VIEWS) LEFT  [**2124-11-1**] 8:24 PM
FINDINGS: Two portable radiographs of the left ankle were
reviewed. There is a distal fibular fracture with posterior
angulation. There is no marked interval change from [**10-29**], [**2124**]. There is also abnormal angulation of the distal tibia
suggesting buckle fracture. Age is indeterminate, but unchanged
from [**2124-10-29**]. Given severe osteopenia, evaluation is
limited.
.
IMPRESSION: Unchanged appearance of distal tibia and fibula with
angulated fibular fracture and possible tibial fracture. Severe
osteopenia.

Brief Hospital Course:
72 yo with extensive PMH, to include h/o CAD s/p PTCA to RCA,
diastolic CHF (EF 70-80%), chronic afib on Coumadin who
presented with L fibula fracture and SOB, found to have STE in
III and AVF, s/p PCI to RCA for hazy 70% occlusion.
