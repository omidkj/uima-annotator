Imaging:
[**12-1**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Increased opacification of the right lung concerning
for
worsening infectious process. Persistent left basilar opacity as
well, which could represent an area of atelectasis but infection
is also not excluded.
.
[**12-5**] CXR: IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-9**] through
[**12-3**]: Moderate cardiomegaly has increased since [**12-1**], accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion. Previous
consolidation in the right upper lobe has improved. No
appreciable pleural effusion. Tracheostomy tube in standard
placement. Left PIC catheter points into the right
brachiocephalic vein.
.
[**12-1**] EKG: Artifact is present. There is arm lead reversal.
Sinus tachycardia. There are ST-T wave changes. Compared to the
previous tracing arm lead reversal is new.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 11622**] is a 27 year old man with Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] Syndrome,
chronic restrictive/obstructive lung disease, recurrent
hospitalization for pneumonia, who presents with shortness of
breath and pneumonia
.
# Pseudomonas pneumonia: Mr [**Known lastname 86060**] SOB and hypoxia was
accomanpied by a new RLL infiltrate, consistent with pneumonia.
On admission he was still taking IV vancomycin and meropenum for
PNA from his last admission. A mini-BAL was performed which grew
pseudomonas. He was originally treated with meropenem and
tobramycin. However, sensitivities revealed that it was
resistent to [**Last Name (un) 2830**], therefore he was switched to ceftazidime. ID
was consulted. Tobra is administered on a q24h interval. The
patient was discharged on tobra and ceftazidime to complete a 21
day course starting from [**2129-12-5**]. Please draw the following
labs twice weekly (start [**2129-12-12**]): CBC with diff, LFTs, BUN, Cr,
ESR, CRP, Tobra trough (30 minutes prior to dose) All
