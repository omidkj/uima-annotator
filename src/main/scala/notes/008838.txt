Admission Date:  [**2131-8-20**]     Discharge Date:  [**2131-8-26**]


Service:  [**Location (un) **] MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  An 85-year-old male with a
history of CAD, MR, and hypertension presented with dyspnea
and left flank pain for two days.  He awoke one day prior to
admission with shortness of breath at rest.  The shortness of
breath increased with exertion (climbing stairs).  Patient
denied palpitations, chest pain, fever, chills, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea.  Patient also complained of right flank
pain that was intermittent and dull.  The patient denied
hematuria or dysuria.

In the Emergency Department, the patient's blood pressure was
90/50 with no response with fluid bolus.  He got dobutamine
which was discontinued as his blood pressure rapidly returned
to systolic of 127.

radiating to axilla.  Lungs:  Crackles bilaterally [**1-22**] of the
way up.  Abdomen:  Thin with normoactive bowel sounds, soft,
nontender, and nondistended, 3 cm pulsatile abdominal mass.
Extremities:  1+ pedal edema bilaterally.  Back:  Positive
right CVA tenderness.

LABORATORY STUDIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 11.3
with 83% polys, 0 bands, 8 lymphocytes, 7 monocytes, 2
eosinophils, 0 basophils, hematocrit 37.0, platelets 215.
Sodium 145, potassium 4.1, chloride 112, bicarb 22, BUN 52,
creatinine 2.9 (2.3 in [**2131-1-20**]).  Glucose 120,
calcium 8.6, magnesium 2.8, phosphorus 2.9.  CK 209, troponin
0.01.

CT of the abdomen without contrast showed an abdominal and
thoracic aortic aneurysm without evidence of rupture,
pulmonary fibrosis, and renal cyst.  Coarsened trabeculae in
the right femoral head with question osteopenia.

EKG:  Initially in rapid AFib, then with PVCs, left
ventricular hypertrophy, no ST-T wave changes.

Echocardiogram in [**4-/2125**]:  EF of 40%, mild dilatation
positive MR.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was initially
admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] service, where he was diuresed with
Lasix, but continued to have intermittent shortness of
breath.  On [**2131-8-21**], his oxygen requirements increased with
decreased oxygen sats, satting 86% on 100% nonrebreather.  He
was placed on a Heparin drip for AFib and question of
pulmonary embolus.  We were unable to do a CTA/PE protocol
secondary to chronic renal failure; V/Q scan was felt to be
unlikely to be helpful given the patient's underlying lung
disease.  Patient was transferred to the MICU for worsening
pulmonary status.  Upon transfer, his blood pressure held
fairly well, however, he required dopamine and multiple fluid
boluses.  He was noted to have runs of AFib with rapid
ventricular response in the 130s.

A second echocardiogram was performed which showed mild
regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, abnormal
inferior wall motion, 4+ MR, 2+ TR, right ventricular [**Last Name (LF) 16089**],
[**First Name3 (LF) **] of greater than 60%.  His cardiac enzymes continued to
rise.

He had a chest CAT scan on [**2131-8-22**] that showed severe
coronary calcification, moderately enlarged heart with an
enlarged PA that was unchanged from prior studies.  There
were scattered paratracheal lymph nodes up to 1 cm, small
dilatation of the aorta and bilateral pleural effusions that
were new compared to a study from [**2131-8-20**] with an
increased density and severely fibrotic parenchyma.  A CAT
scan of his abdomen showed a small amount of air in the
biliary tree, the liver, pancreas, spleen, and adrenals, and
bowels were unremarkable.  There was enumerable simple renal
cysts bilaterally, dilated infrarenal aorta, and a small
amount of fluid around the liver.  There is a right inguinal
hernia noted that was not obstructed.

Patient developed a metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate.
A Renal consult was obtained, who recommended bicarbonate for
lactic acidosis.  They felt his acute renal failure and
chronic renal failure was likely secondary to ischemic ATN
with underlying on chronic renal failure likely secondary to
hypertension nephropathy.  Recommended holding further
diuresis at this time and continue on bicarbonate drip.

On [**2131-8-23**], the patient into sustained AFib with a rate into
140s and no response to vagals.  Patient was changed to
Neo-Synephrine from dopamine given concern for
arrhythmogenicity of dopamine.  However, on Neo-Synephrine
drip his hypotension became more pronounced with systolic
blood pressures in the 80s.  Patient was placed back on
dopamine and the Neo-Synephrine was weaned off.  He continued
to experience hypotension and vasopressin was added.

Cardioversion was attempted with 100 jolts, however, he has
continued on AFib with rapid ventricular rate and
hypotension.

On the evening of [**2131-8-23**] patient did well, however, weaning
off all pressors including dopamine and vasopressin.
However, patient again developed hypotension with several
episodes of SVT.

On [**2131-8-26**], he had deterioration on his condition and was on
three pressors with continued hypotension and acidosis with
increased lactate and decreased urine output.  Per discussion
with the family and the [**Hospital 228**] health care proxy, the
decision was made to make the patient comfort measures only
and to discontinue the ventilator.  Shortly after
discontinuation of the ventilator, the patient underwent
asystole with fixed pupils, no spontaneous respirations, or
palpable pulses.

Time of death:  1:55 p.m.  His family was notified and
declined a postmortem.
