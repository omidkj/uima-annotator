History of Present Illness:
57 y/o F with h/o breast CA, DM I, polyendocrine deficiency type
I including Addison's disease, hypoparathyroidism, premature
ovarian failure, depression sent to ED from [**Hospital3 537**] after
found unresponsive after ?overdosing on tylenol with codeine
(was found with open bottle Tylenol #3, note asking for
transport to [**Hospital1 2025**] per EMS report). On field, pupils were sluggish
2-3 mm but responsive, HR 100, RR 4, no audible BP, pt pale,
cool and diaphoretic. Given 1 mg IV narcan in field x 2 with no
good effect, vomited several times. In ED, on arrival T 96.8, BP
172/76, HR 103, RR 16, Sat 92% on unclear amount of oxygen. SBP
shortly therafter dropped to 58/46, started on dopamine
peripherally at 8 cc/hr and also given 10 mg IV decadron,
Anzemet IV, 500 mg Levofloxacin IV x 1, 500 mg IV flagyl x 1,
8250 mg IV NAC. In ED, RR improved and was given narcan x 2 with
good effect. Tylenol level 206 and lac 7.0. Pt was admitted to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management. Of note, pt was DNR/DNI per report
from brother and [**Hospital3 **] supervisor which pt apparently
put in the last two weeks.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], on dopamine at 10 mcg/min which was
increased to 20 mcg since SBP still in 90s. Pt was awake and
alert on arrival and told us that she "did not expect to wake
up" and took 80 pills of Tylenol with codeine.

CT Abd and Pelvis:
1.  No evidence of intra-abdominal or significant groin hematoma
on either side.
2.  Markedly distended gallbladder, which could be seen in a
fasting state.
3.  Nonspecific thickening of the cecum, with small amount of
stranding and fluid in the right pararenal fascia and right
pericolic gutter.
4.  Stranding and fluid around the presacral space and about the
rectum, also nonspecific.
5.  Right hip effusion.
.
CXR [**6-15**]:
INDICATION:  Repositioning of right subclavian line.
.
A right subclavian catheter has been withdrawn several
centimeters, and now terminates within the lower superior vena
cava.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is new opacity in the
left retrocardiac region, likely atelectasis, although
aspiration is an additional consideration.  There is otherwise
no substantial change from a recent radiograph of a few hours
earlier.
.
Non-Contrast Head CT, [**6-14**]:
FINDINGS:  Very unusual widely disseminated curvilinear shaped
calcifications are seen within the subcortical white matter of
both cerebral hemispheres. Additionally, somewhat conglomerate
punctate calcifications are noted within the lentiform nuclei,
with faint calcifications seen in both dentate nuclei. There is
no sign for an intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or
hydrocephalus, minor or major vascular territorial infarction.
No overt extracranial abnormalities are seen.
.
CONCLUSION:  Unusual, presumably dystrophic calcifications
within the brain as noted above.  Either a degenerative disorder
or metabolic abnormality involving calcium and phosphorus could
be considered.  Too more comprehensively exclude metastatic
neoplastic disease not large enough to produce either edema or
mass effect, a followup contrast-enhanced MR study has been
suggested, via transmission of this recommendation to the ED
dashboard.

EKG:NSR at 88 bpm, nl axis, QTC 378, nl intervals, no ST changes
