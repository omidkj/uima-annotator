PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vitals Pulse 80, blood pressure 90/49,
respirations 24, 02 sat 100% NRB.  This is an uncomfortable
female with distended, tympanitic abdomen with diffuse
guarding, greatest in the epigastric area.  Coffee ground NGT
aspirate.  Guaiac positive stool.  No bright red blood per
rectum.  Of note:  Umbilical hernia.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC:  WBC 4.5, hematocrit 33.2, platelets
455, N44, Bd29, L24, Chem: Na 134, Cl 96, BUN 41, potassium
5.0, C02 23, creatinine 3.3.  ABG:  Metabolic acidosis.
Cardiac enzymes:  Within normal limits x 1 on admission.
Liver enzymes:  Within normal limits except for amylase 246
and lipase 1320.

Chest x-ray:  Significant for free intraperitoneal air.  EKG:
Normal paced rhythm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Initial course, patient given fluid
resuscitation, started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and
taken to the OR for emergent exploratory laparotomy.
Intraoperatively, the abdomen was found to be filled with
purulent material.  A 1 cm perforation in the anterior
duodenum was identified and was repaired with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
A 7 cm exophytic mass was also found to be emanating from the
left hepatic lobe.  An intraoperative consult was obtained
and the mass was removed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Of note:  On
pathology, the liver mass was determined to be a hemangioma.
Postoperatively, the patient was transferred to the SICU and
was discharged fro the SICU to the General Floor on POD#3.
Respiratory:  The patient was initially kept intubated
postoperatively in order to protect airway until metabolic
acidosis corrected. She was extubated on POD #1.  Patient
experienced wheezing which was improved by albuterol
nebulizer.  Cardiology:  Rhythm - Pacemaker interrogated on
HD#1, POD#0 and found to be functioning normally.  Pump:
Patient experienced some increased difficulty breathing on
POD#5 and was found to have evidence of worsening CHF.  The
patient was started on Lasix.  Cardiac enzymes/EKG were
checked on POD#8 and there was no evidence of myocardial
infarction as precipitant for worsening CHF.  Patient managed
on Lasix and was eventually able to be taken off Lasix prior
to discharge.  Patient was placed on a perioperative beta
blocker.  ID:  Patient was initially on Ampicillin,
Levofloxacin, Flagyl and Fluconazole for broad-spectrum
coverage.  Peritoneal swabs grew micrococcus/Stomatococcus.
Above antibiotics were continued.  On POD#7, patient spiked a
temperature to 101.8.  Cultures were done and CT was done to
rule out abscess.  Central line culture was initially
reported as positive for gram positive cocci so patient was
changed from ampicillin to Vancomycin to cover possible MRSA
however further reporting described mixed flora and
Vancomycin was discontinued.  Broad-spectrum antibiotics were
discontinued on POD#11.  Patient found to have H. pylori.
Treatment for this was begun with Clarithromycin and
amoxicillin when patient was able to take PO on HD#11.
Patient should continue this until [**2102-12-26**] along with
ongoing proton pump inhibitor.  Endocrinology:  NIDDM:
Patient's oral hypoglycemics held during the admission and
fingersticks were monitored.  Patient was given coverage by
regular insulin sliding scale.  FEN:  Patient initially
presented in acute renal failure, most likely secondary to
decreased intravascular volume.  Renal function normalized
following fluid resuscitation.  Patient initially kept NPO.
Started on TPN POD#3.  Patient began to tolerate sips of
clears on POD#11 and was advanced, tolerating diabetic diet
at discharge.  Musculoskeletal:  Patient continued to
complain of arthritis pain, but given history of duodenal
perforation decision was made to avoid further NSAID use.
Patient noted control of pain with acetaminophen and Ultram
around the clock.  Psych:  Patient placed on outpatient
medications when able to tolerate.

LINES:  RIJ triple lumen, Foley.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  As admission except Metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **]
added. Tramadol 50 mg PO q 6 hrs for arthritis pain.  All
NSAIDs discontinued.

DISPOSITION:  To [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.

diabetes mellitus Type II, depression, anxiety, dementia of
Alzheimer's type, arrhythmia, gastritis, hypotension,
