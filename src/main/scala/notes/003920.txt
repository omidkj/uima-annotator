Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1835**]
Chief Complaint:
"leukocytosis and increased LDH."

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
32-year-old woman with a history of BRAF wild-type of left
shoulder melanoma diagnosed in [**2128**], status post excision and
lymph node dissection, interferon and then reexcision with XRT
to left shoulder treated with adjuvant GM-CSF.   In short, her
oncologic history is complex and summarized below.  She was
treated with high-dose IL-2 in [**Month (only) **] and [**2135-7-7**] with
progression of disease on subsequent scan and brain metastases
in [**2135-9-7**].  This was treated with resection and
CyberKnife radiation therapy.  She was enrolled on compassionate
access ipilimumab protocol [**Numeric Identifier 47885**] in [**2136-3-6**] and received
weeks 1 through 12 between [**Month (only) 958**] and [**2136-6-6**]. However, again
brain metastases was noted in [**2136-5-6**] and underwent CyberKnife.
 Since that time she was slowly tapered off steroids and
bevacizumab was started to expedite taper off steroids to
evaluate the effect of ipilimumab.  However, given mixed
response in general progression of disease, there is dicussion
for stopping bevacizumab to determine whether she could be a
candidate for the PD-1 trial.
.
In clinic, her LDH has been significantly greater than two times
the upper limit of normal to 1344, WBC elevated to 21.2.  MRI on
[**2136-3-10**] is notable for progression of left occipital lobe
lesion has increased from 1.6 x 1.6 cm to 2.1 x 1.9 cm.  She is
planned for surgical resection on [**2137-3-14**].  However, given her
increased wbc and LDH, and SOB, she was referred for inpt workup
for SOB.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 47886**] recommended at the minimum perform repeat
LDH, coag, CXR, induced sputum to r/o PCP/PJP pneumonia,
consider bactrim, and infectious workup.
.
The patient reports that she has generally felt well in the last
several weeks.  She reports a dry cough that is non productive
that has been present since [**1-17**].  Denies changes in bowel
habits.  She does acknowledge that her father had a recent GI
illness and she had a bout of nausea and vomiting Sunday night
which was self limited.  She has had no repeat issues since
then.  The patietn denies new sexual partners and denies
discharge from her vagina or dysuria.  The patient does not
think she is pregnant and her LMP was in [**10-17**].  8 years ago the
patient had pneumonia and had previousl received the
pneumonovax.  Did not get a the flu shot because at that time
she had been on epilumumab.  ROS is positive for chronic left
hand numbness, mild epigastric soreness from vomiting several
nights ago and occasional left buttock pain.

recurrent Seizure (paralaysis): no change in right semiovale
metastatic lesion with surrounding vasogenic edema or sign of

- Admitted [**Date range (3) 47888**]: for biopsy of her brain lesion to
assess progression vs XRT necrosis/effect. Biopsy revealed:
Reactive changes consistent with radiation. She was managed with
steroids and discharged.

revealed mixed change in edema of two lesions in the brain
- [**2136-10-11**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6570**] started Avastin to help manage the
inflammation and vasogenic edema seen on MRI.
- [**2136-12-6**] last dose Avastin. Given her progression of disease on
scan in [**2136-12-6**], we discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 23804**] stopping
Avastin and modifying her anti-seizure medications as necessary
to determine whether she will be a candidate for study protocol
as there are no other immune options available for her
treatment.
