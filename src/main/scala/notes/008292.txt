Service:  CARDIAC SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67-year-old,
morbidly obese male, with a history of hypercholesterolemia,
and three prior myocardial infarctions.  The patient has had
angina for a number of years which recently has progressed.
The patient presented to an outside hospital for a cardiac
catheterization on [**2133-11-13**].  This last cardiac
catheterization showed severe three-vessel disease with an
estimated ejection fraction of approximately 23%.  Given the
patient's symptoms and findings on cardiac catheterization,
it was decided that a surgical intervention would be the best
approach.  The patient was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further evaluation and
likely surgery.

The patient denied any symptoms of shortness of breath,
orthopnea, claudication, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  He
does have a history of hypertension.  Preoperatively the
patient's FEV1 was 2.24, which was 81% of the predicted
value.  FVC was 2.91, which was 73% of the predicted value.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Myocardial infarction times three.
2.  Hypertension.  3.  Hypercholesterolemia.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  1.  Status post cholecystectomy.  2.
Appendectomy.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.,
Avapro, Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Cordarone
400 mg p.o. b.i.d., Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d., Nystatin powder
1 tab t.i.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  The patient was alert and
oriented times three in no apparent distress.  He was a
middle-aged obese male.  Vital signs:  The patient was
afebrile, heart rate 83, blood pressure 146/90, respirations
17, 94% on room air.  HEENT:  No jugular venous distention.
No bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate and rhythm.  No murmurs or
gallops.  Abdomen:  Obese but soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities:  Pulses present bilaterally in upper and lower
extremities.  No varicosities.  Neurological:  Grossly
intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission white blood cell count was
11.4, hematocrit 41.1, platelet count 220; PT 13.6, INR 1.3,
PTT 41; glucose 96, BUN 32, creatinine 1.1, calcium 8.9,
potassium 3.7, sodium 138.

The patient was placed on intravenous Heparin at the outside
hospital and was consequently transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Cardiac
Surgery Service.  He remained in stable condition
preoperatively.  On [**2133-11-16**], given the history of
coronary artery disease and also cardiomyopathy, the patient
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting times three with
left main mammary artery to left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal branch of the
circumflex, and saphenous vein graft to the posterior
descending coronary artery.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well.  There were no complications.

The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in
fair condition.  The patient remained intubated.  The
patient's heart rhythm was in sinus with frequent premature
ventricular contractions and bigeminy noticed.  The patient
was started on Amiodarone.  Neo was continued as well.  The
patient was extubated on the same day in the evening.  The
patient tolerated extubation well.  He showed good oxygen
saturation.

The patient remained in sinus rhythm on postoperative day #1.
He was able to get out of bed to chair.  At the time, he was
95-97% on 3 L nasal prongs.  He showed a strong cough with
minimal sputum production.  The patient was started on
Lopressor given tachycardia.  The Swan-Ganz catheter and the
chest tubes were removed on postoperative day #1.  The
patient remained afebrile.  His hematocrit was stable.

On postoperative day #2, the patient went into atrial
fibrillation with a heart rate in the 120s and 130s.  The
patient was diuresed appropriately.  His temperature rose to
100.0??????.  His white count increased to 20 at the time.  The
patient received perioperative doses of intravenous
Vancomycin.  Neo was restarted.  The patient was started on
intravenous Heparin for his atrial fibrillation.  He was
continued to be diuresed.  He was making adequate urine.  The
patient was also started on Coumadin.  The patient was also
loaded on Digoxin.

Physical Therapy was consulted who followed the patient
throughout his hospitalization and eventually cleared the
patient to go home.  On [**2133-11-22**], the patient
reverted to sinus rhythm.  Digoxin was discontinued.  The
patient was continued on Coumadin and intravenous Heparin.

On postoperative day #7, his incision was noted to be
draining small amounts of serous fluid in two areas.  There
was no erythema or particular tenderness.  His white blood
cell count at the time was noted to be elevated at 17.5.  The
patient was started on Keflex prophylactically.  On
postoperative day #8, the patient's white count decreased to
15.5.  The drainage decreased slightly.  The patient remained
afebrile.  The patient continued to be in sinus rhythm.
Intravenous Heparin was discontinued.

The patient was discharged to home on postoperative day #8 in
stable condition.
