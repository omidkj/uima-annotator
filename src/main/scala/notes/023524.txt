Date of Birth:                    Sex:  F

Service:  Neurology
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 10940**] was found down.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77 year old woman who
had a history of hypotension and previous stroke some 12
years ago who was last seen well at 2 PM on the day of
Technician was called where they found her to be on the floor
with right arm flexed and a paucity of movement on the right
leg.  She was not responsive to questions.  On arrival to the
Emergency Room she was vomiting profusely and therefore
intubated urgently.  A head computerized tomography scan in
the Emergency Room revealed a left thalamic hemorrhage with
some ventricular involvement.  There was mild midline shift.
She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for further
management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension
2.  Uveitis
3.  Cataract surgery
4.  Ischemic stroke some 12 years ago

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. q. day
2.  Alphagan
3.  Prednisolone eye drops
4.  Levobunolol 0.5% eye drops q. 12 hours

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives alone and has several sons and
daughters who are very involved.

FAMILY HISTORY:  No history of stroke.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs, temperature 100.5,
heartrate 64 to 120s, blood pressure 106 to 140/45 to 60,
respiratory rate 16.  She attempts to open her eyes to
noxious stimuli.  She withdraws to pain in both legs and left
arm.  The right arm is plegic.  There is no blink to threat.
Eyes are midline though she appears to have a left gaze
preference.  The left pupil was 4 mm and was surgical.  The
right pupil was 1 to 2 mm, but both are poorly reactive to
light.  There is Doll's eye.  Reflexes are 2 to 3+ and
symmetric.  The right toe is upgoing and the left toe is
downgoing.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 12, hematocrit 38.4, platelets
213.  Electrolytes, sodium 138, potassium 3.2, chloride 102,
bicarbonate 25, BUN 16, creatinine 0.6, glucose 139, PT 13,
PTT 34.  Arterial blood gases 7.46, 35, 336.  Urinalysis was
negative.  Creatinine kinase 1279, troponin 1.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 10940**] was admitted to the Neurology
Intensive Care Unit for close blood pressure control and
frequent neurological examination.  Initially she was stable
and she began to be more awake, alert and interactive and was
able to be extubated without problems.  She was able to
answer simple questions but her speech is dysarthric.  Over
the next several days, however, she became more and more
aphasic and less and less responsive with lethargy.  A repeat
computerized tomography scan showed increase in hydrocephalus
with involvement of the ventricles by hemorrhage.  Therefore,
Neurosurgery was consulted and a ventriculostomy drain was
placed in the right frontal lateral ventricle.  Her mental
status improved over the next several days.  A repeat
computerized tomography scan showed adequate decompression of
the ventricular system.  Her vent drain was clamped over the
next several days and she continued to do clinically well and
therefore the ventriculostomy was removed.

From a respiratory perspective, she had increased secretions
which required frequent suctioning.  A chest x-ray revealed a
small retrocardiac opacity and she had already been on
Cefazolin for the ventriculostomy prophylaxis and therefore
the Neurosurgery Team decided to continue that.  Her
respiratory status improved and secretions resolved.  She has
been afebrile for the past several days while in-house.

From a cardiac perspective Mrs. [**Known lastname 10940**] was evaluated with a
cardiac echocardiogram which revealed an ejection fraction of
60%, however, she did have a moderate-sized ascending aortic
aneurysm of 5.2 cm and should be followed.

We note that her family and Mrs. [**Known lastname 10940**] would like to not have
drastic measures performed on her should they become
necessary, for example cardiac and respiratory resuscitation.

On the day of discharge, Mrs. [**Known lastname 10940**] is awake, alert and
answering questions appropriately.  Her speech is dysarthric
but she is not aphasic.  The right hemiparesis has improved.
She is able to move the deltoids minimally against gravity
and the finger extensors and grasp are also against gravity.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Improved.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge to [**Hospital6 3953**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Left thalamic hemorrhage with
ventricular extension requiring ventriculostomy placement.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Hypertension
2.  Ischemic stroke from 12 years ago

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Hydralazine 100 mg p.o. q. 6 hours
3.  Diltiazem 45 mg q.i.d.
4.  Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Prednisolone 1% ophthalmic drops both eyes five times a
day
6.  Levobunolol 0.5% one drop, left eye, q. 12 hours
7.  Brimonidine 0.15% one drop, left eye, q. 12 hours
8.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
9.  Dulcolax 1 p.r. b.i.d. prn
10. Pneumatic compression devices

FOLLOW UP:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 10940**] should follow up with her primary care
