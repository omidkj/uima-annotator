Emergent ERCP

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with CBD stent placement


History of Present Illness:
60 y/o female with severe COPD and cholangitis who developed
acute onset RUQ pain 2 months ago with increased WBC and
obstructive biliary pattern. MRCP confirmed choledocholithiasis
with CBD 11mm and large number of gallstones. Symptoms resolved
spontaneously before she was instumented. Underwent elective
ERCP early [**Month (only) **] which was unsuccessful due to difficulty in
passing duodenal papilla. Post procedurally, she developed
severe pancreatitis with lipse >1000 and acute epigastic abd
pain. Repeat MRCP showed peripancreatic inflammation, dilated
CBD with stones. Admitted to ICU and supported with fluids,
dopamine, NPO/TPN, narcotics. Started on gatifloxicin for
obstructive biliary pattern. Weaned off pressors and
pancreatitis resolved. Hosp course complicated by development of
pneumonia with MRSA in sputum. Started on vanc. On [**2181-1-11**] noted
to have increased ruq pain with biliary obstructive patter,
leukocytosis with bands, and low grade fever. Transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for emergent ERCP. Received here and underwent CBD stent
placement. Transferred to MICU for observation of cholangitis
s/p CBD stent. Afebrile, HD stable, but spO2 85% on room air and
mild resp distress. Mild abdominal pain, but diffuse and not
particularly tender in RUQ. Baeline COPD is walking 15 feet
before stopping to rest. Persantine nuclear scan normal in
10/[**2179**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief Hospital Course: 60 y/o female with cholangitis, s/p
emergent ERCP with CBD stent. Course complicated by MRSA
pneumonia. Symptomatically and clinically improved on antibiotic
regimen.

1. Cholangitis - Patient was admitted with fever, increased
bilirubin and RUQ pain, and cholangtis was suspected given the
patient's history of gallstones. She went to the ERCP lab where
numerous filling defects and a 2 cm common bile duct were
observed. A stent was placed to relieve the obstruction and due
to increasnig respiratory distress the patient was transferred
to the MICU post procedure. Levo and flagyl were started on
[**2181-1-12**] for a 10 day course. Her LFT's trended down during the
hospitalization and her abdominal exam remained benign. She will
have a repeat ERCP in [**2-21**] wks to remove stent and remnant CBD
stones. She should have an elective cholecystectomy soon after
cholangitis and pneumonia have resolved completely. She will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 468**] in surgery to evaluate for this.

2. Pneumonia/COPD exacerbation - The patient was found to have a
RLL/RML infiltrate by chest X-ray and was in respiratory
distress post-procedure. Vancomycin was added to her antibiotic
regimen as she grew MRSA in her sputum from the OSH. Blood
cultures were negative. Her respiratory status gradually
improved during her stay in the MICU and she did not require
intubation. She was treated with frequent nebulizers,
fluticasone, and IV solumedrol as well as a planned 14 day
course of vancomycin for her MRSA pneumonia. 14 day course was
completed on [**2181-1-18**]. F/U CXR on [**1-16**] showed persistent RML/RLL
opacities. However, patient had symptomatic improvement and was
weaned off oxygen to room air. Productive cough also resolved.
Of note her baseline O2 is 86-88% on room air. She will
follow-up in clinic in 3 weeks for repeat CXR.

3. Glucose - She was noted to be hyperglycemic during the
hospitalization with sugars over 300, in the setting of steroid
treatment. She was covered with sliding scale insulin and
lantus, which will be tapered over the next 2 weeks. Her
hemoglobin A1C of 6.6 suggests borderline diabetes which can be
monitored as an outpatient.

4. HTN - normotensive off of anti-hypertensives. held in the
setting of recent infection. will consider re-starting as
outpatient.

5. Hypothyroid - continued on synthroid

6. Low back pain - treated with percocet 10/650 q8h prn

7. FEN - tolerated PO diet prior to discharge.
