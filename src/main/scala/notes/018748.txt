[**2182-6-20**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia. Biatrial enlargement. Right axis
deviation. ST segment elevations in leads V3-V4 with tall peaked
precordial T waves and an increase in rate compared to the
previous tracing of [**2182-6-20**].

[**2182-6-20**] CT ABDOMEN: Absence of intravenous contrast limits
evaluation of the abdominal parenchymal organs and vasculature.
There is a small amount of ascites around the liver, and
throughout the abdomen. The liver itself is grossly
unremarkable. Small calcified gallstone is seen within the
gallbladder lumen. There is a mild amount of gallbladder wall
edema, likely secondary to ascites. Pancreas is edematous, and
there is a minimal amount of peripancreatic stranding. There is
no discrete fluid collection or abscess. The spleen is
unremarkable. The adrenal glands, kidneys, and ureters are
unremarkable. Stomach and intra-abdominal loops of bowel are
normal. There is no bowel obstruction. There is no free air or
abnormal intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy.
[**2182-6-20**] CT PELVIS: Pelvic loops of large and small bowel are
normal. Urinary bladder is decompressed with Foley catheter in
place. The uterus and adnexa are grossly unremarkable. There is
a small amount of free pelvic fluid. There is no abnormal pelvic
or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Bilateral femoral central venous
catheters are in place, tips in the external iliac veins. Minor
atherosclerotic changes are seen in the distal abdominal aorta.
There is no osseous lesion suspicious for malignancy. There is
mild
dextroconvex lumbar scoliosis, and associated degenerative
change.
IMPRESSION:
1. No focal lung consolidation. Small right, and trace left
pleural
effusions, and associated mild bibasilar atelectasis.
2. Several small, ill-defined areas of parenchymal nodularity,
largest in the right upper lobe is somewhat linear, 11 mm in
size. Given the background emphysematous change, six-month
followup is recommended to determine stability of these nodules.

3. Mild pancreatic edema and peripancreatic stranding compatible
with
pancreatitis. No peripancreatic fluid collection.
4. Small volume of ascites throughout the abdomen.
5. Cholelithiasis. Mild associated gallbladder wall thickening
is likely
secondary to ascites.

[**2182-6-22**] CTA CHEST W&W/O: There is no evidence of main, central,
or segmental pulmonary embolism. Main pulmonary artery measures
3.6 cm, a finding suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial
hypertension. No significant hilar or mediastinal
lymphadenopathy is identified.
Patient is intubated. Central airways have a posterior
concavity, suggestion tracheomalacia.
Evaluation of the lung parenchyma does reveal increased patchy
areas of
consolidation within the right middle lobe. This is a
nonspecific finding,
but discoid morphology likely reflects atelectasis.
Mold-moderate emphysema is noted. Bilateral moderate pleural
effusions are seen, right greater than left. These are slightly
increased in size since the prior study. Areas of nodularity
again seen, the largest of which is again noted within the right
upper lobe. Six- month followup is again recommended to ensure
stability of these findings.
The visualized portions of the upper abdomen appear grossly
unremarkable,
noting small ascites. No suspicious lytic or blastic bony
lesions are seen.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism. Suggestion of pulmonary
hypertension.
2. Increased pleural effusions.
3. Increased areas of discoid atelectasis in the right middle
lobe.
4. Pulmonary nodules again seen, recommend six-month followup to
ensure
stability.
5. Small ascites.

[**2182-7-8**] Transthoracic Echo:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. No intracardiac shunt is identified after
intravenous saline microbubbles at rest. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure
could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Preserved global
biventricular cavity sizes and global systolic function. No
intracardiac shunt identified.

[**2182-7-15**] Right and left lateral decubitus films:
There is no significant change in the left-sided effusion.
However, the right-sided pleural effusion is slightly decreased
in volume.
There are no other interval changes noted.
IMPRESSION: Stable left-sided pleural effusion with slight
decrease in volume of right-sided pleural effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 64 yo F with HTN, hypothyroidism, obesity, presumed
COPD who presented to an OSH with respiratory failure in setting
of strep pneumo pneumonia and sepsis, and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management.

# Septic Shock: Mrs. [**First Name (STitle) 2523**] was initially hypotensive to the 80s
and with evidence of end-organ damage: elevated LFTs, ARF and
cardiac enzymes.  This resolved with aggressive IVF as well as
temporary treatment with pressors.  She was treated for strep
pneumo pneumonia (sputum cx positive for the organism; bld cx
negative) with a 14 day course of levofloxacin, which was
completed on [**2182-7-3**].

# Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: Mrs. [**First Name (STitle) 2523**] presented
with both hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure in setting
of strep pneu
