Chief Complaint:
ARF

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Renal artery stent

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an elderly female who had
undergone a left nephrectomy at an outside institution. She
had diminished urine output over approximately 48 hours and
was diagnosed on MRA with a high-grade right renal artery
stenosis. She was urgently transferred to our institution.
She was received directly in the cardiac catheterization
holding area and brought urgently into the procedure room.
She was prepped with ChloraPrep and draped in the usual
fashion.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: please reassess pneumonia

Comparison is made with the prior chest x-ray of [**12-8**].
Patchy infiltrates are still present in the right upper lobe,
mildly improved since the prior chest x-ray. Bilateral effusions
are again seen, probably indicating the presence of some
underlying failure as well. The position of the two lines
remains unaltered.

IMPRESSION: Marginal improvement in right upper lobe pneumonia,
some failure persists.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2162-11-30**]

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Dilated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dilated RA. Dilated IVC (>2.5
cm), with
minimal respiratory variation c/w elevated RA pressure of >20
mmHg.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function  (LVEF>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV hypertrophy. Dilated RV cavity.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.


MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Moderate mitral  annular calcification. Mild thickening of
mitral valve chordae. Calcified tips  of papillary muscles. No
MS. Mild (1+) MR. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the  severity of
MR may be significantly UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.
Severe PA
systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is dilated. Left
ventricular wall  thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
are normal (LVEF 60-70%). The  right ventricular free wall is
hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is  dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There  is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to  acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly  UNDERestimated.]
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
is no pericardial effusion.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST

Reason: elevated WBC with persistent right infiltrate, ?
pulmonary a

Diffuse bilateral pulmonary abnormalities are present, including
smoothly thickened septal lines, areas of reticulation, and
multifocal ground-glass opacities. These findings involve
multiple lobes of both lungs but are asymmetrically distributed.
In the left lung, they are most severe in the lingula and in the
right lung, most severe in the right upper lobe. Additionally,
there are multiple areas of patchy consolidation, most
pronounced in the right upper lobe. Within the left lower lobe,
there is a focal area of confluent opacity with associated
volume loss, favoring atelectasis over consolidation. Similarly,
a confluent area of opacity in the right lower lobe, immediately
adjacent to pleural fluid is probably due to focal atelectasis.

Asymmetric soft tissue density in right supraclavicular region
could be due to asymmetrical musculature but is difficult to
distinguish from lymphadenopathy in the absence of intravenous
contrast. Numerous mediastinal lymph nodes are present,
measuring up to 2 cm in diameter in greatest short axis
dimension in the precarinal region. Subcarinal nodes measure up
to 1.3 cm in short axis dimension. Pulmonary hila are difficult
to assess in the setting of enlarged pulmonary arteries and
absence of intravenous contrast, but there is likely at least
mild hilar lymphadenopathy present. The main pulmonary artery is
enlarged at 3.7 cm. The heart is upper limits of normal in size.
Coronary artery calcifications are present.

Small bilateral dependent pleural effusions are present, right
slightly greater than left.

Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, there is diffuse
nonspecific soft tissue stranding within the mesentery. Right
renal artery stent is present. No suspicious abnormalities are
identified within the liver on this unenhanced study. There is a
rounded low attenuation lesion within the spleen measuring about
1.8 cm in diameter, and a second smaller central lesion
measuring about 8 mm in diameter. These are also difficult to
assess in the absence of contrast. Superficial surgical clips
are present in the left posterior upper abdominal wall, and
there is nonspecific soft tissue stranding near the clips.

Comparison CT abdomen [**2162-11-30**] demonstrates a similar
appearance in this region.

The pleural effusions have slightly increased in size
bilaterally since the prior abdominal CT, and the left basilar
opacity has worsened. Right lower lobe is slightly better
aerated posteriorly compared to the prior abdominal CT. With
regard to the splenic lesions, the two lesions appear unchanged
from the recent abdominal CT.

IMPRESSION:

1. Multifocal ground glass opacities and septal thickening, most
likely due to hydrostatic pulmonary edema.

2. Asymmetrical consolidation predominantly involving the right
upper lobe is concerning for infectious pneumonia given the
history of elevated white blood cell count. Asymmetrical edema
is within the differential diagnosis.

3. Small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left,
slightly increased from recent abdominal CT.

4. Bulky mediastinal lymphadenop
