No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2136-11-30**] - Right-sided pleural effusion drainage with pigtail
catheter placement
[**2136-12-3**] - Transesophageal echocardiogram with bedside electrical
cardioversion


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]F with a medical history of atrial
fibrillation not on coumadin, coronary artery disease who is
transferred from [**Hospital3 4107**] after presenting there with
progressively worsening dyspnea. At baseline, she ambulates with
a walker but does not go very far due to leg pain. She had a
recent hospitalization several months ago for "congestive heart
failure" and was started on lasix. She reports increasing
dyspnea for the past several weeks, which she attributes to a
viral infection. With any activity she becomes short of breath.
This has become significantly worse over the past 48hours. She
also endorses new productive cough. She denies orthopnea, PND.
She denies chest, arm, or jaw pain. She denies fever, chills.
She endorses stable left lower extremity swelling. This evening
her daughter called EMS due to her worsening shorntess of
breath. EMS initial vitals were: BP 88/50, O2 sat 90% on 4L
nasal cannula. She was brought to [**Hospital3 4107**].
.
At [**Hospital3 4107**] she was noted to be tachypnic to mid twenties
with oxyhgen saturation of 88% on room air. She was started on
Bipap.  She was noted to be hypotensive w/ systolics in the 80s
so started on levophed. Troponin I <0.06, BNP 375. She was given
levofloxacin for possible pulmonary infection but this
infiltrated. She was given duoneb w/out improvement in
respiratory status. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 96.6 60 94/82 20 100%NRB. On
exam, decreased breath sounds at the right base, A0x3. Labs
notable for WBC of 10 w/ 5% bands, troponin <0.01, lactate of
12.6, BNP of 4116.  ABG on NRB 7.28/21/224. Blood cultures
obtained. CVL placed and CVP 20. CXR showed CVL placement at
atrialcaval junction.  EKG obtained.  She was evaluated by
cardiology, bedside echocardiogram performed that was of limited
quality due to poor echo windows but showed that basal segments
of the heart contract normally, cannot exclude a focal wall
motion abnormality, poor visualization of RV.  Vitals on
transfer: 98/70 on 0.05 levophed, HR in 70s, RR: 20, 100%NRB.
Code status discussed w/ patient (full code).
.
In the ICU, she reports shortness of breath. She is asking to
sit in the chair with legs dependent as this helps with work of
breathing. Feels constipated but denies abdominal pain. Denies
nausea, vomitting, leg pain or weakness.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

IMAGING:
[**2136-11-27**] LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US - Normal hepatic echotexture
with small-volume perihepatic ascites. Thickened gallbladder
wall, which is mildly distended without gallstones or
son[**Name (NI) 493**] [**Name (NI) **] sign. These findings could reflect third
spacing given the concurrent presence of ascites and left
pleural effusion.

Moderate right pleural effusion is stable. Small left pleural
effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation have
increased. The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged. The
pulmonary vasculature is normal and there is no pulmonary edema.
Right jugular line ends in the upper SVC.

embolism. Bilateral moderate-to-large pleural effusions with the
complete passive
collapse of right lower lung and near complete collapse of t
