Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Pulled out G-J tube

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
G-J tube replacement by IR
PICC line replacement


History of Present Illness:
70 yo male with mental retardation, CP, severe vision
impairment, congenital deafness, presents from rehab s/p pulling
out his G-J tube.  Pt is non-verbal, non-communicative, and pt's
brother was unable to be contact[**Name (NI) **] for further information.
History obtained from outside medical records and per ED
history. Pt was admitted to [**Hospital **] Rehab Watham from [**Hospital 1727**]
Medical Center on [**2160-2-26**], after treatment for an MVA in which he
sustained a c6-c7 fracture.  He suffered respiratory failure,
and required tracheostomy, as well as neurogenic bladder for
which he has a suprapubic catheter in place.  Per report from
[**Name (NI) **], pt pulled out his PICC line and his G-J tube; Picc line
was replaced [**5-17**].  It remains unclear exactly when pt's G-J was
noted to be pulled.  He is currently undergoing treatment for
pneumonia growing pseudomonas and beta strep with Ceftazime.  He
also has significant decubitus ulcers, previously noted and
receiving wound care at [**Hospital1 **].
.
Pt admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care while awaiting replacement
G-J tube.
.
Unable to obtain ROS d/t non-communicative.

Past Medical History:
Cerebral palsy
Mental retardation
Legally blind
congenital deafness
Neurogenic bladder; s/p suprapubic catheter placement
hx dCHF
L pulmonary apical nodule; further evaluation deferred
Hx MVA [**10/2159**]; C6-C7 fracture with incomplete cord injury;
resulting LE weakness and neurogenic bladder
G-J tube; presumed d/t aspiration risk

Social History:
Currently residing at [**Hospital **] Rehab. Unable to obtain further
history at this time.

Family History:
Unable to obtain further history at this time. Attempted to
contact pt's brother, but not able to reach.

PM
IMPRESSION: Successful insertion of a new 16 French MIC feeding
tube into
pre-existing tract with tip in the jejunum. The tube is ready
for use.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2160-5-23**] 4:48 PM
Tracheostomy tube appears appropriately positioned. Trace
lucency outlines
the aortic arch and descending aorta which may represent a trace
amount of
pneumomediastinum, to which attention should be paid on followup
examination.
The PICC line is again seen in unchanged position. No
pneumothorax is
appreciated. There is left perihilar haziness and increased
opacity within
the left hemithorax as well as at the right lung base which is
not
significantly changed and may reflect pulmonary edema, although
a superimposed infection cannot be excluded.


Portable TTE (Complete) Done [**2160-5-27**] at 11:20:00 AM
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. There is abnormal systolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure
overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Pulmonary
artery hypertension with right ventricular pressure overload
septal pattern. The normal right ventricular cavity size and
free wall motion suggests that the pulmonary hypertension is
chronic, though cannot exclude acute on chronic process.
