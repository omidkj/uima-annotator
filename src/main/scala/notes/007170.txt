Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 832**]
Chief Complaint:
fever and chills

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central venous line placement


History of Present Illness:
This is an 86 year old male with a history of multiple urethral
strictures secondary to childhood bladder infections with recent
Foley placement presenting with fevers and rigors. Mr [**Known lastname 97883**]
was most recently seen on [**8-10**] by urology for nocturia
and decreased force of urine stream. This was thought to be
secondary to an old residual urethral stricture from TURP for
BPH performed nearly 30 years ago. He has required dilations of
his urethra periodically over the past several decades but had
not had any dilations in the past five years. Cystoscopy in the
urology clinic for evaluation of his nocturia and decreased
urine stream on [**8-12**] revealed an impassable stricture which was
dilated and subsequently a Foley was placed. He was initiated on
finasteride in addition to his usual Hytrin dose. He was
instructed to remove his Foley on [**8-13**] following the procedure
however he failed to deflate the balloon, resulting in
hematuria, with clots, penile pain, and difficulty with
urination. He was seen in the ED for the above; urology was
consulted who replaced a foley with improvement in bleeding - he
was discharged home with Foley in place. He was seen in urology
clinic 1 day prior to admission (on [**8-19**]) when Foley was removed
without incident. On afternoon of admission, patient complained
of fevers and chills with dysuria and blood noted in urine. He
presented to the ED with these complaints. Vitals in the ED
showed Tmax of 103, HR of 110, BP 80/40. Two 18 gauge IVs were
placed and 3 Ls of fluids were given with BP remaining in 80s.
He was started on peripheral norepinephrine for pressor support.
A right-sided IJ was placed. Initial chest x-ray revealed that
central line was too high in position. Urine analysis revealed
pyuria with urine cultures pending. He received vancomycin and
zosyn. He also received an abdominal CT to look for source of
infection. Given his hypotension, he was transferred to the MICU
for observation. In the ICU he was noted to have BPs in the 90s
systolic on norepinehrine, with heart rates in the 60s, and was
afebrile. He had no complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
86yo M with urethral stricture and urinary retention presented
to the ED [**2117-8-20**] with sepsis secondary to UTI, requiring
pressors for 2 days in the MICU. When off pressors and
hemodynamically stable, transferred to general medical floor.
.
# Hypotension: Resolved. Patient recieved a total of 7-8L IVF
during MICU stay. He had been off pressors for over 24 hours
before being transfered to the floor. When he arrived on the
general medicine floor, his pressures were 140s systolic. His
home terasozina and anti-hypertensives were re-started one at a
time as tolerated. His Lasix was not re-inititaed this
admission. Pt did not show any signs of volume overload. Volume
status should be re-evaluated, and Lasix can be re-started at
the discression of PCP.
.
#UTI: Urine growing E. Coli and CoNS. Abx initially narrowed to
vancomycin and ceftriaxone. Sensativities showed E. coli
sensative to TMP/SMX and amoxacillin-clavulonate. CoNS were
sensative to oxacillin and tetracyclines. He was transitioned to
a po regimen of doxycycline and TMP/SMX on day 4 of admission.
Will treat for a total of 14 days for complicated UTI.
.
# Hypoxia ?????? Patient initially presented with new O2 requirement
in setting of sepsis and atelectasis on CXR, now resolved. Pt
encouraged to use incentive spirometry and sit upright, OOB to
chair. Albuterol PRN was needed rarely. Pt saturating well
(mid-90s) on room air at the time of discharge.
.
# Acute renal failure - Resolved after agressive hydration.
Likely [**12-29**] sepsis, prerenal disease, or a combination of these 2
factors given poor PO intake at home. Pt taking good po at the
time of discharge.
.
# Recurrent urethral strictures - Per Urology, keep foley in
place for at least 2 weeks to allow bladder time to heal. Pt
will f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] as outpatient.
.
# Anemia: Baseline Hgb appears to be 12s. Likely [**12-29**]
hematuria/urethral trauma. H/H has been stable throughout
hospital course.
.
# History of bradycardia/primary AV block: Has AICD/pacer in
place. No bradycardia observed during hospital course.
.
# Hyperlipidemia - Home Crestor was restarted on transfer to
medicine floor.
