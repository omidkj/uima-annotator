Chief Complaint:
ERCP, management of a complicated patient

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. ERCP with stent placement
2. Bone marrow biopsy


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 86-year-old man with history of CAD s/p MI, a
fib, AAA, who is transferred from [**Hospital **] hospital for ERCP.
He initially presented to [**Hospital **] hospital on [**7-30**] for
shortness of breath and drop in hematocrit.  The patient notes
that he developed progressive SOB and DOE over the past few
weeks prior to admission, to the point that he would have to
rest after walking 20 feet.  Denies fevers, chills, cough, chest
pain.  Of note, he was seen by an outside dermatologist recently
for chronic urticaria and pruritis, felt to be related to his
anemia.  On admission to [**Location (un) **], he was noted to have a hct
of 19.6 from a baseline of 30.  MCV was 111.  He received a
total of 4 packed red blood cell transfusions with an
appropriate hematocrit bump to 30.  Upper endoscopy and
colonoscopy were performed at the outside hospital showing mild
gastritis, duodenitis, sigmoid-predominant diverticulosis, and
internal hemorrhoids, but no evidence of active or recent
bleeding.  CT abdomen/pelvis yesterday revealed a 1.4cm gall
stone obstructing the distal common bile duct with 1.4 cm
dilation of the common bile duct as well as mild intrahepatic
ductal dilatation, cirrhotic appearing liver with a ~1cm
hypodense lesion, extensive abdominal aortic aneurysm, and
sigmoid diverticulosis.  He was reportedly seen by hematology
with plan for possible bone marrow biopsy as an outpatient.  The
morning of transfer, the patient became hypotensive to the
70-80s systolic.  Reportedly asymptomatic.  His heart rate was
55-65.  He was given a 250cc NS bolus followed by maintenance
fluids and his systolic blood pressure improved to 90.  Blood
and urine cultures were sent and he received one dose of
levofloxacin 250mg IV.  He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.

Images:
[**8-2**] CT abd/pelvis:
1. Findings are consistent with choledocholithiasis and
associated biliary obstruction.  Suggestion of mild intrahepatic
biliary ductal dilatation.  There is dilation of the
extrahepatic portion of the CBD which measures 1.4 cm.  Within
the distal CBD right at the level of the ampulla there is an
obstructing gall stone measuring 1.3 x 1.4 x 1.4 cm.
2. Cirrhotic appearance to the liver with the presence of a
subtle hypodense focus within the left lobe (0.8 x 1.1 x 1.3cm).
The possibility of a neoplastic focus needs to be excluded.
3. Bilateral atrophic kidneys.
4. Extensive abdominal aortic vascular disease involving the
mesenteric vessels, renal arteries, and iliac arteries which are
aneurysmally dilated. Evaluation limited by non-contrast scan.
5. Coronary artery disease.
6. Mitral valve calcifications.
7. Cholelithiasis.
8. Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis.
9. Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.
.
[**7-30**] CXR: There is calcified granuloma in the right lower chest
peripherally unchanged. Minimal atelectasis is seen at the left
lateral sulcus, this may reflect an element of scarring as it is
similar to that seen previously. The left hemidiaphragm is
slightly elevated.  The right lung is otherwise clear.  The
heart is upper normal in size.  There is no CHF.

Echo [**2130-8-8**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated
right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. LV systolic function appears globally depressed
(ejection fraction approximately 30 percent), with regional
variation (the posterior and lateral walls contract better than
the rest of the ventricle). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There
is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic root
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. There is severe mitral annular calcification. At least
moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation is like
