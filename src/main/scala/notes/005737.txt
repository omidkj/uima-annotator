Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2745**]
Chief Complaint:
Back Pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NA

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with past medical history
significant for stable coronary disease, PAF, and a six-month
history of low back pain, left greater than right with radiation
down her left lateral thigh to her left calf.  The pain is
intermittent, sharp, and electric radiating down her left
lateral thigh to her left lateral calf; she has weakness in her
left hip flexor.

She recently had a lumber nerve root block with immediate relief
from the bupivicaine and mild improvement with the steroid
injection.

A week before admission she developed worsening left sciatic
pain, with significant limitation in ambulation. She was brought
in by her daughter for uncontrolled pain and inability to
perform activities of daily living.

She reports pain, denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, loss of urine or stool. There is not a significant
change in the quality of her radiculopathy, rather in the
severity.

 It is worse with sitting and standing for a prolonged time and
worse when getting from a sitting to a
standing position.  She states that the pain is worse when she
lays on her left side as well.  The pain is slightly better with
rest and lying on her right side.  The patient states that she
has been able to walk with only a cane, but over the last six
months, the pain has gotten so bad that at time she needs to
walk
with a walker and this has stopped her from going to church.
She
denies any numbness, any weakness or any bowel or bladder
incontinence.

[**9-11**] TTE:

Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is asymmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral
Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade
III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are focal
calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. There is moderate
thickening of the mitral valve chordae. AT LEAST moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a
restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left atrial
pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: severe asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy;
small left ventricular cavity; severe left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction; at least moderate (and probably significantly more)
mitral regurgitation

[**9-9**] CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast:

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: A left pleural effusion with
associated atelectasis is stable. The lung bases are otherwise
clear. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands, and
kidneys appear unremarkable. Note is again made of a small right
renal hypodensity measuring 6 mm, likely representing a renal
cyst. There is evidence of periportal edema and anasarca.

A large left retroperitoneal hematoma, now measures 8
(transverse) x 7 (AP) x 13 (coronal) cm and allowing for
measurement differences, has not changed in size compared to the
prior study in terms of size. No areas of active extravasation
are noted on the arterial phase imaging and the density of the
retroperitoneal hematoma does not increase with delayed imaging.
No new hemorrhage is identified. The abdominal portions of the
large and small bowel are unremarkable. Heavy calcification of
the abdominal aorta is noted, and a focal area of stenosis at
the level of the pancreas is additionally noted.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Evaluation of the pelvis is
limited
secondary to streak artifact from left hip prosthesis. A Foley
balloon is
present within the bladder. The rectum and sigmoid colon are
grossly
unremarkable.


IMPRESSION: Large left retroperitoneal hematoma essentially
unchanged in size compared to the examination of nine hours
prior. No CT evidence of active extravasation




Brief Hospital Course:
ACUTE ON CHRONIC LUMBOSACRAL RADICULOPATHY: Despite
multimodality pain regimen, the patient's pain remained poorly
controlled, except when treated with ketorolac. Unfortunately,
this is a potentially dangerous medication in this woman with
advanced age, mildly reduced renal function, and on warfarin and
plavix. A pain consult was obtained, but they did not add much
to the present management.

MRI of LS spine showed no evidence of nerve root impingement,
cauda equina or canal stenosis, but incidental note was made of
a possible left pelvic mass. This was further evaluated by
CT....

...It is possible that some of the pain and weakness may be
related to an iliopsoas process.
.
ACUTE RENAL FAILURE: related to NSAID's and dehydration
.
.
PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: Continue warfarin goal INR [**12-31**].
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Stable - plavix, statin, toprol.
OSTEOPOROSIS: Vitamin D, q month Boniva
HYPERTENSION: Continue outpatient medications
