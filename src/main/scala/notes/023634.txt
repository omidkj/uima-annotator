Chief Complaint:
dizziness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

tracheostomy and PEG tube placement
broncheoalveolar lavage
bronchoscopy x 2

History of Present Illness:
63yo man with PMH significant for CAD, HTN, DM, who had
complaints of sinus infection x 5-6 days for which he was
started on mucinex and Zithromax x 1 dose two days prior to
admission, presented as a transfer from an OSH with dizziness
and numbness. He also complained of constant headache on the
right side of his head, not throbbing, without visual changes,
nausea or vomiting. Two nights prior to admission, he went to
void, went back to bed, but was unable to fall asleep because of
the nasal congestion so he went to sit upright in chair.  A
short time later, he got up to go back to bed and became acutely
dizzy (lightheadedness) and had a sense of disequilibrium,
walking like a "drunken sailor." He felt like he would fall
toward the right side. There were no symptoms of vertigo. He
presented to [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital ED and was found to have episodes
of bradycardia, which was felt to be associated with the
episodes of
dizziness. He would have episodes of sudden bradycardic epsidoes
with accompanying jaw pain and lightheadedness, resolving when
the heart rate increased. This was thought to be likely vagal.
An EKG showed nonspecific ST changes. He was admitted to the CCU
at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital. At 8:35PM, the nurse reported that he had
difficulty swallowing and decreased sensation to his right face.
SBP was 180 with full strength in all extremities. An MRI showed
an old frontal defect. At 10:45PM, he was noted to be
questionably dysarthric. At 1:10AM, he complained of persistent
right sided numbness of his face, arm, and leg. He stated that
the "numbness" started at the right side of his head and
progressed downward to the arm, flank, and leg. He says that he
has a pins-and-needles sensation, which has been improved since
its onset. A head CT showed only the old frontal infarct.

ROS was negative for fevers/chills, no SOB, chest pain,
abdominal pain, or dysuria. He did complain of nasal congestion.

Imaging:
BRAIN MRI [**11-19**]: Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of slow
diffusion to indicate acute infarct. There is an area of low
signal visualized within the right side of the medulla and
cervicomedullary junction on susceptibility-weighted images.
This area demonstrates isointense signal to the brain with areas
of hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images. There is also mild
diffuse increased signal seen within the medulla and the upper
cervical spinal cord at this level. There are mild changes of
small vessel disease seen in the periventricular white matter
with chronic lacunes in the left periventricular white matter.
There are no territorial infarcts seen. There is no mass effect,
midline shift, or hydrocephalus.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute infarct. The abnormalities seen
within the right side of the medulla and upper cervical cord has
signal characteristics which is more compatible with a cavernous
malformation with surrounding edema in the cervicomedullary
junction. A focused MRI of the posterior fossa with
gadolinium-enhanced images would help for further assessment.

MRA OF THE HEAD [**11-19**]: Normal MRA of the head.

MRA OF THE NECK [**11-19**]: No significant abnormalities on MRA of the
neck with and without gadolinium.

CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST [**11-22**]: No new areas of intracranial
hemorrhage are identified. There is a tiny focus of increased
density within the left parietal region which likely represents
volume averaging between sulci (series 2, image 24). Ventricles
are symmetric, and there is no shift of normally midline
structures. There has been no interval increase in the caliber
of the ventricles. The basal cisterns are normal in caliber.
There is an area of increased density within the right medulla,
which corresponds to area of abnormality seen on the recent MRI.
The foreman magnum appears patent. There is no definite
supratentorial or cerebellar tonsillar herniation. The soft
tissue and osseous structures are stable in appearance.
IMPRESSION: Again seen is an area of increased density within
the right medulla which corresponds to the cavernous
malformation better evaluated on the recent MRI study. There is
no definite evidence of herniation on this study. No new areas
of intracranial hemorrhage are identified.

Brief Hospital Course:
General: 63yo man who presented to OSH with 2 days of
LH/dysequilibrium and falling to the right, found to have
junctional rhythm that correlated with LH, but was transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] after acute development of right sided paresthesias,
slurred speech, and diff
