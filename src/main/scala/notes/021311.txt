Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
-No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium or left atrial appendage.
-No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
-There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
-Doppler parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate)
left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. with normal free wall
contractility.
-There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
-There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
-The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Pseudonormal diastolic
dysfunction.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified of the results at the time of the
study.

POSTBYPASS:
Preserved LV systolic funciont LVEF > 55%, no swma, no
dissection seen after cannula removed. NO SWMA after chest
closed. Decreased SVR requiring phenylephrine indicated by
normal [**Female First Name (un) **] with reduced ESA in the setting of mildly decreased
BP. No other changes from prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 83836**] was admitted for pre-operative work-up.  Renal was
consulted for hemodialysis recommendations.  She was found to
have a positive urinalysis and was started on Cipro.  The
patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2200-9-26**] where the
he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
Vancomycin was used for peri-operative antibiotics given her
pre-operative inpatient stay of greater than 24 hours.  Overall
the patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively
was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery
and invasive monitoring.
Post-operative day one found the patient extubated, alert and
oriented and breathing comfortably.  The patient was
neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable, weaned from
inotropic and vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated
and the patient was gently diuresed toward her preoperative
weight.  [**Last Name (un) **] was consulted for assistance with post-operative
glucose management.  Coumadin was resumed for pre-operative deep
vein thrombosis.  The patient was transferred to the telemetry
floor for further recovery on post-operative day three.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge
on post-operative day four the patient was ambulating freely,
the wound was healing and pain was controlled with oral
analgesics.  The patient was discharged to home on
post-operative day six.  All appropriate follow-up appointments
were advised.
