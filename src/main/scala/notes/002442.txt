Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4377**]
Chief Complaint:
malaise, fevers

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 68 year-old man with a history of T cell lymphoma
s/p five cycles of CHOP (last dose [**2132-11-28**]) and recently
admitted for pneumonia/sepsis and Capnocytophaga bacteremia
([**2132-11-13**] - [**2132-11-26**], [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] admission) and abdominal pain
([**2132-12-1**] - [**2132-12-3**], no etiology identified) who presents with
malaise and fevers. He was in his USOH after his last discharge
until this morning when he awoke with malaise and fever to 100.7
at home, along with some worsening of his chronic abdominal pain
associated with antibiotic ingestion (levo and clinda for
capnocytophagia bacteremia) and right flank pain. He denied
cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, and loose stools. After
consultation with his oncologist, he presented to the ED.
.
In the ED, vital signs were initially: 99.6 90 115/66 18 90%ra.
He was given vancomycin, levoflox, doxy, and clinda for presumed
infection/recurrence of his capnocytophagia bacteremia and a
chest/abdominal CT demonstrated increased bibasilar
consolidation in the lung bases concerning for progressive
lymphoma vs pneumonia, but no acute findings in the abdomen.
Labs were notable for lactate of 3. He was initially signed out
to BMT but then became hypotensive to SBPs in the 80s. He also
spiked to 101.6. His pressures responded to 4L IVFs and he was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further management. Of note that he
completed courses of levoflox and clinda on [**12-3**].
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
(+) as above. No chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea.


Past Medical History:
1. Melanoma, right arm excised in [**2129**].
2. Question of history of histoplasmosis.
3. Right shoulder surgery for fracture and dislocation [**2129**].
4. Kidney stones 40 years ago.
Oncologic History:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] developed left inguinal swelling in [**5-17**] while in
[**Country 4194**], where it was attributed to a hernia. Upon his return to
the US in early [**Month (only) 216**], his PCP suspected left inguinal
lymphadenopathy and arranged for excisional biopsy of a part of
a lymph node. This revealed reactive changes. He was admitted to
the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2132-9-7**]
with worsening left groin swelling and pain related to worsening
lymphadenopathy, abdominal pain and nausea. Laboratory data
remarkable for elevated LDH and significant eosinophilia (as
high as 30%.) CT imaging demonstrated bilateral basilar
pulmonary nodules and significant lymphadenopathy involving the
retroperitoneal, pelvic, and left iliac chains. Infectious
disease work-up was unremarkable. The CT findings, along with
elevated LDH, raised concern about a lymphoproliferative
disorder. SPEP revealed monoclonal gammopathy, which was
comprised of IgG lambda and constituted 1600 mg/dl. PET scan
demonstrated intensely FDG avid in the left cervical (SUV 18),
right axillary (SUV 5), left supraclavicular (SUV 17), left
paratracheal (SUV 13), retroperitoneal (SUV 22,) and left
inguinal (SUV 25) lymph node groups.
Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] repeat excisional biopsy of an FDG-avid
inguinal lymph node on [**9-13**]. Flow cytometry revealed atypical
lymphohistiocytic infiltrate highly suggestive of peripheral
T-cell lymphoma NOS. On histological examination, the lymph node
architecture was completely effaced with a background of
epithelioid histiocyte granulomatoid aggregates. Intermingled
was an atypical lymphoid population that stained positive for
CD2, 3, and 5 with dual loss of CD4 and CD8 and loss CD7. The
combined morphologic and immunophenotypic picture was most
consistent with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, NOS. [**Last Name (un) **] staining
was negative. IgH gene rearrangement failed to show
monoclonality. TCR rearrangement, on the other hand, was
monoclonal. On further review of BM, he was found to have 5-10%
plasma cells in BM c/w plasma cell dyscrasia.


Social History:
Typically splits his time between [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 82914**] [**Last Name (un) **], [**Country 4194**] and
[**Last Name (un) 51768**]. Spent the majority of the past five years in
[**Country 4194**] where his wife of several years works as a physician. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
frequently traveled to [**Country 4194**] over the past 25 years. Patient
also has a strong social support network of friends in [**Name (NI) 108**].
Patient has traveled to Western Europe; used to smoke a pipe, 5
bowls per day x30 years. Currently living with his son and
[**Name2 (NI) 41859**] in law plus their children here in [**State 350**]. He
used to be an alcoholic but has been sober since [**2098**]. He is a
retired school teacher and used to teach in [**Last Name (un) 51768**],

Pertinent Results:
CT Abd/pelv [**2132-12-7**]:
1. Interval progression of the bibasilar consolidation, with new
involvement of the right middle lobe and lingula. Given the
relative long time course and slowly progressing disease from
foci of centrilobular nodules to frank enlarging consolidation
over several months, the likelihood of an acute infectious
process (in this immuncompromised patient) seems less likely.
Therefore, progression of malignant disease is favored. However,
superimposed infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.
2. No renal calculus or hydroureteronephrosis. No acute
intra-abdominal
process. Interval decrease of inguinal lymphadenopathy.
.
CXR PA and LAT [**2132-12-7**]:
Bilateral basilar opacities, given chronicity question if
possibly indicative of progression of underlying known
malignancy over
infectious process. However, given slight increase in opacities
in
retrocardiac left lower lobe, a coincident pneumonia cannot be
excluded.

CT chest ([**2132-12-9**]): Improved mediastinal lymphadenopathy,
persistent bronchiectasis, small nodules have improved in the
lingula and right middle lobe. Also there has been improvement
in bibasilar consolidation. No areas of acute abnormalities.

1. Marked improvement of bilateral lower lobe opacities.
2. Grossly stable mediastinal lymph nodes with minimal
enlargement of AP
window lymph node, which measures up to 9 mm, previously
measured 7 mm.
3. Probable left renal cyst, stable.
4. Moderate centrilobular emphysema.

CT sinus ([**2132-12-11**]): Minimal sinus disease as described above

TTE ([**2132-12-11**]): Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tampona
