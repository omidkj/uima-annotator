mucosa in the stomach and normal duodenum.  The patient presents
episodes of hematemesis.  Of note, he is on Coumadin for a
history of recurrent deep vein thromboses and pulmonary emboli.

On the day of admission, the patient was at hemodialysis, felt a
chill and then threw up dark blood.  He had one prior episode of
hematemesis a few weeks prior to admission.  On the day of
admission, he vomited approximately three times, one to two
drowsiness and lightheadedness.  He also denied chest pain.

The patient does not take any aspirin and he has no history of
jaundice or liver disease.  However, he does take Advil and
ibuprofen frequently for pain, along with Percocet and Oxycontin.
His last episode of hematemesis was in the Emergency Room.
Attempts to pass a nasogastric tube for lavage were unsuccessful.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical examination on admission was
notable for a temperature of 99.7, maximum temperature 100.6,
heart rate 119 and blood pressure 108/77.  General;  Alert,

Extremities:  Left below the knee amputation, right
transmetatarsal amputation.  Neurologic examination:  Alert,

moving all four extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission potassium was 5.3, BUN 62,
creatinine 5.7, white blood cell count 11.7, hematocrit 38,
prothrombin time 22.2, INR 3.4 and partial thromboplastin
time 60.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted with a low grade
temperature and tachycardia but in no acute distress.  His
coagulopathy was corrected with vitamin K 5 mg and fresh frozen
plasma.  He received an esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2136-12-12**], which revealed evidence of gastritis and duodenitis.

The patient was started on intravenous Protonix and his
hematocrit remained relatively stable in the low 30s.  Two out of
two blood cultures were positive for gram negative rods and he
was given one dose of ciprofloxacin and one dose of ceftazidime.

At that point, he was called out to the general medical service.
He was switched from intravenous to oral Protonix. There were no
beds on the floor that day, therefore, two days later, he was
called out again to the floor.

At this point, the patient had also grown out coagulase negative
Staphylococcus in his blood cultures.  Because of this, he was
given vancomycin in addition to ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin.
His antibiotics were dosed at hemodialysis and he severe access
problems throughout his hospital course.

The patient's left external jugular line and his right Perm-A-
Cath appeared to be infected and his left external jugular line
was removed upon arrival to the floor per infectious disease
recommendations.  He was also being followed by the renal team
and interventional radiology for possible placement of a Perm-A-
Cath.

The patient's right Perm-A-Cath was then removed just after
hemodialysis and he continued to receive antibiotics with
dialysis.  Two days later, when his blood cultures had been
negative for greater than 48 hours, with no lines in place,
interventional radiology placed a new Perm-A-Cath in his left
subclavian.  His last positive blood culture was from [**2136-12-17**], which grew out Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in one out
of two blood culture bottles from the right Port-A-Cath just
before it was removed.

Based on the sensitivities, the patient was switched to Bactrim
in addition to the vancomycin and, since that date, he has been
treated with vancomycin and Bactrim, dosed with hemodialysis.

The patient's course was also complicated by mental status
changes which appeared to be secondary to a combination of his
narcotics and Neurontin, which had been given for his trigeminal
neuralgia and chronic pain.  The Neurontin was stopped and he
received hemodialysis on consecutive days.  His narcotics and
Tegretol were also stopped as they were thought to possibly be
contributing to his mental status change.

The patient had a negative head CT scan and a negative magnetic
resonance imaging scan.  A lumbar puncture was not done because
he was not febrile and there were no meningeal signs, as well as
the fact that his mental status improved with the withdrawal of
those medications and hemodialysis removed the Neurontin.

The patient was evaluated by physical therapy and deemed not
ready to go home.  The plan was to transfer to a short term
rehabilitation facility for continued antibiotics and physical
therapy for eventual transfer to home.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Upper gastrointestinal bleed secondary to gastritis from
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, resolved.
2.  Mental status changes believed secondary to Neurontin and
narcotics, resolved.
3.  Coagulase negative Staphylococcus and Stenotrophomonas
bacteremia.
