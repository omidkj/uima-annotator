HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 58-year-old male
with CHF, CAD, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, COPD,
diabetes with severe autonomic dysfunction originally
admitted on the [**11-29**] with fevers, shortness of
breath, fatigue, and bilateral perfusions.

Patient had been admitted for pneumonia and subsequently
developed sepsis, respiratory failure and was briefly
intubated and started on sepsis protocol.  Patient underwent
thoracentesis with fluid showing transudative effusion in the
ICU.  Patient was completely extubated on hospital day two
with hospital course thus far complicated by AFib.  Initially
started on amiodarone status post cortisone stim test status
post hydrocortisone, coagulopathy secondary to malnutrition.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Had positive tobacco history, quit 25 years
ago, 40 pack year previously, lives with his wife.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Physical exam is significant, in
general significant for cachexia and evidence of
malnourishment.  HEENT showed JVD to half way up the angle of
the jaw and his right IJ [**Location (un) 18296**] catheter in place.
Cardiovascular shows a regular, rate, and rhythm with a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.  Lungs
showed decreased breath sounds at the bases.  Abdominal
examination was nontender and nondistended.  His extremities
show positive fistula in the left upper extremity.  He has a
bandage over the lower extremities.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
1. Cardiovascular:
A. Coronary artery disease:  Patient had been admitted to the
MICU with a mild troponin leak and flat enzymes possibly
thought secondary to CHF and end-stage renal disease.  While
on the floor, he was maintained on aspirin, Plavix, and a low
dose beta blocker.

B. CHF:  Patient with known CHF, ejection fraction of 30-35%.
Patient was generally felt to be in consistent volume
overload, although well compensated.  His volume overload was
believed to be manifested in recurrent pleural effusions.  A
dual strategy approach was taken to manage these pleural
effusions.  1. Patient underwent dialysis several days per
week, and patient underwent several thoracenteses to remove
recurrent effusions.

He remains quite challenging from a ......... standpoint and
CHF standpoint as secondary to his autonomic dysfunction and
difficulty taking fluid off without developing hypotension.
CHF team was consulted during his hospital course for further
evaluation and they recommended low dose beta blocker to
Toprol, low dose ACE inhibitor, and starting on digoxin.  He
was maintained on midodrine pre-hemodialysis and also on
Florinef for severe orthostatic hypotension.
hypotension.

As eluded to above, it was difficult titrating up his ACE
inhibitor and beta blockade secondary to labile and
orthostatic hypotension.

C. Hemodynamics:  As mentioned above, patient with labile
blood pressure secondary to orthostasis, autonomic
dysfunction.  He was maintained on low dose beta blockade and
ACE inhibitor.

D. Rhythm:  During hospital course on the floor, the patient
had several episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular rate.  In between these episodes, patient has
maintained sinus rhythm.  Most recently on [**12-13**], the
patient was started on low dose diltiazem for improved rate
control.  It remains to be seen at this point whether
patient's hemodynamics will tolerate the addition of another
[**Doctor Last Name 360**] that can potentially lower blood pressure.

It was felt by the primary team that patient would not be a
good anticoagulation candidate secondary to his propensity
for falling.  He was maintained on aspirin at this point.
The issue of chemical cardioversion was not addressed at this
point.

2. Pulmonary:
A. Pneumonia/sepsis:  Patient was transferred from the ICU
after respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia.  His
respiratory status improved from this standpoint, and patient
completed a 14 day course of Levaquin.

B. Bilateral pleural effusions:  Patient underwent
re-thoracentesis of recurrent pleural effusions on both left
and right side.  These procedures were in-fact complicated by
pneumothoraces.  Patient remained stable from respiratory
standpoint despite these pneumothoraces.  They were followed
periodically with chest films, and appeared to be stable at
the time of this dictation.

C. COPD:  Patient came in with COPD and being intubated
initially for his pneumonia and respiratory failure.  He
reports a history of being off 5 liters of oxygen.  He was
followed closely during his hospital course to avoid
retaining CO2 secondary to inappropriately high levels of
oxygen.

3. Gastrointestinal:  While on the floor, the patient was
felt to be severely malnourished.  He has a history of severe
gastroparesis and has severe anorexia.  He is currently in
the process of awaiting a G-J tube that should hopefully
improve his nutritional status.

4. Hematology:  Patient's hematocrit remained stable while on
the [**Hospital1 **].  He was not anticoagulated for his episodes of AFib
as he was thought to be a fall risk secondary to his
orthostasis.

5. Infectious disease:  Patient is status post two week
course of Levaquin for pneumonia/sepsis.  These blood
cultures were negative to date during his hospital course.

6. Renal:  Patient has end-stage renal disease now on
hemodialysis.  He has a fistula in his left upper extremity.
He was going to followup closely by the renal team for
management of his CHF/recurrent pleural effusions as
mentioned above.  However, it was challenging taking fluid
off of him in the setting of his orthostasis.

7. Endocrinology:  Patient was maintained on NPH and sliding
scale insulin for his diabetes.  He was also continued on
midodrine for hypertension associated with hemodialysis and
was continued on Florinef also for presumed orthostasis.
orthostasis.

Disposition:  At time of this dictation patient is full code.
He will likely need rehabilitation given his severe
cardiopulmonary disease, his diabetes, and autonomic
dysfunction as well as his knee for dialysis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Community acquired pneumonia/respiratory failure/post
extubation improving.
2. Congestive heart failure/bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Bilateral pneumothoraces.
4. Autonomic dysfunction/orthostasis.
5. End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.
6. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
rate.
7. Malnutrition.

Addendum will be added to this discharge summary as well
medications at that time at patient's discharge.
