.
Mr. [**Known lastname 88052**] is an active man who has been in his usual state of
health with the exception of [**3-13**] weeks of 'difficulty finishing
sentences'. Today he shovelled snow twice. After the second
shovel session he came into the house and in the subsequent [**2-9**]
hours, calked the front door, paid bills and milled about the
house. He went in to the computer room at the back of the house
and was thereafter out of contact with his wife. His wife was
making dinner and went to ask him a question and found him with
his head tilted back on the chair. She called 911. It was 4pm.
.
Fire arrived first and found him to be in a shockable rhytm. He
was shocked twice. EMS arrived an found him to be in PEA, he
received CPR, epi x 3 and atropine x2. Also calcium, dextrose
and bicarb. One IO's was placed in Left tib.  He was intubated.
.
Taken to AJacques. Arrived at 1655 in, where his presentation BP
was 75/55 with HR 66. Two PIV and additional IO in right Tib
placed. He was started on Dopa 10mcg, then 20. His BP rose to
126/69 with HR 120 at 1704. Neo was started with BP at 147/53.
Given 1L of NS, bicarb and had a ROSC. His WBC was 8.3, his HCT
39.8. An ABG at unknown time was 7.12/53.5/132/17. his pressors
were weaned to neo alone. He was transfered to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
At [**Hospital1 18**], he maintained pressures of 130 systolic on neo. Neo
was eventually weaned in the ED. His pupils were fixed
bilaterally. He had an initial trop of 0.07, a WBC of 15.2 and a
lactate of 7.4. EKG with lateral upsloping ST depressions. A CT
of his head found preserved grey-white diff and no ICH. A CT PE
found no PE but did find mediastinal LAD. A right IJ was placed
and he was begun on the arctic sun protocol. He received 1300cc
of IVF and put out 1000 cc by foley. At the time of transfer,
his only infusions were fentanyl and midazolam. his VS were 34.4
112 162/103 26 100% on vent.
.
On review of systems per wife, he denies any prior history of
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough,
hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. he denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Imaging / other studies:
.
CTA chest:
IMPRESSION:
1. Suboptimal evaluation of subsegmental pulmonary arterial
branches due to patient respiratory motion. No evidence of
central pulmonary embolism. No acute aortic dissection.
2. Right hilar lymphadenopathy.
3. Bibasilar opacities consistent with atelectasis or
aspiration.
4. Indeterminate 12 mm left adrenal nodule; further workup with
an MRI or
dedicated adrenal CT is recommended if clinically warranted.
.
Echo:
The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Due
to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. There is mild global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = ~50 %). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. An eccentric, anteriorly
directed jet of moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
EEG:
IMPRESSION: This EEG done continuously over 24 hours shows a
severe
encephalopathy manifest by marked suppression with intermittent
bursting
pattern compatible with the cooling protocol itself and sedative

medication. No significant seizure discharges were identified.
.
EKG on admission: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response. Increased QRS voltage but does not meet criteria for
left ventricular hypertrophy in precordial leads. ST-T wave
abnormalities. No previous tracing available for comparison.
.
EKG during admission: Atrial fi
