Chief Complaint:
s/p MVC with acute liver failure and acute renal failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NG tube placement

History of Present Illness:
42 y/o woman with history of bipolar disorder, Substance abuse,
Hep C, COPD and DVT on coumadin who initially presented to [**Hospital **] after an MVC. Patient was notably somnolent
during trauma work up and labs were drawn showing an ALT of
11,0000, AST 9000, creatinine 3.0, hct 44, INR>15 and Tylenol
level of 15. Pt was given NAC (inappropriately dosed) and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further management.
.
On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], initial VS were: T 97.7 BP 112/72 HR 126 RR
14 Sats 95% on RA. Liver was consulted and recommended CT and
RUQ u/s (no dopplers) which were unrevealing. Pt was given the
NAC with initial bolus and started on continuous gtt. She
remained somnolent but arousable to vigorous stimulation. NG
tube was placed with some coffee grounds returned and pt was
given lactulose 30 mL.
.
On arrival to the MICU, pt was sleepy and not responding to
questions. However, upon arrival of her family, she became more
alert, tearful and was able to answer some questions. She
reported headache, abd pain, mild shortness of breath and denied
any SI or overdose attempt.

EKG [**2156-6-14**]: Sinus tachycardia. Low inferior and precordial lead
T wave amplitude is non-specific and may be within normal
limits. No previous tracing available for comparison.
.
Imaging:
.
RUQ ultrasound [**2156-6-13**]: No biliary obstruction, focal liver
lesion or portal venous thrombosis.
.
CT abdomen/pelvis [**2156-6-13**]:
1. No focal liver lesions or evidence of cirrhosis on this
non-contrast
study.
2. Hepatic hypoattenuation compatible with steatosis or edema.
3. Status post cholecystectomy.
.
RUQ ultrasound with Doppler [**2156-6-13**]:
1. Normal Doppler arterial and venous evaluation of the liver.
2. Normal kidneys, no hydronephrosis.
.
Bilateral lower extremity ultrasound [**2156-6-13**]:
1. Left common femoral and superficial femoral partially
occlusive DVT and
completely occlusive left popliteal venous DVT.
2. No DVT in the right lower extremity.
.
PICC placement [**2156-6-17**]: Uncomplicated ultrasound and
fluoroscopically-guided double-lumen PICC line placement; the
internal length is 35.5 cm with its tip at cavoatrial junction;
the line is ready to use.
.
Endoscopy:
.
Colonoscopy [**2156-6-25**]:
Stool in the colon
Polyp in the sigmoid colon
Polyp at 1cm in the colon
Grade 1 internal hemorrhoids
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum
Recommendations: Stool in colon. Poor prep. Unable to fully
visualize mucosa. Penduculated and sessile polyp. Pedunculated
polyp could be potential source of bleeding. No polypectomy
performed given patient on coumadin and heparin. Patient will
need repeat full colonoscopy and polypectomy once completed
course of anticoagulation.
.
EGD [**2156-6-25**]:
Erythema in the fundus compatible with mild gastritis
Otherwise normal EGD to third part of the duodenum

Brief Hospital Course:
42 y/o F with history of bipolar disorder, COPD, substance abuse
and recent MVC transferred with mental status changes and acute
liver and kidney failure in the setting of an overdose.
.
# Acute liver failure: The etiology of the patient liver failure
was likely toxin mediated (given ingestion of >30 grams of
Tylenol). There also may have been a component of ischemic
injury. The patient was treated with NAC and supportive care.
Her transaminases were ALT 11,0000, AST 9000 prior to transfer
and trended downward throughout her hospital course, with ALT 43
and AST 15 at the time of discharge. Tbili was never greater
than 1.5.
.
# Coagulopathy/anticoagulation/DVT: The patient has a left lower
extremity DVT. Her INR was elevated to 15 on presentation. This
was thought to be due to acute liver injury. It was unclear if
there was also a Coumadin overdose. The patient was treated with
vitamin K, with resolution of her coagulopathy. Warfarin was
restarted on [**2156-6-16**], at which time the patient's INR was 1.1. At
the time of discharge, the patient's INR was 1.4. Her goal INR
is 2.0 to 3.0. The patient was discharged on Coumadin 5 mg
daily. She will get her INR checked at her PCP's office on
[**2156-6-28**] and [**2156-6-30**]. The patient will self-administer Lovenox 80
mg daily for 5 days in order to provide a therapeutic bridge.
.
# Acute kidney injury: The patient developed acute kidney
injury, with creatinine peaking at 9.1 on [**2156-6-17**]. The patient
did not require hemodialysis. Her urine output eventually
increased, and her creatinine fe
