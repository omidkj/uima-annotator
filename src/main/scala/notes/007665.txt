Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Aspirin / Percocet / Codeine / Nutren Pulmonary

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2387**]
Chief Complaint:
Urosepsis and pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement [**2169-11-2**]


History of Present Illness:
85F from [**Hospital1 **] with reports of R facial droop and slurred
speech. Began vs. noticed at 9:30a. At the NH, she was
hypotensive with a BP of 60/40, which improved to 80/60 with
500ml NS. In the ED, code stroke called but head CT showed no
bleed. Neurology was consulted and felt that she did not suffer
a large stroke and as such, no TPA was indicated. Was on a
course of levofloxacin at [**Hospital1 **] for UTI. In the ED, she
received vanco, ceftaz, steroids, 1 unit PRBCs, and tylenol for
hypotension and presumed sepsis.
.
She was admitted to ICU for sepsis secondary to PNA and UTI.
Given her h/o multidrug resistant pseudomonas UTIs, she was
started on meropenem with clinical improvement.  Urine cultures
from day of admission, however, revealed pseudomonas was
resistant to meropenem.  Given her clinical improvement,
concentration of meropenem in the urine might be adequate to
treat so she has been continued on it.  The lab is currently
performing additional antibiotic sensitivities.  Additionally,
cultures from a recent bronchial washing revealed MRSA and,
given pneumonia on imaging and clinically with associated
sepsis, she has been continued on vancomycin since admission.
.
She is being transferred to the care of her primary cardiologist
for further management of the above issues while hospitalized.
.
ROS: denies fevers, chills, shortness of breath, dysuria,
frequency, hematuria, hematochezia, chest pain, admits to
shortness of breath, but says is baseline, admits to fatigue and
weakness. Complains of pain on right thigh secondary to zoster.


Past Medical History:
1)Asthma > 5 hospitalization with no history of intubations. She
has been on steroids since the beginning of [**Month (only) 216**]. Prior to
this, she had been steroid free for the past 2 years. Recent
hospitalization with intubation complicated by MRSA pneumonia,
d/c on [**9-25**] to rehab.
2)Hypertension.
3)Steroid induced hyperglycemia. Discharged on insulin following

her [**Hospital1 **] admission.
4)Peripheral vascular disease, status post left fem-peroneal
bypass in [**2162**]
5)Multi-focal bacterial pneumonia.
6)Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease- PFT [**7-2**]- FVC 61% pred,

FEV1 56% pred, FEV1/FVC 92%, Reduced FVC related to gas
trapping, ~400 cc worse than PFT from one year ago.
7)Multi-focal atrial tachycardia.
8)Oral thrush.
9)Question left hilar mass.
10)Mult aspirations in past requiring now being on feeding tube

11)Hx. MRSA PNA
12) Bell's Palsy
13) UTI
14) GIB


Social History:
Denies history of smoking. Only social alcohol, ~3 drinks /week.
No other drug use. Widowed, with 3 children and 8 grandchildren.



Family History:
Asthma in her father

Physical Exam:
T 97.1 HR 89 BP 131/66 O2 sat 99% on 2L NC Weight 61 kg
Gen: pleasant cooperative NAD
HEENT: very dry MM, PERRL
Cor: tachycardic, irregularly irregular, II/VI systolic murmur
heard loudest at the apex and radiating to L axilla
Pulm: tachypneic, diffuse rhonchi, egophany in the RLL field
Abd: +BS, soft/NT/ND, JPEG in place
Ext: 2+ doughy edema B/L LE, dressing in place over stasis
ulcers on B/L LE (L appears superficial, 1cm; R shows some
muscle, but appears to be healing well), strength lower
extremities [**1-29**] bilaterally, upper extremities [**3-1**] bilaterally.
Skin: fragile skin, chronic venous stasis changes, scattered
ecchymoses, xerotic
Neuro: thinks she was recently in [**State 108**]. Ptosis of right eye,
mild right facial droop. Sensation intact. No tongue deviation.

Pertinent Results:
[**2169-10-29**] Portable CXR: Persistent left lower lobe opacity and
effusion. 2.Similar rounded right infrahilar density, previously
felt to represent rounded atelectasis. 3. New right lower lobe
opacity which may represent recurrence of atelectasis or
pneumonia.
.
[**2169-10-29**] Head CT: 1.  No hemorrhage.  Chronic microvascular
ischemic changes. 2.  Sinus disease as noted above.
.
EKG: ectopic rhythm with right axis and right bundle branch
block
.
[**2169-10-30**] CHEST CT: IMPRESSION:
1. Limited assessment for hilar mass due to absence of
intravenous contrast. If the patient has strict
contraindications to iodinated contrast, MRI of the chest should
be considered to answer the clinical question of hilar mass.
2. Confluent rounded opacity in right infrahilar region which
has developed since [**2169-9-15**] and probably represents a
combination of round atelectasis and reactive lymph nodes, but
is not fully characterized on this unenhanced CT scan.
3. Persistent lower lobe bronchial impaction and combination of
atelectasis and consolidation, in keeping with the provided
history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia. New multifocal
centrilobular nodular opacities likely reflect a diffuse
bronchiolitis, either from aspiration or infectious etiology.
4. New small amount of ascites, development of anasarca, and
slight increase in small bilateral pleural effusions.
5. Diffuse mesenteric stranding throughout the imaged portion of
the upper abdomen, a nonspecific finding. If the patient
undergoes a contrast enhanced CT of the chest or MRI, inclusion
of the abdomen may be considered to more completely evaluate
these structures if warranted clinically.
6. Diffuse coronary artery calcifications.
.
[**2169-9-15**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is normal in size. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal.  Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Right  ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is  mildly dilated. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is  mild
aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**11-28**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests
impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is a very small pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2169-8-22**],
right ventricle is now smaller and more vigorous.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 85 woman with PNA and UTI, leading to severe sepsis.
.
# Sepsis:  Likely secondary to urinary tract infection and
pneumonia. In the past, has grown out resistant pseudomonas from
urine.  Meropenem was started, renally dosed to cover
pseudomonas and anaerobes.  Sensitivity data demonstrated
pan-resistant pseudomonas in the urine, however, in discussion
with infectious disease, in [**Last Name (un) 5153**] sensitivities may not
appropriately reflect in [**Last Name (un) **] sensitivities and meropenem is
concentrated in the urine so may indeed adequately treat her
pseudomonal infection.  Given her clinical improvement on
meropenem, she was continued during her stay and will be
discharged to rehab to complete a full 14 day course.  Her blood
pressures stabilized and did not require pressors, she was in
addition maintained on Vancomycin renally dosed, as she recently
had the history of MRSA pneumonia in [**2169-9-15**].  She is to finish
a 14 day course of vancomycin and meropenem to be completed on
[**2169-11-12**].
.
# CHF: Likely diastolic dysfunction (impaired relaxation on
recent echo)given preserved EF. Admission BNP was [**Numeric Identifier 96594**] up from
[**Numeric Identifier **] on [**9-27**]. She initially had bilateral pleural
effusions, LE edema, and ascites/anasarca seen on CT, but
patient is currently maintaining O2 saturations in the mid 90s
on RA. Once her pressures stabilized, she was actively diuresed
with 40mg Lasix IV BID with good effect.  She did transiently
have increased oxygen requirement with oxygen saturations in the
mid 80s on room air which required 4L O2 by NC to maintain O2
