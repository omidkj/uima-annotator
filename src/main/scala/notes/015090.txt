Date of Birth:   [**2078-9-21**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CARDIOTHORACIC

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year-old man
with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who
presents to an outside hospital with complaints of chest pain
and shortness of breath.  He has had intermittent chest pain
for one week accompanied with acute worsening dyspnea this
morning.  In the Emergency Department he was hypertensive,
hypoxemic and with an examination consistent with congestive
heart failure.  He had an increased amount of chest pain and
was transferred to the [**Hospital1 69**].
An electrocardiogram at the [**Hospital1 188**] revealed ST depressions in V1 to V3. No ST elevations
and he was taken to the catheterization laboratory, which
revealed a left circumflex artery occlusion, which was
stented open fluoroscopically.  In addition, the
catheterization revealed three vessel disease with 90% mid
vessel occlusions, stenosis of the left anterior descending
artery, 70% stenosis of the diagonal branches the left
anterior descending coronary artery and 80 to 90% stenoses of
the right coronary artery.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lipitor.
2.  Atenolol.
3.  Nitropaste.

At the outside hospital he received intravenous heparin,
Bumex, magnesium, nitroglycerin drip.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Because of his three vessel disease the
patient was evaluated for a coronary artery bypass graft and
underwent a preoperative evaluation for a coronary artery
bypass graft over the next few days.  He had an
echocardiogram that showed a 45 to 50% ejection fraction with
no significant valvular anomalies.  Carotid ultrasound
revealed a left stenosis less then 40% and minimal disease on
the right side.  After these tests were performed and he was
consented for the procedure he was brought to the Operating
Room on [**2139-12-21**] where he underwent a coronary artery bypass
graft times there.  The left internal mammary coronary artery
was anastomosed to the left anterior descending coronary
artery and saphenous vein grafts were connected, the
ascending aorta to the posterior descending artery and the
diagonal branch.  He was on cardiopulmonary bypass for 80
minutes and the aorta was cross clamped for 66 minutes.  He
was transferred to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit on
Propofol and insulin drips and later that evening he was
actually extubated without complications.  On postoperative
day one the patient was doing very well and was transferred
to the floor.  On postoperative day two his Foley, pacer
wires and chest tubes were discontinued.  The rest of his
stay revolved around physical therapy and hypertensive
management, which was eventually controlled with increasing
levels of Captopril and Metoprolol.

On postoperative day three, however, the patient began to
complain of increasing chest pain.  An electrocardiogram was
performed, which showed inferior and lateral ST elevations.
The patient underwent an echocardiogram, which showed a 40%
ejection fraction, which was decreased from the preop value
and the patient was brought to the catheterization laboratory
emergently that evening.  The angiography performed in the
catheterization laboratory showed patent surgical grafts,
however, the left circumflex artery was occluded proximal to
the previously placed stent.  This occlusion was opened and a
stent was put in place.  He was transferred back to the floor
on a nitroglycerin intravenous drip and did well following
this procedure.  On postoperative day four the nitroglycerin
drip was discontinued and the patient was transfused for a
low hematocrit.  The patient was restarted on his physical
therapy other medications.  The patient was discharged on
postoperative day six [**2139-12-27**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Unstable angina.
3.  Hypercholesterolemia.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
6.  Two coronary angiographies and left circumflex artery
stenting and he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft
procedure.

FOLLOW UP:  Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] in one month and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] his primary care physician in one week.
