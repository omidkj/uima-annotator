Chief Complaint:
Left leg pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 53 year old female with history of PVD requiring bypass
procedures in both lower extremities, diabetes, and renal
failure on HD who presented with three days of pain on her lower
left leg. At rest and with no pressure, the pain was described
as "achy" [**3-8**]. However, with any pressure or movement, the pain
was described as sharp and [**9-7**]. She said it started at a level
just below her knee and radiated to the foot. Overall the pain
was worsening, and on the day of admission she could not walk.
Pain was constant and not alleviated by anything she did,
including taking "pain pills" she had from her recent procedure.
The pain interfered with falling asleep and also woke her at
night. Pt noted that her left leg swelled on the first day of
the pain. Pt recalled no recent trauma, bug bites, fevers,
chills, vomiting, nausea, or difficulty breathing. Of note, her
son was killed while at a friend's house on the first day that
she experienced the leg pain. She states the pain began before
that occurred. She notes that her appetite and sleep have been
poor. Since her bypass in [**Month (only) 116**], she has lived in a rehabilitation
facility.
.
In the last month, pt noted mood swings and a loss of memory.
She stated being forgetful of both recent and remote memories.
She mentioned it may be secondary to her medications.

Final Report

RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:
   22.3 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m MDP ([**2191-7-8**]);
HISTORY: Left lower extremity pain and leukocytosis with concern
for possible
infection.

INTERPRETATION:
Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and
posterior
projections.  Coned down flow and static images of both distal
lower extremities
were also obtained.  This study is somewhat limited by large
patient body
habitus.  There is no focal abnormal uptake of the left lower
extremity to
suggest infection. Increase uptake of the right ankle is likely
due to
degenerative stress changes.  The kidneys and urinary bladder
are visualized,
the normal route of tracer excretion.
IMPRESSION:
No abnormal uptake of the left lower extremity to suggest
infection.


CXR [**2191-7-6**]:  INDICATION:  End-stage renal disease with fever.
COMPARISON:  [**2191-5-7**] and [**2191-5-14**].
PORTABLE SUPINE VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Heart size at the upper
limits of normal.
There is right lateral and left lateral plate-like atelectasis.
There is
streaky left retrocardiac opacity.  No overt pulmonary edema.
There is no
pneumothorax.  The right costophrenic angle is not imaged.  Left
costophrenic
angle is sharp.
IMPRESSION:
1.  Bilateral plate-like areas of atelectasis in the lateral mid
lungs.
2.  Streaky left retrocardiac opacity, favor atelectasis over
pneumonia.

LLEG XRAY [**2191-7-6**]:
HISTORY: 53 y/o woman with peripheral vascular disease and
requiring bypass of bilateral lower extremities. Patient with
right wound infection. Evaluate for osteomyelitis or fracture.

FINDINGS: There are no signs for acute fractures or
dislocations. There is
overall demineralization. Extensive vascular calcifications are
present. There is some flattening of the calcaneus posteriorly
without discrete fracture line. Vascular calcifications are seen
throughout the medial aspect of the lower extremity soft
tissues. The ankle mortise is preserved. There is no abnormal
soft tissue gas.

IMPRESSION:
No radiographic evidence for osteomyelitis or acute fracture.

R Calf U/S [**2191-7-5**]: CLINICAL INDICATION:  Right calf abnormality
on MRI; varicosities vs. abscess.

COMPARISONS:  Calf MR dated [**2191-7-3**].

FINDINGS:  Multiple [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-scale and color Doppler images were
obtained in the
region of MR abnormality in the anteromedial calf subcutaneous
tissues. Images
revealing 1.4 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm complex cystic lesion without
definite flow
within or around it.  The lesion contains floating echogenic
debris but no
solid nodular component.

IMPRESSIONS:
1.  1.4-cm subcutaneous complex cystic lesion, likely
representing a sebaceous
cyst.  A small abscess would be considered less likely given the
absence of
associated vascularity.  This appearance is not consistent with
a varicosity.

[**2191-7-3**] U/S Venous doppler to eval for DVT:
INDICATION:  53-year-old female with three-day history of leg
pain and
swelling.  Please evaluate for popliteal DVT.

FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to duplex ultrasound from [**2191-7-2**],
which
completely assessed the left common femoral and superficial
veins, but did not
assess the popliteal vein secondary to patient discomfort.

FINDINGS:  Grayscale, color and pulse wave Doppler son[**Name (NI) 1417**]
were performed on the bilateral popliteal veins.  Normal flow,
compressibility, waveforms, and augmentation are demonstrated.
Augmentation in the left popliteal fossa could not be
demonstrated secondary to patient discomfort.  No intraluminal
thrombus is identified.

IMPRESSION:  No evidence of DVT in the bilateral popliteal
veins.
