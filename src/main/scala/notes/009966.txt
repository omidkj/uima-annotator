History of Present Illness:
(From General Admission Note)
67 y/o M h/o CAD, COPD, GERD, and diverticulosis a/w painless
BRBPR. He was well until a recent hospitalization [**Date range (1) 19032**] for
COPD exacerbation and UTI treated with a prednisone taper and
broad-spectrum antibiotics (given his history of resistant
pathogens), respectively. The morning of admission, he awoke at
4 AM to have a bowel movement and felt a painless gush of bright
red blood after the passage of formed stool. He had 4 such bowel
movements. He denies ever seeing bleeding like this before. He
endorses a 20 lb. unintentional weight loss over the past year.
He denies fever, chills, dizziness, lightheadedness, chest pain,
change in his baseline cough/sputum production/dyspnea,
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, [**Date range (1) **], sick contacts, or
recent travel. A  colonoscopy in [**11-12**] to workup GIB and weight
loss showed diverticulosis of the whole [**Date Range 499**] and Grade 1
internal hemorrhoids.
.
In the ED, initial V/S: T 98.3 HR 57 BP 115/71 RR 22 O2sat 93%
RA. BRB on rectal exam, no external hemorrhoids noted. WBC 17.9
Hct 33.2% plts 486K. Ninety minutes into his ED course his
automated BP was found to be 74/40, then 99/50 manually - the
patient was asymptomatic. He was given 2 L NS. After quickly
drinking a cup of water, he experienced midline abdominal pain
which resolved after being made NPO. He is currently
asymptomatic.
.
On the floor the patient had a couple of episodes of hypotension
to the 80s which was responsive to IVF.  His Hct dropped from 33
to 23.  He had an NG lavage that was negative.  GI was consulted
and is planning on a c-scope in the am unless patient needs
tagged red cell scan.

Imaging: [**2107-3-1**] CXR

PORTABLE CHEST UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH: Comparison is made to
[**2107-2-16**] CT and radiograph. Exam is not significantly
changed from most with persistent bibasilar bronchiectasis and
more linear left lower lobe atelectasis with more medial right
lower lobe consolidative opacity. Cardiomediastinal silhouette
and hilar contours are within normal limits and unchanged in
appearance. The underlying emphysema is again noted.

IMPRESSION:

No significant interval change from most recent exam with
persistent bibasilar opacities.

.

[**2107-2-16**] CTA ABDOMEN

No focal hepatic lesion is identified. The gallbladder, spleen,


pancreas and adrenal glands appear normal. The kidneys enhance
symmetrically and excrete contrast normally without evidence of
hydronephrosis or hydroureter. A left renal cystic lesion is
unchanged. Intra-abdominal loops of large and small bowel are of
normal caliber. There is extensive colonic diverticulosis,
without evidence for acute diverticulitis. There is no
pneumoperitoneum or free fluid. Scattered mesenteric and
retroperitoneal lymph nodes are identified, none of which meet
CT criteria for pathologic enlargement. Atherosclerotic
calcifications involve the abdominal aorta though there is no
evidence for dissection. Minimal ectasis of the infrarenal
thoracic aortic measures 2.1 x 2.0 cm.

Bone windows reveal no worrisome lytic or sclerotic lesions.
Multilevel mild thoracolumbar degenerative changes are observed.


IMPRESSION:

1. Minimal ectasia of infrarenal aorta noted.

2. Extensive colonic diverticulosis without evidence for acute
diverticulitis.

[**3-2**] Colonoscopy:

Brief Hospital Course:
67 y/o M h/o CAD, O2-dependent COPD, GERD, and diverticulosis
a/w painless BRBPR, completed [**Month/Year (2) 499**] prep.

#GI bleed - Per pt's report, he had had multiple large BM
completely of bright red blood. Since admission, there was no
more [**Month/Year (2) **] bleeding, but one black stool, and persistent guaiac
positive stools. Pt had a negative NG lavage. Hct initially
dropped from 33 to 23, but bumped appropriately to 2U of pRBCs
and remained stable after that. Pt was prepped and scoped, which
showed extensive diverticulosis but no active bleeding source.
Pt was monitored transiently in the ICU, with frequent Hcts and
active type and screen. He did not require any furthur
transfusions. Surgery and IR were consultured for furthur
treatment if pt rebleeds and for furthur prophylactic surgical
options.  Aspirin and BP meds were held and restarted prior to
discharge (except CCB as pt was persistently asymptomatically
hypotensive, at his baseline per pt).

#Leukocytosis ?????? WBC fluctuated but pt remained clinically
stable, afebrile and without localizing signs of infection. CXR
was negative, UA negative, cultures negative. He remained on his
stable dose of PO steroid and fluctuation was thought to be due
to stress response of bleeding and scoping.

#HTN - Pt's BP meds were held while hypotensive and ACEi
restarted prior to discharge. Verapamil was continued to be held
at discharge until reevaluation by PCP.

#COPD: Pt satted well on home O2, prednisone and inhaler
regimen.

#Glaucoma: Continued outpt eye gtts
