Brief Hospital Course:
73yo M w/ long hx of CLL on chronic steroids and c/b AIHA,
hypogammaglobinemia, recent R hip fx ([**1-6**]) s/p  R hip nail and
ORIF and recurrent pna's, returns with presents with PNA (cough,
tachycardia, hypoxia) and after treatment with antibiotics and
therapeutic thoracentesis without improvement, family discussion
reached conclusion of making pt [**Name (NI) 3225**].

#. [**Name (NI) 103760**] Pt was brought to the ICU w/ his tachypnea, and
placed on bipap. Once he reached the ICU pt was taken off the
bipap and was found the was 97-100% on RA. His RR was still in
the 40-50s. This was attributed to his pleural effusions. He
also has a h/o Recurrent pleural effusions, status post right
pleurodesis on [**2131-10-1**]. A left thoracentesis was performed w/
1100cc of bloody fluid removed, sent for cytology, cell count
and diff, hct, and was c/w malignant effusion. Pt had tachypnea
that improved post-thoracentesis w/ RR in 20s increasing to 30s
the following day. Central hyperventilation was considered from
a CNS infection but thought low likelihood and LP was not
pursued after discussion w/ Hem/Onc. CXR on [**2-23**] showed
significant reaccumulation of the fluid. Pleurodesis was
discussed, but w/ such rapid reaccumilation and pt being near
end of life, decision was made to focus on comfort and pt was
made [**Month/Year (2) 3225**]. He was transferred out of the ICU, where he became
lethargic and minimally aroused. Nasal cannulla supplementary
oxygen was continued for comfort breathing, and morphine ordered
for liberal use if breathing appeared labored or pt in pain.
Vital signs checks were discontinued. Pt passed away on [**2-24**]
from cardiopulmonary arrest, with family by the bedside.

#. Fever - pt has had chronic cough since [**Month (only) **], and reccurent
PNA. No focal infiltrate on CT. Pt may have pnau Pt may be
immunocompromised from CLL and will tx. Pt received Vanc/Zosn in
ED. Pt may have develo
