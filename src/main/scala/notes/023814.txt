[**2109-4-22**] Echo: PRE BYPASS The left atrium is markedly dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%).
The fright ventricle is only very poorly seen. The mid free wall
of the right ventricle appears to function well. The ascending
aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple atheroma in the aortic
arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There
is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There
is severe mitral annular calcification. There is [**Month/Day/Year 1192**]
valvular mitral stenosis (area 1.5cm2). The mitral regurgitation
vena contracta is >=0.7cm. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
notified in person of the results in the operating room at the
time of the study. POST BYPASS: The right ventricle is poorly
seen but the mid portion of the free wall appears to function
normally. The left ventricle displays normal systolic function.
There is a bioprosthesis in the mitral position that appears
well seated. The leaflets appear to function normally. There is
no obvious mitral regurgitation seen. The maximum gradient
across the mitral valve prosthesis is about 11 mm Hg with a mean
gradient of 4 mm Hg at a cardiac output of about 4.2 liters per
minute. The thoracic aorta appears intact.
[**4-23**] Head CT: Normal CTA of the head with no evidence of
infarction on CT.
[**4-24**] Carotid U/S: Scattered calcific plaque involving both
carotid systems, no significant ICA or CCA stenosis, however.

Final Report
TWO VIEW CHEST, [**2109-4-26**].
COMPARISON: [**2109-4-25**].
INDICATION: Status post coronary artery bypass surgery.
Stable postoperative widening of the cardiomediastinal contours.
No
substantial pneumothorax.
FINDINGS: Improving bibasilar atelectasis and small bilateral
pleural
effusions. Retrosternal gas in the lateral projection may be a
normal
postoperative finding, but correlation with clinical findings is
suggested to exclude the possibility of mediastinal infection.
Dilated loops of gas-filled bowel in upper abdomen are
incompletely evaluated on this chest radiograph exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit after undergoing pre-op
work-up prior to admission. On [**4-22**] he was brought to the
operating room where he underwent a coronary artery bypass graft
x 3 and mitral valve replacement. His bypass time was 150
minutes with a crossclamp time of 129 minutes. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. On post-op day one he was
noted to have word finding difficulties and neurology was
consulted and he was brought for a head CT. Was ruled out for a
stroke but neurology felt it was possibly TIA do to
hypoperfusion. His symptoms of word finding difficulties
eventually resolved. He remained in the CVICU for another day
for observation and on post-op day two he was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further care. He was started on Bblockers
and diuretics, his chest tubes and epicardial pacing wires were
removed per protocol. Over the next several days his activity
level was advanced with the assistance of nursing and physical
therapy. He was noted to have post-op atrial fibrillation that
was treated with Amiodarone and Bblockers and subsequently
converted to sinus rhythm. The remainder of his post operative
course as uneventful. On POD 7 he was discharged home with
visiting nurses. He is to return to wound clinic in 2 weeks and
to see Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 4 weeks.
