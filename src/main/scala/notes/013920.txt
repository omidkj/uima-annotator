Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 905**]
Chief Complaint:
Status post fall.
Reason for MICU admission: tachycardia, falling hematocrit.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Left femur intramedullary nail.


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of hypertension, asthma, CVA in
[**2140**] on anticoagulation, MRSA left hip infection in [**2142**] (on
life long doxycycline), transferred status post fall in commode
at OSH on [**2144-9-19**], while being treated for a UTI.  At the OSH,
patient found to have a right humeral and left distal femur
fracture.  There was no venous insufficiency, distally.
Preliminary reads at the OSH revealed no abnormalities on head
CT or cervical spine.  Patient's abdomen/pelvis were reported as
normal.
.
On presentation, found to have HR 120 BP 120's and O2 sat 100%
on 2L.  EKG revealed sinus tachycardia.  Pain was controlled
with morphine and tachycardia treated with metoprolol.
Ceftriaxone was continued for patient's UTI.  Shortly after
admission to orthopedics service, for impending surgery,
patient's hematocrit decreased from 31 to 25.6 in 6 hours.  Ct
was negative for hip bleed.  Right groin line was placed.  As
patient's blood pressure decreased to the 70's, responding to 2
liters IVF to the 90's, and O2 saturations that were in the
80's, but only returned to [**Location 213**] with 10L supplemental oxygen,
she was transferred to the medical ICU.  She spiked a fever to
100.0F, so vancomycin 1gm given for presumed line infection.
Her blood pressure remained tenuous, so she received a total of
4 units of packed red blood cells and 2 units of fresh frozen
plasma during these first several days.
While in the MICU, patient was noted to have NSTEMI, with
cardiac ECHO noted to reveal new global hypokinesis.  Troponins
elevated to 1.28, but subsequently trended downwards.  Following
surgery, she was noted to develop new-onset atrial fibrillation,
but she remained hemodynamically stable.  Patient was started on
metoprolol and lovenox and transferred to medicine floor for
medical management.

Social History:
No Tob/EtOH. Independent prior to 1st hip fracture.
Daughters [**Name (NI) **] (Healthcare proxy) and [**Name (NI) **] and son.


Family History:
Non-contributory.

Physical Exam:
On admission:
VS Tc 99.0, P 100-115, BP 105/46, resp 18, 95% on 10 L face
tent.
Gen: elderly, chronically-ill appearing female, collar in place.

Head: NCAT
Mouth: MM dry
Cardiac: Tachycardic, regular no M/R/G
Pulm: Diffuse expiratory wheezes and scattered rhonchi
Abd: NABS, soft, NT/ND
Ext: In traction L hip, cast in place at R arm.
Pulses dopplerable on L, palpable on R no edema.


Pertinent Results:
Chest Xray ([**10-4**]): Allowing for the differences in rotation and
technique, there likely has been no major change in the
appearance of the bilateral pleural effusions, left basilar
atelectasis/airspace disease and mild pulmonary vascular
congestion.
.
Chest Xray ([**9-19**]):  Slightly more pronounced perihilar markings
and hazy opacity right upper zone most likely reflects early
CHF.
.
CT head ([**9-30**]): 1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage identified.
2. Multiple chronic large and small vessel infarctions.
.
Cardiac ECHO ([**9-22**]):  Symmetric LVH with mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction. Mild aortic stenosis. Moderate
mitral regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.  Compared
with the prior study (images reviewed on tape) of [**2142-8-3**],
septal hypokinesis is new, and mild aortic stenosis is now
identified. The other findings appear similar.
.
Xray ([**9-19**]):  Humerus fracture. No evidence of associated elbow
dislocation.  There is a fracture of the distal left femur,
which is not completely imaged on this study. There has been
placement of a traction pin through the distal left femur, with
slight posterior displacement and minimal anterior angulation of
the distal fracture fragment.
.
Speech and Swallow ([**10-6**]):  PO diet of nectar thick liquids and
pureed solids when fully awake and seated upright.  Continue
with tube feeds for supplemental nutrition and hydration.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:
[**Age over 90 **] year old woman with HTN, asthma, osteoarthritis, and GERD who
presented with L femur and R humeral fracture status post fall.
Admitted to MICU for tachycardia, periods of hypotension and
hypoxemia, and falling hematocrit. Tachycardia improved with
volume resuscitation and with pain control.  On hospital day 3,
the patient underwent ORIF of her L femur fracture and reduction
of R humeral fracture.  Her post-operative course was
complicated by new onset atrial fibrillation which was
controlled with diltiazem and for which prophylaxis was started
with lovenox.  In addition, the patient had an NSTEMI with
evidence of new septal hypokinesis on cardiac ECHO.  Her MICU
course was also complicated by [**Age over 90 **] UTI.
Transferred to the medical service for medical management of
pulmonary edema.  Developed a pseudomonas bacteremia, for which
patient was treated with vancomycin, gentamicin, and
ciprofloxacin.
.
1)  Humeral and femur fracture:
  Right humeral and left humeral fracture. Right humerus in cast
and left intramedullary nail in place.  Pain managed with
hydromorphone.  As patient developed transient decreases in
blood pressure when administered IV, better results achived when
administered SC.  Previous enterobacter (necessitating hardware
removal in [**1-9**]) and MRSA required lifelong doxycycline
treatment.  Enoxaparin 60mg q12hr used for DVT prophylaxis and
to anticoagulate.  Lower extremity pulses auscultated by
Doppler, with right greater than left dorsalis pedis pulses.
  Left upper thigh wound slightly erythematous during
hospitalization.  Culture revealed pseudomonas.  Orthopedics
team opted to not remove
