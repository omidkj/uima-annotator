Brief Hospital Course:
Underwent uneventful bilateral common femoral endarterectomies
and distal external iliac endarterectomies with Dacron patch
angioplasties and balloon angioplasty and stenting of both
common and external iliac arteries. Extubated in OR and
transferred to PACU. B/L DP/PT dopplerable. pain controlled. UO
at 22 cc/hr. BP 125/43, off nitro gtt.
POD1- Hypotension overnight BP 86/42 CVP 3-4. Fluid bolus given
with improvement in BP to 114/48. Second event of hypotension to
SBP 50 HCT 28.4. Received 2 units PRBCs. Non contrast CT
negative for retroperitoneal bleed. Hypertensive meds held.
Dopamine gtt started, 5% albumin given for support. Swan
catheter placed. Denies chest pain, abdominal pain. ECG WNL,
cardiac enzymes cycled. Cardiology consult obtained.
POD2-Intermittent hypotensive events, BP 69-110/32-47. Off
