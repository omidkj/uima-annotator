Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1481**]
Chief Complaint:
splenomegaly, ?metastatic disease

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Laparoscopically-assisted splenectomy.
2. Exploratory laparotomy, abdominal washout, crossclamp of the
aorta.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 85y/o gentleman who has a history of mild
splenomegaly that has been increasing slowly.  He is thought to
perhaps have some disorder of myelodysplastic syndrome.  Of note
is he also has had colon cancer and had a
metastasis to his liver.  He was noted on recent scanning to
have some abnormalities in his spleen.  The spleen is also
somewhat increased in size.  It is unclear whether this
enlargement is due to his metastatic disease or progression of
his myelodysplastic syndrome.

Past Medical History:
PMH: AAA with expansion after EVAR, HTN, COPD,
hypercholesterolemia, metastatic colon CA s/p adjuvant
chemotherapy, +ETOH, MDS anemia

colon CA/open CCY '[**63**], EVAR [**2163**], redo EVAR [**2166**]

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the General surgery service on
[**2172-2-26**]. He underwent a laparoscopic assisted splenectomy.
(Please see the operative report for further details.) The
patient was extubated and taken to the recovery room in stable
condition. Upon arrival to the recovery area, patient was noted
to have a SBP in the 80s. His postoperative HCT was 23.1 down 8
units compared with pre-op. 2 units of PRBCs were given and
patient was bolused with IVF to help improve urine output. The
patient's epidural was split as well to improve vascular tone.
His BP actually improved to 100 systolic after these
interventions, but the patient soon became unresponsive. A
central line was placed in the L femoral vein, and patient began
to get hypotensive again to the 60s and was very pale and
tachycardic. He was bolused aggressively, and then taken back to
the OR emergently for re-exploration. (Please see operative note
for further details). Post-operatively, the patient was managed
in the ICU. He was HDS, but was still intubated and on pressors.
A left subclavian line was attempted on [**2-27**], but was
accidentally placed in the artery. This line was promptly
removed and pressure held for 55 min, with no evidence of
bleeding after. A Right SCL was subsequently placed
successfully. The patient was weaned off of respiratory support
and extubated on [**2-28**]. Epidural was restarted for pain control.
He was ultimately transferred to the floor in good condition on
[**2172-3-2**].

Neuro: The patient received epidural with good effect and
adequate pain control. This was discontinued on [**3-2**], and
patient was transitioned to oxycodone when tolerated oral
intake. The patient has history of significant EToH use at
baseline. As such, he was managed on CIWA scale during his
hospital stay. He became intermittently agitated the first few
days post-op and this was treated with small doses of ativan.
However, once he was transferred to the floor, his mental status
greatly improved. He was alert, oriented, and much less
confused. He did show any signs of severe alcohol withdrawal.
CV: Postoperatively, patient was initially on pressors, but this
was quickly weaned off on POD1. Due to h/o AAA, Vascular was
consulted and recommended keeping SBP between 100-140. As such,
patient was maintained on lopressor during his hospital course.
Pulmonary: The patient was weaned off of respiratory support and
extubated on [**2-28**]. The patient's was stable from a respiratory
standpoint after extubation. O2 was weaned as tolerated. Good
pulmonary toilet, ambulation and incentive spirometry were
encouraged throughout hospitalization.

GI: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV fluids.
Once extubated, the patient was started on sips and advanced to
regular diet as tolerated. Due to intermittent confusion and
agitation, patient did not take much po initially. However, this
improved during his hospital course. His diet was supplement
with ensure shakes. Prior to discharge, patient was eating
larger amounts of food and tolerating it well. An abdominal
ultrasound was performed on [**2172-3-4**] to rule out splenic/ portal
vein thrombosis and it showed no evidence of thrombosis. On
[**2172-3-5**] a CT scan was performed to evaluate for subdiaphragmatic
collection due to persistent hiccups. No collection was seen on
CT and patient's hiccups were improving upon discharge.

GU/FEN: The patient suffered acute renal insufficiency during
his hospital stay, likely from hypotension, possibly exacerbated
by cross clamp of aorta during re-exploration. His Cr
post-operatively was maximally elevated at 2.8. The patient was
kept well hydrated and serial Cr levels were measured. His Cr
came down appropriately and was 1.1 at time of discharge.
Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, and IV fluid
was adjusted when necessary. Post-operative, the patient was
several Kg above his baseline weight and was started on lasix
drip in the unit. Cxr's were followed that initially showed
pulmonary edema, but this improved greatly with the lasix. Lasix
was continued on the floor, but then discontinued when patient
was clinically improved. Electrolytes were routinely followed,
and repleted when necessary.

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection.   The patient's wound
remained clean, dry, and intact.
Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.

HEME: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely;
After initial operation, the patient's HCT dropped to 23, down 8
units from pre-op. He was given 2 units of PRBCs at that time.
He also received several more units of blood products when he
was taken back to the OR for re-exploration. Serial HCTs were
checked and on [**2172-3-1**], patient was noted to have a HCT of 22.3.
He was given 1 unit of PRBCs and his HCT improved to 26.4. For
the remainder his stay, the patient's HCT was stable. It was
27.3 at time of discharge. Patient was started on ASA 325 daily
due to rising platelet count. The patient was also started on
coumadin upon discharge for prophylaxis against splenic vein
thrombosis.

VASCULAR: The patient underwent a duplex of his L subclavian
artery on [**2172-2-28**] that showed a 1.9 cm linear tract arising from
the puncture site. Follow up duplex on [**2172-3-2**] showed no
pseudoaneurysm. A CTA was performed on [**2172-3-3**] that again showed
no evidence of pseudoaneurysm. The patient received
mucomyst/bicarb before and after CTA for kidney protection.

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get
up and ambulate as early as possible. Physical therapy worked
with the patient and recommended short term rehab until patient
was back to baseline. He was begun on coumadin for prophylaxis
against sple
