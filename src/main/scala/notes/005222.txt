History of Present Illness:
As Per Neurology H+P:
Patient is a 76 yo RHW with unclear PMH other than HTN and
hx of heavy EtOH use per sister-in-law who last saw her 3 years
ago. Per medical records from [**Hospital3 **] from where she was
transferred, she lives alone and is looked in on by
neighbors.  She was last seen at baseline several days priort to
admission, gardening in the yard.  A neighbor noticed that she
has not been seen for a few days went to check in on her and
found her down.  She was
supine but unclear whether in bed or on the floor and was
nonverbal.  At this time she was taken to [**Hospital3 **].

She was found to be in Afib with RVR at [**Hospital1 **] and was started
on
Diltiazem gtt and had a head CT that showed no hemorrhage or
fracture.  Then, she was transferred here for further evaluation
and care.

Her next of [**Doctor First Name **] is [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 17**] [**Known lastname 16471**], her sister-in-law who reports
that she does not know anything because she last saw her > 3
years ago and the patient has never shown up for family events
despite invitations.  She does report that the patient was a
heavy drinker and was still drinking heavily 3 years ago.

Review of systems was not able to be obtained due to the
patient's dysphasia.



Past Medical History:
1. HTN
2. EtOH abuse


Social History:
Lives alone - no family or children.  Next of [**Doctor First Name **] is [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 17**]
[**Known lastname 16471**] who is her sister-in-law ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 83240**]) and code status
unknown hence presumed full.  Heavy drinker per sister-in-law
and
retired [**Name (NI) **] employee.


Family History:
Father died of MI at age 63 and brother died of kidney
failure at age 59.

response is "okay" to all questions.  No repetition.  Does not
follow commands except for opening and closing eyes - no
appendicular commands or sticking tongue out.

Cranial Nerves:
Pupils reactive and equal.  Does track across midline but less
blinking to threat on R side.  R facial droop.  No gag but
palate
elevates evenly.

Motor:
Diffusely decreased bulk.  Spontaneous movements on L - appers
full strength although individual muscle group testing not
possible.  Does withdraw to pain on RLE and when lifting the RUE
in front of her eyes, no drift.

Sensation: Appears intact to noxious stimuli and LT in all
extremities.

Reflexes:
+2 and symmetric for UEs but trace on L patellar vs. 2 for R
patellar.  Toes upgoing bilaterally

NCHCT: Appears to have extensive small vessel ischemic changes
and possibly subacute/chronic L putamen infarct.

[**Numeric Identifier 77635**] G TUBE PLACMENT [**6-15**]
Uncomplicated placement of 12 French Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 12433**] percutaneous
gastrostomy tube. The tube may be used in 24 hours, if the
patient is not
experiencing pain. The T-fasteners will fall out on their own in
approximately
6 weeks. The patient can return for routine tube exchange in
three months, or
earlier for removal if no longer needed.

MRI/MRA Brain [**6-1**]
1. Extensive evolving acute infarction, predominantly involving
the anterior
cerebral, deep middle cerebral, and superior middle cerebral
arterial
territories. Small foci of infarction in the posterior/inferior
middle
cerebral arterial territory.

2. Extensive chronic small vessel ischemic disease.

3. Normal head MRA.



Brief Hospital Course:
NEUROLOGY COURSE:
76y RHF with HTN and h/o EtOH use w/ a. fib w/ RVR, right
neglect, right weakness and global aphasia of unknown duration.
Pt was admitted to neuro ICU team for observation and treatment
of A.Fib w/ RVR.  Her neurologic exam remained stable. MRI
showed Left ACA and MCA stroke. she underwent Stroke work up
including echo which did not reveal clot,carotid ultrasound,
HbA1C, TSH, fasting lipids were done.

Pt found to have UTI on UA and treated with bactrim.Her hospital
course was complicated by rapid A fib/ Flutter and was treated
with diltiazem and beta blockers per cardiology inputs.
Neurologically she did not show much improvement and failed
speech, swallow test. she underwent PEG placement. She was later
transfered to Cardiology service for control of heart rate.

CV-Coronary:
Despite heart rates in the 140's and 150's, she has never
desaturated and never appeared to be in pain or respiratory
distress.  She has never had EKG changes consistent with
ischemia, and never made cardiac enzymes.

CV-PUMP: Echo [**2134-6-1**] showed The left atrium as mildly dilated.
No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D,
color Doppler or saline contrast without maneuvers. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated with normal free wall contractility.
[Intrinsic right ventricular systolic function is likely more
depressed given the severity of tricuspid regurgitation.] The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. Mild to moderate ([**12-4**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There
is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.  She has never appeared to be in CHF or
otherwise volume overloaded, and her pressures have tolerated
high doses of diltiazem, though 90mg qd is likely the max dose
her pressures can handle given occasional dips into the high
80s.

CV RHYTYM:
The patient arrived to the cardiology service on 180 SR
Diltiazem with diltiazem drip.  She was converted to 90mg
Diltiazem q6h.  After starting this regimen her HR never exceded
110 BPM, and in fact she remain in Aflutter with a rate of 72.
Given that AFlutter is notoriously difficult to rate control, we
evaluated her for TEE and D/C cardioversion.  However the team
felt on examining the patient that she would not be able to
cooperate in TEE exam and that it would be traumatic with high
liklihood of faillure.  Because she never seemed uncomfortable,
even with excessively high heart rates we decided to send her to
rehab for 4 weeks of anticoagulation and have her return to see
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] to evaluate her for D/C cardioversion at
that juncture.  We can tolerate HR up to 150 if she has no
hemodynamic instability or obvious discomfort with it.
- Please continue on 120mg Diltiazem in
