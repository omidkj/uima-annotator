Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
CODE STROKE for aphasia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 89 year-old right-handed woman with a PMH of HTN who
presented to the ED with aphasia. Per her grand-daughter, she
was in her USOH this morning. She was then known to have a
conversation with a neighbor while in bed around 6-6:30 pm. It
she was reportedly not feeling well. It was a "brief
conversation" but no speech impairment was notice. Her family
then came to see her around 7:15pm and was found to be unable to
produce fluent sp each and with limited comprehension. She was
brought to the ED and a code stroke was called. Neurology was at
the bedside at 7:36pm.

I contact[**Name (NI) **] her [**Name (NI) 6435**] office, [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 11456**], MD [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2177**]
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 11454**], her [**Medical Record Number 80244**] is [**Numeric Identifier 80245**]). I spoke with the
covering physician who reviewed her records and confirmed that
she has a hx of afib but was not anticoagulated given a history
of falls. No reported recent surgeries, bleeding or head
traumas.

IMAGING:
ECG ([**9-23**]): Baseline artifact. Atrial fibrillation at a rate of
85 with wider complex beats which are ventricular versus
aberration.

CXR ([**9-23**]): FINDINGS: No previous images. Enlargement of the
cardiac silhouette with hyperexpansion of the lungs. Some
prominence of interstitial markings could reflect elevated
pulmonary venous pressure, chronic lung disease, or both.
No evidence of acute focal pneumonia.

CTA Head/Neck ([**9-23**]): IMPRESSION: Area of ischemia seen within
the left MCA territory. Narrowed region of left M2 segment with
a paucity of distal branches seen.

CT Head ([**9-24**]): IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial
hemorrhage.

EEG ([**9-24**]): IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due to diffuse slowing
with some leftsided accentuation at times with a moderate to
moderately severe diffuse encephalopathy with lateralization to
the left side and accentuation thereof.

TTE ([**9-24**]): The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%) in limited views. Right
ventricular chamber size and systolic function are probably
normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
