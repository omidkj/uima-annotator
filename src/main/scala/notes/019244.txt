Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6114**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The pt. is a 75 year-old female with a history of COPD,
pulmonary fibrosis, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes
mellitus and colonic adenocarcinoma who presented from [**Hospital **]
Rehab with shortness of breath and chest pain.  The pt. herself
is a poor historian and the history is per the nursing notes
from rehab and the pt's. son and daughter. [**Name (NI) **] the nurse's note
from rehab, the pt. developed chest pain which radiated to her
left arm and desaturated to the low 80's early the morning of
admission while being changed.  An EKG was performed at the time
which was significant for 3mm up-sloping ST elevations in V1-V3.
 She was given an aspirin and metoprolol and was transferred to
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED for further evaluation.

Further discussion with the pt's son and daughter revealed that
the pt. had been experiencing fevers approximately 5 to 6 days
ago.  She also had a cough productive of yellowish sputum.
Apparently she had a chest Xray at the time which was suggestive
of pneumonia and she was started on levofloxacin.  She was also
started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin on the day PTA.

In the emergency department, the pt. reported that the chest
pain had resolved without intervention.  Her first set of
cardiac enzymes were not elevated. An EKG was performed which
showed atrial fibrillation, ST elevations in V1-V3, TWI in V5
and V6 and LBBB.  She was initially saturating at 77% on 5L O2
via nasal cannula and improved to 96-100% on 2L NC and 95% face
tent.  Her chest Xray was remarkable for pulmonary edema.  She
was given 40mg IV lasix and urinated 1L.  She was also given
combivent nebs and one gram of each vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress.

On presentation to the MICU, the pt. complained only of some
difficulty breathing.  She stated that the reason she came to
the hospital was for a "panic attack."  She is unclear on the
exact events that caused her to come to the hospital.  She did
not complain of fevers, chills, diaphoresis, chest pain, arm
pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, melena, BRBPR.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Hypoxia: The pt. was admitted to the MICU for hypoxia.  The
cause was felt to be multifactorial and secondary to underlying
pulmonary fibrosis, COPD, CHF and pneumonia.  Initially, she was
thought to be in heart failure and was diuresed with some
improvement in her hypoxia on the first hospital day.  Further
diuresis, however, proved unsatisfactory.  A TTE was performed
which revealed preserved global biventricular systolic function,
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension., moderate
mitral regurgitation, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and mild
aortic regurgitation.
Initially, she was treated with vancomycin, and levofloxacin for
pneumonia. After a speech and swallow evaluation was performed
which revealed that the pt. was aspirating, metronidazole was
added for anaerobic coverage.  She deteriorated clinically over
the course of the first three hospital days, however, with
increasing oxygen demands.  On the fourth hospital day, IV
steroids were begun in attempt to treat her underlying pulmonary
fibrosis.  This led to a marked improvement in her clinical
status as her respiratory distress was ameliorated.  She was
eventually weaned down to 4L of O2 via nasal cannula prior to
transfer to the floor.
She continued to do well on the floor and was further weaned to
3L O2 by NC.  Vancomycin was discontinued and the pt was
discharged on Levofloxacin and Flagyl to complete a total of 14
days.  Her steroids were tapered starting the day of discharge
when she was switched from Solumedrol to prednisone 60 mg PO qd.
She will continue on a slow steroid taper after discharge.

2. Anemia: The pt. was noted to have a low hematocrit on
admission.  Workup revealed studies consistent with anemia of
chronic inflammation.  She was transfused a total of one unit of
packed red blood cells for a hematocrit below 27. Her hematocrit
was stable throughout her floor admission.

3. Diabetes mellitus: The pt. had well-contolled glucose levels
on a sliding scale of regular insulin until IV steroids were
begun at which time she required an insulin drip to maintain
adequate serum glucose levels.  She was transitioned back to a
sliding scale of regular insulin prior to transfer to the floor.
She was restartedon Metformin at the time of discharge and may
required sliding scale insulin while on steroids.

4. Aspiration: The pt. had a speech and swallow evaluation on
the second hospital day which showed evidence of aspiration.
Accordingly, she was begun on tube feeds.  A speech and swallow
exam was repeated on [**11-21**], which did not show any aspiration.
Her NG tube was discontinued and she was placed on pureed foods
and was taking pills.

5. Atrial fibrillation: On presentation the pt. was found to be
in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.  This
was successfully rate-controlled with the addition of metoprolol
and digoxin.  She was maintained on warfarin with a therapeutic
INR for stroke prophylaxis.

6. ?Dementia: Pt may have been developing dementia over the last
months.  She was intermittently delerious during her
hospitalization. At the time of discharge she is oriented to
place and person, but not time.
