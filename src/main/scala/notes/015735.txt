Brief Hospital Course:
A 36-year-old man with history of GHB abuse, previous crystal
meth use, HIV, asthma, and MRSA pneumonia who presented to the
ED with chest pain, SOB, tachycardia, headache, and extreme
anxiety in the setting of GHB abuse.

GHB withdrawal: He arrived tachycardic, hypertensive, and
diaphoretic. Urine and blood tox screen were negative on
admission. The toxicology service was consulted in the ED and
recommended phenobarbital for control of GHB withdrawal
symptoms, with benzos as 2nd line if ineffective.  In the ICU,
he was started on a regimen of phenobarbital 30mg TID
(long-acting) with valium 5-10mg PRN for anxiety in between
dosing.  Both of these meds were initially given IV, but were
transitioned to PO overnight.  Since rhabomyolysis is a risk of
GHB withdrawal, CKs were checked and IVF continued at 200cc/hr
initially without any change in renal function.  EKG did not
show any QRS or QT prolongation or ST changes indicative of
ischemia.  Cardiac enzymes were negative.  Social work had been
consulted, the patient was discharged with a cab to the BEST
team to help with placement, as per the BEST team and SW this
was the most likely way the patient would be able to find
placement somewhere for a detox facility.   His adderall was
held during this acute withdrawal period. Toxicology team saw
him and recommended a Phenobarbital taper as instructed on
medication sheet.  He can re-initiate his Adderall following
cessation of his withdrawal symptoms, he has mild withdrawal as
evidenced by anxiety at the time of discharge.

Personality disorder with externalizing style.  Patient blames
others for bad treatment, takes little responsibility for
himself.  This is consistent with prior documented visits with
other health care workers.

0.7.  This resolved to 0.8 the following morning after IVF
hydration.

HIV: CD4 count 479 and he was continued on
