History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 19407**] is a 51 yo F with Type I DM, CAD s/p CABG who
presented with nausea, vomiting and chest pressure.  Her
symptoms started at 5:30 pm with nausea and vomiting which is
similar to her anginal equivalent.  She later developed
substernal chest pressure, [**4-28**] at rest which persisted until
she came to the ED and was given NTG x2.  She denies any
associated dyspnea, light headeness, diaphoresis, arm/jaw pain.
She had not taken Levemir in 2 days because she had lost a
bottle and her insurance would not allow her to fill it early.
She reports that for two days her glucometer was [**Location (un) 1131**] as high
which likely is >500-600.  She was taking increased humalog at
home with meals however her glucose was still running hight.
She takes 325mg ASA daily.
.
On ROS she endorses increased leg swelling over the past several
weeks as well as increased fatigue with exertion.  Otherwise she
denies fevers, abdominal pain, cough, dysuria, hematuria, skin
ulcers or wounds.
.
In the ED T 97.2 HR 55 BP 160/71 100% RA.  Glucose was elevated
at 522 with an anion gap of 22 and positive urine ketones.  She
was initially given reular insulin 10 units x 2 with decrease in
her glucose to 439 and persistant anion gap so she was started
on insulin gtt at 5 units/hour.  She also had an EKG which
showed increased ST depressions and T wave inversions in V3-V6
and new T wave inversions in III and aVF.  She was given NTG x1
and morphine 2mg IV with resolution of her chest pain.  First
set of cardiac enzymes with CK of 93 and troponin of 0.04.  She
was also given zofran 4mg IV x2, compazine 10mg IV x1 and reglan
10mg IV x1 for nausea.  She was given 3L NS prior to transfer.

CXR TWO VIEWS: There has been previous CABG with midline
sternotomy
wires and vascular clips in unchanged position. There are no
pleural
effusions, but there is mild pulmonary edema. No focal
consolidation is
identified. Osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema.

KUB - IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence for ileus or
obstruction. Extensive vascular calcifications.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 19407**] is a 51 yo F with DM1, CAD s/p CABG presenting with
diabetic ketoacidosis and chest pressure with ischemic EKG
changes.
.
#Diabetic Ketoacidosis - The patient's DKA was most likely due
to missing her levemir for 2 days prior to admission.  She
missed this medication secondary to difficulties getting
insurance to cover this medication.  She did not have any
evidence of infection.  She was transferrred to the MICU and
treated with an insulin drip and intravenous fluids.  The [**Hospital **]
clinic was consulted to help manage her blood sugars.  Her blood
sugars stablized quickly and the patient was transistioned to
subcutaneous dosing, and was transferred out of the ICU after a
day.  On the floor, she continued to have nausea/vomiting and
had difficulty tolerating foods.  She did not have any evidence
of bowel obstruction.  It was felt that her nausea may have been
secondary to constipation. Her nausea was improved with reglan
and an enema.
.
#Chest Pain/ischemic EKG changes: She developed substernal chest
pressure shortly after admission.  She was monitored on
telemetry without any arrhythmias.  Her cardiac enzymes did not
increase on serial testing.  However, she did have some
non-specific EKG changes possibly secondary to demand ischemia.
She was treated with an aspirine, lipitor and metoprolol.  She
was hypotensive on admission, but eventually her blood pressure
normalized and she was restarted on the rest of her home
anti-hypertensives (valsartan, amlodipine and lasix).
Recommend outpatient cardiology follow up and possible
perstantine MIBI.
.
#Acute on Chronic kidney disease - The patient presented with
acute renal failure secondary to dehydration in the setting of
DKA.  Her creatinine returned to [**Location 213**] after fluid repletion.

.
#Diastolic heart failure - Patient had a mild increase in lower
extremity edema and fatigue with exertion as well as CXR with
pulmonary edema and elevated JVP.  Patient required diuresis
after fluid repletion.
.
#Hyperlipidemia -  stable. continue atorvastatin
.
#Hypertension - continued outpatient medications as listed
above.
.
#Anemia - mild anemia at baseline for which she takes iron
supplementation.  HCT stable.
