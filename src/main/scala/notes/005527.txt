Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year old woman with a history of severe
allergic angioedema on multiple occasions, asthma, and bipolar
disease, who presents with angioedema after drinking vanilla soy
milk and accidentally injected her thumb with the epinephrine
pen.

# Allergic Angioedema:
The patient had an allergic reaction to soy milk and has a
history of multiple anaphylactic reactions to various food items
within the past year.  In the field, the patient was given an
intramuscular epinephrine injection by EMS.  Once she reached
the ED, she was given another Epinephrine pen injection in
addition to famotidine 20 mg IV, methylprednisolone 125mg, and
50mg diphenhydramine, in addition to albuterol nebulizers.
After admission directly to the intensive care unit for
observation, she was started on a five day prednisone burst, at
50mg day, in addition to standing doses of diphenhydramine for
twelve hours and twice daily famotidine.
.
The patient takes cetirizine daily and PRN benadryl and
epiniphrine injection pens.  She has been seen recently by an
allergist but has not yet had a follow up appointment.  She
expressed concern that she does not know what food are okay for
her to eat, which is frightening for her after having had
multiple such severe reactions in the recent past. We sent a
message to her allergist and her PCP and asked her to schedule
an urgent appointment after discharge.  We instructed her to
avoid all soy products until she follows up with her allergist.
We also instructed her on use of the Epi pen (with spanish
interpreter).
.
# Right Thumb status post accidental Epinephrine injection:
Because the patient had accidentally injected her right thumb
with the epinephrine pen, there was concern for vasoconstriction
and risk of necrosis.  In the ED, she was given about [**11-25**] inch
of nitro paste for vasodilation.  On admission to the ICU, her
thumb tip was slightly cold and pale in color and was very
tender with limited range of motion.  She was given heating
packs overnight to use with the thumb to help return its
circulation; by the next morning, her range of motion had
improved, the thumb was warm, and the patient was no longer
complaining of pain.
Prior to discharge from the hospital, the correct way to use the
Epi pen was demonstrated to the patient, and she understood how
to use it.
.
# Asthma:
The patient has a history of poorly controlled asthma.  She is
on a higher dose of daily fluticasone at home and states that
she normally needs her albuterol inhaler 3-4x/day, which
suggests poor control of her asthma symptoms. As she was stable
on room air without audible wheezes (also on prednisone) we did
not make any changes to her asthma regimen.  She should follow
up with her allergist as soon as possible to get both the
results of her allergy testing and to improve her asthma
medication regimen.
.

# Bipolar Disease: We continued the patient on home dose of
Lamictal.  She denied SI and showed no symptoms of mania.
.
# Vulvar Itch: Patient had been started on nystatin cream by PCP
two days prior to admission  and this was continued in the ICU.
