History of Present Illness:
56 yo with cirrhosis [**3-16**] [**Last Name (LF) 29580**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 30-40 (idiopathic)
transferred from [**Hospital1 **] bacteremic and hypotensive. She
states that she was feeling well up until 3 days ago when she
started having lightheadedness nausea and vomiting, her
lightheadedness was worse upon standing up and worse in the a.m.
The day of her admission she was told that her blood pressure
was low. In addition she had one peripheral IV and further
access could not be obtained, she had a PICC line which was
removed two days prior as she had blood cultures that were S.
epidermidis.
.
In addition the patient states that she has had dysuria and
suprapubic pain for 3 days, with mid back pain (not flank pain)
which felt like UTI symptoms to her.
.
Recently had a 2 month hospital stay from [**Month (only) **] to may of this
year for diarrhea/abd pain/and melena. MR enterography showed
colonic edema c/w portal hypertension. She underwent EGD, during
which she aspirated and required intubation and ICU stay with
levophed and vanc/zosyn. She improved and was extubated. She
also has SBO, for which she went to the OR for lysis, resection,
and placement of an ileoostomy on [**2111-5-15**]. Her GI function
improved. She had some seizure activity while in the ICU, for
which her seizure meds were titrated successfully. She received
a PICC for nutrition and was transferred to [**Hospital **] rehab.
.
In the ED: initial VS were T 97.9 HR 90 BP 82/49 RR 20 O2 97%
RA.
She was noted to have new ARF w/ a Cr of 3.3, baseline is
normal. She was given 4L of NS IVF. A R IJ central line was
placed using sterile technique. CVP was noted to be [**11-23**] and
BPs were still in the 80s systolic so she was started on
levophed which was uptitrated to 0.08 prior to transfer to the
ICU.
.
VS upon transfer to the ICU: T 98.0 HR 84 BP 84/48 RR 18 sating
96% on 4L by nasal cannula.

STUDIES:
========
[**7-29**] PORTABLE CXR
FINDINGS: Single upright portable chest radiograph is obtained.
The lungs
are clear bilaterally. Overlying EKG wires are noted.
Cardiomediastinal
silhouette is unremarkable. Bony structures are intact. A TIPS
is noted in
the right upper quadrant as is the IVC filter and a right upper
quadrant
surgical clip.

IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.

[**7-30**] TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 0-10mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
>55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are seen on
the aortic valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal
image quality. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on
the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2110-10-30**],
the findings are similar. No vegetations identified, but the
quality of images was not optimal.
