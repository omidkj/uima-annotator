CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2187-5-17**]
CT CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY
FINDINGS:
CT coronary angiography revealed a right dominant system with
normal origins and orientations of the left and right main
coronary arteries. The right coronary artery was technically
difficult to evaluate due to artifact from cardiac motion and
change as well as a high heart rate during the examination.
There is apparent noncalcified plaque in the proximal and mid
course of the right coronary artery. There is a short left main
coronary artery, and there is nonobstructive calcified plaque in
the proximal as well as mid LAD. Similarly, there is mixed
plaque in a patent D1. There is also minimal nonobstructive
mixed plaque in the LCX.

CT cine images of left ventricle showed normal wall motion. The
left ventricular end-diastolic volume was 220 cc, the
end-systolic volume was 178 cc, the stroke volume was 42 cc, and
the ejection fraction was 19%. The coronary calcium score was
294 Agatston with bulk of the calcium in LAD.

CONCLUSION:
Global cardiac dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 19%.
Very limited evaluation of the right coronary artery due to
motion artifact and a very high heart rate during the
examination. Within these limitations, there is nonobstructive
mixed plaque seen in the right coronary artery as well as the
left anterior descending coronary artery.
There are multiple calcified pleural plaques and multifocal
areas of pleural thickening consistent with prior asbestos
exposure. There are scattered ill- defined ground-glass
opacities in the left upper lobe which are new since the scan of
[**2187-2-22**] and most likely are consistent with an infectious or
inflammatory etiology. There is a small right basal effusion.
There are several scattered mediastinal lymph nodes with the
largest measuring 15 x 14 mm in a pretracheal location.
There are bilateral pulmonary emboli. There is no aortic
dissection. The coronary arteries arise from the normal expected
anatomic location.
There is a small hiatus hernia. The visualized liver and spleen
appear unremarkable.
CONCLUSION:
1. Multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli with no aortic dissection
and normal origin of the coronary arteries.
2. Calcified pleural plaques and pulmonary nodules along with
pleural thickening consistent with asbestos exposure.
3. Ground-glass opacities in the left upper lobe, most likely
infectious or inflammatory, however, a followup chest CT would
be helpful to ensure complete resolution of these pulmonary
opacities given the background emphysema and prior asbestos
exposure.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 78172**] was admitted on [**2187-5-9**] underwent Flexible
bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage of the right lower
lobe, right thoracotomy, right upper lobe wedge resection,
thoracic tracheoplasty with mesh; right mainstem bronchoplasty
and bronchus intermedius bronchoplasty with mesh; left mainstem
bronchoplasty with mesh.
He was extubated in the operating room and taken to the SICU for
further management with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**] drain, foley and Epidural
managed by the acute pain service.  On POD [**Street Address(2) 78173**]
130's, required increase in epidural rate for better pain
control which dropped his BP requiring pressors and IV fluid
boluses. He was on a clear liquid diet which he tolerated.  On
POD #2 the epidural was decreased and given IV Dilaudid for
pain. He was weaned off the pressors. His oxygen requirements
increased, HR remained ST 130's and not responding to IV
Lopressor. His cardiac enzymes were negative. He was gently
diuresed, aggressive pulmonary toileting was continued. He
developed AFib and was administered an amiodarone bolus/drip and
converted to SR. On POD #3 the epidural was removed and his pain
was managed with a Dilaudid PCA with good control.  His
oxygenation improved, the CXR revealed atelectasis.  On POD #4
the foley was removed, the [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drain was removed.  Cardiology
was consulted who recommended amiodarone PO for 1 month, an
echocardiogram which revealed an EF of 20-25% and severe global
left ventricular hypokinesis with moderate to severe mitral
regurgitation and moderate left ventricular dilatation. Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with preserved right
ventricular systolic function.  Given the above findings a
cardiac CTA angiogram was done and an incidental finding of
multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli were found which he was
started on Lovenox and Coumadin.  His coronary arteries were
normal.  He was discharged to home with [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] of hearts monitor
and will follow-up with cardiology as an outpatient.  He will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks, and his PCP will
manage his Coumadin
