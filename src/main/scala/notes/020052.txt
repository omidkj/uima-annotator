History of Present Illness:
33 M w/ h/o HTN, admitted 1 year ago to [**Hospital1 18**] with hypertensive
urgency, presented to ED with c/o worsening dyspnea over several
weeks, found to have BP 230s/168.  Patient states he has been on
labetalol and HCTZ in the past for blood pressure control, but
that he has had a lapse in health care coverage and has not been
able to afford pills since [**Month (only) 116**] of this year.  Although he had a
"head cold" a few weeks ago, he denies having any fevers or
taking pseudoephedrine for the last several months.  He denies
taking any cocaine.  He denies chest pain, blurry vision,
headaches, confusion, or back pain.
.
Pt c/o episodes of dyspnea over several weeks.  He reports
episodes come on acutely when he is "just sitting there."  The
most he exerts himself is when he climbs a flight of stairs, and
he has not noticed dyspnea or chest pain when climbing the
stairs.  +orthopnea, +paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, +lower
extremity edema, which he says has gotten worse today but has
been increasing over several weeks.  Of note, he does have a h/o
childhood asthma, hasn't used inhalers for years, denies
nighttime cough.
.
In the ED, the patient's VS were T 95, BP 232/163, HR 114, RR
14, O2 100%.  He was given Hydralazine 10mg IV x 1, then placed
on nitro gtt and labetalol gtt with decrease in BP to 171/114
over 3 hours.  He also received ASA 325 and Morphine 4mg IV x 1.
 He was initially given 1L of NS, but when CXR was noted to be
consistent with CHF, he was given 20mg IV lasix with 1200ml
urine output.
.
On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, or syncope.  He does note dyspnea, paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, and ankle edema as mentioned
above.

Pertinent Results:

ST elevations in V1-V4 and T wave inversions in I, aVL, V4-V6.
?Left atrial enlargement (biphasic P wave in V1). The T wave
inversions appear new as change compared with prior dated
[**2172-7-19**].

CXR in ED [**8-13**]:
1.  Findings consistent with interstitial pulmonary edema.
Please correlate with the patient's symptoms.
2.  Apparant cardiac enlargement is likely related to volume
overload, although pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.
3.  Right basilar opacity, though probably in part atelectatic,
may also represent consolidation.
.
CXR [**2173-8-14**]:
Improvement in the right lower lobe patchy opacity and decrease
in the
interstitial markings since the prior examination.  Persistent
cardiac
enlargement.
.
Echo [**2173-8-14**]:
The left and atrium are moderately dilated. There is moderate
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated.  Regional and global left
ventricular function is preserved. Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg).  Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging
are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse.  Mild to moderate ([**12-1**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
33yo man with h/o hypertension and poor access to medical care
presents with hypertensive emergency and signs of congestive
heart failure as well as possible acute on chronic renal
failure.
.
# HTN:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] blood pressure was acutely controlled with
labetalol IV and then switched to oral labetalol after the first
night in the hospital.  His EKG and his cardiac enzymes did not
show evidence for MI.  At the time of discharge, he was given a
prescription for labetalol, and he was given a follow-up
appointment with a PCP at [**Hospital1 18**].
.
Patient has chronic HTN for which he has had difficulty
obtaining medicines.  Given that he has a h/o difficult to treat
HTN on multiple medicines according to prior discharge
summaries, it would be reasonable to consider secondary causes
of HTN.  His TS
