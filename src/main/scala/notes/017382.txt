seen in the LAA. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection velocity.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color
Doppler.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness and cavity size.
Severely depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch
diameter. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR. No
AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: No MS. Trivial MR. Mild (1+) MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial

Physiologic (normal) PR.
PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. Results were
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PREBYPASS
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.
2. No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left
atrium or in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect
or PFOis seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 30 %). The apex and inferior walls were akinetic, the
remaining left ventricular segments are hypokinetic.
4. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending
thoracic aorta.
6. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
7. Mild mitral regurgitation is seen.
8. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results during the
surgery on [**2122-5-18**] at 843.
POSTBYPASS
1. First attempt off bypass; patient is on phenylephrine,
epinephrine and milrinone. Good RV function, new septal
akinesis, continued inferior and apical akinesis. Air seen in LV
apex. Patient went into v-fib, BP dropped so returned to bypass.

2. Second attempt off bypass; more air in apex so returned to
bypass. V-fib again
3. Third attempt off bypass after addition of norepinephrine,
amiodarone; continued air despite aggressive deairing manouvers
4. Fourth attmpt off bypass: no air in LV apex, continued
inferior and apical akinesis, with slight improvement of
previously akinetic septal wall. All other segments severly
hypokinetic with EF 25%
5. Aortic contours smooth after decannulation
6. Mitral regurgitation is now mild to moderate
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: evaluate for ptx s/p lt chest tube
removal
Final Report
REASON FOR EXAM: Left chest tube removal, assess for
pneumothorax. Patient
is post CABG.
Equivocal left tiny apical pneumothorax. Improved atelectasis in
the left
base compared to prior study performed 2 hours earlier
Left chest tube has been removed, other lines and tubes are
still in place.
There are no increasing pleural effusions, stable cardiomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname **] was a same day admission for cardiac bypass grafting
on [**2122-5-18**]. Please see OR report for details, in summary he had:
Redo sternotomy with coronary artery
bypass grafting x2 with reverse saphenous vein grafts to the
left anterior descending and the posterior descending artery.
His bypass time was 69 minutes with a crossclamp of 45 minutes.
He did poorly coming off pump and an attempt was made to place
an intra aortic balloon pump, however
