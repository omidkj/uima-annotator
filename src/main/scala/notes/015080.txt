Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 896**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
74M hx melanoma stg1 resected [**2136**], resected prostate CA [**2172**]
who presents w/ one week of SOB and DOE. He reports he has had
several days of lethargy, low grade fevers, non productive cough
and DOE. Was seen by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**3-4**] with these complaints and
exam was notable for bibasilar rales, R>L LE edema. CXR was done
which showed a new right pleural effusion and vascular
congestion. PCP was concerned for new CHF, w/ question of viral
cardiomyopathy given recent episode of labryinthitis and started
patient on lasix 20 mg PO daily and ordered echo. TTE was
performed on [**3-6**] which showed mild concentric LVH w/ normal
left and right ventricular fx (EF 65%), PA systolic pressure of
30 mmHg, a small pericardial effusion w/o evidence of tamponade.
He was seen in f/u clinic when exam was notable for new
tachycardia to 110s, BP 130/60, O2 sat of 92%, and [**1-12**]+ edema in
R lower leg with JVP of 6 and pulsus of 5. He was sent to the ED
for evaluation of possible DVT/PE.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 98.2 110 137/81 20 90% on room air,
94% 2L NC. Exam was notable for mildly tachypnea and a mildly
swollen RLE with a positive [**Last Name (un) 5813**] sign. Patient underwent CTA
of the chest which showed bilateral pulmonary emboli involving
the right upper, middle, and lower segmental vessels and the
left lower lobe segmental branches. There was no CT evidence of
R heart strain. CT was also notable for a R pleural effusion,
pulmonary nodules, and hilar/mediastinal LAD. Patient was guaiac
negative and started on a heparin gtt w/ bolus and admitted to
the MICU for further management. VS on transfer were: 148/73 100
20 92% on 2L.
.
In the MICU he was placed on a heparin drip and observed
overnight.  His oxygen requirement increased to 4L and he was
saturating 92% on 4L at the time of transfer to the floor.  He
was comfortable, not in respiratory distress, without chest pain
or palpitations.

Pertinent Results:
[**2178-3-9**]   Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
FINDINGS: No previous images. No evidence of pneumothorax.
Cardiac
silhouette is at the upper limits of normal size. Engorgement of
pulmonary
vessels is consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
Poor
definition of the left hemidiaphragm suggests layering effusions
with
associated compressive atelectasis.

[**2178-3-9**]   Radiology [**Numeric Identifier 108421**] INS ENDOVAS VENA
IMPRESSION: Successful uncomplicated placement of an Option
retrievable IVC filter below the takeoff of the renal veins.

[**2178-3-7**]   Radiology BILAT LOWER EXT VEINS
1. Partially occlusive thrombus in the right popliteal vein with
occlusive
thrombus in the right posterior tibial and peroneal veins.
2. No evidence of DVT in the left lower extremity.

[**2178-3-6**] CT Chest:
1. Bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli with relative sparing of
the left
upper lobe branches. Attenuated pulmonary arteries and mild
leftward
interventricular septal bowing concerning for right heart
strain.
2. Conglomerate soft tissue density within the right hilus
concerning for a primary lung carcinoma. Peribronchovascular
opacities, as well as septal
thickening are concerning for extension of tumor and
lymphangitic spread.
3. Moderate-to-severe mediastinal lymphadenopathy and hilar
adenopathy.
Moderate nonhemorrhagic right pleural effusion and pericardial
effusion, both concerning for malignant involvement.
4. Numerous basilar pulmonary nodules concerning for
hematogenous metastatic spread.

[**2178-3-6**] ECHO ([**Location (un) 2274**]):
TTE ([**3-6**]- [**Location (un) 2274**]):
1. Resting tachycardia (HR>100bpm).
2. There is mild concentric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal systolic function
3. The right ventricle is mildly enlarged.
4. The right ventricular systolic function is at the
low normal.
5. The right atrial size is normal. RA collapses in
atrial systole possibly consistent with hypovolemia
6. The aortic valve is trileaflet and is mildly
thickened with trace aortic insufficiency
7. Estimated PA systolic pressure, calculated from peak
TR velocity, is 30 mmHg above RA pressure.
8. Small concentric pericardial effusion. There is no
evidence of cardiac tamponade. Echodensity seen along
RA wall in the effusion (subcostal view), which is
probably the wall of the RA in motion, collapsing from
low filling pressures, but cannot exclude clot.

MICROBIOLOGY:

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2178-3-10**]):
      ENTEROBACTER CLOACAE COMPLEX.    10,000-100,000
ORGANISMS/ML..
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
         Piperacillin/tazobactam sensitivity testing available
on request.
