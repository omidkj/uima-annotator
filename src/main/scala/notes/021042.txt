Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4654**]
Chief Complaint:
hypoxia and hypercarbia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 174**] is a 49 year old male with a PMH of HTN, DMII, OSA,
COPD, CAD s/p IMI and stenting who presents with increasing
shortness of breath, dizzyness, and bilateral lower extremity
swelling over the past 2 weeks. The patient felt like he was
fighting a cold 2 weeks ago and took Airborne. His symptoms
improved, but then he developed a runny nose and post nasal
drainage and began coughing grey-[**Known lastname **] sputum from his lungs.
His dyspnea occurs primarilly with movement/exertion, not at
rest. Over this time period he has also developed worsening
bilateral lower extremity edema that has been painful at times
at the ankles. He denies any prior history of lower extremity
edema. He has also been waking up at night sitting up on the
side of his bed with his CPAP mask off and feeling somewhat
confused. He has had a decreased appetite for the last 3-4 days
with decreased PO intake. He has also felt "dizzy" and when
asked to clarify this states that he has felt lightheaded, as if
he would faint, at times.
.
He presented to the [**Hospital 191**] clinic earlier today and was noted to
have a heart rate of 120 with an 02 sat of 78%. He was sent to
the ED for further evaluation. Vitals on presentation to the ED
were T 99.1, BP 136/90, HR 100, O2sat of 92% 2L. He received
aspirin 325 mg PO, Levofloxacin 750 mg IV, and Lasix 10 mg IV.
On initial presentation on the floor, the patient was
comfortable, in no distress, able speak and relate history
easily, 92%4L. On falling asleep w/o his usual home BiPap w/ 3L,
he desaturated to 78%RA. He was triggered due to hypoxia. On
arousing the patient up, the patient was awake, alert, not
complaining of SOB, but drowsy. Initially, his O2 sat rose to
89% on 4L. Respiratory therapy was called to arrange for
patient's BiPap. He was also given lasix 20mg IV to which he
promptly urinated 650cc. He also received a combivent. His
clinical status continued to deteriorate with 02 sat 80-85% on
10L. ABG was 7.42/90/45. He was placed on CPAP and transfered to
the ICU.
.
ROS: As above. In addition he also endorses diarrhea yesterday
only that has since resolved. He chronically sleeps on 2 pillows
at night and has to sleep on his left side as he cannot breathe
if he lays on his back. He also uses CPAP at night. He has had
no fevers, chills, vertigo, headache, chest pain, melena, BRBPR,
myalgias, arthralgias, or dysuria.

.
EKG ([**2193-1-8**]): Sinus rhythm at the upper limits of normal rate.
Right inferior axis. RSR' pattern in lead V1. Borderline
intraventricular conduction delay. Low precordial voltage. Since
the previous tracing of [**2192-5-8**] the inferior Q waves are less
prominent now. Early precordial ST segment elevations are no
longer present. Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
CXR ([**2193-1-8**]): Limited study with increased left basilar
density, which may reflect atelectasis and effusion though
pneumonia cannot be excluded. Correlation with lateral view may
aid in diagnosis.
.
CXR ([**2193-1-9**]): In comparison with the study of [**1-8**], there is
again blunting of the left costophrenic angle with opacification
at the base. Again, there is asymmetry of the density of the
lungs with the left being somewhat darker. Mild prominence of
interstitial markings persists that could represent some
asymmetric pulmonary edema.
.
TTE ([**2193-1-9**]): The left atrium is dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion. IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to patient's
body habitus. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
right ventricleappears mildly dilated and hypokinetic. No
pathologic valvular abnormality seen. Mild pulmonary artery
systolic pressure hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
49 year old male with COPD (FEV1 1.7 [**3-16**]), CAD, HTN, DMII, OSA
on CPAP who presents with SOB and LE swelling transferred to the
unit for hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure.
