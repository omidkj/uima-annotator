Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 30062**]
Chief Complaint:
lightheadedness & weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
blood transfusions


History of Present Illness:
71yo man with a history of CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical [**First Name3 (LF) 1291**] on
coumadin, s/p ICD for VT/CHB/afib, CHF w/ EF 25-30%, Lupus (in
remission), CKD, chronic anemia on Aranesp, h/o recurrent GIB,
who presents with lightheadedness & generalized wkness over [**2-10**]
days.  The hx comes from both pt and his wife.  Pt had been in
his USOH, until about 3 days ago, when his wife noted the
patient to be more fatigued & sleeping more than usual.  The
patient reports that he began feeling lightheaded w/ standing
(though no syncope) and generally weak during that time.  He
notes that he has had some dark/"black" stools over the past [**3-11**]
days, though reports no abd pain, N/V/D.  (Of note, his hct had
been 34 on routine check 5 days ago.  His INR was
supratherapeutic at that time at 4.29; his coumadin was dose
reduced from 3mg MWF/2mg TTHS to 2mg daily.)  He reports
baseline SOB is stable.  Pt did have an episode of SSCP the day
PTA, which occurred at rest & resolved with nitro.  The pain was
similar to that which he has on a nearly daily basis.  The
patient's symptoms of LH & generalized wkness/fatigue continued
to progress, so he asked his wife to bring him to the [**Name (NI) **] for
eval.
.
In ED: VS T 98, 112, 116/69, 19, 100% on NRB.  His HR dropped
into the 60-70s after triage.  He had one BP of 76/30 & improved
to 117/66 w/o intervention.  Developed SSCP in ED.  ASA, nitro,
and fentanyl were give.  Pain resolved.  EKG reportedly stable &
not evolving.  CE w/ trop 0.07 & CK 44.  Other labs notable for
drop in hct from 33.9-->28 over ~6 days.  INR 4.5.  Stool was
"dark" & guaiac +.  Not NG lavaged. Crt 2.9 increased from
baseline 1.5-1.7.  HCO3 16. UA negative.  Glucose 33 on chem 7 &
Recheck 130s.  Given 1L NS. Pt being admitted to ICU for mgt &
eval of possible GIB & ARF.

ROS: He reports no fevers, chills.  ?wt loss (unsure am't)
Chronic SOB.  Some constipation.  No diarrhea, BRBPR.  + chronic
angina uses 2SL mult days a wk.  Pain occurs at rest usually.
No cough/hemoptysis. No change in vision, hearing.  No HA. No
hematuria, dysuria, LE swelling.  No numbness, tingling, falls.

(12) H/o abnl chest CT: 1.5 cm precarinal lymph node, as well as
a few of lung nodules. Seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in pulm clinic.
(13) Emphysema: Pulmonary function tests done in the office
today were reviewed.  He has an FEV1 of 2.1 liters, which is 78%
of predicted and an FVC of 3.24 liters, which is 84% of
predicted, and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 62%.  This is consistent
with a very mild obstructive deficit.--per pulm note in OMR

Admission CXR:
No acute cardiopulmonary process identified. Unchanged
emphysema.
.
Echo ([**2160-9-2**])
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed (LVEF= 40-45 %); no definite regional wall motion
abnormality is identified although views are technically
suboptimal. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with normal
free wall contractility. The aortic root is moderately dilated
at the sinus level. A bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis is
present. The transaortic gradient is upper normal for this
prosthesis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe mitral
annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The motion of the tricuspid
prosthetic leaflets appears normal. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo man w/ CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical [**Month/Day/Year 1291**], afib, EF 25-30%,
h/o GIB, chronic anemia, CKD second to lupus nephritis, who
presents with lightheadedness and fatigue in the setting of a
drop in his hematocrit and acute renal failure found to have
guiac positive stools.

# Acute on chronic anemia, acute blood loss: The pt was felt to
have a slow UGIB. He was transfused a total of six units pRBCs
with a Hct goal of approximately 30; although his HCT initially
failed to bump appropriately, it did stabilize. The GI service
was consulted and, based on the pt's comorbidities and prior
negative endoscopies, conservative medical managment was pursued
with IV PPI x 72 hours. The pt's home anticoagulation was
reversed with vitamin K; when his INR dropped below 1.5 he was
started on a heparin gtt given his mechanical valve. On transfer
out of the MICU to the medicine floor, the pt's Hct was stable
in the 30s and his INR was 1.5. He was continued on his heparin
to coumadin bridge. Patient's hematocrit remained stable and
required no further transfusions on the medical [**Hospital1 **]. His stools
lightened and patient was switched to po protonix [**Hospital1 **]. Coumadin
was restarted and
