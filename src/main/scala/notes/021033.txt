History of Present Illness:
This is a 54 year old male with HTN, COPD, alcohol abuse
transferred from [**Hospital3 4107**] with jaundice, abdominal
distention and sodium of 104. Originally presented with two
weeks of abdominal pain with solid foods but not with liquids.
When eats solid food gets constant abdominal pain over upper

distended and remained so since. Abdomen feels "tight" and has
"pressure". Denies CP or SOB. No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
dysuria. No similar prior history of either the abdominal pain
or distension.

Went to ED today because pain was not getting better. At OSH ED
serum sodium was 104 and he was noted to be jaundiced. Denies
headache, confusion, falls, weakness, nausea, vomiting or
diarrhea. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further workup.

On arrival at the ED here VS were stable. He was started on
hypertonic 3% NS at 35cc/hr in the ED. Evaluated by hepatology.
Admitted to the ICU for treatment with hypertonic saline. On
arrival to the MICU he appeared comfortable and in no acute
distress.

He has a long history of alcoholism. Last drink 1 month ago.
Before that drank ~8 beers daily. Reports often starting and
stopping drinking in the past and states that there was no
reason in particular he stopped drinking 1 month ago.

         Piperacillin/Tazobactam sensitivity testing performed

         [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3060**].
         This organism may develop resistance to third
generation
         cephalosporins during prolonged therapy. Therefore,
isolates that
         are initially susceptible may become resistant within
three to
         four days after initiation of therapy.  For serious
infections,
         repeat culture and sensitivity testing may therefore be
warranted
         if third generation cephalosporins were used.
