HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was transferred from
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital with a left brain tumor seen on CT scan
today.  The patient is an 83 year old male with a six week
decline in language and motor coordination.  Family first
noticed some word finding difficulty around [**Holiday 1451**] but
more concerned about confusion of his orientation starting
four to six weeks ago.  The patient also has headache and
gait nystagmus thought to be secondary to his tumor, carotid
stenosis and possible transient ischemic attack.  He talked
with his primary care physician yesterday and told to come to
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital today for CT scan.  Large left hemispheric
mass with edema and shift was noted.  MRA was done at
[**Hospital 1474**] Hospital.  The patient loaded with Dilantin and
given 10 mg of Decadron.  There is concern of aphasia and the
patient is unable to provide history.  History is per family.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Heart rate in the 60s, blood pressure
162/70, respiratory rate 12, oxygen saturation 98% in room
air.  In general, the patient was awake and alert and
attentive to examination.  Speech is fluent yet
unintelligible.  The patient is able to follow simple two
steps commands.  The pupils are 3.0 to 2.0 and reacted to
light symmetrically.  Extraocular movements are intact.  He
has a right facial droop.  Tongue is midline, palate elevates
symmetrically.  There is increased tone in the lower
extremities bilaterally.  Strength is [**4-24**] throughout except
right interosseous in hands, [**3-25**].  There is a question of a
slight right sided drift.  Reflexes 2+ in the knees and
ankles and 3+ in the left upper extremity and 2+ in the right
upper extremity.  Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiac is regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.  The abdomen
is soft, nontender, nondistended.

On MR, there is a large 4.0 by 6.0 centimeter mass left
parietal temporal frontal lobe, appears to arise from
meninges, minimal in appearance by T1, edema on T2 and FLAIR
that is enhancing with an irregular shape, no cystic
component, midline shift with edema throughout left
hemisphere.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the hospital
and started on q1hour neural checks.  His blood pressure was
maintained less than 160.  He was started on Dilantin 100 mg
three times a day and Decadron 8 mg q6hours for the edema.
Fluid was restricted to one liter.  The patient was admitted
to the Intensive Care Unit for close attention to all these
things and availability of wider range of medicinal means to
control blood pressure.  Early on while in the Intensive Care
Unit, the patient became delirious and concern of ethanol
withdrawal was addressed.  The patient was given Thiamine and
Folate as well as Ativan p.r.n.  The patient's operative
procedure was initially delayed because there was concern the
patient may have severe heart disease and arterial disease.
The patient was seen by Cardiology but in the end,
angiography and further intervention was held due to the
feeling that the meningioma that the patient had was more
important. As the patient's surgical procedure approached,
the patient had an acute myocardial infarction, being ruled
in with cardiac enzymes, which put off his surgery for some
time while the patient was treated and allowed to improve
post myocardial infarction.  It was the impression of the
neurosurgical team to transfer the patient to the floor post
myocardial infarction for a period of convalescence until
such time that he was able to go to surgery.  However, the
patient developed fever and was determined to have positive
blood cultures and positive sputum, sputum positive for gram
negative rods, blood for gram positive cocci in pairs and
clusters.  The patient was started on Vancomycin and
Levofloxacin.  The patient was then confirmed to have
pseudomonas in his sputum.  His blood had coagulase negative
Staphylococcus and his urine had coagulase negative
Staphylococcus.  He also had a catheter tip with fifteen
colonies of bacteria growing.  His antibiotics were changed
to Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin and Ceftazidime.  The patient
remains in the Intensive Care Unit while on antibiotics and
allowed to improve over time with regards to his myocardial
infarction and pneumonia.  While waiting for the surgery, the
patient's mental status continued to decline and the patient
appeared to become very depressed. Psychiatry was consulted.
The patient was determined not to be an appropriate figure to
make his own medical decisions at that time and that
responsibility was left to the family.  Finally on [**2147-3-2**],
the patient went to the operating room where the left
frontotemporal craniotomy was performed and resection of his
meningioma was accomplished.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well and was returned to the Intensive Care Unit
postoperatively.  The patient had a slow recovery time as he
remained very confused and somewhat somnolent
postoperatively. The patient did, however, improve somewhat
and his activity was advanced and he was able to sit up in a
chair and subsequently began to walk with assistance.  He has
persistently failed swallow studies but at the family's
request, he has been allowed to take small amounts of food by
mouth.  The patient is now transferred to the regular floor.
He is receiving physical therapy and is being screened for
rehabilitation and the patient will likely go to a
rehabilitation facility.  He will need to follow-up with Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1327**] in one to two weeks.  The patient may shower
and observe regular activity.  Prior to discharge, he will be
evaluated again by speech and swallowing.  Decision was to be
made whether or not to give him a percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomy tube prior to discharge.  Also, postoperatively,
the patient suffered from a ventricular tachycardia for which
cardiology was consulted.  The patient was treated with
Diltiazem drip and finally with Amiodarone 800 mg once daily
times one week, 400 mg once daily times two months and 200 mg
once daily thereafter.
