History of Present Illness:
78 yo male awakened from sleep with sharp chest spasm that
radiated down  right arm. It lasted approx. 30 seconds and then
he had multiple episodes over 10 minutes. Has had several
episodes per day. Also noted to have left sided twitching over
precordial area. Had associated nausea.

Pertinent Results:
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right-dominant system

demonstrated one-vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA, LCX,
and RCA
were all free of angiographically-appareny flow-limiting
stenoses.  The
LAD had a proximal eccentric and likely ulcerated 70% stenosis.
2.  Resting hemodynamics demonstrated moderate aortic stenosis
with a
gradient of 19 mmHg.  Right- and left-sided filling pressures
were
high-normal with an RVEDP of 8 mmHg and a PCWP a-wave of 10.
There was
mild pulmonary hypertension with an RVSP of 36 mmHg.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Moderate aortic stenosis.
3. Mild pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Conclusions
PREBYPASS
A patent foramen ovale is present with left-to-right shunt at
rest. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with borderline
normal free wall function. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is moderate to severe aortic valve
stenosis (area ~1.2 cm2 Mild to moderate ([**2-2**]+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within
normal limits).

POSTBYPASS
Patent has poor windows post bypass, LV function appears to
remain good with EF 55% but segmental motion hard to identify.
The aortic contour is smooth post decannulation. An prostetic
aortic valve is well seated in the aortic annulus. Trace
perivalvular leak is seen. Mitral regurgitation is seen post
bypass but remains unchanged from prior study.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**10-6**] and had a cardiology consult done. Cath the next
day showed AS and LAD dz. Carotid US showed [**Country **] 60-69%.  Vein
mapping,echo, and pulm consult also done pre-op. Underwent CABG
x1/AVR (#21mm [**Doctor Last Name **]) with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on [**10-11**]. Please refer to
Dr[**Doctor First Name **] operative report for further details. Transferred to
the CVICU in stable condition on titrated phenylephrine and
propofol drips. Extubated late that night and steroid taper
started. Aggressive pulmonary toilet done. POD#1 he was
transferred to the SDU for further telemetry monitoring ans
recovery. The remainder of his postoperative course was
essentially unremarkable.POD#3 small serous drainage seen  on
his sternotomy incision. Prior to discharge his sternum was
stable, C/D/I. He continued to progress and on POD#4 was
discharged to home with VNA. He was advised on all followup
appointments.
