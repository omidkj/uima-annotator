HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 83-year-old
female with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, seizure disorder, who presented at the
[**Hospital3 537**] with hypoxia and respiratory distress.

The patient had recently been admitted to the [**Hospital6 14430**] from [**2-5**] to [**2-14**] with respiratory distress
requiring intubation.  She was treated for chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation with steroids,
antibiotics including Vancomycin and Cefepime for pneumonia,
and was extubated after two or three days.  The patient was
also treated for hypertensive urgency requiring transient
Labetalol drip.

The patient was discharged back to the [**Hospital3 537**] on [**2-14**] on p.o. dose of Levaquin.  At that time, her white blood
cell count was 19.  She was having low-grade fevers on her
steroid taper, and she had a loculated right pleural effusion
for which the patient had refused thoracentesis.

On [**2160-2-16**], the patient was found by the family at the
[**Hospital3 537**] to have increased respiratory rate and looked
purplish in her extremities.  Her oxygen saturation was found
to be 72% on 2 L which decreased to 63% on 4 L.  The patient
was then transferred to the [**Hospital6 2018**].

The patient had a blood pressure of 176/44, pulse 110, and
oxygen saturation of 70% on nonrebreather and was intubated
for respiratory distress with subsequent hypotension after
induction.

The patient had a chest x-ray after intubation which showed
prominent right hilar area concerning for vascular
abnormality.  A transesophageal echocardiogram was performed
in the Emergency Room which revealed no evidence of
dissection, normal right ventricular size and function, no
acute changes consistent with PE, and normal ejection
fraction greater than 55%.

The patient also had left ventricular hypertrophy with a
small left ventricle.  Due to her hypotension, the patient
received approximately 6 L of intravenous fluid in the
Emergency Room.  She was also given Ceftriaxone and Flagyl,
as well as Lasix.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was initially
hypotensive to the 90s/50s and was given another liter of
normal saline with mild response.  She had a right IJ and
right arterial line in place.  Initial CVP was [**5-18**] after 1 L
normal saline.

The patient required subsequent fluid boluses and Levophed
for a ................ less than 60.  She was pancultured and
continued on antibiotics.

The patient underwent bronchoscopy while intubated which
showed that the trachea and left side of the bronchi were
within normal limits.  The right lower lobe bronchus mucosa
was slightly pale.  Biopsies were taken from the superior
segment of the right lower lobe mucosa, as well as BAL
brushings were obtained.  There was extrinsic narrowing of
the right lower lobe superior segment bronchus.

The patient also had a deep venous thrombosis detected by
lower extremity ultrasound and was started on a Heparin drip.

She continued to have difficult elevated blood pressures
requiring Hydralazine IV.

The patient was extubated on [**2160-2-19**], after one day of
observation postbronchoscopy.

The patient was then transferred to the ACOVE Medicine
Service on [**2160-2-20**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Intensive Care Unit course:  The
patient's Intensive Care Unit course as outline in above HPI.
To summarize, the patient had acute shortness of breath with
chest pain and anxiety at her rehabilitation facility after
being discharged from the [**Hospital6 **] on p.o.
Levofloxacin after having a loculated pleural effusion and
pneumonia requiring intubation.  In the Emergency Department,
she was hypotensive and hypoxic requiring intubation.  She
received a significant amount of volume resuscitation.  She
was treated with intravenous antibiotics, initially
Ceftriaxone and Flagyl and then switched to Ceftazidime and
Vancomycin given her recent hospital stay.

The patient's chest x-ray showed question of wide mediastinum
but no evidence of PE or dissection by transesophageal
echocardiogram.

Other issues included hyponatremia, acute renal failure with
a creatinine of 2.1 which has since resolved.  The patient
was initially treated with steroids for presumed adrenal
insufficiency; however, cortisol stimulation test was fine,
and steroids were discontinued.

The patient was also treated with Bicarbonate for metabolic
acidosis.  The patient was treated with Heparin drip for deep
venous thrombosis.  The patient had bronchoscopy with
brushings and biopsy on [**2-18**] and was extubated on [**2-19**].  The patient also had labile hypertension controlled with
intravenous antihypertensives.  The patient had anemia which
was treated with 1 U of packed red blood cells.

2.  Lung cancer:  The patient had right lower lobe biopsy
which did not show any definite malignancy.  The patient had
bronchial brushings which showed rare atypical cells and
reactive bronchial cells and acute inflammation.  She also
had bronchial washings which were positive for malignant
cells consistent with non-small cell carcinoma with features
suggestive of squamous differentiation.

A family meeting with the patient's son, daughter-in-law and
medical team was had to discuss the new diagnosis of lung
cancer.

The patient was with a chest CT revealing a 6.2 x 5.4 cm low
attenuation lesion in the superior segment of the right lower
lobe of the lung.  The patient had a large 3.5 cm low density
lesion within the liver with peripheral enhancement, likely
metastatic disease.  The patient also has a well
circumscribed small right adrenal lesion and apparently
