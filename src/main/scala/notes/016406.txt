Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 826**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer for initiation of hemodialysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
35 y/o female with PMH significant for type 1 diabetes mellitus
with multiple complications including frequent DKA, ESRD on
peritoneal dialysis, and hypertension transferred from an OSH
for initiation of hemodialysis. Pt was recently admitted to
[**Hospital1 18**] from [**3-9**] to [**3-11**] following a questionable seizure. At
that time, her head CT was negative and her neurologic exam was
within normal limits. Neurology was consulted and felt that her
presentation was consistent with uremia. During this admission,
the pt was also noted to have an anion gap of 16 which remained
stable and she had no ketones in her urine.
.
Pt was then at home until [**3-18**] at which time she was admitted
to [**Hospital3 934**] Hospital with hyperglycemia and [**Hospital3 **]
failure. Per notes, the pt had become lightheaded at home with
two questionable seizure episodes. On arrival at the OSH ED, her
glucose was noted to be 877 and her BP was elevated at
200/110-120. Head CT showed atrophy without evidence of
hemorrhage or ischemia. Labs were remarkable for a BUN of 91 and
a creatinine of 11.2 The pt was admitted to the ICU where she
received treatment with dilantin and IV insulin followed by
stabaliation of her condition. Pt received one time doses of
levofloxacin, vancomycin, and gentamicin. Subsequent blood and
peritoneal cultures were negative. By [**3-20**], the pt was fully
awake and tolerating a [**Month/Year (2) **] diet. She was seen by neurology and
the dilantin was discontinued. Her blood sugars were improved so
she was taken off of the insulin drip and started back on
lantus. An [**Month/Year (2) 113**] was also obtained on [**3-20**] that was significant
for a LVEF of 25 to 30%. mild mitral regurg, moderate tricuspid
regurg, elevated pulmonary artyery systolic pressure at 35 mmHg,
and a small pericardial effusion. The pt is now transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for initiation of hemodialysis as it is felt that she has
failed PD.

Past Medical History:
1. Diabetes mellitus type 1, diagnosed at age 7. The patient
has had multiple episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis in the past.
Her DM is complicated by neuropathy, nephropathy  and
retinopathy.
2. Chronic [**Hospital1 **] insufficiency, now failure with creatinine
around 7, on peritoneal dialysis
3. History of gastroparesis, with episodes of nausea and
vomiting.
4. Atypical chest pain.
5. Hypertension.
6. Asthma.
7. Chronic right foot ulcer being followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 108352**] of
[**Last Name (STitle) **].
8. Chronic diarrhea- incontinant of stool since abcess removed
([**2194**]).
9. Recurrent pyelonephritis.
10. [**Year (4 digits) **] [**3-5**]: EF 75%. No WMA/valvular abnormalities.
11. Chronic diarrhea since [**2194**] when she had an abcess removed
from her anus. Since then she has been on chronic loperimide.
12. history of hematemesis and EGD on [**9-21**] revealed Grade IV
esophagitis with contact bleeding was seen in the distal
esophagus, Erythema in the stomach body and fundus compatible
with gastritis.
13.h/o subdural bleed
14. seizure
15. diastolic dysfunction


Social History:
The patient lives [**Location (un) 6409**]. Her PCP is [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Per
his OMR note, her children have recently been taken by DSS,

ChestXray:
1) Mild congestive heart failure, slightly improved since recent
study.
2) Enlarged cardiac silhouette, most likely due to cardiomegaly
although pericardial effusion is not fully excluded given the
change in configuration and size of the heart compared to
[**2203-12-3**].

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:35 y/o female with poorly controlled IDDM, multiple
admissions/complications, failed peritoneal dialysis, admitted
for intiation of hemodialysis:
1)ESRD: failed peritoneal dialysis, admitted for initiation of
hemodialysis. Venous mapping scheduled and tunnled catheter
placement was scheduled. However, after the third session of
hemodialysis pt decided she no longer wanted to pursue this
therapy and refused placement of tunneled cath/further
hemodialysis. Her peritoneal dialysis catheter was cycled and
functional.  Her temporary dialysis catheter was removed.  Pt
was discharged to FU in 2 days with Dr [**First Name (STitle) 805**] from the [**First Name (STitle) 2793**]
Service.

2)IDDM: pt noncompliant with [**First Name (STitle) 3782**] regiment for DM, started on
lantus with SSI in house, QID FSG, diabetic diet.  Pt was
noncompliant with dietary restrictions in house.  Per nursing
staff pt was constantly eating and making frequent trips to the
cafeteria.  Her FSG were consistently elevated as a result
despite standing lantus/SSI.  Pt was transfered to the MICU for
insulin drip for one day [**1-4**] early DKA. [**Last Name (un) **] followed the
patient and recommended cont of [**Last Name (un) 3782**] insulin regiment and close
[**Last Name (un) 3782**] FU.  Pt was counseled on diabetic diet.

3)CHF: pt with documented systolic dysfunction per [**Last Name (un) **] on [**3-20**],
EF 20%.  Etiology is undetermined.  Pt was well compensated
during this hospitalization. She was scheduled for a repeat
[**Month/Year (2) 3782**] TTE and will FU with her PCP for further evaluation of
this CHF.

4)HTN: pt with poorly controlled HTN, placed on
metoprolol,nifedipine, clonidine patch, added prn hydralizine
initially to keep BP <200/110. Also increased metoprolol to 200
[**Hospital1 **]. Bp was improved at the time of [**Hospital1 **] and pt was given a
script for Toprol XL.

5)Szr d/o: kept on keppra, no szr during hospitalization.

6)Asthma: pt placed on albuterol neb prn in hospital, but did
not require treatment.

7)PPx: heparin SubQ, PPI

8)Acess: pt transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] with a temporary dialysis
catheter, femoral triple lumen.  Both were removed without
complication.

9)F/E/N: pt educated about [**Hospital1 **]/cardiac/CHF/[**Doctor First Name **] diet.

10)Code: Full

11)Dispo: home with FU to PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 2793**], [**Name11 (NameIs) **], [**Name12 (NameIs) 3782**] TTE.
