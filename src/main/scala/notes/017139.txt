Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization


History of Present Illness:
66 year old male with history of bicuspid aortic valve s/p AVR
in [**2187**], complicated by prosthetic valve endocarditis requiring
redo AVR, presented initially to floor with dyspnea.  Upon
arrival to floor, patient experienced acute worsening dyspnea,
without associated symptoms.  BP was noted to be in 180s-190s
systolic range.  Patient triggered and was transferred to
cardiac care unit.  Upon arrival to unit, patient was anxious,
tachypneic, no chest discomfort, and hypertensive to 210s
systolic.  A nitro drip and lasix IV were given immediately,
with good effect.  See hospital course for further details.

ROS notable for increasing lower extremity edema over past few
weeks while self-limiting diuretic use.

Social History:
no tobacco or alcohol use

Family History:
Father died of a heart attack at 76 years
old and had prostate cancer.  Mother died of lung cancer in
her 70s.  There is a positive family history of diabetes
mellitus.


Physical Exam:
initial vital signs notable for oxygen saturation in the mid 90s
on [**3-9**] liters nasal cannulu, with BP, as noted before, as high
as 210s/90s
GENERAL:  well nourished, anxious, tachypneic
HEENT:  PERRLa, NCAT, clear oropharynx, MMM, no thyromegaly
CV:  RRR, S1, S2, no S3 or S4, II/VI SEM at left upper sternal
border, JVD not elevated, 2+ pulses throughout
PULM:  bibasilar rales
ABD:  soft, NT, ND, active BS, no HSM
EXT:  no rash, [**1-8**]+ pretibial pitting edema
NEURO:  CNs II-XII intact, strength and sensation grossly
intact, no cerebellar deficits
SKIN - no rash or evidence of chronic venous stasis

exam at discharge:
BP 130s-140s/70s
lungs were clear to auscultation
edema had resolved

TTE:  Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild to
moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.

ECG:  Sinus rhythm. A-V conduction delay. Prior anteroseptal
myocardial infarction. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2190-10-9**] sinus rhythm is now recorded. The anterolateral ischemic
appearing ST-T wave changes have improved. Sinus rhythm with A-V
conduction delay is now present. The rate has slowed.

Admission CXR:
1. Patchy focal consolidation within the left mid-lung. Followup
to resolution is recommended.

2. Small-to-moderate size right pleural effusion, with
associated
opacification of the lung base, may reflect atelectasis.
Underlying
consolidation not excluded.

3. Stable mild cardiomegaly

Renal ultrasound:
1. Normal acceleration time in the right main renal artery with
no evidence of right renal artery stenosis.
2. Nondiagnostic left renal artery waveforms.
3. Normal appearance and size of both kidneys.
4. Morphological appearance of mild benign prostatic
hyperplasia.

Cardiac cath:
1. Elevated right and left sided filling pressures.
2. Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension.
3. Moderate systemic hypertension.
4. High cardiac output state.

Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right sided and left
sided filling pressure with an RVEDP of 17 mmHg and a PCWP mean
of 27 mmHg. There was severe pulmonary hypertension with a pasp
of 65/27 mmHg. There was a high output cardiac index of 4.37
L/min/m2. The femoral arterial pressure was moderately elevated
with a pressure of 163/55 mmHg which correlated with the
noninvasive cuff pressure.

CT Chest, Abdomen, Pelvis:
1. Diffuse bilateral central pulmonary opacities with associated
fissural
fluid and pleural effusions, large on the right and moderate on
the left
side, favoring pulmonary edema with superimposed infection.
Pulmonary
hemorrhage cannot be ruled out.

2. No additional source of infection or acute process identified
in the
abdomen or pelvis.














Brief Hospital Course:
66 year old male with history of bicuspid aortic valve s/p AVR
in [**2187**], complicated by prosthetic valve endocarditis requiring
redo AVR, presented initially to floor with dyspnea.  Upon
arrival to floor, patient experienced acute worsening dyspnea,
without associated symptoms.  BP was noted to be in 180s-190s
systolic range.  Patient triggered and was transferred to
cardiac care unit.  Upon arrival to unit, patient was anxious,
tachypneic, no chest discomfort, and hypertensive to 210s
systolic.  A nitro drip and lasix IV were given immediately,
with good effect.  The patient continued to receive aggressive
IV diuresis, and was maintained on a nitro drip until blood
pressure was better controlled with long-acting nitrates and,
arterial vasodilators, and non-specific beta blockers, in
addition to his home regimen.  It was thought that the patient
presented in flash pulmonary edema secondary to severe
hypertension, and an underlying pulmonary infection could not be
ruled out.  Bronchoscopy was entertained but ultimately not
pursued given likelihood of pulmonary edema as etiology of
radiographic lung findings.  There was no evidence of myocardial
ischemia as the etiology.  No diastolic murmur was noted on
exam, there was a low suspicion for recurrent endocarditis, and
TTE did not show any vegetation, see above.  A cardiac
catheterization was done to evaluate the patient's refractory
hypertension, and both the BP cuff pressure and central pressure
correlated well.  Initial antibiotic therapy covering
community-acquired pneumonia was soon discontinued after patient
did not develop additional signs/symptoms of infections.  It was
thought that poor renal perfusion in the setting of likely
chronic hypertensive/diabetic nephropathy contributed to the
patient's acute renal failure.  Renal ultrasound did not show
any evidence of obstruction.  Following improved blood pressure
control, the patient's renal function slowly recovered.
Hemodialysis was never indicated.  The patient also received two
units of packed red blood cells with an appropriate response.
The patient was maintained on a basal/bolus insulin regimen.  He
was discharged on [**2196-10-1**] with improved BP control and clear
lungs.  See below for medication changes.
