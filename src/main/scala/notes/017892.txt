Allergies:
Erythromycin Base

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4679**]
Chief Complaint:
left lower lobe lung cancer

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2193-3-8**]
1. Left thoracotomy.
2. Completion left pneumonectomy.
3. Buttressing of bronchial stump with intercostal muscle.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 64-year-old woman who underwent a left upper
lobectomy many years ago for stage 1 non-small cell lung cancer.
 In follow up she developed a
deep lesion in the left lower lobe that on biopsy was positive
for non-small cell lung cancer.  We felt that this was a new
primary cancer and therefore recommended a completion
pneumonectomy.  Staging workup was negative for
metastatic disease and her pulmonary function was acceptable for
the proposed operation.


Past Medical History:
1. Thyroid cancer (papillary carcinoma), status post resection
on
[**2180-6-30**] and post-operative radioactive iodine;
2. Stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer (adenocarcinoma), status
post left upper lobe lobectomy on [**2180-6-30**];
3. Hypertension for over 5 years;
4. Hyperlipidemia for over 5 years;
5. Osteopenia/osteoporosis;
6. Possible asymptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.


Social History:
The patient is retired and was a former accountant. The patient
started smoking cigarettes at age 15, and smoked 2 packs per day
up to age 41.  This places her at an approximate 50-pack-year
history of smoking.  There is no history of significant alcohol
intake.  There is no history of exposure to asbestos. There is
no history of exposure to heavy chemicals or radiation.


Family History:
Has family history of cancer. Father had lung cancer. Mother had
[**Name2 (NI) 499**] cancer as did maternal grandmother. [**Name (NI) **] other cancers in
the family.

CXR ([**2193-3-15**]): FINDINGS: The patient is status post left
pneumonectomy. Slight increase in amount of pleural fluid since
the prior study, with major air-fluid level now at the left
sixth rib level. Small loculations of gas in the mid and lower
left hemithorax has slightly decreased as well, and subcutaneous
emphysema has slightly decreased. Within the right lung,
ground-glass and reticular opacities at the right upper lobe and
more confluent opacity at the right base have slightly improved.
Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Thoracic Sugery service after
elective operation. Her post-operative course is as follows:
.
Neuro: Epidural was placed pre-operatively which provided
adequate pain control. The epidural was removed POD 4 and she
was transitioned to oral pain medications with adequate control.
.
CV:  The patient's vital signs were routinely monitored. On POD
1 she developed hypotension with systolic pressures in the 60-70
range. EKG showed lateral T-wave inversions. Cardiology was
consulted and ECHO was obtained. This demonstrated EF >55%, no
wall motion abnormalities, mild dilated RV with moderate PA HTN.
She was started on aspirin per cardiology recommendations. She
was started on Neo for blood pressure support and was given
Albumin as well. On POD 2 she went into Afib with RVR which
resolved after IV metoprolol was given. Serial cardiac enzymes
were checked with peak trop of 0.11 likely demand ischemia, and
cardiac enzymes trended down. Cardiology recommended continuance
of medical management. She went back into AFib on POD 3 which
resolved with metoprolol. A repeat ECHO suggested low
intravascular volume and a central line was placed to assist
with fluid management. She was given blood and fluids to
maintain intravascular volume and the Neo was weaned off on POD
4. She remained hemodynamically stable thereafter for the
remainder of the hospitalization. On POD 6 she was noted to
become dizzy while standing up and was orthostatic. Hematocrit
was 24 and she was transfused 1 unit of blood. On POD 7 she
noted some chest discomfort after attempting ambulation with PT.
An EKG was checked and was unchaged and the discomfort resolved
spontaneously. She had no further episodes of chest discomfort.

.
Pulmonary:  The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint;
vital signs were routinely monitored. Her chest tube was removed
after drainage was at an acceptable rate. Good pulmonary toilet,
early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged
throughout this hospitalization. She required oxygen throughout
her stay with low room air ambulatory saturations. She was
discharged on home oxygen therapy.
.
GI/GU/FEN: Post operatively, the patient was made NPO with IVF.
The patient's diet was advanced to regular on POD 4, which was
tolerated well.  The patient's intake and output were closely
monitored, and IVF were adjusted when necessary.  The patient's
electrolytes were routinely followed during this
hospitalization, and repleted when necessary.
.
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were
closely watched for signs of infection.
.
Endocrine:  The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout
this stay. She was continued on her home thyroid replacement
medication.
.
Hematology:  The patient's complete blood count was examined
routinely. She received 2 units of blood on POD2 for hematocrit
of 24, with good response and then 1 unit on POD 6.
.
Prophylaxis:  The patient received subcutaneous heparin during
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as
possible.
.
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile
with stable vital signs with normal O2 sat on oxygen.  The
patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding
without assistance, and pain was well controlled. She was
evaluated by PT who recommended home PT which the patient agrees
to. She was discharged to home with clinic follow up. She will
wear home O2, and has home PT and VNA services set up.
