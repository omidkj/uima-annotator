HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 68-year-old
gentleman with a past medical history significant for severe
COPD, AFib, anxiety and depression, who was transferred from
[**Hospital 1562**] Hospital on [**2167-2-22**] to [**Hospital1 190**] for further evaluation of his COPD.
Specifically, the patient was admitted to the CT Surgery
service for evaluation for potential lung volume reduction
surgery.

The patient's primary pulmonologist at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital is
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 55254**] and he referred the patient specifically to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 952**], a CT Surgery attending at [**Hospital3 **].  The [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course from [**2167-2-22**] up until [**2167-3-6**] has been
dictated previously by a CT surgeon on Dr.[**Name (NI) 1816**] team.  To
briefly summarize their report, the patient was transferred
on [**2167-2-22**] with issues including failure to thrive, COPD,
cachexia with severe malnutrition, and a small/medium vessel
vasculitis resulting in multiple skin erosions on all four of
the patient's extremities.

While on the CT Surgery service, the patient was evaluated by
multiple services, including Dermatology, Plastic Surgery,
Vascular Surgery, Infectious Disease, Rheumatology,
Pulmonary, Nutrition, and Physical Therapy.  The Pulmonary
service recommended inhaled steroids as well as
around-the-clock MDIs including Atrovent and albuterol for
his pulmonary disease.  He had pulmonary function testing on
[**2-25**] that revealed a SVC of 2.98, which is 70% of
predicted, a FEV1 of 0.96, which is 33% predicted, and a
FEV1:FVC ratio of 32, which is 47% predicted.  This is
consistent with very severe COPD.

The patient had a CT of the chest with and without contrast
on [**2167-2-24**] that showed no lymphadenopathy, extensive
emphysematous changes bilaterally, and multiple small
bilateral vague patchy areas of nodularity of uncertain
significance.  There were no pleural or pericardial
effusions, no infiltrates.  An incidental finding was made of
an infrarenal aortic stenosis and extensive vascular
calcifications.  Because of this incidental finding, the
patient had bilateral PVR testing that revealed significantly
decreased flow to the right leg and a normal PVR of the left
leg.  The patient subsequently had bilateral lower extremity
angiograms on [**2167-2-27**], which revealed near total occlusion
of the right common iliac artery and therefore, the patient
underwent two stents by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] being placed in that
artery.

As far as further significant events during his CT Surgery
hospital course, the patient was evaluated by Dermatology and
had multiple biopsies of the skin ulcerations.  He was
diagnosed with a medium vessel vasculitis thought to be
secondary to medications.  The most likely culprit is
amoxicillin, which the patient had been taking for a COPD
flare prior to his hospitalization at [**Hospital 1562**] Hospital.
There was no evidence of a systemic vasculitis or
rheumatologic issue based on multiple testing including
negative [**Doctor First Name **], negative rheumatoid factor, negative ANCA, and
negative RPR.

Of note, Infectious Disease was also consulted as mentioned
above at the outside hospital.  These ulcers secondary to
vasculitis on the patient's extremities grew out both MRSA
and Enterococcus, therefore the patient was placed on
linezolid and ciprofloxacin to cover these organisms.  The
reason antibiotics were started was that the patient had a
leukocytosis with a peak white blood cell count of 28,000
while on the CT Surgery service team.  Also from an ID
perspective, the patient was treated empirically for
Clostridium difficile infection because of profuse diarrhea,
which improved with Flagyl.

This describes the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course on the CT
Surgery service as noted in a previous dictation.  It was
felt that because of the patient's multiple comorbidities
including malnutrition and this vasculitis, he was not
currently a candidate for lung volume reduction surgery.

The patient was transferred to the MICU Green Team Resident
Only Service on [**2167-3-9**] for hypercapnic respiratory failure.
 For 24 hours prior to transfer, the patient had been having
difficulty breathing and was somnolent on the floor.  Serial
ABGs showed a worsening hypercapnia.  His ABG on the evening
of [**2167-3-8**] was 7.3, 60, and 80.

The next morning the patient was still having difficulty.
Was noted to be somnolent, and his ABG was 7.21 pH, 80 pCO2,
and 80 O2.  Therefore, the MICU team was called.  The patient
on examination was noted to have diffuse expiratory wheezes
and was found to be in hypercapnic respiratory failure.  He
was transferred immediately to the MICU.  A trial of BiPAP
was initiated as the patient had responded to this in the
past.  An A-line was placed in the patient's right arm
immediately.  After 15 minutes on BiPAP, repeat ABG was pH
7.19, pCO2 87, and pO2 had dropped to 52.  Therefore,
Anesthesia was called for an elective intubation.  The
patient was sedated with Fentanyl, Versed, was intubated and
placed on assist control 550/16 100 FIO2.  Repeat blood gas
immediately after intubation was 7.23, pCO2 of 70, and pO2 of
367.  The vent was therefore changed to AC at 50% FIO2, 550
tidal volume by 20% respiratory rate with a repeat ABG of pH
7.32, pCO2 of 55, and pO2 of 101.

Of note, immediately after intubation, the patient was noted
to become hypotensive with mean arterial pressures between 40
and 50 and required the use of Levophed as a pressor.  A
chest x-ray was obtained post intubation that showed no
evidence of infiltrate, no new pneumothoraces, and no obvious
explanation for why the patient had a hypercapnic respiratory
failure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. COPD:  Patient has had heavy tobacco use for 30 plus
years.  Of note the patient had recently been hospitalized in
[**Month (only) 404**] for a pneumonia and a COPD flare requiring BiPAP use.
Prior to this hospitalization at [**Hospital1 18**], however, the patient
had never required intubation.  A month prior to admission,
the patient had been on p.o. prednisone for COPD flare.
Baseline sats were 93% per outside hospital records.  Patient
was not on home O2.
2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, not anticoagulated.
3. MRSA wound infections in the lower extremities, also
Enterococcus, and gram-negative rods in the wound
infection/vasculitis.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives on [**Hospital3 **].  He lives by
himself.  He is a retired Air Force pilot.  He was a prior
competitive swimmer.  He is separated from his wife since
[**2163**].  [**Name2 (NI) **] has two children, who are very involved in his
care, a son who lives on [**Location (un) **], and a daughter, who lives
in [**Name (NI) 51454**].

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION TO THE MICU:  The patient was
afebrile.  Blood pressure was quite labile ranging from
systolic blood pressure of 60-190/diagnostic of 40-100, pulse
was 70-120 and was regular.  In general, the patient prior to
intubation appeared very labored from a breathing
perspective.  He was quite somnolent and only responded to
questions with a lot of prompting and shaking.  Patient is
very cachectic.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular muscles are
intact.  Oropharynx is clear.  Heart:  S1, S2, regular, no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Lungs:  Diffuse expiratory
wheezes bilaterally, no crackles.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Multiple ulcers in the legs and arms and some
areas of modeling in the legs.  Neurologically:  The patient
was responsive
