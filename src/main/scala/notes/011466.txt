Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5123**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is an 80 year old woman with a history of COPD, CHF, AVR,
[**Doctor First Name **] pneumonia, with a recent [**Hospital1 18**] admission for abdominal pain
thought likely [**1-5**] gallstones, who now presents with AMS, SOB,
and LE swelling. A history was taken from the patient and her
daughters.
.
On Monday, she was discharged from the [**Hospital1 18**]; she was frustrated
by the leg swelling she continued to have, but understood that
the doctors were recommending [**Name5 (PTitle) 74510**] of lasix because
of concern over her renal function. Tuesday and Wednesday, she
became weaker, sleeping all day on Tuesday, and Wednesday
feeling generally weaker, using the bedside commode instead of
walking to the bathroom when at home, and noting that her legs
were becoming more swollen. Leg elevation did help with this,
and a visiting nurse took measurements at home that suggested no
major change in size of her LEs. Her daughters began noting some
confusion, difficulty with finding the right words sometimes,
and she had at least one illusion or hallucination in which she
thought someone was outside the window when they were not. All
in all, her daughters said, it reminded them of other times when
she has had high CO2. She seemed to have no fevers subjectively
or by VNA measurements, though she did sometimes cough up
sputum.
.
Today, her daughters brought her to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Name (NI) **] with chief
complaint of "SOB/confusion"; her vitals at triage were: 98.4
57  16  98% on room air. However, a run sheet describes her O2
sat as 84% on room air; she was placed on 5L and reached 100%,
and stayed at this O2 saturation as this was titrated to 2L, and
1L NC. Combivent nebs x2 were given; azithromycin 500 mg PO x1
was given; albuterol was given; the patient was placed on NIPPV
by respiratory and based on possible ongoing need for NIPPV, was
admitted to the MICU. By the time she arrived in the MICU, she
was back on nasal cannula, breathing comfortably and satting
well.
.
Of note, on her previous admission, she had pulmonary and
cardiology pre-op evaluation for possible cholecystectomy.  From
a cardiology standpoint, she was considered low-risk, but
pulmonary put her at a high risk for failure to wean from the
vent based on a FVC of 1.4 and an FEV1 of 0.52; ultimately, with
the resolution of her possible biliary symptoms, and these
risks, surgery elected not to go forward with an operation.
Because she desaturated to <88% while ambulating, she was sent
home with home oxygen.


Past Medical History:
1. COPD/Emphysema - Unclear disease extent, followed by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of [**Hospital1 1474**], currently managed on Symbicort and
Atrovent. Per [**Doctor Last Name **] consult note: "Patient suffers from a
combination of bullous emphysema with lung changes from [**Doctor First Name **], as
well, although disease has been stable for the past several
years.  Occasional asthma-like symptoms, as well."
Most recent PFTs from [**2118**]:
FEV1 = 36% of predicted
FEV1/FVC = 54% of predicted
2. S/p AVR [**2119**] - Post-operative course complicated by prolonged
vent wean
3. CHF - EF >65%, so presumably diastolic
4. HTN
5. Hyperlipidemia
6. Hypothyroidism
7. Hx of [**Doctor First Name **] PNA ~20 years ago, treated
8. s/p tracheostomy [**10-10**] after AVR, stayed on vent
9. s/p cataracts

Social History:
Patient is a retired office worker. She has a 20-30 pack-year
history but quit smoking 20 years ago when she got [**Doctor First Name **]. She
current drinks approximately 3 glasses of [**Doctor First Name **] per week.
Denies illicit drug use. She has 4 children--3 girls and 1 boy--
and around a dozen grandchildren. She lives alone in her house
and can complete ADLs. She walks independently of a cane or
walker and still drives.

Family History:
Mother died at 86 of Alzheimer's. Father died at 81 of emphysema
complicated by pneumonia. Oldest daughter has asthma, mother
also had asthma. Patient has four children--all in good health.

Imaging:
[**2122-7-18**]: CXR
FINDINGS: Comparison is made to previous study from [**2122-7-17**].
Since the previous study, there has been no significant interval
change. There are again noted multifocal areas of cystic changes
and fibrotic bands particularly in right upper lung fields.
Pleural thickening is seen at the lung apices bilaterally and
also are stable. Patient has severe emphysematous changes. The
opacity at the right base is again seen and unchanged. No large
pleural effusions are seen. Cardiac silhouette and mediastinum
is grossly within normal limits.

[**2122-7-18**]: Head CT
FINDINGS: There is no intra- or extra-axial hemorrhage, masses,
mass effect, or shift of normally midline structures. The
ventricles and sulci are moderately prominent, suggestive of
age-appropriate involutionary changes. There is asymmetry of the
brain, which is likely due to patient positioning. There is
bilateral periventricular white matter hypoattenuation,
particularly in the frontal region suggestive of chronic
microvascular ischemic change. There are basal ganglia
calcifications in the right side. There is no acute major
vascular territorial infarct. There is a left ethmoid osteoma.

Echo [**2122-7-18**]
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. LVEF >65%. Right
ventricular cavity enlargement with mild free wall hypokinesis.
Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Well seated aortic valve
bioprosthesis.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is an 80 year old female with PMH significant for
severe COPD (no home O2 at baseline), CHF with diastolic
dysfunction (>55% EF), AVR in [**2119**], remote h/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] pneumonia who
was hospitalized for altered mental status, fatigue, dyspnea and
bilateral lower extremity edema. She was seen on [**2122-7-9**] for
abdominal pain diagnosed as gallstone pancreatitis but was not
deemed a surgical candidate due to previous history of prolonged
extubation. During this prior hospitalization, she was
determined to be in acute renal failure and her PO lasix was
discontinued.

altered mental status, and some dyspnea.  ABG of (7.28/88/217),
