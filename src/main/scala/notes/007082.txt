Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 106**]
Chief Complaint:
asystolic arrest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac cath
TEE

History of Present Illness:
Source: Medical records, patient's wife, and ER physician from
[**Name (NI) 1474**] hospital

53 yo m with h/o AVR secondary to staph endocarditis,
polysubstance abuse, Hep C cirrohis, DM2, obesity,
hyperlipidemia, and atrial fibrillation transferred to [**Hospital1 **]
following asystolic arrest at [**Hospital1 1474**] ER. Earlier in the
morning around 6AM he awoke and told his wife that he was not
feeling well, was having chest pain and anxiety, and wanted to
call EMS to take him to the hospital. He was brought to the ED
in good condition, requested to go to the restroom to urinate,
walked back to the bed, was placed on telemetry, and became
bradycardic. Immediatly, he had an asystolic arrest at 8:07 AM,
CPR was initiated, he was intubated and recieved epinephrine,
atropine, Narcan, vecuronium, and Ativan. He regained a
perfusing rhythm at 8:16 AM. EGK done right after this showed V1
and V2 St elevations with ST depressions in V4 - V6. He was
started on heparin, given an ASA per NGT, and medflighted to [**Hospital1 **]
for urgent cardiac cathertization.

He entered the cath [**Hospital1 **] at 11:49AM. The cathertization revealed
coronary arteries without signficant athroscherotic disease and
no interveanable lesion. Hemodynamic analysis in the [**Hospital1 **] were:
wedge 48, RA 30, RV 77/16, PA 60, CP 3.8, CI 1.7 and low paO2 pn
100% FiO2 and Peep 10. IABP placed to assist in afterload
reduction, though no hypotension present. Intra-cath echo
revealed very poor LV fxn, ejection fraction of 20%, with mod MR
and mild AI. In the cath [**Hospital1 **] he recieved 80mg IV lasix.

Past Medical History:
1. Polysubstance abuse: Long history of heroin and cocaine abuse
currently taking methadone from a methadone clinic.  His wife
says has not used illicit drugs for quite some time though
occasionally takes illicit Klonapin.
2.Alcoholism: Clinic notes report that the patient had recently
begun drinking heavily again. His wife [**Name (NI) 103128**] that he was
drinking a few beers a week and 1 pint of vodka a week.
3. Hep C.
4. Nodular Cirrosis due to Hep C and ETOH.
5. Aortic endocarditis: s/p porcine AVR in [**2164**] following MSSA
endocarditis c/b both left and right heart failure, septic
emboli to kidney and spleen.
6. s/p left axillary bypass [**2164**].
7. atrial fibrillation.
8. h/o suicide attempt though wife denies this.
9. depression/anxiety
10. DM2.
11. chronic back pain.

Social History:
Lives in [**Hospital1 1474**] with common law wife with who he has lived
with for 31 years. Has no children. He used to work in
construction but for the last 6 years has been on disability.

He has an extensive history of cocaine, heroin, and alcohol
abuse with multiple admissions here for detoxification. His wife
reports he has not used cocaine or herion for a long time and he
goes to a methadone clinic. He is drinking 1 - 2 beers per week
according to his wife, however clinic notes report that he has
been drinking more heavily than that.

Family History:
Brother has a history of herion abuse.

EKG:
s/p epi after cardiac arrest:
NSR 140, ST elevation in V1, V2; ST depression in V3-6, II, III,
F and I

PORTABLE AP CHEST: An endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are
in satisfactory position. A swan ganz catheter is present, and
is coiling in the region of the right atrium. The cardiac
silhouette is enlarged, and there is evidence of congestive
heart failure with vascular engorgement, perihilar haziness, and
bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left. No
pneumothorax is identified on this supine study.
Note is made of previous aortic valve replacement.

IMPRESSION

1. Coiling of swan ganz catheter in the right atrial region, as
discussed
with the clinical service caring for the patient.

2. Congestive heart failure.

Cardiac cath:
COMMENTS:     1.  Selective coronary angiography revealed a
left-dominant system.  The LMCA was angiographically normal.
The LAD
had a 30% mid-vessel lesion.  The LCx was dominant and without
flow
limiting stenoses.  The RCA had no angiographic evidence of
disease.
2.  Left ventriculography was deferred.
3.  Resting hemodynamics revealed severely elevated left and
right-sided
filling pressures (RA mean 29mHg, RVEDP 28mmHg, PCWP mean
46mmHg).  The
calculated cardiac index was 1.71 l/min/m2.  These findings were

consistant with cardiogenic shock.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Severe systolic and diastolic ventricular dysfunction.

CT Head:
FINDINGS: There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass
effect, shift of the normally midline structures or
hydrocephalus. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]/white matter differentiation is grossly
preserved. Osseous structures are unremarkable. There is
aerosolized fluid within maxillary and sphenoid sinuses and
ethmoid air cells.

IMPRESSION

1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or edema.
2. Polynasal sinus disease.

EEG:
FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: At 5 uV of sensitivity, a low voltage, [**2-5**] Hz
delta
frequency background was seen. With auditory and noxious
stimulation,
no change in the background was evident. At one point in the
tracing,
a burst of central [**10-14**] Hz alpha frequency activity was seen
that
appeared to be artifactual in nature. Replacement of the T1
electrode
appeared to correct this finding.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed as the patient was
unable t
