History of Present Illness:
79-year-old male with ischemic CHF NYHA IV (EF 30%), BiV ICD,
pAFIB, CKD (Cr 1.6-1.8), hx of LGIB (angioectasia colonoscopy
[**2179**]), presenting with worsening fatigue and dyspnea, and a 20lb
weight gain over 2 months. Last discharge from [**Hospital1 18**] in early
[**Month (only) **] after a prolonged hospitalization for CHF exacerbation.
Closely monitored via home visits by [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2147**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 107826**], NP. Weight
has been steadily increasing, as diuretics were decreased due to
low blood pressures. Fatigue and dyspnea have also worsened
though he has remained ambulatory and independent. On morning of
admission, he was able to slowly get to the bathroom with walker
as well as dress himself, though complaining of significant
fatigue.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.3 80 114/61 18 98% 2L Nasal
Cannula
and exam showed he was breathing comfortably when HOB >45
degrees (but not flat); no respiratory distress but
uncomfortable. Rales at bases.(+)LE edema to thighs. CXR was
unremarkable. Labs significant for K of 6.8 and a Cr of 2.0.
Patient given 40mg IV lasix and put out 200cc of urine. Also
given Ca gluconate, kayexalate, insulin/D50.
Vitals on transfer were T97.8, HR 84, BP 95/61, RR 15, POx
100%RA.
.
On arrival to the floor, patient was somnolent but arousable.
Complaining of dyspnea. No other complaints.

EKG [**2180-8-6**]: Probable atrial fibrillation with rightward axis.
Right bundle-branch block and intermittent demand ventricular
pacing. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2180-5-15**] no
significant change other than atrial fibrillation with a
moderately fast ventricular response.

Imaging:
CXR PA and LAT [**2180-8-6**]: PA and lateral radiographs demonstrate
unremarkable mediastinal and hilar contours. Cardiac silhouette
demonstrates stable enlargement.  Biventricular pacemaker leads
are identified with leads positioned in the right atrium and
bilateral ventricles. Sternotomy sutures are midline and intact.
There is stable background of increased interstitial markings
consistent with the fibrotic lung changes identified on the [**5-14**], [**2180**] chest CT. There is a stable increased opacity at the
right lung base, which appears to correspond to more confluent
fibrotic changes identified on the prior CT.  The bilateral
costophrenic angles are minimally blunted, which may reflect
scarring and chronic change, but trace pleural effusions may be
present. No pneumothorax is evident. Overall exam is relatively
unchanged compared to [**5-14**] and 28, [**2180**].

CT ABD & PELVIS [**2180-8-7**] W/O CONTRAST:
IMPRESSION:
1. Increased opacification in bilateral lower lobes including
ground-glass
opacification, consolidation and interlobular septal thickening
may represent pulmonary edema superimposed on background lung
disease; however, underlying infection cannot be completely
excluded in the correct clinical setting.
2. Foci of air in the subcutaneous fat likely represent
injection sites, but clinical correlation is recommended.
3. G-tube site is in normal position with no adjacent focal
fluid
collections.
4. Simple left renal cyst is noted.
5. Anasarca including a small quantity of ascites.


Brief Hospital Course:
Primary Reason for Hospitalization:
80 yo M with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial
fibrillation, and a biventricular pacemaker admitted for
worsening of his CHF, with a 20lb weight gain, dyspnea and
significant edema.
.
Active Issues:
# Goals of care: Palliative care was consulted to assist with
clarifying the patient and family's wishes regarding his goals
of care.  He was often reluctant to participate in these
discussions and expressed that he would prefer his wife make
these decisions.  His wife expressed understanding that his CHF
was endstage but did not want the focus to be on end-of-life but
rather on allowing him to live as well as possible.  They agreed
that they would not want him to be intubated, and his code
status was changed to DNR/DNI.  ICD was disabled, but continued
pacing because it may improve his symptoms.  They also decided
that he would not be re-admitted to the hospital. On discharge,
it was decided that patient would go to inpatient hospice care
and prescriptions for PO morphine and lorazepam were given for
hospice care.

#Congestive Heart Failure with pulmonary edema- The patient was
not able to be diuresed on the floor due to hypotension, and was
transferred to the CCU for IV dopamine with lasix drip as
similar support was required for successful diuresis in the
past.  It was determin
