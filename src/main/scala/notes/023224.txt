Brief Hospital Course:
42 year-old female with a history of COPD, asthma, hypertension,
and essential tremor who presented after being found
unresponsive in setting of fall on [**2132-1-2**], found to be
positive for benzos, barbituates, and Et-OH, per husband, likely
suicide attempt. Patient being treated for aspiration PNA and
has copious secretions. Additionally, patient felt to have
underlying COPD and carries dx of asthma so was treated with
oral steroid taper, now complete. She was successfully extubated
on [**2132-1-8**]. In regards to her suicide attempt, patient was
suicidal while intubated mouthing that she wanted to die. After
extubation, patient was delirious. Psych c/s was obtained
initially for management of delirium and for likely need for
inpatient psych placement given suicidality. Pt admitted to
psychiatry that she was attempting to commit suicide, and that
she had been contemplating it for some time.  Pt medically
cleared, had repeat S&S eval [**1-14**] - able to advance diet to
regular with thin liquids (diabetic diet).
<br>

# Altered mental status
Pt does appear to have progressive mental status clearing over
recent days, which is encouraging; thus reducing liklihood of
significant anoxic brain injury, for which pt was at risk
considering found obtunded and required 10 attempts at
intubation.
- Speech and swallow consult following. Pt cleared for oral
intake with modified diet. S+S will continues to follow, as
mental status improves will likely return to unmodified diet.
(increased diet today - can be reassessed in psych unit in
future)
- continues to appear more awake, able to ambulate with walker.
Delirium appears generally cleared.
<br>

# Respiratory failure/Aspiration pneumonia:
Likely a component of hypercarbic respiratory failure due to
oversedation from combination of alcohol, benzodiazapines,
barbiturates, and other unknown meds ingested by patient. Also
complicating could be her history of asthma and COPD in addition
to the finding of right lung opacity in setting of leukocytosis,
consistent with an aspiration event.
Treated initially with Levofloxacin, and Metronidazole.
Ceftriaxone was added for better PNA coverage; regimen narrowed
to ceftriaxone and flagyl. WBC normalized. Blood/urine/sputum
cultures all negative.
Aspiration Pneumonia:
- Completed 8 days of Ceftriaxone.
- then 2 more days of flagyl po to complete a full course for
aspiration (had flagyl prior)
- continue Incentive spirometer for now
<br>

# Asthma/COPD flare
- Lungs generally clear today, with good AE.
- D/c scheduled nebs
- return patient to her home meds
- Adva
