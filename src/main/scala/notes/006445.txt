HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 72-year-old
female who was recently discharged from [**Hospital6 649**] from the vascular surgery service on [**2110-2-27**]
during which she was being worked up for left calf
claudication and a non healing ulcer.  The angiography had
revealed left superficial femoral artery stenosis at the
adductor canal and during the work up for surgical treatment,
the stress test was found to be positive.  The cardiac
catheterization was performed on [**2110-2-26**] which revealed
severe two vessel disease.  The LAD had moderate diffuse
disease with 80% stenosis in the proximal portion.  The RCA
had an 80% mid lesion and a 90% distal followed by serial
severe lesions distally and it was noted that she had severe
left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.  She was evaluated by
the cardiothoracic surgery service and it was deemed that she
would coronary artery bypass graft prior to having her SFA
bypass by the vascular surgery service.  She was discharged
home and was to return to [**Hospital6 2018**] on the day of admission to have coronary artery bypass
