Admission Date:  [**2121-11-11**]     Discharge Date:  [**2121-11-15**]

Date of Birth:   [**2062-4-20**]     Sex:  M

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 59-year-old
male with a history of hypertension and question of an MI per
the patient in the past, who underwent a stress test in [**2121-5-13**] with borderline EKG changes, no chest pain and achieved
84% maximal heart rate.  He was in his usual state of health
until trying to lift a heavy object on the day of admission
when he developed sudden [**8-22**] substernal chest pain,
epigastric pain with radiation, diaphoresis, nausea, no
vomiting, palpitations, shortness of breath or
lightheadedness.  He went to [**Hospital 931**] Hospital Emergency
Room where he was found to have an inferior myocardial
infarction with sinus bradycardia to the 50's and inferior ST
elevations.  There he was given Aspirin, IV Nitroglycerin,
Heparin and Streptokinase and Aggrastat.  His pain initially
resolved but then increased with worsening of ST elevations
inferiorly.  Also noted was a run of idioventricular rhythm.
The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for rescue angioplasty stent.  He went directly to the
cath lab on arriving at [**Hospital1 69**]
where he was hemodynamically stable, found to have total
occlusion of the mid right coronary artery which was PTCA'd.
The patient developed V fib, was shocked and returned to
[**Location 213**] sinus rhythm.  He underwent stent placement and
developed post dilatation of V tach, V fib, shocked times
one.  Amiodarone was loaded and he was begun on a drip.
Right heart cath showed right atrial pressure of 12, right
ventricular pressures of 40/10, pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 18.  Procedure was complicated by rapid atrial
fibrillation for which the patient received Lopressor IV and
decreased his rate from 130's to 90's.  He continued to have
residual [**2130-1-14**] chest pain on arrival to the CCU and heart
rate of 90-110 atrial fibrillation, systolic blood pressure
130-140.  He denied all other symptoms at that time including
orthopnea, PND, shortness of breath.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for lower extremity edema,
decreased exercise tolerance, history of recurrent chest
pain, melena, bright red blood per rectum.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, asthma,
question of an MI two years ago where the patient got chest
pain, went to the ER, was never cathed but was told he might
have had a heart attack.  High cholesterol and diabetes.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  At home, Accupril, Zoloft and inhaler.  He does
not know the type.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is retired, lives with his wife,
smokes [**3-16**] cigars every day, no alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for early coronary artery disease.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission to the CCU the patient's
hematocrit was 42, white count 8.6, platelet count 266,000,
potassium 4.3, BUN 19, creatinine 1.0, total cholesterol
panel was checked which revealed total cholesterol of 213,
HDL 51, LDL 145, CKs on arrival were 54 with troponin less
than 0.3.  EKG after catheterization revealed atrial
fibrillation at 114, ST elevations 2-3 mm in F, 3 and 2,
small Q waves inferior [**Street Address(2) 4793**] depressions in V2 to V3,
normal axis and intervals.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission the patient was in atrial
fibrillation at a rate of 110-120's, blood pressure 140/90,
satting 99% on two liters, respiratory rate 12.  In general
he was pleasant, in no apparent distress.  HEENT:  Normal.
Mucus membranes were moist.  Neck revealed JVP to angle of
the jaw at 15 degrees, carotids 2+ without bruits, trachea
midline, chest was clear to auscultation without wheezes or
rales.  Cardiovascular exam was irregularly irregular,
tachycardic, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdominal exam was
benign.  Groin had a right groin sheath in place, no bleeding
or hematoma.  Lower extremities revealed no clubbing,
cyanosis or erythema.  Neuro exam was grossly intact.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1) Coronary artery disease.  The patient was transferred to
the floor for vigilant monitoring in the CCU, status post his
right coronary artery stent.  Aspirin was continued.  Plavix
was started for 30 day course.  Aggrastat was continued for
18 hours.  Beta blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy were
initiated.  Lipitor was started 10 mg a day.  Nitroglycerin
and Morphine were given prn to keep the patient pain free.
He remained hemodynamically stable over night.  CCU day #2 he
had no events overnight, no complaints.  The patient was
continued on all medications.  The patient continued to have
an idioventricular rhythm but was hemodynamically stable.
This rhythm was believed to be a peri MI event and was
monitored in tele.  EP was not involved because the patient
was not symptomatic.  Follow-up echocardiogram revealed an
ejection fraction mildly depressed at 45-55%.  Also noted was
severely depressed right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
The right ventricle was moderately dilated and the patient
had inferoseptal akinesis.  The patient continued to do well
and was transferred out of the CCU to the floor.  He was
monitored there on hospital day #3 where he continued to do
well.  At that time it was decided to take him back to the
cath lab for stenting of his left circumflex lesion which had
also been noted on initial cath although it had not been
addressed due to his complications in the cath lab.  The
patient went to the cath lab, had his 90% left circumflex
lesion stented with no significant complications.  He was
transferred back to the floor.  At that time he developed a
small left groin hematoma approximately 1 cm by 2 cm which
remained stable overnight.  His hematocrit remained stable,
did not significantly drop.  He was monitored until the
morning following his second cath at which time he was
hemodynamically stable and deemed safe for discharge home.
He will follow-up with his primary care physician who will
arrange for cardiology care for the patient.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.
