Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea and fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Shocked x1 when in VT

History of Present Illness:
Pt. is an 81 yo female with pmh of diastolic HF, HTN, afib, and
tchy/brday syndrome s/p pacer placement [**2-20**] recently admitted
this month for dyspnea who comes in complaining of one week of
increasing fatigue, dyspnea, and productive cough. She reports
that she was improved upon last discharge last week, but since
has noted worsening SOB at rest and upon exertion, fatigue, and
productive cough. She reports that she has been taking her
medications as directed. She denies other upper respiratory
symptoms, PND, LE edema, CP, palpitations, abd pain, f/c, n/v,
other focal signs of infection. She chronically unable to lay
flat because of dizziness. She reports constipation with no BM
for the past week. Because of this her appetitie has been
decreased, though she is still taking PO fluid.
.
In the ED her CXR was unchanged. First set of CEs were flat. EKG
revealed baseline LBBB. She was seen by cardiology who requested
admission to check pacer.
.
ROS: Negative for fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of
breath, cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
dysuria. Otherwise negative in detail.

Past Medical History:
1. Chronic diastolic heart failure
2. Hypertension
3. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation - on amiodarone treatment
between [**1-/2153**] and [**2-/2153**], then discontinued due to her
history of lung interstitial disease
4. Tachy-brady syndrome s/p dual chamber pacemaker placement
[**2-20**]
3. TIA 17 years ago
4. Hypercholesterolemia
5. Osteoporosis
6. Hypothyroidism (recently diagnosed)

Pertinent Results:
STUDIES:
CXR [**2153-6-5**]:  (dictation). pacemaker with unchanged leads. minor
linear atelectasis. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality
.
CXR [**2153-6-7**]:
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**6-7**], there is a
somewhat better
inspiration but otherwise little change. Again there is evidence
of elevated pulmonary venous pressure with bilateral pleural
effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. The cardiac silhouette is
at the upper limits of normal in size and the pacemaker device
remains in place. Endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are in
similar position.
.
Abdominal film [**2153-6-7**]:
IMPRESSION: Progressive distention of small and large bowel,
most likely
representing worsening ileus. However, given this interval
progression, close interval follow up is recommended, as a
mechanical bowel obstruction cannot be entirely excluded.
.
Cardiac cath [**2153-6-7**]:
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.
2. Reduced left ventricular function with apical hypokinesis.
3. Cardiogenic shock with cardiac index from 1.8-2.0 l/min/m2.
4. Slight improvement in pulmonary artery saturation and cardiac
index
with reduction of alpha pressor agents.
.
Echo [**2153-6-7**]:
IMPRESSION: Hyperdynamic biventricular systolic function with
moderate LVOT obstruction and moderate mitral regurgitation at
the pacing rate of 100 bpm. Lessened LVOT obstruction and mitral
regurgitation with pacing rate of 80 bpm.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2153-1-26**], LV
function is more hyperdynamic and LVOT obstruction is
identified. Mitral regurgitation is now more severe.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was an 81 yo female with h/o diastolic HF(EF 70%),
HTN, afib, and tachy/brady syndrome s/p pacer placement [**2-20**] who
was admitted for lethargy and SOB with plans to interrogate her
pacemaker to look for an arrhythmia. Her pacemaker was
interrogated and no abnormalities were found.  She was ruled out
for an MI with 3 sets of negative cardiac enzymes.  Her CXR was
negative for PNA.  Her cough and SOB was thought to be secondary
to bronchitis.  She complained of urinary frequency and
suprapubic tenderness and had a UTI with no signs of an upper
tract infection.  Her UTI was treated with ciprofloxacin.
.
During her hospitalization she was constipated with abdominal
distention and a KUB revealed dilated loops of small bowel.  She
had not had a bowel movement for one week prior to admission and
was started on colace, senna, miralax, and a bisacodyl
suppository. On the evening of the [**2153-6-6**] she complained of
nausea and on the morning of [**2153-6-7**] she had an episode of
straining in the bathroom and was found down in her room.  Code
blue was called and she was coded for PEA arrest. She received
3mg epinephrine, 1 mg atropine, 3 amps of bicarb, dextrose,
insulin, calcium for a potassium of 5.7 which was 3.8 upon
rechecking. During her PEA arrest, she had an episode of VT
which was shocked x 1 to sinus rhythm. EP was called to bedside
and paced her at 110. After aproximately 15 minutes of CPR, she
regained her pulse. She was started on dopamine, levophed on the
floor. BP stabilized in the systolic 80-90s, she was intubated
on AC and requiring high levels of PEEP. She was transferred to
the CCU.
.
While in the CCU she was in NSR in the 80s and captured at 60.
Her abdomen was distended and she required multiple pressors.
The event precipitating the PEA arrest was unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] shock
was treated with pressors and IVF.  She was emprirically covered
with vancomycin, cipro, and flagyl.  She also received a bicarb
drip for mixed acidosis.  Her CXR showed fluid overload but she
continued to be given IVF aggresively due to her hypotension.
The patient was also in ARF in the setting of her shock.  A KUB
showed dilated loops of small bowel with no clear evidence of
obstruction but it could not be excluded. Surgery was consulted
but the patient was not stable enough for any surg
