none

History of Present Illness:
For the past several weeks the pt has experienced diarrhea, a
gassy/bloated sensation, and abdominal distention. She usually

increased progressively over the past weeks. She localizes the

worse. Nothing has made her symptoms better. She has never
experienced anything like this before.

consumption. She had previously been a social drinker, which to

appointment. Over the past year and a half she has been in
several detox/rehab programs. During her detox programs she
never experienced withdrawal symptoms, including no seizures or
DTs. At the end of [**2143-6-23**] she noticed that her liver felt
hard. At this time her sister also noted that her eyes looked
yellow. The pt also experienced some nausea and itchy skin. In
early [**Month (only) **] she entered a detox program and says that she
has not had any alcohol since this time. Since then she has been
in an intense outpatient program in [**Hospital1 1562**], as well as

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 49yo women with significant alcohol use presents with
diffuse abdominal pain, diarrhea, abdominal distension and
jaundice.
.
1) Liver disease:
Alcoholic liver disease was the presumptive diagnosis due to
history while awaiting other labs. AST/ALT ratio is 2:1. The
possibility of an autoimmune etiology contributing to her liver
disease was initially unclear. Autoimmune serologies done before
this hospitalization were not conclusive. During this
hospitalization [**Doctor First Name **] was 1:1200 with IgG >150% of nml, however,
liver biopsy showed no evidence of autoimmune hepatitis.
.
Her discriminant function ([**Last Name (un) 26460**]??????s score) was >32 by HD2-3.
[**Last Name (un) 57563**] 400 mg PO TID started on HD4. Seroids not started
at this time due to pt's pulmonary infection and unclear benefit
in addition to [**Name (NI) 57563**]. Nutrition and alcohol abstinence
have been stressed to pt througout hospitalization. A
post-pyloric feeding tube was placed on HD 5 for nutritional
support.
.
Transjugular bx on HD7 showed: 1) Moderate lobular predominantly
neutrophilic infiltrate with numerous intracytoplasmic hyaline
and mild fatty change; 2)Trichrome stain shows marked sinusoidal
fibrosis with architectural distortion. No definite cirrhosis
seen. Reticulin stain evaluated; 3) No features  of autoimmune
hepatiti
