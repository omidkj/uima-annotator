Upper airway abnormalities, respiratory failure

Cardiac catheterization
Intubation and extubation
PICC line insertion
Rigid Bronchoscopy

History of Present Illness:
84 yo M with CAD s/p CABG, HTN, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and
recent admission for cellulitis, who initially presented to
[**Hospital3 **] on [**2194-4-16**] with generalized weakness, difficulty
walking, and 2 falls. His hospital course was complicated by
respiratory failure, troponin elevation, and ETT dislodgement
requiring reintubation. Pulmonary was consulted and found that
the patient had arytenoid joint dislocations, subglottic
stenosis, and tracheobronchomalacia. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for evaluation by the interventional pulmonary service.

The patient was initially hospitalized for bilateral lower
extremity cellitis, treated with Unasyn, and subsequently
vancomycin when left ankle culture grew MRSA. He was discharged
on Bactrim and developed generalized weakness, difficulty
walking, and 2 falls, leading to readmission on [**2194-4-16**]. Exam
was notable for fever to 102.2, tachycardia, lower extremity
cellulitis, symmetric weakness. Labs on admission notable for
creatinine 2.0. The patient was felt to be dehydrated and was
treated with IV fluids, along with vancomycin for cellulitis.

On [**2194-4-17**], he developed a sore throat and was noted to have
pustules in his posterior oropharynx with surrounding erythema.
Rapid strep testing was negative. He was seen by ID who was
concerned about a drug reaction to Bactrim versus a viral
process, although this would not explain the patient's bandemia.


On the afternoon of [**4-19**], the patient developed wheezing,
respiratory distress. He was noted to have some swelling in the
upper airway. He was treated for heart failure with Lasix 40 mg
IV and 2 inches of nitro paste, followed by nitro gtt. He was
intubated, but then he dislodged the tube, requiring
reintubation with a glide scope. This showed edema distal to the
cords.

The patient was seen by pulmonary consult on [**4-20**]. The patient
was then extubated. Bronchoscopy showed arytenoid joint
dislocations, subglottic stenosis, and tracheobronchomalacia.
The patient's oropharynx showed increased pustules around the
posterior pharynx as well as underneath the tongue and buccal
mucosa. He was treated with Solumedrol. The patient was
reintubated, although the records are not clear on this point.

Of note, the patient had troponin elevations to 2.64, which had
trended down to 0.89 by the time of discharge. EKG showed sinus
rhythm, left axis deviation, TWI in aVL.

Social History:

"Hitler's Children".  Lives with his wife. [**Name (NI) **] tobacco or EtOH.

IMAGING
cxr [**2194-4-21**]
FINDINGS: The tip of the endotracheal tube lies approximately
2.5 cm above
the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to the proximal to mid
portion of the
stomach. Central catheter extends to lower portion of the SVC.
Probable
small pleural effusions with basilar atelectasis.

ECHO [**2194-4-22**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with mid septal hypokinesis (although views are
suboptimal). Overall left ventricular systolic function is
borderline normal (LVEF=50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen (may be
underestimated). The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.

CT NECK [**2194-4-22**]
IMPRESSION:

1. Limited study due to lack of iv contrast.

2. Limited evaluation of mucosal surfaces due to copious
secretions around
the ET tube. MR could provide additional information as
differentiation
between secretions, mucosal and submucosal structures would be
possible.

3. The orogastric tube is coiled within the pharynx, although
subsequently
passes into the esophagus.

4. Dependent atelectasis and possible bilateral pleural
effusions in the
imaged upper lungs.

5. Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine
including mild
spinal canal narrowing at C5-6 secondary to a posterior disc
osteophyte
complex.

CARDIAC CATH [**2194-4-25**]
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrates severe three vessel coronary artery disease. The
left
anterior descending is totally occluded proximally and patent
beyond the
LIMA touchdown wiht an 80% lesion distal to the touchdown. The
circumflex artery gives off a large first obtuse marginal that
contains
an 80% stenosis. The right coronary artery is occluded and the
distal
vessel is perfused via the vein graft to the PDA.
2. Bypass graft angiography demonstrates a patent vein graft to
PDA and
patent LIMA.
3. Limited resting hemodynamicsdemonstrate elevated systemic
blood
pressure.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Systemic hypertension.
