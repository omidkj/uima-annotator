Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 443**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Mitral valvuloplasty


History of Present Illness:
75 y/o F with hx of CAD, severe recurrent MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] valve
from [**2171**], afib, and diastolic CHF presents with worsening
hypoxia and shortness of breath as an inpatient pre-op for
mitral valve replacement. Patient had been admitted to [**Hospital1 1516**] from
[**3-15**] to [**4-1**] for workup of SOB. Thought to be mostly due to CHF,
although has history of COPD and sarcoidosis as well.
.
This admission, she was admitted Sunday [**4-13**] as scheduled admit
for pre-op but had worsening shortness of breath and pedal
edema. Prior to admission at home she had been doing well. She
was on home oxygen and had been monitoring her I/Os and avoiding
salts without any change in her breathing. Then the morning of
admission she noticed her legs were slightly more swollen than
normal. While an inpatient, she continued to get more SOB and
have more swelling. She was hypoxic and treated for CHF
exaccerbation with lasix.
.
Plan for surgery was was cancelled. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**]
team for further management of her hypoxia.
.
Today she is feeling better than she was the last few days. She
does complain of a cough. Has had low grade fevers, but no
sweats or chills. Her cough is non-productive. She denies chest
pain. She thinks her swelling has improved.
.
On review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. She denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, syncope
or presyncope.

1. Resting hemodynamics were performed. The right sided filling
pressures were significantly elevated (mean RA pressure was
21mmHg). The
pulmonary artery pressure was significantly elevated measuring
80/37mmHg. The left sided filling pressures were significantly
elevated
with mean PCW pressure at 36mmHg. The systemic arterial
pressures were
within normal range measuring 110/63mmHg.
2. Intracardiac echocardiography was used throughout the
procedure for
identifcation of anatomic structure, placement of devices and
assessment
of valvular function.
3. Successful balloon angioplasty of the prosthetic mitral valve
using a
Inoue balloon inflated to 19mm.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Coronary arteries are normal.

[**5-6**] Echo
Impression: Severe stenosis of the bioprosthetic mitral valve
due to restricted leaflet motion and probable pannus ingrowth.
Mild mitral regurgitation. Right ventricular hypertrophy,
dilation, and hypokinesis. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. The
left ventricular cavity is small in size with hyperdynamic
function.

Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old F with hx of CAD, diastolic CHF and AS/MS who
presented for scheduled redo sternotomy and AVR/MVR is
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for worsening SOB and hypoxia thought to be
secondary to CHF exacerbation and pneumonia.
.
# SOB - was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] from CT [**Doctor First Name **] for worsening SOB
and hypoxia in the setting of CHF exacerbation prior to her
scheduled AVR/MVR.
