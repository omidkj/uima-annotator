Pertinent Results:
[**2146-8-12**] Pre CPB: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated.
There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen.
Due to co-existing aortic regurgitation, the pressure half-time
estimate of mitral valve area may be an OVERestimation of true
mitral valve area. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
[**2146-8-11**] Cath: 1. No significant CAD. 2. Moderate systemic
arterial hypertension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Dr. [**Known lastname 86435**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2146-8-11**] for
surgical management of his aortic valve stenosis. He underwent a
diagnostic cardiac catheterization in preparation for his
surgery which revealed less then 50% stenosis of the left
anterior descending artery and right coronary artery. A
rheumatology consult was obtained due to his history of
polychondritis and steroid dependence. It was recommended that
he continue prednisone with the possibility of adding CellCept
in the future in the event that his symptoms worsen despite his
daily prednisone. Dr. [**Name (NI) 86435**] was worked-up in the usual
preoperative manner. On [**2146-8-12**], he was taken to the operating
room where he underwent an aortic valve replacement using a [**Street Address(2) 68430**]. [**Hospital 923**] Medical Epic Biocor tissue valve. Please see
operative note for details. Postoperatively he was taken to the
intensive care unit for monitoring. He required continuous
pacing for underlying asystole. On postoperative day one, he
awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. He required
intravenous medication to control his hypertension. He was
transfused for postoperative anemia. On postoperative day three,
his underlying rhythm was complete heart block alternating with
a junctional rhythm. The electrophysiology service was consulted
for assistance in his care. As his underlying rhythm did not
i\improve, a pacemaker was placed on [**2146-8-16**]. He was then
transferred to the stepdown unit for further recovery. He was
gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. The physical
therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. Interrogation of his
pacemaker showed it to be functioning properly. He continued to
make steady progress and was discharged to [**Hospital1 86436**] on [**2146-8-18**]. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **],
his cardiologist and his primary care physician as an
outpatient.
