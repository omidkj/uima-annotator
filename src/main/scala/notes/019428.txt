Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Capoten

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation, central line, PICC line, PEG tube placement

History of Present Illness:
This is a morbidly obese [**Location 7979**] 53-year-old man with DMII,

hypertension, AF, and cocaine-induced MI in the past who p/w 3
days of worsening SOB. He was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 18291**]/08 for
CHF exacerbation [**1-14**] cocaine use. Now presents with 3 days of
increasing dyspnea at rest and on exertion, PND, and orthopnea.
The patient does not know if his LE edema has increased. The
patient denies any chest discomfort, cough, fevers or chills but
feels like "fluid on the lungs". He does note some abdominal
distension after meals but no abdominal pain, N/V/diarrhea. He
states that he has been taking all his medications and has
actually been taking 120mg PO lasix [**Hospital1 **] for 2 days prior and
then 160mg PO BID for 2 days before admission but states that he
did not increase his urination. Patient notes that he has been
eating primarily vegetables and fruits but occasionally eating
sardines. Adamantly denies using cocaine but positive on tox
screen.
.
EMS was called and by report EtCO2 was 80 but improved to 50s
after a neb. In the ED, initial vitals 98.9 128 (AF) 164/106 37
88%RA, --->96%CPAP. A CXR showed no definite evidence of
pulmonary edema but severe cardiomegaly. He was started on
BiPAP, nitro gtt, heparin gtt, given lasix 100mg IV and then
another 60mg IV, Solumedrol 125mg, Levofloxacin, and Ceftriaxone
to treat multiple causes of dyspnea. LLE LENIS showed no DVT.
CTA was not done because of inability to lay flat even with
BiPAP. BNP was elevated at 663.


Past Medical History:
History of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction in [**2129**]. [**7-22**], [**2132**], echocardiogram showed bilateral atrial dilation, severe
concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, ejection fraction of
greater than 55%, trace mitral regurgitation, diastolic
dysfunction. On [**1-5**], a Persantine MIBI showing a moderate
reversible perfusion
defect in the anterior and inferolateral walls with an ejection
fraction of 23%. On [**2134-1-20**], there was a
catheterization that showed normal coronaries and global
hypokinesis. [**6-/2138**] PMIBI showed mild reversible inferior wall
perfusion defect in the presence of considerable soft tissue
attenuation, although the calculated left ventricular ejection
fraction is 46%, visual observation suggests that the ejection
fraction is normal.
# Congestive heart failure, systolic (most recent EF from [**2137**]
PMIBI of 46%), diastolic w/ severe LVH
# Severe pulmonary HTN noted on [**2133**] c. cath
# Gout.

# Atrial fibrillation, chronically anticoagulated w/ coumadin.

community.

[**2141-10-8**] EKG - Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response. Low QRS voltage in the limb leads. Poor R wave
progression which is probably a normal variant. Lateral ST-T
wave changes which are non-specific. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2141-7-12**] rapid ventricular response is new. Otherwise,
no other significant diagnostic change.

[**2141-10-8**] EKG - IMPRESSION: Limited study due to poor
penetration. Severe cardiomegaly with no definite evidence of
pulmonary edema. Left retrocardiac region was not completely
evaluated. Underlying pneumonia can not be excluded.

[**2141-10-8**] Bilat LE ultrasound - IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT in
either lower extremity.

[**2141-10-8**] CXR - FINDINGS: As compared to the previous
examination, the patient is now intubated. The tip of the
endotracheal tube projects 2 cm above the carina and should be
pulled back by 1 to 2 cm. The newly placed nasogastric tube
shows a normal course, but the tip of the tube is not visible.
Extensive cardiomegaly that is unchanged as compared to the
previous examination, subsequent retrocardiac atelectasis at
both the left and the right lung base.  Nobvious evidence of
overhydration.

[**2141-10-10**] CXR - IMPRESSION: Right subclavian central venous
catheter ends in the right atrium.

[**2141-10-18**] CT abdomen/pelvis - IMPRESSION:
1. Diverticulosis without diverticulitis.
2. No evidence of colitis.
3. Small amount of free fluid throughout the abdomen and mild
edema within
the subcutaneous tissues of the back.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions, with consolidation at the
visualized
lung bases, likely reflects atelectasis. However, superimposed
developing
pneumonia cannot be excluded.
5. Right adrenal nodule is larger. Adrenal CT washout study
suggested.
Result posted in Critical Readings dashboard. incompletely
characterized.

[**2141-10-23**] Bilateral lower extremity veins - IMPRESSION: No
evidence of deep vein thrombosis in either leg.

[**2141-10-23**] CT sinus/mandible - IMPRESSION:
1. Pansinus opacification as detailed above.
2. Opacification of the mastoid ear cells and fluid in the
bilateral middle ear cavities.
3. Exophthalmos with prominent retrobulbar fat suggesting
possible thyroid
ophthalmopathy. Clinical correlation is recommended.

[**2141-10-27**] TTE - The atria are markedly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. No masses
or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. There is no aortic
valve stenosis or regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen (poor-quality study). Normal
global biventricular systolic function. In presence of high
clinical suspicion, absence of vegetations on transthoracic
echocardiogram does not exclude endocarditis.

[**2141-10-28**] CXR - FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**10-24**],
