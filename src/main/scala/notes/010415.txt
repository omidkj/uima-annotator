[**2154-12-25**], sinus bradycardia, rate 49, inferior
lateral flat T-waves.  On [**2154-10-1**], CT of the thorax was
stable, no lesions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the transplant
service.  He was made NPO after midnight.  IV fluid was
started.  Lab work was sent off to use preop for the OR.
Labs preop:  White count 3.7, hematocrit 38, platelet count
38, fibrinogen 135.  Coags:  PT 17, PTT 37, INR 1.6.
Creatinine 1, BUN 19, sodium 139, potassium 3.9, chloride
105, CO2 26.  The UA was negative.

He was taken to the OR on [**1-18**] for orthotopic liver
transplant.  Surgeon was Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], co-surgeon was
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**].  EBL was 2 liters.  He was replaced with 5
liters of crystalloid, 6 units of FFP, 6 units of packed red
blood cells, 3 bags of platelets and 1 bag of cryoglobulin.
Please see operative report for details.  The patient was
intubated and taken to the surgical intensive care unit in
critical, but stable condition.

He was given induction immunosuppression of 500 mg of Solu-
Medrol, 1 gram of CellCept intraop.  In the SICU, his
hematocrits were followed closely.  He was replaced with IV
fluid.  Hematocrit was 30.6.  He was weaned and extubated.
His LFTs trended down.  Properatively, his AST was 1463, ALT
1116, alkaline phos 55, total bilirubin 3.9, and an amylase
of 279.  On postoperative day 2, his AST was 476, ALT 746,
alkaline phos 56, and a total bilirubin of 1.2.  A duplex
ultrasound of the liver demonstrated perihepatic ascites.
Portal veins and hepatic veins were visualized with normal
direction of flow, poorly dopplered hepatic artery waveforms
were noted, likely secondary to technical limitations.  A
repeat ultrasound was done on postoperative day 2.  This
demonstrated appropriate waveforms and directionality of flow
within the portal veins, hepatic veins, and hepatic arteries.
His LFTs continued to trend down.  Vital signs were stable.
His preop weight was 113.  On postoperative day 1, his weight
was 130.5.  He began on IV Lasix and his weight trended down
and achieved a weight of 116.7 no postoperative day 14.

His hematocrit trended down to 23.5 on postoperative day 9.
He received 3 units of packed red blood cells.  A repeat
hematocrit was 26.9.  He received another unit of packed red
blood cells as well as 1 unit of platelets for a platelet
count of 74.  Post-platelet transfusion was 114 and a post-
hematocrit was 32.1.  His hematocrit remained in the range of
28 to 29 for the remainder of his hospital course.  He did
undergo abdominal CT with and without contrast to evaluate
for any bleeding.  The CT demonstrated no cause for drop in
hematocrit.  There was moderate hepatic artery stenosis
noted.  There was narrowing of the portal vein at the area of
the anastomosis as well as mild stenosis at the origin of the
right renal artery.  A small amount of ascites and
perihepatic fluid was noted.  There were multiple low
attenuation areas in the transplanted liver likely
representing simple cysts.

When the patient was in the SICU, as he awakened, he
complained of pain control.  Patient was on Methadone 145 mg
p.o. q. d. at home and he had not been on this as of
postoperative day 2.  Dilaudid 2 mg IV q. 1 hour was
ineffective in relieving the patient's pain, so the Dilaudid
was increased to 4 mg IV q. 1 to 2 hours.  Methadone was
restarted.  The patient was started on clear liquids.  He
tolerated this without incident.  His blood sugars were
elevated and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] consult was obtained.  He was placed on
an insulin sliding scale to achieve normalization of blood
glucoses.  He was hypertensive while in the SICU.  He was
given Hydralazine and Lopressor.  Blood pressure improved and
ranged between 130s to 140s down to 90 to 100 systolic.
Lopressor was changed to p.o.  His Solu-Medrol was tapered
per protocol and he was started on 20 mg on postoperative day
7 of Prednisone and he remained on CellCept 1 gram b.i.d.
throughout this hospital course.  Prograf was started on
postoperative day 2 at 2 mg p.o. b.i.d.  Prograf was adjusted
and titrated to levels.  Prograf level increased to 18.9 on
postoperative day 8.  His dose was decreased and he was
stabilized on 2 mg p.o. b.i.d. with a Prograf level of 9 to
14 on 2 mg twice a day.

He was transferred to the medical/surgical unit where he
continued to recover slowly.  Pain control continued to be an
issue.  Consult was obtained.  Recommendations included
continuation of Methadone 145 mg q. a.m. and adjusting
Dilaudid p.o. to 8 to 16 mg p.o. q. 2 hours p.r.n.  For the
remainder of this hospital course, his pain continued to be
monitored.  He complained primarily of right upper quadrant
discomfort.  Towards the end of his hospital stay, his pain
was lessened and he was receiving 4 mg p.o. approximately 4
times a day.

A physical therapy consult was obtained.  PT worked with him
to ambulate.  Given his deconditioning, it was recommended
that he continue home PT.  He has 2 [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains; #1
was discontinued on postoperative day 5 and #2 JP drain
continued to drain approximately 290 cc of serosanguineous
fluid.  On postoperative day 7, he was started on IV
Vancomycin for some erythema around the incision at the left
lower quadrant.  This erythema resolved towards the end of
the hospital course and Vancomycin was stopped.  His white
blood cell count remained in the 4.7 to 6.6 range.  The
second JP was removed.  His LFTs continued to decrease.  He
was tolerating a regular diet and needed a lot of
encouragement to ambulate.

On postoperative day 9, patient complained of right neck
discomfort.  His right IJ site appeared mildly edematous.  A
carotid ultrasound was done.  This demonstrated no
pseudoaneurysm.  There was also noted of a right IJ partially
occlusive clot.  He was not started on Heparin or Coumadin.
The [**Last Name (un) **] consult was obtained.  He was maintained
