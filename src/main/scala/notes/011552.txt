Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
GI Bleed.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2127-6-7**] Transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells

[**2127-6-13**] Colonoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12731**] is an 83 year old male with past medical history of
atrial fibrillation, ESRD on HD, history of gastrointestinal
bleeding, .
.
Today, while at rehabilitation at [**Hospital1 **], he was noted to have
several bowel movements with bright red blood and clots, at
least three witnessed episodes of about 200 cc total. Around
that time, his systolic blood pressure was reported to be in the
70's. He was given 1000 cc of NS prior to transfer. He initially
presented to [**Hospital6 12736**], where he received one
unit of PRBC's and two liters of IVF. His HCT there was found to
be 26.7.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were notable for a blood pressure
of 89/52. At time of arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], he had received four
liters of IVF. NG placement for lavage was attempted, however
patient refused. While in the ED at [**Hospital1 18**], he had no further
episodes of bleeding, however rectal exam was notable for bright
red blood. Due to concerns over some possible guarding, at CT
abdomen was completed. GI was consulted from the ED as well. In
the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he received one unit of PRBC and 500 cc of NS.
.
He also received 1 gram of vancomycin, 400 mg of IV
ciprofloxacin, and 500 mg of IV flagyl after his urine was noted
have an appearance "of pus."
.
On the floor, he reports that he feels "okay," and has no
complaints.

IMAGING/STUDIES:

ECG [**2127-6-7**]: Baseline artifact. Sinus versus ectopic atrial
rhythm. Borderline P-R interval prolongation. Left axis
deviation. Consider left anterior fascicular block of right
bundle-branch block type. Since the previous tracing of [**2127-4-29**]
the rate is slower and the axis is less left superior. The QRS
complex is narrower. ST-T wave abnormalities are improved.

CXR [**2127-6-7**]: FINDINGS: Portable AP view of the chest was
obtained. A dialysis catheter is again noted with its tip in the
region of the superior vena cava. There is a vascular stent
traversing the left brachiocephalic vein. Low lung volumes limit
the evaluation. Cardiomegaly is again noted with scattered
bilateral reticular lung opacities, which appear grossly stable
compared with multiple prior exams. Possibility of mild
congestion cannot be entirely excluded, though there is no overt
CHF. A small left-sided pleural effusion cannot be excluded as
well. Mediastinal contour is grossly stable. No pneumothorax is
seen. Bony structures are unchanged with degenerative changes of
the left shoulder and right humeral head prosthesis.
Degenerative changes are also noted in the spine. IMPRESSION:
Cardiomegaly, possible mild fluid overload.

CT abdomen/pelvis [**2127-6-7**]: IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence for
mesenteric ischemia.  2. Colonic diverticulosis, without
evidence for diverticulitis. 3. Stable focal dissections in
distal abdominal aorta and left common iliac extending in to the
proximal left external iliac artery. Stable fusiform aneurysm of
the left common iliac artery. 4. Thickened bladder wall.
Correlate clinically with evidence of urinary
tract infection. 5. Heterogeneous renal enhancement, compatible
with multiple small renal cysts in the setting of hemodialysis,
unchanged from prior study. 6. Nodular liver again suspicious
for cirrhosis. Stable pneumobilia suggesting prior biliary
intervention.

Colonoscopy [**2127-6-13**]: severe diverticulosis


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 12946**] is an 83 year old male with past medical history of
ESRD on HD, atrial fibrillation, HD line infections, and prior
GI bleeds who presented with bright red blood per rectum.

#) Bright red blood per rectum: Concerning for lower GI bleed
(though cannot exclude upper source), given history of similar
episodes in past. Last colonoscopy was [**2123**], at which time
diverticulosis was seen along with an abnormal patch of mucosa
in the rectum and a rectal polyp. EGD in [**2122**] was normal.
Differential included repeat diverticular bleed, AVM,
malignancy, among other causes.  NG lavage refused by patient.
The patient received 1 unit of pRBCs on arrival, with subsequent
stabilization in Hct to ~30.  IV PPI was started, 2 large bore
IVs placed.  GI team was consulted, and did not see any urgent
need to scope. The patient was transferred to the medicine
floor.  Spine consult was called prior to EGD, with
recommendation for keeping head in neutral position throughout
procedure. Colonoscopy was performed which revealed severe
diverticulosis which was deemed causative factor for bleed and
