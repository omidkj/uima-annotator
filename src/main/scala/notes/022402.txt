[**Age over 90 **] yo f with hx of AMS and reported worsening respiratory status
admitted for now SOB, hypoxia and found to have UTI and CXR
changes concerning for CHF with possible PNA.

edema. CXR and BNP are consistent with this dx. [**Month (only) 116**] also have

80mg IV followed by 40mg IV with ICU LOS fluid balance of -
1.4L. Echo and later ACE-I and BB should be considered. Patient

the ED. In the ICU coverage with Vanco + Zocyn was continued to
cover health-care assoiated pneumonia and possibly aspiration.
