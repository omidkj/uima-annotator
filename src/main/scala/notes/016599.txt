HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 75-year-old
woman, with an extensive past medical history, who was
admitted to [**Hospital6 12112**] for increasing
shortness of breath.  She was diagnosed with probable
congestive heart failure and treated with intravenous Lasix.
While her respiratory status did not improve, she was
eventually evaluated by ENT where she was found to have a
superglottic mass on fiberoptic exam.  CT scan confirmed the
presence of this mass.  Then she was seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the [**Hospital6 256**] as an
outpatient and subsequently scheduled for surgical management
of this problem.

1. Lipitor 20 qd.
2. Atenolol 25 qd.
3. Glyburide 5 qd.
4. Celexa 20 qd.
5. Effexor 75 qd.
6. Protonix 40 qd.
7. Regular insulin sliding scale.
8. Lisinopril was recently discontinued because of mild renal

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2102-7-3**], Ms. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] an awake
tracheostomy and biopsy of a laryngeal mass with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  She tolerated the procedure well, and her
postoperative course by systems is as follows:

1. NEURO:  Ms. [**Known lastname 100103**] pain was well-controlled with IV pain
   medication which was easily transitioned to PO pain meds.
   Her mental status was within normal limits.

1. CARDIOVASCULAR:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was hemodynamically stable
   throughout her hospitalization.  Postop EKG was without
   changes.  She was not placed on a rule out.

1. RESPIRATORY:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] had a tracheostomy placed under
   awake conditions in the operating room on [**2102-7-3**].  She
   tolerated the procedure well.  She stayed in the ICU until
   postoperative day 5, at which time the number 6 trach was
   changed to a number 7 Portex trach.  She currently has a
   number 7 Portex trach.  The sutures were removed on
   postoperative day 6.  The trach is held in place by a
   trach tie.  This should be placed snuggly around the
   patient's neck to allow 2 fingers between the trach tie
   and the neck, but this should be snug.  The patient is a
   very difficult intubation from above.  Extreme care should
   be taken so the trach does not come out.  If the trach
   does fall out, it should be replaced.  If it cannot be
   replaced, an ET tube or an endotracheal tube may be
   substituted for a trach at the time that the trach falls
   out.  From a respiratory standpoint otherwise, she was
   doing very well.  She was saturating well on room air.
   She was ambulating several times per day, and she was on
   her home asthma medication.

1. GI:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was currently tolerating a regular diabetic
   diet.  She was seen by nutrition.  Tube feeds were started
   in the early postoperative period.  This was transitioned
   to a regular diet after an evaluation by speech and
   swallow.  The speech and swallow evaluation consisted of a
   bedside blue dye swallow which showed a question of
   aspiration.  For this reason, a video swallow was
   performed, and a post swallow x-ray as well.  Both of
   these were negative for signs of aspiration.  Her diet was
   advanced.  She was currently tolerating a regular diabetic
   diet

1. GU:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was on her home PO Lasix regimen.  She was
   currently making good urine.  Her creatinine on [**2102-7-8**]
   was 1.2.  This was much improved from her preoperative and
   early postoperative creatinine of approximately 1.6.

1. HEME:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] was transfused on 2 occasions during her
   postoperative period for hematocrit's around 26-27.  Her
   most recent hematocrit on [**2102-7-8**] was 33.1.  She does
   have a history of coronary artery disease.  She was also
   on subcu heparin, and ambulating several times per day.
