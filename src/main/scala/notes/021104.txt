Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 297**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypercarbic respiratory failure.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Tracheostomy replacement.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 68 M with lung cancer, status post trach with vent
dependence, recent post obstructive pneumonia on broad spectrum
antibiotics, prior pulmonary embolus, COPD, hypertension and
diabetes.  He presented from a rehabilitation facility to the
ED, with increased respiratory distress and new opacities seen
on chest x-ray.  He had recently been discharged from the ICU of
an OSH for dyspnea and lethargy.  There he had been diagnosed
with the pneumonia and started on a 14 day course of
vancomcyin/cefepime/flagyl (last day [**9-11**]),  At 11 am yesterday
he was noted to be increasingly tachypneic, a chest x-ray reveal
"white out" in the L lung field (per facility report).  In the
ED the pt was initially alert and interactive.  He was afebrile
but tachypneic, hypertensive and tachycardic.  WBC and lactate
were normal.  Chest X-ray revealed L perihilar lung mass and
opacities in the L lower lobe.  CTA confirmed presence of these
findings and, in addition, was negative for pulmonary embolus.
After the CTA the patient's mental status began to decline and
he became increasingly difficult to ventilate.  He became poorly
responsive and a blood gas returned as 7.02/144/402/40.  It was
believed that there were air leaks around his trach and there
also was possibly some obstruction.  Also of note he was given
labetalol for control of his hypertension and tachycardia.   He
was therefore transferred to the MICU.  In the MICU, the patient
was poorly responsive and exhibited agonal breathing.  A
bronchoscopy was urgently performed and revealed an obstruction
in the trach.  The patient was therefore intubated.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 68 year old gentleman with lung adenocarcinoma,
chronic vent dependence, s/p trach and peg placement, recent
pneumonia on broad spectrum antibiotics presents with
respiratory failure that appeared secondary to blockage seen on
bronchoscopy.  The patient was intubated and placed on assist
control mechanical ventilation with respiratory and mental
status returning to baseline as a result.  Through the remainder
of his admission the patient remained hemodynamically stable.
He underwent repeat bronchoscopy which revealed near complete
occlusion of the trach tube.  The patient did complain of
dyspnea intermittently and there was some concern that he had an
air leak around his tracheostomy tube.  His respiratory status
did remain stable with good oxygen saturation.  For the air leak
the tracheostomy tube was replaced with a larger tube.
.
1) Respiratory failure. The patient arrived with tracheostomy
tube misplaced. The tracheostomy tube was changed and lumen
changed to size 8. Speech and Swallow was consulted for
Passy-Muir placement but were unable to see the patient due to
his recent trach change.  Because he has been intermittently
unable to speak, would recommend Passy-Muir placement at rehab
facility. The patient was weaned off the ventilator once his new
tube was in place and currently at 600/20/40%/5. Patient should
be aggressively weaned from ventilator as tolerated.  Please
encourage out of bed and continue physical therapy (begun in
hospital).  He should receive humidified O2 while on trach
collar
.
2) Pneumonia. Likely lobar pneumonia rather than
post-obstructive (as indicated in notes from OSH) given absence
of obstruction noted on bronchoscopy. A 15-day course of broad
spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, metronidazole) was
completed.  OSH had recommended this duration given patient's
history of MRSA and VRE. Blood and sputum cultures were negative
at the time of discharge.
.
3) COPD. As above. The patient was continued on bronchodilator
therapy.
.
4) History of pulmonary embolus. No evidence of PE on CTA.
Patient has IVC filter in place and history of retroperitoneal
bleed and is therefore not anticoagulated.
.
5) Hypertension/Grade I CHF with Diastolic Dysfunction.
Metoprolol 50 mg was initiated after patient's respiratory
status stabilized.
.
6) Anemia. Patient's hematocrit ranged from 24-26 during
hospital stay.  Iron studies were sent but pending on discharge.
 Guaiac negative.  Although likely secondary to chronic disease,
please follow-up iron studies.

6) Diabetes. No record of medications for glycemic control.  Pt
was maintained on a  regular insulin sliding scale during his
hospital stay.
.
7) History of ureteral tear. Mild hematuria on urinalysis. The
patient was maintain with a foley catheter.  He may need
evaluation from urology in future.
.
8) Non SCLC stage IIIb.  According prior records, this has been
deemed unresectable and patient is on no treatments at this
time.  Please consider reopening discussion of lung cancer
treatment with his family.
.
Access: R IJ was removed and a left PICC line was inserted.
.
FEN: Patient had episode of clogged G-tube refractory to
flushing efforts, but an abdominal x-ray with gastrografin
contrast through G-tube showed contrast in stomach.
Subsequently, tube feeds were successful.  Please continue with
tube feeds.
.
Prophylaxis: Hep SQ, ppi, bowel regimen.
.
Code status: FULL, discussed with HCP.
