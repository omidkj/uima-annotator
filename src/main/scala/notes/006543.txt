CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient is transferred from an outside
hospital for cardiac catheterization following admission to
an Emergency Room complaining of dyspnea and chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 66-year-old woman with a
history of noninsulin-dependent diabetes and chronic anemia,
who has had three to four days of intermittent exertional
dyspnea and rest pain.  She presented to the Emergency Room
at [**Hospital3 3583**] on [**5-10**] with lateral ST depressions,
found to be in congestive heart failure.  Given sublingual
nitroglycerin, IV Lasix, and Lopressor, ruled in for a MI
with a troponin of 0.5, and transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for cardiac catheterization.  Please see the
catheterization report for full details.

In summary the catheterization on the day of admission showed
left main 20 percent, LAD 90 percent, left circumflex 90
percent, and RCA 90 percent.  The patient was then referred
to CT Surgery for coronary artery bypass grafting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Non-insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus.
2. Chronic anemia.


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1. Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
2. Status post left carpal tunnel release with a history of
   disk problems requiring surgery in the future.


MEDS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:
1. Aspirin 325 q.d.
2. Plavix 75 q.d.
3. Lopressor 75 b.i.d.
4. Lipitor 10 q.d.
5. Regular insulin-sliding scale.
6. Lovenox subcutaneously.
7. Metformin 500 mg b.i.d.


ALLERGIES:
1. Percocet, which causes anaphylaxis and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
   syndrome.
2. Tylenol causes a severe rash.


FAMILY HISTORY:  Unremarkable.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Denies cigarettes.  Denies EtOH.  Lives with
her husband.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  Lying in bed in no acute
distress.  HEENT:  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to
light.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Oropharynx is
benign with upper and lower dentures.  Neck is supple with no
lymphadenopathy.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate, and rhythm,
S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen is soft,
nontender with no masses, positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Bilaterally 2 plus pulses with no clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema.  Neurological:  Alert, oriented, and
nonfocal exam.

An echocardiogram done prior to surgery showed inferolateral
and basal hypokinesis with a global EF of 45 percent and no
AS.

On [**5-12**], the patient was brought to the operating room at
which time she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x3.
Please see the OR report for full details.  In summary, the
patient had a CABG x3 with a saphenous vein graft to the LAD,
saphenous vein graft to the distal RCA, and saphenous vein
graft to the OM.  Her bypass time was 69 minutes with a cross-
clamp time of 38 minutes.  She tolerated the operation well,
and was transferred from the operating room to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of transfer,
the patient had a mean arterial pressure of 75, CVP of 8,
heart rate of 100 beats per minute, sinus rhythm.  She was
transferred with Neo-Synephrine at 1.5 mcg/kg/minute and
propofol at 15 mcg/kg/minute.

Patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.  Her
anesthesia was reversed.  She was weaned from the ventilator
and successfully extubated.  She remained hemodynamically
stable, and her Neo-Synephrine drip was able to be weaned
from 1.5 mcg/kg/minute down to 0.2 mcg/kg/minute by morning
of postoperative day one.

On postoperative day one, the patient continued to be
hemodynamically stable.  Her Neo-Synephrine drip was weaned
to off.  She was begun on low-dose beta blockade.  Her chest
tubes were left in place as she had a fair amount of
drainage.

During the course of postoperative day one, the patient was
noted to have some atrial fibrillation.  She was therefore
begun on amiodarone infusion.  Additionally, the patient was
begun on IV Lasix.  Her chest tubes were discontinued.

By postoperative day three, the patient had converted to
normal sinus rhythm.  Amiodarone drip was changed to oral
dosing, and the patient was transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 121**] 2 for
continuing postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

Over the next several days, the patient continued to make
slow progress in her activity level while on the floor
despite the efforts of the nursing staff and Physical Therapy
staff.  She was also noted to have intermittent bouts of
diarrhea, which she attributed to her irritable bowel
syndrome, however, the patient was screened for Clostridium
difficile.  All three specimens returned negative.

Because of the patient's slow progress, it was decided to
check thyroid function levels, and it was found that her TSH
was undetectable with an elevated free T4 and  therefore
Endocrine was consulted.  The patient continued to be
followed with daily thyroid functions, free T4's and T3's,
which slowly resolved over the next several days.

On postoperative day 11, it was decided that the patient was
stable and ready to be discharged to home with followup by
Cardiac Surgery, and her primary endocrinologist and
cardiologist in [**Location (un) 3320**], [**State 350**].

At the time of this dictation, the patient's physical exam is
as follows:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.9, heart rate 61
sinus rhythm, blood pressure 130/60, respiratory rate 20, and
O2 saturation 95 percent on room air, weight preoperatively
57.2 kg, at discharge 55 kg.  Laboratory data:  White count
10.3, hematocrit 33, platelets 560, sodium 139, potassium
4.5, chloride 101, CO2 26, BUN 26, creatinine 1.2, glucose
72.  T4 and T3 pending on day of discharge.

On physical exam, is alert and oriented times three, moves
all extremities, and follows commands.  Respiratory:
Diminished at the bases, otherwise clear to auscultation.
Cardiac:  Regular, rate, and rhythm, S1, S2, sternum is
stable.  Incision with Steri-Strips, opened to air clean and
dry.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive
bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm and well perfused with no
edema.  Right saphenous vein graft harvest site with Steri-
Strips open to air clean and dry.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Furosemide 20 mg p.o. q.d. x10 days.
2. Potassium chloride 20 mEq q.d. x10 days.
3. Aspirin 325 q.d.
4. Amiodarone 200 q.d.
5. Metformin 500 b.i.d.
6. Atorvastatin 10 mg q.d.
7. Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d.
8. Captopril 12.5 mg t.i.d.
9. Flagyl 500 mg t.i.d. x10 days.
10.      Regular insulin-sliding scale.

The patient is to be discharged to home with VNA.  She is to
have followup in the [**Hospital 409**] Clinic in two weeks.  She is to
have followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5311**] in one week and follow up with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] in two weeks.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass
   grafting x3 with a saphenous vein graft to the left
   anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft to the
   distal right coronary artery, and saphenous vein graft to
   the obtuse margin.
2. Non-insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus.
3. Chronic anemia.
4. Status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
5.
   Status post left carpal tunnel release.
