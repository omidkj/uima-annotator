Admission Date:[**2162-10-29**]           DISCHARGE DATE [**2162-11-16**]


Date of Birth:   [**2101-10-15**]       Sex:  F

Service:  MED ICU

HISTORY:  Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 61-year-old woman with a past
medical history significant for nonHodgkin lymphoma of the
stomach diagnosed in [**2156**], status post resection chemotherapy
and XRT.  She initially presented to [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital
on [**10-8**] of this year with the chief complaint of two
to three weeks of cough with yellow-sputum production.  She
also complained of progressive dyspnea, sore throat, and
headache.  At the time of admission to [**Hospital3 417**] she was
hypoxic and afebrile with a white cell count of 17,000
including 52% bands and extensive bilateral infiltrates on
chest x-ray.

She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at [**Hospital3 417**]
Hospital and started on IV Levaquin and Ceftriaxone.  She was
intubated on [**10-10**].  Bronchoscopy was performed on
[**10-11**] and [**10-15**].  She was begun on IV Solu-Medrol 25 mg q.6h.
on [**10-16**] for presumptive BOOP (bronchiolitis
obliterans-organizing pneumonia).  She underwent wedge
resection of the right lower lobe on [**10-18**].
Pathology confirmed by [**Hospital6 1129**] as
"organizing fibrinous pneumonia, (question infectious).  The
patient had improvement in respiratory status, while at
[**Hospital 36047**] Hospital with progressively decreasing FIO2
requirements.  Hospital course at [**Hospital3 417**] was
completed by infection with [**Female First Name (un) 564**] and Pseudomonas in the
sputum and the development of a 6-cm area septation and
cavitation in the left upper lobe.  She was started on
Ceftazidime, Amikacin, and Diflucan after receiving a 17-day
course of Ceftriaxone and Levaquin.  She also had a prolonged
need for mechanical ventilation at [**Hospital3 417**] and arrived
at [**Hospital3 **] status post tracheostomy and peg-tube
placement on [**10-27**].  She also had some
liver-function test abnormalities and some question of
cardiac function.  She reportedly ruled out for a MI at [**Hospital3 418**].  The Swan-Ganz catheterization during the hospital
course at [**Hospital3 417**] revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure of 12 and transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal
biventricular function with 1 to 2+ tricuspid regurgitation.
She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 188**] for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Hyperlipidemia.
3.  Pernicious anemia.
4.  NonHodgkin gastric lymphoma (large and cleaved
follicular-cell type).  Status post trans-abdominal resection
of stomach and distal esophagus in [**2136**], status post
chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  Bone marrow biopsy was
negative for malignancy.
5.  Status post left shoulder prosthesis placement.
6.  Echocardiogram in [**2156**] reportedly showed left ventricular
hypertrophy with right ventricular hypertrophy and mitral
regurgitation.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Univasc 7.5 mg q.d.
2.  Prevacid 30 mg q.d.
3.  Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.
4.  Reglan 10 mg t.i.d.
5.  Potassium 40 mEq q.d.
6.  Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously b.i.d.
7.  Solu-Medrol 80 mg q.8h.
8.  Tube feeds.
9.  Ceftazidime 2 g IV q.8h.
10. Amikacin 750 mg IV q.24h.
11. Diflucan 400 mg IV q.24h.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married, born in [**Country 2784**].
She drinks alcohol socially.  She has a 45-year-history of
tobacco use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Weight 81 kg.
Temperature 98.9 degrees Fahrenheit.  Heart rate 59.  Blood
pressure 179/76.  Respiratory rate 16.  Oxygen saturation
95%.  Arterial blood gas 7.56/41/68 on mechanical ventilation
settings of SIMV at a rate of 6 with tidal volume of 800.
Pressure support 10.  PEEP of 5.  FIO2 45%.

GENERAL:  She was an obese intubated woman on a ventilator in
no apparent distress.  She opened her mouth on command.
HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  There were several
crusted erythematous lesions near the right angle of the
mouth.  The mucous membranes were moist.  Neck was supple.
There was a tracheostomy tube in placed.  A right IJ
triple-lumen catheter was also placed.  HEART:  The heart was
regular without evidence of murmur.  LUNGS:  Auscultation of
the lungs revealed rhonchorous transmitted upper airway
sounds, anteriorly, with expiratory wheezes bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended with
normoactive bowel sounds and no palpable masses.  A G-tube
was in place.  EXTREMITIES:  Extremities showed no evidence
of clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  There was a right radial
arterial line in place.  SKIN:  Examination of the skin was
notable for the crusted-erythematous lesions at the angle of
the right mouth.

LABORATORY DATA:  Data revealed the white cell count of 19.3;
hematocrit 30.6; platelets 234,000; sodium 137; potassium
3.7; chloride 96; bicarbonate 35; BUN 22 and creatinine 0.2;
glucose 164; ALT 70; AST 35; alkaline phosphatase 171; total
bilirubin 0.4; albumin 1.8; calcium 7.5; magnesium 1.4;
phosphate 3.

Microbiology tests done at [**Hospital **] Hospital revealed the
following:  negative tests for hepatitic C antibody,
hepatitis A, IgM hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis B
core IgM.  There was a positive Legionella urinary antigen
test.  Bronchoscopy washing from [**10-11**], showed
Aspergillus fumigatus.  Fungal culture of the right lower
lung tissue showed no growth to date at the time of admission
to [**Hospital3 **].  Numerous sputum cultures from [**Hospital3 417**]
Hospital were positive for [**Female First Name (un) 564**] albicans.

Chest CT, without contrast, perform on [**10-28**], showed
a 6-cm area of cavitation in the anterior left upper lung
likely secondary to fungal infection with septations and air,
but no fluid levels.  There was also bilateral air-space
disease with some sparing of the left lung base in the right
upper and middle lobes.  There was small-to-moderate effusion
on the left side, without evidence of pneumothorax.  There
was some subcutaneous emphysema on the right chest wall.

Lower extremity Dopplers were performed on [**10-9**] and
showed no evidence of DVT.  Right upper quadrant ultrasound
performed on [**10-9**] showed no acute pathology.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Pulmonary:   Ms. [**Known lastname **] remained on mechanical
ventilation throughout the duration of her hospital course.
The indication for mechanical ventilation was hypoxic
respiratory failure.  This was mainly due to thick, copious
secretions from her left upper lobe cavitary lesion.  At the
time of admission to [**Hospital3 **], the question was raised of
the diagnosis of BOOP, for which she had been started on
high-dose intravenous corticosteroids at [**Hospital3 417**]
Hospital.  Review of the pathology slides from her wedge
resection at [**Hospital3 417**] Hospital showed no evidence of
BOOP.  As a result, the intravenous corticosteroids were
gradually tapered and she is now off steroids.  She remained
on Ceftazidime, Amikacin, and Diflucan for several days after
admission cultures at that point ruled Klebsiella pneumonia
and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  At that time, her antibiotic
regimen was changed to Imipenem and Zosyn.

After several days on the combination of Imipenem and Zosyn,
the decision was made to change the antibiotic regimen to
Zosyn and Bactrim.  A day later the antibiotic regimen was
changed to Trinamm and Bactrim because of a possible drug
reaction to Zosyn.  The patient became acutely tachycardiac
and depressed with a drug-like rash on her torso.  She was
started on Bactrim on [**11-9**], and Triamm on [**11-10**].  Skin scrapings of the erythematous lesion around her
mouth, sone at the time of admission were positive for HSV-1.
She received a course of Acyclovir per the dermatology
recommendations.

She received treatment with appropriate antibiotics.  She
required less and less of a need for mechanical ventilation.
She was gradually weaned to pressure-support ventilation, and
on [**11-14**], she successfully tolerated a four-hour,
tracheostomy-collar trial.  At the same time she began
tolerating trials with a Passy-Muir valve, which she
