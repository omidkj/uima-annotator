diplopia, incoordination, vertigo, numbness/tingling, dysarthria
or dysphagia. She has no neck pain or back pain. In the ED, she

and labetalol 10mg IV at 21:28pm and 21:45 for HTN up
to systolic bp 220's, as well as hydralazine 10mg IV at 22:00pm.

Tests
TEE [**2140-6-14**]: trivial MR, trivial TR. No ASD/PFO. Normal EF. No
aortic atheroma.

Imaging
NCHCT [**2140-7-10**]: Multifocal hypoattenuating regions, bilaterally,
in a non- arterial distribution, much of which is consistent
with vasogenic edema. With considerations of cerebral venous
thrombosis, vasculitis, PRES, toxic (including drug effect) and
infection, including viral (particularly, HSV) or septic emboli,
gadolinium-enhanced MRI, with cerebral MRA and MRV, was
recommended for further characterization and has been obtained.

CXR [**2140-7-10**]: No, evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.

CTA Head/Neck [**2140-7-11**]: 1. Evidence of large vessel disease in the
neck, with moderate stenoses of the left subclavian artery
proximal to the vertebral origin, and of the left internal
carotid artery just distal to its origin.
2. No definite evidence of small vessel disease, although
evaluation of the intracranial vessels is limited by suboptimal
technique. If further evaluation of the intracranial vessels is
needed, cerebral angiogra
