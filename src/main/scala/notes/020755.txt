Reports:
[**2129-8-4**] Cardiology ECG Ventricular paced rhythm
Since previous tracing of [**2128-2-16**], 100% paced rhythm at 60bpm

[**2129-8-4**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP)   IMPRESSION: Reduced
right pleural effusion. No acute abnormality.

[**2129-8-4**] Radiology ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)   IMPRESSION:
1. Pacing device in the left upper quadrant, which probably
corresponds to the palpable subcutaneous foreign body.
2. Cholelithiasis.
3. Right pleural effusion.

[**2129-8-4**] Radiology LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US CONCLUSION:
1.Cholelithiasis.
2.Moderately distended sludge filled gallbladder with gallstones
with suggestion of gallbladder wall edema. In the appropriate
clinical setting, this appearance could represent acute
cholecystitis. Clinical correlation advised. If clinically
required, a HIDA scan could help clarify.

[**2129-8-4**] Radiology CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT   IMPRESSION:
1. Satisfactory placement of right internal jugular line.
2. No pneumothorax.

[**2129-8-4**] Radiology RENAL U.S. IMPRESSION: No evidence of
hydronephrosis bilaterally.

Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo m with h/o cad, diastolic HF, who p/w 3 wk h/o
post-prandial RUQ pain, confusion.

Hypotension: felt to likely be [**1-26**] hypovolemia given history of
aggressive diuresis and exam findings consistent with
dehydration. Outpt bp's noted to be 80-110 systolic.  No evid of
cardiogenic shock. Admitted to MICU with MUST protocol, though
there was no evidence of sepsis. Held diuretics, beta blocker,
dig. Cultures remained without growth. BP improved quickly with
rehydration. Was given stress dose steroids as had been on 10mg
[**Hospital1 **] prednisone on admit for gout. Starting prednisone taper on
discharge, taper to off. If gout flares, could do local
injection, avoid NSAIDs given renal failure.
.
ARF on chronic renal failure: likely prerenal from dehydration.
Resolved rapidly with hydration. Urine lytes/osms consistent
with prerenal state. No evid of hydronephrosis on renal u/s.
Renally dosed meds, checked dig level which was not
supratherapeutic, though stopped this medication in favor of
beta blockade for rate control once indicated (has not had need
for beta blockade yet as still paced at 60bpm on discharge).
.
RUQ pain: presentation was concerning for cholecystitis, and
though he did have stones in his GB there was no indication on
imaging that he had cholecystitis.  Felt that he may have had a
mild gallstone pancreatitis given his transient pancreatic
enzyme elevation, possibly from a passing gallstone.  There was
no evidence of ischemic bowel (neg thumbprinting on KUB, no h/o
BRB, benign abdomen). His abd exam improved and remained benign
throughout the rest of his stay. He was on levo/flagyl for
coverage of possible cholecystitis, though this was d/c'd on
Day#5, the day of his discharge, as he had no indication for
antibiotics.
.
Hyponatremia: felt to be hypovolemic in origin, resolved quickly
with IVF; was on HCTZ, this was
