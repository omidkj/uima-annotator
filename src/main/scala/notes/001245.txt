None

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 76 year old woman of unknown handedness who was

CT head [**5-23**]:IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of an area of
increased attenuation in the left basal ganglia consistent with
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, with slight shift of normally
midline structures to the contralateral side and mass effect on
the left lateral ventricle.

CT head [**5-24**]:Again seen is evidence of intraparenchymal
hemorrhage in the left putamen, measuring just slightly larger
compared to prior study, however, not appearing significantly
changed. No significant change in mass effect on left lateral
ventricle or slight rightward shift. No new areas of hemorrhage
identified.
-------
CXR [**5-25**]
1. New pulmonary edema.
2. Left lower lobe consolidation/atelectasis with small left
pleural effusion.
3. Dislocation of the left shoulder.

TTE:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal.  The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic  function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue
velocity imaging E/e' is elevated (>15)  suggesting increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve  leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a
minimally increased gradient  consistent with minimal aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is  seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The left ventricular
inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are  mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.  There is a small pericardial
effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of  tamponade.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Left putaminal hemorrhage: Her exam stayed fairly stable
thoroughout her course, except that her mental status improved
significantly.  Her ICH was stable on repeat neuroimaging, with
no significant mass effect.  It was measured as roughly 2x1.3 cm
and appeared to originate in the left putamen.  There was no
intraventricular spread.  The location was very typical for
hypertensive hemorrhage, and her admission blood pressure was
extremely elevated.  She does not regularly seek medical care so
she may be chronically experiencing uncontrolled hypertension.
She had a repeat CT 24 hours after admission which showed a
stable bleed and amount of edema.  Her BP was treated initially
with a nicardipine drip.  This was quickly weaned and she was
treated with IV hydralazine.  This was transitioned to oral
hydralazine and captopril with aggressive titration.  She had
received a dose of labetalol at the OSH and presented extremely
bradycardic in the high 30s.  This was a sinus bradycardia.  It
was either due to her hypertension(no evidence of high ICP to
suggest [**Location (un) 3484**] repsonse) or to the beta blockade.  We decided
not to use further beta blockers given this response.  The
bradycardia resolved on day 1 of her stay.

She continued to have right arm weakness, but started to regain
some use of her right leg.  Her speech was extremely dysarthric,
but she was able to tell us her name and other short answers,
but did not speak fluently.  She was following  commands.

2.Pulmonary: She was initially intubated for airway protection.
She was quickly weaned from the ventilator and extubated.  She
later developed pulmonary edema on chest X-ray.  She was given
several doses of lasix during her stay and responded well.  As
she has possibly long standing HTN and an enlarged heart on CXR,
she likely has some element of CHF.  An echo was performed and
demonstrated a normal ejection fraction, but evidence of
diastolic dysfunction.

3.Cardiac: As above, she had BP controlled with a goal SBP of
less than 150 given her bleed.  This was achieved as above
without problems.  [**Name (NI) 227**] her probable CHF and bradycardia with
labetalol, she was put on an ACE-I with good tolerance. She was
found to have diastolic dysfunction as discussed above.

4.Ortho: The patient was found to have a dislocated left
shoulder on CXR.  The ortho service felt this was likely chronic
given lack of pain and good ROM, and no operative management was
recommended.

5.GI: She had a post-pyloric feeding tube placed and tolerated
tube feeds well.  She refused placement of a PEG tube.  A repeat
speech and swallow evaluation, including videoswallow
evaluation. Final recommendations were:

1. Remain NPO at this time, with NG tube in place for nutrition,
hydration & meds.
2. Speech therapy at rehab for:
  a. aphasia remediation
  b. Po trials of purees (no more than [**2-21**] oz) with deep
pressure to tongue to trigger repeat swallows.
