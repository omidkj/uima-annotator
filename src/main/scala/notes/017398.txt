History of Present Illness:
52 yo M with diffuse large B cell lymphoma s/p allo stem cell
transplant [**6-/2160**], h/o diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, admitted for
fever, cough, and BRBPR, now being transferred from BMT to ICU
for hypoxic respiratory distress.
.
Based on the admission note, patient has been having fatigue and
productive cough with white sputum x 4 days as well as fever up
to 100.8.  There has been wheeze and dyspnea on exertion, which
are not relieved by Flovent or Proair.  There is also myalgia
for 1 day with R> L sinus tenderness.  Per report, no sore
throat, post-nasal drip, pleuritis, orthopnea, or PND.
.
Of note, on day of admission, patient had BRBPR on toilet paper
and then frank blood in the toilet bowl.  This is associated
with mild, crampy abdominal pain.  Had history of BRBPR but none
recently.  Stool had been yellowish-brown.  Had been having
diarrhea since starting antibiotics (7 days) for his left hand
cellulitis.  He was seen in clinic on day of admission with
tachycardia HR 116, T 98.3, BP 129/71 and Hct 29.2 (down from
33.8 on [**6-17**]) WBC 11.7 with 67% PMN, Creatinine 1.4 (baseline
1.4-1.5). Blood cultures, stool cultures were obtained and
patient was given 2L IVNS. Repeat HCT was 27.6.
.
On arrival to the floor, vitals were t:98.9 bp:150/97 p:113
rr:22 SaO295% RA. He complained of ongoing cough and wheezing
and moderate dyspnea on exertion though breathing was
comfortable at rest.  He was started on antibiotics-
azithromycin and ceftriaxone.
.
At around 11PM, patient was triggerred for increased SOB
requiring more oxygen supplement, O2 Sat 84% on RA improved to
low 90% on 4L which then improved to mid 90% on NRB.  He
received lasix 40 mg IV, nebs, and Solumedrol 40 IV x1.  At
around midnight, patient got up to the bathroom.  He was noted
to have borderline temp at 100.3, BP 148/94, HR 120, RR 20.  As
he was returning from the bathroom, he felt more SOB with O2Sat
down to 70% on RA which improved to 96% on NRB.  Then 50 % on
NRB.  Code blue was called.  Patient was intubated given his
respiratory distress and underwent femoral vein catheterization.
 Subsequently, he underwent CTA to rule out for PE.  A couple
messages were left for patient's wife for her to call back for
updates.

of [**2160**] with excellent response to treatment
- [**2160-6-2**] matched unrelated allogeneic transplant on the
ATG/TLI/clofarabine study, cohort 4. Day 0 on [**2160-6-13**].
- [**2160-7-14**] CMV positive started on Valcyte
- [**2160-11-26**] changed valcyte to acyclovir due to concern for
affects on blood counts
- [**12/2160**] month restaging PET scan showed no evidence for
lymphoma.
- [**2161-6-10**] left hand cellulitis at the site of thorn stick on #4
digit, treated with 7 days of linezolid
