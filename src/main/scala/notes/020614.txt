History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 88 year-old male with a PMHx significant for
aortic stenosis (peak/mean gradient 60/32 mm HG in [**2162-8-8**]),
CHF with EF 35% in [**2162-8-8**], chronic atrial fibrillation on
Coumadin therapy, DM type 2, hypertension and MDS with anemia

Aldactone D/C'd, Quinine D/C'd.

Per NH notes, patient noted to have increasing pulmonary
crackles 3 days PTA and was given an additional 80 mg PO of
Lasix. Worsening pulmonary crackles were noted this AM, and
patient received an additional Lasix 40 mg IV X 1 in addition to
usual 80 mg PO. 4 lbs weight gain noted over weekend. Vitals BP

CBC:
WBC 5.8, Hct 37.5 (was 27.9 on [**1-5**]), plt 9 (14 on [**1-5**]). Ne#
84%, Ly 6%. No bands.

Chemistry:
Na 137, K 4.8, Cl 96, HCO3 27 (AG 14), BUN 35, Creat 1.4 (was
1.2 on [**1-5**]), glucose 153.

Cardiac enzymes:
CK 35
Trop 0.15 (was 0.08 on [**2162-8-9**])

EKG: Atrial fibrillation, rate . LAD. No acute ischemic changes
versus 12/[**2162**].

CXR PA AND LATERAL [**2163-1-17**]: Comparison made to prior study of
[**2162-12-29**]. There is moderate cardiomegaly. The appearance of
the right lung is unchanged, with right lower lobe costophrenic
angle pleural thickening and faint lower lobe linear opacities.
There is no evidence of congestive heart failure. No new
opacities are present.
IMPRESSION: Stable changes in the right lower lobe. No acute
infiltrates and no evidence of congestive heart failure.

Relevant studies in hospital:
CXR [**2163-1-19**]: Again note is made of marked biventricular
enlargement. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged
compared to the prior history. Again note is made of right-sided
effusion, unchanged compared to the prior study. Note is made of
mild congestive heart failure. Note is made of patchy opacity in
the right lower lobe, which may represent atelectasis versus
pneumonia. No pneumothorax is noted.

IMPRESSION:
Cardiomegaly, mild CHF, and small right pleural effusion.
Opacity in the right lower lobe, representing atelectasis versus
pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
89 year-old male with multiple medical problems including CHF
with EF 35%, severe AS, severe MDS with thrombocytopenia,
chronic atrial fibrillation on Coumadin on admission, HTN and DM
type 2, admitted with weight gain and increasing pulmonary rale,
as well as severe thrombocytopenia. His hospital course will be
reviewed by problems.

1) CHF: Patient with known CHF with an EF of 35% in [**2162-8-8**],
likely as a complication of HTN and severe AS. He is chronically
fluid overloaded with a tenuous intravascular volume status in
the setting of AS, and aggressive diuresis in the past has
resulted in dehydration and ARF. On admission, he was felt to be
likely in mild CHF, and was given Lasix 40 mg IV X 1 in ED. On
the floor, he was continued on Lasix 40 mg PO BID, with fair
diuresis and slow improvement in his respiratory status. Lasix
was temporarily held in the setting of low BP and likely GI
bleed (see below) but resumed on [**2163-1-19**] and titrated to TID
dosing. His weight at discharge is 182 lbs. He will need daily
weights and careful monitoring of his fluid balance, with extra
Lasix as needed for >= 3 lbs weight gain as BP tolerates.

2) Wheezing: Patient had significant wheezing in hospital, felt
likely cardiac asthma, treated with standing Albuterol and
Atrovent nebulizers. Despite bronchodilator therapy and
diuresis, he continued to have wheezing and SOB, but saturation
stable on room air. Repeat CXRs were suggestive of mild CHF, no
clear infiltrate. Nonetheless, given his slow improvement and
airway secretions, he was started on empiric Levofloxacin on
[**2163-1-22**] to complete 7 days.

3) GI bleed: On admission, platelet count was 9K. Patient was
given 1 bag of platelets and Coumadin therapy was held. On
[**2163-1-18**], however, Hct 33--> 24 in the setting of severe
thrombocytopenia and INR 1.9, and patient noted to have 1
episode of melena. His SBP also dropped to 80s. MICU and GI team
were both called, and the patient was administered blood
products to keep Hct>30, Plt>25 and INR<=1.5. He received a
total of 3 units of PRBCs, 5 bags of platelets (including one on
admission) and 1 unit of FFP, with an appropriate response in
his counts. He was transferred to the ICU for close observation
and possible EGD. He was also started on Protonix IV BID. While
in ICU, patient remained hemodynamically stable, without need
for further blood products. Given HD stability and stable blood
counts, EGD was deferred and Mr. [**Known lastname **] was transferred back to
floor on [**2163-1-19**]. He had 1 further episode of melena in the
ICU, none on the floor. Hct 37.1 at discharge, platelets 21K,
INR 1.6. He received 1 of 3 doses of vitamin K and will continue
on Protonix PO BID with GI follow-up. He will need daily count
checks.

4) CAD/AS: Patient followed at an OSH for h/o CAD. On admission,
patient had mild troponin elevation, felt likely troponin leak
in the setting of CHF, RF. Peak troponin 0.17, trending down at
discharge. EKG was without acute ischemic changes. While in
hospital, Imdur was D/C'd given his severe AS, and he was
started on low-dose Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID. Of note, no ASA
given thrombocytopenia. According to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 141**], patient
deemed a poo
