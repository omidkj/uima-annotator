Pertinent Results:
[**3-3**] Echo: PRE-CPB: The left atrium is mildly dilated. No
thrombus is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. No
thoracic aortic dissection is seen. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
prosthesis is present. There is severe aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. POST-CPB: A
mechanical bileaflet valve is seen in the aortic position. The
valve is well seated with normal leaflet motion. The normal
washing jets are seen. There is no paravalvular leak. The peak
gradient across the aortic valve is 27mmHg, the mean gradient is
14mmHg with a cardiac output of 6. The LV systolic function
remains moderately impaired, the estimated EF is 35-40%.
Hypokinesis is most notable in the anteroseptal wall. There is
no evidence of aortic dissection.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 5890**] was a same day admit after undergoing pre-operative
work-up prior to admission. On [**3-3**] he was brought to the
operating room where he underwent a  Re-do aortic valve
replacement with 21- mm Regent St. [**Hospital 923**] Medical mechanical valve
. Please see operative report for surgical details. Following
surgery he was transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring
in stable condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from
sedation, awoke neurologically intact and extubated. All
pressors weaned off. Beta-blocker/Statin/Aspirin and diuresis
were initiated. All lines and drains were discontinued per
protocol. He was transferred to the step down unit for further
monitoring. Physical Therapy was consulted to evaluate strength
and mobility. The remainder of his hospital course was
essentially uneventful. Anticoagulation was intitiated with
Coumadin and a Heparin bridge. On POD# 6 his INR was therapeutic
and Mr.[**Known lastname 5890**] was cleared for discharge to home with VNA. All
Follow up appointments were advised.
