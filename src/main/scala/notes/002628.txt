HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82-year-old female
with multiple medical issues including chronic renal failure,
coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, congestive
heart failure, congestive obstructive pulmonary disease,
hypertension, gout, who is transferred from an outside
hospital for hypoxia and shortness of breath, and oxygen
requirement above her baseline.  She was also transferred for
a surgical evaluation for severe pain in her lower
extremities.

At the outside hospital, she was diuresed with Natrecor and
Bumex and ruled out for a myocardial infarction.  However,
her oxygen requirement remained despite improvement in her
jugular venous distention and chest x-ray.  While at the
outside hospital, she was noted to have a left ankle
effusion, and this was catheterized.  Ultimately, she was
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further evaluation.

On admission, the patient complained of bilateral ankle and
feet pain enabling, her pain so severe she was unable to
walk.  On admission, she denied chest pain, shortness of
breath, fever, chills, palpitations, lightheadedness, or
dizziness.  She did notice a cough with occasional sputum
production.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Atrial fibrillation status post pacemaker [**2172-12-24**].
2. Chronic renal failure baseline of [**3-2**].0.
3. Coronary artery disease angioplasty in [**2172-9-29**]
status post two stents, silent myocardial infarction in [**2167**].
4. Congestive heart failure.  Echocardiogram on [**2172-10-29**] showed ejection fraction of 50%, [**3-2**]+ mitral
regurgitation, and [**3-2**]+ tricuspid regurgitation.
5. Congestive obstructive pulmonary disease.
6. Hypothyroid.
7. Chronic anemia secondary to chronic renal failure.
8. Hypertension.
9. Gout.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1. Coumadin 2 mg po q day.
2. Epogen 8,000 units q Tuesday.
3. Synthroid 25 mcg q day on empty stomach.
4. Calcium 1,000 mg tid.
5. Digoxin 0.125 q Thursday.
6. Lopressor 25 [**Hospital1 **].
7. Norvasc 5 mg q day.
8. Protonix 40 q day.
9. Sovilamil 800 mg tid.
10. Floredil.
11. Seroquel.
12. Nitropatch.
13. Colace.
14. Albuterol nebulizers.
15. Atrovent nebulizers.
16. Amiodarone.
17. Imdur.
18. Prednisone taper.
19. Bumex.
20. Home O2.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 96.4, blood pressure
112/62, heart rate 50, respiratory rate 18, SPO2 95%  on 4
liters.  In general, the patient appeared in no acute
distress.  HEENT:  Anicteric sclerae.  Moist oropharynx.
Neck:  No bruits.  Of note, a murmur at the left carotid, no
lymphadenopathy, no jugular venous pressure appreciable.
Cardiovascular:  Normal S1, S2 with a [**3-4**] crescendo
holosystolic murmur heard best at the left upper sternal
border.  Pulmonary:  Bibasilar crackles left greater than
right.  Abdomen:  Bowel sounds positive, soft, tender to deep
palpation in the right upper quadrant.  Extremities cool,
left worse than right.  Very tender to palpation and 1+ edema
at the ankles.  Neurologic:  Bilateral lower extremity muscle
atrophy noted.

Electrocardiogram on admission showed a left bundle branch
paced without ischemic changes.

Admission laboratories are significant for a creatinine of
4.6, bicarb 18.

Chest x-ray on admission showed pacemaker device in place.
Also of note, is a small area of hazy ill defined focal
density in the right lower lung zone that could represent
atelectasis and/or aspiration.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was evaluated by Vascular for
severe peripheral vascular disease.  Cardiology was also
consulted for possibility of surgery.  She was treated with
antibiotics for the pneumonia.  The day after admission the
patient progressively got worse requiring increased oxygen
and having complaints of shortness of breath.  She was
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit.

She was placed on pressors to maintain her blood pressure and
was intubated to aid ventilation and oxygenation.  She was
also started with empiric treatment of Heparin for
possibility of a pulmonary embolus.  Throughout the course of
the stay in the unit, she developed shock and multisystem
organ failure including renal cardiac, and respiratory.
Given the higher risk of mortality despite aggressive care,
family decided patient to become comfort measures only.
Pressors were removed, and patient passed away on [**2173-1-23**].
