History of Present Illness:
72-year-old woman who has a history of mild

(C4-C7).  The patient is unable to recall the majority of her
past medical history.  She now presents with progressive urinary
incontinence and fecal incontinence.  Urinary incontinence was
noticed for at least a year.  Fecal incontinence seems to be
present for about 3-4 weeks only.  The patient has, in addition,
felt a decrease in her ability to walk but is mobile with a
walker.  She complains about bilateral lower extremity
paresthesias, left greater than right.  She has intermittent
bilateral upper extremity numbness.  She also complains about
progressive right-sided thigh pain when she is going down the
stairs.    She walks with a
walker.  The patient takes home medications including
hydrochlorothiazide, Protonix, Fosamax, and naproxen.  She is
not
known to have any drug allergies.  She is a nonsmoker,
nondrinker.


Past Medical History:
The patient has a past medical history that is relevant
for hypertension, GERD, osteoporosis.  Surgical history remains
relevant for a distant left frontal meningioma resection, status
post ACDF C4-C7 in [**2107**] and a right-sided THR.

Social History:
The patient takes home medications including
hydrochlorothiazide, Protonix, Fosamax, and naproxen.  She is
not
known to have any drug allergies.  She is a nonsmoker,
nondrinker.

Physical Exam:
Physical examination reveals that she is awake and alert and
interactive.  She is slightly retarded and slow, but pleasantly
interactive.  She walks into the office with a walker.  She has
an obvious kyphosis, but is more mobile with a walker and shows
no signs of imbalance.  The cranial nerves are remarkable for a
prominent right-sided exotropia at rest.  Bilateral pupils are
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements are
full despite disconjugate gaze.  There is no nystagmus.  She has
good visual fields.  Facial strength and sensation are normal.
Hearing is intact.  Tongue is midline and shows no signs of
atrophy of fasciculation.  Motor exam is somewhat limited but
shows mild to moderate wasting of hand intrinsic muscles as well
as thenar.  Tone is increased in both legs with signs of
spasticity.  She has weakness in the distal upper extremity
approximately [**5-2**] bilaterally.  She has good strength
approximately bilaterally except the right-sided deltoid.  She
has bilateral lower extremity weakness 4/5 with more prominent
weakness in the toe bilaterally.  Fine motor control is not
testable.  She has no drift.  Sensory exam reveals no obvious
deficits bilaterally.  She complains about dysesthesias in a
nonradicular pattern.  Symmetric reflexes were elicited.  She
has
bilateral upgoing toes.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted and brought to the OR electively where under
general anesthesia she underwent posterior cervical laminectomy
and lumbar decompressive laminectomy.  Intra-op toward end of
the case she had some labile HR and BP became pressure
dependent.  She was transferred to the PACU and seen in
consultation with cardiology who recommended EKG, echo in
several days (not emergent)and to replete lytes and follow hct.
She was weaned off the vent on post op day #1, she was
hemodynamically stable.  She had hemovacs which were placed
intraop which were patent and draining - she remained on
prophylactic antibxs while these were in.  The drains were
removed on [**6-17**] without difficulty.  She had 1 unit PRBC on [**6-16**]
for hct of 24.  This came up to 28 post transfusion.  Hct was 26
on [**6-19**] and a second PRBC was given.  Her incisions were clean
dry and intact with sutures.  Her activity and diet were
increased.  She was tacycardic post op which was treated
initially with fluid boluses but continued and she was started
on lopressor which was gradually increased.  Medicine followed
her throughout her hospitalization.  She had CXR on [**6-18**] which
showed LLL pneumonia and levoflox was started. She also had
chest CTA on [**6-19**] to r/o PE for her continued tachycardia.  She
was evaluated by PT/OT and needs acute rehab stay once medically
cleared. She did have an episode of desaturation to the mid 80's
that was relieved with iv lasix. Cardiology recommended close
electrolyte monitoring to keep her potassium above 4.0. They
thought her tachyarrhhythmia was likely an atrial tachycardia
and that it would likely resolve over time as the patient
recovers from her operation.
Her primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended transfer to
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] where she will be available to manage the
patient's remaining medical issues. The patient was discharged
to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on POD6 in stable condition and will be
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and will follow up in clinic with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **].
