History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 yo f w/ h/o DM2, living unrelated kidney
transplant [**2106**], pvd s/p several toe amputations, CAD s/p CABG,
dCHF, HTN, hyperlipidemia, obesity, OSA, current tobacco abuse,
presumed COPD with home O2 requirement, a fib s/p ablation, h/o
DVT on coumadin who was admitted [**2110-5-1**] to OSH with SOB. O2 sat
in ED 89% unclear if this was on any O2. She also had leg
swelling, no CP or cough. CXR on admission showed moderate CHF,
BNP 8500.
.
Review of OSH records show that she was admitted there from
[**Date range (1) 29151**] for SOB, CHF treated with Lasix gtt. During this
admission, she also had a flutter and an ablation. Admission
[**Date range (1) 29152**] for AMS thought [**1-7**] proteus UTI treated with
ertapenem and ARF to high 1's from baseline 1.2. Admission
[**Date range (1) 29153**] for AMS [**1-7**] E coli UTI treated with bactrim, ARF,
hyponatremia, CHF diuresed on lasix gtt, noted R pleural
effusion.
.
Of note the records of this 10 day hospitalization at the OSH
are remarkable for lack of completeness. Cr there trended
nadired at 1.7 on [**5-6**]-2 and then slowly rose to 2.3 on [**5-11**] when
pt was transferred. Of note, admission wt there [**5-2**] was 130.3
kg and weights there seem to have varied wildly but trended to
124.6 on [**5-11**]. She was also treated with a 10 day course of
ceftriaxone and bactrim ending [**5-10**] for presumably UTI. Pt was on
Bumex for 1 day ending [**2110-5-2**]. Was also on lasix gtt from
admission until [**2110-5-9**]. Pt recieved 1 dose metolazone [**5-4**]. Of
note, the pt states she has had 5 admissions this year with 1 at
[**Hospital3 5365**] where a stent was placed about 1 mo ago. States
most admissions for fluid overload and 4 with UTI.
.
Pulm c/s at [**Hospital6 33**] [**2110-5-6**] states pt was on ativan
for agitation;  pt confirms high anxiety treated with this
medication. Pt had been afebrile for entire hospital course up
to that time, O2 sats were 94% on 5L O2, WBC 6, hct 27.9, plt
168K. She was noted to be excessively sleepy that day while
talking to the consultant. They recommended continued diuresis
and stated she had lost significant weight on lasix gtt. Inpt
sleep study was ordered at that time (records could not be
located at this time at OSH) and she was placed on empiric bipap
with O2. CT chest was also recommended (although records of this
could not be found o/n).
Renal was consulted on admission as was cardiology. She was
ruled out for an MI. Of note, in cards consultation, she stated
she had a stent 1 mo ago but cards could not find records of
this (likely b/c per pt this was at [**Hospital3 5365**]).
.
On arrival to the floor, pt states she is depressed, scared and
afraid to go to sleep. States she often needs ativan for her
anxiety in house. She denies any pain. She states she was put on
bipap at OSH but woke up in a panic with a sore throat from
this. Also c/o epistaxis at OSH. Does c/o SOB. Pt states she
does not recall all events from the OSH as she is often delerius
in the hospital. c/o morning nausea and headache at OSH. C/o
constipation.
.
ROS: Denies fever, chills, cough, chest pain, abdominal pain,
vomiting, diarrhea, BRBPR, melena, dysuria, hematuria.
