History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 73649**] was a 66 year old male with h/o CAD s/p CABG
(atatomy not known) as well as PCI with stent in [**12/2167**] in [**Location (un) 7349**]
who was in his USOH until 4 pm on [**7-22**] when the patient
collapsed after lifting heavy boxes. By report, CPR was
initiated immediately and 911 called with rapid EMS response.
Per report, EMS found pt in WCT likely VT and pulseless. Pt
received a total of 9 shocks and lidocaine push during the
transport to OSH ED. On arrival in the ED the patient was
unreponsive and without a pulse, s/p two more shocks and
intubated for airway protection. EKG with WCT and he was given
amio bolus x 2 and started on a drip. The patient also was given
epi and atropine during the code. The patient remained
hypotensive and was started on dopamine/levophed for pressure
support. The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for ongoing
care. Echo at OSH by report demonstrated an EF of 40% with
global hypokinesis, no focal wall motion abnormalities, but was
a limited study. CT of the head showed no acute changes. Meds on
transfer included amio gtt and plavix.

Past Medical History:
- CABG [**76**] yrs ago, ANATOMY: LIMA to LAD, SVG to High Lateral
- PCI [**2167-12-2**] w/two DES to mid and distal RCA

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2168-7-23**] 11:10 AM
TWO PORTABLE VIEWS. Comparison with the previous study done
earlier the same day. There is streaky density at the lung bases
consistent with subsegmental atelectasis as before. The patient
is status post median sternotomy and CABG. Mediastinal
structures are unchanged. An endotracheal tube and nasogastric
tube remain in place.
IMPRESSION: Subsegmental atelectasis.
.
PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST 7:56 A.M. [**8-3**]
Compared with [**2168-8-2**] at 10:44 p.m., no obvious interval change
in the pulmonary vascular engorgement centrally.
The patchy streaky opacities at the right lung base are slightly
more prominent and confluent suggesting pneumonia.
.
Cardiology Report ECG	Study Date of [**2168-7-23**]  1:59:54 AM

Sinus rhythm, rate 76. Technical artifacts are seen. An
indeterminate axis is
noted. Right bundle-branch block pattern is seen. Ther is likely
an
anteroseptal myocardial infarction of undetermined age. No
previous tracing
available for comparison.
