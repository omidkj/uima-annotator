History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 1557**] is a 75 yo female with h/o HTN, DM, CAD, CHF, breast
cancer, and chronic kidney disease, who presents with one
episode of BRBPR at home with a bowel movement. She states that
she has been constipated without a bowel movement for 2 weeks,
and began taking "sugar candy" which she states helps her move
her bowels. She states that she started having bowel movements
without problem, until 3 am on the morning of admission. At that
point, she had crampy abdominal pain, that was relieved with a
bowel movement, which she noticed had blood in it. She states
that she felt weak after having this bowel movement and sat on
the toilet for a while. She returned to bed eventually, and had
another bowel movement with blood in the stool later that
morning. At this point, she came to the ED.
.
On ROS, the patient denies previous h/o BRBPR, bleeding
disorders, CP, PND, syncope. She reports feeling lightheaded and
week, and states that she has a h/o dark stools (which she
believes is [**1-10**] iron pills), h/o bleeding gums with brushing
teeth, and previous history of epistaxis (now s/p cautery). She
also reports SOB, and orthopnea, now improved.
.
Her most recent colonoscopy/EGD was in [**2159**], and was normal.
.
In the ED, her VS were stable at 98.6, 81, 159/79, 16, 100%RA.
She was found to have BRBPR on rectal exam. While in the ED she
had another episode of BRPBR and was found at that time to have
a hematocrit of 37.9.

[**5-10**]:
CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear without
nodule, opacity or effusion. The heart is grossly normal in
appearance without pericardial effusion.

Limited evaluation of the intraabdominal organs can be made
given lack of contrast administration. However, no abnormality
is detected within the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, or
adrenal glands. Multiple cystic lesions are identified in the
kidneys bilaterally including a hyperdense cyst within the lower
pole of the left kidney measuring 1.2 cm in diameter and a right
interpolar region hyperdense cyst measuring 3.2 cm in diameter.
These cysts are unchanged aside from a slight increase in size
of an exophytic hemorragic cyst within the right interpolar
region.

There is no free fluid or free air present within the abdomen.
No pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal
lymphadenopathy identified.

CT PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: Wall thickening and submucosal edema
with surrounding fat strandings identified within a long segment
of the colon including the entire descending and majority of
transverse colon. There is sigmoid diverticulosis without
evidence of diverticulitis. Atherosclerotic changes within the
descending abdominal aorta without aneurysmal dilatation. The
rectum, bladder and distal ureters are visualized and
unremarkable.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are
identified within the osseous structures.

IMPRESSION:
1. Wall thickening with submucosal edema vs hemmorage and
surrounding fat stranding within a long segment of the
transverse and descending colon consistent with colitis with
ischemic etiology less likely.
2. Multiple simple and hyperdense renal cysts in the kidneys
bilaterally, generally unchanged in appearance since MRI, [**4-20**], [**2163**] aside from a slight increase in a previously
characterized hemmoragic cyst within the right interpolar
region.
3. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.

Chest radiographs:
PA and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate mild
cardiomegaly, unchanged when compared to multiple previous
examinations. Right upper lung volume loss also remains
unchanged. Remodeling of the posterior right third rib is
similar in appearance. Biapical pleural thickening is unchanged.
Increased opacity projecting over the right upper lung is more
conspicuous than seen on [**2166-2-4**]. The costophrenic angles are
sharp. No pneumothorax. Appearance of the right lateral fourth
and fifth ribs is unchanged.

IMPRESSION:

Right upper lung volume loss and biapical pleural thickening,
unchanged.

Increased opacity projecting over the right upper lung, seen on
the PA view only. The finding may represent summation of soft
tissue structures, but a pulmonary opacity is not excluded.
Assessment with routine CT examination of the chest is
recommended for more specific evauation.

Tagged RBC scan:
NTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous red
blood cells
labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic images of the
abdomen for minutes
were obtained.

Blood flow images show no abnormality.

Dynamic blood pool images show no active GI bleeding.

IMPRESSION:
No active bleeding source identified after 90 minutes of
scanning.

[**2166-5-13**]:
FINDINGS:
There is no evidence of acute fracture or dislocation. There is
diffuse bony osteopenia. The ankle mortise is intact, and the
joint spaces appear well preserved. Minimal plantar calcaneal
spurring is identified. Small well- corticated osseous fragments
are noted just distal to the lateral malleolus, likely
degenerative.

IMPRESSION:
No evidence of acute fracture or dislocation. Diffuse
osteopenia. Please note, a repeat examination with a marker
device over site of greatest pain may be beneficial.


Brief Hospital Course:
75 yof with htn, h/o CAD, CHF, CKD, breast CA who presented with
BRBPR.

GIB - Initially concerning given her risk factors and hematocrit
drop initially.  However, the tagged RBC scan did not show a
significant area of bleeding.  Given that her hct was stable and
she did not have signficnat BRBPR after the initial episode, GI
recommended having a colonoscopy in 1 months time.  Cause of the
bleeding was likely mesenteric ischemia vs. diverticulosis vs.
AVM. However given stranding on CT and no symptoms while NPO,
mesenteric isc
