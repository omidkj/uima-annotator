CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Increased secretions.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 51-year-old
male with severe restrictive lung disease secondary to polio
and severe right kyphoscoliosis and paraplegia, COPD on
chronic steroids, status post trach, who presents with a
chief complaint of increased secretions.  The patient reports
that within the last few days he has been experiencing some
shortness of breath and increased secretions and requested
assistance by calling EMS.  The patient has a home vent which
is set at pressure support of 15 by 5 and FIO2 of 21% by
EMTs.  He was brought to the Emergency Room where chest x-ray
was performed which was unremarkable for infiltrate.  The
patient was suctioned with medium amount of white sputum.
While in the Emergency Room the patient was noted to have
increased congestion and transient saturation to 90%.  The
patient's saturation improved while being bagged.  He was
suctioned and his blood pressure elevated to 200/100.  He was
given Hydralazine and transferred to medical ICU for further
evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1) Restrictive lung disease secondary
to kyphosis, polio.  No pulmonary function tests available.
2) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  3) Bronchiectasis
status post multiple pneumonias.  4) Chronic tracheostomy.
Patient reports he is vented at night and is able to tolerate
trach mask during the day.  5) Hypertension.  6) History of
DVT in 11/92.  7) History of C. diff in 7/94.  8) Chronic
pain syndrome.  9) Obesity.  10) Recent admission to [**Hospital1 2025**] with
treatment with high dose steroids tapered and Levaquin.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Significant for back pain, cough with
sputum that is yellowish, reported low grade fevers, no
chills or shakes, no abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation
or dysuria.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient lives at home and has VNA services
provided 8 hours per day.  VNA phone number is [**Telephone/Fax (1) 101906**].
His stent is serviced by [**Last Name (un) 55557**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 101907**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Generally patient is a chronically ill
appearing man with trach.  Marked obesity, especially of the
neck.  Vital signs, temperature 100.5, pulse 96, blood
pressure 171/68, respiratory rate 16, O2 saturation 98% on
21% FIO2, set at pressure support of 15 and PEEP of 5.
HEENT: Pupils round and reactive to light, JVD unable to
assess secondary to neck obesity, mucus membranes moist.
Heart, regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, rub or gallop,
hyperdynamic PMI.  Lungs rhonchorus bilaterally without
wheezes.  Abdomen soft, nontender, non distended with well
healed midline scar.  Extremities with 1+ bilateral edema.
Neuro, alert and oriented times three, bilateral hand grip
with normal strength, 1+ strength in lower extremities, deep
tendon reflexes 0-1+ throughout.

LABORATORY DATA:  On admission revealed white count of 10.2
with differential of 68 neutrophils, 20 lymphs, 9 monos,
hematocrit 42.5, and platelet count 316,000.  His sodium was
141, potassium 2.6, chloride 105, CO2 24, BUN 10 and
creatinine 0.2, glucose 87.  PTT 22.1, INR 1.2.

EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 97 beats per minute, normal
intervals, axis 97 degrees, right atrial enlargement, poor R
wave progression, 1 PAC, T wave flattening and T wave
inversion in V1 to V3, right bundle branch block appearing.
This was the EKG in the Emergency Room.  On arrival to the
floor the patient was also noted to have ST depression of 1
mm in 3 and F with heart rate at 116 and blood pressure of
213/89.

Chest x-ray showed severe right kyphoscoliosis, no effusion,
no infiltrate, difficult to assess heart size.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, the patient is a 51-year-old
man with chronic restrictive lung disease secondary to polio
and musculoskeletal abnormalities, COPD, on chronic
ventilation through a trach, presenting with increased
congestion and low grade fevers.  His issues during this
hospitalization included:

1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient was noted to be hypertensive
to 200/100.  At the time of admission he was not symptomatic,
however, his EKG showed ST depressions in leads 3 and F.  For
his hypertensive emergency the patient was started on
Labetalol with normal elevation of his blood pressure to
120's and reversal of EKG changes to baseline.  In addition,
patient was ruled out for myocardial ischemia with serial CKs
and troponin which were normal.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient did present with congestion and
shortness of breath.  He did not appear to be in congestive
heart failure and there was no evidence of pneumonia on his
chest x-ray.  However, patient was started on Zithromycin for
possible bronchitis.  He completed the course of antibiotics
while in the hospital.  After initial low grade fever
recorded on admission, the patient remained afebrile.  The
patient did not appear to be in COPD exacerbation so there
was no indication for high dose steroids.

3.  Fluids, Electrolytes & Nutrition:  On presentation the
patient was hyperkalemic and hypermagnesemic.  It was thought
to be due to the diuretic use without potassium replacement.
The patient's potassium was repleted by mouth within a few
days.  The delay was caused by patient's refusal to take
medication.

4.  Prophylaxis during this hospitalization.  The patient was
maintained on subcu Heparin and Protonix.

5.  Social issues:  Per patient report, he lives
independently in [**Hospital1 778**] Apartments with daily VNA services.
Social work was involved in patient's management in addition
to the case manager to clarify the services he obtains.
There was an issue of vent cleaning-apparently patient
prohibited the VNA to clean his vent, partially leading to
his difficulties ventilating.  The patient appears to be more
compliant with his care at present time.  On admission
patient's VNA was notified of patient's hospitalization and
promptly reassigned his services.  His discharge was delayed
due to the lack of staff to provide VNA services for him.

FOLLOW-UP:  The patient has a follow-up appointment with his
primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 101908**], [**Telephone/Fax (1) 101909**] at [**Hospital1 2025**] on
[**5-20**] at 3:30 p.m.  In addition he was scheduled to see a
pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on Thursday, [**4-28**] at 9:15 a.m. on
the [**Location (un) 1773**] of [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Building.

On [**4-11**] the care of this patient was transferred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Name (STitle) **] who will dictate an addendum to this discharge summary
that will include the discharge medications.
