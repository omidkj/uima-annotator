Admission Date:  [**2182-9-23**]       Discharge Date:  [**2182-10-3**]



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old man with
history of end stage renal disease on hemodialysis,
hypertension, non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, PVD,
admitted day #4 postoperatively for elective L4,5 lumbar
His operation was uncomplicated, however, he had a presumed
aspiration day #1 postoperatively which led to respiratory
distress, unresponsiveness requiring intubation and he was
transferred to SICU.  Bronchoscopy was performed on [**2182-9-24**]
with finding consistent with bleeding from ETT trauma and
positive evidence of food in lower airway consistent with
aspiration.  ENT consult noted no significant laceration,
patient's SICU course was notable for extubation on [**9-25**], he
continued hemodialysis per renal team and unexplained
hypotension despite increased fluid volume.  Cortisol
stimulation test was done today which was normal.  The
patient had swallowing evaluation which he failed during the
SICU stay.  The patient was transferred to medical service on
[**2182-9-27**] for further management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End stage renal disease, non-insulin
dependent diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, peripheral
vascular disease, status post right fem tib bypass, status
post right toe amputation, pulmonary nodule awaiting biopsy,
LBP, L4,L5 stenosis, status post L4,L5 decompressive
laminectomy on [**2182-9-23**], glaucoma, hypertension, atrial
fibrillation, positive PPD.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:  Insulin sliding scale, Xalatan
0.005% GTT q d, Alphagan 0.2% GTT [**Hospital1 **], Neurontin 200 mg po
bid, Prandin 0.25 mg po if blood sugar below 150, Coreg 6.25
mg po q d, Cosopt GTT [**Hospital1 **], Lipitor 5 mg po q d, Nephrocaps
one tablet po q d, Prozac 20 mg po q d, Phos-Lo 667 mg po
tid, Zantac 50 mg IV q 24 hours, Dilaudid 1-2 mg IV q 4 hours
prn, Albuterol nebulizers q 4 hours prn.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies alcohol or smoking
history.  Lives with his wife.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission patient is afebrile,
blood pressure 120/60, heart rate 62, respiratory rate 16, O2
saturation 96 on two liters.  The patient is with no acute
distress, alert and oriented times three.  HEENT:  Pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation,
oropharynx clear, mucus membranes dry.  Neck, no jugulovenous
distension.  Lungs, rales at the left base, expiratory
rhonchi, otherwise clear to auscultation.  Cardiovascular,
irregular irregular, no audible murmurs.  Abdomen soft, non
distended, nontender with positive bowel sounds.  Extremities
without edema and palpable pulsations bilaterally.  Right
second toe status post amputation.  Skin reveals two skin
ulcers with clean dressing, two dry necrotic toe like small
ulcers on each foot.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 77-year-old man who was admitted
for decompressive laminectomy L4,L5, who developed
postoperative day #1 aspiration resulting in respiratory
distress requiring transient intubation, who was initially
hospitalized on SICU and then transferred to medicine for
further management for dysphagia.

1.  Pulmonary:  The patient developed aspiration
postoperative day #1 which led into aspiration/chemical
pneumonitis.  His treatment consisted of oxygen through nasal
cannula but patient was not on antibiotics since he remained
afebrile throughout the course of hospitalization.  Three
days post aspiration patient did not require any
supplementary oxygen and his lung exam significantly
improved.

2.  Dysphagia:  The patient developed severe dysphagia
postoperatively, failed three swallowing video studies for
solid and liquid food.  Initially NG tube was inserted with
nutritional supplement feeding.  He had PEG placement
inserted on [**2182-10-2**] without complications.  During
endoscopic evaluation there were several ulcers found in his
stomach which were biopsied but the results of biopsy are
pending on the date of discharge.  The patient was seen by a
nutrition consult and feeding through the PEG was recommended
and patient started this on [**10-3**], one day after PEG was
placed.  He also received TPN through IV line for several
days prior to PEG placement.  He will continue on Protonix
and additional studies such as H. pylori antibody was sent
which results are still pending during discharge.  If this
result is positive, patient should be treated with
antibiotics since this could be cause for his findings during
endoscopy.

The cause of his severe dysphagia was believed to be due to
mechanical cause and patient might be evaluated in several
months with additional swallowing study.

Renal, patient has end stage renal disease on hemodialysis,
continued hemodialysis during hospitalization without
complications.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood count on discharge 8.1,
hematocrit 31.4, hemoglobin 10.1, platelet count 370,000, PT
12.8, PTT 32.5, INR 1.1, glucose 144, BUN 43, creatinine 6.3,
sodium 140, potassium 4.4, chloride 105, CO2 24, liver
function tests within normal limits, albumin 2.6, calcium
8.6, phosphorus 5.6, magnesium 2.5, free calcium 1.16.

Swallowing study revealed aspiration involving thick as well
as thin barium, no cough reflex was elicited.  EKG revealed
sinus rhythm, borderline first degree AV block, left atrial
abnormality.  Biopsies from the stomach ulcer are still
pending on the day of discharge.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Status post L4,L5 laminectomy.
2.  Aspiration pneumonia.
3.  Dysphagia, status post PEG placement on [**10-2**].
4.  ESRD on hemodialysis.
5.  Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
6.  Peripheral vascular disease.
7.  Hypertension.
8.  Glaucoma.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Nepro 10 cc per hour, could be
advanced by 10 cc q 6-8 hours (go 40 units per hour),
Protonix 40 mg through PEG tube [**Hospital1 **], Pilocarpine 4% one drop
OU [**Hospital1 **], Albuterol nebulizers four puffs q 4 hours prn,
Phos-Lo 6.7 mg po tid, Prozac 20 mg q d, Xalatan 0.005% GTT
[**Hospital1 **], Alphagan 0.2% GTT [**Hospital1 **], SSRI, Coreg 6.25 mg q d,
Nephrocaps one tablet q d, Neurontin 200 mg [**Hospital1 **], Lipitor 5 mg
