History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) **] is a 41 year-old female with AML status post HIDAC
and MRD allo-[**Name14 (STitle) 3242**] [**9-/2127**] with remission but subsequent relapse
with CNS involvement in [**1-/2129**] treated with XRT and IT MEC
chemo with eventual remission. She presented again in [**7-/2129**]
with HC and elevated ICP, and VP shunt was placed. She was
readmitted on [**2129-8-1**] from clinic with altered mental status
and low-grade fever. Her work-up in the hospital included normal
shunt series, normal VP tap (but protein 60) and unremarkable
LP. Work-up further revealed bilateral hilar infiltrates on CXR,
with preserved saturation at presentation. Subsequent imaging
included CT chest which showed bilateral ground glass opacities
with upper lobe predominance. Sputum culture was negative. While
in hospital, she was persistently febrile to 102 on [**8-3**].
Pulmonary was consulted, and bronchoscopy performed on [**2129-8-4**]
showed thin secretions, but was otherwise largely underwhelming.
A BAL grew no organisms, and rapid viral screen was negative.
On the floor, she developed a new oxygen requirement on [**2129-8-7**]
of 2L via NC. Repeat imaging studies also showed progression of
infiltrates, and concern was raised over possible PCP (last
inhaled Pentamidine dose [**2129-7-14**]). She was started on empiric
Rx for PCP with Bactrim and Prednisone on [**2129-8-7**], and
Levofloxacin was added to cover for atypicals. She transiently
defervesced on the floor, but developed progressive hypoxemia
with increasing oxygen requirement to 6L NC, then shovel mask,
and eventually NRB. ABG on floor on shovel mask 70% 7.28/31/71.
Antifungal coverage was added on [**2129-8-9**] (Caspofungin). She was
given Lasix 20 mg IV, then 10 mg IV, with U/O 700mL without much
improvement in her respiratory status. An ICU consult was
called.
Other issues on the floor have included hyponatremia with nadir
to 122, with elevated UOsm and UNa suggestive of SIADH. Renal
has been following.
On arrival to ICU, patient tachypneic, hypoxemic to 70s on RA,
96% on NRB. She denies chest pain, mild non-productive cough.

Past Medical History:
1) AML
- [**9-7**]: Dx with M5 AML. Presented c cholecystitis, found to
have
WBC 56k with 50% blasts and plts 20. Marrow biopsy at [**Hospital1 18**]
showed AML. The cholecystitis perforated, resulting in emergent
open chole complicated by fistula and bleeding and 2 month stay
in MICU. Daily Hydroxyurea was used for maintenence until she
recovered.
She had initial cytogenetic abnormality of inversion-16 which
also had resolved.  (7+3) Induction was done when she was
stable.
- [**2127-11-10**] repeat marrow showed a markedly hypercellular marrow
with no blast clusters and CD34+ blasts comprising less than 3%
of the cellularity.
- [**2127-12-4**] started Consolidation with four cycles of HIDAC
- [**2127**]: bone marrow biopsy later shows relapsed acute leukemia.
Salvage therapy with mitoxantrone/etoposide. Course was
complicated by very-delayed count recovery. Marrow bx after day
30 did show evidence of recovering marrow without a clear
increase in blasts although there were some monocyte precursors
noted. They were thought to not resemble her underlying
leukemia.
- d0 [**2128-10-1**] MRD allo SCT.
- [**2129-1-14**]: admission for relapsed leukemia in the CSF and R
bell's
palsy. Base of skull XRT and intrathecal chemotherapy through an
ommaya reservoir ([**2129-1-7**]) placed during her admission
- [**Date range (1) 57171**]: continued on q2week Depo ARA-C, also with
withdrawing immunosuppression. There was noted rising LFTs,
unclear whether [**1-6**] GVH vs the underlying Hep C.
- MEC finished on [**3-20**]
- Biweekly intrathecal depocyt started [**2-7**], last dose [**2129-4-10**]
- DLI [**2129-4-6**]
2. Endocarditis in [**2125**]
3. MI [**2125**]
4. AVR [**2125**]
5. MVR [**2125**]
6. Stroke with left hemiparesis [**2125**]
7. Hepatitis C: HCV Ab positive [**2-/2128**], VL [**4-9**] 22,100,000,
liver biopsy in [**2-7**] with stage 1-2 fibrosis and bile duct
damage likely [**1-6**] hep C but cannot exclude GVHD
8. Asthma: only on prn albuterol MDI
9. GERD
10. h/o coag neg staph, VRE

Social History:
She presently is living in [**Hospital6 **] home. Her
sister-in-law prepares her medications for her. She is widowed
and her husband died from complications related to pancreatitis.
She doesn't have children. She previously worked as a computer
programmer with 2 years college training. She has not worked for
two years and is assisted through [**Social Security Number 57174**]social security disability.
She has a previous history of heroin use which she stopped in
[**9-6**].

Family History:
No family history of malignancy. Her mother has hypertension,
her father had type II diabetes and died from an MI and stroke
at the age of 57, and her brother has HIV.


Physical Exam:

GEN: Tachypneic, unable to speak with full sentences in moderate
respiratory distress. Anxious.
HEENT: Slightly dry MM. JVP difficult to assess secondary to
respiratory distress.

RELEVANT IMAGING DATA:
[**2129-8-3**] CT CHEST W/O: Multiple focal areas of ground-glass
opacity in both lungs and peribronchial infiltration are more
prominent in the upper lobes, and confluent in the left apex.
There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.

[**2129-8-7**] CT CHEST W/O: Worsening diffuse bilateral patchy ground
glass opacities with an upper lobe predominance. This appearance
is most consistent with an atypical infection such as PCP or
viral pneumonia, as noted previously. Non-infectious etiologies

such as drug reaction could also be considered.

[**2129-8-9**] CXR portable: The previously described extensive
bilateral parenchymal densities are again identified. They have
progressed to a moderate degree in the left mid lung field and
lower lung field whereas on the right base, a certain degree of
regression can be identified. On both films, there is no
evidence of pleural
fluid accumulation in the lateral pleural sinuses.

[**2129-8-10**] CXR portable: Increase bilateral airspace opacities
with decreased lung volumes

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 41 year-old female with AML in remission, with progressive
hypoxemic respiratory failure. Family meeting was held yesterday
with Heme-Onc team. Pt will be made CMO this afternoon after her
brothers have spoken to her mother. Otherwise ct with current
treatment.

1) Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The cause of her acute
respiratory decompensation was unclear to the housestaff team.
Within the first day or two of her admission to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] there
was a drastic change in her cxray. She now had multilobular
opacities suggestive of an ARDs like picture. She was placed on
broad spectrum antibiotics-Aztreonam, Vancomycin, Flagyl,
Caspofungin, Levoquin along with Bactrim and steroids for
presumptive PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 31304**]. No nidus of infection was found and
all culture data was negative. She was also
