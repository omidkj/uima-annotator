Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3043**]
Chief Complaint:
fever

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardial window and chest tube placement-[**2113-9-1**]


History of Present Illness:
46 year old man with advanced AIDS with CD4 count of 1 and viral
load of 30,000 on HARRT (Darunavir/Etravirine/Truvada and
Raltegravir) through a clinical trial who presented to OSH with
shortness of breath, chest pain, and fever. Patient reports that
2 days PTA, he began having chest pain that he describes as a
very heavy person sitting on his chest, it did not radiate, was
worse when he leaned forward or took a deep breath, better when
laying back and was accompanied by mild SOB. He took ASA and
Celebrex (that a friend gave him) and the pain got better. His
pain worsened w/ fevers to the low 101 one day PTA.  He
initially went to [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital. He was found to have a mild
elevation of troponins, negative d-dimer. His EKG showed PR
depression in the inferior leads. An echo which revealed
pericardial effusion. He has no history of coronary artery
disease and was diagnosed with "pericarditits".  He continued to
have symptoms and his TTE showed rapidly increasing pericardial
effusion with tamponade physiology.  He was taken to OR
emergently by C-[**Doctor First Name **] on [**2113-9-1**] for pericardial window
placement.  Patient states that his breathing improved markedly
post procedure.  However overnight he was found to be hypoxic
with new oxygen requirement (c/t post window status) to 4LNC.
He continued to spike temp to 102 and his HR also increased from
110s to 140s, sinus tachycardia.  His UOP decreased overnight
and recieved 40 IV lasix at midnight and has put out >2.5 L to
that.  He recieved another 40 IV lasix early this morning. His
pleuritic chest pain worsened however still markedly better than
his admission pain.  Patient was transfered to CCU for further
management of his care.
.
He denies any palpitations, worsening shortness of breath,
nausea, vomitting, diaphoresis, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
constipation, headache, neck stiffness, lower extremity
swelling.  Review of systems is otherwise negative.

Pertinent Results:
[**2113-8-31**] TTE
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a
normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
a small pericardial effusion. The effusion appears
circumferential. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal systolic function. Small pericardial effusion with no
evidence of tamponade

[**2113-9-1**] TTE
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with normal free
wall contractility. There is a moderate sized circumferential
pericardial effusion. There is brief right ventricular diastolic
invagination consistent with elevated intrapericardial pressure,
low right-sided filling pressures, or both.

IMPRESSION: Moderate sized pericardial effusion with evidence of
elevated intrapericardial pressures.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-8-31**],
pericardial effusion may be slightly larger. The other findings
are similar.

[**2113-9-1**] TTE
The left atrium is normal in size. A patent foramen ovale is
present. The estimated right atrial pressure is 0-5 mmHg.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed
(LVEF= 30-35 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There are three
aortic valve leaflets. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is a large
pericardial effusion. The effusion appears circumferential. The
pericardium appears thickened. There is right ventricular
diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade
physiology.

Pericardial fluid drained surgically with resolution of
tmaponade physiology.
Small size left sided pleural effusion

[**2113-9-3**] TTE
There is a small pericardial effusion appears somewhat echo
dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or other cellular
elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade. No
right atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-9-1**], the
pericardial effusion size has decreased.

[**2113-9-5**] TTE
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular
chamber size is normal. There is abnormal septal motion
suggestive of pericardial constriction. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. The left ventricular inflow
pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with
elevated left atrial pressure. There is a small pericardial
effusion with echodense elements in the pericardial space
consistent with organization and probable adhesion/pericardial
constriction. The pericardium appears thickened.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2113-9-3**] ,
findings are similar.

CT Head
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is moderate mucosal
thickening involving the anterior ethmoidal air cells,
bilaterally, and limited included left maxillary sinus, which
appears new (though bone algorithm reconstructions were not
performed, previously). The remaining included paranasal
sinuses, as well as the mastoid air cells and middle ear
cavities are clear, as above.

Such findings are seen commonly in HIV(+) patients, and should
be correlated clinically.

Abdominal Ultrasound:
1. Right interpolar hypoechoic focus, while likely represents a
prominent
renal pyramid, cannot exclude a small focus of pyelonephritis.
2. Gallbladder wall edema, with pericholecystic fluid, but no
gallbladder
wall distention. Unlikely to represent acute cholecystitis.
Likely secondary
to IV hydration or low oncotic pressure.
3. Three left and one right lobe hepatic hemangioma as described
above.
Essentially unchanged in size and appearance compared to the
prior CT study,
allowing the difference of technique.
4. Small amount of ascites.
