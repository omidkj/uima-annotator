Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3266**]
Chief Complaint:
sepsis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. intubation [**9-19**]
2. central line placement [**9-19**]
3. lumbar puncture [**9-19**]
4. Paracentesis [**9-19**]

History of Present Illness:
35 yo woman transferred from OSH with sepsis. Per report, pt
presented to the OSH with altered mental status, headache
(possibly her typical migraine), myalgias, n/v, and slurred
speech; these symptoms had reportedly been present for 2 days.
At the OSH she was initially afebrile (100.7 orally) but soon
spiked a temperature to 102; she was initially tachycardic but
was otherwise hemodynamically stable throughout her time there.
Her physical examination was reportedly noteworthy for mild
lethargy, slightly dry mucous membranes, and no meningeal signs;
her exam was reportedly otherwise unremarkable. Her labs were
noteworthy for a WBC of 16.6 (75 PMN, 20 bands, 3 monos, 2 eos),
Hct 36.1 (baseline high 20's), plt 31 (baseline low 40's); Na
130, no anion gap, albumin 2.7, INR 1.9, AST 80, ALT 81, alk
phos 146, bili 2.6 (direct 0.85). U/A hazy, 3+ blood, 15-25 RBC,
no WBC/bacteria. LP not done due to thrombocytopenia and
coagulopathy. Two units FFP were given prior to a diagnostic
paracentesis that reportedly demonstrated ~2300 WBC with 87%
PMN. A head CT was reportedly normal. She received vancomycin 1
gram iv, ampicillin 1 gram iv, Zosyn, ceftriaxone 2 grams iv,
and hydrocortisone 100 mg iv at the OSH. A RIJ central line was
placed there. OSH blood cxs were already growing gram negative
rods by time of arrival here. She is transferred here for
further management since her hepatologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**], is based
here.

Past Medical History:
1. primary sclerosing cholangitis vs. stricture in the CBD
2. Crohn's disease s/p ex-lap with cecectomy and ileectomy [**2108**]
3. autoimmune hepatitis c/b cirrhosis with portal HTN,
splenomegaly, and varices, listed for liver [**Year (4 digits) **]
4. diffusely thickened gallbladder wall with increased
enhancement on MRCP [**9-10**] (suggesting chronic cholecystitis vs.
inflammation due to PSC vs. diffuse neoplastic process)
5. possible early proliferative phase of myelofibrosis vs.
hypercellularity of autoimmune disease
6. R adrenal adenoma
7. moderate L pleural effusion
8. R nephrolithiasis
9. depression
10. anxiety
11. raynaud's phenomenon
13. fibromyalgia
14. dermatitis herpetaformis

Brief Hospital Course:
35 yo woman with autoimmune hepatitis leading to cirrhosis
currently undergoing evaluation for liver transplantation,
Crohn's disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis, pancytopenia,
who was transferred from OSH with sepsis most likely due to
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis complicated by bacteremia. She
was in the MICU from [**9-19**] - [**9-22**]. Then she was transferred to
the floor.

1. Sepsis:
The pt was initially empirically treated with Ceftriaxone for a
presumed SBP, along with Vancomycin and Flagyl to cover possible
secondary SBP and/or cholangitis. An LP was preformed revealing
no WBC's.  Blood and urine cx's did not grow out anything. Blood
cultures from the OSH however, grew out Klebsiella x2, sensitive
to Levofloxacin, but only intermediately sensitive to Cefoxitin,
so her Ceftriaxone was switched to Levofloxacin.  A repeat
paracentesis was preformed on HD2 which revealed ~1100 WBCs,
down from 2300 at prior to admission.  Because the WBC decline
was not as substantial as anticipated on Levofloxcin, Flagyl and
Vancomycin were continued. She was given a course of sepsis dose
hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone for 7 days.  She did not
require pressors. She becamse hemodynamically stable and was
transferred to the floor. The patient did not have a repeat
paracentesis because her white count continued to decline.
Flagyl was stopped on [**9-26**]. Levofloxacin will be continued for a
total of 14 days from the start and she will be placed on Cipro
500 qd for SBP ppx.

2. Altered Mental Status:
Altered MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 2771**] to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy
secondary to overwhelming sepsis.  Other etiololgies for altered
mental status were investigated: An LP was preformed to rule out
meningitis.  Head CT was preformed and was negative.  Ammonia
levels were checked given her history of cirrhosis, and returned
only mildly elevated at 49.  Serum and urine tox screens were
negative.  Once extubated, pt was alert and oriented with
baseline MS.

3. Respiratory Distress:
On admission patient had a primary respiratory alkalosis
secondary to persistent tachypnea, likely induced by her septic
state.  In addition she had a lactic acidosis.  Her RR had been
greater than 30 for nearly 12hours on admission, hence she was
intub
