.
Initial history obtained from records and telephone conversation
with ex-husband [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 100489**].

HPI: The patient is a 60 year old woman with history of hepC
cirrhosis, HCC on liver [**Name (NI) **] list who was found
unresponsive at home earlier today by her home health aide and
eventually referred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Her ex-husband last saw the
patient on [**Name (NI) **] Day when she joined them for dinner. Per
his report, she seemed shaky but otherwise near her baseline.
Saturday he called the patient and she was slurring her words
notably and sleepy sounding. She stated to him sshe had been
taking her medication including "something for sleep." He stated
that he had concerns for oxycontin use although he was unsure
she had any available because he had thought that she had a
recent prescription. He called monday and had no answer via
telephone. She was initially brought to an OSH where vitals were
normal. She was described as AOx2. She had basic chemistries
which were notable for Na of 131, Cr1.3, Tbili 4.2, ammonia 79,
Serum Tox negative. Empiric narcan was given without significant
effect. A head CT was unremarkable. She received haldol 5mg IV
x2, ativan 1mg iv x1 for agitation. She received 1 liter of NS.
She was transfered for further evaluation.
.
Of note, she was admitted [**Date range (1) 100490**] for abdominal
distention and pain at which time paracentesis was performed
with was negative for SBP. MRI during that admission showed 2
enhancing lesions in the right lobe of the liver that are
concerning for hepatocellular carcinoma, especially in view of
an increased AFP to >140 from her baseline of 50-70. She was
considered for biopsy early in the new year.
.
Upon arrival in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, her vital signs were 98.9 80
130/72 18 99%RA. A CXR was done. NGt was placed. U/S abd showed
only small amount of ascites to no paracentesis was attempted.
She received levofloxacin for a UA that was concerning for
infection.

ROS: unobtainable

Imaging:
OSH CT head ([**2168-12-12**])- motion artifact. no gross pathology
.
CXR: The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
normal. The lungs are clear with no pleural effusion,
pneumothorax or focal consolidation. The osseous structures of
the thorax appear normal.

CYTOLOGY: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELS

RENAL U/S: No hydro, masses, stones

ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2168-12-30**]
 The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
(LVEF 70%) There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**12-14**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2168-7-19**], mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are now
present; mild pulmonary hypertension also present.

Abd U/S -  [**2169-1-2**]
1. Cirrhotic liver with unchanged massive ascites and
gallbladder wall thickening.
2. Unchanged 2-cm lesion within the right lobe.
3. Patent portal vein, hepatic veins, and hepatic artery.

U/S [**2169-1-12**]
Son[**Name (NI) 493**] imaging of the abdomen reveals a large amount of
peritoneal ascites. A suitable skin site was selected and marked
on the skin in the right lower quadrant for paracentesis to be
performed by the medicine service.
