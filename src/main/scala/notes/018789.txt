Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2181**]
Chief Complaint:
Back pain, Chills

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar Puncture, Intubation/Extubation

History of Present Illness:
71F with hx of diet controlled insulin insensitivity (HBa1c
6.0), HTN, GERD, and LE neuropathy being transferred from OSH ED
for concern of epidural abscess. Patient presented to [**Hospital1 2519**] ED with 2 weeks of headache, malaise, mid-low back
pain, and chills having been recently tested for and started on
bactrim x 1 day for a UTI by his PCP (positive UA and UCx from
[**4-6**] with 100k colonies of pan-sensitive E. coli). Her ROS was
negative for visual changes, neck stiffness, or altered
thinking. Per ED attending note, her initial VS were 98F, 97,
130/66, 20, 96%RA. She had CBC with a white count of 2, a UA
with leukesterase but per report no wbc's or bacteria, lactate
WNL's, and had a CT abd/pelv non-con which was unremarkable and
read as c/w gastroenteritis, and a CT head that was
unremarkable. She 2 weeks prior had a brain MRI with findings of
old left basal ganglia lacunar infarct. She later developed a
fever of 100.7 and downtrending blood pressures (initial [**Location (un) 1131**]
in records from OSH shows 68/45, all others wnl's), rec'd single
doses of vanc/ceftriaxone 1gm/levofloxacin as well as 4LNS.
Patient had central line placed but no pressors started at OSH.
She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and
management with concern for possible spinal epidural abscess.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 6 100.0 103 90/45 24 93% 3LNC
-She was given another 2LNS and started on levophed given low
BP's
-Administered another gram of ceftriaxone for meningitic dosing
-Intubated for airway protection per report
-LP performed, studies pending
-MRI total spine with wetread negative for infection of spine
-Transferred to the unit for further management
.
On arrival to the MICU, patient is fully sedated and intubated
with initial VS of 98.8, 67, 139/68, 16, 100% on the ventilator.
Spoke with patients daughter and son who confirm the above
history and state that yesterday evening she went bowling (one
of her favorite activities) and went home after starting the
bactrim. That evening she described feeling unwell and was
brought to the ED by her daughter. Of note, she was admitted 2
years ago to [**Hospital1 112**] apparently for sepsis and underwent a temporal
artery biopsy for suspected temporal arteritis which was per
family report negative.

IMAGING/STUDIES:

[**2192-4-12**] Radiology CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST:
1. Small left lower lobe consolidation, concerning for
pneumonia.
2. Left ventricle enlargement.
3. Enlarged pulmonary artery, suggestive of pulmonary arterial
hypertension.
4. Calcified right thyroid nodule. Further evaluation is
recommended with
non-urgent ultrasound.

[**2192-4-12**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
FINDINGS:
Tip of the endotracheal tube ends approximately 4.4 cm above the
carina, right internal jugular line terminates at mid SVC, and
orogastric tube is seen to course into the stomach; however, the
distal end is looped with the tip in the fundus. Since
yesterday's radiograph, increased opacity in the left lower
lung, reflecting atelectasis, has improved. Small left pleural
effusion is unchanged. There are no new lung opacities on the
right side. Minimal opacity in the right lung base from the
prior radiograph has resolved suggesting it was atelectasis.
Heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is
no pneumothorax.

[**2192-4-11**] Radiology MR C/T/L-SPINE W& W/O CONTR:
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of spondylodiscitis, epidural or paraspinal
abscess/phlegmon throughout the entire spine.
2. No pathologic focus of enhancement.
3. Severe multifactorial degenerative disease of the
mid-cervical spine with secondary kyphosis, ventral canal
narrowing, and cord "confinement" and remodeling; however, there
is no abnormality of spinal cord signal.
4. Degenerative disc disease in the lower lumbosacral spine with
subarticular zone and neural foraminal stenosis and resultant
neural impingement, as detailed above.
5. Bilateral pleural effusions with apparent associated
subsegmental
atelectasis, incompletely imaged; correlate with dedicated chest
radiography.

[**2192-4-11**] Radiology CHEST (PORTABLE AP):
IMPRESSION:
Appropriate position of lines and tubes. No pneumothorax. Left
retrocardiacopacity likely representing atelectasis.


Brief Hospital Course:
71F with hx of diet controlled DM2, HTN, and LE neuropathy
transferred from OSH ED and admitted to the MICU intubated with
presumed sepsis.
