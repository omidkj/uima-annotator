C-Spine MR
IMPRESSION:
1) Multilevel cervical spondylosis. Central canal stenosis at
C3-C4 through C6-C7 associated with central cord edema. Grade 1
anterolisthesis of C3 on C4.
2) Unusual configuration of the dens worrisome for a fracture
deformity although there is no marrow edema to suggest acute
injury. Thickened soft tissue in at the atlantoaxial joint
suggests pannus. Correlation with CT is recommended.

CT C-spine
IMPRESSION: Changes in the odontoid process from rheumatoid
arthritis. No evidence of atlantoaxial subluxation. No acute
fracture visible by CT. There may be ligamentous laxity and
instability from degenerative change, and this cannot be
assessed with the static imagese acquired.

L-Spine MR
IMPRESSION:
Bilateral L5 spondylolysis with grade 1/grade 2 anterolisthesis
of L5 on S1. Resultant narrowing of the bilateral neural foramen
at that level. Probable prominent synovial tissue versus
fibrosis projecting toward the right neural foramen; a
nonemergent contrast-enhanced lumbar spine MRI may be useful for
further characterization.

[**2197-5-8**] Cervical Decompression
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
1. Total laminectomy of C4, C5, C6 and C7.
2. Fusion C4 - C7.
3. Autograft.


Brief Hospital Course:
Cervical Spinal Stenosis
The patient presented with cervical spinal stenosis with
associated cord edema between C3 and C7.  Additionally, a
C-spine MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 12039**] of a dens fracture but a CT c-spine
did not corroborate this finding.  The patient was seen by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 363**] of ortho spine in the emergency department, and a
cervical decompression was planned; meanwhile the patient was
admitted for pain control.  The patient was started on oxycontin
and this was titrated up to 20mg [**Hospital1 **].  She was given initially
morphine and then oxycodone for breakthrough pain.  She was
started on a beta-blocker preop.  She underwent an uncomplicated
cervical decompression on [**2197-5-8**].  Post operatively she was
briefly on a morphine pca.  She worked with the physical
therapists.  She was transferred to the ortho-spine service, and
was taken back to the OR on ... for an anterior stabilization.

Low Back Pain
The patient also has L5-S1 disc bulge and neural foraminal
stenosis per L-spine MR, likely contributing to her low back
pain.  Her pain was managed as above.  Physical therapy was
consulted.

Left calf pain
The day after surgery the patient complained of pain in her left
calf, and on exam, the calf was more firm than the other side.
She undewent a left-sided LENI which did not show a DVT.  Her
pain resolved, and she was able to ambulate with PT.

Rheumatoid arthritis
The patient was continued on her outpatient medications; her
naproxen was held prior to surgery.  In addition to her daily
10mg of prednisone, she was given stress dose steroids the day
of her surgery.

Asthma
The patient was contined on her outpatient inhalers.

Ulcerative keratitis
The patient said that she no longer used the prednisolone eye
drops.

Diabetes
The patient was continued on avandia (held while she was NPO),
and additionally a long acting insulin and a HISS were added.
