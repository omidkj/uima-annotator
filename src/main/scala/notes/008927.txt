History of Present Illness:
This is a 76 year old female with difficulty walking and
weakness in her hands.  She said that the hand weakness began
approximately two months ago and progressed.  Two weeks prior to
admission, she saw a surgeon about these symptoms and an MRI of
her neck was ordered.  She was found to have a "bulging disc"
and told she should go for surgery.

During the week prior to admission, she also began to experience
difficulty
walking secondary to leg weakness. She was seen initially at an
ED at an OSH.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care and
a stat MRI.

The patient denied low back pain. She also denied incontinence
or
retention and bowel symptoms.

ASSISTANT:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 33890**], M.D.

ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  1700 cc.

INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS:  5700 cc and crystalloid, 2 units packed
red blood cells.

URINE OUTPUT:  1300 cc.

DRAINS:  1 medium Hemovac, posterior cervical spine.

SPECIMENS TO PATHOLOGY:  None.

FINDINGS:
1.  Large disk herniation posterior to the posterior
    longitudinal ligament at C4-C5.
2.  Generalized cervical spondylosis.

COMPLICATIONS:  None.

INSTRUMENTATION:  Posterior instrumentation, the Vertex Max
System from [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 68677**] [**Last Name (un) 68678**] from the [**Company 1543**] Corporation was
utilized. This involved 3.5 mm self-tapping lateral mass
screws with associated rod and locking caps.

INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY:  This is a 76-year-old female,
previously very active, who was diagnosed with a C4-C5 severe
cervical stenosis. She developed mental stenosis, cervical
spondylosis, and generalized cervical stenosis, most severe
at C4-C5, but also to a lesser degree at C3-C4, C5-C6, and C6-
C7. She presented to the [**Hospital6 256**]
with increasing difficulty with ambulation.

An MRI of her lumbar spine showed severe lumbar stenosis. MRI
of her thoracic spine showed no significant central core
compression. An MRI of her cervical spine showed the above
findings. This was consistent with a previous MRI done in
[**Month (only) 216**].

She was admitted to the medical service and continued to be
evaluated. Neurology also evaluated her and agreed with the
diagnosis of cervical stenosis with myelopathy. She was
unable to ambulate without a great degree of assistance. She
had significant weakness in both her upper and lower
extremities with her lower extremities being more significant
then her upper extremities. She is hyperflexic with positive
clonus. Hoffmann inverted brachioradialis reflex have a jaw
reflex. Please see the notes for details.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was identified in the
holding area. The consents had been previously signed. The
risks and benefits of such a procedure were discussed again,
as they had been with multiple members of the family
identified by the patient as important to her care. These
risks included but were not limited to anesthesia, infection,
drill tear, nonunion, instrumentation problems, need for
reoperation, incomplete relief of her decrease in function,
paralysis, and death. Postoperative care, as well as
expectations were discussed on multiple instances with her
son, her daughter-in-law, her daughter, as well as friends
that were identified by her as close and important to her
care.

The patient was given prophylactic antibiotics IV, in terms
of cefazolin. She was given 10 mg of Decadron. She underwent
general endotracheal intubation in the C-collar without
extension of her neck. Baseline spinal cord monitoring was
obtained. She was positioned with a bolster under her left
hip, as well as between her shoulder blades. She was placed
on a regular OR bed with a horseshoe headrest. She was then
placed in a neutral to slightly extended position but
adequate for exposure. Her arms were at her sides. She was
taped down with all bony prominences carefully padded. A
heating blanket was placed on the patient. The left hip and
anterior cervical spine were prepped and draped sterilely in
the usual fashion.

An incision was made over the thyroid cartilage,
approximately 3 fingerbreadths above the clavicle,
approximately 3-4 cm in length. This was taken down through
the platysma. The platysma was almost nonexistent. The
sternocleidomastoid was identified, and the fascia was taken
down overlying the sternocleidomastoid. The carotid artery
was identified, and a narrow [**Doctor Last Name 284**] retractor was used to
immobilize the trachea and esophagus medially. This was taken
down directly onto the disk space.

The carotid tubercle was identified, and therefore the C4-C5
disk could be identified. The 90 spinal needle was placed in
the C4-C5 disk, and a lateral radiograph confirmed the level.

While the radiograph was taken, a 3 cm incision was made 2
fingerbreadths back from the anterior-superior iliac spine.
This was taken down to the fascia overlying the iliac crest.
This was incised, and the periosteum was stripped medially
and laterally along the iliac crest for approximately 2 cm. A
moist sponge was packed into that wound.

Attention was turned back to the anterior cervical spine. The
longus [**Last Name (un) **] was elevated from medial to lateral over the C4-
C5 disk and to the midbody superoinferiorly. A shadow-line
retractor was then placed under the longus [**Last Name (un) **]. The Leksell
retractor was used to remove the anterior osteophytes. A
scalpel was used to incise the disk from lateral to medial. A
curet was used to free up the disk, and a [**Doctor Last Name **] was used to
immobilize the disk space.

The [**Last Name (un) 5112**] retractor system was then placed midbody, and the
disk space was distracted. The uncinate processes were
identified bilaterally. The disk was removed sequentially
from anterior to posterior.

The posterior longitudinal ligament was identified and taken
down through the re
