Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 51 year-old male with a history of Down's syndrome,
history of chronic hepatitis B, chronic indwelling foley
catheter with recent admission for urosepsis who presents with
hypotension and fevers. The initial suspecion was for urosepsis,
however, the urine culture did not reveal any organisms. He then
developed hypoxemia with CXR concerning for pneumonia, effusion
or atelectasis in right lung lobe, although initial CXR showed
left air space disease. After initial IV ABx, he was placed on
oral levaquin. The patient had stage 2 ulcers that did not look
infected to suggest a source of fever. he was on decubitus ulcer
precautions. His hypotension, for the most part, resolved.
Baseline SBPs in the 100-110. He had no signs of sepsis.
Fludrocort was continued.

He needs to continue course of ABx (levofloxacin) for a [**11-20**]
day course, wean off oxygen, if possibe, and repeat CXR in few
days to role out progressive pleural effusion in the right side.
He may need CT chest if he has progressive effusion, however,
the sister may elect against invasive testing. She expressed
that she may vote against further hospitalizations or more
treatments. he is at risk for recurrent pneumonia/atelectasis
because of his severe kyphosis, poor inspiration effort, and
atelectasis/lung compromise. He needs insentive spirometry
whereever he goes. Again, His sister may decide for comfort
treatments only. She is the DPOA.
