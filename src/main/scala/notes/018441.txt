Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2901**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer from OSH for STEMI

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization with stent to left circumflex artery and
ballon angioplasty to OM1

History of Present Illness:
62 year old gentleman was is transferred from an outside
hosptial for urgent catheterization. He presented to Caritas
[**Hospital3 **] with 7/10 SSCP, STE of inf leads and depression of
ant and lat leads. He was given ASA, originally started on NTG
gtt and integrillin gtt. In their ED he had VT/VF for which he
was DC cardioverted 10 times and placed on Amio and lido gtts.
He was intubated and sent via [**Location (un) **] for cardiac cath.
Briefly recieved CPR for pulseless VT while being transported
via med flight. His PMH is sig for type II DM, HTN,
Hypercholestrolemia, ? CVA s/p L CEA. Of note hx of L leg Art
thrombosis s/p toe amputations on coumadin. In the cath lab he
was found to have a L dom system with total prox occlusion of
his Lcx and had successful PCI of the lesion with a stent and
subsequnt ballooning of his OM1. He required Dopamine Gtt and
IABP Amio and Lido gtt throughout the course of his cath. His HD
showed CI 4.75 with PCWP 24. He was sent to the CCU intubated,
on integrillin gtt with IABP, dopa, amio gtt. He was given 600
mg plavix through NGT.

Pertinent Results:
[**12-5**] Echo- LVEF 40%
Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild to moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal to mid inferior
and infero-lateral hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in
the left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic root is moderately dilated. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-11-30**], no
major change.
.
[**11-30**] Echo- LVEF 40%
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
and cavity size are normal. There is mild to moderate regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior and
infero-lateral hypokinesis. No masses or thrombi are seen in the
left ventricle. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is borderline normal. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are
no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2185-11-29**],
overall LVEF appears lower.
.
[**11-29**] Echo- LVEF 50-55%, Mild inf/inferolat hypokinesis, 1+ MR,
no AI. Normal RV function.
.
[**12-4**] CXR (2-view)- There is no significant interval change.
There is again seen small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is
mild prominence of the pulmonary vascular markings without overt
pulmonary edema.  Vascular pedicle is not widened and the
cardiac silhouette is normal.
.
[**11-30**] CXR- Bilateral edema/infiltrates, normal size heart
.
[**11-29**] EKG- Sinus brady, > 50% resolution of Inf ST elevations.
V1-V5 ST depressions persistent. Q waves in inf leads
.
[**11-29**] Cath-
COMMENTS:
1.  Selective coronary angiography in this left dominant system
revealed
one vessel coronary artery disease.  The LMCA, LAD and RCA had
no
significant disease.  The LCx was totally occluded proximally.
THere
was a large thrombus burden that extended into OM1.
2.  Left ventriculography was deferred.
3.  Hemodynamics demonstrated a mean RA pressure of 12 mmHg.
Pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension was noted.  The PA pressure was
59/24 mmHg.
Central aortic pressure was 87/60 with a mean of 74 (all mmHg).
Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 24 mmHg. Cardiac output
was
elevated at 10.1 L/min (index of 4.75 l/min/m2).
4.  An intra aortic balloon pump was placed in the left femoral
artery.
5.  Successful thrombectomy and PCI of a dominant circumflex
system with
placement of a 3.0x33mm bare metal stent in the proximal to mid
AV
groove circumflex coronary artery.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Intra aortic ballon pump placement.
3. Successful PCI of a dominant circumflex coronary artery using
a
3.0x33mm bare metal stent.  (see ptca comments for further
details)

Brief Hospital Course:
62M h/o DM II, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, who presented to an OSH with
SSCP with inferolateral STEMI who had subsequent episodes of
monomorphic and polymorphic VT s/p DCCV x 10 OSH.
.
# CAD- The patient was taken directly to the cath lab where he
received a BMS to LCx (3.0 x 33) with eventual TIMI III flow. He
also had a POBA to the OM 1. He presented in cardiogenic shock
and an IABP was placed and the patient was on a dopamine drip
for two days. By day 2 post intervention, the dopamine had been
weaned off, the IABP was removed and the patient was extubated.
He was maintained on ASA 325, Plavix 75 and started on a low
dose BB. Statin was initially held due to mildly elevated LFTs
in setting of MI, but was started on 10mg lipitor prior to
discharge. Recommend follow-up LFTs as an outpatient.
.
# Rhythm- The patient had sustained mono and polymorphic VT/VFib
and was DCCV x 10 prior to arrival at [**Hospital1 18**]. He was started on
an amio gtt for supression of ventricular ectopy. On day 2 post
intervention, the patient had two episodes of stable sustained
monomorphic VT at a rate of 120-130 and converted with an amio
bolus both times.
