Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 898**]
Chief Complaint:
elective transbronchial biopsy.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy
intubation


History of Present Illness:
HPI: 76 yo M with Afib, pacer, CAD s/p CABG, Ischemic CHF EF
<40% w/2+MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 34514**] dx RUL mass admitted to MICU after failing
extubation from an outpatient bronchoscopy. On [**2179-1-26**], the
patient had an elective bronchoscopy and biopsy of the lung mass
by interventional pulmonolgy. He tolerated the procedure well.
1-2 minutes post procedure the patient became hypertensive (SBP
170's to 200's), tachycardic (130's), and hypoxic to the 70's on
NRB. He was intubated and transferred to the CCU. [**Date Range **]
failure attributed to flash pulmonary edema. He was treated with
nitroglycerin gtt, lasix and saturations improved. He ruled out
for MI, ecg was unchanged and PE was ruled out with CTA. TTE was
repeated [**2179-1-26**] w/ EF<25% which is significantly decreased from
[**2179-1-7**]. Possible etiologies of flash edema vs COPD
exacerbation were considered and he has been on a 2 month slow
taper of Prednisone 5mg daily. He was extubated on [**2178-1-27**]
successfully and has remained on 2L NC thoughout today.
.
Of note, he also recently hospitalized [**Date range (1) 34515**]/05 for
symptomatic bradycardia. Pacer placed. He presented again with
SOB and found to have a mass consistent with lung cancer on CT.
He is PPD negative ([**2179-1-14**]).
.
He currently reports no sob and is sitting on the edge of his
bed without oxygen. C/o discomfort in his right chest wall since
the biopsy that has been alleviated with acetominophen. NO
cp/palp/n/v/anorexia. Ambulating well with assist and taking pos
with normal BM and urination.

Pertinent Results:
[**2179-1-26**] CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
2. Perihilar mass and prominent perihilar lymph nodes, as seen
previously.
3. Nodular opacities in the right upper lobe as seen previously.

4. New vaguely defined bibasilar nodular densities as well.
5. Status post sternotomy and coronary artery calcifications.
6. Severe emphysema.
.
[**2179-1-26**] Trans-Thoraci Echocardiogram
Ejection Fraction <25%
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity is dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is severely depressed.
3. The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular
systolic function appears depressed.
4. The aortic root is mildly dilated.
5. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. Compared to the findings of the prior study of [**2179-1-7**], left
ventricular systolic function has deteriorated.
.
Head CT:
There is stable widening of the extra-axial spaces, prominence
in the sulci and ventricles, consistent with age-related
involutional changes. The previously noted focus of hyperdensity
in the lateral right cerebellum is not appreciated on this
study. There are cerebellar calcifications, which are unchanged,
as well as basal ganglia calcifications. Some relative
hypodensity in the left temporal lobe is unchanged. There are
vascular calcifications. There is a small calcified extra-axial
mass in right frontal region suggestive of calcified meningioma,
unchanged.
With the administration of contrast, there are no metastases
evident.
There is an opacity in the right maxillary sinus, probably a
retention cyst. There is sclerosis in the right mastoid air
cells, which is unchanged, and to a lesser degree on the left.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of metastatic disease.


Brief Hospital Course:
Impression/Plan: Pt is a 76 yo M with CHF/systolic dysfunction
2+MR [**First Name (Titles) 151**] [**Last Name (Titles) **] failure in setting of
hypertensive/tachycardic stress leading to flash pulmonary
edema.
.
# Hypoxia: It was felt that this was likely [**2-25**] to CHF and
chronic COPD. After the flash pulmonary edema he improved
greatly with lasix diuresis and when called out the floor was
sat'ing in the mid 90's on room air. He was continued on an ACE
inhibitor and slow steroid taper was completed. He was evaluated
by PT and it was determined that he did not require home O2. He
was continued on his [**Month/Day (2) **] inhalers and on discharge was
recommended to consider using Spiriva.
.
# CHF: as above, his symptoms improved with diuresis. Echo
showed new global HK and depression in EF <20%, and this was
felt potentially from stunning and demand ischemia. ACEi was
started for afterload reduction and remodeling benefits and he
was started on low dose beta blocker trial and spironolactone.
2g Na diet, fluid restrict, CHF teaching, daily wts were done.
At the time of discharge the pt was euvolemic and did not
require any po lasix daily. He will follow up with his PCP in
the next week to determine if this might be needed in the
future.
.
# Lung Mass: Bronchoscopic biopsy showed squamous cell lung
cancer. Pt was informed of this result and his PCP recommended
that he see Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in oncology, so the pt was
given the phone number to call and make an appointment. He was
instructed to discuss with his PCP if he should see a CT surgeon
for evaluation if this might be a possibility.
.
# AF s/p pacer: HR was initially high, but then was controlled
with diltiazem. This was then changed to Toprol and HR and BP
was in good range. He underwent a head CT to rule out
metastases, and when no mets were seen, he was restarted on
coumadin at his previous dose.
.
# Metabolic alkalosis: it was felt that the pt had a mild volume
contraction given aggressive diuresis in setting of CO2
retention and baseline HCO3 of 30s when outpt.
O2 sats were in the mid 90's on room air and the pt was not
given supplemental oxygen to increase this so that further CO2
retention would occur.
.
# h/o CAD: presumed stable, ruled out for MI in setting of
stress, recent nuclear study within normal limits. He was
started on asa, statin, bb and continue ace-I for secondary
prevention.
.
# Microcytic anemia: stable. New since [**2178-5-24**]. Outpatient
c-scope needed
.
# Wt loss 30lb: stable. Likely due to malignancy.
