Echocardiographic Measurements
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Atrium - Four Chamber Length:  *5.3 cm  <= 5.2 cm
Right Atrium - Four Chamber Length:  *5.4 cm  <= 5.0 cm
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  >= 60%  >= 55%

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. A catheter
or pacing wire is seen in the RA and extending into the RV.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
systolic function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical quality, a
focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Moderate global RV free
wall hypokinesis.

AORTIC VALVE: Bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis (AVR).

GENERAL COMMENTS: Echocardiographic results were reviewed by
Conclusions
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal with moderately depressed
free wall contractility. A well-seated bioprosthetic aortic
valve prosthesis is present. There is a 1.5-2.0cm echogenic
filled space anterior to the right ventricle and left ventricle
which appears similar to the pre-operative images of [**2158-2-28**] and
likely represents epicardial fat.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted the day of surgery, taken to the OR for AVR (tissue)
and raplacement of ascending aorta & total arch (please see
operative note for details of procedure). Post-op, she was taken
to the ICU on neosynephrine drip for BP support.   Initially,
she required some blood products & IV fluids for labile BP, she
was placed on inotropes for cardiac index.  She was duiresed
over the next few days, and ultimately extubated on POD # 5.
Her pressors & inotropes were also weaned off during those days.
 On POD # 6, a speech/swallow evalutaion was obtained due to
some apparent difficulty swallowing.  She was diagnosed w/mild
to moderate dysphagia, and a diet of ground solids and thin
liquids was ordered.  She was transferred from the ICU to the
telemetry floor later on POD # 6. Her beta blockers were started
and increased, continues with diuresis, and has remained
hemodynamically stable. She remains slow to progress from a
physical therapy standpoint.  She is now ready to be transferred
to a rehab facility to continue with physical therapy &
speech/swallowing therapy.
