Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 1391**] is a 32 year old female with a history of asthma
who presents with shortness of breath consistent with an asthma
exacerbation.

#1 asthma exacerbation: Mrs. [**Known lastname 1391**] recently returned from
[**Country 35188**] and her symptoms began on returning to [**Location (un) 86**], coinciding
with the change in climate.  Other inciting events could include
viral infection, although she had no other symptoms supporting a
URI, and she was ruled out for influenza.  Her eosinophilia on
admission supports the diagnosis of asthma exacerbation.  She
received solumedrol 125 mg Q8H and albuterol nebs at least every
2 hours overnight and her symptoms were much improved the
following morning. Pt then transitioned to oral prednisone for 3
days and started on Advair. PE ruled out with low d-dimer.
Outpt pulmonology appt scheduled.  Patient was counseled to call
her primary care physician immediately if she began to develop
any difficulty breathing in order to best avoid a repeat severe
asthma exacerbation.

#2 fevers: The patient reported one fever at her home and other
subjective fevers.  She was afebrile in the ED and in the ICU.
An infectious cause was initially considered given her recent
travel to [**Country 35188**], however, she has had no fevers or other
infectious symptoms since admission.  She was ruled out for
influenza.

#3 arthralgias/myalgias: again concerning for viral infection.
She also complained of neck pain and mild photophobia, although
given that she has had no fevers or mental status changes
concern for CNS infection was low.

#4 chest pain: The patient also complained of chest pain that
was pleuritic in nature, worse with inspiration and coughing,
and reproducible by palpation, likely musculoskeletal in nature.
 EKG was unconcerning for ischemia. Cardiac enzymes were
negative x1.

#5 abd pain: The patient is s/p cholecystectomy for gallstones.
Abd pain is diffuse and mild, only present upon palpation. LFTs,
pancreatic enzymes normal.  The patient is currently having her
period and was ordered ibuprofen per her home regimen for
menstrual cramps.

#6 BPPV:  patient had episodes of vertigo and dizziness the day
prior to discharge.  Was exacerbated by left gazing [**Last Name (un) **]-Hallpike
maneuver, neuro exam consistent with BPPV.  Pt. was given
Meclizine which made the patient feel subjectively better, and
had no further episodes the day of discharge.  Was given a home
prescription for meclizine.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 1391**],

You were admitted for a serious exacerbation of your asthma.  We
have changed your asthma medications in order to prevent repeat
exacerbations and hospitalizations.

You will now be taking Advair twice per day and singulair.  You
can still use your albuterol nebulizers and inhalers, but you do
not need to continue the flovent inhaler as this drug is
included in advair. You should continue to take all of your
other medications as you did previously.  In addition, we have
started you on a drug called meclizine -- please continue to
take as indicated if you begin to have episodes of vertigo.

Please keep the appointments listed below.  If you again develop
serious difficulty breathing, please contact your primary care
doctor immediately.
