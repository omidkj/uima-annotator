ADDENDUM:  The expected date of discharge, which was
originally that of [**2191-11-15**], the patient was found to
be lethargic, not responsive to voice, but responsive to
painful stimulus.  A chest x-ray was performed.  This was
shown to be unchanged from prior x-ray on the [**12-9**]
that showed large bilateral pleural effusion as well as
severe pulmonary edema.  Arterial blood gas showed a pH of
7.37, PCO2 of 52 and PO2 of 158 on 100% nonrebreather.  Her
oxygen saturation was 98%.  It was thought that her lethargy
was secondary to hypercarbia.  The patient's son was notified
of her decreased mental status and it was decided to not
pursue any aggressive measures including thoracentesis or
intubation.  In fact with no treatment the patient improved
and her mental status gradually returned to baseline by that
evening.

On the following day the [**11-16**] the patient was at
baseline mental status and was discharged to rehabilitation.

There were several changes in her discharge medications.
First her Coumadin was decreased to 2 mg po q.h.s.  This was
done, because her INR on the day of discharge was 3.3.  The
goal INR is from 2.0 to 3.0.  In addition, her Digoxin was
decreased to 0.125 mg po q.d.  Due to her low sodium level
the patient should have daily fluid restrictions to
approximately 750 cc po.

She is discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation.
