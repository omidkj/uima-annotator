History of Present Illness:
59yo woman with recently diagnosed renal cell cancer with brain
metastases diagnosed by MRI [**11-14**], presented with a prolonged
seizure at home. Per her husband, she has had no c/o recently
including f/c/cp/sob/gu/gi sx; she was supposed to have a
radiology study and mask fitting in preparation for cyberknife
procedure the morning of admission. Her husband woke up at 4am
and heard some commotion from living room - he walked in to find
the patient standing up, nodding her head up and to the right,
rhythmically, with eye deviation to the right, some blinking
(?rhythmic), not talking. He changed her clothes and helped her
into the car, then drove her to the hospital. Along the way, he
asked her if she could squeeze his hand, and she periodically
gave weak squeezes on command. When she arrived at [**Hospital1 **] (5AM) she
was not following commands, and rhythmic eye-blinking was noted,
with R eye deviation; she received 6mg total ativan, with some
effect (and was following commands again), and given 1gm PHT
load.

Past Medical History:
renal cell cancer diagnosed in [**8-26**] with a left renal mass,
presented with LE swelling. Now s/p L nephrectomy and
adrenalectomy [**9-26**], pathology showing renal cell. On [**2187-11-14**]

[**Male First Name (un) 28447**] club/sales, quit tob 30 yrs ago, formerly smoked <1pd x 10
yrs, former etoh, no drugs, no toxic exposures

spontaneously (not rhythmically at this point), staring
straight, but can track on command and follow commands to
squeeze hand wiggle toes, close eyes; no speech heard

Cranial Nerves: Blinks to threat bilat, optic discs are normal
in appearance, eye movements are normal with tracking and with
OCR (both vertical and horizontal), no nystagmus.  Pupils
slightly anisocoric (<0.5mm difference, L>R) but both briskly
reactive to light; No obvious facial asymmetry with grimace,
intact corneals; Hearing is intact to voice. The palate elevates
in the midline. The tongue protrudes in the midline and is of
normal appearance.

Sensorimotor: Pt w/d vigorously all 4 ext to stim, squeezes
hands and wiggles toes, but did not raise legs off bed.

Reflexes: The tendon reflexes are brisk throughout, slightly
brisker on the right than the left. The plantar reflexes are
flexor.

Gait, coord could not be tested.

Imaging:
CXR: No evidence of pneumonia or CHF. Redemonstration of
numerous pulmonary lesions consistent with the patient's known
metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
.
Head CT [**11-26**]: There is a 14 mm ovoid hyperdense focus in the
left frontal lobe, consistent with hemorrhage at the site of the
patient's known metastatic lesion. This focus appears slightly
larger than on prior examination. There is also a significant
increase in hypodensity in the surrounding left frontal lobe
consistent with edema. This edema is compressing the frontal
[**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle. There is slight shift of
normally midline structures to the right, as shown by subfalcine
herniation. No new areas of hemorrhage are identified. There is
no hydrocephalus. The osseous and soft tissue structures are
unremarkable.
.
MRI Head [**11-26**]:
The metastasis in the superior left frontal lobe is again
demonstrated.  It appears to have increased in size compared to
[**2187-11-14**].  For example, on the sagittal images, it has increased
from approximately 12 mm to 16 mm in oblique superior/inferior
dimension.  There is more anterior extension of edema as well.
.
There is now a second punctate lesion in the left cerebellar
hemisphere with surrounding edema, as discussed by the radiology
residents with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 42460**] on [**11-27**].
.
The other small areas of FLAIR hyperintensity present on the
current study
were present previously and no underlying enhancing lesions are
seen, most
consistent with small vessel disease.  There is new mass effect
on the left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] from the left frontal metastasis and
edema.  The cerebellar edema does not affect the fourth
ventricle.  As seen previously, there is a degree of
ventriculomegaly.  The craniovertebral junction is normal.
.
IMPRESSION:
1.  There is a second punctate enhancing lesion in the left
cerebellum with surrounding edema, new since10/25 and most
consistent with a second
metastasis.
2.  A left frontal lesion appears to have enlarged from
approximately 12 to approximately 16 mm since [**11-14**] and there is
slightly more surrounding edema with new mass effect on the left
frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**].
.
EEG [**11-27**]:
ABNORMALITY #1: Sharp and slow wave complexes over the left
anterior quadrant occurred during wakefulness with a frequency
of 0.5-1 Hz.  During these discharges, the patient was able to
follow simple commands, but was unable to state the date
appropriately.
BACKGROUND: A 9.5 Hz posterior predominant rhythm was recorded
in the waking state, which attenuated with eye opening. The
normal anterior to
posterior voltage gradient was observed.
HYPERVENTILATION: Contraindicated.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Portable study precluded photic
testing.
SLEEP: The patient remained awake throughout the recording. No
state I or II sleep was recorded.
CARDIAC MONITOR: A generally regular rhythm was recorded, with
an average rate of 90 beats per minute.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal EEG in the waking state due to
the periodic sharp and slow wave complexes in the left anterior
quadrant occuring at a frequency of 0.5-1 Hz. No seizures were
recorded.


Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: 58yo woman with RCC with metastases to the brain,
who presented with a prolonged seizure likely to be focal motor
partial status. The seizure focus was felt to be her L frontal
lobe lesion, which was consistent with her symptoms and EEG
findings. She was given 6mg ativan and 1gm dilantin in the ED
with resolution of her symptoms. She was started on decadron in
the ED and continued on this throughout her hospital stay at 4
mg PO Q6.  She was initially admitted to the ICU for close
monitoring. An EEG showed L frontal spikes occuring
approximately every 5 seconds. She slowly improved over the
course of the next several days, with persistent non-fluent
aphasia with preserved repetition. She was continued on dilantin
with keppra added for more long term seizure prophylaxis (goal
to wean pt of Dilantin and titrate up Keppra on an outpatient
basis).  As her exam improved she was transferred to the floor.
.
She had an MRI by c
