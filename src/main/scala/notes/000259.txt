CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Blurry vision.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 66-year-old woman
with a history of hypertension who presented to [**Hospital3 6265**] on [**2199-2-15**] with blurry vision,
lightheadedness, and unsteady gait. A MRI done on [**2199-2-16**] demonstrated multiple small infarcts in the cerebellar
hemisphere, left occipital, medial, left temporal lobe
consistent with embolic events. A transesophageal
echocardiogram demonstrated a large myxoma of the left
atrium,  and she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
At the outside hospital, she was anticoagulated and otherwise
remained stable.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for dyslipidemia,
borderline hypertension.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Include MVI.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother has a history of hypertension. Father
had history of asthma.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No EtOH. Remote history of smoking. She
lives at home with her husband.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Temperature is 97.3, heart rate 79, blood
pressure 150/46. She is [**Age over 90 **]% on room air. She is in no acute
distress, appearing well. There is no JVD. No carotid bruits.
Heart is regular with no murmurs. Her lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended. She has 2+ distal pulses with no edema in the
extremities. She is alert and oriented times three and
demonstrated a nonfocal neurologic exam.

Laboratory values include a white count of 3.7, hematocrit of
31, platelets of 182. INR was 1.1. BUN was 10, creatinine was
0.7. Rest of her labs were unremarkable.

For imaging studies, she had a MRI done on [**2199-2-16**],
which demonstrated multiple small acute and subacute infarcts
in the cerebellar hemispheres, left occipital lobe, the left
medial/left temporal lobe, the left thalamus, and the right
midbrain consistent with shower embolic infarcts in the
posterior circulation. No hemorrhage.

She also had a TEE on [**2199-2-18**] which demonstrated a 3 cm
x 3 cm mass extending from the high intra-atrial septum of
the left atrium. There is no prolapse to the mitral valve. It
is multilobular and very mobile. It does not extend across
the intra-atrial septum. There was good left ventricular
function.

She had underwent cardiac catheterization which demonstrated
normal coronary arteries, normal cardiac index.

Echocardiogram done [**2199-2-19**] here demonstrated an EF of
60%, a mass in the left atrium, normal wall motion.

Chest x-ray had no congestion and no infiltrate.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  After her workup by the neurology service,
the stroke service, the cardiology team, and cardiac surgery
team, patient was taken to the operating room on [**2199-2-21**], where she underwent an atrial myxoma removal and
primary repair of intra-atrial septum. She tolerated this
procedure well.

She postoperatively was transferred to the cardiac surgery
intensive care unit. Patient was extubated, remained
hemodynamic normal. Was weaned off all pressors. She was
transferred to the floor on postoperative day #1. After
removal of tubes and wires, she was anticoagulated with
Coumadin. Postoperatively, she did have a right hand
thrombophlebitis from an old IV site which was monitored and
treated with a course of Keflex. She was seen by physical
therapy and has passed a level 5 evaluation. She has been
stable and is now ready for discharge to home, where she will
be anticoagulated and followed by her primary cardiologist.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Embolic stroke.

Left atrial myxoma.

Hypertension.

Right hand thrombophlebitis.

Hypercholesterolemia.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. Aspirin 81 mg daily.
3. Percocet 5/325 [**11-18**] p.o. q.4h. p.r.n.
4. Keflex 500 mg 1 q.6. x7 days.
5. Lasix 20 mg p.o. daily for 10 days.
6. Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. daily for 10 days.
7. Coumadin 2 mg per day and this will be adjusted according
   to an INR level and discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 61120**].


DISPOSITION:  The patient is being discharged home with VNA
services who will monitor wound healing and assess
cardiopulmonary status. Encourage ambulation and check INR on
[**2-28**] and [**3-4**]. Results will be called to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 61120**]
at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 61121**].

She will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 61120**] in 2 weeks. Call for an
