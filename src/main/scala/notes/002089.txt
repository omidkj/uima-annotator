Admission Date:  [**2147-2-11**]       Discharge Date:  [**2147-2-20**]

Date of Birth:   [**2068-3-18**]       Sex:  F

Service:  MICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78-year-old
female with multiple medical problems who comes to us from
[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 34648**] for respiratory distress and hypotension.

She has been on a tracheostomy since [**2146-9-28**] when she
had a coronary artery bypass graft at an outside hospital and
had failure to wean.  She was transferred to [**Hospital **]
Rehabilitation for ventilatory weaning and was given the
diagnosis of tracheobronchomalacia and had two stents placed
in the distal trachea and left main stent.  These stents are
made of silicone.

On the day prior to admission, the patient developed
respiratory distress, shortness of breath, cyanosis, and
hypoxia.  Her ventilator settings at that time were assist
control with a tidal volume of 600, a respiratory rate of 12,
an FIO2 of 0.5, and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 6.
This resulted in an arterial blood gas with a pH of 7.12, a
carbonate dioxide of 104, and an O2 of 36.

She arrived to [**Hospital1 69**] alert.
She was being bagged through her tracheostomy and was
hemodynamically stable.  She had an urgent bronchoscopy, as
the original thought was that perhaps her stents had been
displaced causing blockage and hypoxia.  The bronchoscopy
showed that her stents were in place.  Instead, she had
significant mucous plugging (greater on the left).  These
were removed with some difficulty.  Subsequently, her
clinical status improved, and she was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit for followup and stabilization.

 1.  Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial
infarction and coronary artery bypass graft in [**2146-9-28**] at [**Hospital6 1708**].

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN and INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a 40-pack-year smoking
history.  She recently quit smoking.  One to two alcoholic
drinks per day.  She lives with sister [**Female First Name (un) 123**] in [**Name (NI) 1559**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Examination on
admission revealed vital signs with a temperature of 97.1
degrees Fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 106/43 (on a
Levophed drip), her heart rate was 92, her respiratory rate
was 17, and her oxygen saturation was 100% on assist control
with a tidal volume of 450, respiratory rate 18, FIO2 of 0.7,
and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5.  The patient was
intubated and sedated with equal and symmetric pupils that
were minimally reactive.  She had moist mucous membranes.
Her neck was a difficult examination as the tracheostomy
collar was in place.  Her heart was regular.  There were no
murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.  Lungs prior to the
urgent bronchoscopy revealed decreased air movement on the
right with minimal breath sounds on the left.  Status post
bronchoscopy, there was improved air movement bilaterally.
The abdomen was soft, slight distended, with no
hepatosplenomegaly.  There were positive bowel sounds.  There
was a vertical scar.  Extremity examination revealed
extremities which were cool distally with dopplerable distal
pulses.  No edema or clubbing.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Initial
laboratories revealed her white blood cell count was 6.5, her
hematocrit was 31.7, and her platelets were 298.  Sodium was
143, potassium was 4.7, chloride was 107, bicarbonate was 31,
blood urea nitrogen was 37, creatinine was 0.9, and her blood
glucose was 194.  Her liver function tests were normal with
an alkaline phosphatase of 150 and a total bilirubin of 0.2.
Her albumin was 2.4.  Her calcium was 7.4, her phosphate was
5.5, and her magnesium was 2.3.  Creatine kinase was 27.  Her
troponin was pending.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray showed
hyperinflation on the right with left main stem with discrete
cutoff prior to the bronchoscopy.

An electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm with no
acute ischemic changes.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

 1.  RESPIRATORY FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient had respiratory
failure that was thought to be secondary to mucous bronchial
plugging as well as pneumonia.   Status post bronchoscopy,
her arterial blood gas levels markedly improved.   In
addition, she markedly improved with appropriate antibiotic
use.

Two days prior to discharge, the patient was on assist
control with a tidal volume of 550, respiratory rate of 15,
with two spontaneous breaths per minute, an FIO2 of 50%, and
a positive end-expiratory pressure of 8.  Her oxygen
saturations were in the mid 90s, and her arterial blood gas
levels were appropriate.

 2.  PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  Originally, the patient was kept on
her original antibiotics including linezolid and
levofloxacin.  Subsequently, sputum cultures grew out
Klebsiella and Serratia which were sensitive to ceftriaxone.
Levaquin was continued for double coverage of Serratia.  A
10-day course of these antibiotics is anticipated with the
date of completion for both the clindamycin and ceftriaxone
being on [**2-25**].  The patient was continued on
linezolid, and blood cultures were taken which were negative.
Given the fact that we had a source of Serratia and
Klebsiella in the sputum with no evidence of positive blood
cultures, linezolid was discontinued.  The antibiotics that
the organisms were sensitive were started.

 3.  HYPOTENSION/SHOCK ISSUES:  Initially, the patient came
to us with a low blood pressure with required a Levophed drip
to be maintained.  She remained on the Levophed drip for
approximately four days into her admission.  Different
pressors including dobutamine and dopamine were used, but
discontinued due to side effects of tachypnea, tachycardia,
and vasodilation.

An echocardiogram was performed which showed an ejection
fraction of 25% to 30% with 3+ mitral regurgitation and 2+
tricuspid regurgitation.

The source of her hypotension was thought to be two-fold; one
cardiogenic and the second reason was thought to be related
to septicemia.  With treatment of her pneumonia with
antibiotics as well as initiation of digoxin, she has been
able to maintain her blood pressures adequately without the
need for pressors.   At the time of discharge, she had been
off any pressors or drips for greater than four days.

 4.  ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY ISSUES:  The patient came to us on
prednisone.  A cortical stimulation test was performed which
was difficult to interpret due to her baseline levels of
prednisone.  It was decided to start her on stress doses of
steroids for seven days.  She received fludrocortisone by
mouth and hydrocortisone intravenously,
