Brief Hospital Course:
88F with aortic insufficiency, COPD, RA on
prednisone/methotrexate, on coumadin for DVT who was admitted at
2 AM on [**3-22**] for an open mid-shaft spiral tibia fracture
sustained after twisting her ankle while getting into bed. The
patient does not recall the exact mechanism of injury but states
that had no head strike and no LOC.

She was admitted to the Orthopaedic Trauma Service for repair of
an open mid-shaft spiral tibia fracture .  The patient was taken
to the OR and underwent an uncomplicated washout and debridement
of the open fracture, operative treatment of left tibia shaft
fracture with intramedullary nail, and closed treatment of the
left fibula fracture without manipulation.

The patient tolerated the procedure without complications, was
extubated without difficulty and was transferred to the PACU in
stable condition.  Please refer to the operative report for
details of the case.  However while in the PACU she became
hypotensive with a pressor requirement and was transferred to
the ICU post op for management.  She responded well to PRBC
transfusion and to pressor and her BP had improved on arrival to
the ICU. Pressors were turned off at 3 PM on the day of surgery
([**2102-3-24**]) and she remained stable for the remainder of her
hospitalization. During her hospitalization she was also noted
to have a decrease in platelet count, workup revealed that she
was HIT antibody NEGATIVE and her platelet count stabilized and
slowly began to increase.

Post operatively pain was controlled with IV pain medication
with a transition to PO pain meds once tolerating POs.  The
patient tolerated diet advancement without difficulty and made
steady progress with PT, however was found to benefit most from
discharge to rehab.


Weight bearing status: Weight bearing as tolerated in bivalve
cast .

The patient received peri-operative antibiotics as well as
Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.  The incision was clean, dry, and
intact without evidence of erythema or drainage; and the
extremity was NVI distally throughout.  The patient was
discharged in stable condition with written instructions
concerning precautionary instructions and the appropriate
follow-up care.  The patient will be continued on chemical DVT
prophylaxis for 4 weeks post-operatively.  All questions were
answered prior to discharge and the patient expressed readiness
for discharge.
