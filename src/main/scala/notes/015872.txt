Date of Birth:  [**2080-9-11**]             Sex:   M

Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Spironolactone / Radioactive Diagnostics, General Classif

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Recurrent angina

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Third time redo coronary artery bypass
grafting x2 with a free right internal mammary artery from
the diagonal graft vein [**Doctor Last Name **] to the left anterior descending
coronary artery. Reverse cephalic vein from the aorta to the
first diagonal coronary artery.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 80-year-old gentleman who 24
years ago underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. Twelve
years ago he underwent redo coronary artery bypass grafting
which was quite extensive. Upon entering the chest, the
patent mammary artery to diagonal was transected. At that
time, he had a Y vein graft to the diagonal and left anterior
descending coronary artery as well as a vein graft to the
posterior descending coronary artery. The patient did well
for many years but has recurrent angina. The patient has also
had multiple stenting of both his native circulation and vein
grafts and most recently had an intervention to the Y vein
graft which was not successful. The patient had recurrent
angina and was therefore referred for third time redo bypass
surgery.

Social History:
Married, retired owner of a furniture store.


Family History:
Mother had heart disease with a mild MI in her 60's.

Physical Exam:
Physical examination in my office revealed a blood pressure of
130/70 with a pulse of 70 and regular and respirations of 18.
In
general, he was very pleasant elderly male in no acute distress,
somewhat obese and mildly short of breath.  His skin was notable
to have a radiation burn on his back as well as multiple well
healed incisions.  His oropharynx was benign.  He was
edentulous,
but with full dentures.  His neck was supple with full range of
motion.  There was no JVD.  His lungs were mostly clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  His heart had a regular rate and
rhythm, normal S1 and S2, and a soft systolic ejection murmur
was
best heard over the aortic region.  His abdomen was obese,
somewhat firm, but nontender with normoactive bowel sounds.  His
extremities were warm with 1 to 2+ edema bilaterally.  He did
have venostasis and rubor changes noted bilaterally.  In
evaluating his greater saphenous vein, he had multiple incisions
on his leg.  The only remaining greater saphenous vein segments
did appear to be at his ankles.  Neurologically, he was alert
and
oriented x3.  His cranial nerves II through XII were grossly
intact.  He moved all extremities with full range of motion and
had 5/5 strength.  His femoral pulses were absent as well as his
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis bilaterally.  His radial
pulses were 2+.  His carotid pulses were 1+ bilaterally and it
did appear that he did have a soft bruit.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 106785**] was brought to the operating room on [**4-9**].  He was
transfused 1 unit of PRBC postoperatively.  He was extubated
Friday POD#1 and maintained on 6L face tent.  He was transfused
two more units of PRBC for a hct in the low 20s which rose
appropriately to 30.  He had CI between [**2-22**] and blood pressure
was maintained on low dose epinephrine.  Overnight on Friday he
developed a lactic acidosis to 10 which resolved by morning with
weaning of the epinephrine.  POD #2 he again required pressors
for hypotension.  Gradually he developed respiratory distress
and was intubated later in the evening.  He also stopped making
urine and his creatinine rose to 3.2.  His lactic acidosis
returned and his lactate was 10 by Sunday morning. He was also
requiring 3 pressors.  Because of intestinal ischemia concern he
was brought to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy
which was negative.  An intra-operative echo showed poor right
ventricular function.  He was subsequently brought to the cath
lab to rule out an occluded right bypass graft. All coronaries
were normal but again right ventricular function was poor.  He
continued doing poorly Sunday.  Oxygenation was maintained with
a high peep.  Adequate preload was ensured with colloid
transfusions.  CVVH was initiated and acidosis controlled with
bicarb dialysate.  Cardiac index gradually diminished to below
2.  Bladder pressures rose to mid 30s and his abdomen was
opened. This did not significantly affect hemodynamics. Lactate
rose to 20 by Monday morning.  His chest was opened but also
resulted in no improvement.  Patient expired later that morning.
