Service:  [**Hospital1 **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old man
with a year-old chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
coronary artery disease, status post myocardial infarction,
congestive heart failure, EF of 40% and morbid obesity with
increasing shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion and
increasing abdominal girth.  The patient was seen by his
primary care physician and Lasix was increased to 80 mg once
a day to 80 mg po b.i.d.  The patient had increased dyspnea
on exertion and decreased urine output subsequently.  He
denied at that time no rales or peripheral edema.  The
patient had increasing lightheadedness and presented to his
primary care physician for follow up with a blood pressure of
74/40 and a heart rate of 110.

In the Emergency Department the patient's blood pressure was
81/55, heart rate of 98, creatinine 5.4, and afebrile.
Central line was placed and the patient was started on a
Dopamine drip.  The patient responded to 2.5 liters of normal
saline bolus and pressors and sent to the MICU.

In the MICU the patient was weaned off the Dopamine drip.  A
Swans Ganz catheter was placed, which showed evidence of
pulmonary hypertension, PA pressures were 50/17, RV pressure
35/10, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 16.  CVP was 15
to 23.  The patient was then transferred to the Medicine
Floor once blood pressures were stable.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, FVC of 2.45 71%
predicted, FEV1 1.45 60% of predicted and FEV1/FVC ratio 84%
of predicted.
2.  Congestive heart failure with an EF of 40% in [**10/2123**]
with inferolateral akinesis.
3.  History of myocardial infarction in [**2118**].
4.  Obstructive sleep apnea on BiPAP.
5.  Prostate cancer status post radiation therapy in [**2123**].
6.  Gout.
7.  Cellulitis.
8.  Obesity.
9.  History of seizures in [**2118**].
10.  Hernia repair.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aspirin.
2.  Albuterol.
3.  Asthmacort.
4.  Flomax.
5.  Lasix 80 b.i.d.
6.  Lisinopril 10 mg once a day.
7.  Ipratropium.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Quit smoking one year ago.  Smoked three
packs per week for 24 years.  Drinks one and a half pints of
Vodka per week.  The patient lives alone.  Denies any
recreational drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON TRANSFER TO THE MEDICINE FLOOR:
Temperature 98.6.  Blood pressure 112/68.  Pulse 90.
Respiratory rate 24.  Oxygen saturation 97% on room air.
General examination this is an obese gentleman with a hoarse
voice and a cushingoid appearance.  Neck is plethoric with a
right sided hematoma and a buffalo hump.  Cardiovascular
heart sounds are distant, but otherwise regular rate and
rhythm.  Pulmonary decreased breath sounds bilaterally.
Abdomen is obese, soft, nontender, nondistended with evidence
of stria.  Extremities the patient has clubbing.  Arms and
legs are thin.  Neurological examination cranial nerves II
through XII are grossly intact.  The patient has 5 out of 5
strength in all four extremities.  The patient has no
dysdiadochokinesia.  Sensation is grossly intact.

LABORATORIES ON TRANSFER:  White blood cell count 6.5,
hematocrit 33.3, creatinine 4.2.  TSH 1.2.  Echocardiogram EF
of 55%.  Renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis.
Abdominal ultrasound showed no ascites.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the [**Hospital6 22258**] after transfer from the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient's blood pressure remained stable during his
hospital course.  The patient was transferred with a heparin
drip.  The patient was ruled out for pulmonary embolism and
deep venous thrombosis by VQ scan and lower extremity
dopplers.  Other sources of pulmonary hypertension was
evaluated, but was unrevealing.  It was thought that the
patient's pulmonary hypertension was secondary to obstructive
sleep apnea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The patient remained dyspneic while on the Medicine Floor.
However, the patient's oxygen saturation was good.  The
patient became increasingly dyspneic after mild exertion such
as going to the bathroom.  The patient was empirically
treated with steroids for possible chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease flare in addition to Azithromycin.  The
patient did not respond to this course of treatment.

The patient was to be in prerenal failure.  The patient was
aggressively treated with intravenous fluids and the
patient's creatinine trended downwards to 2.0.  The patient's
Lasix was held during this time.

Based on clinical findings and stigmata of [**Location (un) 3484**] disease
a 24 hour urine Cortisol and ACTH were measured.  The results
of these tests showed no evidence of [**Location (un) 3484**] disease.

The patient was anemic with a hematocrit in the mid 30s.  The
patient's hematocrit gradually dwindled in the hospital
course.  This was most likely secondary to a dilutional
effects.  No evidence of bleeding was noted other then small
right neck hematoma.  This was at the site of the cortis
during the patient's Intensive Care Unit stay.  Also during
the hospital course the patient developed intermittent
epistaxis.  As per the patient was associated with his BiPAP
machine, but often occurred spontaneously.  Ear, nose and
throat was consulted to evaluate the epistaxis.  They
recommended nasal spray and Afrin spray.  The patient's
epistaxis was more controlled after his anticoagulation was
removed when evidence of deep venous thrombosis and PE were
ruled out.

The patient had a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea.  The
patient was given a BiPAP machine to use nightly.  The
patient had difficulty with breathing and was noncompliant
during his hospital course.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Fair.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To rehab.
