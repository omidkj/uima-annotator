Chief Complaint:
RV thrombus seen on echo

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
41yoM with h/o stage IV L tonsillar small cell ca who was
admitted to [**Hospital3 **] last Friday after he lost
consciousness for "two seconds" and had a fall and hurt his L
shoulder. He deneis any CP, palpitations, dizziness, post-ictal
period, b/b incontinence, tongue biting, and knew where he was
immediately after regaining consciousness. He endorses that he
has been dehydrated and has had poor PO due to loss of appetite,
such that he was actually going to be admitted for J tube
placement when this event occurred.
.
At LGH he was 98.1 p104 18 107/67 98%RA. He had several EKG's
which were tachycardic and show S1Q3T3 but no acute ST changes.
Admitted to telemetry unit and ruled out for MI by enzymes and
had normal EKG on admission. Through admission they felt it was
less likely that he had a seizure. He was given IVF's. He then
developed NSVT on day #2, review of the strips shows 5-8 beat
runs, and was started on Amiodarone gtt, changed to PO dose
today. He then had an echo showing large thrombus in RV and is
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management/intervention.
.
Vitals on transfer: 97.9 118/81 81 18. Labs on d/c Na 133, K
4.4, CO2 28, BUN/Cr 9/0.52, BNP 177. His Hct was stable in the
mid 30's, WBC's elevated up to 14, and thrombocytopenic in the
low 100's. Dilantin level low and he was loaded. He had a CT
C-spine concerning for metastases (see report below) and a left
shoulder plain film concerning for mets (see below).
.
ROS is as above, including anorexia, wt loss (225 --> 140 now),
chronic constipation and vomiting, dehydration. Chronic L
shoulder pain.
.
No CP, palpitations, DOE, leg swelling, dizziness.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr [**Known lastname 85005**] is a 41yoM with stage IV L tonsillar small cell
cancer, h/o seizures, who was admitted to LGH for syncopal
episode of unclear etiology and through workup was found to have
RV thrombus vs tumor, who is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.
.
1. RV thrombus vs tumor: Patient underwent gated CT chest that
was revealing for likely thrombus in RV, PE, and pulmonary
infarcts.  LENIs were negative for DVTs bilaterally.  He was
initially treated with heparin gtt and then transitioned to
lovenox.  CT surgery evaluated patient.  Patient remained
hemodynamically stable and so thrombolytics and surgery was not
pursued.  Patient expressed that he wanted to go home and did
not want to stay in the hospital.  His outpatient oncologists
was contact[**Name (NI) **] who stated that patient was a candidate for
palliative chemotherapy and confirmed that he has progressive
malignancy with poor response to chemo/radiation.  Patient was
discharged with lovenox.
- Patient will need repeat echocardiogram within 3 weeks.
- Continue lovenox
.
2. Syncopal episode: Likely related to RV thrombus and PE.
Amiodarone, which wsas started at OSH for NSVT was stopped.
Patient had 3-4 beats of NSVT on telemetry but otherwise no
arrythmia.  A head CT was done and was negative for metastasis.
Her outpt oncologist confirmed that MRI head did not show
evidence of metastasis.
.
3. Stage IV tonsillar small cell carcinoma: Diagnosed about a
year ago and is s/p chemo and radiation finished in [**12/2115**], no
surgery. Already metastatic. Discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 22658**] at LGH;
patient candidate for palliative chemotherapy and is also
undergoing evaluation for surgical intervention of skull based
met for palliation.
.
4. Nutrition: S/p J tube placement [**2116-6-5**] due to persistent
n/v and decreased PO intake, likely due to the malignancy,
although further w/u for this is not noted in OSH reports.
Patient tolerating tube feeds in house.
.
.
5. Leukocytosis: Likely related to PE, stress rx to thrombus.
No evidence of infection.
.
6. Thrombocytopenia: No clear etiology. OSH was 104 and is high
90's here. DDx including drug effect (Heparin, does not appear
pt received ABx at OSH), metastases to BM. No evidence of
bleeding or unstable Hct.  Unlikely to be HIT; could be related
to consumption secondary to underlying clot.  He does have
repeat labs two days following discharge for repeat PLT check
which will be faxed to Dr[**Name (NI) 85006**] office.
.
7.  Dilantin was continued for his seizure history.
.
8.  Left shoulder pain: Concerning lesions on x-ray for
metastasis; will require further outpatient follow up.
.
9.  Pain control - Mr [**Known lastname 85005**] is being sent home with a small
supply of Dilaudid in addition to lyrica, methadone,
desipramine, and flexeril.
