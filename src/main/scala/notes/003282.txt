to ED for IV fluids, blood cultures, CXR, antibiotics.  In ED,
initially, SBPs >100, but SBPs dropped to 70s upon standing for
CXR.  Got IVFs, BP unresponsive, so sepsis line placed and
started on neosynephrine. Asymptomatic throughout.  CXR showed
RLL PNA, so pt. was started on ceftriaxone/azithromycin.
Lactate 2.3-->1.8.  Pt. got cardiology consult in ED, who

CXR [**10-4**]: 1. Right IJ CVL tip within the mid SVC. No evidence of
pneumothorax.
2. Developing right lower lobe pneumonia

CXR [**10-8**]:In comparison with the study of [**10-6**], there is again
an area of increased opacification at the right base medially
consistent with the clinical impression of pneumonia. This
appears to be less prominent than on the previous examination.

The right central catheter has been removed.


Brief Hospital Course:
70yo with chronic Afib with hypotension and afib with RVR,
likely pneumonial sepsis
.
# Afib with RVR: It was felt to be likely an exacerbation
secondary to infection. Her TSH was normal. Given her
hypotension, we initially avoided diltiazem and beta blockade.
She was digoxin loaded for rate control with good effect, and as
blood pressure increased, changed to beta blocade with
uptitration of metoprolol. Cardiology recommended against
amiodarone given thyroid toxicity. Upon transfer to the floor
her metoprolol was further uptitrated to the maximum dose of
450mg per day. While her blood pressure remained stable in the
100s/60s, her HR continued to be in the 120's with increases to
140-150 upon ambulation. She was again digoxin loaded and begun
on a standing dose of 0.125mg daily. This controlled her HR well
and allowed her metoprolol to be decreased to 100mg PO TID. She
restarted on her coumadin at 5mg but her INR became
supratherapeutic, likely in conjuction with the levofloxacin.
Her coumadin was held and her INR was allowed to drift to
therapeutic levels, after which she was started on 2mg daily
with stabilization of her INR betwen [**1-2**]. this will continue to
be monitored by her PCP and [**Hospital3 **].
.
# Sepsis.  She was nitially treated with IV boluses to keep
CVP>8, maintaining SvO2 >70%, (no dobutamine given tachycardia,
and hct was above 30, and neo for MAPs>65.  Given her infiltrate
on CXR and focal exam, pt. was thought to have
community-acquired pneumonial sepsis and changed from
CTX/Azithromycin to levofloxacin day 1 [**2162-10-4**]. She became HD
stable and was taken of the neosynephrine and the central line
was removed. She was then transfered to the floor. Blood
cultures and sputum cultures were NGTD at the time of discharge.
She became afebrile with stable blood pressures and breathing
comfortably on room air. She was discharged to complete a 14 day
course of levofloxacin with follow up from her PCP/

.
# GI: She developed diarrhea after starting levofloxacin.
C.diff was negative x 2 with resolution of her diarrhea after
several Percocet to control her chronic arthritis pain.

# hypothyroidism: Continued on her home levothyroxine with good
effect.

# hyperlipidemia: continued on her home atorvastatin with good
effect

# Arthritis: continued on home regimen of celebrex, percocet,
valium prn with minimal use and good effect.

# osteopenia: continued on alendronate, calcium, and vitamin D
