Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
 hypoxic respiratory failure


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated prior to transfer

History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 85 y/o M with h/o T cell leukemia, CAD s/p
CABG, CKD, hx of tumor lysis syndrome, COPD, OSA on home BiPap
who presents from OSH intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.
 The patient was admitted at [**Hospital3 **] earlier in the
month for a CAP.  He was treated initially with ceftriaxone and
azithromycin, then transitioned to cefuroxime prior to d/c to
LTAC.  This hospitalization was complicated by [**Last Name (un) **] and hyperK as
well which were treated with IVF and kayexalate.  He was
discharged on 5L NC - at baseline he uses no supplemental O2.
It seems he had a few days of worsening respiratory distress
with mild cough and was sent to [**Hospital3 **].  He was
trialed on Bipap but he failed and was intubated, sedated with
propofol.  Labs showed trop of 0.18, CKMB 4.1, WBC 377, K>12. He
had a temporary right femoral line placed for dialysis for 2
hours and then decision was made to transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for
further care.  Prior to transfer, he was given vanc/zosyn,
lasix, solumedrol 125mg IV x1, and started on heparin for
presumed PE.  Was hypotensive en route to the 80s and started on
norepinephrine, also satting in the 80s on the vent.  When he
arrived 94% on Vent and normotensive.

In the ED, initial VS were not recorded.  He had repeat labs
sent and a CXR/EKG done.  Renal and Heme/Onc were consulted but
had not provided full recommendations at the time of signout.
The patient was given 2grams calcium IV.  On transfer, vitals
were: HR: 93, BP 126/71 - on norepi 0.3, satting 97% on CMV
550/18 100% PEEP 15.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient is intubated and sedated. He
moves all 4 extremities equally.

Brief Hospital Course:
Hospital Course:
This is an 85 y/o M with h/o T cell leukemia, CAD s/p CABG, CKD,
hx of tumor lysis syndrome, COPD, OSA on home BiPap who presents
from OSH with hypoxic respiratory failure and shock of unclear
etiology. Due to the patients rapid decline and multi-system
organ dysfunction, he was made comfort measures only and expired
shortly after extubation and cessation of pressor support. His
family was at his bedside.
.
# Acute hypoxic respiratory failure with ARDS - Unclear
etiology.  CXR revealed hyperinflated lungs with evidence of
pulmonary edema and central venous congestion.  He had a history
of COPD and OSA and a COPD flare may have contributed given the
history of a few days of shortness of breath.  He was recently
hospitalized as well so HCAP considered althought no evidence on
cxr.  ACS is possible given the elevated troponin and and MB
although cardiogenic shock less likely given warm extrmities,
low JVP and nor obvious pulmonary edema. On arrival to the MICU,
he was on 100% FiO2 and PEEP of 15 with PaO2 of 51 showing
significant A-a gradient concerning for shunt. He was continued
on a heparin gtt for treatment of ACS and possible PE given A-a
gradient.  A TTE-bubble study was ordered. Diuresis with
torsemide was started for possible pulmonary edema. He was
started on vancomycin, cefepime and levofloxacin to cover HCAP.
.
# Shock - Likely vasodilatory given presentation - not
consistent with cardiogenic at this time given warm extremities
and low JVP. He was continued on peripheral levophed with goal
MAP > 65. An HD line with VIP port were planned for HD and
pressor support.
.
# Troponin leak - Concern for ischemia vs demand process given
respiratory failure. In setting of [**Last Name (un) **], elevated troponin not
unexpected, however his MB was elevated as well which is more
concerning for cardiac ischemia. A TTE-bubble study was ordered
and cardiac enzymes were planned to be cycled. A cardiac consult
was placed. Coreg was held and a full dose aspirine was
continued.
.
# T cell leukemia/Leukocytosis - WBC of 336.7K.  It appeared
that he had a history of a T cell lymphocytic leukemia but his
definitive diagnosis was not clear. A hematology oncology
consult was urgently placed for possible leukopheresis.
Examination of his blood smear revealed few, if any, blasts were
identified.  In the setting of what apepared to be baseline
renal function, normal electrolytes, uric acid and coags with
the exception of elevated PTT on IV heparin, he had no evidence
of tumor lysis or DIC although fibrinogen was slightly low at
144. Given that his smear showed mature lymphocytes, it was felt
unlikely that leukostasis would have occured until the WBC >
400K and therefore not the cause of his acute respiratory
failure. His tymor lysis labs were planned to be trended. Of
note, later on repeat CBC, his WBC was 471.7K.
.
# Comfort Measures: On arrival to the MICU, the patients
clinical course rapidly declined, his A-a gradient widened,
shock worsened despite initial rescussitation efforts outlined
above.  After discussi
