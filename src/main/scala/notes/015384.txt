Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old gentleman
with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who was
transferred from an outside hospital to [**Hospital1 190**] for acute management of a submassive pulmonary
embolism.  Three [**Known lastname **] prior to admission the patient
developed increasing right calf pain that was sudden in onset
while walking that increased with weight bearing.  The
patient also noticed a right lower extremity edema below the
knee.  On the [**Known lastname **] of admission he experienced a sudden onset
of shortness of breath with minor exertion and associated
cough that occasionally produced a yellow sputum.  He denied
any chest pain, chest discomfort, hemoptysis, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, diaphoresis, syncope.  He also denied any
recent trauma.  The patient drove himself to the [**Hospital 1474**]
Hospital for further treatment of his shortness of breath.
While at [**Hospital1 1474**] it was noted his temperature was 100.2
Fahrenheit.  An arterial blood gas showed 7.49/35/67 while he
was saturating at 92% on room air.  A right lower extremity
ultrasound revealed an extensive DVT from the popliteal vein
cephalad to include the common femoral vein.  A stat chest CT
showed a massive pulmonary embolism with a saddle embolus
extending across the bifurcation of both the right and left
pulmonary artery with extensive emboli throughout both lower
lobes.  The was started on a heparin drip and emergently
transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] for
further evaluation.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient denies any prior history of
cancer.  He has no history of blood clots.  He also has no
history of cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction or
diabetes mellitus.  It should be noted that the patient
states that recently he has been extremely depressed and he
has been lying in bed for lengthy period of time because he
has not been able to get the energy or motivation to do
things.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Hypertension.  2. Hyperlipidemia.
3. Bipolar disorder for which he has received treatment for
the past five to six years.  4. Cholecystitis two years ago.
5. Acute renal failure two years ago secondary to a decreased
p.o. intake.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  1. Tonsillectomy as a child.  2.
Right cartilage excision secondary to leg swelling 10-12
years ago.

10 mg q.d.  3. Lovastatin 20 mg q.d.  4. Tegretol 200 mg
t.i.d.  5. Olanzapine 5-15 mg q.h.s. p.r.n.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Father has a history of Alzheimer's.  He
died from pneumonia and stroke.  His mother has a history of
atherosclerosis and died at the age of 75.  No known history
of cancer or clotting disorders in the family.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies smoking.  He also denies
intravenous drug use.  In the past he abused alcohol.  He is
married living with his second wife.  [**Name (NI) **] has five children
from his first marriage and three children from his current
spouse.  [**Name (NI) **] is a former military veteran and he receives most
of his care at the Veteran's Hospital.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure was 117/72, pulse
98, respiratory rate 28, temperature 99.2, oxygen saturation
99% on three liters.  In general he is a fatigued elderly
gentleman in minor respiratory distress.  He was alert and
oriented to person, place and situation.  Heart:  Regular
rate and rhythm with distant heart sounds secondary to
hyperexpansion of the lungs.  There were no murmurs, gallops,
or rubs appreciated.  Lungs:  He had decreased breath sounds
at the right base with an occasional expiratory wheeze.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, normal active bowel sounds.  There
was no hepatosplenomegaly.  He had bilateral bulging flanks.
Extremities:  Right lower extremity edema from the knee
distal.  His right lower extremity was slightly erythematous
and warm.  No cords could be appreciated.  There was no
cyanosis or clubbing and he had +2 dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Sodium 138, potassium 4.0, chloride 102,
bicarbonate 25, BUN 20, creatinine 1.4, glucose 113.  His
white blood cell count was 8.9.  His hematocrit was 37.9,
platelet count 244, PT 13.1, PTT 22.3 and an INR was 1.2.
His initial cardiac enzymes showed a CK of 256, a CK MB of
4.4, a troponin of 2.9.

EKG on presentation showed sinus tachycardia with a slight PR
prolongation.  There was a normal axis.  There was T wave
inversion and Q wave in lead 3.  There were no other ST or T
wave inversions noted.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 67-year-old gentleman with a
history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, no past history of
DVT, who presented to an outside hospital and was found to
have a submassive pulmonary embolism.  He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for further management.

1. Pulmonary embolism:  Upon admission the patient was given
a bedside echocardiogram which revealed the left ventricular
cavity was mildly dilated.  Overall left ventricular systolic
function was unable to be assessed.  The right ventricular
cavity was moderately dilated and the right ventricular
systolic function appeared to be depressed.  A repeat
echocardiogram was performed which showed that the left
atrium was mildly dilated.  There was mild symmetrical left
ventricular hypertrophy.  The left ventricular cavity size
was normal.  Overall left ventricular systolic function was
normal with an ejection fraction of approximately 70%.  The
right ventricular cavity was moderately dilated.  There was
global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.  The aortic
root was mildly dilated.  The aortic valve leaflets were
mildly thickened but not stenotic.  Mild aortic regurgitation
was seen.  The mitral valve leaflets were mildly thickened.
There was no mitral valve prolapse.  Trivial mitral
regurgitation was seen.  The left ventricular pattern
suggests impaired relaxation.  There was no pericardial
effusion.  Multiple laboratory studies were drawn to
determine the patient's coagulation status.  Protein C was
slightly elevated with a value of 132.  Protein S was normal
with a value of 91.  Homocystine was slightly elevated with a
value of 14.6.  Anticardiolipin antibody studies were normal.
The prothrombin mutation analysis showed no mutations and the
factor [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 5244**] analysis showed no genetic mutations also.
The patient remained on a heparin drip and he was seen by the
pulmonary team for evaluation of whether thrombolysis therapy
should be initiated.  The pulmonary team recommended
conservative management with intravenous heparin.  They
recommended no thrombolytics unless the patient were to
become hemodynamically unstable.  The patient was monitored
in the coronary care unit on a telemetry bed.  His O2
saturations remained above 92% on two liters.  He showed no
symptoms of hemodynamic instability and after 48 hours he was
started on Coumadin.  He was then transferred to the floor
until his INR became therapeutic.  The patient was then set
up with the outpatient [**Hospital 197**] clinic at the VA who will
manage his Coumadin and INR with a goal INR between 2 and 3.
He should remain on Coumadin for a minimum of six months.

2. Bipolar disorder:  The patient was mildly depressed during
his stay in the hospital.  He remained on his home
psychiatric medication regimen.  The patient was released in
stable condition.

3. Lovastatin 20 mg q.d.
4. Tegretol 200 mg t.i.d.
5. Olanzapine 5-15 mg q.h.s. p.r.n.

weeks.  The patient know to return to the emergency room if
he develops any shortness of breath, chest pain, chest
tightness, dyspnea on exertio
