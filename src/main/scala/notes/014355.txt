History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 15023**] is an 84 yo woman with DM2, CKD III atrial
fibrillation, HTN, OA, GERD, depression and anxiety who
presented to the ED this afternoon after being found to have an
supratherapeutic INR (~13) on routine check as well as acute
renal failure (creat 1.5-->5.6).

Upon arrival to the ED the patient was hr 83, BP 73/28, rr 18,
02 97% RA.  Pt given 2L NS, found to be guaiac positive.  BP
improved to 80s-90s with IVF.  Additionally got [**1-25**] U FFP and 10
mg PO vitamin K.  Additionally in the setting of hypotension,
the patient was given ceftriaxone.
Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient felt well overall.  She
had no acute complaints including no nausea, vomiting, fever,
chills, dizziness, chest pain, abdominal pain or shortness of
breath.  The patient  reports that over the last 3 weeks she has
had an overall feeling of unwellness.   She has had decreased
energy, depression and lack of appetite.  She has had
significantly lower PO intake and also noted new black stools
and mild dizziness.   She has had no presyncopal episodes and no
loss of consciousness.

ECHO [**2117-5-25**]:
The atria are moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). The right
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global free
wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension (likely UNDERestimated given severity of
TR). There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Dilated right ventricle with mild global systoilc dysfunction.
Moderate mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe tricuspid
regurgitation.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2117-4-7**],
right ventricle has further dilated and its systolic function
has deteriorated. Tricuspid regurgitation severity has
increased. The other findings are probably similar.

CT ABD / PELVIS [**2117-5-25**]:
1. No evidence of retroperitoneal or groin hematoma.
2. Trace amount of ascites around the liver.
3. Choledocholithiasis and dilatation of the common bile duct.
4. Colonic wall thickening extending from the transverse colon
to the
rectosigmoid junction consistent with pancolitis.
Preliminary findings were initially discussed with by the
radiology residnet on call with housestaff upon completion of
the examination. The final report findings were discussed with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 1:45 p.m. on [**2117-5-25**].

Persantine MIBI([**2117-5-31**])
Normal myocardial perfusion and LV function (LVEF 65%).
No anginal symptoms or ischemic EKG changes. Atrial
fibrillation with poor Ventricular rate control.


Brief Hospital Course:
84 yo F with acute on chronic renal failure complicated by a
supratherapeutic INR and hct drop

Colitis ?????? GI consulted, feel that the colitis given location,
blood in stool and concurrent renal failure / hypotension is
likely related to ischemic colitis.  Colonoscopy done [**5-28**] showed
pseudomembranes c/w C. diff colitis. Biopsies are negative for
cancer.  Stool + C.diff. treated with flagyl, course to end
[**6-10**].  EGD([**5-28**]) showed gastritis, she is taking Pantoprazole.
Hct: 35 on [**5-29**].  Diarrhea continues about twice/shift, still
guaiac positive.  Urgency with stool.  Clinically improving on
flagyl with improved WBC, no abdominal pain.  Encouraged to
increase fluid intake and add fiber to bulk stool.  If the
diarrhea continues after the Flagyl is finished she should be
started on oral vancomycin.  She should remain off aspirin and
Coumadin until [**6-7**] and then it should be determined by her
PCP whether she should continue on either.  Please do not resume
Coumadin without discussing with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] and arranging for
weekly INRs.

RV dysfunction ?????? CE flat.  Worsening RV systolic function as
well as TR, MR may have stayed the same. ?Ischemic related to an
RV infarct.  No acute infarct.  Risk factor modification.
Persantine MIBI completed on [**5-31**].  Showed no ischemia, nl wall
motion, EF >55%.

Supratherapeutic INR:  Possibly related to the poor PO intake.
She stated that she was taking all medications as prescribed.
Pill bottles brought to hospital and she was able to read doses
and frequency correctly.  No new meds that could have led to
drug interaction increasing INR.  Perhaps in future should just
be on full dose
