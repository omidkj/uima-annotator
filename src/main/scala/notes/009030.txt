History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 36698**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old lady, with a history of paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation and GI bleed (not currently anticoagulated),
who was discharged from [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] on [**2152-7-14**] after admission for
afib w/ RVR, attributed to a urinary tract infection, which
converted in the ED after diltiazem, fluid resuscitation and
antibiotics for her UTI, now readmitted with afib with RVR, with
increasing oxygen requirement.
.
On her previous admission, the patient had presented with
malaise, fevers and occasional dysuria.  She had already started
taking PO Bactrim, as prescribed by her PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] presented to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED after failure to improve, and was found to be in afib
with RVR.  She was initially treated with fluid boluses (total
4L) to keep her SBP > 90, as well as diltiazem 10 mg IVP x2,
diltiazem 30 mg and ceftriaxone. She converted back into normal
sinus rhythm.  Over the course of the admission, she was
continued on her home dose of amiodarone and not started on
another rate control medications given HR in the 60s after she
converted.  She was continued on Bactrim through her admission
and discharge home to continue treatment.
.
Today, the patient presented again in afib with RVR.  Per her
daughter, she was doing well yesterday but did have a fever up
to 101.3 last night, which responded to Tylenol x2.  This
morning, however, woke up feeling lightheaded and dizzy.  Family
noted that her heart rate was up again and she was audibly
wheezing.  VNA assessment at 12:00 pm revealed 98.7F, BP 140/70,
HR 132-152, SaO2 83%.  Her family brought her back to the
hospital.
.
While in the ED, her initial vitals were 97.6F, HR 160, BP
94/61, RR 22, O2Sat 90% on 4L NC.  Per report, she received 15
mg of IV dilt by EMS.  Upon arrival to the ED, she received
another 15 mg of IV dilt.  CXR showed bilateral lower lobe
opacities R > L, mild interstital opacities and small bilateral
effusion, ?atelectasis vs. PNA.  Labs significant for a
leukocytosis to 12.4 with 86.3%. She also had elevated BNP up to
5944.  Of note, UA had cleared (negative nitrites, no bacteria).
 No lasix was given because of borderline SBP (upper 80s to
100s).  She was placed on a dilt gtt after ED resident spoke
with cardiology fellow.  Her HR has been consistently in the
120s-130s with occasional rate up to the 150s.  Patient was
subsequently transferred to [**Hospital1 1516**] on 50% venturi mask satting in
the low 90%/95% on NRB, BP 93/64, HR 121, RR 24.
.
Upon arriving the floor, vitals were BP 112/78, HR 130s-150s, RR
30s, 88% on 50% Venturi mask.  She was triggered immediately for
tachycardia and hypoxia.  Please see trigger note for more
details.  Due to volume overload and pulmonary edema apparent on
physical exam, she was given furosemide 40 mg IV x1.  She was
also placed on a NRB, after which she satted 94%.  She was
continued on her diltiazem drip, which was uptitrated to 15
mg/hr.  Additionally, given the question of pneumonia on her
chest x-ray, she was started on empiric coverage for HCAP with
cefepime/vancomycin/azithromycin.
.
Patient reports feeling okay.  Denies any particular discomfort
at this time but does appear very tachypneic.  Family at bedside
very anxious.
.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
ROS positive as described in HPI.
ROS negative for history of stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis,
pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery, myalgias,
joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black stools or red stools.  All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.
