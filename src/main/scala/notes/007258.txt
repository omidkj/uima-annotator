Micro/Imaging:
[**2183-9-13**] CT Head Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage (frontal and
temporal lobes), small acute SDH along the right parietal
convexity.

[**2183-9-13**] CT chest/abd/pelvis
1. T8 compression fracture with paraspinal hematoma. Minimally
displaced T8 spinous process fracture and left T10 transverse
process fracture.

2. Left posterior seventh rib fracture.


[**2183-9-14**] Repeat CT Head  1. Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage,
right greater than left, with slightly increased conspicuity on
the right. Increased sulcal effacement at the right vertex,
indicative of increased cerebral swelling.

2. The previously noted small right parietal extra-axial
hematoma is not well assessed on today's exam, as it was only
visualized on the coronal and sagittal reformatted images of the
previous exam.

[**2183-9-14**] MR [**Last Name (Titles) **]
1. Acute compression fractures of T7, T8, T10, and T12 vertebral
bodies.

2. T8 vertebral body demonstrates mild loss of height and mild
retropulsion, resulting in mild spinal canal stenosis, but no
mass effect on the spinal cord.

3. Known posterior element fractures are poorly assessed by MRI.


4. Anterior paravertebral hematoma from T5 through T10, with
slight extension inferiorly to T12. No evidence of anterior or
posterior longitudinal ligament injury. Mild edema in the T5- T6
interspinous ligament. Edema in the posterior paravertebral
muscles and posterior subcutaneous fat.



Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to the Trauma service. Neurosurgery was
consulted given the brain hemorrhage and spine fractures. He was
loaded and started on Dilantin. His injuries were managed non
operatively; serial neurologic exams and head CT scans were
followed closely. His repeat head CT scan did show a slight
increase in the right SAH with increase in cerebral swelling.
His neurologic exams did remain stable despite this slight
change. He was fitted for a TLSO brace for the spine fractures
which is to be worn at all times when out of bed.

His pain was controlled using oral narcotics and a bowel regimen
was initiated. His Dilantin will continue until follow up by
Neurosurgery.

He was evaluated by Physical therapy; teaching with patient and
family done regarding donning the TLSO brace properly. He was
cleared for discharge to home and given specific instructions
for his follow up appointments.
