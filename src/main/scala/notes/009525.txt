Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1838**]
Chief Complaint:
Fall - found to have ICH at outside hospital hence transferred
here for further evaluation and care.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The pt is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old right-handed woman with a PMH of DM and
HTN who was transferred from [**Location (un) 620**] with an ICH.

Ms. [**Known lastname **] states that she was in her USOH this morning but she
felt "weak" after breakfast but denied focal weakness. She got
and slipped back, falling without LOC. She thinks she may have
struck her head. She was unable to get up because her L arm was
weak. She also noticed that her speech was slurred.

EMS was called and she was noted to have L sided weakness and a
BS of 215. She was taken to the OSH where she was bradycardic
(40's) and HTN (SBP 220). Her exam was reportedly notable for L
sided weakness, L facial droop and dysarthria. A head CT was
done which was reported as a pontine bleed but on review of the
images, she has a R BG bleed. Screening labs showed an INR of
1.1, platelets of 243 and a troponin of >0.01. Her K was
elevated but hemolyzed. She was started on a nitro drip and
transferred here for further care.

ROS:
The pt denied headache, loss of vision, blurred vision,
diplopia, dysphagia, lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus or
hearing difficulty. Denied difficulties producing or
comprehending speech. Denied focal numbness, paraesthesia. No
bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. Denied difficulty
with gait. The pt
denied recent fever or chills. No night sweats or recent weight
loss or gain. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest
pain or tightness, palpitations. Denied nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in
bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied arthralgias or
myalgias. Denied rash.

Past Medical History:
- Iron deficiency anemia
- DM
- GIB (pt denies)
- Squamous cell of leg (pt states she had a second opinion and
was told it was not CA)
- afib
- HTN
- glaucoma
- cataracts

-EtOh: denies
-tobacco:  denies
-drugs:  denies


Family History:

Physical Exam:
Vitals: T: P: 44 R: 16 BP: 179/74-220/96 SaO2: 99% on RA
General: Awake, cooperative, NAD.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in
oropharynx; significant opacification of both corneas
Neck: Supple, no carotid bruits appreciated.
Pulmonary: decreased breath sounds at bases
Cardiac: nl. S1S2, no murmur
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds, no masses or
organomegaly noted.
Extremities: no edema.
Skin: multiple pigmented lesions (one on her R leg which is
slightly ulcerated)

Neurologic:
-Mental Status: Alert, oriented x 3 ([**Hospital 86**] hospital rather than
[**Hospital1 **]). Able to relate history without difficulty. Attentive, but
has difficulty with [**Doctor Last Name 1841**] backwards, continues to do them forwards
without difficulty and does not change task despite cues;
Language is fluent with intact repetition and comprehension.
Normal prosody. There were no paraphasic errors. Pt. was able to
name both high and low frequency objects but has difficulty
seeing objects on the card (calls the feather a leaf, calls the
cactus a plant and thinks the key looks like a hatchet). Unable
to read, says the letters are too small and needs a large
magnifying glass to read at baseline. Speech was mildly
dysarthric. Able to follow both midline and appendicular
commands
on the R but with repeated cues. There was no evidence of
apraxia
or neglect.

CN
I: not tested
II,III: VFF to confrontation, pupils 4mm->2mm bilaterally,
unable
to visualize fundi through the lense opacification
III,IV,V: EOMI, no ptosis. No nystagmus
V: sensation intact V1-V3 to LT
VII: L facial droop
VIII: hears finger rub bilaterally
IX,X: palate elevates symmetrically, uvula midline
[**Doctor First Name 81**]: SCM/trapezeii [**5-23**] bilaterally
XII: tongue protrudes midline, no dysarthria

Motor: + R resting and postural tremor. Slightly decreased bulk
throughout. No asterixis. Motor impersistence, requires repeated
cues to follow strength testing.  No pronator drift on the R.
The
R arm, R leg and L leg are all briskly antigravity and she is at
least a 4 in all groups but has motor impersistence so it is
difficult to access if there is subtle weakness. The L arm does
not move to voluntarily or to nox stim but raising the hand in
front of her she is able to move her fingers slightly. She knows
it is her hand.

Reflex: No clonus

-Sensory: No deficits to light touch.  No extinction to DSS.
Unreliable vibratory & proprioception response throughout.

-Coordination: No dysmetria on FNF on the R. Unable on the L.

-Gait: deferred given HTN

CT HEAD: Acute right basal ganglia hemorrhage with small amount
of
surrounding edema. Unchanged in size and configuration since
prior study done earlier in the morning. No midline shift. No
new hemorrhage identified.

MRI HEAD:
1. Signal abnormality in the right basal ganglia consistent with
recent
hemorrhage and findings on prior CT.

2. No evidence of new hemorrhage or other acute intracranial
abnormality.

3. Narrowing of distal M2 segment of the right MCA; however,
this may be at
the limit of resolution of MRA.

4. Stable remote left MCA infarct.

5. Probable small remote hemorrhage in the pons.

Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%). Transmitral Doppler and
tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV
(severe) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular
septal defect. The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation
is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests a restrictive filling abnormality, with elevated left
atrial pressure. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
The main pulmonary artery is dilated. The branch pulmonary
arteries are dilated. There is no pericardial effusion.

L shoulder x-ray: There is a comminuted fracture of the left
humeral head and neck with lateral displacement of the proximal
fracture
fragment. Mild osteoarthrosis of the acromioclavicular joint is
noted. The
visualized portion of the left lung is clear.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman hx of atrial fibrillation, not on
coumadin, who had a fall on the morning of admission and found
that she was dysarthric with left arm and
leg weakness. She was initially taken to [**Hospital3 628**] where
CT brain showed a
right basal ganglia hemorrhage. There is also an old lef
