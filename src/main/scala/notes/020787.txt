LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  Sodium 132, potassium 4.4, BUN

polys, 0 bands, hematocrit 28.4, platelets 220, lactate 5.9.
UA negative for infection.  Chest x-ray showed no evidence of
infiltrate.

HOSPITAL COURSE - 1) SEPSIS:  The patient was initially
admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for sepsis as the
suspected source of the right antecubital fossa
thrombophlebitis versus cellulitis.  He was treated with IV
vancomycin and had a central line placed.  His quickly
defervesced.  He was seen by vascular surgery who felt that
there was no indication for urgent operation at this time,
and he improved within 48 hours, and was transferred to the
medical floor.

2) STERNAL WOUND DEHISCENCE:  The patient was seen by
cardiothoracic surgery and plastic surgery for a sternotomy
dehiscence after his coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
He was taken to the operating room on [**2148-4-5**] where
his sternum was repaired with a pectoralis muscle flap.
Please see the operative notes from Doctors [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and
[**Name5 (PTitle) 70**].  The patient did well postoperatively without any
significant complication.  However, he developed CHF and was
transferred to the cardiology service.

3) CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  The patient has baseline of
systolic congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction
of 30-35%.  After his sternal wound repair, he was developing
worsening congestive heart failure secondary to
intraoperative and perioperative IV hydration.  The patient
also developed a hyponatremia and was transferred to the
cardiology service for diuresis.  He was started on
nesiritide drip and made excellent progress with a negative
fluid balance daily, and an improvement in his creatinine.
He was quickly changed over to oral lasix and was continued
on his qd ACE inhibitor and Toprol XL.  On the day of
discharge, the patient's CHF regimen was Toprol XL 200 mg qd,
lisinopril 40 mg qd, and lasix 20 mg qd.  The patient will
follow-up with his cardiologist and will follow-up with his
primary care physician [**Name Initial (PRE) 176**] 2 days of discharge to reassess
his volume status.

4) CHEST PAIN:  The patient had postsurgical chest pain and
was initially treated with a PCA without any basal rate.
After several days, the patient was changed over to oral
narcotics and was slowly weaned.  However, throughout the
admission the patient continued to complain of chest pain,
while at the same time getting up, walking around the floor,
and asking for additional narcotics and benzodiazepines.  The
patient had multiple EKGs checked during his episodes of
chest pain.  He never had any EKG changes consistent with
ischemia.  His vital signs remained stable during his
episodes of chest pain, and his episodes of chest pain were
felt to be solely due to musculoskeletal pain.

The patient was seen in consultation by the psychiatry
service and was instructed to follow-up with psychiatry.
However, the patient has refused to follow-up with psychiatry
in the past.  Even on the day of discharge, the patient
complained of chest pain as he was being told that he was
being discharged.  An EKG was checked at that time, and there
were no changes on his EKG compared to his baseline EKG from
[**2148-3-22**].  His EKG only showed evidence of prior
inferior ischemia and nonspecific, stable ST-T segment
changes.  The patient reports having had multiple admissions
to multiple hospitals in the [**Location (un) 86**] area over the past
several months, and has stated that he has spent very few
days not in a hospital.  By report, he has had these multiple
admissions for noncardiac chest pain.

5) CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient does, however, have
a long history of coronary artery disease and has had
coronary artery bypass graft surgery with a LIMA to LAD, and
an SVG to PDA.  The patient did not have any active ischemia
during this admission, and was continued on his cardiac
regimen consisting of aspirin, Plavix, Lipitor, Toprol XL,
and lisinopril.

6) DRUG SEEKING BEHAVIOR:  During his admission, the patient
continuous showed drug seeking behavior.  He would complain
of chest pain that was so severe that he could not move.
However, he did not receive any narcotics for his chest pain.
He would then get up out of bed and walk around the floor
requesting additional pain medication from nursing staff and
house staff.  At this time, he would be walking around the
floor in no apparent distress, other than appearing angry
because he could not receive any narcotics.  In addition,
when discussing his discharge, the patient initially refused
discharge even when he was deemed medically stable for
discharge.  He felt that his pain would not be controlled as
an outpatient and was demanding prescriptions for percocet,
ativan, Ambien, and morphine.  The pat
