History of Present Illness:
57 yo M with a past history of DMI, ESRD on HD, CHF, PVD who
presents to the ED with hyperglycemia noted at dialysis. Patient
arrived for scheduled HD today feeling in his USOH and was found
to have a "critically high" finger stick glucose, so patient was
transferred to the ED. Patient denies frank symptoms including
fever, chills, abdominal pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting and
cough. Patient does report medicine noncompliance, and tells me
that he did not take his insulin today or yesterday because he
"did not feel like it", and "because I know when I'm in DKA".
Patient has a history of noncompliance, and takes several of his
other medications on a periodic basis, including his statin and
steroid. Other than not taking his 2 dogs for a walk yesterday,
but he states this was not because he was lethargic or confused.

.
In the ED, patient was noted to have a serum glucose of 639 with
an AG of 20, and a VBG with a pH of 7.36. He received an IV
bolus of Regular 8U, and was started on an insulin drip  of 8
U/hr. No imaging was performed and a UA was not obtained. He
received 1L of saline. [**Name (NI) **] father, who is legal guardian,

sticks during admission were in 200s-300s. He was discharged

Brief Hospital Course:
57 yo man with type 1 DM, ESRD on HD, CHF, PVD, who presents
with DKA in the setting of insulin noncompliance.
.
# Hyperglycemia with anion gap: Most likely etiology is dietary
noncompliance. No evidence of infection given lack of fevers,
and normal WBC. EKG at baseline without evidence of ischemia. No
history of intoxication. Patient did have elevated AG, but VBG
was without evidence of acidosis. He was continued on an insulin
drip until the gap closed at which point we restarted glargine 2
units daily (patient on levemir at home) with humalog SS.
Continued prednisone 5mg [**Hospital1 **] which patient takes at home for
autoimmune induced diabetes.
.
# ESRD secondary to DM: Patient received HD on HD#2 prior to
discharge, and was set up for an extra session at his outpatient
facility on the day after discharge.  Continued sevelamer and
nephrocaps.
.
# Hypertension: Continued CCB, Minoxidil, and beta blocker.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Continued statin
