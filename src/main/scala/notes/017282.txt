ADDENDUM:  This is an interval Discharge Summary from [**4-6**]
to [**2122-4-16**].  Please refer to the Discharge Summary
dated [**2122-4-5**] for summary of the patient's initial
admission and initial hospital course from this admission.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE (From [**4-6**] to [**2122-4-16**]):  The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a history of
non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (status post
catheterization), diastolic congestive heart failure (with an
ejection fraction of 75%), diabetes mellitus, chronic renal
insufficiency, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, with
questionable compliance with medications who was recently
discharged from the hospital after a direct current
cardioversion, amiodarone loading, and aggressive diuresis
who was sent home with a peripherally inserted central
catheter line for home Lasix.

The patient presented on [**3-24**] with atrial fibrillation
and atrial flutter, hypotension (with a systolic blood
pressure in the 70s), and acute renal failure.

 1.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  The patient's
diuretics were initially held for acute-on-chronic renal
failure.  As her renal function improved, a Lasix drip was
started and continued until [**4-15**] when she was
transitioned to Bumex 2 mg by mouth twice per day with
continued good diuresis.

A magnetic resonance angiography of the renal arteries on
[**4-9**] showed no evidence of renal artery stenosis.  The
patient was started on a dopamine drip at 5 mcg/kg per hour
on [**4-7**] to increase renal perfusion and not for blood
pressure.  The patient tolerated this dopamine drip well
without increased rhythm ectopy, and she diuresed well on
this.  The patient was transitioned from a dopamine drip
(which was eventually turned off on [**4-12**]) to by mouth
medications including Sinemet, pyridoxine, and [**Last Name (un) **]-Dur
(that, in some studies, has been shown to increase renal
perfusion).  The Sinemet dose was eventually increased, and
the highest ratio combination of levodopa to carbidopa was
used.  Pyridoxine is thought to increase peripheral levodopa
conversion, and [**Last Name (un) **]-Dur is thought to decrease dopamine
breakdown.

The patient continued to diurese well with this by mouth
regimen without any side effects notes.  A theophylline level
scheduled was to be sent on the day of discharge to monitor
for toxic levels, and this was to be followed up by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2031**].  The patient's Aldactone was initially held due to
her renal function but was restarted on [**4-14**] at 25 mg once
per day.  The patient was intermittently on Biomox 250 mg
once per day from [**4-6**] to [**4-7**] as well as [**4-14**] to
[**4-16**] for her low chloride and high bicarbonate on
laboratory tests.

On discharge, the patient was hemodynamically stable and
diuresing well to the aforementioned regimen.  The patient
was to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2031**] early next week.

 2.  RHYTHM ISSUES:  Atrial fibrillation, which had been
successfully cardioverted during her last hospitalization
stay, as well as on [**2122-4-3**].  However, following
this cardioversion, the patient returned to be in and out of
atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.  The decision was
made not to pursue another direct current cardioversion at
this time, as the patient's diuresis was not significantly
affected by her rhythm/atrial tick.  She was continued on
amiodarone, and cardioversion will be considered in the
future once her congestive heart failure has been stabilized.
The patient was maintained on Coumadin for her atrial
fibrillation with a goal INR of 2 to 3.  Continue to check
her Coumadin dose which is currently at 2 mg at hour of sleep
as needed; especially when the patient's antibiotics are
discontinued.

 3.  HEMODYNAMIC ISSUES:  The patient vital signs were stable
throughout her hospital stay.  Her baseline systolic blood
pressure was in the 90s to 100s on medications; as mentioned.

 4.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  Coronary artery disease
was stable without symptoms or evidence of ischemia.  The
patient was continued on aspirin, metoprolol, and a statin.

 5.  URINARY TRACT INFECTION ISSUES:  The patient with a
history of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus in her urine.
She was originally started on levofloxacin for a positive
urinalysis but changed to Macrobid once Macrobid-sensitive
Escherichia coli grew out. However, a repeat urine culture on
[**4-5**] still showed greater than 100,000 Escherichia
coli.  Therefore, Macrobid was initially changed to
levofloxacin.  However, the sensitivities of this new
culture levofloxacin-resistant bugs.  The patient had an
unclear history of a childhood allergy to penicillin;
however, the decision was made to start her on ceftriaxone
nonetheless - which was started on [**4-8**] - and the patient
tolerated this well.  A planned 14-day course for her urinary
tract infection.

 6.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient's NPH insulin
dose was adjusted based on her fingerstick blood glucose
levels.  The patient was also covered with a Humalog insulin
sliding-scale.  As the patient's eating habits and intake
changes, her NPH continued to be titrated.

 7.  ANEMIA ISSUES:  The patient received one unit of packed
red blood cells in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, and her
Epogen dose was increased from one time per week to two times
per week.  The patient's hematocrit remained stable in the
high 20s and low 30s throughout the remainder of her hospital
stay.

 8.  PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES:  The Psychiatry Service followed the
patient throughout her stay and titrated her medications.  At
discharge, the patient was stable on citalopram, olanzapine,
and Remeron.

 9.  NEUROPATHIC PAIN ISSUES:  Neuropathic pain was likely
related to her diabetes.  The patient was continued on
Neurontin and a low-dose Fentanyl patch with good effect.
The patient also with right leg lower extremity ulcerations
as well as right buttock ulcerations which were dressed twice
per day including Xeroform dressings.

10.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  Clinically euthyroid.  The
patient was continued on her Synthroid dose.

11.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient was
maintained on a diabetic/cardiac diet with a fluid
restriction of 1.5 liters per day, also a low-sodium diet.

12.  PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  The patient was on Coumadin, as
well as Fosamax, calcium carbonate, and vitamin D.

13.  CODE STATUS ISSUES:  The patient is a full code.
