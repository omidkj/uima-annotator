problems with her sternal wound, and was most recently
admitted in [**2187-4-16**].  She now returns from an outside
hospital after a positive culture for methicillin resistant
staphylococcus aureus from the wound.  She reports being
otherwise stable, and is getting ready for discharge home

a small hole at the inferior aspect of her sternum that oozes
copious amounts of pus.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   She is a well-appearing, pleasant
female, in no acute distress.  Her temperature is 97.5, pulse
87, blood pressure 120/60, respiratory rate 16, oxygen
saturation 97% on room air.  Neurologically, she is grossly
intact.  Cardiovascular:  She has a regular rate and rhythm
without murmur.  Breath sounds are coarse, with scattered
rhonchi but no wheezes.  Her abdomen is obese, soft,
nontender, nondistended, with bowel sounds present.  Her
sternal incision has skin that is well healed with the
exception of a .5 cm open area along the inferior portion,
draining large amounts of yellow pus.  There is no erythema,
and the sternum is stable to palpation.  Her left lower
extremity vein harvest site distal to the knee also has a
small open area with minimal drainage and a small amount of
erythema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 13.5, hematocrit
34.8, platelets 424.  Sodium 142, potassium 4.1, chloride
106, bicarbonate 26, BUN 11, creatinine 0.8, glucose 101.
Her coagulation studies are normal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient was admitted to the Cardiac
Surgery service with a diagnosis of sternal wound infection.
A culture was immediately taken of the wound.  A PICC line
was placed, and she was started on intravenous vancomycin
and, in addition, she was started on oral Levaquin.  A
urinalysis was sent that revealed that she had a urinary
tract infection. In addition, the wound culture was positive
for 4+ PMNs in addition rule out 4+ gram-positive cocci and
4+ gram-negative rods.  This culture ultimately grew
methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, group B strep,
another unidentified gram-positive rod that we are presuming
was diphtheroids or Carinii bacterium.  In addition, from her
anaerobic culture, she grew Prevotella that was beta
lactamase positive and Peptostreptococcus.

A CT scan was obtained that demonstrated inflammatory changes
within the anterior mediastinum and a 7 x 13 mm fluid
collection.  In addition, there were some small lymph nodes
within the mediastinum.  In addition, they found a tiny
calcified nodule in the right middle lobe that was felt to
likely represent a granuloma, and another tiny noncalcified
nodule in the lingula that was also likely benign in origin.
Finally, her adrenal mass was imaged and demonstrated no
change in size.  The Radiology staff believes that this is
likely an adenoma.

A Plastic Surgery consult was obtained regarding this
patient's sternal wound infection.  They ultimately
recommended a two-stage operation in which the patient was
debrided and later received a closure flap.  Therefore, on
[**2187-7-2**], the patient was taken to the operating room,
where she had a sternal debridement.  The procedure itself
was unremarkable.  Postoperatively, she was taken to the
Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit.  During this time, her
white blood cell count climbed to as high as 19.9.  She did
have wet-to-dry dressings to her sternum and, within about
two days, it was felt that her wound looked improved enough
for the second stage of her operation.  On [**2187-7-4**], she
was taken to the operating room by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 13797**] and his team.
There she received bilateral pectoralis major muscle
advancement flap closure of her wound.  The patient's
procedure itself was unremarkable.  Postoperatively, she was
kept in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit for some time for
observation, but ultimately arrived on the floor.

She did have some postoperative issues with pain management,
and it was difficult to find an appropriate regimen for her.
Initially she was kept on Vicodin with morphine for
breakthrough pain.  This did not adequately control her.  We
tried her on a patient-controlled analgesia, which she was
not able to use effectively.  Finally, she was started on
oral percocet, and that appeared to manage her pain
adequately well.

The patient's hematocrit did drop as low as 20,000.  She
received a total of four units of packed red blood cells.
Throughout the ensuing days of her hospitalization, she
demonstrated continued improvement.  Her wound remained
clean, dry and intact, without erythema.  On the day prior to
her transfer back to rehabilitation, the Plastic Surgery team
asked us to start applying bacitracin to the wound twice a
day.  She did have two [**Doctor Last Name 406**] drains that were left in place
with bulb suction.  In addition, she has wound anchors going
through some of her breast tissue that need to remain in
place until her postoperative visit.  Finally, she is to wear
a surgical bra at all times, and is to only have it open and
removed for wound inspection and dressing changes.

While the patient was here, we had a consult from the [**Last Name (un) **]
diabetes team.  They recommended changing her insulin from
75/25 once daily to a twice a day regimen.  She appeared to
be stable on 9 units of NPH in the morning and 5 units of NPH
in the evening with a sliding scale to cover.

A Medicine consult was obtained to help manage the patient's
multiple medical problems.  They ultimately recommended that
she be continued on her antibiotics and that her Aldactone be
restarted, which was held postoperatively.  In addition, they
recommended that a Dilantin level be checked.  It was found
to be therapeutic at 12.3.  All of her other medical problems
during this hospitalization appeared to be stable.

As the patient progressed to postoperative day number three
and four from her advancement flap, her white blood cell
count improved.  On the day prior to discharge, her white
count was down to 14,000.

On [**2187-7-9**], the patient was transferred back to
rehabilitation for further care and management.  She needs to
return in eight days to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 13797**]
in his [**Hospital 3816**] clinic.

The patient is transferred on the following medications:
1.  Vancomycin 1 gr
