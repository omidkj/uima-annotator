History of Present Illness:
This is an 81 yo gentleman with PMH significan for CHF, MI s/p
CABG and valve replacement who on Friday [**5-29**] was going to his
cardiologist's office by means of ambulance from a rehab
facility. On arrival the ambulance personel found him to be
hypotensive with SBP's in the 70s. He was taken to [**Hospital3 12748**] where he was give a 1L bolus of IVF and his SBP
pressures rose to the 90s. On admission his hematocrit was found
to be 28 and it was uncertain as to why at that time. He was
then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and admitted to the medical ICU. Mr.
[**Known lastname 68713**] does occasionally have bouts of hypotension as he describes
occuring about twice a week. They are associated with some light
headedness but denies chest pain, shortness of breath, arm/jaw
pain, changes in vision or increased perspirations with any of
these events. He did mention one prior episode of syncope
occuring 3-4 months prior assoicated with only light headedness
and no other symptoms. He woke up according to him seconds after
the event occurred. He also mentioned a decrease in his
nutritional intake for approximately two weeks since his last
admission to this hospital. He has not been eating or drinking
as much as he usually does. He denies missing doses of
antibiotics. He does endorse anorexia and poor PO intake but
says these have both been present for a while.
.
While in the medical ICU his initial SBP's were in the low 100s
and had a few bouts of light-headedness but unclear if these
were at the times of hypotension. Patient received volume
repletion of 3L in the ED, no additional volume in the MICU. His
ACEi, BB, Spironolactone and Torsemide were held. His pressures
increased somewhat overnight without further volume
adminisitration. His antibiotics were continued.
.
At the time of transfer he said he was feeling well back to his
normal baseline functioning. He did report a continuing cough
that began approximately 2 weeks ago and is productive of white
sputum. It has not been getting better or worse and denies any
recent history of a URI.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is an 81 year old man with a past medical history of severe
CHF, CAD, and s/p MVR presenting after recent hospitalization
for GI bleed and endovascular infection with hypotension.

1) Hypotension: Differential is, of course, concerning including
sepsis vs cardiogenic shock.  That being said pt had no fevers,
is on broad spectrum antibiotics, and does not suggest any signs
or have ECG suggestive of myocardial ischemia.  He also was
minimally symptomatic and improved dramatically with fluid
boluses suggesting perhaps simply dehydration. His blood
pressures have remained mostly stable with systolic blood
pressures ranging between 90s-110s following the 1L NS given at
[**Hospital3 **] and another 3L NS given in ED at [**Hospital1 18**]. On the
hospital floor we have slowly started him back on his home
cardiac meds: metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] instead of 25mg [**Hospital1 **] which is
his home regimin and lisinopril 2.5mg QHS and his blood
pressures have remained stable. We have decided to stop
torsemide and spironolactone. During this admission. We tried to
begin torsemide during this admission but Mr. [**Known lastname 68713**] experienced
an episode of hypotension. We then reduced his home torsemide to
half what he was taking as an out patient and he had another
episode of hypotension. It seems as though Mr. [**Known lastname 68713**] might be
having difficulty keeping his daily oral intake up with his
current diuretic doses. He might need to have his cardiac
medication doses adjusted to this lower level of fluid intake.
We are holding his diuretics at the time of discharge and we
would like him to follow up with his cardiologist for further
changes to his cardiac meds.

2)Hx of GI Bleed/ UE DVT: Pt developed DVT in left arm around
his PICC line. We the pulled the PICC line and started him on a
Heparin Drip.
