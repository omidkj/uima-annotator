History of Present Illness:
58 yo M with ESRD on HD, DM, PVD s/p BKA on [**First Name3 (LF) **] and [**First Name3 (LF) 4532**], dCHF
admitted today from the ED with BRBPR and ongoing diarrhea. He
was recently here at [**Hospital1 18**] for N/V/D and CT A/P that showed
cecal inflammation. In [**Month (only) 116**], he had been admitted with a L foot
infection and was on broad spectrum abx at that time. During his
most recent admission in [**Month (only) **] was treated for colitis initially
with cipro/flagyl and po vancomycin and was ultimately
discharged on po vancomycin, last does was yesterday. C. diff
was negative x3 but he was treated given his leukocytosis of 27
and left shift. Patient was discharged to rehab on [**7-21**].
This morning, patient reports he had an episode of BRBPR without
any pain and he came to the ED. He states his diarrhea has not
resolved - [**4-19**] stools/day. No N/V, and he is taking PO without
difficulty.  He has no fever, chills, or associated abdominal
pain. Per NH documentation, has not had blood stools previously.
.
In the ED, Initial vitals: 98.8 90 115/55 18 91%RA. CT A/P again
ischemia vs infectious. A RIJ was placed. Hct was 29 down from
32 on last d/c. No blood was given. He received a dose of cipro
and flagyl. He was seen by GI who felt that he was stable for
the medical floor given his stable bp/hr. VS prior to transfer
to floor: 99.1 79 126/47 96% on RA.
.
Upon arrival to the floor, patient had 2 large bloody bowel
movements and the ICU was consulted for transfer per GI request.
Upon evaluation on the floor bp was 130/65 hr 89. Patient
reports he is very fatigued and sleepy. He denies abdominal
pain, fever/chills, chest pain, or SOB.

CT ABDOMEN:
1. Stable appearance of the ascending colon with mild bowel wall
thickening and pericolonic fat stranding with apparent
hypoenhancement of the mucosa along the cecum. No definite signs
for pneumatosis or free air. Please note, given the appearance
of the colon, the possibility of ischemic colitis is a also a
consideration, though the possibility of infectious or
inflammatory colitis cannot be excluded.
2. Cholelithiasis without CT evidence for cholecystitis.
3. Atrophic and cystic kidneys compatible with diagnosis of
end-stage renal disease in this patient on hemodialysis.

Colonoscopy:
Colonic mucosa appeared grossly normal upon insertion through
the anal canal. At the hepatic flexure there was abrupt severe
changes consistent with colitis characterized by exudate,
ulcerations, and areas that appeared to be denuded mucosa. At
the hepatic flexure there was a circumferential area of mucosa
that had an adenomatous appearance that was biopsied separately.
In the cecum was 1.5 cm well circumscribed punched out
ulceration with exudate. This was adjacent to what was clearly
identified as the appendiceal orifice. In the jar labeled cecum,
biopsies of the edge of the ulcer and the surrounding mucosa
were obtained. (biopsy, biopsy)
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum and distal 6 cm of ileum

Recommendations: Differential diagnosis includes ischemic
colitis, less likely CMV or C-diff colitis and even lower on the
differential inflammatory bowel disease. Of note, the distal 6
cm of the ileum appeared normal.

Brief Hospital Course:
# ACUTE BLOOD LOSS ANEMIA:  He had bright red blood per rectum,
and his hematocrit drop to mid twenties, but he remained
hemodynamically stable. He was taken to colonoscopy where he was
found to have ulcerations in the colon most prominent along the
hepatic flexure.  There was a high suspicion that this was due
to ischemic disease due a watershed infarct.  Other etiologies
considered were infectious (CMV biopsy) and inflammatory bowel
disease.  The final path report suggested his bleeding was
secondary to ischemia.  He was transfused two units of blood in
the MICU, and he continued to have intermittent episodes of
bloody bowel movements. His hematocrit remained stable.  He was
transferred to the floor where he had brown stool that was quiac
positive.  Since his transfer, he has not any bloody bowel
movements.
.
# COLITIS: He was found to have evidence of colitis on imaging
and was started on ciprofloxacin and Flagyl for 10 days.  He
will be discharged to an extended care facility where he will
take an additional 5 day course of antibiotics (Finishes
[**2118-8-9**]).
.
# Peripheral [**Year (4 digits) **] Disease: Due to his bloody bowel movment,
we held his aspirin and [**Year (4 digits) **] until he could discuss restarting
his medications at follow up appointments with GI and [**Year (4 digits) **]
surgery.
.
# Passive Suicide Ideation: The patient made passive comments
about not wanting to live while in the hospital.  He was seen by
psychiatry and cleared to return to the nursing home.  They
recommended Seroquel at bed time to help improve his sleep.
.
# ESRD: Dialysis while in the hospital (Tu/[**Last Name (un) **]/Sat).
.
# Diastolic CHF: He was started on a low dose ace inhibitor.  He
will need electrolytes checked in one week.
