CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Melena and lethargy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with
type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, who was at [**Hospital3 11911**] Center in [**Location (un) **] after suffering a fall.
The rehabilitation facility staff found the patient to be in
nausea with lethargy and having dark tarry stools.  EMS was
contact[**Name (NI) **] and they found the patient to be responsive only to
painful stimuli.  Vital signs at the time were blood pressure
85/palpable, heart rate 84, fingerstick glucose 344
mg/deciliter.  Field electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus
rhythm at 80 beats per minute, ST depressions in leads II,
III and aVF.  Oxygen saturation at the time was 88% in room
air and increased to 96% on four liters per minute nasal
cannula.

The patient arrived in the Emergency Department on the
morning of [**2143-7-24**], incontinent of stool, the stool
described as black or maroon appearance.  Temperature at the
time was 99.4, blood pressure 112/43, pulse 86, respiratory
rate 18, and the oxygen saturation was 99% in room air.
Electrocardiogram in the Emergency Department was notable for
ST depression.  Nasogastric lavage was notable for no blood.
The blood pressure at the time systolic was approximately 80
mmHg.  Hematocrit was found to be 16.8.   The patient later
was intubated for airway respiratory protection as well as
decline in her mental status and was sent to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  The patient was started on Levophed and
this was later discontinued secondary to the patient
developing hypertension.  The patient received four units of
packed red blood cells as well as fresh frozen plasma.  In
the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was successfully
extubated.  In the meantime, the patient had ruled in for
myocardial infarction by cardiac enzymes.  In particular,
serial troponin levels were as follows:  first value was less
than 0.3, the second was positive at 2.0, the third was
positive at 3.5 and the fourth was positive at 1.1.  CK MB
initially positive at 11.0 and subsequent levels were 9.0,
6.0 and 5.0.  The patient was then deemed stable enough for
transfer to the floor which occurred on [**2143-7-26**].  Of note,
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was not done by gastroenterology
because of the patient's recent myocardial infarction.
Gastroenterology felt it was better to defer to a later date
possibly as an outpatient.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On arrival to the floor, the patient's
vital signs were as follows:  weight 52.4 kilograms,
temperature 97.1, blood pressure 160/palpable, heart rate 76,
respiratory rate 20 and oxygen saturation 95% on two liters.
The patient was an oriented, agitated elderly female who
looked younger than her stated age.  Her lungs upon
examination were notable for faint bilateral crackles.  The
heart was irregularly irregular and the abdomen was soft,
nontender, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities notable for 1+
pulses all around but no pedal edema.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Aspirin 325 mg once daily.
2.  Lopressor 25 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Metformin 850 mg p.o. twice a day.
4.  Glucotrol 5 mg q.d.
5.  Colace 100 mg twice a day.
7.  Tylenol.

the patient was on the following medications:
1.  Insulin sliding scale.
2.  Lorazepam 0.5 mg to 2.0 mg intravenously q4-6hours p.r.n.
3.  Morphine 2 to 4 mg intravenously q4-6hours p.r.n.

5.  Metoprolol 25 mg twice a day.
6.  Protonix 40 mg intravenously once daily.

LABORATORY DATA:  On arrival to the floor, the patient's
hematocrit was 32.5%  Prothrombin time was 13.1 and partial
thromboplastin time was 26.7 seconds and INR was 1.2.  Blood
cultures were notable for one out of four bottles positive
for gram positive cocci, identification is still pending.
Urine culture is negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient's hematocrit remained stable
overnight.  Therefore, decision was made to discharge the
patient back to rehabilitation facility as soon as
transportation can be arranged.  The patient's condition at
discharge is stable.
