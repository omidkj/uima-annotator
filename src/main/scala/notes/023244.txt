HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84-year-old
male with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
remote tobacco history, coronary artery disease (status post
myocardial infarction times two), recent unstable angina with
catheterization showing 3-vessel disease who was transferred
from an outside hospital following and episode of congestive
heart failure.

The patient was reported to be an active volunteer at the
outside hospital until one and a half years ago when he
reportedly had a decline in his exercise tolerance secondary
to a myocardial infarction and arthritis.  The patient
complained of chest pain which was nonradiating upon waking
up in the morning, relieved by nitroglycerin recently.  These
complaints were worked up by cardiac catheterization on
[**2189-10-1**] which showed 3-vessel disease.

The patient was advised to have a coronary artery bypass
graft.  The patient was in the middle of undergoing a workup
for the coronary artery bypass graft (which included
evaluation of his renal insufficiency); when, over the period
from [**2189-10-16**] through [**2189-10-18**], the patient
woke up on three successive nights with shortness of breath
without any chest pain, diaphoresis, or other symptoms.  The
first two episodes lasted a few minutes but resolved
spontaneously.  The third episode apparently did not resolve
for greater than 30 minutes; at which point the patient
called an ambulance was taken to the outside hospital where
he was found to be in congestive heart failure.

He was admitted there and diuresed over a period of days.
The patient was noted to hypertensive on admission at the
outside hospital with a troponin leak (peak 1.6).  On
evaluation, the patient was found to have left renal artery
stenosis.  Following resolution of the patient's congestive
heart failure, he was transferred to the [**Hospital1 346**] for further management.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2189-10-26**].  He was to
undergo evaluation by the Cardiothoracic Surgery team for
coronary artery bypass graft.

Following an evaluation of the patient's status and
discussion of the treatment option, the patient decided to
proceed with coronary artery bypass graft.  There was some
concern about his possible need for dialysis following the
procedure.

The patient was taken to surgery on [**2189-10-29**] where
he under a 4-vessel coronary artery bypass graft with the
internal mammary being grafted to the left anterior
descending artery, and the saphenous vein graft to the
diagonal, the ramus and obtuse marginal.  Thereafter, the
patient was transferred to the Cardiothoracic Surgery
Recovery Unit for continued monitoring.

The multiple events during the patient's stay in the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit included episodes of
bradycardia (down to the 20s to 40s).  The patient also went
into atrial fibrillation on postoperative day two.  Following
the persistence of these symptoms, the patient was ultimately
scheduled for a pacemaker placement.

The patient's atrial fibrillation remained refractory to
amiodarone, but rate control was achieved with Lopressor.
Amiodarone dosing was limited by the patient's episodes of
bradycardia.

The patient ultimately had a pacemaker placed on
postoperative day six and was thereafter transferred to the
regular Cardiothoracic Surgery floor.

Immediately following the placement of the pacemaker, an
attempt was made to cardiovert the patient to sinus rhythm,
but he reverted back to atrial fibrillation.  He was
therefore transferred to the floor and started on Lopressor
at 25 mg b.i.d. as well as amiodarone 400 mg t.i.d. (with a
plan to taper the amiodarone).

By postoperative day six, the patient was doing well on the
floor with his pain well controlled.  He continued to switch
back and forth from a normal sinus rhythm to atrial
fibrillation.  The patient was started on Coumadin therapy on
the day following the placement of his pacemaker.  He was
maintained on a heparin drip with a plan to discontinue the
drip when the patient was therapeutic on his Coumadin.

By postoperative day seven, the patient's pacemaker had been
confirmed to be working well.  Arrangements were made for his
discharge to a rehabilitation facility following discharge.

The patient had an episode of urinary retention while in the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit requiring a Urology
consultation.  Although the initial recommendation was for
the patient to be discharged with a Foley catheter and a leg
bag, the patient was subsequently able to void on his own
without a catheter.  The patient will need to follow up with
his urologist following discharge.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Coumadin (dosed daily).

Service at 10 a.m. on [**2189-11-10**].  He was to call
[**Telephone/Fax (1) 21817**] for an appointment.
3.  The patient was to follow up with his primary care
physician one to two weeks following discharge.
4.  The patient's Coumadin dosing will need to be monitored
at the rehabilitation facility until his subsequent discharge
to home where his Coumadin dosing will need to be monitored
by either his primary care physician or his cardiologist.

coronary artery bypass graft.
