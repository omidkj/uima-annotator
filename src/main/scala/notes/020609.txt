Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2130-7-3**] Thoracentesis

History of Present Illness:
53 year old man with a history of recurrent/metastatic rectal
adenocarcinoma (originally clinical stage IIIB uT3 uN1 cM0) s/p
proctosigmoidectomy with end
colostomy and chemotherapy and radiation who presents with one
week of worsening shortness of breath. He has had dyspnea for
the past week, but noticed it become more severe over the last 2
days. He called the heme/onc on-call fellow this AM reporting he
had difficulty catching his breath last night and his SpO2 was
high 80s until they increased the O2 to 3L. It was discussed
that his last CT chest shows an increased right pleural effusion
and that this could be the likely etiology of the increased work
of breathing and oxygen requirement. It was thought taht they
could keep the O2 at 3L and see if he was comfortable enough to
address this as an outpatient this week or if the dyspnea
progressed over the next day or 2, they would alternatively call
the ambulance and present to the ED. He tried to turn up his
oxygen but to apply the oxygen mask at home he had to go up to
8L or so, and he only had the ability with his compressor to go
up to 5L and he wasn't able to get enough oxygen, and so his
wife called EMS and went to OSH, was given 1.5L NS and
nebulizers. Labs at the OSH were notable for PTT 30, INR 1.3,
BNP 201. WBC 13.6, HCT 41.9, Trop < 0.01, AST 50, ALT 114.

Pt was previously supplied a prednisone taper for shortness of
breath/wheezing for about 1 week, which finished on [**2130-6-27**]. The
patient was last seen in [**Hospital **] clinic on [**2130-6-26**]. He
completed palliative radiation to L3-L4 vertebral metastasis on
[**2130-6-27**]. A discussion was also held about his overall prognosis
given ongoing disease progression in his lungs, despite
palliative irinotecan and cetuximab. The patient was to discuss
this with his family given that his son is planning an [**Month (only) 359**]
wedding, that he was encouraged to move up. Lastly, during this
visit, OxyContin was increased to 30 mg q12h.  At that time, he
was experiencing SOB with any exertion, using O2 2L NC when up
and around. He was scheduled to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3274**] next
on [**7-4**].

In ED, the patient was initially required a non-rebreather for
oxygenation, but then oxygenation improved to 95% on 3L NC.
Vitals were recorded as: T 98.3 ??????F, HR 111, RR 23, BP 143/86, O2
saturation 95% on 3L NC. Physical exam was significant for
wheezing, crackles, RLL decreased BS. A chest x-ray was done,
which showed moderated R sided pleural effusion and bilateral
interstitial abnormalities. Pt was given 2L NS. CTA on [**6-7**] for
DOE was negative for PE and CT torso on [**6-26**] showed infiltrative
multifocal adenocarcinoma metastatic to the lung appears
slightly worse with now increased septal thickening and pleural
scalloping concerning for pleural involvement as well as
increased right pleural effusion since the CTA. Bronchial
brushings from RUL on [**4-24**] were postiive for malignant cells,
consisetn with metastatic colonic adenocarcinoma. Pathology of
the RUL cellblock showed the same thing.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS. Pt appears uncomfortable,
unable to catch his breath. He was given lasix and a nebulizer
and began to feel improvement. An ABG was obtained, which showed
7.42/40/75/27. He was then put on BiPAP.

Past Medical History:
Severe burns on both upper arms, requiring grafting.

Past Oncologic History:
- [**3-/2128**]: Noted progressive rectal discomfort.
- [**2128-4-28**]: Underwent CT scan due to worsening rectal pain. This

revealed focal wall thickening at the rectosigmoid junction,
which was thought to be consistent with a perirectal abscess. He
was put on a course of oral antibiotics and scheduled for a
colonoscopy (he had never had a prior colonoscopy).
- [**2128-5-7**]: Underwent diagnostic colonoscopy with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; a digital rectal exam prior to the procedure revealed a

"hard rectal mass" and, on colonoscopy, he was found to have "a

frond-like villous nonobstructing large mass" within the distal

rectum that was partially circumferential. A biopsy was taken,
pathology of which demonstrated high-grade invasive
adenocarcinoma with signet ring cell features.
- [**2128-5-13**]: Underwent an endoscopic ultrasound with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 487**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 41573**]. This described the mass as being 10 cm in length,
partially circumferential, non-obstructing, and located 0.5 cm
from the anal verge. It localized the mass to the left
posterolateral rectal wall and described "son[**Name (NI) 493**] evidence
suggesting breakthrough of the muscularis propria with invasion

into the perirectal fat ... there appeared to be an extension of
the mass into other adjacent structures, including the internal
anal sphincter". Also noted were "four malignant-appearing lymph
nodes" adjacent to the rectal mass. By EUS criteria, this was
described as a uT3 uN1 lesion.
- [**2128-6-7**]: Began neoadjuvant chemoradiation with infusional 5FU
(225 mg/m2/day); 50.4 Gy radiation given by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]; completed
[**2128-7-15**]
- [**2128-10-4**]: Underwent abdominoperineal resection with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**];

pathology revealed a high-grade signet ring rectal
adenocarcinoma which invaded through the muscularis propria into
the perirectal soft tissues (ypT3); 35 of 36 lymph nodes were
involved with carcinoma (ypN2b); intra-operatively, the left
pelvic sidewall was noted to have suspicious thickened tissue
and radial surgical margins were positive in this area; gold
fiducials were placed intra-operatively to the left pelvic
sidewall; tumor was microsatellite stable (MSS); KRAS wild-type

- [**11-12**] - [**2128-11-18**]: Underwent CyberKnife (25 Gy in five
fractions) to the left pelvic sidewall at the site of his
positive margin.
- 10/26/1: Began cycle 1 of adjuvant chemotherapy with modified

FOLFOX6; completed sixth/final cycle [**2129-5-3**]
- [**2129-9-27**]: CT Torso done to evaluate elevated CEA revealed new
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, two ground-glass opacities in
the right upper and lower lobes of the lungs, and a new 8 mm
lesion at the dome of the liver, all consistent with
recurrent/metastatic disease.
- [**2129-10-31**]: Began cycle 1 of palliative FOLFIRI and bevacizumab;

completed 6 cycles prior to disease progression (confirmed by
transbronchial biopsy of a worsening infiltrative lesion in the

right upper lobe of the lung on [**2130-4-24**])
- [**2130-5-8**]: Began cycle 1 day 1 of palliative weekly irinotecan
(120 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of 28-day cycle) and cetuximab
(250 mg/m2 weekly after 400 mg/m2 loading dose on cycle 1 day 1)

- [**2130-6-21**]: Began palliative radiation to L4 vertebral metastasis

(20 Gy given over five 4 Gy treatments); chemo held during
treatment

Social History:
(per OMR) He lives in [**Location 47**] with his wife,[**Name (NI) **]; they have 3
grown children. His son is currently planning an [**Month (only) 359**]
wedding, which his Oncologists have recommended that date be

most 3 packs/week.


Family History:
(per OMR) Several cousins on the paternal side with breast,
ovarian cancer at young ages, and there is no history of
colorectal cancer or other cancers.
