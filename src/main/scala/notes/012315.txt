Brief Hospital Course:
GI: Admitted to Dr.[**Name (NI) 18535**] [**Name (STitle) 4869**] on [**2133-9-12**] for
right lower quadrant pain.  Abdominal CT demonstrated an
inflamed but non-ruptured appendix.  The pt was taken to the OR
after INR was reversed with FFP, and a laparoscopic appendectomy
was performed without complications. On POD2, diet was advanced
without event and by POD3 the pt was tolerating a regular diet
without nausea or vomiting; in addition, she was passing flatus
and having bowel movements.

CV: Post-operatively, the pt remained intubated for respiratory
failure/congestive heart failure due to afib with a rapid
ventricular response.  The pt was diuresed overnight and weaned
from the ventilator the following morning in the ICU.  Cardiac
workup revealed non-diagnostic ST and T wave changes on EKG and
troponin was 0.02 the following morning.  Cardiac consult was
obtained and determined that the pt had a leak in setting of
demand ischemia due to the rapid ventricular rate. In the ICU,
rate was controlled with a diltiazem drip, which was weaned over
the first day and the pt was transitioned to beta-blockade with
good rate control.  On the floor, the cardiology service
recommended starting diltiazem PO and this was done upon
discharge, POD3.

ID: Pt was febrile on admission, but postoperatively was
afebrile.  WBC on admission were 13.6, maximizing at 16.0 on
POD1.  By POD3, WBCs were 7.5.  The pt was given antibiotics in
the perioperative period, but these were not continued in the
ICU or on the floor.
