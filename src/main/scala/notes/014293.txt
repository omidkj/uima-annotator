Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1267**]
Chief Complaint:
Chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2164-12-17**] Three Vessel Coronary ARtery Bypass Grafting utilizing
left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, and
vein grafts to obtuse marginal and posterior descending artery


History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 yo M w h/o HTN, CAD s/p multiple stents, asthma and
type 2 diabetes presents with CP 3 days after cardiac cath.
Patient states that he developed sharp pain in the center of his
chest, occurring at rest starting last night. He took 10 SL
nitro, and achieved relief of his pain after each dose, but
recurred again. He was able to go to sleep that night. He denied
any radiation of the pain to his neck or arms, or any associated
nausea, diaphoresis, or SOB associated with this chest pain. He
denies any positional component to his pain. He has no fevers,
chills, or productive sputum, but has had a dry cough recently.
He states that this is different from both his asthma and his
GERD, and is also unlike the shortness of breath and jaw
tightness he develops when going up stairs. He does not remember
whether this is his anginal equivalent. He was most recently
seen by his cardiologist for continuing anginal symptoms and at
that time was referred for a cath. This was performed 3 days
ago, and showed 3 vessel disease (LMCA w/80% distal stenosis,
LAD w/ 60% stenosis,  distal LCx w/70% stenosis, first OM w/60%
stenosis, RCA 70% distal stenosis), and patient was scheduled
for CABG. In the ED, he received nitro SL and morphine IV with
relief of his pain. A first set of cardiac enzymes were
negative. His EKG showed minimal ST elevations <1mm in V3/V4,
and he was placed on a Heparin gtt and given BB, ASA, and
subsequently admitted for surgical revascularization.

Reason: evaluate for pneumonia

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
71 year old man s/p cabg now with temps
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate for pneumonia
CHEST

HISTORY: CABG, fever, evaluate for pneumonia.

Two views. Comparison with the previous study of [**2164-12-19**]. There
is streaky density at the lung bases and in the left upper lobe
consistent with subsegmental atelectasis, as before. Blunting of
the posterior costophrenic sulci probably represents very small
pleural effusions. The patient is status post median sternotomy
and CABG. Mediastinal structures are unchanged. The bony thorax
is grossly intact.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral subsegmental atelectasis and possible
small bilateral pleural effusions. Status post median
sternotomy. No significant interval change.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient
was under
general anesthesia throughout the procedure.

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous
echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the
anterior septum and
anterior wall.. The remaining left ventricular segments contract
normally.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are
three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
There is no
aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.

POST CPB: LV systolic function globally improved on inotropic
support
(epinephrine). LVEF now 40 %. Akinetic anteroseptal mid and
apical segments.
Tivial MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] as described. TR is mild. The aortic contour is
intact post
decannulation.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14502**] was admitted to cardiology service. Cardiac enzymes
remained flat. Due to persistent chest pain at rest, he was
maintained on intravenous Heparin and Nitroglycerin. Plavix was
held in anticipation of surgery. His preoperative course was
otherwise unremarkable and he was cleared for surgery. On
[**12-17**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed coronary artery bypass
grafting. For additional surgical details, please see seperate
dictated operative note. Following the operation, he was brought
to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated on postoperative day
one. He experienced bouts of atrial fibrillation which was
initially treated with intravenous Amiodarone. He remained
mostly in a normal sinus rhythm a
