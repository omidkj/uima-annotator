HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Status post aspiration
pneumonia, status post intubation.

The patient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit
on [**2125-7-28**].  His hospital course during the Intensive Care
[**2125-8-9**], to current when he was on the floor.

This is a 70 year old white male admitted from [**Hospital3 36255**] Home on [**2125-7-28**], for coffee ground emesis with
decreased blood pressure, increasing heart rate and mild
upper quadrant pain.  The patient was intubated in the
Emergency Department for hypoxia and airway protection.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].

During the hospital stay, the patient has had several medical
issues, the first being respiratory failure for which he was
intubated.  During the postintubation, the patient's chest
x-ray was clear.  He was on oxygen by face mask, 50% with
oxygen saturation in the mid to high 90% range.  Upon
breathing room air, his oxygen saturation decreases to high
80s.  He was largely noncompliant with keeping his oxygen on due
to his dementia.

Second issue is aspiration pneumonia.  The patient has been
kept NPO.  Nasogastric tube was considered to be placed but
was unable to place given the patient was not able to
swallow.  The patient had a speech and swallow study done and
aspirated several teaspoons of water.  The patient then
underwent a modified barium swallow and this showed that he
also failed the study.  Because the patient is not a candidate
for a feeding tube, he was started on a modified diet and will be
carefully monitored post-discharge at this nursing home.

Episodes of hypotension - The patient has been shown to be
responsive to boluses and has received several 250 cc normal
saline boluses which has brought up his blood pressure.

Congestive heart failure - His hospital course did not
demonstrate any problems associated with congestive heart
failure.

Nutrition - Again, the patient is NPO because of strict
aspiration precautions.  He received D5W at 75 cc/hour of
intravenous fluids and would not receive tube feeds.  The
family has refused a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube
given that the patient has risk of pulling out the tube.  He wil
lbe given a modified diet, as above.

Gastrointestinal bleed - We continued to follow the
hematocrit during hospital course and it demonstrated no
significant drop in hematocrit.  Most recent hematocrit was
high 28.0 for which he received one unit of packed red blood
cells.  He received Protonix throughout the course and had a
rectal tube placed.

Hematology wise, he had a hematocrit in the high 20s, low
30s, below 30 was transfused with one unit.

Renal - He has a history of chronic renal failure but his
creatinine has been stable.

Neurologically, he has a history of being agitated as well as
anxiety.  He receives Depakote and benzodiazepines throughout
the hospital course.  Code Status is DNR/DNI.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  On discharge, the patient is in
stable condition and will return back to [**Hospital3 **]
Home.
