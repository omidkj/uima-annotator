Chief Complaint:
hip fracture

History of Present Illness:
70yo man with ESRD not yet on HD, DM, PVD who initially
presented s/p fall while getting out of bed in setting of
hypoglycemia and poor appetite. He landed on his R hip and
sustained a displaced femoral neck fracture. He was found by his
son on the floor next to his bed, who called EMS. On arrival to
an OSH he was found to have FS 36 and the above fracture and he
was sent to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management. He was recently
treated at an outside hospital from [**Date range (1) 61322**] for a R great toe
cellulitis and was discharged to home on IV antibiotics
(imipenem and zyvox). He was found to have a necrotic R great
toe on arrival. He was medically cleared for the OR and had a
hemiarthroplasty of the R hip, immediate post op period was
complicated by DKA and the patient was sent to the micu, where
he was kept on an insulin drip for one day. Since then he has
had very volatile FS, running between very elevated and quite
low. [**Last Name (un) **] has been following and with their recs the pt's FS
have been stable off D5 for the last 24 hours.
.
[**Hospital 1094**] hospital course has also been complicated by hospital
acquired LLL pneumonia for which he is being treated with
vanco/zosyn, MS changes believed to be due to
narcotics/psychotropic meds, development of a coccygeal
decubitus pressure ulcer, and elevated INR in setting of
coumadin use s/p femoral fracture (avoiding lovenox given CRI).
He has been followed by renal, ID, [**Last Name (un) **], [**Last Name (un) 1106**] surgery and
orthopedic surgery throughout his stay.
.
ROS: pt reports mild pain in his r hip and r toe. no cp, no sob,
no other complaints. eating well.

AP PELVIS AND AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE RIGHT FEMUR. There is
a right subcapital/transcervical femoral fracture with superior
displacement of the distal fracture with limb shortening. There
is varus angulation of the fragments. The femoral head
articulates with the acetabulum appropriately. The left femoral
neck appears intact. No fractures are detected involving the

AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:
Dating back to [**2147-4-26**], there has been interval
development of left lower lobe consolidation obscuring the left

tip is seen within the mid SVC. No evidence of pneumothorax or
pleural effusions. Osseous and soft tissue structures are
unremarkable.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

AORTA AND BRANCHES
AORTA AND BRANCHES U/S [**2147-5-8**] 1:15 PM

The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber measuring 2.3 cm in
maximal diameter and showing no focal aneurysmal dilatation.
There is some elevated atherosclerotic plaque in the distal
abdominal aorta and at the iliac bifurcation. These plaques do
not compromise flow, however. The possibility of the plaques
being a source for peripheral emboli cannot be assessed by this
technique. Iliac arteries are normal in caliber bilaterally.

Cardiology Report ECHO Study Date of [**2147-5-10**]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 60% (nl >=55%)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
LA/LAA or the  RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum. No
ASD or PFO by  2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with
maneuvers.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV systolic function.

AORTA: No atheroma in aortic arch. Simple atheroma in descending
aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No
masses or
vegetations on aortic valve. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. No mass or
vegetation on mitral  valve. Physiologic MR (within normal
limits).

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. No mass or
vegetation on  tricuspid valve. Physiologic TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets.
No
vegetation/mass on pulmonic valve.

Conclusions:
1. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body
of the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is
seen by 2D,
color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
2.Overall left ventricular systolic function is probably normal
(LVEF>55%),
however, the probe was not passed beyond the GE junction and
transgastric
views were not obtained.
3.Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
4.There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No masses
or vegetations
are seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
6.The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. No mass or
vegetation is
seen on the mitral valve. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is
seen (within
normal
