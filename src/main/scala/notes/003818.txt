Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3151**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right femoral central venous line placement ([**6-11**]).
PICC line placement ([**6-13**]).

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 51 y/o woman with PMHx of T1-T2 paraplegia
following MVC [**1-4**], COPD and recent admission for PNA on
[**5-29**]-4/30 who presented to her PCP today with hypoxia, lethargy,
cough and increased work of breathing. Of note, she was
discharged on [**5-31**] after a two day hospital stay for PNA and
COPD exacerbation. She was treated with a short course of
Levofloxacin and steroid taper. Per husband, pt has been doing
well for the last week and has been out socializing and feeling
well. However, she was notably tachypneic, satting in the 80s
and requiring increased NC oxygen this morning. He brought her
in for evaluation in [**Company 191**] and they referred her into the ED for
further evaluation.

In the ED, initial vs were: T 97.9 P 110 BP 109/84 R 24 O2 sat
97% on NRB. Pt underwent CXR which showed bilateral hazy
opacities at bases, essentially unchanged from prior film on
[**5-30**]. CTA was performed for hypoxia but did not show any PE,
there was bilateral atelectasis with RLL consolidations. Blood &
Urine Cx were sent and pt had right femoral line placed before
she was given 1L NS, Vanc and Zosyn for possible PNA. Per [**Name (NI) **], pt
became more somnolent with ABG showing pH 7.34 pCO2 64 pO2 62.
She was given Solumedrol 125mg IV, alb/atrovent and was placed
on BIPAP to treat a component of COPD exacerbation and CO2
retention.

On arrival to the ICU, pt was wearing BIPAP and complaining
about the discomfort of the mask. Overall, she was still
somnolent and husband provided most of the history.

Review of systems: as above, provided by husband. Denies fevers,
chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chest pain, med changes,
rash, cough. Husband did note increased somnolence while eating
and snoring while asleep.

CTA chest ([**2148-6-11**]):
1. Assessment for pulmonary embolism within the segmental and
subsegmental pulmonary arterial branches is limited due to
suboptimal bolus timing. No
evidence of pulmonary embolism in the main pulmonary arteries.
2. Moderate-to-severe bibasilar atelectasis, predominately
within the right
lower lobe. A more consolidative element within the right lower
lobe along
with a new lingular patchy opacity may reflect an infectious
process.
3. Paraseptal emphysema.
4. Unchanged chronic rib cage deformities.

Brief Hospital Course:
51 y/o woman with PMHx of T1-T2 paraplegia, COPD and recurrent
PNAs who presents after recent discharge with respiratory
distress and somnolence, concern for new RLL infiltrate.

# Respiratory Distress: Mixed hypoxic/hypercarbic resp failure.
Pt with COPD and recurrent PNAs who developped tachypnea,
increased O2 requirement, cough and lethargy acutely this
morning. She was referred into the ED by her PCP and underwent [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
CTA that was negative for PE but revealed RLL consolidation,
unclear if new or resolving from prior admission. Pt became
increasingly somnolent in the ED with pCO2 in 60s. In the ED she
got steroids, alb/atrov and BIPAP, with improved mental status
and minimal O2 requirement. Given increased WBC and possible
consolidation and recent hospital admission, she was treated for
HAP with cefepime and vancomycin. A PICC line was placed so that
she could complete a 7-day course of antibiotics. There was
concern of recurrent aspiration. Patient underwent a speech and
swallow eval and passed. Her diet was restarted.  Her initial
PICC placed at the bedside went up the right IJ, so it was
removed and replaced by interventional radiology.  [**2148-6-12**] she
had hypotension and a low-grade fever to 100.7 at 1am.  She was
given fluids and looked well clinically.  Her CXR was unchanged,
U/A was negative and blood cultures had no growth at the time of
discharge. Her vancomycin was originally dosed 1250mg Q24 hours,
but a trough level was 3.8, so the dosing was changed to 1000mg
Q12 hours for the remainder of the course.

# T1-T2 Paraplegia with chronic pain: pt is maintained on
multiple sedating drugs for spasms and pain. She presented with
respiratory distress and progressive somnolence and hypercarbia.
Suspect a component of obesity hypoventilation with possible
aspiration PNA. During this admission, her clonazpeam,
pregabalin, and trazodone were initially held. Baclofen was
decreased to 5 mg tid. Methadone and oxybutynin were continued
at outpatient doses.  Her pregabalin and trazodone were added
back on, but her Baclofen was continued at 5mg TID with some
minor leg spasticity, but adequate pain control.  She was
switched to Ultram for breakthrough pain, but did not find this
effective, so she was switched back to Oxycodone.  She was
discharged, finally, on the same doses of methadone and
oxycodone, a reduced dose of baclofen, and off of Klonopin.  She
was given 2 weeks of methadone and oxycodone to last until she
can see Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 665**] because she was supposed to get refills the
day of her admission but ended up being transferred to the ED.
.
# Possible UTI: Urine Cx from [**5-29**] grew out +enterococcus
>100,000 and this was not treated, possibly thought to be
contaminant. Repeat UAs appeared bland without WBCs and she
remained asymptomatic, so any possible UTI was probably treated
with vanco/cefepime.
.
# Access: She originally had a right femoral CVL, which was
pulled once she was stabilized.
