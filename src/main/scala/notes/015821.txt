HOSPITAL COURSE:  He was admitted to the hospital for a
cardiac catheterization and found to have multivessel disease
and cardiothoracic surgery was consulted at that time.

The patient was scheduled for carotid duplex prior to his
coronary artery bypass graft which was found to be normal.
The patient was taken to the operating room on [**2118-10-14**],
where a coronary artery bypass graft times five was
performed, left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending, saphenous vein graft to OM1 and 2, saphenous vein
graft to ramus and radial artery to the right coronary
artery.  The patient was transferred postoperatively to the
CSRU where he did well, slightly hypertensive overnight, but
is able to be weaned from his ventilator and extubated.  He
was given Lopressor intravenous for his high blood pressure
and he responded.  He was given Toradol for pain.
Postoperative day number one, his Morphine was switched to
Percocet, and the patient was started on Isosorbide and his
diet was advanced.  He continued to improve.   The patient
was transferred to the floor on [**2118-10-15**], where he did well.
His chest tube was removed.  He was out of bed and physical
therapy was consulted for ambulation.  Beta blockers and

wires were removed and the patient was on aggressive
pulmonary toilet.  The patient was watched.  Postoperatively,
