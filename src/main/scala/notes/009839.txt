CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate pleural effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
60 year old man s/p CABG
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate pleural effusions
INDICATION: 60-year-old man, status post CABG, evaluate pleural
effusions.

COMPARISON: Study from [**2129-11-15**]

PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS: Again seen are median
sternotomy wires and clips from prior surgery. There is mild
cardiomegaly. The lungs are clear. The pulmonary vasculature is
within normal limits. No pneumothorax is seen. Again seen are
small bilateral pleural effusions. The soft tissue and osseous
structures are stable in appearance.

IMPRESSION: Small bilateral pleural effusions.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
DR. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5650**] [**Name (STitle) **]

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The patient received antibiotic prophylaxis. The
TEE probe was
passed with assistance from the anesthesioology staff using a
laryngoscope.
The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the
procedure. Resting
bradycardic (HR<60bpm). Results were personally reviewed with
the MD caring
for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data

Conclusions:
PRE-BYPASS:

1. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal
(LVEF 50-55%).
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. Resting regional
wall motion
abnormalities include hypokinesis of inferior wall. The
remaining left
ventricular segments contract normally.
2. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is
no aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
3. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral
regurgitation. No ASD by 2D and color Doppler.
4. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch.
5. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
6. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

[**Location (un) **] PHYSICIAN:


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 6164**] was admitted and underwent routine preoperative
evaluation. Given recent history of Taxus stent, he was
maintained on Plavix. He remained pain free on medical therapy
and intravenous Heparin. Workup was unremarkable and he was
cleared for surgery. On [**11-14**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1290**] performed
coronary artery bypass grafting. Surgery was uncomplicated and
he was brought to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. For further
surgical details, please see seperate dictated operative note.
Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without incident. He maintained stable hemodynamics as
diuretics and low dose beta blockade was resumed. On
postoperative day one, he transferred to the SDU for continued
care and recovery. He worked with physical therapy. Over several
days, he continued to make clinical improvement with diuresis.
Beta blockade was advanced as tolerated. He remained in a normal
sinus rhythm. He was started on Keflex for some erythema at a
LLE vein harvest site. He continued to do well and was ready for
discharge on post operative day 6 with VNA services
