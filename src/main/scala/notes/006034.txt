Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
Endocarditis septic shock [**3-18**] MRSA bactermia, transfer for ICD
lead removal

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Removal of Implantable Cardioverter Difibrillator


History of Present Illness:
65 yo M with Hx of CAD with inferior MI (95) c/b post-infarction
VSD urgently repaired at same time of single vessel bypass (SVG
to RCA), recurrent VSD s/p repair, then out-of-hospital V Fib
arrest (successfully resucitated) s/p additional single vessel
bypass surgery (LIMA to LAD), additional VSD repair with
residual shunting, and implantation of ICD. Additionally,
patient has a hx of paroxysmal AFib/Flutter and is s/p
successful electrical cardioversion on [**2161-3-18**] performed [**3-18**]
worsening heart failure symptoms.
.
He presented to [**Hospital 732**] [**Hospital 107**] Hospital in [**Location (un) 90158**], NY on
[**2161-3-29**] with complaints of fever, chills, and cough X 3 days. He
was found to have a leukocytosis (16) with impressive bandemia
(27), anion-gap metabolic acidosis, hypotension, possible PNA
and AOCKI.
.
Ultimately the patient developed septic shock secondary to MRSA
bacteremia with subsequent multi-organ failure requiring
hemodialysis. He was treated with Vancomycin and Rifampin
without clearance of blood cultures, and continued to experience
rigors. TEE revealed a vegetation attached to the lead closest
to the interatrial septum (within the RA) and a second
vegetation as the lead crosses the tricuspid valve. He initially
required dopamine and levophed for hypotension, and intermittent
BiPAP ventilation. Per report, he was shocked inappropriately
multiple times for runs of SVT and rapid A Fib, so he was
started on IV Amiodarone (now transitioned to oral).
The patient was transferred to our facility for ICD lead
extraction and management of his MRSA endocarditis.
.
Currently the patient reports he feels alright. He is without
chest pain, and his dyspnea is improving. He is having
persistent hiccups.
.
On review of systems, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for + dyspnea on exertion,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, LE edema, and intermittent
palpitations. Also absence of chest pain, orthopnea, syncope or
presyncope.

Radiology:
CXR [**2161-4-8**]:
REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Heart failure in a patient with infected
ICD leads.

Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed with no prior studies
available for comparison.

Pacemaker leads terminate in right ventricle with the second
lead not clearly seen on the current study. The right internal
jugular line tip is at the level of low SVC. Cardiomediastinal
silhouettes demonstrate prior sternotomy and mild cardiomegaly.
The evaluation of the lung parenchyma demonstrates nodular
opacities projecting over the right lung that might represent
unusual appearance of pulmonary edema, but infectious process
would be a consideration. Evaluation of the patient after
diuresis is suggested and if findings persist, further
evaluation with chest CT would be highly recommended. Small
amount of bilateral pleural effusion cannot be excluded, in
particular on the left given the relatively significant distance
between the gastric bubble and the low cardiac border that might
suggest subpulmonic effusion on the left.
.
TTE [**2161-4-9**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35%). A left ventricular mass/thrombus
cannot be excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. The
right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral
valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
quality. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. The estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. [In the setting of
at least moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation, the
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure may be
underestimated due to a very high right atrial pressure.] There
is no pericardial e
