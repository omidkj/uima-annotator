Imaging
CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2182-2-10**]
1. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.
2. Stable appearance of the brain with enlargement of the
ventricles and
extra-axial spaces.

CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST [**2182-2-10**]
1. Early high grade small-bowel obstruction likely of the
proximal ileum at the point of an umbilical hernia. Normal bowel
wall enhancement is seen
without evidence of pneumatosis. There is no free air to suggest
perforation.

2. Enlarged bladder with gas within it. A Foley catheter is seen
with its
balloon expanded within the membranous urethra. The prostate is
enlarged.
Reflux hydronephrosis is present, with a delayed nephrogram.

3. Luminal thickening of the left iliac vein is consistent with
remodeling of chronic iliac thrombus. Flattened IVC signifies
intravascular depletion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66722**] was evaluated in the emergency room. He was then
taken to the operating room where he had a small bowel resection
and hernia repair for his incarcerated hernia after receiving
two units of FFP to reverse his INR. Intraoperative Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
found Incarcerated fat, omentum, and small intestines with
partial hemorrhage of the bowel wall, and a supraumbilical
ventral hernia. Please see the operative report for full
details.

He had 24 hours of zosyn periopertively, was initially kept NPO
on IVF, with a foley for urine output monitoring. He was
switched to cipro IV after the zosyn was completed for his UTI.
His urine culture sensitvities came back as proteus mirabilis
resistant to cipro and he was switched to ceftriaxone.

On [**2-13**] he was advanced to a regular diet and switched to PO
meds including pain medication. He was restarted on coumadin.

On [**2-14**] his abdomen became distended and a KUB was obtained
which did not show obvious ileus. His foley was exchanged as it
had become blocked and his distension resolved.

He was switched to miniCoumadin (1 mg daily) for his pelvic DVT.
His telemetry was discontinued as he had been stable for the
duration of his stay on the floor.

The rest of his floor stay was uneventfu. He was discharged to
his long term care facility on [**2-17**] with follow up with his
surgeon, his urologist for his chronic indwelling foley, and
with his PCP for his chronic leg swelling. He had staples in
place which should be discontinued one week after discharge at
follow up with his surgeon.

This patient was cared for and managed by the rotating attending
surgeons of the acute care surgical service.
