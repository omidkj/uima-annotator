Service:  CARDIAC [**Doctor First Name **]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 82 year old female
who has a known history of aortic stenosis and coronary
artery disease, who reports increasing dyspnea on exertion
over the last several years.  The patient was referred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac
catheterization.

The cardiac catheterization showed an ejection fraction of
55%, left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 20, aortic
valve area of 0.5 cm squared, peak aortic valve gradient of
72 and 100% proximal right coronary artery lesion.

An echocardiogram of [**2163-1-24**] showed moderate concentric
left ventricular hypertrophy, ejection fraction of 65%.
aortic stenosis with trace aortic insufficiency, peak aortic
gradient of 117 mm of mercury and mean aortic gradient of 88
mm of mercury, mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild mitral
regurgitation.

The patient was referred to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for surgery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
2.  Aortic stenosis.
3.  Glaucoma.
4.  Status post partial colectomy in [**2151**] for colon
carcinoma.
5.  History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
6.  Osteoarthritis.
7.  Status post hernia repair times two.
8.  Status post tonsillectomy.
9.  Status post percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty to left anterior descending in [**2152**].

PREOPERATIVE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Imdur 60 mg p.o. q. day.
2.  Betapace 80 mg p.o. twice a day.
3.  Corgard 10 mg p.o. twice a day.
4.  Lipitor 5 mg p.o. q. day.
5.  Xanax 0.25 mg p.o. three times a day.
6.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q. day.
7.  Cardizem 60 mg p.o. q. a.m. and 30 mg p.o. q. p.m. and 30
mg p.o. q. h.s.
8.  Xalatan eye drops, two drops o.u. q. a.m.
9.  Alphagan eye drops, two drops o.u. three times a day.

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 346**] on [**2163-3-1**].  She was taken to
the Operating Room for an aortic valve replacement with a 19
mm [**Last Name (un) 3843**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] pericardial valve and a coronary artery
bypass graft times one, saphenous vein graft to the right
coronary artery with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Total coronary pulmonary
bypass time was 115 minutes; cross clamp time 88 minutes.
Please see operative note for further details.  The patient
was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in stable
condition.

On the first postoperative evening, the patient awoke and
followed commands; however, the patient was slow to extubate
from mechanical ventilation as she was slow to fully awake.
Postoperatively she was weaned and extubated on postoperative
day number one without difficulty.  The patient required
Neo-Synephrine on postoperative day one to maintain adequate
blood pressure.  The patient was started on Lasix with good
response.  On postoperative day number two, the patient had
an episode of atrial fibrillation.  The patient was started
on Amiodarone.

As the patient was on Sotalol preoperatively, an
Electrophysiology Service consultation was obtained and they
initially recommended restarting the Sotalol.  The patient
converted to sinus rhythm and maintained sinus rhythm for
less than 24 hours and again had an episode of atrial
fibrillation.  The patient was started on Lopressor as well.

On postoperative day number three, the patient was
transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the regular part
of the hospital.  The patient continued to have episodes of
atrial fibrillation and the patient's Sotalol had been
discontinued.  Electrophysiology Service was again consulted
and they recommended anti-coagulation and cardioversion if
patient remained in atrial fibrillation; however, the
patient's platelet count postoperatively had decreased.

On postoperative day three, the patient's platelet count had
dropped to 62.  Heparin antibody was sent and it was
subsequently negative and the patient's platelet count began
to rise.  The patient was started on heparin for
anti-coagulation.

On postoperative day number six, the patient was taken to the
Electrophysiology Service Laboratory where she underwent a
transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out thrombus in her
atria.  The echocardiogram showed no clot, normal left
ventricular function, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation,
mild tricuspid regurgitation and no pericardial effusion.

Cardioversion was attempted by the Electrophysiology Service
and the patient had a very brief episode of sinus rhythm
again converted into atrial fibrillation.  It was recommended
by the Electrophysiology Service to load the patient on
Amiodarone and if the patient continued in atrial
fibrillation after a month on Amiodarone and
anti-coagulation, to again attempt cardioversion.

The patient began working with Physical Therapy.  It was
recommended by Physical Therapy that the patient could
benefit from a stay at a short term rehabilitation.  By
postoperative day number seven, the patient was cleared for a
discharge to rehabilitation and she will be discharged on
postoperative day number eight.

q. day.
9.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. twice a day.
10. Coumadin; the patient should receive a daily dose after

greater than 1.5.
