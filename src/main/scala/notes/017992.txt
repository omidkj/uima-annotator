Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2777**]
Chief Complaint:
Thoracic Aortic Ulcer, acute renal failure (bilateral stenosis)


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Angiogram with angioplasty/stenting of renal arteries [**2120-11-15**]


History of Present Illness:
 68 y/o F with a past medical history of hypertension,
non-alcoholic pancreatitis presented to an OSH on [**11-9**] with
sudden-onset [**7-16**] back pain radiating to the epigastrum.  CT
scan done showed a probable type B aortic dissection. She was
transferred to the Vascular service at [**Hospital1 18**] for further care.
On arrival, BPs were 200/100 and patient was placed on an
esmolol drip. CT scan done here showed intra-aortic intramural
hematomas, penetrating ulcer in aortic arch, and significant
right renal artery stenosis/thrombosis.  Decision was made to
medically manage the aortic hematomas with blood pressure
control. Creatinine on arrival was 1.2.  Patient became oligutic
during the day on [**11-10**], and creatinine increased to 2.0 this
morning.

Vascular surgery, cardiac surgery and nephrology consulted for
management of her overall care.

CT
1. High density within the wall of the aorta, on correlation
with the recent CT, imaging features are suggestive of an
intramural hematoma.
2. Delayed excretion of contrast from the left kidney consistent
with renal dysfunction.

US
1. The right kidney is noted to be smaller than the left kidney.

2. No hydronephrosis and no perinephric fluid collection
identified.
3. Very low velocity of flow identified within the right kidney
as compared to the left kidney. Limited Doppler study.

MRI
1. Penetrating ulcer within the arch of the aorta with an
associated
intramural hematoma, which arises below the level of the left
subclavian
artery (type B). Follow up MR imaging in [**1-10**] weeks to further
assess changes in the hematoma is advised.
2. Tight stenosis of the right renal artery and a small right
kidney is
present.
3. Mild stenosis of the left (lower) renal artery.

US
No evidence of acute deep venous thrombosis in both lower
extremities.

RUS
1. The right kidney is noted to be smaller than the left kidney.

2. No hydronephrosis and no perinephric fluid collection
identified.
3. Very low velocity of flow identified within the right kidney
as compared
to the left kidney. Limited Doppler study.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the cardiac surgery service on [**2120-11-10**]
for careful observation and monitoring for concerns of expanding
intramural hematoma. She was observed at the CVICU for strict
monitoring of blood pressure (SBP< 140). For her worsening renal
failure (given rising Cr and oliguria), renal consulted and
likely etiology contrast nephropathy with chronic renal
stenosis. She was taken to the operating room on [**2120-11-15**] for
angiogram, renal artery stenting and angioplasty. She had a
normal postoperative course and will be discharged [**2120-11-17**].

Her hospital stay can be summarized by the following review of
systems -

Neuro: Pt pain controlled with iv and oral narcotics. She will
be discharged on oxycodone and nicotine patch.

Pulm: Pt with h/o COPD and exhibited some hypoxia during
hospital course - unclear etiology but responded with nebulizer
treatments. She is otherwise asymptomatic and stable, normal
mentation. She continues to be on room air on discharge, SaO2>
93% on room air.

Cardio: BP control critical in setting of intramural hematoma
and bilateral renal artery stenosis. She was on multiple
anti-hypertensive (5) and even esmolol with nicardipine gtt.
After procedure, she was no longer on any drips and BP
controlled on amlodipine, metoprolol, and dyazide on discharge.
Angiogram showed normal aorta despite findings on MRI. She will
be discharged on ASA325 and to follow up with cardiac surgery
clinic in 4 weeks; will obtain MRA of torso in 3 weeks to be
follow up in clinc. Her hypertensive regimen was changed and PCP
will be notified.

GI: Tolerating regular diet. On ranitidine for H2B prophylaxis.

Renal: Acute/chronic RF with Cr 1.2 at baseline. With acute
renal failure, Cr did rise to 2.0 w/ oliguria. Now s/p bilateral
renal artery stenosis angioplasty with stenting. After her
procedure, Cr did decrease to 1.5 on discharge. She continues to
make > 1.5L/24 hrs of urine. She will be discharged and follow
up with nephrology outpatient for close monitoring, labs,
ultrasound. Her home lisinopril will be held given renal
failure.

Heme: to be discharged on ASA. She was maintained on SQH as
inpatient. LENI did not show any DVT's for concerns that PE was
causing her respiratory hypoxia. However, she was weaned to room
air on discharge with no other symptoms.
