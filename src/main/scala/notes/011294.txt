History of Present Illness:
80M HTN, h/o CVA, h/o presyncope with known conduction system
disease, h/o SVT, recent admission in [**2159-1-15**] for afib and CHF
exacerbation. Was discharged on Toprol XL for rate control and
on coumadin with plan for 3 weeks of anticoagulation prior to
elective DCCV. Last seen in cardiology clinic on [**2-21**] and had
been doing well. Scheduled for elective DCCV this week.
.
On day of presentation, was walking to refrigerator. Syncope
witnessed by wife. [**Name (NI) **] that he knew he was going to faint [**2-17**]
seconds prior to losing consciousness and was able to brace fall
with arm, landing on his rear. Wife did not note any tonic
clonic movements. No bowel/bladder incontinence. No preceding
CP, SOB, n/v, diaphoresis, palps, or aura. Was out for several
seconds, followed by 15 seconds of filling "dizzy".
.
States symptoms are similar to prior episodes of presyncope,
except that this episode actually led to LOC, whereas prior
episodes had resolved without intervention.
.
In ED, non-contrast head CT negative for acute bleed.

Pertinent Results:
studies:
[**2-27**] head ct:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN: There is no evidence of acute
intracranial hemorrhage or shift of the normally midline
structures. The ventricles and sulci are prominent, consistent
with involutional change. There is hypodensity of the cerebral
periventricular white matter, consistent with chronic
microvascular infarction. There are unchanged rounded
infarctions of the right thalamus and a small lacunar infarction
of the posterolateral left thalamus. Hypodensity of the left
cerebellar hemisphere is unchanged, consistent with prior
infarction. There are no CT findings to suggest acute
territorial infarction on today's exam. There are mucus
retention cysts in the floors of the maxillary antrum
bilaterally. Other visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air
cells are clear. Osseous and soft tissue structures are
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.
Unchanged appearance of the brain compared to [**2158-2-15**]
.
cxr [**2-27**]: IMPRESSION: Stable radiographic examination with right
pleural effusion, cardiomegaly, and pulmonary arterial
hypertension, without acute superimposed consolidation.
.
carotid us [**2-28**]: IMPRESSION: Widely patent common and internal
carotid arteries bilaterally.
.
ruq us [**3-2**] IMPRESSION:
1. No apparent biliary or hepatic parenchymal abnormality to
explain hyperbilirubinemia.
2. Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
3. Unchanged subcentimeter right hepatic simple cyst.
.
[**2159-3-7**] cath:
COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
single vessel disease. The LMCA, LAD, and RCA had no obstructive

lesions. The LCX gave off a large OM1 with a hazy 90% lesion.
2. Left ventriculography revealed an ejection fraction of 30%
with
global hypokinesis and no mitral regurgitation.
3. LVEDP was elevated at 20mmHg.
4. During angiography of the left system, the patient had a
asystolic
arrest. As pacer pads were being placed, he transitioned to
complete
heart block with a ventricular escape in the 40s. He was
hypotensive
with SBP in the 40s to 60s. Venous access was obtained and a
transvenous
pacer was successfully placed.
5. Succesful PCI of CX using overlapping bare metal stents
(3.0x12mm
proximal to a 2.5x12mm).

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
3. Successful bare metal stenting of the circumflex system
.
[**2159-3-8**] echo:
Conclusions:
The left and right atria are markedly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
depressed, with moderate global hypokinesis (EF 35%). The right
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There is mild global right
ventricular free wall hypokinesis. The aortic root is mildly
dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. An
eccentric jet of moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
A pacemaker lead is seen entering the right atrium, then
traversing the interatrial septum and the mitral valve, with the
lead tip positioned in the trabeculations of the left
ventricular apex.
IMPRESSION: Pacemaker lead at the left ventricular apex.
Moderate global left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Mild
right ventricular systolic dysfunction. Moderate mitral
regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-1-23**],
pacemaker lead is new. The other findings appear similar


Brief Hospital Course:
Brief CCU course: The patient is a 80 year old man with h/o
atrial fibrillation, HTN, h/o CVA, h/o SVT, admitted with
presyncope, who had DCCV on [**2159-2-28**]. This lead to sinus
bradycardia and then Atrial tachycardia with 2:1 block. He was
started on dofetilide that night. He underwent DCCV on [**2159-3-1**].
At 2:55 am on [**2159-3-2**] noted to be in NSVT with long interval
pauses (WT 480 with long RR and PVC on tele). Pt found pulseless
and a code blue was called.  The patient was shocked x 3 with
360 J for vtach. Given CPR and went in to PEA arrest. CPR
resumed, got a pulse at 3:08 am per CCU notes (epi x 3, atropine
x 2, bicarb x 2) He was intubated.
.
In the CCU, pt was extubated successfully. There was question of
anoxic brain injury as the patient was not responding when taken
off of propofol. However, he has continued to progress
neurologically. Neurology team did evaluate him on [**2159-3-2**].
Given his rapid improvement thought to be encourarging. However,
could not rule out milder hypoxic-ischemic injury. Noted to have
fevers with CXR consistent with a PNA. Started on vancomycin and
levaquin on [**2159-3-2**] in the am.  The patient was stable and
tranferred to the floor.  On the floor his SVT was treated with
a beta-blocker and his abx were stopped as he had no signs of
infection.  He remained stable on the floor and then went to
cardiac catheterization which was interrupted by CHB and
ventricular
