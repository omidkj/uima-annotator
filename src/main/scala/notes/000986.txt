Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o man with h/o Afib, aortic stenosis, SSS s/p pacer, s/p
remote right total hip arthroplasty with right iliac crest
hematoma in setting of supratherapeutic INR (19).
.
1. Hematoma: He appears to have developed a retroperitoneal
bleed by CT scan read as a right iliacus muscle hematoma, which
most likely developed spontaneously in the setting of a
supratherapeutic INR.  There did not appear to be any
hemarthrosis.  He did not have any history of trauma to the hip
and his last surgery was 10-15 years ago.  Vascular surgery was
consulted and followed Mr [**Known lastname 69679**] throughout his hospitalization.
 He was transfused, in total, 4 units of FFP and 4 units of
pRBC, for a discharge Hct of 31.5.  His coumadin was d/c on
admission, and he his INR subsequently decreased to 1.4 on
discharge.  He was advised not to continue his coumadin until he
was seen by his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 2429**], and they would make a decision
together about whether or not the risks outweigh the benefits of
continuing his coumadin.  We monitored his UOP and BUN/Cr for
any obstruction secondary to the hematoma.  He had no issues in
regards to this.
.
# CHF: EF 60% with severe AS
The patient did have flash pulmonary in the ED with an initial
1L NS bolus, and was diuresed secondary to this.  He was
monitored carefully during his blood transfusions for signs of
fluid overload, and he received Lasix after his units of blood
and FFP.  He diuresed appropriately with good UOP, and did not
develop any shortness of breath during his transfusions.
.
# Agitation: The patient was intermittently confused and
agitated, especially at night.  He required some Haldol for one
night, and subsequently only required a 1:1 sitter to keep him
safe. He was otherwise alert and oriented times three.
.
# Afib: Continue digoxin, which had a therapeutic level during
hospitalization; holding anticoagulation, V-paced.
.
# HTN: His amlodipine was held during his acute bleeding event
to prevent hypotension and to monitor the bleeding better.  It
was restarted upon discharge.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Atorvastatin was continued during the
hospitalization.
.
# Dementia: Aricept was continued throughout his
hospitalization.
.
# FEN: The patient was maintained NPO until he stabilized, when
he tolerated a regular diet well.  His electrolytes were
repleted as needed.
.
# Insomnia: Benadryl prn as pt home regimen
.
# PPx: pneumoboots; bowel regimen given oxycodone pain control
.
