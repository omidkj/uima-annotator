diaphoresis and palpitations

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:

History of Present Illness:
53 year old lady, with history significant for insulin dependent
diabetes for 30 yrs, and multiple medicle issues who presented
on [**2200-7-7**] to [**Hospital3 3583**] with substernal chest pain and
shortness of breath, with onset at rest. On arrival to [**Hospital1 3325**] the Troponin was  slightly elevated to 0.3 and the EKG
had ST-T abnormalities (ST depressions in V4-V6, T wave
inversions in aVL). A nuclear stress test was positive.

She underwent cardiac catheterization showing multivessel
disease and revascularization was recommended, for which the
patient was trasnferred here on family request.  Of note the
[**Hospital3 3583**] course also complicated by hypertensive urgency,
acute on chronic renal failure and cellulitis at the site of a
right antecubital intravenous, for which she is being treated
with doxycycline.

Pertinent Results:
[**2200-7-14**] CXR (portable AP):
FINDINGS: No previous images. Cardiac silhouette is mildly
enlarged but there is no vascular congestion, pleural effusion,
or acute focal pneumonia.
[**2200-7-14**] Carotid Ultrasound:
1. 60-69% right internal carotid artery stenosis and less than
40% stenosis on the left internal carotid artery.
2. Atherosclerotic plaques in the internal carotid arteries
bilaterally.

Echo 1. Left atrium - No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in
the body of the left atrium. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is
present in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. Left ventricle - There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=
40-45 %).
3. Right ventricle - Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal.
4. Aorta - There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta.
There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are complex
(>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. Aortic valve - The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen.
6. Mitral valve - The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. Pericardium - There is a very small pericardial effusion.
8. Pleural effusion - A left pleural effusion is seen.
POST-BYPASS: On phenylephrine infusion, a pacing. Improved
biventricular systolic function. LVEF is now 55%. MR is trace.
Aortic contour is normal post decannulation.

CXR [**8-4**]
FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**8-1**], allowing for
obliquity of the patient, there is probably little overall
change. Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists with
extensive sternal metallic devices after surgery. No definite
vascular congestion or pleural effusion.

[**7-28**] renal u/s
The right and left kidneys measure 10.8 and 10.4 cm
respectively. Both
kidneys are normal in appearance, without hydronephrosis, stones
or renal
masses. Doppler analysis of the main and segmental renal
arteries were
performed in both kidneys. There is normal symmetric arterial
waveforms in
both kidneys, with resistive indices ranging from 0.72 x 0.87 on
the right and 0.70 to 0.81 on the left. Normal flow is seen in
both renal veins.
IMPRESSION: Limited study demonstrating symmetric renal arterial
waveforms in both kidneys, without evidence for renal artery
stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was transferred in for surgical evaluation, of note the LV
gram indicated EF 35% with mild peripheral edema and was treated
with ACE inhibitor and betablocker preop op, repeat
echocardiogram preoperatively revealed EF 60%.  Additionally she
was taken off aggrenox for wash out prior surgery.  Her renal
function was monitored with creatinine 2 on admission that was
her baseline.  Additionally she had been treated for right arm
cellulitis at outside hospital and was on doxycycline at the
time of transfer, and was resolved prior to surgery.  In
relation to neuro it was noted that she had been progressingly
having issues with short term memory and was drastically worse
since admission at outside hospital but there was no focal
deficits.   There was a question of NSTEMI but based on
information the troponin 0.03 with elevated creatinine and CK
61, this is not definitive for NSTEMI and enzymes were normal on
transfer. Also she was significantly hypertensive and
antihypertensives were adjusted for management.

On [**2200-7-18**] she was brought to the operating room for coronary
artery bypass graft surgery, see operative report for further
details.  She was transferred to the CVICU in stable condition
on propofol dri
