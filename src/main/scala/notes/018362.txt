History of Present Illness:
77 year old man with h/o stage IB (pT2aN0Mx) Squamous NSCLC s/p
right lower [**Month/Day/Year 3630**] wedge resection ([**2144-2-8**]), presenting with
lung/pleural and rib mets with extrinsic and intrinsic
compression. He presented [**2144-9-14**] for rigid and flexible
bronchoscopy, initially planned as a day/ambulatory procedure.
Flexible bronchoscope showed patent distal airways. A Stent was
placed at the [**Hospital1 **]. Balloon dilatation perfomed with-in the stent.
Patency of distal airways confirmed. Estimated blood loss was
minimal.
.
In [**Name (NI) 13042**], pt was hypoxemic after extubation to 88-91% on room air
(does not use oxygen at home). Blood pressure 89/70. He remained
well-appearing and mentating post-operatively and ambulating
with the RN around the [**Name (NI) 13042**]. Planned thoracentesis was performed
at [**Name (NI) 13042**] bedside, with 2.2L drained from the right pleural space
with subjective improvement in symptoms. Post-procedure CXR
without pneumothorax. Given his vital signs, the patient was
planned for admission overnight with telemetry and continuous
pulse oximetry observation. He was placed on 10L non-rebreather
initially for desaturations into the low 80s and then
transitioned to 4L shovel mask, gradually to 4L nasal cannula
with neb treatments and mucinex.
.
Pt received IVF  without improvement in his blood pressures. His
blood pressures improved with attempted A-line, peripheral
placements to peak SBP100. While awaiting MICU bed, the patient
had labs drawn (within normal limits, WBC 6.7 --> 10), blood
cultures sent, received Vancomycin/Cefepime. In discussions with
IP, second CXR while in [**Name (NI) 13042**] suggestive of RML/RLL collapse
after procedures with planned flex bronch by IP in the morning.
.
He was admitted from the [**Name (NI) 13042**] to the MICU due to concerns about
his respiratory status.  He was taken back to the OR for another
rigid/flex bronch.  Attempt was made to reposition the stent
more proximally, which did not improve RML/RLL aeration and
obstructed the RUL, so stent was removed.  LMA
removal/extubation occurred right away, but bipap was initially
required upon transfer to ICU after this procedure.  A pigtail
was also placed  for continued drainage of R sided effusion.
Oxygen has been weaned down to nasal cannula, BP remained stable
and t transferred to th eOncology floor on [**2144-9-17**].On th
eoncology floor  pt reports he feels quite well, feels breathing
significantly improved.  No chest pain, nausea/abdominal pain.
Has had occasional cough with yellow sputum, no blood.  Stable
weight, no edema, no orthopnea.
All other ten point ROS was negative.

Past Medical History:
obesity, hypertension, CAD s/p CABG, hyperlipidemia, anemia,
polyclonal gammopathy, osteoarthritis, hypogonadism, renal
insufficiency, BPH, allergic rhinitis, skin cancer, and ischemic
optic neuropathy, L orbital pseudotumor s/p biopsy.  s/p wedge
resection of RLL as above.
.
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:
-- In [**12/2141**], he was seen in the ophthalmology clinic for
worsening right eye blindness and headache.
-- In [**2-/2142**] CTA revealed complete occlusion of the right ICA
and patent ACOM, and moderate stenosis of the right vertebral
artery.
-- In early [**2143**], he was reevaluated for persistent headaches
and progressive visual loss.  Imaging revealed a retroorbital
lesion. On MRI and MRA imaging studies NSMC:  An ill-defined
mass in the right posterior orbit encasing the optic nerve
extending into the right cavernous sinus with thrombosis of the
RCA inside the cavernous sinus.
-- On [**2143-5-28**], he was seen by neurosurgery for evaluation.
-- On [**2143-5-24**], given the concern for lymphoma, a CT of chest,
abdomen, and pelvis was performed to assess for other lesions.
This revealed a 1 cm right lower [**Year (4 digits) 3630**] pulmonary nodule with
irregular margin concerning for primary lung cancer or
metastatic disease.  Otherwise, on imaging was found no evidence
of lymphoma, a 6-mm bladder diverticulum.
-- On [**2143-6-12**], PET CT scan revealed 24 x 22 mm right
retroorbital soft tissue mass which is FDG avid (SUV maximum 5)
with FDG avid retrobulbar fat.  In the right lower [**Last Name (LF) 3630**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] FDG
avid 14-mm solitary nodule (SUV maximum 7.1) otherwise no
evidence of distant FDG avid disease.
-- On [**2143-7-30**], biopsy of the orbital apex lesion showed a
mixed inflammatory picture, it was not diagnostic lymphoma.
-- On [**2143-11-5**], PET CT noted a 2.2 cm right lower [**Year (4 digits) 3630**] nodule
with a SUV maximum 8.24 with no FDG avid mediastinal, hilar, or
axillary lymphadenopathy.  Again noted was the FDG avid right
retroorbital soft tissue density.
-- On [**2144-2-14**], he underwent a right lower [**Year (4 digits) 3630**] wedge
resection, which revealed squamous cell carcinoma (2.5 x 2 x 1.5
cm) grade 2 moderately differentiated T2a N0 Mx tumor which was
invading the visceral pleura and had lymphovascular invasion.
Level 7 and 9 lymph nodes were negative for malignancy.
A few days prior to his six-month followup visit, he noticed
being increasingly short of breath.
-- On [**2144-8-18**], CT of the chest revealed new right-sided
effusions and new 3-mm nodules in the left upper and lower
lobes, suspicious.
-- On [**2144-8-20**], 2 liters of pleural fluid were drained from
his right lung, which was negative for malignant cells.
-- On [**2144-8-31**], PET CT revealed stable retroorbital soft
tissue fullness.  A 3.4 cm right lower [**Year (4 digits) 3630**] FDG avid nodule
(maximum SUV is 30), FDG avid lymph nodes in the right perihilar
region measuring largest 2.5 x 1.4 x 5 cm maximum SUV 30
associated with marked narrowing of the bronchus intermedius,
obstruction of the lower [**Year (4 digits) 3630**] bronchus with distal patency, and
marked narrowing of the origin of the middle [**Year (4 digits) 3630**] bronchus.
There were 2 FDG avid pleural soft tissue masses on the right
measuring 2.8 x 3.2 cm (maximum SUV 36) and another nodule
measuring 3.9 x 4.2 cm (maximum SUV 19) along with pleural
posterior to the right costophrenic angle highly suspicious for
metastatic deposits.  In addition to right pleural effusion,
there is bronchovascular thickening in the right lower [**Year (4 digits) 3630**]
suspicious for lymphangitic spread of disease.  The three
nodules which are seen in the previous study remain unchanged.
There are postoperative changes
consistent with right lung wedge resection.   There are two FDG
avid rib metastases, anterior fourth rib (maximum SUV 37) and
posterior eighth rib (maximum SUV 17) and a right sacral
metastasis (maximum SUV 26).
-- On [**2144-9-3**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed bronchoscopy.  Fine needle
aspirate of the right upper lope endobronchial mass and right
bronchus intermediate mass both revealed squamous cell
carcinoma, non-small-cell carcinoma.
