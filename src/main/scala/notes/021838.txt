Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the ICU.  She was given fluids and
developed shortness of breath.  She was diuresed with lasix and
her symptoms improved.  Gi consult evaluated the patient and
performed a colonoscopy. Colonoscopy showed large grade 3
internal hemorrhoids as the likely source of her bleed, also
polyps in the ascending colon that were not removed as they were
small and INR was 1.5.  Surgery was then consulted to determine
the method of controlling her bleeding.

At time of transfer to the floor, the patient had no new
complaints: no abdominal pain, chest pain, shortness of breath,
fever, chills or any other concerns.  Her last blood BM was the
previous day and her BM's on the day of transfer were normal.
She notes increased urination, most likely secondary to the
lasix.

The patient was stable on the floor with stable hematocrits in
the low 30's and no blood in her stool on subsequent BM's.  She
had no symptoms of her CHF such as shortness of breath or lower
extremity edema.

She was kept on her digoxin, morning and evening home lasix
doses and carvedilol.  Valsartan was restarted however the
patient became hypotensive and was then discontinued.

On CTA of the patient's abdomen the week prior to admission, the
liver showed some hepatic congestion most likely secondary to
her right heart failure.  The general surgeons were concerned
with this finding and requested a RUQ ultrasound to rule out
hepatic pathology.  The RUQ US only showed a questionable
septated fluid collection around the gallbladder which was found
to be ascites fluid on a repeat abdominal CT scan.

The general surgery team recommended outpatient follow up and
management of the hemorrhoids.
