Chief Complaint:
Xfer from MICU

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
n/a

History of Present Illness:
76F with cardiomyopathy [**1-8**] CAD (EF 20%, s/p CABG w/LIMA + SVG
to RCA) severe AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.5 and mean grad of 46) who initially
presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**11-17**] with 2-3 weeks of worsening
productive cough, SOB/DOE X 1 month. Felt to have bilateral PNA
(bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on CXR, no effusion) and was
treated with Ceftrix/Azithro and Solumedrol along with
nebulizers and lasix. During the admission, she developed chest
pressure and pulmonary edema with hypotension and hypoxia
requiring intubation.  Patient was noted to vomit during
intubation.
.
[**2026-11-17**] patient ruled in for MI w/CK37-->58, trop .5-->1.2.
.
Pt became hypotensive (SBP - 70s) and then placed on dopamine
gtt transition to levophed and vasopressin.
Hydrocort/fludrocort started for poor response to [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim.
Patient was given amiodarone for afib.  She has been diuresed in
the CCU recently, although remains net positive for length of
hospital stay.
.
She had fevers on HOD4.  She came in on ctx/azithro changed to
ctx/vanco w/fevers.  Now on zosyn d4 and vanco d5.  Through her
time in the CCU, her creatinine has ranged 1.3-->1.1-->1.6 and
her HCO3 has risen 22-->44.
.
[**Hospital 95702**] transfer to MICU requested  for primary problem being
pulmonary.

Brief Hospital Course:
.
[**11-19**]: Echo: [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 3841**] dilated, EF 20-30%, Aortic Valve
velocity: 4.3 m/sec, Aortic Valve area 0.5cm^2, Akinesis of the
anterior septum and anterior free wall and dyskinesis of the
apex, focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall of the right
ventricle, (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral
regurgitation jet is eccentric. Tricuspid gradient 30mmHg
(elevated).
.
[**11-28**] CT
1. Diffuse ground-glass opacity suggests the presence pulmonary
edema. More confluent areas of parenchymal opacity are
suggestive of superimposed aspiration or pneumonia within the
right upper lobe and left lower lobe.
2. Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions without evidence
of loculation.
3. Cholelithiasis.
.
A/P: 76W w/CAD, severe AS, cardiomyopathy with respiratory
failure likely [**1-8**] multifocal pna and pulmonary edema and
hypotension likely [**1-8**] combined cardiogenic and septic shock.
Patient appropriate for transfer to MICU; appreciate ongoing
input from cardiology regarding pt care.
.
Respiratory failure- Likely contributors include multifocal PNA
including VAP, pulmonarey edema [**1-8**] heart failure.  PaO2 / FIO2
is 217.5 but multifocal infiltrates have been actually
increasing with diuresis, raising ? of ARDS.  Patient has been
on heparin and ppx part of her hospital stay, but difficulty
w/oxygenation raises ? of PE.  ARF raises concern for CTA and
infiltrates would make VQ more difficult.  Will check LENIs,
D-Dimer for initial investigation.  While fungal infection
doubted, will check galactomanin, bglucan, fungal bcx.  By ideal
body weight, ideal tidal volume 312 by ARDSnet.  Will decrease
TV and use increased RR as needed to maintain MV.  Will increase
PEEP.  Will obtain repeat sputum cultures and will consider
bronch, thoracentesis.  As PCWP 28, will continue diuresis with
goal negative 1-2L today.  Will cont vanc/zosyn/cipro, nebs.
Will check vanco levels.  Will need trache/PEG given 2w
mechanical ventilation if to continue.  Will review vent records
and if appropriate, conduct 5/0 SBT.
.
Hypotension- At baseline, patient has poor EF and severe AS.  As
inpatient, patient had cardiac enzyme leak raising ? of acute
event and likely sepsis.  Will recheck cardiac enzymes, QD ECG,
tsh.  Will cont levophed and vasopressin as needed to maintain
MAP>60.  Will change sedation from propofol to
fentanyl/midazolam.
.
AFib-Cont amio.  Patient has DDD AV pacer adjusted today by EP.
.
CAD- Has likely had some recent ischemia.  Rechecking enzymes as
above.  Would ultimately benefit from cath once more stable.
.
Crit drop- Elevated coags raise concern for DIC.  Will recheck
crit now.  Will check smear, fibrinogen, hapto, fdp.  Will guaic
all stools.  Will perform NGT lavage to r/o UGIB.
.
[**Name (NI) 10271**] Etiology unclear.  Contributors may include sepsis,
diuresis, multiple meds.  Will check UA, UCx, Ulytes.  [**Month (only) 116**] check
RUS.  Will consult renal for assitance with ARF, metabolic
alkalosis.
.
FEN- Metabolic alkalosis may be [**1-8**] diuresis, ATN.  Checking
UA/lytes.  Diuresing as above.  Replete/deplete lytes PRN.
.
PPX- bowel reg, PPI, sq heparin
.
Code Status- Full Code per discussion by CCU team with husband
who is health care proxy.
.
Contact- [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 95703**]: Daughter: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 95704**] who husband agrees
will be point person for conducting information.  Family meeting
5PM today to discuss status, prognosis, plan, goals of care.
.
Dispo- MICU

One hour after above plan, patient had VFib arrest.  Had periods
PEA during code.  Code attempts unsuccesful X 40m.  Code run by
CCU resident.
