Brief Hospital Course:
42 y/o F s/p being hit in head by boyfriend 48 hours ago
presents to OSH with new onset seizure activity. Patient was
intubated and sedate. Head CT revealed a 7mm R frontal acute SDH
with no midline shift and a small nondisplaced parietal skull
fracture. Patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
neurosurgical evaluation. Patient arrived sedated and intubated.
She was purposeful on the R and w/d on the L side, PERRL. She
was then admitted to the ICU and SW was consulted for domestic
violence. Once in the ICU, neurology was consulted for seizures
and EEG lead were place for monitoring. No seizure activity was
seen on EEG. On [**2-9**], patient was extubated. On exam, she was
intact. She has a history of EOTH abuse, she was placed on a
CIWA scale and monitored closely. On [**2-10**], patient remained
intact. She was transferred to the SDU. The evening of [**2-10**] she
attempted to leave AMA but was convinced to stay. On the morning
of [**2-11**] her exam was nonfocal and she again wished to leave AMA.
She was evaluated by the psychology team to determine competence
to make her own medical decisions and they felt that she was
medically competent. She was also evaluated by OT who felt she
required no services. Radiology noted a possible RML PNA and as
such she was placed on a course of PO levaquin.  Despite
conversations with the patient regarding her medical needs she
expressed intentions to be discharged against medical advice.
She was instructed explicitly to not drink alcohol as well as
this could react poorly with her current clinical status and
medication regimen. Ultimately she agreed to stay overnight on
[**2-11**] into [**2-12**] with hopes she would be afebrile. Overnight into
[**2-12**] she  was febrile to 102.1 and she again expressed her
intentions to leave against medical advice. Patient left on [**2-12**]
