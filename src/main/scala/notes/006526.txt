Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Hemodialysis

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 4281**] is a 69 year old man who was transferred from rehab
(there after recent hospitalization for CHF at NWH) due to
hyperkalemia and abdominal discomfort.  The patient has
apparently not had a bowel movement for over 1 week, and was
also found to have potassium of 6.8 (per records receiving
Kayexelate intermittently since [**4-11**]).  In the ED, the patient
was found to have a prolonged QRS of 236, with a sinusoidal
pattern.  He received insulin, D50, bicarb, and calcium in the
ED. There was also concern for digoxin toxicity, so digibind was
given, and his dig level returned at 1.1.  His QRS improved to
176.  Renal was consulted and the initial plan was for dialysis,
but he had a foley placed and 800 cc of urine drained, so it was
decided that diuresis would be attempted first.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2133-4-16**] 2:23 PM
CHEST AP: There is stable cardiomegaly. The patient is status
post median sternotomy and CABG. Mediastinal and hilar contours
are stable. The lungs are clear. There is no evidence of
pneumothorax. No definite pleural effusions are seen. Osseous
and soft tissue structures are stable. Central line tip appears
to be in the region of the right brachiocephalic vein. It
appears kinked at the IJ entry site.
IMPRESSION: No pneumothorax. Right IJ CVL tip in the region of
the right brachiocephalic vein. The catheter appears kinked at
the IJ entry site.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 41702**] hyperkalemia was likely secondary to acute renal
failure of unclear etiology.  Renal failure was thought to be
prerenal in etiology, or possibly due to poor cardiac output
because of CHF.  His EKG was significant for a widened QRS with
RBBB morphology.  His widened QRS was likley secondary to
hyperkalemia.  He received bicarb, calcium chloride, insulin/d50
for reduction of his potassium, but wide QRS complex remained on
his EKG.  The renal service was following, and hemodyalisis was
also performed on the night of admission.  He was monitored on
telemetry and serial EKG's were followed.  Throughout his
admission, he developed a worsening acidosis, rising lactate,
and coagulopathy.  On [**2133-4-18**], he became progressively
bradycardic and hypotensive.  Levophed was started, but could
not suppport his blood pressure.  The patient went into PEA
arrest and could not be resuscitated despite intervention.  He
died at 9:12am.
