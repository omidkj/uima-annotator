Pertinent Results:
ECHO [**2192-12-1**]: Conclusions:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional
left ventricular wall motion
is normal. 3. The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. Right ventricular
systolic function appears depressed. 4. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-5**]+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. 5. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-5**]+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.6. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. 7. Compared with the findings
of the prior study of [**2191-11-1**], LV function has
improved.
.
C-Scope: [**2191-6-3**]: Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum  .
.
CXR: [**2191-12-28**]:
INDICATION: History CAD, CHF, possibly new aspiration pneumonia,
Swan placement.

Comparison is made to the chest x-ray obtained one day prior.

FINDINGS: There is again present a Swan-Ganz catheter with the
tip terminating in the distal left pulmonary artery. An
endotracheal tube and an NG tube remains in stable position.
Median sternotomy wires are noted. The appearance of the lungs
are not significantly changed with persistent bilateral patchy
opacities predominantly in the mid and lower lung zones. There
are also persistent small bilateral pleural effusions.
.
CXR [**2192-1-6**]: HISTORY: Aspiration pneumonia status post
extubation.

COMPARISON: [**2192-1-4**].

AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The patient has been extubated in the
interval. The right IJ line remains in unchanged position. The
NG tube has been removed.

The degree of pulmonary edema is unchanged. There is patchy
atelectasis at the bases, unchanged as well.

IMPRESSION: Patchy bibasilar atelectasis unchanged. Unchanged
pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
86 year old male with multiple medical problems, on coumadin for
atrial fibrillation, who initially presented with melanotic
stools in setting of supratherapudic INR. Patient suffered
repiratory failure from fluid overlaod and was transferred to
the ICU, was extubated and re-intubated, suffered aspiration
event, and ultimately made CMO. Patient expired 1 day after
being transferred to the floor. The following issues were
addressed during his hospital stay:

* Respiratory failure: Intubated for hypercarbic resp failure
[**1-5**] volume overload. Peak pressures elevated on vent so nebs
added to decrease airway resistance. PIPs and plat still
elevated likely [**1-5**] volume overload but improved following
diuresis. He was extubated on [**12-23**] but as above, reintubated on
[**12-26**] due to an episode of pulmonary edema/aspiration/mucous
plug/VAP. During his second course of intubation, he was treated
for his pneumonia and his secretions improved. He was also
restarted on his lasix drip to maximize his lung mechanics for
another try at extubation. At a family meeting following his
second intubation, it was decided that there would be no trach
and no reintubation once he was extubated. Successfully
extubated [**1-4**]. Had aspiration event, per family meeting,
decision for Comfort Measures Only, patient expired on on
morphine gtt due to respiratory distress.
.
* Pneumonia: During his first course of intubation, pt grew out
Klebsiella and MRSA in his sputum. However, given the lack of
fever, infiltrate or leukocytosis, he was not started on
antibiotics. After extubation, pt had worsening secretions that
he could not control. Once he was reintubated, his wbc rose and
he was noted to have a fever with possible new RML infiltrate.
he was therefore started on Vanc/Zosyn for a 10 day course of
aspiration vs vent-associated pneumonia. Given change in goals
of care, no further antibiotics were administered. Morphine gtt
administered for comfort care.
.
* Hypotension: Initially, hypotension, HR and urine output
responsive to fluids however became less so as MICU course
progressed. No evidence of sepsis. Swan on [**12-14**] shows elevated
CVP and wedge with low CO and elevated SVR indicating poor
forward flow [**1-5**] afib with RVR. [**Last Name (un) **] stim normal response.
Started on amio drip on [**12-14**] with no response in HR (still
~120s) and MAPs stable in 70s. However, the following day, MAPs
dropped into the 50s-60s so pt was started on Levophed. Echo on
[**12-15**] showed a new decreased EF to 35% (>60% on [**2191-12-2**]) with
new wall motion abnormalities suggesting NSTEMI. Over the next
few days, heart rate came down with improved pressure on
levophed allowing the initiation of a lasix drip. When pt was
reintubated on [**12-26**], his BP dropped again suggesting that his
hypotension is related to positive pressure and sedation. Swan
numbers did not indicate any signs of sepsis. Lasix drip was
started on and off for diuresis, was off all drips given change
in care.
.
* CHF: As above, pt with new depressed EF on recent echo.
Multiple valvular abnormalities including mod MR, mod AR, severe
TR, severe PR. Swan on [**12-14**] showed elevated CVP and wedge
indicating volume overload. Started on Lasix gtt on [**12-15**] with no
increase in urine output. Then started on nitro
