Hypotension

Subclavian Line

History of Present Illness:
68 yo M with history of fibromyalgia with chronic pain, MI s/p
RCA stent, HTN, COPD, and afib not on anticoagulation who was
transferred from [**Hospital 8641**] Hospital with hypotension. Pt was
admitted on [**7-15**] at [**Hospital 8641**] hospital for altered mental status.
His wife found him and thought that he was weak, confused,
acting strange. He was asking for people who were not there. He
fell twice when he was at home, did not lose consciousness, but
appeared shakey. Per [**Location (un) 8641**] records, pt had no preceding
symptoms of CP, palpitations, nausea, unilateral weakness, bowel
or bladder incontinence, or loss of consciousness. Per his wife,
the shakiness in his legs and arms has been going on for a
couple of months. He was also having stomach pains for "a long
time" and has had a barium study before (3-4 years) that was
negative and thought that it was possible reflux. At the OSH, he
had an ECG showing sinus bradycardia, old inferior wall MI, and
2 trops negative. CT scan of head on [**2113-7-15**] showed 1cm low
density periventricular white matter change and 2 areas on the
right, suggestive of chronic ischemic changes. Serum tox was
negative for salicylates, tylenol, etoh. UA was benign, Labs
were notable for BUN 46, Cr 2.8, WBC 11.3 with normal diff, and
Hct 33.9 with plts 302.

Given altered mental status, pt had LP which showed CSF RBC 274,
WBC 8, and he was started on Acyclovir for possible HSV
encephalitis. Prelim gram stain negative, and cultures prelim
NGTD (LP done [**7-16**]). Neurology was consulted given altered mental
status and concern for seizure, and recommended and MRI. The MRI
on [**2113-7-16**] showed chronic changes without IC abnormalities;
additionally, there was no signal abnls in temporal lobes to
support viral encephalities. There was decreased attenuation in
periventricular white matter, suggestive of chronic vessel
ischemia. He had a c-spine MRI as well that showed degenerative
changes, but no signal abnormalities. On [**7-17**], he was found to
have a rigid body, concerning for serotonin syndrome. His
Cymbalta had been held 24hrs prior to this. After this episode,
he appeared confused and minimally responsive, and therefore,
seizure thought to be a possible etiology. Neurology recommended
loading with fosphenytoin and starting dilantin. He was
intubated and transferred to the ICU given apnea and inability
to protect his airway. He was placed on AC Tv 500, RR 15, PEEP
5, FiO2 40%.

ID consult on [**7-17**], rec possible HSV encephalitis and to continue
Acyclovir while awaiting HSV PCR. However, per their note,
suspected non-infectious etiology.

He was discharged with possible diagnoses including
nonconvulsive status epilepticus, probable serotonin syndrome,
on acyclovir for possible herpes encephalitis (HSV PCR from CSF
pending), Metabolic acidosis with resp compensation, ARF,
rhabdomyolysis, microcytic anemia, Afib.

Per his wife, she was concerned because he "seemed to get worse"
every day. She reports that he was seeing things, including
people, "a committee of ten people."

Regarding his previous history, per his wife, his previous
doctors had [**Name5 (PTitle) 19301**] suspecting Lyme disease in him for some time
now. She says that given his muscle aches, feeling tired, they
suspected Lyme could be playing a role as well. He in fact had a
rash a few years ago at [**Hospital3 **] and nothing was ever found.
