Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo F with h/o dementia, CAD, diastolic CHF (EF 55%), severe
AS, chronic afib, transferred from OSH with R hip fracture and
possible C2 fracture for operative management of hip. She was
stable on the floor on her initial arrival.  Given her CHF and
AS, she was a high risk surgical candidate, but the family
decided to go ahead with the operation.  Postoperatively she was
in the MICU briefly for hypotension but was extubated without
difficulty, weaned off pressors after rehydration and
transferred back to the floor.  Perioperatively, she developed a
UTI and a LIJ clot, which were both treated.  Postoperatively,
she also developed delirium, and was less verbal than she was
previously.  She failed a speech and swallow evaluation, but the
medical team was optomistic that she would improve.  In the
meantime, multiple attempts at NGT placement were unsuccessful.

While on the floor, [**3-14**]-30, patient showed signs of
inability to clear her secretions.  On [**3-15**], she had an episode
of hypoxia.  CXR at that time revealed fluid overload, and she
seemed to improve with lasix.  Overnight that night, 1/2 blood
culture bottles were positive for S.aureus and Vancomycin was
started.  [**3-16**], she continued to do poorly, and again was
hypoxic.  CXR this time revealed dry lungs, but likely
aspiriation PNA or LUL.  Despite aggressive suctioning and
broadening of antibiotic coverage, Mrs. [**Known lastname 65362**] continued to
deteriorate and ultimately died approx 4:25 PM on [**3-16**].
