Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2736**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain and shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac cath ([**2170-2-20**])


History of Present Illness:
In brief, this patient is a 66-year-old male with past medical
history of DMII, hypertension, hyperlipidema, significant CAD
s/p CABGx2 most recently in [**2165**] who presented to [**Hospital 5279**]
Hospital with complaints of significant chest pressure and
dyspnea.  The day of presentation he was extremely short of
breath and complained of [**6-15**] nonradiating chest pressure over
his left chest wall associated with nausea and dyspnea. In the
ED, he was noted to be in severe respiratory distress and was
found to have acute CHF as well as ST depression on his EKG and
required CPAP and an ICU course briefly with low dose dopamine
for support. He was diagnosed with NSTEMI given elevated cardiac
biomarkers (trop I 1.45). He also required a nitro and lasix gtt
initially. Cardiac cath revealed complex anatomy and three
vessel native CAD with subtotal occlusion SVG-Diag. He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for evaluation by cardiac surgery and
interventional cardiology. He underwent c. cath at [**Hospital1 18**] and is
s/p DES in the SVG to Diagonal.

On the floor, he denies any complaints or concerns.

Final Report
REASON: Preop for CABG.

FINDINGS: Duplex evaluation was performed of both carotid
arteries. The left carotid artery is occluded. On the right,
velocities are 103, 94, 22 in the ICA, CCA, ECA respectively.
This is consistent with no stenosis.

On the left, velocities are 63, 93 in the CCA, ECA respectively.
There is
antegrade flow in both vertebral arteries.

IMPRESSION: On the right, there is no evidence of stenosis. In
the internal carotid artery on the left appears to be a chronic
ICA occlusion. Clinical correlation is warranted.




Brief Hospital Course:
66-year-old male with past medical history of DMII,
hypertension, hyperlipidema, significant CAD s/p CABGx2 most
recently in [**2165**] who presented to [**Hospital 5279**] Hospital with NSTEMI,
underwent c. cath showing severe three vessel disease and
complex coronary anatomy and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation. Cardiac surgery deferred CABG with intervetional
cardiology performing c. cath, s/p DES in the SVG to Diagonal.

# NSTEMI with severe native CAD s/p PTCA
Patient presented to [**Hospital 5279**] Hospital with 1-week history of
progressive dyspnea and [**6-15**] non-radiating chest left chest
pressure with nausea. On presentation, he was found to be in
pulmonary edema with hospital course complicated by hypotension
and NIPPV. See [**Hospital 5279**] Hospital records for hospital course and
cardiac cath report. His Troponin I peaked at 1.45 with no
CK-MB. EKG showed ST depression (unknown leads) with the
impression of NSTEMI. He underwent c. cath showing complex
anatomy and three vessel native CAD with subtotal occlusion of
SVG-Diag. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation by
cardiac surgery and interventional cardiology in setting of
complex coronary anatomy. It was deemed for him to undergo
cardiac cath with subsequent DES to SVG-Diag with no apparent
complications. An ECHO was performed at [**Hospital 5279**] Hospital with
report requested but not sent at time of discharge.

He was started on plavix for at least 1 year and should remain
on ASA indefinitely. Given his history of myalgias with
atorvastatin therapy but the desire for stronger lipid lowering
therapy after his recent event, pravastatin 80 mg was changed to
crestor 20 mg. He should be monitored carefully.

Physical therapy evaluated the patient before discharge, and
given the intense nature of his work in the dietary department
at a nursing home, it was recommended for him to remain out of
work for 4-6 weeks. He should be cleared for return to work by
his cardiologist.

 .
# Hypertension
He was continued on amlodipine, lisinopril.
.
# Chronic systolic heart failure (last EF 35 %)
The patient had pulmonary edema and fluid overload at [**Hospital 5279**]
Hospital and was diuresed with a lasix infusion. On arrival to
[**Hospital1 18**], he appeared euvolemic and at his dry weight of 162 lbs.
He did not complain of dyspnea on exertion. He had no oxygen
requirement. He was continued on beta blocker and ACE inhibitor
at discharge.
.
# Diabetes (last A1c 6.9)
He was continued on glucotrol 10 mg PO qAM and 5 mg qPM,
metformin
.
# Hyperlipidemia
He was discharged on crestor 20 mg PO qD.
