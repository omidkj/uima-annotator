Brief Hospital Course:
MICU course:

This is an 89 yo woman with mechanical fall found to be
orthostatic and anemic.

1. Ischemic esophagitis: Patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for
hematemesis that began while she was on the floor. She was seen
by GI right after arriving to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and underwent EGD which
showed evidence of ischemic esophagitis (see EGD report).
Patient was put on IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] and sucrafate QID, HOB elevated.
She required a total of 5u pRBC, and her hematocrit stabilized
for 2 days prior to transfer back to the floor. She had no more
episode of hematemesis since arriving to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], and was started
on clear liquids on [**10-21**]. Per GI, her diet was advanced to soft
on [**10-24**] and then to full on day of discharge. She tolerated this
without difficulty.  She should not receive any NSAID
medications. HCT prior to d/c was 33.

2. Fall: Sounds mechanical in nature but given profound
orthostasis in ED (asymptomic) this may possibly be
contributing. Also, given her subsequent hematemesis and
baseline anemia, bleeding likely contributing. Physical therapy
was re-consulted following transfer out of the ICU. Blood
pressures were stable on the floor but she will need further PT
rehab.

3. Orthostasis: unclear what degree related to anemia/bleeding,
dehydration, medication effect (amitriptyline, trazadone both
can cause orthostasis) or autonomic dysfunction. Trazodone was
discontinued and Amitriptyline was decreased to 50mg.

4. Anemia: Likely secondary to chronic GI bleeding. Pt has
refused colonoscopy in the recent past; family remains hesitant
to pursue further testing at this time. Hct remained stable
following transfer out of the ICU and was >34 on [**10-24**]. It is
recommended this be repeated in [**2-4**] weeks time.

5. Peripheral vascular disease: Aspirin was stopped in the
setting of her hematemesis; she was continued on pentoxifylline.

6. A TSH was sent while in the ICU.  It was elevated at 11.  It
is recommended this be repeat tested in [**2-4**] weeks at her PCPs
office.

7. Hypokalemia.  This was repleted several times and she was
discharged on daily KCL 10Meq.

Upper GI Bleed

Discharge Condition:
Improved


Discharge Instructions:
You were hospitalized for bleeding in the esophagus.  You were
found to have low blood pressure on admission to the hospital,
which undoubtedly caused you to have the fall at home, and which
led to changes in perfusion to the esophagus causing it to
bleed.  You were given a total of 5 units of red blood cells to
replace the blood you lost. You were found to have an elevated
TSH which may indicate you have an underactive thyroid gland.
Tests of this sort during hospitalization can be inaccurate, and
so I recommend that you have this test repeated within the next
1 to 2 weeks.  You should have your blood count and potassium
checked
