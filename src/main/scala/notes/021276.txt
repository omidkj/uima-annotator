Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 5893**]
Chief Complaint:
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation
Attempt at insertion of a central line
PICC line insertion

History of Present Illness:
79F COPD, CAD, lung CA, afib on coumadin, transferred initially
from [**Hospital1 **] with respiratory distress, failed intubation
attempt there c/b lacerated posterior pharynx. Then went to OSH
where she was finally intubated. Got lasix for presumed CHF, but
dropped pressures. CXR however did not show failure. OSH did not
have ICU beds, so transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
CBC remarkable for WBC 19 with 5 bands and foley drained frank
pus. Placed R fem line in ED for pressors and fluids, now on
levo. Applied gelfoam to post pharynx but still some oozing, as
INR is supratherapeutic. Getting CTA because of acute nature of
SOB. Started CTX/Zosyn/Azithro/flagyl for sepsis in rehab pt,
although no specific infiltrate convincing for pna.

Pertinent Results:
Echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with basal
infero-lateral hypokinesis. There is no ventricular septal
defect. The right ventricular cavity is dilated The aortic root
is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately
thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with minimal aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

MICROBIOLOGY:
Urine [**2109-3-26**]: resistant klebsiella, sensitive to meropenam and
zosyn
Sputum [**2109-3-30**] with stenotrophomonas

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 100616**] was admitted with urosepsis, which was determined
to be caused by a very resistant klebsiella, sensitive only to
zosyn and meropenam.  She required intubation and levophed in
the acute management of her septic shock.  Her extubation was
complicated by her co-morbid congestive heart failure, which
required a lasix drip to manage.  After extubation, she
sustained two episodes of demand ischemia secondary to the
hypotension resulting from her diuresis.  The hypotension and
high doses of lasix were also causing elevations in her
creatinine.  She failed a speech and swallow evaluation, and was
continuing to aspirate.  Palliative care was consulted about the
overall goals of care.  The family felt that she would not get a
good quality of life with tube feeds, which the only option for
her nutrition.  The patient was also expressing desires to
discontinue aggressive measures.  Her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was
brought into the discussion, and agreed that moving into comfort
measures only was the best option.
