History of Present Illness:
57 year old woman with known history significant for spinal
stenosis, IBS, and GERD who presents via [**Hospital 1263**] Hospital with 2
days of abdominal pain and vomiting. Initial diagnosis at [**Hospital 1263**]
hospital was pancreatitis with persistent tachycardia. She
reports nausea and dry heaves with upper abd pain since Saturday
night. No fevers, T 95.3 at home. On the day of admission, she
had a syncopal episode at home with LOC while going to the
bathroom, but denies head strike. Lowered to ground by her
husband. EMS was called; initially patient with SBP 50 and HR
130s. At [**Doctor Last Name 1263**], received 3L IVF and no significant improvement
in HRs. CT showed pancreatic edema and ascites on imaging; no
gallstones seen.

The patient was transferred to the medical ICU and later
transitioned to the medical floor.

Denies history of alcohol use aside from 0-1 drink each day
while on vacation over the past week and prior to that 2
drinks/month. No new medicines or supplements. No family hx of
pancreatitis.

Labs at OSH: WBC 16.4, Na 135, K 3.5, Ca 8.2, Cr 2.67, Amylase
1661, Lipase 758. Denies prior history of pancreatitis or
gallbladder conditions.

Past Medical History:
spinal stenosis
exercise induced asthma (no intubations)
hypertension
vaginal dryness
hepatitis A [**2060**]
ear surgery
appendectomy [**2074**]
c-section
tonsillectomy
GERD
IBS s/p recent c-scope, EGD reported per pt as "normal"
normal stress test w/in last 5 yrs for palpations


Social History:
- Tobacco: quit over 30 years ago
- Alcohol: reports less than 2 drinks / month, 0-1 drink /day x
5 days while on vacation
- Illicits: denies


Family History:
Denies pancreatic or hepatic conditions in her family.

Physical Exam:
Admission Exam to ICU:
Vitals: 98.7 126 156/58 19 97 RA
General: Alert, oriented, appears uncomfortable but NAD
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
Lungs: mild rales at bases B/L, nonlabored breathing
CV: regular rhythm, tachy, no M/R/G
Abdomen: soft, no shake tenderness, mild guarding, diffuse
tenderness to moderate palpation, no rebound tenderness,
GU: foley in place
Ext: warm, well perfused, no clubbing, cyanosis or edema


Pertinent Results:
CT report from OSH (oral contrast, no IV): no gallstones seen,
but GB distended and likely "sludge" no ductal dilitation,
"severe" pancreatitis, w/ extensive extrahepatic inflammation in
abdominal pelvic mesentary, moderate pancreatic ascites,
thickening of wall of descending colon.

RUQ US [**9-24**]
1. No evidence for gallstones or sludge in the gallbladder.
2. The common bile duct is mildly dilated to 8 mm, a region for
this such as choledocholithiasis is not identified on this scan;
however, cannot be
excluded as the distal portions of the common bile ducts are not
visualized.
Therefore, MRCP is recommended.
3. Moderate amount of ascites and small right pleural effusion.
.
CXR [**9-27**]
FINDINGS: There is improved aeration in the region of the right
mid/upper
lung described previously. There continue to be bilateral
pleural effusions, but these are somewhat smaller compared to
prior. There is volume loss at both bases. An underlying
infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded at the bases.
.
CT abdomen [**9-30**]-IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening acute pancreatitis, with areas of necrosis, as well
as
surrounding edema and fluid. There is no well formed fluid
collection on this study.
2. Reactive changes of the duodenum and left colon.
3. Large bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
4. Moderate amount of abdominal ascites.
.
[**9-30**] MRI abdomen-
IMPRESSION:
1. Heterogenous signal intensity of the pancreas consistent with
patient's
known pancreatitis. A small region of necrosis at the neck
cannot be excluded.
2. Peripancreatic fluid, some hemorrhagic or proteinaceous
fluid. Likely
early pseudocyst formation, however, no drainable collection
seen.
3. Moderate perihepatic ascites.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

.
KUB [**10-3**]-IMPRESSION: Dobhoff tube with tip projecting over the
proximal jejunum.  Bilateral pleural effusions.
.
CT abdomen [**10-8**]-IMPRESSION:
1. Evolving pancreatic pseudocyst formation.
2. Evidence of SMV thrombosis with accompanying mucosal edema of
the
ascending colon.
3. No evidence of hemorrhagic pancreatitis.
4. No evidence of pancreatic necrosis.
5. Improving right pleural effusion, stable left pleural
effusion
.
Head CT [**10-1**]-IMPRESSION:
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Small amount of
fluid and
mucosal thickening in the left side of sphenoid sinus- correlate
given the
symptoms.
.
Abd CT [**10-15**]
INDICATION: Severe pancreatitis, now with fevers and bacteremia.
Evaluate
for evidence of bleeding or further infection of pseudocyst to
explain
fever/bacteremia.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases to the
pelvic outlet
without intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformats
were obtained.

COMPARISON: CT of the abdomen and pelvis on [**2104-10-13**]
and [**10-7**], [**2104**].

FINDINGS:
CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Bilateral pleural effusions are again noted
and appear
enlarged from prior examination, particularly on the right side.
The
visualized portions of the heart are normal in size and there is
no
pericardial effusion.

The liver has a slightly nodular contour to the right lobe
without caudate
lobe enlargement. There also appears to be a partially
recanalized umbilical
vein that is visualized on prior examination. There are no focal
liver
lesions and the hepatic and portal veins are patent. The
gallbladder is again
noted to be edematous similar to a prior study on [**2104-10-13**].

On this non-contrast CT the pancreas is not high density and not
suggestive of
hemorrhage in the pancreatic parenchyma. A pancreatic pseudocyst
with likely
internal hemorrhage is again noted (2:45). Grossly the
pancreatic pseudocysts
appear similar in size and distribution. However an anterior
pancreatic
pseudocyst that measured 5.8 cm on prior examination appears
smaller on
today's examination, measuring approximately 4.9 cm (2:43). The
exact
delineation of these collections is unclear but they do not
appear to have
worsened. There is no gas noted in any of the pancreatic
pseudocysts to
suggest infection.

The stomach and small bowel appear are unremarkable. An NG tube
is noted
coursing into the fundus of the stomach. The ascending and
transverse colons
are edematous. There is more ascites than on prior study
tracking
perihepatically and into the left paracolic gutter. There is
more third
spacing into the subcutaneous fat throughout the mesentery and
into the
transverse mesocolon. The spleen, adrenal glands and kidneys are

unremarkable. There are no renal stones. There is no
intra-abdominal
lymphadenopathy. There is no free air.

CT OF THE PELVIS: The distal transverse, descending and sigmoid
colon and
rectum are all collapsed, unchanged. An unchanged amount of
pelvic free fluid
is again noted. The uterus and adnexa are unremarkable. A Foley
catheter is
noted in the bladder, which is unremarkable. There is no free
air.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic
lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1. Worsening bilateral pleural effusions particularly on the
right.
2. No overt worsening of pancreatic pseudocysts. The pancreatic
pseudocyst
in the region of the transverse mesocolon appears slightly
smaller. There is
no gas within the pseudocyst to suggest infection.
3. Increased amount of ascites.
4. Nodular contour to right lobe of the liver with a partially
recanalized
umbilical vein.
5. Ascending and transverse colon mucosal edema, likely
secondary to
pancreatitis.
6. Gallbladder
