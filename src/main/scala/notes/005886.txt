Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4765**]
Chief Complaint:
chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization complicated by perforation of the LAD


History of Present Illness:
Briefly, this is a 65 y/o F with hx of PMH of DM, HTN, HLP,
hypothyroidism and obesity referred by PCP to [**Hospital3 **] with chronic DOE and intermittent substernal CP without
radiation which would resolve with rest. Her symptoms had
steadily gotten worse however patient only recently brought this
to the attention of her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] EKG on ETT showed showed
downsloping ST segments in the lateral leads. Diagnostic cath at
[**Hospital3 **] showed complete blockage of LAD and OM and near
complete blockages of D1 and D2 and was transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for
Interventional Cath. She was assessed by the interventional
service, with preferrence for medical management during which
time C-[**Doctor First Name **] was consulted to determine if the patient was a
candidate for surgery. C-[**Doctor First Name **] did find her to be a surgical
candidate, however it was recommended by the transferring
physician that PCI be attempted per the original plan and the
patient went for cardiac catheterization. During her cath at
[**Hospital1 18**], there was an unsuccessful attempt to revascularize her
diffusely diseased LAD with CTO at mid (D2 take off). The
procedure was complicated by perforation of a small septal
branch treated with balloon inflation and resolved spontaneously
without sequela. A post perforation echo did not show any
pericardial effusion. Given her stability, several balloon
inflations (1.5 in the D2 and 2.0 mm in the prox-mid LAD were
performed. She did have subtle ST elevations noted during post
cath, and given this, and her intra-procedural complication, she
went to the CCU for observation overnight.
.
In the CCU she did have an episode of substernal CP post cath on
[**2142-2-23**], lasting minutes, which was relieved by SLNTG and
morphine, with very subtle ST elevations noted. Serial pulsuses
have ranged from [**6-14**]. Her simvastatin was increased to 80mg
daily, and atenolol 75mg daily, and her Ace inhibitor was held
given her recent dye loads.
.
On arrival to the floor her VS were stable.
Currently, patient denies CP or pain at either groin cath
siteDenies current CP, SOB, HA, lightheadedness of dizzines,
N/V/D or fever/chills. No myalgias or arthralgias.

Echo [**2142-2-23**]
Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal to hyperdynamic (LVEF>55%). There is
no pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
.
Echo [**2142-2-24**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased transaortic
velocity is likely related to high cardiac output. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2142-2-23**],
this is a more complete study with improved image quality. The
findings are similar

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 65 yo F with multiple cardiac risk factors
including Dm, HTN, HLP and strong fhx transferred fro MOSh after
cath there showing 100% blockage in LAD and OM and 80-90%
bloackages in D1 and D2. Transferred here for cath with
interventions vs. eval for CABG.
.
#. CAD: She was assessed by the interventional service and went
for interventional catheterization. This showed diffusely
diseased LAD with CTO at mid (D2 take off). The procedure was
complicated by perforation of a small septal branch treated with
balloon inflation and resolved spontaneously without sequela. A
post perforation echo did not show any pericardial effusion.
Given her stability, several balloon inflations (1.5 in the D2
and 2.0 mm in the prox-mid LAD were performed. She did have
subtle ST elevations noted during post cath, and given this, and
her intra-procedural complication, she went to the CCU for
observation overnight. In the CCU she did have an episode of
substernal CP post cath on [**2142-2-23**], lasting minutes, which was
relieved by SLNTG and morphine, with very subtle ST elevations
noted. Serial pulsuses were normal. Her simvastatin was
increased to 80mg daily, and atenolol 75mg daily, and her Ace
inhibitor was held given her two dye loads with her two
catherizations.  Her lisinopril was restarted on discharge given
its cardioprotective effects. It was recommended to the patient
that she establish a cardiologist given her cardiac problems.
.
# DM: Metformin was held inhouse, and restarted on discharge.
Her glucose levels were well controlled and glycemic control
should be maintained as an outpatient with titration of
medications by her PCP.
.
#. HTN: Her blood pressure was well controlled. Her atenolol
dose was increased, and her lisinopril was initially held given
her dye load, and restarted on discharge.
.
# HLP: Her statin was increased to a dose of 80mg daily.
