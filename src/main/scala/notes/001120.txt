Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Initiation of Milrinone

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right heart catheterization

History of Present Illness:
69 yo M history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with
moderately dilated left ventricle (last EF 10%) now with 4+ MR,
3+ TR and resultant pulmonary hypertension, NYHA class III heart
failure presenting for milrinone initiation.
.
Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 3536**] last clinic note dated [**2135-3-7**], the patient has
had progressive and marked reduction in his functional capacity
over the last few months. Over this period of time, the patient
has developed pulmonary hypertension. His most recent ECHO in
[**7-23**] demonstrated tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient of
50 mmHg indicating a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 60
mmHg to 70 mmHg. Currently, he is unable to walk more than a few
yeards or a few stairs without dyspnea. He also complains of
orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and occasional
lightheadedness. His symptoms were thought to be representative
of NYHA class III symptoms.
.
Weight in clinic on [**2135-3-7**] was 241 pounds, which is not far
from what has been considered in the past to be his dry weight.
.
It was felt that the patient was doing poorly at this time now
with orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and dyspnea during
ordinary activities of daily living. ECHO was performed in
clinic showing left ventricle is more dilated and there has been
a substantial further reduction of ejection fraction (LVEF 10
%). In addition his mitral regurgitation is markedly increased.
Lasix apparently made him lightheaded and it was discontinued
recently.

Pertinent Results:
[**2135-3-9**] ECHO
Left ventricular cavity size is moderately dilated. There is
severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 15-20 %).
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 15-20 %). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with normal free wall contractility. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
moderate ([**12-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-3-7**],
right ventricular function is more vigorous. The severity of
mitral and tricuspid regurgitation is reduced. Left ventricular
ejection fraction appears slightly improved and cavity size is
smaller.

[**2135-3-7**] ECHO
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 10 %). The estimated cardiac index is depressed
(<2.0L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The right
ventricular free wall thickness is normal. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. An eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of at
least moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due
to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may
be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). The left
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
severity of tricuspid regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen. The
end-diastolic pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased
suggesting pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2134-7-21**], the left ventricle is more dilated and there
has been a substantial further reduction of ejection fraction.
Mitral regurgitation is markedly increased.

Brief Hospital Course:
69 yo M history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with
moderately dilated left ventricle (last EF 10%) now with 4+ MR,
3+ TR and resultant pulmonary hypertension, NYHA class III heart
failure presenting for milrinone initiation. Started on
milrinone in cath lab with excellent response.
.
# Milrinone Initiation
He has had significantly worsening functional status and LVEF to
10% over the last few months. He underwent right heart cath,
showing elevated wedge and PA pressures. He was started on
milrinone during right heart catheterization, with impressive
response. Wedge and PA pressures both dropped by almost half.
Cardiac index doubled. Milrinone was decreased from
0.5mcg/kg/min to 0.375 mcg/kg/min due to ectopy. He was admitted
to the CCU to monitor infusion. He continued to have some ectopy
and tachycardia. Carvedilol was restarted at an increased dose
of 25mg [**Hospital1 **] (he was on Coreg 20mg daily at home). This helped to
control his heart rate and ectopy.  A repeat echo the following
