History of Present Illness:
Patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year old woman with a past medical history
significant for hypertension, coronary artery disease, COPD, CHF
who was discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**6-18**] for E.coli urosepsis
and potential aspiration pneumonia who was admitted from nursing
facility due to mental status changes. When discharged on [**6-18**] to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 1188**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], patient was scheduled to complete course
of ciprofloxacin through [**6-30**] and a ten day course of flagyl.
In the nursing facility today, she was noted to have mental
status changes, so was brought to the ED where she was found to
have fever to 100.6 and hypotension to systolic 80's.
Tachycardia to 140's with atrial fibrillation.
In the ED, she was afebrile at 98.6, BP 117/54, HR 144, RR28,
and oxygen saturation was 100% on a nonrebreather. She received
3 liters of normal saline. Cefepime 2gm and vancomycin 1gm were
started. Head CT was negative. Chest xray did not reveal any
overt pneumonia. White count was 16.7, with 76% neutrophils.
Urine analysis was remarkable for [**3-8**] white cells and a few
bacteria.

Past Medical History:
- CAD
- CHF (EF=25%): dilated cardiomyopathy with severe LV systolic
dysfunction and ejection fraction 25%, 2+ mitral regurgitation,
and 2+ tricuspid regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery
hypertension
- COPD
- Asthma
- Severe uncontrolled hypertension
- History of medication non-adherence (including heart failure
meds including ACEI, diuretics)

Patient's daughter w/history of "leg ulcers"

ornery.
HEENT: Mild conjunctival pallor. No scleral icterus. Slightly
dry mucous membranes.

murmurs, rubs, or [**Last Name (un) 549**].
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, with decreased breath
sounds in lower lung fields, bilaterally. No wheezes, crackles,
or rhonci appreciated.
ABD: Hypoactive bowel sounds in all four quadrants. Soft.
Nontender and nondistended. Foley cathter in place.
EXT: Upper extremities warm and well perfused with 2+ radial
pulses. Lower extremities cool with right tendon exposed on
posterior aspect. Granulation tissue. Ischemic toes on right
that are cool and black. Could not Doppler PT and DP on right.
Right popliteal pulse palpable. Left foot with dopplerable PT
and DP pulses, but exposed tendon on dosalmedial aspect on great
toe.. No lower extremity edema, bilaterally.

[**6-22**] EKG: Narrow complex supraventricular tachycardia, most
likely atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
Occasional premature ventricular complexes. Borderline voltage
criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy. Diffuse ST-T wave
abnormalities may be due to left ventricular hypertrophy but
cannot rule out myocardial ischemia. Compared to tracing of
[**2156-6-16**] supraventricular tachycardia is new. Clinical
correlation is suggested.

Radiology
[**6-22**] Head CT: No intracranial hemorrhage

[**6-22**] CXR: There is no significant change compared to the study
of one week earlier. Low lung volumes are again present. The
lungs are clear and pleural surfaces are smooth with no effusion
or pneumothorax. Mild cardiomegaly and prominent aortic
tortuosity (likely related to severe scoliosis) are unchanged.

[**6-23**] foot/knee/tib/fib plain films: There are soft tissue
ulceration along the medial aspect of the right distal tibia. No
soft tissue gas is seen in the soft tissues of the lower
extremity or about the knee. Extensive vascular calcifications
are seen, and there is a stent seen within the mid femoral
artery. There are no signs for acute fractures. There is no
joint effusion. There is overall demineralization. No signs of
osteomyelitis is seen in the distal tibia adjacent to the soft
tissue ulceration. The ankle mortise is preserved.
IMPRESSION:
1. No soft tissue gas identified to indicate necrotizing
fasciitis. There is a prominent ulcer along the medial aspect of
the right lower tibia. There are no signs for osteomyelitis.
2. No signs for acute bony injury.
3. Extensive vascular calcifications.

[**6-23**] CXR: Compared with [**2156-6-22**], there is an apparent patchy
opacity in the right upper lobe which appears too large to
represent superimposed costochondral junction and may represent
a new infiltrate.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] year old female with history of hypertension, CAD, PVD and
recent admit [**Date range (1) 1163**] w/ E. coli urosepsis and aspiration PNA
(discharged on cipro/Flagyl) who was admitted to the ICU [**6-22**]
with mental status change, hypotension, acute renal failure. She
was treated with cefepime and vanco. Given evidence of bilateral
foot ischemia/gangrene, vascular surgery was consulted, who
recommended heparin and surgery. ICU course also notable for new
AF with RVR and aspiration pneumonia . The patient declined any
surgery, central line treatment, phlebotomy, IV line placement,
and cardioversion, expressing a desire to pursue
comfort-oriented care. After extensive discussion with the
patient and her grand-daughter, all medications not specifically
geared to comfort (antibiotics, anti-hypertensives, etc.) were
discontinued and the patient was made comfort-care only. She is
being discharged to [**Hospital3 **] with hospice services.
