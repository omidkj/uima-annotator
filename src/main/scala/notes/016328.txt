Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

#Unresponsiveness/Respiratory failure
Patient was unresponsive with agonal breathing for unknown
period of time. Causes of this episode include cardiac,
infectious, and neurologic. Given previous hx of CAD and CABG
with ST elevations in EMS concerning for large MI. However, the
family was refusing cardiac catheterization so no intervention
done.  As patient was anisocoric upon presentation, along with
elevated WBC and lactate that resolved within 24, and given hx
of seizures, another hypothesis was that she had a seizure and
stroke (one precipated the other).  CT head was negative but
this could not full rule it out as it could be a small bleed or
ischemic event.  Fatal arrhythmia cannot be ruled out, though
patient has no history other than A Fib. Elevated WBC from
baseline with L shift, elevated lactate and possible infiltrate
on CXR indicate infectious etiology. Likely would be hospital
acquired infection as she is s/p hospitalization 3 days ago. The
patient was intubated upon arrival to the CCU and empiric
antibiotics, IV steroids were initated for broad coverage and
blood pressure support (family declined central lines and
pressors).  Mechanical ventilation parameters were good in the
morning and the patient was successfully extubated, although had
some difficulty with secretions and required face mask
ventilation.  After discussion with the family the patient was
transitioned to comfort measures only.  Morphine and lasix prn
were given for air hunger and shortness of breath.  Her other
medications were withdrawn except for Keppra for seizure
prophylaxis.  The patient expired on [**2141-7-7**].

# CORONARIES:
ST elevations with recoprocal depressions in EMS concerning for
STEMI. Patient has history of CAD, s/p 3V CABG in [**2123**]. As
mentioned above, no invasive intervention was performed as
family did not opt for intervention.  She was medically managed
with aspirin and statin.

#Pulmonary Infiltrate
The initial CXR was read as pulmonary edema.  We had initiated
broad spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin and Zosyn) initially as
patient was recently hospitalized and there was concern for
hospital acquired pneumonia.  The antibiotics were kept on for
some time as they were considered symptomatic relief.  When
patient transitioned to comfort care these medications were
withdrawn.

# PUMP- Chronic Diastolic CHF
Patient has history of heart failure with preserved ejection
fraction. While in house previous admission, heart failure was
consulted. Team felt she was not decmpensated and recommended
maintenace of torsemide dose and d/c spironolactone given
creatinine and mild hyperkalemia. Increase in ProBNP on this
admission to 16,000 from 8000 is concerning for acute fluid
overload.  Because her initial presentation was more concerning
for sepsis patient did not receive diuresis (except fo
palliative measures only) while in the ICU.

# RHYTHM: Atrial [**Name (NI) **] Pt was on coumadin at home.  This
was held while in house due to supratherapeutic INR.

#Parkinson's Diease
We continued home levodopa-carvidopa until CMO.

#Hypertension
We held BP meds as concern for sepsis

#?h/o Sz: no dx of seizure disorder per record; EEG [**2140-12-20**]
negative for sz but possibly with epileptogenic focus
-We continued keppra while in house.
