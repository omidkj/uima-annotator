Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
Fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 72M w/ pmh CHF, a-fib on warfarin, ckd baseline Cr
2.2, presenting with two days of fatigue. He reports waking
yesterday morning, and when he got out of bed he syncopized. He
is unsure how long he was unconscious for. He reports his wife
found him from the floor and called an ambulance. Prior to the
ambulance arriving his temperature was measured at home and
found to be 104. He was brought to [**Hospital **] hospital where he
was complaining of fatigue, poor appetite, and left sided
shoulder, and chest pain, worse with movement of his arm. He was
hypotensive with sbp in the 80's. he had a white count which was
20, and an abdominal US which showed intraabdominal fluid and
mildly thickened gallbladder. He was given 3L of NS, and started
on vancomycin and zosyn.
.
He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management, where his
vitals were: 97.8 100/45 70 99% 3L. He was given 2 more liters
of NS and decadron 10mg IV X1.
He was recently hospitalized from [**2129-1-19**] through [**2129-1-29**] for
treatment of acute renal failure, congestive heart failure,
hyponatremia, upper GI bleeding, and amiodarone induced
thyrotoxicosis. During this hospitalization, he was started on
theophylline for his heart failure, underwent cauterization for
his upper GI bleeding, and was started on prednisone and
methimazole for his amiodarone induced hyperthyroidism. He
reports feeling well since his discharge on [**1-29**]. However, he
reports visiting his endocrionologist on [**2-2**], during which his
theophylline and methimazole were stopped, and he reports his
symptoms began after these medications were discontinued.
.
On ROS, he reports chest congestion, and occasional vomiting
over the past month. He denied dysuria or diahrrea. He denied
shortness of breath, orthopnea, or PND.

Radiology:
[**2129-2-3**] CT ABD/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. Moderate ascites of unclear etiology, though liver disease
should be
considered in the setting of gynecomastia.
2. Small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.
3. Small metallic density in the proximal stomach is of unknown
etiology. Correlation is needed.
.
CXR [**2129-2-3**]
IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly without focal lung consolidation or
overt edema.

CT Head [**2129-2-3**] :
IMPRESSION:
1. No intracranial hemorrhage or fracture.
2. Small metal density in the subcutaneous soft tissues below
the right orbit of unclear etiology. Correlate with direct
visual inspection.

[**2129-2-4**] US ABD LIMIT, SINGLE OR
FINDINGS: Limited abdominal ultrasound. There is moderate
ascites in all four quadrants of the abdomen. However, the
patient has significantly elevated INR of 3.2 in the morning of
the study. Paracentesis was not performed.

TTE [**2129-2-8**]:
Conclusions
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The right atrium is
markedly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 70%). Tissue
Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. There is abnormal diastolic septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume
overload. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch
is mildly dilated. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. No vegetation/mass is seen on the
pulmonic valve. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2129-1-20**], right heart volume overload is increased.

TTE [**2129-2-17**]:

Conclusions
The left atrial volume is markedly increased (>32ml/m2). The
left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is markedly dilated.
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). There is no
ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. There is
abnormal septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated, hypokinetic right ventricle with moderate
to severe tricuspid regurgitation and moderate pulmonary
hypertension. No evidence of endocarditis (cannot exclude).
Severe biatrial enlargement.
