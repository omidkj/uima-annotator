HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. [**Known lastname 59980**] is a 64-year-old
woman who was in her usual state of health until about 1 week
prior to admission when she developed shortness of breath and
orthopnea.  She had substernal chest pain and presented to
[**Hospital6 6640**] on [**12-27**] in respiratory
distress.  Her heart rate was in the 130's and she had marked
JVD.  She was in congestive heart failure and had diffuse
inferolateral ST depressions.  She was intubated and admitted
to the ICU at [**Hospital3 **].  Her hematocrit was found to
be 22.9 and she was transfused with 2 units of packs cells.
The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**1-1**],
which revealed 50 percent ostial left main stenosis and LAD
with diffuse disease and diagonal with 90 percent stenosis,
circumflex with 70 percent proximal stenosis and distal
occlusion and an RCA with 70 percent stenosis.  An echo done
at that time showed her EF to be 20 to 25 percent with an
akinetic apex and global hypokinesis, mild to moderate MR and
mild TR with mild pulmonary hypertension.  She then had a
colonoscopy which was negative and she was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] for cardiac surgery.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient's past medical history is
significant for hypercholesterolemia, status post
cholecystectomy, status post exploratory laparotomy for small
bowel obstruction, history of diverticulitis and abdominal
abscess, history of cecal polyps and iron deficient anemia as
well as chronic diarrhea.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:  Include Lomotil, Imodium, Lactaid.

ALLERGIES:  The patient states an allergy to Cipro, which
causes a rash.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for CAD.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a long smoking history.  She
has recently cut back and she currently smokes one cigarette
a day.  Denies alcohol use.  Lives at home with husband.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam, in general, a white
woman in no acute distress.  Vital signs are stable.  HEENT:
anicteric, noninjected.  Pupils equally reactive to light.
Extraocular movements intact.  Oropharynx is benign with
positive dentures.  Neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy or
thyromegaly.  Carotids are 2 plus without bruits.  Lungs are
clear anteriorly.  Cardiovascular:  regular rate and rhythm
without murmurs or rubs.  Abdomen is soft, nontender,
nondistended with normoactive bowel sounds and no masses or
hepatosplenomegaly and a well healed surgical scar.
Extremities without clubbing, cyanosis or edema, 2 plus
pulses bilaterally without bruits.  Neuro is a nonfocal exam.

The patient is admitted to the surgical service and scheduled
for coronary artery bypass grafting.  On [**1-2**], the
patient was brought to the Operating Room for coronary artery
bypass grafting.  Please see the OR report for full details
and summary.  The patient had a CABG times four with a LIMA
to the diagonal, saphenous vein graft to the LAD, saphenous
vein graft to the OM and saphenous vein graft to the PDA.
Her bypass time was 72 minutes with a cross clamp time of 62
minutes.  She tolerated the operation well and was
transferred from the Operating Room to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of transfer the patient was
in a sinus rhythm at 89 beats per minute with a mean arterial
pressure of 65 and a CVP of 8.  She had propofol at 20
mcg/kg/minute, Neo-Synephrine at 0.5 mcg/kg/minute and
dobutamine at 5 mc/kg/minute.  It should be noted that an
intraoperative TE estimated the ejection fraction at 40
percent and showed only mild mitral regurgitation.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
Her anesthesia was reversed.  She was weaned from the
ventilator and successfully extubated.  On postoperative day
one, the patient remained hemodynamically stable, requiring
only Neo-Synephrine infusion to maintain an adequate blood
pressure.  The Neo-Synephrine infusion was weaned off during
the course of postoperative day one.  On postoperative day
two, the patient remained hemodynamically stable.  Her chest
tubes and central venous access were removed and she was
transferred to the floor for continuing postoperative care
and cardiac rehabilitation.  Over the next several days the
patient's activity level was increased with the assistance of
the nursing staff and the physical therapy staff.  She had an
uneventful hospital course and on postoperative day four it
was decided that the patient was stable and ready to be
discharged to home.

At the time of this dictation, the patient's physical exam is
as follows.  Temperature 98.4, heart rate 76 sinus rhythm,
blood pressure 94/50, respiratory rate 18, O2 sat 96 percent
on room air.  Weight preoperatively 56 kg, at discharge 59.9
kg.  LAB DATA:  White count 4.9, hematocrit 29.6, platelets
142, sodium 137, potassium 4.1, chloride 104, CO2 25, BUN 10,
creatinine 0.7, glucose 94.  NEURO:  Alert and oriented times
three, moves all extremities, follows commands, nonfocal
exam.  PULMONARY:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, without murmur.
Sternum is stable, incision with staples, no erythema or
drainage.  ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with
normal active bowel sounds.  EXTREMITIES:  Warm and well-
perfused with no edema.  Left open saphenous vein harvest
site with Steri-Strips open to air, clean and dry.  Right
endoscopic harvest site with Steri-Strips also open to air,
clean and dry with a large ecchymotic area of the upper
thigh.

The patient is to be discharged home with visiting nurses.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
   bypass grafting times four with a LIMA to the diagonal,
