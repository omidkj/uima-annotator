Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is an 83M with CAD s/p CABG, CHF (EF 30-40%) who
presented to his PCP's office today for pre-op evaluation for
eye surgery. The patient complained of having increased SOB over
the past week with symptoms of orthopnea, and insomnia, and
increased lower extremity edema. The patient reports taking his
lasix regularly, and not missing any doses. He also denies any
major changes to his diet or excessive salt load. Lower
extremity edema has been chronic and on-going. Baseline weight
is 190 and his weight has been up somewhat over the past week.
On arrival at the office, was found to be hypoxic to 85% on RA,
with bibasilar crackles and lower extremity edema. Other vitals
were HR- 60's BP - 126/52 RR- 20. An EKG showed afib @ a rate of
44, and he was sent to the ER for further workup.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were 96.8 65 153/62 22 100% on NRB. He
was given asa 325mg, nitroglycerin, and lasix 60mg IV with 300cc
urine output. EKG showed slow atrial fibrilation with a HR of
40-50's. Initially the patient's oxygenation status improved
with diuresis and oxygenation improved to the low 90's on 4-5L
NC. A CXR showed a substantially increased L sided pleural
effusion compared to a CXR from a month prior, and a stable R
sided pleural effusion. Awhile later, the patient was again
noted to become hypoxic on 4-5L NC with O2 sats falling to the
high 80's from the mid 90's, though on physical exam crackles
were less apparent. Patient was sent for CTA to evaluate for
possible PE. The CTA showed no evidence of PE, but did confirm
large bilateral pleural effusions, which appeared loculated on
the R, and with RLL/LLL atelectasis and collapse. The patient
was given Azithromycin and Ceftriaxone for a presumable
pneumonia and was then transferred to the ICU for further
monitoring given his hypoxia and requirement of a
non-rebreather.
.
On ROS, he denies: Fevers, chest pain, cough

URINE CULTURE (Final [**2193-6-28**]):    NO GROWTH.

ECG: [**6-27**]
Atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response. Leftward
axis, likely
left anterior fascicular block. Mild non-specific ST-T wave
abnormalities.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2193-1-1**] the rhythm is now
atrial
fibrillation. The other findings are similar.

CXR: [**6-27**]
IMPRESSION: Substantially increased left pleural effusion, now
moderate, with
a predominantly subpulmonic component. Unchanged smaller right
pleural
effusion.

CTA Chest: [**6-27**]
IMPRESSION:

No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection. Moderate
bilateral
pleural effusions, loculated, right more than left, and
associated with
bibasilar areas of atelectasis.

Extensive mediastinal lymph nodes might be reactive, but should
be followed in
three months for documentation of stability/regression.

TTE [**6-28**]
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is
moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF
= 30 %). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated with depressed free wall
contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral
regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2193-1-1**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is
further reduced.

CXR [**6-29**]
Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged as well as there is no
change in
bilateral pleural effusions. There is interval improvement in
volume
overload/pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax. The right
pleural
effusion loculations are redemonstrated.
