Attending:[**Last Name (un) 20147**]
Chief Complaint:
Weakness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
The patient states that for the past 3 days she has been feeling
weak. She has been unable to ambulate. Her PO intake has been
poor. She states that she has decreased urine output for the
past couple of days. Also complains of pain in her throat which
started yesterday.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T 96.8 HR 68 BP 152/90 RR 18 SpO2
96% RA. Initial labs were notable for a K of 7.2, as well as a
positive UA. The patient was given insulin and D50, kayexalate,
3 amps of bicarb in D5W. EKG showed peaked T-waves. Otherwise
the patient was treated for positive UA with ceftriaxone. Renal
was consulted to see patient and determined that patient would
benefit from dialysis. Prior to coming to the floor received
calcium to stabilize cardiac membrane.
.
On the floor, the patient arrived with HR 66 BP 160/66 RR 18
SpO2 96% on RA.  Repeat labs on arrival to the floor initially
showed a K of 6.9 but on chem 10 was 5.9, repeat green top was
5.8.  Since her K was improving, it was decided not to pursue HD
for her hyperkalemia.  She currently feels well with no
complaints.

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 12528**] is an 84 year-old with history of CAD with
cardiomyopathy who presented with 3 days of weakness, poor PO
intake and was found to have hyperkalemia with peaked T-waves.
.
# Hyperkalemia: The patient recently was started on
spirnolactone which in conjunction with renal hypoperfusion
secondary to being volume depleted as well as taking an ACE
inhibitor could cause an elevated potassium. In the ED patient
received calcium gluconate, insulin with D50, kayexelate.  Renal
was consulted and recommended dialysis if her K did not improve
to less than 6 with medical management.  Spironolactone and
lisinopril were held.

Patient was admitted to the intensive care unit as she possibly
needed dialysis.  Her AM repeat potassium was <6 and she did not
require dialysis. She was treated with lasix for hyperkalemia.
.
# UTI: Urine analysis showed moderate bacteria, mod leuk
esterase, and 22 WBC. The patient has grown out urine cultures
several times before with sensitive E.coli as well as
entercoccus.  Patient was started on ceftriaxone IV.
.
# ARF: Likely pre-renal given recent medication addition of
spirnolactone. Could be over-diuresis resulting in renal
hypoperfusion.  Otherwise etiology could be also iatrogenic as
patient is on lisinopril, allopurinol although given the fact
the patient has been using this for some time now this is
unlikely.
.
# HTN: Patient recently was started on spirnolactone for high
blood pressure per the patient.  Lisinopril and spironolactone
were held in the setting of hyerkalemia.  Patient was given
lasix.  Continued atenolol.  Held isosorbide mononitrate as
patient getting high dose of lasix.
.
# CAD w/ cardiomyopathy: Patient has history of CAD.  Continued
home simvastatin and aspirin.  Held digoxin as patient had
elevated creatinine.
.
# Gout: Held allopurinol and colchicine given ARF while patient
in ICU.
.
On the medicine floor:
# Hyperkalemia: The patient may ahve been both dehydrated and on
spironolactone. The patient was also hyperglycemic which could
contribute to extracellular shift of potassium. The patient has
had good response in her K+ levels to initial treatment of
insulin, kayexelate, and bicarbonate. Renal does not feel that
dialysis is necessary. The patient's potassium had normalized by
early [**2117-4-15**], and remained within normal limits for the rest of
her hospitalization. Sprinololactone was discontinued, and
lisinopril held. The decision on lisinopril therapy is deferred
to her primary care physician.
.
# UTI: Urine analysis with moderate bacteria, moderate leukocyte
esterase, and leuko
