Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 4748**]
Chief Complaint:
R carotid stenosis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
R carotid endarterectomy with takeback for exploration and
angiography


History of Present Illness:
The patient is an 85-year-old diabetic female
who presents with a history of right internal carotid artery
stenosis found by her primary care doctor and had been
followed for some time. She presented for an MRA that was
done on [**2100-6-11**] which subsequently found that her
stenosis had progressed to 75-80% stenosis in the right
internal carotid artery. She is, of note, not having any
symptoms whatsoever from this such as transient ischemic
attacks or things like amaurosis fugax.  She therefore
presents today for definitive management of her asymptomatic
right internal carotid artery stenosis.


Past Medical History:
PVD, DM, HTN, CAD,hyperlipidemia, GERD, carotid disease and
stroke with gait imbalance. COPD


Social History:
Widowed, no EtOH, 25 pky smoking hx, quit [**2060**], no illicits.

Pertinent Results:
CTA-Post op
1. No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality. CTA
demonstrates moderate
left MCA M1 segment stenosis but patent anterior and posterior
circulation
vasculature. CT perfusion is within normal limits. If clinical
suspicion is
high for acute infarction, MRI is more sensitive for small
infarcts that may
be beyond the resolution of CT.

2. Expected post-surgical appearance of the right carotid
endarterectomy with
subcutaneous emphysema. Tiny filling defect in the proximal
right ICA may
represent a tiny mural thrombus.

3. Extensive diffuse atherosclerotic disease involving the
aortic arch and
bilateral carotid arteries. Moderate stenosis with calcified
atheroma at left
carotid bifurcation.

MRI

Right hemispheric infarcts, subacute. The distribution is
suspicious for
predominantly watershed infacts, with scattered smaller embolic
infarcts.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted [**2100-7-26**] for Right internal carotid artery
stenosis, symptomatic

R CEA

Post op - Left-sided neurological deficit, status post right
carotid endarterectomy

Exploration of the right neck and on-table carotid angiography.

An on-table carotid angiography was then performed, having noted
no obstruction or other abnormalities within the vasculature of
the common, external or internal carotid arteries.  We were,
therefore, satisfied with our examination that, indeed, there
was no acute occlusion of any of the arteries and, therefore,
proceeded to
ensure that the operative field was secured hemostatically

clipped and stripped. POD # !
