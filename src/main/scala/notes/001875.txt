History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness: Ms. [**Known lastname **] is 58 year old female with
history of COPD, Systolic CHF (EF 45-50%), Bipolar disease,
Borderline Personality Disorder, severe pain, depression, RA,
and oxygen use (4L without a clear-cut rationale).  She was
admitted today for chest pain and dyspnea.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] reports that she had the flu last week and began
experiencing diffuse chest pain (10+/10), a non-productive
cough, fatigue, and pain-associated dyspnea over the weekend
that differed in quality from her normal angina.  The pain
intensitifed when she would breath deeply or cough and she had a
reported fever of 102.0, and she denied chills/sweats as well as
any radiating pain to her neck or arms.  Ms. [**Known lastname **] did not take
her usual nitroglycerin, but instead called Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 575**], her pulmonologist who directed her to get a CXR at
the ED.  Medical records indicate that she described her chest
pain to EMT as left-sided, stabbing, associated with pressure
and dyspnea -- similiar to her normal angina-like symptoms.  Ms.
[**Known lastname **], however, disputes this characterization (along with
receiving any pain medications en-route or in the ED.
.
Ms. [**Known lastname **] also reports a worsening of her chronic diarhrea since
[**Last Name (LF) 2974**], [**1-19**].  She also reports that some blood in her
diarrhea since that time, but denies any change in her PO
intake, reporting that she had a proper dinner last night.
.
In the ED, Ms. [**Known lastname 3728**] vitals were BP: 115/63 & 102/53, HR: 107 &
90, RR: 16 & 20, O2 Sat: 100% 5L NC & 94% on 3L NC.  She was
also afebrile.  In the ED she received ASA (325 mg),
Nitroglycerin, Kcl (40mEq), Percocet (5/325), morphine (2mg IV),
and Levofloxacin (750mg).  She denied any abdominal pain and
refused a guaiac exam.  On physical exam, no wheezing.  A CXR
identified multifocal bilateral airspace opacities and blunting
of the left costophrenic angle -- consistent with multifocal
pneumonia and a small parapneumonic effusion.  Her EKG was
reassuring, and her cardiac enzymes (CK: 21) were negative. She
also had no events on telemetry and was reportedly chest pain
free before being transfered to [**Doctor Last Name **].
.
After being transferred to [**Doctor Last Name **], she complained of chest pain
and dyspnea, abdominal pain, and pain in the balls of her feet.
She also refused rectal guiac as well as an ABG.  A second CXR
indicated that her cardiac sillihette was stable, that she had
multifocal pneumonia with multifocal hazy opacities in her RUL,
RML, and LLL as well as a blunted left costrophrenic angle.

IMAGES:

STRESS ECHO ([**1-25**]) Poor functional exercise capacity. No ischemic
ECG changes with 2D echocardiographic evidence of possible prior

were normal before and after exercise.

CXR ([**2-28**]; am) FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest were
obtained. The cardiac silhouette is stable in appearance. There
is prominence of the right paratracheal stripe which is new
