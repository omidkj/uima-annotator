Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1990**]
Chief Complaint:
Back pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
NGT placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 10166**] is a [**Age over 90 **] y/oF with osteopenia, h/o multiple SBOs after
XRT for cervical cancer presented to the ED on [**2145-1-18**] for
acute exacerbation of back pain, and found to have a partial
SBO. Placement of NGT was complicated by aspiration event which
resulted in MICU admission.
Remainder of recent history per MICU note as copied below:
"Ms. [**Known lastname 10166**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with hypothyroidism, CAD s/p
MI, osteoporosis with h/o vertebral compression fractures, HTN,
h/o cervical ca s/p radiation complicated by radiation proctitis
and recurrent SBOs who presented with lower back pain. She
reports the back pain began on friday (four days prior to
admission) and was associated with nausea. Pain increased last
night. She denied numbness/tingling of legs, no motor weakness.
She denied urinary or stool incontinence. She denies trauma to
her back.
ED COURSE:
In the ED, vitals were T 98.5, BP 153/87, HR 72, RR 16, 94% on
RA. L spine film showed no acute fractures, but dilated bowel
loops were noted. She subsequently underwent CT abd which showed
SBO with a transition point. She was consulted by surgery who
recommended NGT, IVF, serial abdominal exams. She had emesis in
the ED of 500 cc of ?coffee ground versus feculent material. She
subsequently became hypoxic, satting 96% on 100%NRB. She was
given 2LNS in the ED. Additionally, she received 2 mg of
morphine IV for pain and 4mg of Zofran for nausea. GI was made
aware of the bleed. "

Pertinent Results:
[**1-18**] ct abd/pelv
1. Mild small-bowel dilatation with probable transition point
within the
right lower quadrant suggesting partial small-bowel obstruction.
Patient
would benefit from NG tube placement.
2. Small polypoid lesion along the posterior wall of the stomach
for which
further evaluation with fluoroscopy (upper GI) versus endoscopic
direct
visualization may be performed on a non-urgent basis.
3. Apparent progression of cystic focus in the region of the
head of the
pancreas since [**2141**]. Finding may represent a cystic neoplasm
versus IPMT and
further evaluation may be obtained with MRCP as clinically
indicated.
4. Mild improvement to chronic infectious/inflammatory process
within the
right lower lobe of the lung.
5. Small amount of simple appearing free pelvic fluid as before

[**1-18**] lateral spine
AP and lateral views of the lumbar spine show levoconvex
scoliosis and diffuse
osteopenia. There are compression fractures of the L1 and L2
vetebral bodies
unchanged from [**2144-4-24**] CT abdomen/pelvis. Probable
compression
deformity of T11 is indeterminate. Marked sclerosis of the right
pubic bone
may repreesnt the sequelae of remote trauma. Note is made of
multiple
distended loops of small bowel overlying the central abdomen
.
CXR [**1-18**]:
1. New right lower lung consolidations consistent with
aspiration/pneumonia.
2. Standard placement of NG tube.
3. Diffuse osteopenia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 10166**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female with hypothyroidism, HTN, CAD
s/p MI, osteoporosis, h/o cervical cancer s/p radiation therapy
with history of recurrent SBOs here with SBO and hypoxia
?secondary to aspiration.
.
# SBO. NGT was placed to suction per surgery and after 3 days
her SBO resolved, she was able to pass stools. Thought secondary
to her previous cervical cancer radiation therapy. Patient
tolerated diet and advanced to regular without recurrent nausea,
vomiting, or abdominal pain.
.
# Hypoxia: Recieved IVF which likely caused some pulmonary edema
in the setting of significant AS. Also felt to have aspirated in
the setting of NGT placement. Got hypoxic and was admitted to
ICU. Hypoxia improved with diuresis and CXR suggested pulmonary
edema vs. aspiration.  She was transferred to the floor and
weaned off of oxygen slowly. She had no fever or leukoyctosis to
suggest fever and she did not receive any antibiotics.
.
# Back pain: History of vertebral compression fractures and
osteoporosis.  There were no new fractures visualized on CT
scan.  Worsened pain thought to be most likely due to straining
in the setting of nausea and vomiting. Treated with standing
Tylenol, lidocaine patch, and Ultram prn.
.
# Hyponatremia. Known SIADH. Likely worsened secondary to pain
with possible dehydration component. Improved with IVF and
holding of hctz. Would not restart hctz given SIADH. Regular
diet. Fluid restriction.
.
# Hypothyroidism. H/o [**Doctor Last Name **] disease s/p iodine ablation.
Initially placed on IV synthroid while NPO then continued home
synthroid. Free T4 checked in the setting of AF/flutter and
normal.
.
# Afib/flutter: Noted on telemetry with HRs to 130s. ECGs
consistent with AF as well as atypical flutter at times. Pt was
asymptomatic, BP was stable. Uptit
