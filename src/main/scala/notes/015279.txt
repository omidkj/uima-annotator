Allergies:
Demerol / Iodine

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 15519**]
Chief Complaint:
Labile blood pressure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Arterial line placement [**8-29**]


History of Present Illness:
56F with h/o Stage IV Ovarian CA , recurrent DVTs, morbid
obesity and HTN who was sent to the ED from Oncologist's office
with Creatinine of 3.2 after five days out from an Abd CT with
IV contrast on [**2194-8-25**] to evaluate for peritoneal mets. She was
also taking increasing doses of MSContin for pain as her kidney
fxn was declining.  She has been mildly somnelent for few days
PTA with occasional nausea and headache. No fevers, chills,
diarrhea, hematuria, SOB. She does report decreased urine output
over the past several days.
.
In ED, she did not have accurate blood pressure measurements
secondary to her obesity and an inability to find an extra large
BP cuff. Systolic BPs were recorded from the 50s to the 160s,
though she had no clinical evidence of hypotension. Cardiology
was called for Echo which revealed no evidence of tamponade,
with nml EF. Pt received a total of 4L NS.  A left radial A line
was placed, she had persistent hypotension, with her blood
pressure supported with pressors and IVF in the MICU.  Of note,
she had a prompt response to Narcan, so it was thought her
change in mental status was [**3-19**] both contrast nephropathy and a
decreased ability to metabolize opioids while she was increasing
her dose at home.  Renal was consulted, and incr her renal
perfusion with pressors, IVF, lasix challenges.  As obstruction
was considered, a renal ultrasound on [**8-29**] demonstrated no evid
of hydronephrosis.  Her Creatinine continued to improve, and at
the time of her transfer to the floor, her Cr was 1.2, down from
6.6 on [**8-30**].
.
She was started on a heparin drip given her h/o UE DVT in the
right axillary and subclavian veins, previously managed with
lovenox.  A LE doppler on [**8-29**] demonstrated no DVTs.  It is
unclear why the pt was not on coumadin at home.  At transfer to
floor, she was changed from heparin drip to sq lovenox.
.
Heme-onc also followed the pt, she is s/p 5 cycles of
[**Doctor Last Name **]/taxol with resistant disease and will be switched to Doxil
per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15520**].  She has persistently low Hct/plt, which
heme/onc feels is a likely side effect of chemo.  She is
DNR/DNI.

Physical Exam:
PE: BP: AF 90's/70's P:67 RR: 14 Oxygen sat: 94%RA
GEN: Chronically ill. A&O X 3.
HEENT: Left eye down and out. Left ptosis. PERRL.
NECK: Swelling or right arm swelling. The right Port-A-Cath is
okay.
LUNGS: Show diminished breath sounds at the bases, left greater
than right.
CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, rub or gallop.
ABDOMEN: Obese with normal bowel sounds. Exam limited by body
habitus.
EXTREMITIES: Warm without rash.
Neuro: Non-focal other than left eye esotropia and ptosis. No
papilledema.  Normal gait.  Strength 5/5 upper and lower
extremities.  Sensation intact throughout.


Pertinent Results:
CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is interval decrease in
the left-sided pleural effusion with interval improved aeration
of the left lung. There is residual left-sided atelectasis.
Multiple calcified granuloma at the left lung base are again
demonstrated and unchanged. The airways appear patent to the
level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally. The heart,
pericardium, and great vessels are unremarkable.

CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Multiple intra-abdominal
fluid collections are again demonstrated and not significantly
changed in size or distribution compared to the prior study. The
appearance of a high density, thin, rim surrounding many of
these collections is again seen and unchanged. The liver,
spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, small bowel, and large
bowel are unremarkable. The pancreas is poorly visualized and
appears atrophic. An IVC filter is in place. Multiple
gastrohepatic ligament nodes measuring 11 and 12 mm in short
axis diameter are stable. No free air is seen.

CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The bladder, distal ureters,
rectum, and sigmoid colon are unremarkable. There is no pelvic
or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
CT Head: No obvious mass or midline shift or other evidence
increased ICP. (unofficial read).

CXR [**2194-9-3**]:  IMPRESSION: Resolving left lower lobe opacity
which may relate to resolving atelectasis or improving
pneumonia. Persistent small left pleural effusion.

ECHO [**2194-8-30**]: Conclusions:
Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal.  There is an anterior space
which most likely represents a fat pad, though a loculated
anterior pericardial effusion cannot be excluded. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 56F with h/o Stage IV Ovarian CA, recurrent DVTs, morbid
obesity and HTN with acute renal failure [**3-19**] contrast
nephropathy, and altered mental status [**3-19**] increasing opioid
doses in setting of failing kidneys (kidneys not able to clear
MSContin).
.
1. Acute renal failure, Contrast Nephropathy: Given temporal
relationship to contrast study, we felt this was most likely
contrast nephropathy. Her FENa was calculated to be 0.4% which
can be consistent with renovascular constriction from contrast
in the setting of DM.  Her renal ultrasound was without evidence
of obstruction.  We held her ACEI given ARF, and increased her
renal perfusion in the ICU with IVF, pressors and lasix
challenges.  Her Creatinine responded appropriately, and her
renal function demonstrated a downward trend in creatinine.  She
urinated well, with discharge Cr at 1.2 (her baseline).  Renal
was consulted and followed pt throughout her hospital course.
.
2. Cardiovascuar/Hypotension:
The etiology of her presenting hypotension was unclear, given
she had no active infection and this was not a septic picture.
She had +MRSA sputum with ?PNA.
Her echo on admission demonstrated EF=60%, but suboptimal [**3-19**]
anterior fat pad, so  tamponade could not initially be ruled
out.  She did not have a pulsus parodoxicus or elevated JVP.
.
3. Change in Mental Status secondary to uremia vs oversedation,
with decreased clearance of MSContin. Following admission to the
ICU, she developed worsening mental status, that responded well
to 0.4 mg Narcan. Of note, her MSContin dose recently increased
to 100 mg PO BID, so we felt that she had decreased clearance in
setting of ARF.  Her Head CT was wnl; and the pt was refusing
MRI (to look for carcinomatous meningitis).  She can follow up
as an outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15520**] regarding MRI for staging
workup of the brain.  At discharge, her mental status is  clear.

.
4. Pulmonary:  During her stay, she had a left pleural effusion
with left lower lobe opacification, suggesting atelectasis
versus consolidation on CXR.
