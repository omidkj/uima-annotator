Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76 year old male with history of bronchiectasis

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  76 year old male with history of bronchiectasis s/p R
lower lobectomy as a child, who presents with a few days of
increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, labs
notable for leukocytosis, intubated on arrival for respiratory
distress with markedly reduced air movement.
.
1) Respiratory distress:  Given this patient's history and
report of lack of air movement on exam on ED arrival, likely
exacerbation of bronchiectasis/COPD.  Admitted with high WBC, so
PNA considered given difficult to interpret CXR.  Patient
hypercarbic, with A-a gradient of 279 suggestive of PNA vs.
bronchiectasis as etiology.  ABG (7.30/60/359/31) consistent
with a mixed acute on chronic respiratory acidosis (more chronic
than acute).    Pt was covered with solumedrol and transitioned
to prednisone; started on Zosyn IV, nebs with transition to
Combivent inhaler with spacer.  Given Chest PT and acapella
device.  Sputum culture showed rare growth of gram negative rods
- identification pending.  2nd sputum culture pending at time of
d/c.  hemoptysis x 2 - none on day of d/c.  Received 3d Zosyn
and discharged on Levaquin for total of 14 day course.  Will f/u
with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] the week after d/c and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 575**] 1 week
after end of abx course and see outpt chest PT next week.
.
2) BPH: pt has long h/o BPH; upon admission, unable to urinate
and Foley could not be placed; urology put in SPT.  SPT capped
[**10-1**] and pt urinated well during admission.  Discharged with SPT
in place in case of emergency with plan to pull it upon f/u
urology appt the week after d/c.  Finasteride continued.  Flomax
started per urology; switched to Hytrin because of elevated BP
and was d/c with prescription.
.
3) Hypertension: pt's BP elevated during stay; h/o fluctuating
BP.  Per attending, was started on Hytrin for combination BPH
and BP control.  Day of discharge, BP ran anywhere from
120-165/80-92; appears related to pt's level of anxiety.
.
4) Rash: small, erythematous, vesicular rash on left lower
back/buttocks.  Presumed to be herpes simplex and pt given
prescription for acyclovir.
.
5) Leukocytosis:  Unclear if labs drawn after steroids, however
pt treated for possible infection; urine cx negative; sputum
culture pending.  Sent out on Levaquin.
.
6) EKG changes:  In setting of respiratory failure, cycled
enzymes - negative.
.
7) Tachycardia:  Likely related to respiratory
failure/intubation/stress/possible infection.  Monitored during
stay - resolved.  Monitor for now.  Hold on BB as sinus in
nature.  Address underlying/exacerbating problems.
.
8) Acute renal failure:  Creatinine 1.3 from baseline 0.9 on
admission; resolved after hydration.
.
9) PPx:  SQ heparin, protonix while vented.
.
10) FEN:  full diet.
.
11) Code:  full.  discussed with patient for prolonged period of
time; explained to pt that question will be asked each time he
is admitted to hospital.

12) Access:  Peripheral IVs, no need for central at the present
time.
.
13) Dispo:  stable, afebrile; home.
