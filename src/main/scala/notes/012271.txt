History of Present Illness:
This is an 83 year old female with a history of HTN, back pain,
and aortic insufficiency, presenting with SOB starting the night
prior to admission.  She has had cold symptoms with cough and
apparent chills for about one week; her daughter describes onset
of symptoms last Tuesday which improved Thursday/Friday.
Yesterday, she noted increased shortness of breath with
productive cough. Daughter denies any fever but endorses chills.
The patient was seen at [**Hospital **] Clinic earlier today and noted
to be in respiratory distress; she had new atrial fibrillation
on EKG. EMS was called to transport patient to the ED; she
received 325 mg ASA en route. Patient denied chest pain and
orthopnea in the emergency room.

Initial ED vitals T 98, HR 100, BP 134/60, 98% on 100% NRB. She
received 2 L NS and blood pressures remained 100-120 systolic
throughout her ED course. She received 1 SL NTG for chest pain.
Blood cultures were sent X 2 and she received levofloxacin 750
mg IV X 1 and ceftriaxone 1 g X 1. She was intubated with
etomidate & succinylcholine; she was then sedated on propofol.
FS was 256 which was treated with 6 U IV insulin. Oxygen
saturation on FiO2 100%, 5 PEEP down to 88%.

On arrival to the floor, the patient's initial blood pressures
were 80s/60s. A line was placed in right radial artery.

STUDIES:
=========
Admission CXR [**2190-3-8**]
Severe cardiomegaly and possibly generalized aortic ectasia have
worsened since [**2188-3-29**]. Moderate right pleural effusion is
present, and opacification in the right upper lobe is probably
pneumonia. There is some question of right hilar adenopathy.
Left lung is grossly clear, and there is no left pleural
effusion. The course of the nasogastric tube indicates that the
esophagus follows the meandering aorta, but the tube needs to be
advanced at least 10 cm to move all the side ports beyond the GE
junction. ET tube is in standard placement. Moderate generalized
distention of the gut is seen in the upper abdomen, no
pneumoperitoneum.
.
Discharge CXR [**2190-3-30**]
In comparison with the study of [**3-28**], there is again substantial
enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with relatively mild
elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, an appearance that
raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy or pericardial
effusion. The left hemidiaphragm and costophrenic angle are more
sharply seen; indistinctness of the right base is again noted.
.
ECG [**2190-3-8**]
Sinus rhythm. Atrial premature beats including a
four beat run of probable atrial tachycardia. Left ventricular
hypertrophy. Intraventricular conduction delay with left axis
deviation, probably left anterior fascicular block. Delayed R
wave progression could be due to left ventricular hypertrophy
and/or intraventricular conduction delay or possible prior
septal myocardial infarction, although baseline artifact makes
assessment difficult. Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities.
Clinical correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of
[**2188-4-20**] there may be no significant change but baseline artifact
on both tracings makes comparison difficult.
.
CTA [**2190-3-19**]
1. Stable interval appearance of a large retroperitoneal
hematoma as above. No evidence for active contrast extravasation
or thoracic-abdominal aortic aneurysmal rupture or leak.
Findings likely represent a spontaneous retroperitoneal
hematoma.
2. Endotracheal tube malpositioned within the right mainstem
bronchus. The tube requires urgent repositioning.
3. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and basilar atelectasis.
Nodular airspace opacification in the right upper lobe
reflecting aspiration or evolving infectious process.
4. Bilateral hyperdense renal cysts.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSEMENT/PLAN: 83 y/o F with known aortic insufficiency, HTN
admitted with multifocal pneumonia and respiratory failure,
retroperitoneal bleed, persistent respiratory failure, s/p trach
and PEG. At time of discharge, is off antibiotics for multifocal
pneumonia and being weaned off the ventilator. Her hematocrit
has remained stable.
.
# Respiratory failure: secondary to multifocal community
acquired pneumonia seen on CXR, intubated for respiratory
distress and maintained on mechanical ventilation. She was
treated with 8 day course of levofloxacin & ceftriaxone. No
organism grew out of any blood, urine or sputum cultures
obtained. Pt was extubated on [**3-14**] however reintubated several
hours later due to ongoing respiratory distress and stridor
despite nebulizer treatments and racemic epinephrine. s/p
tracheostomy on [**3-25**] and a PEG tube was also placed at the same
time for nutrition. She was diuresed daily to ensure success of
weaning of ventilator. Of note, vancomycin & zosyn had been
started empirically on [**2190-3-19**] in the setting of hypotension,
however were d/c'ed as cultures were negative and evidence of
blood loss as cause for hypotension was identified. Currently pt
on PS & PEEP, attempting to wean off however have been unable to
do spontaneous breathing trial so far. Pt is [**Name (NI) 25853**], PT
evaluation obtained.
.
# Systolic CHF/CMP: EF 40% on echocardiogram done 06/[**2188**]. Pt
was diuresed to decrease preload as well as improve respiratory
effort and encourge weaning off the ventilator. Diamox was given
to assist with diuresis given metabolic acidosis. Pt was started
on Captopril during admission and continued for afterload
reduction.
.
# Afib with RVR: Had episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR. Pt
was started on diltiazem 30mg po QID, currently increased to
60mg po QID, also pt on digoxin daily. The patient will
intermittently revert to atrial fibrillation, however is mostly
in sinus rhythm. Will need digoxin levels at regular intervals,
last digoxin level 1.0 on [**2190-3-26**].
.
# Hypertension: Initially BP medications had been held as pt was
hypotensive, however started captopril to assist with BP control
as we
