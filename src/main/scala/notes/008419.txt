History of Present Illness:
50 year old male with a strong family
history of heart disease reports symptoms of acid reflux dating
back twenty years. He describes his symptoms as a powerful knot
felt around the middle of the neck near the collarbone and
tightness in the upper epigastric area. He has not had these
symptoms in the past year. He also describes a decline in
activity tolerance compared to a year ago. A nuclear ETT dated
[**2127-11-6**] was positive for ST changes, frequent ectopy and an LVEF
of 30% with evidence of both infarct and ischemia. He was
referred for left heart catheterization. He was found to have
three vessel disease and is now being referred to cardiac
surgery
for revascularization.

Echocardiographic Measurements  [**2127-11-25**]
Results  Measurements  Normal Range
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness:  0.8 cm  0.6 - 1.1 cm

Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension:  *7.4 cm  <= 5.6 cm
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction:  25% to 30%  >= 55%

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.
RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal interatrial septum.
LEFT VENTRICLE: Severely depressed LVEF.
RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mild global RV free wall hypokinesis.
AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.
AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Trivial
MR.
TRICUSPID VALVE: Physiologic TR.
PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Physiologic (normal) PR.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions
Pre-CPB:
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 25 - 30 %). There is global HK, with akinesis of the
inferior wall.
The RV is mildly dilated and is mildly HK.
There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic
regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.

Post-CPB:
The patient is A-Paced, on no inotropes.
Biventricular systolic fxn is unchanged.
Aorta intact.


Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2127-11-25**] Mr.[**Known lastname 13130**] was taken to the operating room and
underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x4 (left internal
mammary artery ->Left anterior descending/saphenous vein
grafted->diagnal/Obtuse Marginal/posterior descending
artery)with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please see operative report for further
details. Cross clamp time=65 minutes. Cardiopulmonary bypass
time:79 minutes. He tolerated the procedure well and was
transferred to the CVICU intubated and sedated. He awoke
neurologically intact and weaned to extubation. All lines and
drains were discontinued per protocol. He was started on
beta-blocker/statin/aspirin and diuresis. On POD#1 he was
transferred to the step down unit for further monitoring. He was
started on a 7 day course of Indomethicin and Colchine for
pericarditis. Physical Therapy was consulted for evaluation of
strength and mobility. He continued to progress. The remainder
of his hospital course was essentially uneventful. On POD5 he
was discharged to home with VNA. All follow up appointments were
advised.
