HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 77-year-old male
with a history of congestive heart failure (ejection fraction
30%), coronary artery disease (status post myocardial
infarction times two), and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
since [**2113-6-26**] (not cardioverted to [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**]).  He
presented to the [**Hospital6 256**]
Emergency Department on [**2113-8-26**] complaining of
shortness of breath and dry cough for two days.  He also
noted one pillow orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.
He reported minimal pleuritic chest pain the night prior to
admission which he felt was due to coughing.  It was
different from the chest pain he had experienced with his
previous myocardial infarctions.  He denied nausea, vomiting
or diaphoresis.  He reported chills and possible fever the
night prior to admission.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation since at least [**2113-7-27**], not cardioverted due to [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 2966**] on anticoagulation.
2.  Congestive heart failure (transesophageal echocardiogram
on [**2113-6-26**] showed ejection fraction 30%).
3.  Coronary artery disease, status post myocardial
infarction times two, status post mid left anterior
descending stent, [**2113-1-27**], plus left circumflex/obtuse
marginal stent [**2111-6-27**].
4.  Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Gout.
7.  Iron deficiency anemia plus pernicious anemia.
8.  History of gastrointestinal bleed.
9.  Hypereosinophilic syndrome.

ALLERGIES:  The patient's allergies are aspirin, which causes
gastritis, and allopurinol causing rash.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife.  Denies
tobacco or alcohol use.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  His temperature was 100.4.
Heart rate 97 and irregular.  Blood pressure 111/79.
Respiratory rate 21, saturating 97% on five liters nasal
cannula.  General:  The patient is sitting up in bed and
appears to be in mild respiratory distress.  Head, eyes,
ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and reactive to
light, oropharynx clear.  Neck:  Supple, no lymphadenopathy.
Chest:  Crackles half way up from bases with diffuse
inspiratory and expiratory wheezes.  Cardiovascular exam:
Irregularly irregular, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Abdomen
was soft with normal active bowel sounds, minimal lower
abdominal tenderness.  No guarding.  Extremities:  2+ pitting
edema bilaterally, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses.  Skin:  No
rashes.  Neurological:  Nonfocal.

PERTINENT LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count
5.6, 76% polys, 8% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes and 10%
eosinophils.  Hematocrit 34.1, platelet count 164,000.  PT
18.8, PTT 36.9, INR 2.3.  Chem-7 was normal with the
exception of glucose at 184.  Urinalysis was negative.
Arterial blood gas was 7.48/32/88.  CK was 222, CK-MB 4,
troponin I less than 0.3.

Chest x-ray showed no evidence of pneumonia or congestive
heart failure.

Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at 95 beats per
minute, left axis deviation, old Q wave in III and aVF seen
on electrocardiogram from [**2113-7-5**].  No significant ST
or T wave changes.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:

1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient received 80 mg of Lasix
intravenously in the Emergency Department and subsequently
diuresed 3300 cc in three hours dropping his blood pressure
to 75/37.  There was also reportedly a change in his mental
status after this diuresis and his temperature spiked to 101.
He was given gentamicin 100 mg intravenously and vancomycin 1
gram intravenously for question of sepsis.  He received one
liter of normal saline boluses times three.  Blood cultures
and urine cultures were sent.  He was given diltiazem
intravenously times three in an attempt to control his heart
rate and was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
further management.

In the Medical Intensive Care Unit, he ruled out by enzymes
times three.  He remained in atrial fibrillation with rapid
ventricular response and was started on Metoprolol 12.5 mg.
He remained hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the
floor for further management.  His condition improved and he
continued to receive his home dose of Lasix of 20 mg po
b.i.d. with good response.  His Metoprolol was increased to
25 mg b.i.d. which kept his heart rate in the 80s to low
100s.  It was determined that he was not eligible for
cardioversion at this time due to inadequate anticoagulation
over the past four weeks, so, the goal was to diurese and to
obtain better rate control with his atrial fibrillation.
This was accomplished and he was discharged at his baseline
status, saturating 98% on room air with minimal crackles on
his lung exam and much improved lower extremity edema.

2.  Pulmonary:  The patient had some inspiratory and
expiratory wheezes on exam, but was not responsive to
Atrovent nebulizers, and was likely cardiac asthma that
improved as he diuresed.

3.  Anemia:  He has a history of chronic anemia.  He is on
iron and Vitamin B12.  Hematocrit was 34.1 on admission and
dropped to a nadir of 28, but stabilized out in the low 30s.

4.  Endocrine:  His diabetes was controlled with fingersticks
q.i.d. and a regular insulin sliding scale as an inpatient.
He was restarted on his Glucophage on discharge.

5.  Infectious Disease:  His blood cultures and urine
cultures were negative.  His antibiotics were not continued
and he did not spike any fevers for the rest of his hospital
course.

6.  Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  He was encouraged to
maintain a sodium restricted diet as dietary indiscretion was
partially responsible for this exacerbation.  He did not
require any electrolytes repletions during his stay.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  He was discharged to home in good
condition with Physical Therapy.
