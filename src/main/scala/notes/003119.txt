Chief Complaint:
left leg swelling

endotracheal intubation
bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 18654**] is an obese, otherwise healthy 52-year-old woman with
a history of psoriasis and "seasonal lower leg swelling"
referred from [**Hospital6 302**] for further evaluation of
filling defect withing the thoracic aorta at the arch and
extending into the descending aorta. She originally presented to
[**Hospital3 **] ED in early [**Month (only) **] with nausea, vomiting, and watery
diarrhea and mild left lower extremity pain and swelling in
early [**Month (only) **]. She was treated with antinausea and antidiarrheal
medications and instructed to use hot compresses for the lower
leg pain. The diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting resolved after
approximately 2 weeks, but the lower extremity pain worsened.
Approximately 1 week prior to admission, she reports that her
left lower extremity began "swelling up like a helium balloon"
and the pain in her calf and thigh worsened to the point where
she had difficulty walking. She returned to the [**Hospital3 **] ED on
[**2124-7-19**] (1 day prior to admission) with worsening left lower
extremity pain and swelling. Per surgery and heme/onc notes in
OMR, at [**Hospital3 17162**] she had elevated D-dimer but initial
ultrasound did not show a DVT. CT angiogram performed to
evaluate for pulmonary embolism showed a filling defect in the
aortic arch extending in to the descending aorta. No evidence of
pulmonary embolism. Per the patient, she was then referred to
[**Hospital1 **] Health for outpatient follow-up. [**Hospital1 **] Health referred
her to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and management by the
cardiac surgery service.
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2124-7-20**]. In ED, ultrasound was
negative for DVT, but chest CT (presumably from [**Hospital3 **], not
record in OMR) showed evidence of aspiration pneumonia and
antibiotics were given (no record). She was tranferred to
surgery. Cardiac and vascular surgery were consulted. She
underwent a lower extremity duplex ultrasound on [**2124-7-20**], which
showed an acute DVT with occlusive thrombus in the left femoral
and popliteal veins and a
nonocclusive thrombus seen in the left common femoral vein. No
DVT seen in the right leg. Chest MRI showed a filling defect in
transverse and proximal descending aorta in the same
distribution as seen on the CT scan. No visualized focal
dissection. Echo showed mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function. [**2124-7-20**] ECG
was read as normal sinus rhythm.
Rheumatology was consulted given concern for aortitis,
vasculitis. Per OMR, rheumatology stated no clear evidence for
systemic vasculitis or connective tissue disorder based on the
negative review of systems and exam. Recommended ESR, CRP,
anticardiolipin IgM and IgG, bet2 glycoprotein. Recommended
against lupus anticoagulant due to heparin gtt. Recommended
Heme/onc consult.
Heme/onc was consulted for hypercoaguable workup given the
finding of aortic arch thrombosis and given her recent history
of DVT. For the venous clot, did not recommend testing for
inherited
thrombophilias as it would not change the management of this
patient. Recommended anticoagulatoin for DVT for 3 months. For
the arterial clot, recommended testing for antiphospholipid
antibodies, testing for lupus anticoagulant once of heparin.
Also recommended all age- appropriate cancer screening if not
done
before (mammograms, colonoscopy).
Of note, Ms. [**Known lastname 18654**] reports previous seasonal experience with
lower extremity swelling (L>R), but denies any prior history of
DVT or PE. History is significant for remote miscarriage, no
further pregnancies. No recent surgeries, trauma. She was
relatively bed-bound for of ~2-3 weeks with
nausea/vomiting/diarrheain early [**Month (only) **].

Past Medical History:
 - LLE DVT (on coumadin)

Physical Exam:
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL: Patient is alert, pleasant, obese, no acute distress,
appears uncomfortable with movement
HEENT: Pupils equal, round, reactive to light. Extraocular
muscles intact. Sclerae anicteric. Conjunctivae pink.
Oropharynx clear.
NECK: Supple, nontender. No thyromegaly.
LYMPH NODES: No palpable cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary
lymphadenopathy.
CHEST: Left clear to auscultation. Expiratory wheezes in right
mid posterior lung field.
ABDOMEN: Obese, soft, nondistended, diffusely tender to deep
palpation. No hepatosplenomegaly appreciated (exam limited by
abdominal obesity).
EXTREMITIES: Bilateral lower extremity non-pitting edema. Left
worse than right. Left warmer than right. Left proximal lower
extremity warmer than distal lower extremity.
SKIN: Multiple erythematous lesions on all four extremities,
back consistent with psoriatic plaques.
NEUROLOGIC: Patient is alert and oriented to person, place,
time, purpose. Cranial nerves II-XII intact.

Imaging:
----CT-CHEST w/ CONTRAST
FINDINGS IMPRESSION:
1. Pulmonary embolism of the right main pulmonary artery - this
finding was
discussed with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at 16:13 on [**2124-7-28**].
2. Persisting nonocclusive descending aortic thrombus.
3. Prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, likely reactive in nature.
4. Rapid onset of diffuse ground-glass opacities with increased
consolidation of the right lower posterior lung and apical
segment of the left lower lobe; the differential diagnosis is
broad but includes edema/ARDS,infectious/inflammatory causes,
hemorrhage, or aspiration.

------DUPLEX VENOUS DOPPLER STUDY OF THE LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY
CLINICAL INDICATION: Patient with known left lower extremity DVT
and pain in left upper extremity.

The left internal jugular, axillary and brachial veins are fully
compressible as are the superficial basilic and cephalic veins.
Color flow and pulse Doppler assessment of all of the veins in
the left upper extremity is normal with no evidence of occlusive
or non-occlusive clot.

Procedures:
Bronchial lavage:
--NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.
