History of Present Illness:
58 year old male with a history of Type II DM, HTN,
hyperlipdiemia, and ischemic heart disease (EF 20%,
medicallymanaged)recently admitted with NYHA class III symptoms.
The patient was wintering in [**State 108**] and developed
chest pain and R/I for NSTEMI. Per the patient's report, he was
admitted to the ICU for observation given his presenting
asymptomatic SBP in the 70s mmHg; he did not require IABP or
assist device.  TTE showed severely depressed LVEF 15-20%,
consistent with admission TTE on [**2141-8-18**]. LHC was performed
during this admission, with mild progression of his CAD with LAD
80%,D1 95%, D2 70% OM1/OM2 70/90%, chronic total occlusion RCA.
The patient was counseled on ICD placement by his providers in
[**State 108**] but declined at that time. He had been medically managed
for systolic left heart failure with Diovan, Coreg, and Lasix
since that time.  He reports progressive DOE, weight gain, and
worsening LE edema over the past month. He denied chest pain,
orthopnea, PND, pre-syncope/syncope.  He presented to [**Hospital1 18**] with
LE edema and has been managed with diuretics, beta blockade, and
[**Last Name (un) **]. Since admission, the patient notes improvement in his LE
edema. Csurg was consulted for evaluation for CABG

Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2141-9-15**] 1:41 PM

Final Report CHEST RADIOGRAPH: INDICATION: Status post CABG.
COMPARISON: [**2141-9-13**].
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
relevant
change. The pre-existing right IG line has been removed. The
nasogastric
tube and the left PICC line are in unchanged position. The left
chest tube
has also been removed. Moderate cardiomegaly. No evidence of
pneumothorax.
No pulmonary edema. Presence of a minimal left pleural effusion
cannot be
excluded.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the
anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. No TEE related
complications. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.
Emergency study. Results were personally reviewed with the MD
caring for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data The
post-bypass study was performed while the patient was receiving
vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).
REGIONAL LEFT VENTRICULAR WALL MOTION:
     N = Normal, H = Hypokinetic, A = Akinetic, D = Dyskinetic
Conclusions
PREBYPASS:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Mild spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the left atrium and in the left
atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or [**Last Name (un) **].
The left atrial appendage emptying velocity is depressed
(<0.2m/s).
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There is septal
akinesis; the remaining left ventricular segments are
hypokinetic. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (LVEF= 20%).
RV with moderate global free wall hypokinesis.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
