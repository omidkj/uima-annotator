Fever, tachycardia

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63 year-old gentleman with recently
diagnosed anaplastic T-cell lymphoma status post 1 cycle of CVP
with radiographic improvement, also with a history of DM type 2
and CAD status post CABG in [**2129**] and recent NSTEMI, who presents
from rehab with fever. He was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**]
following a prolonged hospitalization during which the diagnosis
of anaplastic T-cell lymphoma was made in the setting of
clinical B symptoms and periportal lymphadenopathy, confirmed on
lymph node biopsy. His hospital course was further complicated
by a troponin leak consistent with probable NSTEMI with new WMA
on echo and systolic dysfunction. He had persistent fevers which
improved following chemotherapy, presumed secondary to lymphoma.
Other events of note included spontaneous bilateral
retroperitoneal bleeds (while on anticoagulation) with a
requirement for transfusional support (required about 17U PRBC).
He was discharged on [**2144-3-3**], and seen in follow-up on [**2144-3-10**]
with plan to pursue [**Hospital1 **] next week. A CT scan showed
radiographic response.
.
He now returns with fever and hypoxia at [**Hospital1 **] (88% RA,
T-102.5). Workup in the ED showed bilateral pna (was given
vanc/levo/flagyl), and he was febrile to as high as 103.9. In
this setting, he had a troponin leak to 1.04 (with no ischemic
EKG changes, no symptoms). Cardiology was consulted and felt
that this was likely demand in the setting of pna; they did not
recommend anticoagulation with heparin given recent RP bleed
(recommended ASA +/- Plavix). He was given some IVF (2.5 L), but
was intermittently tachycardic with fevers so was admitted to
the ICU for closer monitoring. SBP remained stable (90-100s)
throughout.
.
Currently, he denies any symptoms, stating that he feels fine.
Specifically, he has no dyspnea, no cough, no chest pain, no
palpitations, no dysuria, no hematuria, no nausea/vomiting, no
diarrhea

Past Medical History:
ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: As noted above, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
diagnosed with anaplastic large cell lymphoma in [**1-/2144**] after
he presented with B symptoms and periportal lymphadenopathy.
Immunophenotyping on a lymph node biopsy specimen was consistent
with anaplastic T-cell lymphoma. He is status post 1 cycle of
CVP with radiographic response, and awaiting probable initiation
of [**Hospital1 **] chemotherapy.
.

4. CHF: Systolic dysfunction, presumed ischemic cardiomyopathy
with EF 40-45% on last echo [**2144-2-21**], regional WMA. Persantine
MIBI in [**1-/2144**] with no ischemic EKG changes or anginal
symptoms, new mild fixed inferior perfusion defect.
5. Ulcerative colitis times 15 years. Last C-scope [**5-/2143**]
normal.
6. GERD
7. Status post Nissen fundoplication for hiatal hernia [**2136**].

RELEVANT IMAGING DATA:
[**2144-3-14**] CXR: Ill-defined bibasilar opacities are seen, more
severe on the left, suggestive of pneumonia. No large pleural
effusion. The mediastinum and hila are unremarkable. Mild stable
cardiomegaly.
.
[**2144-3-12**] CT [**Last Name (un) **] W/ CONTRAST: 1. Interval improvement in
abdominal and pelvic [**Doctor First Name **] consistent with response to treatment.
2. Persistent inflammatory infiltration of the RP fat
surrounding the pancreas and RP vascular structures. 3. Interval
increase in size of left pelvic retroperitoneal hematoma without
evidence of active bleeding. No significant change in bilateral
psoas hematomas. 4. Cholelithiasis.
5. Patchy atelectasis and minimal left pleural effusion at the
lung bases. 6. Fat containing left inguinal hernia.
.
[**2144-3-17**] CT CHEST/ABDOMEN/PELVIS:
1.  Study is limited for evaluation of potential abscess or
lymphadenopathy given lack of IV contrast administration.  That
said, there are no definite intra-abdominal abscesses
identified.  The bilateral retroperitonal hematomas have
slightly decreased in size since previous study.
2.  Diffuse bilateral patchy airspace opacity consistent with
pneumonia.
Bilateral small pleural effusions, more prominent on the left.
3.  No definite liver lesions ide
