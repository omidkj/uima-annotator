use--snorting and smoking.


Family History:
Sister died of pancreatic CA recently at age 56. Father died of
DM. Mother w/ unknown med hx. Daughter with bipolar disorder

Physical Exam:
On Discharge:
The patient is oriented x 3 but is very impulsive. PERRL and
EOMs intact. Face symmetric and tongue midline. He frequently
walks around the floor and is full strength with all 4
extremities. Sensation intact. Incision is healing well.

Imaging:
Head CT [**3-15**](post-op):
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There has been interval resection of the
expansile mass centered within the posterior ethmoid air cells
with associated surgical fractures of the ethmoid air cells.
There is mixed high-density material within this region that
could represent postoperative ethmoid hematoma. There is also
moderate-sized pneumocephalus. There is bifrontal craniotomy and
subsequent cranioplasty. A mesh is seen to project over the
frontal ethmoid recess and the frontal lobes. Due to artifact
from the postoperative mesh it is unclear as to what amount of
residual mass is present. Blood is also seen to extend into the
sphenoid and bilateral maxillary sinuses. There is gyral
effacement from the moderate-sized bifrontal pneumocephalus.
Otherwise, the ventricles and sulci are normal in size and
configuration. There are no acute major vascular territorial
infarcts and the [**Doctor Last Name 352**] and white matter differentiation is well
preserved. There is no significant midline shift. The
perimesencephalic and basilar cisterns are well preserved.
IMPRESSION: Post-surgical changes from resection of the
expansile lesion
centered in the posterior ethmoid air cells with associated
hematoma in the
paranasal air sinuses and ethmoid air cell surgical fractures.
Due to
artifacts from the frontoethmoid mesh it is unclear as to how
much residual
lesion is still present.

MRI Head [**3-17**]:
TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging was obtained
through the
brain prior to and following administration of contrast.
Diffusion-weighted
imaging was also reviewed.
FINDINGS:
As detailed on the recent CT, multiple postoperative changes are
noted
following a bifrontal craniotomy and subsequent cranioplasty. A
surgical mesh is unchanged in location projecting over the
frontoethmoidal recess. There is no evidence of residual
ethmoidal mucocele. Extensive paranasal sinus disease is
unchanged. Small foci of hypointensity on gradient echo
sequences are indicative of a small amount of intracranial
blood. There are no abnormal foci of enhancement. The remainder
of the brain parenchyma is unremarkable and the ventricles and
sulci are normal in size and configuration.
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post resection of ethmoidal mucocele with no evidence
of residual
mucocele.
2. Extensive unchanged paranasal sinus disease.

Head CT [**3-17**]:
FINDINGS: As on [**2102-3-15**], postoperative change including a
bifrontal
craniotomy and subsequent cranioplasty is again noted. A
surgical mesh
underlying the frontal lobes bilaterally, and overlying the
frontoethmoidal
recess is unchanged in location. A moderate amount of
pneumocephalus is
noted, decreased since [**2102-3-15**]. The brain parenchyma,
ventricles and
sulci are all unchanged in appearance, with no evidence of shift
of normally midline structures or herniation. Extensive
paranasal sinus opacification is unchanged. A moderate amount of
fluid is seen layering posteriorly in the nasopharynx. The
patient is intubated.
IMPRESSION: Postoperative change as detailed above, with slight
interval
resolution of pneumocephalus since [**3-15**]. There is no
evidence of brain
parenchymal herniation.

Head CT [**3-19**]:
Since prior exam, a right frontoparietal approach, EVD drain is
in place with its tip terminating along the inferior aspect of
the falx in the region of the third ventricle. Bifrontal
extraaxial hematoma adjacent to the central craniotomy site does
appear slightly increased in size from most recent examination.
No significant midline shift or mass effect is noted. Large
region of postoperative packing/hemorrhage in the expected
location of the ethmoid sinuses has likely been evacuated with a
more simple-appearing low- attenuation fluid within this region
identified. A small amount of hemorrhage may still persist
within the remaining anterior ethmoid air cells. Underlying mesh
is again noted and without significant change. There has been
interval increase in degree of pneumocephalus likely related to
recent procedure. Hyperdense secretions within the left sphenoid
sinus persist with opacification of the right sphenoid sinus and
scattered opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells appearing
stable. Complete opacification involving the maxillary sinuses
persists as well. Discrete degree of soft tissue swelling
especially along the orbital roof bilaterally appears slightly
increased from [**3-17**].
IMPRESSION:
No findings to suggest intracranial herniation. Status post new
right- sided EVD with interval increase in pneumocephalus due to
interval procedure.
