Sulfa (Sulfonamide Antibiotics)

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3531**]
Chief Complaint:
esophageal stenting c/b post procedure aspiration/hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD with esophageal stent

History of Present Illness:
86 year-old female with a history of esophageal ca who was
admitted from EGD suite after esophageal stent placement. The
patient last received radiation to her esophagus on [**2111-3-13**]. The
procedure was performed under MAC and complicated post-op by one
episode of desaturation to 89% and resp rate of 34 at the end of
the procedure. Patient was placed on O2 mask with 100% O2 and
saturationg increased to 98%. She was [**Last Name (un) 25177**] given an albuterol
neb. There was a question of possible aspiration during the
procedure. She was aggressively suctioned with mainly clear
secreations, but some "bilious" tinge per report. She was placed
on 6L NC. She became nauseous and vomited small amount bile and
given 4mg zofran IV. She remained in a-fib with HR in the 100's
post-op. BP 181/96 and 94% 10L O2, RR: 25 in the PACU. She was
transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring overnight.

ROS: The patient denies any fevers, chills, diarrhea,
constipation, melena, hematochezia, chest pain, orthopnea, PND,
lower extremity edema, cough, urinary frequency, urgency,
dysuria, lightheadedness, gait unsteadiness, focal weakness,
vision changes, headache, rash or skin changes.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2111-8-24**]: An esophageal stent extends from the level of the
carina to the upper stomach, pinched to about half its general
diameter at the level of the left atrium.  Mediastinum is
shifted to the left. Dense left perihilar consolidation could be
pneumonia, could also be radiation change, and mass. Heart is
moderately  enlarged whether due to cardiomegaly or pericardial
effusion is indeterminate.
Large irregular opacity obscuring the apex of the aortic knob
could be a
pleural or lung mass or just atelectasis. Small to moderate left
pleural
effusion is present. Any prior imaging of the chest should be
obtained for comparison purposes to determine the nature and
significance of the multiple findings described above.
.
CXR [**2111-8-25**]: Progression of the left lung consolidation with a
new left-sided pleural effusion. The appearences are again very
likely secondary to aspiration.
.
CXR [**2111-8-26**]: Interval worsening of left upper and left lower
lobe consolidation that might represent a combination of
aspiration and atelectasis. The heart size is unchanged. There
is no pneumothorax.
.
CXR [**2111-8-28**]: There is improvement in the left upper lobe
consolidation, with persistent left lower lobe consolidation and
a new left sided pleural effusion with left lower lobe and
lingular atelectasis. Mediastinal silhouette and esophageal
stent are unchanged.
.
CXR [**2111-8-28**]: No short interval change in appearance of the left
lung, with
findings likely representing a combination of consolidation and
atelectasis combined with a moderate left pleural effusion.
Considering presence of volume loss, CT may be considered to
exclude an obstructing process if warranted clinically. Cardiac
silhouette remains enlarged and mediastinum remains widened.
Esophageal stent is unchanged in appearance. Increasing
interstitial opacities in right lung likely reflect asymmetric
edema from fluid overload, and there is persistent right basilar
atelectasis and adjacent small effusion, unchanged.
.
CTA [**2111-8-28**]: 1. No pulmonary embolism.
2. Large bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right,
with associated atelectasis. Given cardiomegaly, these findings
may represent congestive heart failure.
3. Small amount of secretions within the right lower lobe
bronchus and
layering of material within the lower esophageal wall stent.
Aspiration is a diagnostic possiblity.
4. Enlarged pulmonary artery suggestive of pulmonary
hypertension.
5. Probably patent lower esophageal stent. However, please note,
stent patency or stenosis cannot be directly assessed on this
evaluation and a barium esophagram could be performed for
further assessment as clinically indicated.
.
ECG [**2111-8-25**]: Sinus rhythm with a single ventricular premature
beat. Low limb lead voltage. No previous tracing available for
comparison.
.
ECG [**2111-8-25**]: Sinus rhythm. Baseline artifact. Poor R wave
progression. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2111-8-25**] the
ventricular premature beat is absent and artifact is new.
.
CXR [**2111-9-1**]:
Large multiloculated left pleural effusion has changed in
distribution but not in overall severity. Left lower lobe is
still collapsed. Left upper lobe atelectasis has improved. Small
right pleural effusion is stable or slightly  increased.
Pulmonary vascular congestion persists, but I see no pulmonary
edema. Cardiac silhouette is obscured by adjacent pleural
abnormality but is probably large though unchanged. No
pneumothorax. Lower esophageal stent unchanged in position.
.
[**2111-9-2**] VIDEO SWALLOW:
IMPRESSION: Minimal penetration with thin consistency barium.
Otherwise,
normal oropharyngeal swallowing evaluation. Please refer to the
full notes by speech and swallow pathologist from the same date,
detailed in the treatment recommendations.
.
[**2111-9-3**] CT HEAD:
INDINGS: There are diffuse hypodense areas in the bilateral
frontal lobes
and periventricular regions likely representing small vessel
ischemic disease. There are no masses. There are no areas that
enhance inappropriately with contrast. There is no disturbance
of the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white delineation. There is no evidence of
hemorrhage or mass effect. The ventricles and sulci are mildly
prominent in nature, but appropriate for the patient's age. No
bony lesions are noted.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for metastatic disease.
2. Mild small vessel ischemic disease.
