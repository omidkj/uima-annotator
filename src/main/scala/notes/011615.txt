Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
Traumatic Brain Injury

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2108-5-18**]: Placement of a Right External Ventricular Drain
[**2108-5-22**]: Tracheostomy
[**2108-5-24**]: PEG
[**2108-6-23**]: Trach suture removal X2


History of Present Illness:
On [**2108-5-18**], the patient was on work site as construction worker
when a metal chain fell and hit him in the back of the head. He
was not wearing a helmet at that time. He had a GCS [**4-7**] on EMS
arrival. He was intubated on the field and med-flighted to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further care.
.
In the ED, CT head showed a depressed right occipital skull
fracture, adjacent parenchymal contusion and pneumocephalus,
Contrecoup hemorrhagic contusion and SAH in the left inferior
temporal lobe and sylvian fissure, focal parenchymal hemorrhage
in the midbrain (right cerebral peduncle). MR brain showed the
findings noted on CT, as well as small areas of hemorrhages at
the [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter junction, suggestive of diffuse axonal
injury. MR [**Name13 (STitle) 2853**] showed small disc protrusions at C5-6 and
C6-7 levels, with mo other findings of cervical spine trauma,
including no evidence of ligamentous disruption seen, spinal
cord compression or abnormal signal identified.
.
He was initially admitted to the trauma-SICU, where an external
ventricular drain was placed. No other neurosurgical
intervention was requird. The drain was removed on [**2108-5-28**]. On
[**2108-5-30**], the patient because febrile to 101.7. A catheter tip
culture from [**2108-5-27**] grew coagulase negative staph. The patient
was treated with IV vancomycin from [**2108-5-30**] to [**2108-6-13**]. A right
upper extremity PICC was placed on [**2108-6-1**].
.
The patient remained hospitalized on the neurosurgical flor due
to a disputed insurance claim related to a positive cocaine
screen from the emergency department.
.
On [**6-19**], the patient started to have fever, with cultures sent.
Then on [**6-20**], he developed bloody sputum and tachycardia. CXR
with atelectasis. Started on ceftriaxone/vancomycin for HCAP, as
well as IV fluids.
.
Just after midnight, on the morning of [**6-21**], the patient
triggered for tachycardia, diaphoresis, and desaturation to 91%
on 40% trach mask. CTA showed PE. Given need for anticoagulation
in setting of hemoptysis and patient's pulmonary status,
transferred to MICU to further management. Per neurosurgery, no
neurosurgical contraindication to anticoagulation at this time.
Recent neuro exam is fixed pupils, with right starting to become
reactive, minimal motor activity in 4 extremities with painful
stimuli. Neurosurg ordered IV heparin, but it had not been
started by the time that the patient arrived in the MICU.

Pertinent Results:
[**2108-5-18**] CT Head:
IMPRESSION: Depressed right occipital skull fracture, adjacent
parenchymal
contusion and pneumocephalus, Contrecoup hemorrhagic contusion
and SAH in the left inferior temporal lobe and sylvian fissure,
focal parenchymal hemorrhage in the midbrain (right cerebral
peduncle).

[**2108-5-18**] CT Cspine:
No fractures.

[**2108-5-18**] CT Torso:
CT CHEST: The thyroid gland is normal. No hilar, mediastinal,
supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy identified. Airways
are patent to the subsegmental level. Heart size is normal
without pericardial effusion. The great vessels are unremarkable
with no evidence of aortic dissection or intramural hematoma. No
pulmonary contusions or nodules identified. Trace bibasilar
opacities are noted in the dependent portions of both lungs and
likely represents atelectasis and/or apsiration. No pleural
effusions or pneumothorax identified.

CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS: The liver is normal in size with a focal area
of fatty
infiltration along the falciform ligament. The gallbladder,
pancreas, and
spleen are unremarkable. The bilateral adrenal glands have
normal limb
thickness without convex margin to suggest mass, hemorrhage, or
hematoma. The bilateral kidneys are normal in size and excrete
contrast symmetrically. The stomach and small and large bowel
demonstrate normal wall thickness without distention. The aorta,
inferior vena cava and portal vein and their major branches are
patent without evidence of injury. No retroperitoneal hematoma.
No retroperitoneal, mesenteric, or portacaval lymphadenopathy
identified. No mesenteric infiltration to suggest mesenteric
injury. The appendix is
visualized (2:106) and is normal. The rectum and sigmoid colon
are
unremarkable. No free fluid noted within the pelvis. The distal
ureters are unremarkable. The bladder is decompressed with a
Foley in place. No free fluid or lymphadenopathy identified
within the pelvis.

[**2108-5-18**] MRI BRAIN:
A right frontal ventricular drain is identified extending to the
right
lateral ventricle. There is a depressed fracture seen in the
right parietal occipital region with associated underlying
traumatic hemorrhagic contusion.  In addition, there are
multiple areas of hemorrhages identified within the brainstem
involving both sides of the mid brain right greater than left
side and also in the left temporal lobe. In addition, several
areas of small hemorrhages are identified with a [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white
matter junction at convexity as well as both thalami and both
posterior temporal regions indicative of diffuse axonal injury.
There is no ventriculomegaly seen. There is no midline shift.
There is no transtentorial or transforamen magnum herniation
seen.

IMPRESSION: Depressed fracture in the right parietal occipital
region with
associated underlying hemorrhagic brain contusion. Findings
indicative of
hemorrhage within the brainstem involving the mid brain as well
as
