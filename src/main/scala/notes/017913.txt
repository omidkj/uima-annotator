Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
rapid pulse

Lysis of pulmonary emboli with TPA
Intubation
Extubation


History of Present Illness:
(Per report, patient intubated)
Ms. [**Known lastname 656**] is an 88 yo F who is very active and in her usual
state of health until the morning of presentation.  She has a
history of vertigo and felt unwell this am.  She additionally
may have been slightly fatigued.  Given this, she remained in
bed most of the day.  When her daughter, who is a retired nurse,
visited her in the evening she took her pulse and found it to be
80.  Given this this is a rapid pulse for the patient, she was
brought to the ED.
.
In triage, initial ED VS were 97.6, 102, 122/87, 20.  Found to
be profoundly hypoxic.  Though not recorded in ED records,
patient was profoundly hypoxic and immediately placed on a NRB
without much improvement.  She was then intubated and continued
to have poor oxygenation on 100% FIO2, 10 PEEP with 90% O2Sat.
CXR did not reveal a clear source.  EKG with 90 bpm, SR, slight
LAD, rsR' V2.  CT head negative for acute bleeding.  CTA with
bilateral diffuse pulmonary emboli.  ABG on 80% FIO2 pH 7.40,
pCO2 42, pO2 61, HCO3 27.  She then suddenly had improved
oxygenation with ability to decrease her FIO2 to 70 and decrease
her PEEP.  Given improvement, decision was made to heparinize
rather the thrombolyse.
.
Upon arrival to MICU, patient is intubate, sedated and unable to
provide further history.
.
Unable to obtain ROS.

IMAGING: CTA, CT Pelvis, CT Abdomen:
1. extensive pulmonary emboli extending from the distal main
pulmonary
arteries into essentially every major branch to the subsegmental
level.
2. enhancing right renal mass measuring up to 2.3 cm, concerning
for
malignancy
3. splenomegaly
4. stable pancreatic ductal dilation up to 5mm, compared to
[**2140**].
.
CT Head
no acute intracranial process
.
TTE: The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. A right-to-left shunt across the
interatrial septum is seen at rest. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
unusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity is markedly
dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is
abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure overload. There is no mass/thrombus in the
right ventricle. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. At least
moderate pulmonary hypertension. Small, underfilled left
ventricle with normal systolic function. Patent foramen
ovale/small ASD with right-to-left shunting
.
MRI HEAD:IMPRESSION: Small areas of acute infarct in the left
parietooccipital region.
Mild-to-moderate brain atrophy and small vessel disease. No
evidence of
chronic microhemorrhages.

[**4-11**] repeat echo:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. A patent foramen ovale is present
with premature appearance of contrast after saline injection at
rest. . There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global
free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2146-4-8**],
the right ventricular cavity size is smaller and free wall
motion is improved. Premature appearance of saline is still seen
in the left heart, but the amount of saline contrast is reduced.

.
[**4-13**] MRI abdomen:
1. Study limited by respiratory motion artifact. No evidence of
enhancement of the 2.3 cm right renal lesion of concern on CT
[**2146-4-7**], which is compatible with a hemorrhagic cyst.
2. Other bilateral simple renal cysts measuring up to 6.4 cm.
3. Stable segmental dilatation of the main pancreatic duct,
unchanged going back to [**2141-7-20**]. No evidence of
obstructing pancreatic mass.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
5. Splenomegaly.
6. Moderate lumbar dextroscoliosis.
.
u/s [**4-8**]:
IMPRESSION: Partially occlusive thrombus of the left popliteal
vein.
