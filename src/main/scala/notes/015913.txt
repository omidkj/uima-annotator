Service:  [**Hospital1 **] Medicine

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 78 year old
female with a history of idiopathic tracheomalacia status
post tracheostomy on BiPAP at night who presents as transfer
from an another hospital on [**2158-3-17**] for tracheotomy and
stent placement.  The patient was initially admitted to an
outside hospital on [**2158-3-7**] with mental status
changes and in acute respiratory distress.  She had undergone
tracheostomy change on [**2158-3-7**].  Later that day at
approximately 10 PM she noticed increasing dyspnea,
particularly while lying flat with increased frothy and
blood-tinged secretions.  Reportedly she called emergency
medical services and then went to the hospital.  On arrival
to [**Hospital 44256**], the patient was found to be
minimally unresponsive with respiratory rate in the 30s.  She
ultimately progressed to hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
failure.  There an arterial blood gas showed values of 7.09/
carbon dioxide 118/oxygen 88 on 6 liters of nasal cannula
oxygen.  She was treated for a chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease exacerbation with Decadron, nebulizers, and
Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin.  She was also treated for
congestive heart failure exacerbation with Lasix and ACE
inhibitor.  Initially she required assist control mechanical
ventilation but it rapidly improved allowing weaning of her
oxygen back down to 30% tracheostomy collar mask during the
day and her normal BiPAP settings at night.  As the patient
has had progressive dyspnea on exertion, and frequent
hospitalizations for respiratory failure, plan was made to
transfer her for Y stent placement at [**Hospital6 649**] to prevent further tracheal collapse.  She was
admitted on [**2158-3-17**], to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit.  She stayed there over night.  She was transferred onto
a regular medicine floor on [**2158-3-19**].  Attempt at stent
was made on [**2158-3-20**].  Bronchoscopy at that time noted
severe right and left main stem tracheobronchomalacia greater
than 99% and 90% respectively, however, the procedure is
complicated by a left main stem endobronchial tear and
therefore aborted.  However, tracheostomy revision was
completed.  The patient was placed on CPAP pressure support
for ventilator support.  Post procedure imaging indicated
evidence of a pneumomediastinum.  Therefore she was started
on empiric antibiotics, namely Zosyn out of concern for her
mediastinitis.  She was therefore then transferred back to
the Medicine Intensive Care Unit for further monitoring.

Her Medicine Intensive Care Unit course was notable for some
extension of the pneumomediastinum, post procedure,
associated with chest pain, shortness of breath, agitation
and intermittent left lower lobe collapse.  She also
complained of chest pain and shortness of breath on [**2158-3-13**].  This was treated with metered dose inhalers, Morphine,
and Nitroglycerin.  The cardiac enzymes were cycled and the
patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction.  Since that
time she had remained hemodynamically stable with no evidence
of pneumopericardium, tamponade or infection.  Serial chest
x-rays demonstrated resolution of the pneumomediastinum.
Repeat bronchoscopy was performed on [**2158-3-27**] and
showed severe tracheobronchomalacia in both main stem
bronchi.  The left main stem tear appeared to have healed
completely.  The right side was notable for milky secretions.
Bronchoscopy was repeated on [**2158-3-28**] for therapeutic
aspiration of purulent right-sided secretions.  The patient
was able to be weaned back to her baseline daytime
tracheostomy collar setting with BiPAP at night.  Steroids
were weaned as well.  Nutritional goals were originally not
with tube feeds.  She did, however, pass a speech and swallow
evaluation on [**2158-3-28**] followed by video stroboscopy on
[**2158-3-29**] and was not able to tolerate a regular diet.
Of note, the stroboscopy showed right vocal cord paralysis
which she felt to be a complication of her longstanding
tracheobronchomalacia.  After completing a seven day course
of Zosyn as well, she was deemed stable for transfer out to
the floor pending stent provision.  The patient underwent
stent revision on [**2158-3-31**] with no immediate post
procedure complications.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Tracheobronchomalacia - This was felt
to be idiopathic in etiology versus related to the patient's
prior history of pesticide disorder.  She was transferred
here for a planned Y stent procedure.  Attempt was made at Y
stent on [**2158-3-20**], however, this was complicated by left
