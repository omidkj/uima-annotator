History of Present Illness:
82 year-old right-handed woman with a history of prior stroke
and dementia who presented with alteration in consciousness. The
history is per the primary team, the medical record, and the
pt's family. She had been in her usual state of health until
three days PTA. At that time, she was at home and experienced a
fall that was witnessed by one of her daughters.  [**Name (NI) **] daughter
is not sure if
the fall was mechanical or unprovoked.  She later said, however,
that after she fell, she was "shaking on the ground."
Specifically, she was not responsive and was seen to be
rhythmically shaking the arms and legs for roughly 5 minutes.
After this she was somewhat somnolent, but did not seem weak.
The next day, she complained of a headache. More significantly,
however, the pt's daughters noted that she became progressively
more somnolent and withdrawn. She seemed to stare ahead at
people and not respond appropriately. Her speech was
unintelligible.
She was not eating, drinking, or taking her medications. Her
daughters also noticed that the right side of her face seemed to
"droop."  As this persisted, her daughters took her to an OSH
for evaluation this morning.

At the OSH, she was described as "alert and nonverbal." She was
found to have a temperature of 99.6F and initial BP was
161/60mmHg. Labs were notable for an INR 2.5, and were otherwise
normal except for BUN of 29. She underwent CT of the head which
revealed small right subdural hematoma (8 to 9mm). She received
2
units of FFP, 5mg of sc vitamin K, and was loaded with 1g of
phenytoin. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for neurosurgical
evaluation. She was intubated on arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], and was given
2 units of proplex. Neurosurgery consultation was requested.

The pt was unable to offer a review of systems, however her
daughters noted that she had no recent complaints other than
headache for the past two days.

Past Medical History:
stroke, per daughters over 20 years ago.  At that time, she
presented with inability to speak; daughter cannot remember if
there was weakness as well. She was treated with warfarin at
that time, then restarted on the coumadin for unknown reasons
several years ago.
dementia: per daughters, at baseline she is able to recognize
her loved ones, feed herself, ambulate. She requires help with
washing and IADLs.
s/p pacemaker placement
hypertension
gout

Social History:
She lives at home with one of her daughters.  She has no history
of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. She is originally from
[**Country 3587**].

Family History:
Notable for mother with stroke.

Physical Exam:
On admission:
Vitals: T: 100.2F P: 63 R: 16 BP: 115/58
General: Lying in bed with eyes closed, intubated.
HEENT: NC/AT, no scleral icterus noted, MMM, no lesions noted in
oropharynx
Neck: No JVD or carotid bruits appreciated. No nuchal rigidity
Pulmonary: Lungs with transmitted upper airway sounds
bilaterally
Cardiac: difficult to auscultate over breath sounds, but
apparently RRR, and no murmur heard
Abdomen: soft, NT/ND, normoactive bowel sounds
Extremities: No C/C/E bilaterally, 1+ radial, DP pulses
bilaterally.
Skin: no rashes or lesions noted.

Neurologic:
mental status: Opens eyes transiently to noxious stimuli. Does
not follow commands.

cranial nerves:  PERRL 3.5 to 2.5mm. Funduscopic exam was
technically limited as pt resisted eye opening, but revealed no
papilledema, exudates, or hemorrhages. EOMI difficult to assess
secondary to forceful eye closure.  Corneal reflex and nasal
tickle present bilaterally. No overt facial asymmetry (but
difficult to tell given ETT in place). Gag reflex intact.

motor: Normal bulk throughout. Tone mildly increased in lower
extremities. Withdraws to noxious stimuli in all four
extremities. No adventitious movements noted. No myoclonus
noted.

sensory: Grimaces to noxious stimuli in all four extremities and
sternal rub.

Plantar response was extensor bilaterally.

[**11-5**]: CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: 1. Right subdural hematoma
in the temporal parietal region. No midline shift or significant
mass effect. 2. Encephalomalacic change in the left MCA
distribution, consistent with an area of prior infarction. 3.
Cavernous internal carotid artery calcification bilaterally.
There is asymmetric enlargement of the left ICA at this
location, suggesting aneurysmal dilatation.

[**11-8**]:  CT head without contrast: A cavum septum pellucidum et
vergae is present and is a normal variant. Again noted is
right-sided subdural hematoma extending along the right
convexity in the temporoparietal region which is unchanged in
size or character. There is unchanged effacement of the
surrounding sulci with associated mass effect. No intracranial
hemorrhage is identified. A large area of low attenuation within
the left posterior frontal and temporal lobes is visualized
reflecting encephalomalacic changes from prior infarction. There
is no shift in normally midline structures. Extensive
calcification of the carotid arteries in their cavernous course
is present. No abnormalities are noted within the osseous
structures or soft tissues.
IMPRESSION: This study is unchanged from previous. There is a
right subdural hematoma in the temporoparietal region with mild
effacement of the adjacent sulci and mild regional mass effect
without shift of normally midline structures. Encephalomalacic
change in the left middle cerebral artery distribution is
consistent with prior infarction.

[**11-5**]: PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The ET tube tip is
positioned within the mid to lower trachea, approximately 2 cm
above the carina. There is an NG tube seen, with the tip in the
stomach. The patient has a pacemaker overlying the left
hemithorax, with leads positioned within the right atrium and
ventricle. There is a lead overlying the right hemithorax, with
the tip positioned within the ventricle. There is cardiomegaly.
The lungs are clear. No pleural effusions or pneumothorax is
seen. The pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. The
soft tissue and osseous structures are unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: ET tube and NG tube in satisfactory position.
Cardiomegaly.

EEG [**11-6**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to the presence
of
frequent epileptiform sharp and slow wave discharges seen over
the left
parietal temporal aregion and due to right temporal sharp and
slow wave
discharges seen independently and less frequently. In addition,
the
background is slow and disorganized. The first two abnormalities

suggest cortical dysfunction in the left parietal temporal
region as
well as right temporal cortical dysfunction. The third
abnormality
suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and is consistent
with a
mild encephalopathy. Regarding epilepsy, the frequent
epileptiform
discharges increase the risk of seizures. During this 20 minute
recording, there was no clear seizure activity recorded.

ECHO: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. A
left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left v
