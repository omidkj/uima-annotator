Please note that this dictation covers the dates of [**2189-2-18**] until [**2189-3-10**].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 86 year old
woman with a history of moderate/severe aortic stenosis,
pulmonary embolism, non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma and status
post CVP chemotherapy two weeks ago.  She was admitted on
[**2189-2-18**], onto the Oncology Service secondary to trigeminal
neuralgia and difficulty taking p.o.  The patient was
receiving intravenous fluid and intravenous pain medications.
The patient was followed by the Pain Service and was tried on
numerous therapeutic modalities including Dilaudid PCA, a
neuropathic pain [**Doctor Last Name 360**], and subcutaneous and intravenous
narcotics.

By hospital day number two, the patient's transaminases were
elevated with a mild elevation in alkaline phosphatase and
T-bili.  A right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed mild
dilatation of the common bile duct status post
cholecystectomy as well as a heterogenous liver which was a
non-specific finding.

The GI Team was consulted and there was a thought that the
patient might have cholangitis.  The patient was scheduled
for possible endoscopic retrogram cholangiopancreatography
and had spiked a low grade temperature up to 101.6 F., with
white count rising from 5 to 21.  The patient was empirically
placed on Levofloxacin and Flagyl.  The GI Team felt that the
patient most likely did not have a cholangitis and other
sources of infection were sought out.  The patient was found
to have an enterococcal urinary tract infection greater than
100,000 colonies, sensitive to Ampicillin.  Blood cultures
from [**2-20**] were subsequently no growth to date.

The patient was placed on Ampicillin but continued to have
difficulty with pain control due to the trigeminal neuralgia. She
was followed by the neurology and pain service but was unable to
have good pain control without associated sedation.  She
attempted a nerve block adn a variety of medications for
neuropathic pain without success.  In the setting of her
increasing pain med requirements, the patient developed a
decrease in mental status. The patient's O2 saturations decreased
to 50% on room air, increasing to the mid 80s on a non-
rebreather.  The patient was given Narcan times two, but the
arterial blood gas revealed the following numbers:  7.28, 56 and
76.

Chest x-ray revealed new focal left lower lobe infiltrate.
The patient had crackles in the left lower lobe and she was
given intravenous Lasix with 1.0 liters of urine output.  Due
to the patient's aortic stenosis, the patient's systolic
blood pressures decreased to the mid-80s and she was brought
to the Intensive Care Unit for management of her aspiration
pneumonia and her hypotension.

The patient was initially volume resuscitated and was treated
with Levaquin and Flagyl in addition to ampicillin both for
her enterococcal urinary tract infection as well as for the
aspiration pneumonia.  Over the next three or four days, her
oxygen requirement decreased and her mental status improved
significantly as she metabolized all of her narcotics. All
sedative medications were held and the patient was
transferred back to the floor.  She however once again
complained of escalating pain from her trigeminal neuralgia that
prevented her from talking and eating.

The patient was readmitted to the Intensive Care Unit
[**2189-3-6**] after having a repeat aspiration event.  At that
time, the patient had been restarted on tube feeds and the
thought was that the patient had aspirated a great deal of
her tube feeds.  Chest x-ray revealed mild congestive heart
failure and a worsening of her aspiration.  Arterial blood
gas revealed the following numbers:  7.21; 72; 90 on 100%
non-rebreather.  The patient was transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit once again for hypotension with systolic blood
pressures as low as 60, and worsening mental status in the
setting of an aspiration event.

The patient's code status was changed to "DO NOT RESUSCITATE"
"DO NOT INTUBATE" with no pressors.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Low grade lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's Grade 1 out of 3,
treated with Rituxan, status post one dose of CVP on [**2-12**];
diagnosis of lymphoma was made in [**2188-11-22**].
2.  Aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.8 cm squared.
Peak gradient is 109, mean gradient is 75.
3.  Hypothyroidism.
4.  Hysterectomy.
5.  Cholecystectomy.
6.  Osteoarthritis.
7.  Left hip surgical repair in [**2187**].
8.  Pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis.
9.  Shingles.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:
1.  Effexor.
2.  Ditropan.
3.  Levoxyl.
4.  Neurontin.

ALLERGIES:
1.  Dilantin.
2.  Iodine.
3.  Codeine.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Pulse 110; blood pressure 89/32; 20
respiratory rate; 96% on non-rebreather.  In general, the
patient responds to commands, interactive but somnolent.
Cardiac examination with a III/VI systolic murmur at the
right upper sternal border.  Lungs with fine crackles at
bases.  Abdomen with positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended, no rebound or guarding.  Extremities with no
edema.

LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 17.3, hematocrit 31.7,
platelets 141, INR 1.5, sodium 136, potassium 3.7, chloride
101, bicarbonate 27, BUN 12, creatinine 1.0, glucose 110.
ALT 25, AST 22, LDH 218, alkaline phosphatase 116, total
bilirubin 0.3, calcium 9.6, magnesium 1.6, lactate 1.3.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  As noted above, the patient had two
Intensive Care Unit admissions.  During the second Intensive
Care Unit admission, the patient's systolic blood pressure
was extremely low and the family had requested no heroic
measures including cardioversion, intubation or pressors.

The patient was volume resuscitated but remained hypoxic
mostly due to her aortic stenosis.  By hospital day number
two in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient started coughing
up large amounts of tube feeds.  She was deep suctioned
aggressively and her hypercarbia and hypoxia resolved over
the next two days.

The patient's mental status completely returned to [**Location 213**] and
the patient was weaned from 100% nonrebreather after two
liters nasal cannula.  The patient was placed on aspiration
precautions.  She was treated with Vancomycin and given Gram
positive cocci found in the sputum as well as a course of
Levofloxacin and Flagyl times ten days.  The patient remained
afebrile throughout the rest of her Intensive Care Unit stay.

Due to her aspiration events, the patient was considered for
a PEG tube.  The patient deferred given the fact that her
husband had a PEG tube and had numerous complications from it
and had died due to the complications of infection from the
PEG.  The patient was then placed on TPN.

As far as the patient's trigeminal neuralgia, the patient was
considered for vascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve
as well as gamma knife therapy since the patient had failed
medical therapy.  The patient has been followed by the pain
service throughout her entire stay and was followed and
evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] in Neurosurgery.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] believed that the patient was not a good
candidate for further decompression surgery for two reasons;
first, the patient would have to be intubated for the
procedure which she refuses, and secondly, the patient would
be undergoing the third decompressive procedure and if the
first two had not provided significant improvement, the third
was unlikely to do so.

Next, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] believed that gamma knife surgery
also was not appropriate since it would provide mild to
moderate relief of her pain and may take up to two or three
months to provide full benefit.  The patient needs
substantial and immediately relief of her trigeminal
neuralgia pain because she is at great risk of continued
aspiration of her oral secretions and recurrent aspiration
pneumonia.

Given this fact, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] believed that neither
surgical procedure could delivery the desired outcome and
these were deferred.  The pain service continued the patient
on a Lidocaine drip for 48 hours in
