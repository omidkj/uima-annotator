Allergies:
Clindamycin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 22864**]
Chief Complaint:
weakness and chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo M w/ CAD s/p PCI x2 (LAD 80%, First Diag 80%, [**2159**]), PMR,
COPD, B/L Pulm Embolism ([**2159**]), developed acute onset of
substernal chest pain at 8am on the day of admission. He states
that this was [**Last Name (un) **] similar to the anginal pain he used to have
prior to his PCI. This resolved with 3 doses of SLNTG. He then
went to see the nurse at his retirement community because he
felt unusually weak. At her urging, he went to the [**Hospital1 18**] [**Location (un) 620**]
ED. There he was given 2L NS for SBPs in the 80s and responded
well, he was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. In the ED, initial VS
99.4, 96, 88/50, 22, 100% on 2L. Pressure dropped as low as
61/34. TMAX in the ED was 101.6. Pt received total of 4LNS
initially with good UOP in the range of 75-100cc/hr. BP was
labile and continued to drop, prompting insertion of RIJ and
intiation of levophed (0.03). At all times, pt was mentating and
in NAD.
.
CTA was done to rule out PE: it showed no PE but did reveal RLL
PNA. Given his extensive list of reported allergies, he was
given vanco, clinda, flagyl for PNA. EKG was notable for LBBB
pattern in setting of RV lead pacing. Initial Trop 0.04 with CK
of 33 drawn 5 hours since the resolution of his chest pain.
.
On the floor, he denies having CP since early this morning. He
states that his breathing is slightly labored but also improved
since this AM. His family reports that he has been hospitalized
for aspiration PNA twice before and has required stress dose
steroids during these hospitalizations.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo with known CAD s/p PCI with DES x2 in [**2159**], h/o
adrenal insufficiency, Type II DM, ho PMR, who presented with
hypotension and sepsis and RLL aspiration pneumonia. Admitted to
ICU for < 24hrs.
.
# Hypotension/Sepsis - When the patient was admitted, he had a
leukocytosis and was febrile.  He was also hypotensive,
requiring a central venous line, levophed, and 6L of IV fluids.
It was felt that his likely infectious source was a right lower
lobe pneumonia.  After his admission to the MICU, he was
ultimately placed on vancomycin, clindamycin, and azithromycin.
His medication choices were limited secondary to his reported
allergies.  By the morning after his admission, the patient was
no longer pressor-dependent, and he reported that he felt much
better.  Also, the patient's antibiotic regimen was narrowed
down to just clindamycin.  He was called out of the MICU to the
medicine service, where treatment of his RLL aspiration and
adrenal insufficiency continued. He was afebrile on the medicine
service and white
count trended down to 11 by discharge. He was weaned off oxygen
and his ambulatory sats on discharge were normal. He was treated
with albuterol and atrovent nebulizers as well. Patient was on
day [**7-1**] for the Clindamycin and it was d/c'd since it was
causing him esophagitis. He was started on Augmentin 875mg PO
BID. Continued neb treatments and sputum culture on [**7-28**] and
showed mod growth for Proteus species, and mod growth for
Pseudomonas Aeruginosa which are pan-sensitive. He has pulmonary
follow-up as an outpatient and will likely need repeat films at
some point to document resolution of the pneumonia.

.
# Adrenal Insufficiency - Both the patient and his family stated
that he regularly takes 7mg prednisone daily for both his
polymyalgia rheumatica and for primary adrenal insufficiency.
On lab testing, he had an equivocal random cortisol level.  The
MICU decided to treat him with stress dose steroids with the
plan to taper him quickly back to his home dose.  Following
transfer to the floor, pulse steroids were discontinued, and the
patient was transitioned to oral prednisone 20 mg daily. He was
then placed on a prednisone taper per endocrine reccs: 20mg x 7
days ( on day [**4-24**]), then 15mg x7 days -> 10mg x 7 days -> back
to baseline at 7mg. Patient doing well, BP WNL, asymptomatic. He
was on Regular Insulin SS, FSG improved yesterday. Lantus was
d/c on [**7-30**] as per endocrine recommendations.

.
# Chest Pain / Troponin Leak - The patient presented with a
history of CAD s/p PCI x 2 in [**2159**] and pacer for sick sinus in
[**2158**] and revised in [**2163**].  Because he had had some chest pain,
it was decided to increase his aspirin dose while he was ruling
out.  However, it was not felt necessary to treat him with
heparin for ACS.  He did have a slight troponin elevation;
however, this was felt to be associated with his acute illness
in the setting of chronic kidney disease.  His CPK's were not
trending up.  The patient's antihypertensive and
afterload-reducing medications were held while he was
pressor-dependent.  On the day after his admission, the patient
was free of chest pain and his EKG's were at his baseline.  It
was determined that he did not need any cardiac intervention at
this point.  On the floor, the patient experienced another
episode of substernal chest pain, with radiation to the jaw.
ECG was equivocal, and cardiac enzymes were not elevated.  The
cardiology consult service did not believe the patient was
suffering from unstable angina, and did not recommend any
further medical or interventio
