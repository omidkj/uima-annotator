History of Present Illness:
Reliability: Patient was AAOx3 however did endorse seeing an
"extra man" in the room when asked how many persons where
present in room. History also obtained from patient's wife and
medical records from rehab and [**Hospital3 **] ED.
.
Patient is 68-year-old male with ESRD status post cadaver kidney
transplant in [**2130**] on tacrolimus/prednisone, type 1 diabetes,
CAD status post CABG x4, PVD status post right popliteal stent
and 2nd right toe amputation in addition to history of MRSA
osteomyelitis,
chronic lower extremity nonhealing ulcers, history of multiple
DVTs on Coumadin with IVC filter, diastolic heart failure,
multiple prior C. difficile episodes in [**2135**], [**2138**], and [**4-/2140**]
among other conditions that presents from rehab with confusion
and low oxygen saturation.
.
Patient was recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**2140-4-29**] for
nausea/vomiting with eating with GI work-up revealing
gastroparesis and C. difficile diarrhea treated with PO
vancomycin.
.
At some point, he was admitted to rehab for PT/OT. His rehab
course was complicated by pneumonia and urinary tract infection
(no culture data available), which were treated with a 7-day
course of Ceftin (course was started around [**2140-6-30**]). The
patient required about 2-3 L NC while he had pneumonia.
.
He was in his otherwise normal state of health at rehab until
about 2-3 days ago when he needed nebulizer treatments on Friday
and also developed supplemental oxygen requirement on Saturday
similar to what he needed when he had pneumonia about 3-4 weeks
ago. His wife also stated that at baseline his mental status has
been AAOx3 but he does seem forgetful with hallucinations (e.g.
little kid hiding in the corner) with any illness and
dehydration. Of note, he had a CXR on [**2140-7-14**] that was compared
to his prior chest x-ray showing clearing of bilateral
infiltrates and pneumonia - namely the prominent right perihilar
infiltrate and small left perihilar infiltrate.
.
At the Guardian [**Name (NI) **] rehab, BLS placed him on 100 % NRB for
hypoxemia (unknown number) with O2 sat in 90s.
.
He was taken to [**Hospital3 **] ED where he was thought to be "really
confused" with no focal neurological deficits or post-ictal
state. His O2 sat was low as well (unknown number). He received
500 cc of fluid and a ? dose of Ceftin. He was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] given that he received a transplant here.
.
VS prior to transfer from [**Hospital3 **] ED were T 98.8 BP 124/62 HR
71 RR 22 Glc 169
.
In the ED, initial VS were: Triage 17:52 0 97.2 52 90/46 16 98%
4L
.
He arrived to [**Hospital1 18**] ED with relative hypotension with blood
pressures of 90/40, saturating 96% on 2 L nasal cannula with
diffuse crackles and wheezes on his lung fields.
.
Of note, recent BP in clinic per [**Hospital1 581**] are 88/60, 102/82,
92/52, 118/80 from past 2 years. BP at rehab on [**2140-5-6**] was
121/80.
.
BP remained stable in ER, required 2 L NC throughout ER course.
.
Labs were performed
- WBC 3.7 Hgb 8.2 (of note baseline ~ 10) Plt 253 with Diff N
70.9 L 16.5 E 6.6
- INR 2.8 (in setting of coumadin therapy) PTT 44.3

.
Diagnostic testing was performed:
- ECG: Sinus bradycardia at 52 bpm, NA, NI except QTc 502 ms, no
ST/T changes or STEMI. Low voltage I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF.
Compared to prior dated [**2140-1-25**], rhythm is NSR at 87 bpm, QTc
427 ms
- CXR (prelim): layering effusion, scarring atelectasis in lower
base. Cardiomediastinal unchanged. IVC filter seen.
Impression: Bilateral pleural effusions and cephalization,
post-surgical changes in right lung without definite
consolidation.
.
He was given:
- hydrocortisone 100 mg IV x 1 for stress dose steroids
- cefepime 2 gm IV and vancomycin 1000 mg IV
- 2 L NS with urine output of 95 mL
.
VS on transfer: 18:38 53 100/41 17 97% on 2 L NC
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was AAOx3 but thought that
another man was standing behind me - which was not true. He was
also noted that have Tax 94. Urine output was poor, and he
received 2 L NS bolus.
.
He denies any localizing complaints such as cough, abdominal
pain, dysuria although does admit to low oxygen levels.
.
