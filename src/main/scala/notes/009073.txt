Penicillins / Lipitor

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
epigastric pain, increasing dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP s/p spincterotomy
EGD x 2
blood transfusion

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 71 year old Chinese but English-speaking male
with a history of ?renal artery stenosis, chronic renal
insufficiency (Cr 4.8 at [**Hospital1 **]), HTN and DM2 with no known CAD
who presented to [**Hospital 5871**] hospital on [**5-4**] with epigastric pain x
1 week and increasing dyspnea on exertion x 3-4 days. The
patient denies any chest pain but notes that in the past [**2-25**]
days he has difficulty walking a few steps before he feels short
of breath. He lives upstairs and has difficulty walking up 3-4
steps at a time secondary to shortness of breath. He also admits
to increasing lower extremity edema. He uses 2 pillows at night
which has not increased recently.
.
Regarding his abdominal pain, the patient first noted this 1
week ago in the RUQ, epigastrium.  He says it only hurts with
palpation. He also noted pain after meals but denies
nausea/vomiting and states that he is tolerating PO.  He denies
diarrhea/constipation but states that his stool looks
"yellowish" and that his urine is dark. He denies
pruritus/jaundice.  He denies fevers but admits to chills. No
night sweats or weight loss.
.
At [**Hospital1 **], a RUQ U/S was performed which showed dilatation of
the intrahepatic biliary ducts and common bile duct which
measures 1.2 cm. The pancreatic duct was also dilated.  The
gallbladder had no stones.  The findings were suggestive of
distal CBD stone or mass.
An CXR showed increased lung markings in the right lung.
Furthermore, his labs showed elevated ALP of 186, bili WNL,
amylase 188, lipase 75, WBC 14.2, and BNP [**2055**]. Troponin 0.03,
CK 62.
.
The patient was then transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation. He was found to be hypertensive to the 200-240 range
despite having taken his am meds.  He was given 10 mg IV
hydralazine x 2, lopressor 5 mg IV x 1, and clonidine 0.3 mg X
1.  His BP returned to 180.
.
ROS:  As above. Denies any cough. Chills but no fevers/night
sweats. No HA/blurry vision.

Pertinent Results:
Renal Angiogram [**2144**]: 50% R RAS, 14 mm Hg gradient
.
Colonoscopy [**4-14**]: Benign Polyp at 20 cm (polypectomy).  Mild
diverticulosis of R colon.  Small hemorrhoids
.
EGD [**4-14**]: Non-obstructing esophageal ring in lower esophagus.
Small hiatal hernia.  Gastritis (biopsy).  Duodenitis.
.
RUQ U/S @ OSH [**5-4**]: dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary ducts
and common bile duct which measures 1.2 cm.  The pancreatic duct
was also dilated. The gallbladder had no stones.
.
CXR [**5-5**]: Patchy opacities over lying the right lung concerning
for
pneumonia.  If there are no infectious symptoms, bronchoalveolar
carcinoma should be considered.
.
TTE [**5-5**]: 1. There is mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity
size. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).  2. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.  3. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened.  4. There is a small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
.
CT Abd/Pelvis [**5-5**]: Limited study secondary to lack of IV
contrast. Dilated common bile duct without evidence of ductal
stone. Possible prominence of the pancreatic head, but no
definite masses identified. MRCP could be helpful for further
evaluation. Multiple poorly defined patchy opacity seen at the
right lung base, incompletely characterized. Findings are
concerning for pneumonia, however, if there is a lack of
infectious symptoms, bronchoalveolar carcinoma could have a
similar appearance. Followup imaging recommended to document
resolution.
.
MRI Renal/MRCP [**5-5**]: 1. Intra- and extrahepatic biliary
dilatation, down to the level of the ampulla. No filling defects
or stones are identified. Vague area of enhancement is seen in
the expected location of the ampulla. Findings suggest ampullary
stenosis and further evaluation is recommended with an ERCP
examination. Underlying ampullary neoplasm cannot be excluded.
2. Evidence of chronic pancreatitis with moderate stenosis of
the pancreatic duct in the pancreatic head. No definite
pancreatic head mass is identified. This finding can also be
evaluated by ERCP.
3. Moderately distended gallbladder with wall edema. Given the
evidence of third spacing of fluid, this is a nonspecific
finding.
4. Bilateral renal artery stenosis, right side greater than
left.
.
ERCP [**5-8**]: 1. The papilla was extremely tight, consistent with
ampullary stenosis.
2. Limited pancreatogram showed a somewhat ectatic duct,
consistent with chronic pancreatitis. No obvious strictures or
filling defects were seen.
3. The common bile duct was somewhat dilated. There was a
suggestion of small filling defects in the distal duct upon
initial contrast injection, which were not seen when the duct
was more fully filled out. This is consistent with
microlithiasis/sludge. No strictures or evidence of obstruction
were seen.
4. A sphincterotomy was performed in the 12 o'clock position
using a sphincterotome over an existing guidewire. Upon
sphincterotomy, the ampulla appeared somewhat full and bulging.
This area was biopsied with cold forceps for histology to rule
out neoplasm.
5. Microlithiasis was extracted successfully using a 11 mm
balloon.
.
EGD [**5-9**]: 1. Ongoing bleeding at sphincterotomy site. Achieved
hemostasis with submucosal epinephrine injection.
.
EGD [**5-10**]: 1. The sphincterotomy site was again seen actively
bleeding.  Upon irrigating and suctioning, clear bile was seen
draining into the duodenum.  2. A 7 Fr gold probe electrocautery
device was applied for hemostasis successfully. The site was
irrigated with saline and no further bleeding was seen.
