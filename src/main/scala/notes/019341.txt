History of Present Illness:
History of Present Illness (adapted from Med Consult Note by Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6137**] and Neurology Note by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]):
64 F with HCV, initially admitted to [**Hospital6 20592**] with mental status changes and fever. Per her husband,
she was found speaking "gibberish" and groaning, not following
commands. On the way to the hospital, they had stopped at a
railroad crossing, at which time she tried to exit the vehicle,
and needed to be restrained.
.
Of note, she had presented to her PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 15131**], at [**University/College **]
Mass on [**10-11**] with a herpetic-rash on the right side of her face
and back. These were cultured and grew MSSA, and treated with
Bactroban and Keflex.
.
Her review of systoms is otherwise negative. Specifically, she
has had no recent travel history, any hiking or any recent sick
contacts or unusual exposures. According to the husband, the
patient was fine about 1 week ago.
.
At [**Location (un) **], a head CT showed bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhages.
In addition, her laboratory values were significant for a plt
62, Hct 28, Cr 1.6, and TBili 2.2. Of note, in [**2147-4-18**], her plt
was 231 and Hct 33. Her creat in [**2146-5-19**] was 0.7.
.
Of note, her [**Location (un) **] labs also included a tox screen that was
positive for benzos, amphetamines, and opiates.
.
She was transferred to the neurosurgery service here at the
[**Hospital1 18**]. Here, she was loaded with dilantin, a R radial A-line
placed, and CT imaging performed of her head and neck. This
showed subarachnoid hemorrhages in her right frontal, left
frontal, and left parietooccipital lobes. In addition, a 2-mm
aneurysm from the supraclinoid internal carotid artery was
visualized, as well as a subcentimeter lesion along the left
parietotemporal lobe likely representing a meningioma. An LP was
also performed, which showed 450 RBCs, 110 WBCs, with 81% polys
and 14% bands. She was given vanco, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and
acyclovir.
.
Her course here is also significant for finding of a cool,
cyanotic right hand after placement of the right radial A-line.


Past Medical History:
Hepatitis C, according to husband pt has been treated with an
incomplete course of Interferon in the past at [**Hospital3 2358**]
unsuccessfully; he denies any h/o cirrhosis but he is a poor
historian
Anemia (unclear baseline or etiology)
Fibromyalgia
Depression
s/p tubal ligation
s/p D&C
s/p tonsillectomy


Social History:
married, lives with husband; former ER nurse, abruptly ended
job, but never gave an explanation to husband or family; no
Etoh; h/o IVDU


Family History:
noncontributory

Physical Exam:

100%, wt 54.2 kg
AC 450x20/0.4/5.0
General - Intubated and sedated
HEENT - Sclera anicteric, PERRL, C-collar in place
CV - tachy, but regular; [**1-24**] syst mur best heard at apex
Chest - Course ventilated breath sounds, but grossly CTAB
Abd - no stigmata of chronic liver diseasea; NABS, soft, NT/ND,
no g/r; no hepatosplenomegaly; R femoral A-line c/d/i
Ext - no edema; R hand, and bilat L>R feet cool and cyanotic
appearing
Skin - no patechia; ? [**Last Name (un) 1003**] & Oslers lesions on L hand


Pertinent Results:
AP Chest ([**10-16**]) - The tip of an endotracheal tube projects
approximately 2.9 cm above the carina.  The proximal sideport of
a nasogastric tube is below the diaphragm though the tip courses
below the confines of the radiograph. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is unremarkable, and the lungs are grossly clear
without evidence of overt edema. There is no evidence of pleural
effusion or pneumothorax.
.
CTA Head/Neck ([**10-16**]): Several foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage
in the right frontal, left frontal, left parietooccipital lobes
are noted.  There is minimal associated edema without evidence
of mass effect or infarction.  A 5-mm extra-axial lesion (2, 18)
along the left parietotemporal lobe may represent a meningioma.
The carotid and vertebral arteries and their major branches are
patent with no evidence of stenosis.  There is a 2-mm aneurysm
in the posterior margin of the supraclinoid internal carotid
artery.
.
CT Head ([**10-17**]): New 4 mm hemorrhage within the left posterior
thalamic region. In conjunction with evidence of one and
possibly two infarcts within the left parietal lobe region, as
well as the rather posteriorly situated area of subarachnoid
blood, it seems unlikely that the left supraclinoid internal
carotid artery aneurysm is cause for any of the hemorrhagic or
ischemic lesions seen.  Trauma could certainly account for the
subarachnoid hemorrhage but would seem less likely as a cause of
the thalamic hemorrhage.


Brief Hospital Course:
64 F with Staph Aureus bacteremia including endocarditis,
pneumonia, and meningitis.
.
Bacteremia/septic shock - GPC cultures growing from blood,
urine, and sputum, with wbc in CSF and vegetations on mitral
valve.  Possibly stemming from recent MSSA skin lesion.  PT
started on gentamycin, vancomycin and acyclovir, but was
switched to nafcillin as cultures showed MSSA.  C/s ID for
appropriate antibiotic use.  Gave fluid bolluses to maintained
BP, but eventulally ussed pressors to continue to support BP
.
Respiratory failure - Intubated in ED for airway protection
respiratory alkalosis.  Morphine for comfort while intubated
.
Endocarditis:  Pt with heart murmer and evidence for Mitral
regurg and vegitations seen on TTE.  Clinical signs of septic
emboli throught body.  TEE was performed to better define extent
of disease, and cardiology and CT surtery were consulted.  Pt's
family decided to not consider surgery in acute period, so daily
EKG's were performed to monitor cardiac progress
.
AMS: Pt presented with AMS and evidence of SAH on CT scan.
Given Endocarditis, septic emboli are likely cause, but many
other possible causes.  Given elevated WBC on LP, could be
encephalitis, and viral cultures are pending.  Thrombocytopenia
not severe enough to cause hemorage. There was concern for
domestic abuse, but pattern of injury does not suggest trauma,
and other more likely causes. Repeat head CT from [**10-18**] shows no
new hemorrhage.  Pt showed signs of flaicd paraysis.  Given ICH
nsgy and neuro recommended to trasnfuse platelets to goal of 70
and continue dilantin for seizure prophylaxis.  We did not
administer anticoagulants based on the concern for new or
reoccurance of intracranial hemorrhage.
.
Thrombocytopenia:  Given overal septic picture, likely from DIC.
 Baseline labs from [**4-24**] with plt in 230s. Schistocytes on
smear reviewed overnight and an elevated LDH, along with mental
status changes, fever, and renal failure raises concern for TTP;
However, Hct stable and normal haptoglobin. Time course too
rapid for HIT. Recent abx use for treatment of MSSA skin lesion
may be precipitant for ITP. Cool extremities also raises
consideration of arterial thrombi.  Abdominal US showed no
splenic enlargement, so sequestration is less likely.  Heme was
consulted to hep determine origin and possible treatments.
.
Acute renal failure: creat elevated from 0.7 last year; FeNa
last night consistent with prerenal physiology. TTP also in the
differential, as are arterial or septic thromboemboli.  Pt was
hydrated based on CVP, but eventually pt becam anuric.
.
Pt had thrombosis of R radial artery, and went to the OR with
vascular surgery for venous graft.  Post op the venous graft
clotted as well due to the lack of anticoagulation due to ICH.
Simutaneously extensive clot burden was extending in the legs
and throughout the right arm.  The option of amputation was
discussed with the family, but was decided against given the
poor prognosis.
