BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF [**Hospital **] HOSPITAL COURSE PRIOR TO
MEDICAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT TRANSFER ON [**2199-5-3**]:

Mr. [**Known lastname 39162**] is an 84-year-old male with a past medical history
significant for congestive heart failure, atrial
fibrillation, status post DDD pacer, hypertension,
hypolipidemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, who was
admitted initially on [**2199-4-4**] after an MVC complicated
by hypovolemic shock secondary to hemoperitoneum.  The
patient had a subsequent laparotomy with repair by mesenteric
lead and cecal serosal tear.  The patient had a difficult
weaning from the ventilator secondary to volume overload, and
thick secretions.  He was ultimately extubated on [**4-14**]
while still febrile with a sputum growing gram negative rods.
He was transferred originally to the Medical Intensive Care
Unit on [**4-17**], continued pulmonary toilet with frequent
suctioning.  The patient had been treated empirically with a
course of levofloxacin for gram negative pneumonia.

On the General Medical Service, the patient's mental status
continued to wax and wane.  It had never fully recovered.
The patient's C spine was unable to be cleared clinically by
plain radiograph and CT scan of the cervical spine secondary
to this mental status.

On [**4-19**], the patient failed a swallow evaluation and
continued tube feeds.  Aggressive diuresis lead to worsening
alkalosis.  The patient was transferred to the floor on [**4-24**] still requiring suctioning.  A Neurology Consult was
obtained on [**4-30**] for delirium which was thought to be
secondary to hypoxia and hypercarbia from obstructive sleep
apnea which was complicated by possible palatal weakness from
an old posterior circulation CVA.  There is felt to be a
possible contribution from a possible shear injury status
post CMCD.

The patient's antibiotics were changed from levofloxacin to
Flagyl to Zosyn on [**4-30**] for aspiration pneumonitis.  A
plain tracheostomy was intended for [**2199-4-2**], however,
while on the medical floor, the patient experienced a
hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring emergent
intubation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  By problems:

1.  Respiratory failure:  The patient's original intubation
on [**5-3**] was likely related to upper airway obstruction
from obstruction sleep apnea, possibly secondary to palatal
weakness from central lesion concomitant with copious thick
secretions that he was unable to clear out.  His initial gas
peri-intubation was 7.12, 72, 61.  The patient underwent a
tracheotomy on [**2199-5-3**] performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 952**].  While
in the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient finished a
course of Zosyn for a presumed aspiration pneumonia.  He
continued with >........<level of care secondary to copious
secretions which were noted to be thick, white, frothy
secretions.  He required suctioning every 30-60 minutes
progressing to every 2-3 hours.  The patient remained on
continuos trache collar since [**2199-4-5**] with FIO2 set at
0.35 and oxygen saturations greater than 95%.  To maintain
his secretions, guaifenesin was added on [**5-8**] and
continued.  The patient continued to oxygenate and ventilate
well on trache collar, and his tracheostomy tube was changed
to a nonfenestrated number 6 cuffless on [**2199-3-15**].
Aspiration precautions were continued throughout his
Intensive Care Unit stay.  The patient's chest x-ray on [**5-3**] was consistent with mild congestive heart failure,
however, subsequent to chest x-ray's on [**5-4**], [**5-6**],
and [**5-8**], demonstrated no significant pulmonary vascular
engorgement and clear pulmonary parenchyma.  There were small
bilateral pleural effusions present in these x-ray's however.
The patient's respiratory failure was felt secondary to his
obstructive sleep apnea and recommended that the patient
undergo a polysomnogram in the future to be evaluated for
CPAP during the evenings.  He was sleeping comfortably with
trach in place.  Once his cardiopulmonary status and neurologic
status improves, he needs his OSA reevaluated.  He will
likely need a split night study, with brief diagnostic PSG,
followed by CPAP titration, both with trach capped.  If he
benefits from CPAP in sleep lab, he will need CPAP trial at
home.  Depending how he does with CPAP (with trach capped), he
will then need reevaluation of what to do with trach (question
of decanulation).  Suggest referral to Sleep Disorders Center
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 39163**]) when improved, for evaluation and assistence with
this.  This information was stated on discharge papers.

2. Altered mental status: Mr. [**Known lastname 39162**] had waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**]
mental status while being on the medical floor.  After being
transferred to Medical Intensive Care Unit, the patient's
mental status continued to improve.  The underlying etiology
was unclear, although, was felt to be secondary to a toxic
metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with a possible
component of injury to the brain sustained in the MVC.  The
patient continued to improve in alertness and orientation and
on the day prior to discharge, the patient was oriented to
person, place and date.  The patient's mental status improved
such that we were able to remove the C spine collar ([**Location (un) 2848**] J)
that had been placed upon admission on [**4-4**], plain
radiographs of his C spine were obtained on [**4-4**] with CT
scan of his C spine on [**4-5**] were negative.  The patient's
C spine was cleared clinically on [**2199-5-15**].

3.  Acute renal failure:  Upon admission to the Intensive
Care Unit, the patient's creatinine was elevated to 1.7.  His
acute renal failure was felt to be secondary to over-diuresis
and prerenal azotemia.  His diuretics were initially held and
his renal function returned to baseline with creatinine of
0.9 to 1.1 throughout the remainder of this hospital course.
As his renal function improved, the patient's ACE inhibitor
was re-initiated for blood pressure control.

4.  Hypertension:  Mr. [**Known lastname 39164**] antihypertensives were
discontinued upon admission and his blood pressures began to
rise to systolics in the 180s.  While his creatinine level
was elevated, he received several doses of hydralazine.  He
was titrated up on Captopril and Metoprolol to achieve
excellent blood pressure control with a dose of Metoprolol
37.5 b.i.d. and Captopril 12.5 t.i.d.  His Captopril was
changed to Lisinopril on [**2199-5-15**].  On these two
medications, the patient's blood pressure ranged between
91-140 systolic/35-68 diastolic on the day prior to
discharge.

5.  Hematologic:  While admitted to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit, the patient required one unit of packed red blood
cells on [**2199-5-5**].  Subsequent daily hematocrits were
followed and remained stable above 30%.  Mr. [**Known lastname 39162**] will
require repeat blood counts as an outpatient to ensure that
his anemia is resolving.

6.  Atrial fibrillation/Congestive heart failure: The patient
is status post DDD pacer for atrial fibrillation and was
maintained on amiodarone for rhythm control.
Electrocardiograms demonstrated other AV pacing or sinus
rhythm.  Patient's heart rates remained in the 70s.  The
patient was in mild heart failure on admission to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.  >........<was withheld secondary to
renal failure, and the patient's congestive heart failure
improved significantly with positive pressure while on the
ventilator.  He remained on Metoprolol and Captopril was
re-initiated on [**5-5**].  The patient tolerated diuresis
with furosemide 40 intravenous b.i.d. with a goal I & O met
at negative 1 liter per day. The patient's etiology of
congestive heart failure was felt to be diastolic dysfunction
as >........<70%.  Please see prior dictation for further
details.

7.  Gastrointestinal/Fluid, electrolytes and nutrition:  As
Mr. [**Known lastname 39164**] mental status had significantly improved, a
swish and swallow evaluation was performed on [**5-14**] which he
failed.  The patient was >.........<aspirate thin liquids and
he is to remain NP
