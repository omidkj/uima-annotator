Repeat CXR on [**5-12**]: Tip of the new right internal jugular line
ends in the upper SVC. There is no
mediastinal widening, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. There
is new

Brief Hospital Course:
# Hypotension/Pneumonia: Patient was admitted to the ICU with
tachycardia, fever, and hypotension which was felt most likely
from acute pneumonia given cough, pleuritis, and opacities on
CXR.  Pt was covered with Vancomycin/Levofloxacin due to her
history of MRSA PNA.  She was aggressively fluid resuscitated
and supported with pressors with resolution of hypotension.  Pt
did not require ventilator support and later had significant
autodiuresis of large volumes of urine and BP remained stable
off pressors.   She was called out to the floor with resolution
of fevers.  Additional infectious work up included multiple
negative Urine & Blood Cx, an echo that did not show any
vegetations, negative HIV viral load, negative Viral Influenza
screen and negative Legionella Antigen. Leukocytosis continued
to resolve on Linezolid with high dose Levofloxacin.   Pt was
continued on Linezolid for an 8 day course and pre-authorization
was obtained for po Linezolid on discharge to sober house.
Levofloxacin was transitioned to Moxifloxacin to complete the 8
day course due to insurance approval requirements.
.
# Abnomal LFTs: Pt reports intermittent RUQ pain and initial u/s
showed small amount of ascites though not enough for
paracentesis and LFTs revealed a mildly elevated transaminases
with mild Alk Phos elevation.  Hepatitis panel was sent and
returned positive for Hep C Ab though Hep C VL was negative.
Hep B studies revealed prior immunization and repeated RUQ u/s
was performed prior to discharge which showed small periportal
lymphadenopathy.  These results were discussed with the patient
and she was given an appointment to follow up with the liver
clinic for further investigation.
.
# Narcotic addiction:  Pt was continued on Methadone at
confirmed clinic doses but had an epsiode of somnolence in the
ICU thought due to multidrug interaction.  There was concern
raised for in hospital drug abuse though repeat urine drug
screen returned positive for opiates (on Methadone) and
barbituates (on Fioricet) without any unexplained positive
substances on the screen.  Given this concern, all visitors were
screened prior to visits.  After being transitioned to medical
floor, pt was restarted on her home medication regimen including
Clonidine, Clonazepam and Methadone with mild intermittent
somnolence though
