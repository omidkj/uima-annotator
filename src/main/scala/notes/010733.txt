Chief Complaint:
Back hurting, f/c


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
76yoM with h/o CAD s/p LAD, LCx, and OM stenting, moderate AS,
COPD/asbestosis, PVD s/p bilateral common iliac stents, prostate
ca s/p XRT and hormonal therapy, bladder ca, DM who presents
with fevers/chills and back pain.
.
Pt with 3-4d of bilateral flank/back pain, coming and going.
Then, this morning was going to get blood work from his family
doctor, routine bloodwork. Got back home and laid down because
wasn't feeling well, fatigued, and awoke with tremulousness,
sweats, SOB, and bilateral back pain.
.
In the ED: initial Vitals:  100.9  82  148/70  20  97% 4L NC. Pt
noted to spike to 101.4 in the ED. CXR with wet read concerning
for consolidation in LLL and UA noted to be very positive, in
setting of positive CVA tenderness in the ED.
.
Patient was given 500 mg PO Tylenol and 750 mg IV Levaquin. Most
Recent Vitals: 99.2 102 127/50 26 96% 4L NC
.
Otherwise, no dysuria, abdominal pain, n/v, hematuria, cloudy
urine, BRBPR/melena, CP, angina. Pt endorses chronic dyspnea,
possible decreased exercise tolerance for a month, possible
occasional PND, but no BLE edema. Unclear if this pattern is
accelerating though, as pt not too specific historian. ROS
otherwise negative.

IMAGING
-------------
CT chest: 1. Combination of volume loss and dense consolidation
in all basal segments of the left lower lobe makes it difficult
to assess the relative contributions of atelectasis and
pneumonia; although there may be mild lymph node enlargement in
the lower lobe, and a tiny nodule in the superior segmental
bronchus, this is not a picture of obstructive pneumonia.
Function of the left hemidiaphragm should be assessed.
2. Pleural effusions are small if any. Despite asbestos-related
pleural
plaques, there is no good evidence for asbestosis (pulmonary
fibrosis).
3. Moderately severe emphysema. Possible pulmonary arterial
hypertension
(MPA equals 34 mm, RPA equals 28 mm).
4. Severe coronary atherosclerosis. Potentially significant
aortic valvular calcification.
.
Echo: Moderate calcific aortic stenosis. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal global and regional
biventricular systolic Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
hypertension.
.
LENIS: Negative study for deep vein thrombosis.
.
CXR:  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema, mediastinal vascular
engorgement have progressed since [**1-21**]. Left lower lobe
atelectasis and very small left pleural effusion have not
changed appreciably. Mediastinal vasculature is engorged and
mild cardiomegaly has progressed. No pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
76 year old male with PMH DM, CAD (2VD LAD in [**2121**], LCX and OM),
moderate AS, PVD (s/p BL common iliac stenting),
COPD/asbestosis, Prostate CA, Bladder CA who presented to the ED
w/ fever, chills, and low back pain. Now experiencing increasing
oxygen requirement, new onset atrial fibrillation with [**Hospital 26875**]
transferred to MICU where he underwent CT scan and was found to
have LLL pneumonia
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
# GNR SEPTICEMIA: patient presented with bilateral flank pain
and fevers at home for several days prior to admission.
Urinalysis on admission was grossly positive and patient was
initially treated with ceftriaxone.  Patient continued to have
fevers, worsening hypotension and tachycardia despite
ceftriaxone and fluid repleation and was broadened to cefepime.
Due to the patient's tight aortic stenosis and development of
afib with rapid ventricular response patient's volume repleation
could not be managed on the floor and patient was transfered to
the MICU for management of his sepsis.  Cultures ultimately grew
a ciprosensitive klebsiella in both the blood and urine and the
patient was treated with levofloxacin.  His vital signs
stabilized and blood cultures cleared and he was discharged by
to the general medicine [**Hospital1 **].  Infectious diseases were
consulted for a course of antibiotics given his non-obstructive
renal calculi and endovascular stents and the patient was
discharged on a 28 day course of ciprofloxacin 500 mg [**Hospital1 **] with
ID follow up on [**2129-2-
