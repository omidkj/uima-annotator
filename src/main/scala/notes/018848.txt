History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 53 Y M with Hx of DM2, HTN who is transferred from
[**Hospital3 **] after being hospitalized from [**6-5**] - [**6-12**]
with bilateral pneumonia and concern for new malignancy.  2
weeks prior to admission to the OSH, he was experiencing
cold-like symptoms and received Azithromycin without relief.
This was switched to Levaquin, again without improvement.  He
claimed that for these 2 weeks, he was basically bed-bound and
extremely tired.  At the end of that time, he was coughing to
where "my face turned [**Doctor Last Name 352**]" and had some sputum production and
low-grade fevers.  He received a CXR which showed bilateral PNA;
he was admitted to the [**Hospital1 2436**] ICU for hypoxic respiratory
failure and Pneumosepsis.  On [**6-5**] he started Ceftriaxone,
Azithromycin, and IV steroids for supposed concurrent COPD
exacerbation.  He also received 1 dose of Vancomycin.  He could
not tolerate BiPAP and was given nasal O2.  His respiratory
status stabalized and was transferred to the floor requiring 4L
of NC.  He claims that during his hospital stay, he did not feel
that his breathing had improved.  Urinary Legionella Ag and
strep Ag were negative as were MRSA screen and blood cultures
drawn on [**6-5**].  CTPA was negative for PE but did reveal
mediastinal and retroperitoneal adenopathy.  CT of the abdomen
and pelvis a 6.3x4.8cm mass, "concern for a renal cell carcinoma
vs. lymphoma."  The patient was agreeable for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]
for work-up of this potential malignancy.
.
On arrival, he mentions orthopnea and LE edema which began
around the time he started his cold and has worsened.  He also
mentions that the afternoon of transfer, he experienced 1 minute
of blurry vision where his daughter noted his left pupil was
bigger than the right but resolved spontaneously without any
associated headaches, nausea, confusion, or vomiting.

CT Chest [**5-15**]
FINDINGS:  The thyroid gland is unremarkable.  There is no
supraclavicular or
axillary lymphadenopathy.  There is extensive mediastinal and
hilar
lymphadenopathy, similar in extent to the prior study from only
a few days
earlier. For example, right anterior mediastinal node measuring
1.5 x 1.5 cm,
previously measured 1.6 x 1.4 cm (4:11); 2.2 x 1.2 cm right
precarinal node
(4:20), previously measured 1.2 x 2.3 cm; more inferiorly, 2.5 x
1.9 cm node
(4:23), previously was 2.5 x 2.0 cm.  Multiple nodes are seen in
the
prevascular station which also are similar in appearance to the
prior exam.
Right paraesophageal nodal conglomerate  is unchanged and
measures 4.9 x 3.7
cm (4:33).   Large right hilar nodal conglomerate, measures 4.9
cm in maximal
dimension (4:28) compared to 4.8 cm.  Left hilar adenopathy
measures 4.1 cm
(4:29) compared to 4.3 cm.  There is resultant compression of
the right main
stem bronchus (4:27) and bronchus intermedius as well as the
right lower lobe
bronchus.   The heart has a rounded appearance with a small
pericardial
effusion.  This concerning for pericardial constriction from
underlying
process involving the lungs and mediastinum.

LUNGS:  In the right upper lobe there are multiple foci of
consolidation,
multiple nodules, ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal
thickening.
This pattern is also seen in the right lower lobe but is less
extensive.  More
frank consolidation with air bronchograms are present in the
right middle lobe
and left lower lobe.  Within the left upper lobe there are
innumerable
predominantly sub-centimeter discrete rounded nodules.  There
are bilateral
pleural effusions greater on the right, similar in extent
compared to the
prior study. These findings are suggestive of primary lung
malignancy,
lymphoma, possible infection such as tuberculosis and less
likely vasculitis.
There is no pneumothorax.

This study is limited for evaluation of subdiaphragmatic
structures but
demonstrates extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, better
assessed on the
recent outside hospital scan with IV contrast, however, the
overall extent
appears unchanged.  For example, right retroperitoneal node
measuring 1.7 x
2.8 cm (4:63), previously measured 1.4 x 2.7 cm on the prior
study; epigastric
node measuring 1.8 cm, is similar to the prior study (4:57);
left paraaortic
nodal conglomerate measures 3.2 x 2.3 cm compared to 3.2 x 2.1
cm on the prior
study.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There are no suspicious bony lesions.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Multifocal process within the lungs with frank consolidation
in the right
middle and left lower lobes, severe multifocal opacities with
nodules,
centrilobular septal thickening in the right upper lobe and less
extensive in
the right lower lobe with multiple nodules in the left upper
lobe.  Extensive
mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, unchanged from the prior
exam.
Possible etiologies include primary lung cancer, lymphoma,
infection such as
TB and less likely vasculitis.
2.  Associated compression of the right main stem bronchus,
