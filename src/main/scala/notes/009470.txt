Date of Birth:   [**2041-11-27**]       Sex:  M

Service:  MICU

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Respiratory failure.
2.  CV instability.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 68-year-old male
with a history of type 2 diabetes who presented with a
history of subjective chills times one day prior to
admission.  On the PM of admission per report, the patient's
eyes "glazed over" during dinner.  The patient had nausea,
positive fever / chills, positive shortness of breath,
positive facial flushing.  No vomiting, abdominal pain or
sick contacts or suspect food.  Per report, the patient was
driving erratically to dinner and once tripped.

The family took the patient to the emergency room where his
temperature was 101.2 F, respiratory rate of 20, blood
pressure 165/82.  The patient was saturating at 89% on room
air.  The patient was reportedly stable until he developed an
episode of lip smacking and became unresponsive with rigors
"neuro curbsided and doubted there were seizures".  Patient
was 75% on nonrebreather, withdrawing to pain and was
intubated secondary to decreased O2 saturation and airway
protection.

ABG at that time was 7.24 / 73 / 76 with a lactate of 1.2.
Patient was covered with Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin and admitted
to the MICU (source family, ER resident).

In the MICU, the patient was febrile with a temperature of
103.0 F, blood pressure 180/130 to 85/40, pulse 123,
respiratory rate 12, 96% on ventilation, AC 700 by 12, fio2
of 0.6.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general the patient was an
intubated and sedated elderly man with small minimally
reactive pupils with mild conjunctival irritation. The right
TM was clear.  The left not visualized.  ET and OT tubes were
in place.  Patient was flushed.  CV:  Tachycardia, regular
rate and rhythm, S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Respiratory:  Breath sounds bilaterally, right greater than
left.  Anterior greater than posterior, lower lung volume
symmetric, negative rales.  Abdomen:  Positive bowel sounds,
soft, no masses.  Rectal:  Heme positive grossly brown stool.
Extremities:  Pulses intact, warm, mild follicular rash on
chin, mild edema, no cyanosis or clubbing.  Neuro:  Toes
down, normal ................, patient non-responsive.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Type 2 diabetes.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Status post disc surgery.
4.  Chronic sinusitis.
5.  History of "difficulty swallowing".
6.  Hemorrhoids.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient is married, no alcohol use, no
intravenous drug use.  Remote tobacco history.  Patient is
retired.

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  Metformin 1 gram b.i.d.
