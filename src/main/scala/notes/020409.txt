CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
FINDINGS: This study is somewhat limited by motion artifact.
There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, shift of
normally midline structures, mass effect, hydrocephalus, or
acute major vascular territorial infarction. The ventricular
system is normal in size and configuration. There are small
fluid levels in the left maxillary sinus and left sphenoid sinus
air cell. A few of the ethmoid air cells are opacified. The
mastoid air cells remain clear. There is no concerning osseous
or surrounding soft tissue abnormality.
.
IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage, evidence of cerebral
edema or acute major vascular territorial infarction. Small
fluid levels in the left maxillary and sphenoid sinuses.
.
[**2150-2-28**]
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The visualized lung bases
demonstrate pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small
on the left. There is associated compressive atelectasis of the
dependent lower lobes. The gallbladder appears to be intact with
normal wall enhancement and no evidence of cholelithiasis or
appreciable wall thickening. A small amount of fluid layers
around the liver into [**Location (un) 6813**] pouch. The liver is
unremarkable without focal lesion. The portal vein is patent.
The spleen, pancreas and adrenal glands are unremarkable. There
are bilateral subcentimeter scattered hypodensities of each
kidney which are too small to characterize but probably cysts.
Kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically and the
ureters fill with contrast and are of normal caliber. Evaluation
of the large and small bowel is limited without oral contrast.
Intraluminal fluid is noted throughout the entire colon as well
as several loops of small bowel. There is pancolonic wall
thickening. The terminal ileum is unremarkable. There is no
evidence of obstruction or focally dilated loops.
.
CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A small amount of low-density
fluid layers into the pelvis. The rectum, uterus, adnexa are
unremarkable. There is a Foley catheter within the decompressed
urinary bladder.
.
BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lesions are seen.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. No CT evidence of gallbladder perforation. Findings on
ultrasound probably relate to the presence of small amount of
free fluid surrounding the liver and extending into the
gallbladder fossa in combination with partial imaging of
adjacent fluid filled colon.
2. Pancolonic wall thickening consistent with colitis.
Infectious etiology considered more likely
3. Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small
on the left.

CTA CHEST W/ AND W/O CONTRAST
FINDINGS: The heart and great vessels are unremarkable. There is
no evidence of thoracic aortic dissection or pulmonary embolism.
No pericardial effusion is seen. The lungs are grossly clear,
with only minimal dependent atelectasis and no focal
consolidation (note that the full lung bases are included only
on the low-dose acquisition). No pleural effusion is seen. A few
non- pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes identified.
.
This examination is not tailored for detailed evaluation of
subdiaphragmatic regions. The visualized portions of the liver,
spleen and stomach are grossly unremarkable, with no extreme
upper abdominal ascites.
.
Osseous structures are unremarkable without suspicious lytic or
sclerotic lesion identified. There is suggestion of a rounded 2
cm low-attenuation lesion within the left lobe of the thyroid.
.
IMPRESSION:
1. No a
