CHEST (PA & LAT)  [**2170-2-24**] 9:01 AM

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: eval for pleural effusions

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
62 year old man s/p AVR
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
eval for pleural effusions
EXAMINATION: PA and lateral chest.

INDICATION: Status post AVR. Pleural effusion.

PA and lateral views of the chest are obtained [**2170-2-24**] at 0906
hours and are compared with the prior study performed on [**2170-2-22**]
1310 hours. Patient is status post AVR. Small bilateral pleural
effusions are seen, more marked on the left side and increased
slightly since prior examination. Patchy increase in density is
seen in the right base, likely in the right lower lobe, which
was not present on the prior examination and may represent some
developing airspace disease. The examination is otherwise
unchanged from the prior study.

IMPRESSION:

Slight increase in bilateral pleural effusions, more marked on
the left side. Patchy airspace disease developing in the right
base. Increased retrocardiac density are not significantly
changed since prior examination and likely representing
subsegmental atelectasis.

Findings
LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size. Good (>20 cm/s) LAA ejection
velocity.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is
seen in the RA and extending into the RV. Normal interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size. Low
normal LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Focal calcifications in
aortic root. Moderately dilated ascending aorta. Simple atheroma
in aortic arch. Mildly dilated descending aorta. Simple atheroma
in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Bicuspid aortic valve. Moderately thickened aortic
valve leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA <0.8cm2). Mild to moderate
([**11-22**]+) AR. AR may be underestimated. Eccentric AR jet directed
toward the anterior mitral leaflet.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.
Physiologic (normal) PR.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. Resting bradycardia
for the patient. See Conclusions for post-bypass data The
post-bypass study was performed while the patient was receiving
vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of
medications).
Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are simple atheroma
in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly
dilated. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic
aorta.
5. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is severe aortic valve stenosis
(area <0.8cm2). At least mild to moderate aortic regurgitation
is seen. The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric, directed
toward the anterior mitral leaflet.
6. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral regurgitation.

POST-BYPASS: During the post-bypass study, the patient was
initially AV paced and, later, A paced.
1. A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the aortic
position with normal leaflet motion and gradients (mean gradient
=12 mmHg, peak gradient = 16mmHg with CO 5.1L/min). Trace
valvular aortic regurgitation is seen.
2. Regional and global left ventricular systolic function is
normal.
3. Right ventricular systolic function is normal.
4. Trace Mitral Regurgitation and other valves are as noted
prebypass.
5. Aortic contours are intact post-decannulation.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was taken to the operating room on [**2170-2-21**] where he
underwent an AVR. He was transferred to the ICU in stable
condition. He was extubated later that same day. He was
transferred to the floor on POD #1.  He was seen by speech and
swallow for preoperative dysphagia. Video swallow showed no
aspiraton. He had atrial fibrillation and was started on
amiodarone, his PR interval lengthened and the amio was dc'd. He
did well postoperatively and he was ready for discharge home on
POD #5.
