Brief Hospital Course:
51 y/o female with HCC and ETOH cirrhosis who presents for
orthotopic liver transplant. After confirming consent via
Cambodian interpreter , the patient was taken to the OR by Dr
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 816**] and Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. Per the operative report there
were no complications and the patient tolerated the procedure in
stable condition.
She received routine induction immunosuppression to include
pre-op Cellcept, Intra-op solumedrol. Low dose Prograf was
started on the evening of POD 0 and she continued the solumedrol
to prednisone taper per pathway.
The patient was extubated on POD 1 and was transferred out of
the ICU early in her course.
On POD 2, as physical therapy was working with the patient there
was concern for left upper arm weakness and left deviation when
walking. A stat head CT was obtained
which showed no evidence of acute hemorrhage or obvious large
vascular
territory infarction. This improved over the course of the
hospital stay and she was fully ambulatory without weakness or
gait problems by time of discharge. Her neuro exam revealed only
a mild grip strength difference and no other focal deficit.
JP drains were serous and both were d/c'd prior to discharge.
She does have some bruising along the left lateral portion of
the chevron incision but the incision itself is C/D/I.
The patient was tolerating diet and ambulating and had return of
bowel function by HD 5. She remained afebrile and LFTs which
took a minor bump on POD 4 are now trending back towards normal
with normal alk phos and Bilirubin.
Prograf levels have varied widely and will continue to require
close follow up in the outpatient setting.
