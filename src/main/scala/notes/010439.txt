Brief Hospital Course:
Pt continued to have lightheadedness on ambulation on the
floor.. Triggered on floor for BP to 68 noted at time to be
diaphoretic, grey, with abdominal pain and malaise, bp's
remaining in 80s with IV fluids, PRBCs and trendelenburg with
subsequent triage to MICU.

In the MICU, given FFP, vit K with goal INR 1.5. 3units PRBC w/
increase in HCT to >37.  Had un trending CE's with evoloving
ischemic changes on EKG.  Discussed with family goals of care,
and they along with the patient, decided against cardiac cath
and desired anticoagulation since risk of GIB was less in their
minds compared to risk of stroke from Afib.  Pulmonary edema
worsened on auscultation, pt given small dose of lasix, while
watching UOP.  Transfered back to MACU for patient comfort.
 .
During her MICU stay the following problems were managed:

GI bleed:
Received endoscopy revealing gastritis, mild esophagitis, 2
superficial duodenal erosions. Pt was started on PPI.
Colonoscopy was considered however HCT improved with clinical
improvement thus was not pursued.

Cardiac Ischemia: CE's trended along with EKGs.  ASA given and
coumadin restarted.  Lasix for pulmonary edema.  Pt did not want
cath.

HYPOTENSION: Thought secondary to GIB and hypovolemia.
Pancultured and abx empiric coverage subsequently discontinued
after 48 hours with 3 days.

Constipation: Had prior hx on impaction, with constipation
possible cause of abdominal pain. Started on bowel regimen of
lactulose, mirulax, senna, dulcolace, with subsequent BMs.
Anemia: Likely a chronic anemia exacerbated by acute GIB. Pt
started on.

Renal Failure: Acute on chronic with contribution from
hypotension, with improvement on IV fluids. Medications were
renally dosed and home doses lasix/ACEI held.
Hyperkalemia resolved.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital6 459**] for the Aged - MACU

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary: Upper gastrointestinal bleed
secondary: Cardiac Ischemia



Discharge Condition:
Stable


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted due to hypotension and melena presumed to be
from a bleeding in your stomach or intestine. Your blood thinner
(coumadin) was stopped. Your were given 3 units of packed red
blood cells. Your heart was stressed by this experience and
showed signs of not getting enough oxygen. You declined a
cardiac intervention. You indicated that preventing stroke was
the most important health objective, even if you were to have
another stomach/intestinal bleed. You were restarted on your
coumadin.

Followup Instructions:
MACU with PT/OT.

Follow up with your PCP regarding your hospital course,
especially regarding the on-going cardiac ischemia and your
desires for limited intervention.
