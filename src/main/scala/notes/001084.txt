Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
78 yo F w/ abd pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
right femoral line
right upper extremity PICC
transient levophed


History of Present Illness:
78 yo F w/ h/o hyperchol, IDDM, asthma, and s/p CCY several
years ago who presents from rehab w/ c/o RUQ abd pain x 3 days.
Patient d/c from [**Hospital1 18**] [**2169-4-14**] following a right transmetatarsal
amputation for gangrenous right foot. Patient's admission was
uncomplicated other than a fever spike on POD #1 o/n but CXR
negative and patient defervesced. She required 1 U PRBC
intraoperatively for hct 26.8. Per daughter, patient is somewhat
confused and currently an unreliable historian, thus I relied on
her daughter for hx. Her daughter states that her mom first
started c/o diffuse abdominal pain but particularly subxiphoidal
abdominal pain on Friday. Her mother states that the pain was
occasionally worse w/ eating but her daughter states that her
mom was eating a full liquid diet. She has been vomiting,
however. Occasionally it is the food she just ate and other
times she will vomit up her pills. However, she had soup and
jello this am w/o vomiting. Her mom has also been c/o back pain
but as far as her daughter can tell this is just her chronic
LBP. She doesn't seem to relate the pain to her abdominal pain.
Patient's daughter thinks her mom's last BM was on Friday but
she is really not sure. Per notes, patient spiked temp of 101 at
rehab. Patient's daughter is not aware of any h/o PUD or CAD in
her mother. [**Name (NI) **] mom did have a gall bladder attack severeal
years ago leading to CCY, but o/w no abdominal surgeries/issues.
+ h/o BRBPR. Daughter not sure if she's had a c-scope in the
past. Daughter is not aware of any urinary complaints

On further ROS:
Patient has been having hallucinations which started in the
hospital, attributed to pain medications.

+ SOB which is worse if she lies flat since her last admission
to [**Hospital1 18**]

Per notes, her mother also reported some chest tightness.

Unit admission:
FDP 10-40, fibrinogen 672

CT abd/pelvis [**4-16**]:
1. Mild dilatation of the distal common duct with no
choledocholithiasis, unchanged from the prior ultrasound.
2. Status post cholecystectomy.
3. Likely left renal cyst, although too small to characterize.
4. Sigmoid diverticulosis.
5. Calcified fibroids.
6. Bilateral 2 cm adrenal masses, which cannot be characterized
further on this study.
7. Fluid collection in the left groin, presumably related to
recent
catheterization. 6.0 x 3.0 cm

RUQ U/S [**2169-4-18**]:
IMPRESSION: Diffusely prominent common duct, as described above,
unchanged in appearance from the patient's previous ultrasound
exam of [**2167-6-9**]. This
finding is likely related to the remote history of
cholecystectomy. Otherwise, an unremarkable right upper quadrant
ultrasound.

CXR [**4-16**]:
Right hilar fullness on the AP view without a definite
abnormality
on the lateral view. A repeat good technique AP and lateral may
be performed to see whether this should be further evaluated
with CT.

EKG: sinus at 82 bpm, old QIII, no STTW changes

Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo F w/ h/o hyperchol, ? T2DM, asthma, and h/o PVD s/p
bilateral MTA, most recently on the right ([**2169-4-11**]) who presents
from rehab w/ c/o RUQ abd pain x 3 days.

# Abdominal pain/vomiting
CT abd/pelvis did not show anything that might explain this
patient's presenting complaint. Her LFTs were slightly elevated
on presentation concerning for possible cholestasis postop but
they essentially normalized. Her statin was held
prophylactically. Hepatitis panel was unremarkable, positive for
hep A IgG but negative for hep A IgM. Her h/o vomiting was
concerning for pancreatitis but her lipase/amylase WNL. Given ?
h/o BM, we considered constipation as a cause of her abdominal
pain and tx w/ aggressive bowel regimen. Consideration was made
for a RP bleed or leaking AAA given h/o left groin hematoma
following cath [**3-30**] but her presenting pain was in the RUQ, in
addition to c/o her chronic L4/5 back pain. In addition her hct
remained stable and her CT was unremarkable. Ms. [**Known lastname 1794**] had no
h/o PUD but did report h/o BRBPR years ago so we considered a
possible stress ulcer and tx her accordingly w/ PPI, guiacing
all her stools. There was no lactic acisosis to suggest ischemic
gut and her lytes were WNL. She ultimately ended up being dx w/
urosepsis. Her urine cx showed > 100K colonies/ml of
enterococcus sensitive to amp/levo/vanc. Plan to tx w/ vanc x 10
days (long duration of antibx for concurrent MTA cellulitis).
Patient currently has no further c/o abdominal pain.

# Decreased MS
[**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1795**] on initial presentation given pinpoint pupils,
h/o hallucinations, and being tx w/ dilaudid, MS contin, and
neurontin at rehab. However, her MS [**First Name (Titles) 1796**] [**Last Name (Titles) 1797**] despite
holding pain medications, at which time patient was found to be
hypotensive (70/palp w/ doppler assist). She was transiently
started on pressors, aggressively hydrated, and MS returned to
[**Location 213**] w/in 24 hours. She was thus also dx w/ urosepsis. Of
note, blood cultures were negative for any growth.
Folate/B12/TSH/RPR were all unremarkable. CXR was w/o
infiltrate.

# Fever/leukocytosis
Patient ultimately dx
