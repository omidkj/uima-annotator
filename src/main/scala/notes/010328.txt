PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Temperature was 37.1,
his heart rate was 105, his blood pressure was 110/70,
saturating 100% (intubated), and his weight was 165 pounds.
In general, the patient was intubated and sedated.  No
apparent craniofacial trauma.  The pupils were appropriately
reactive to light.  The tympanic membranes were clear.  The
trachea was midline.  The lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heart was regular in rate and rhythm.  The
abdomen was nondistended.  There was an apparent entry wound
2 cm superior to the right of the umbilicus.  The apparent
exit wound was in the right lower back.  Distal pulses were
2+ bilaterally.  There was no extremity deformity.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 10.6, his hematocrit was 39.7, and his
platelets were 131.  Coagulations revealed prothrombin time
was 13.4, his partial thromboplastin time was 25.2, and his
INR was 1.2.  Fibrinogen was 117.  Amylase was 56.  P&P were
within normal limits.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient is a
25-year-old gentleman who was transferred from an outside
hospital after being involved in an altercation during which
he suffered a gunshot wound to his abdomen.

Upon transfer to [**Hospital1 69**], the
patient was immediately taken to the operating room for
exploration.  His entrance wound had been in his right upper
quadrant, through and through injury to the gallbladder,
large bowel, with the exit wound in his right lower back.
Stool and bile leakage were seen.

The patient underwent a cholecystectomy, a segmental colon
resection, and his entrance and exit wounds were left open.
For further details, please refer to the Operative Note.

Immediately postoperatively, the patient remained stable.  He
was initially monitored closely in the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient received some fresh frozen plasma for a high INR
and some cryoprecipitate for a low fibrinogen.  The patient
was eventually weaned to extubation.  He was placed on
antibiotics for appropriate antimicrobial coverage.

The patient's cervical spine was imaged and cleared.  The
patient's wound continued to remain clean without any signs
of infection.  The patient was placed on Pepcid and
subcutaneous heparin for appropriate prophylaxis.  Of note,
Psychiatry was consulted for education after surgery.  Their
recommendations were the continuation of Ativan as needed per
CIWA-AR scales.

The patient was transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit on
postoperative day two.  He continued to have stable
hematocrit levels.  The patient was started on a short course
of total parenteral nutrition to improve nutritional support.
The patient spiked a fever, for which he was cultured.
Incentive spirometry and ambulation were encouraged at this
point.  The fever resolved without any further intervention.

The nasogastric tube was removed on postoperative day four,
which he tolerated.  His diet was slowly advanced, and his
total parenteral nutrition was weaned off.  The patient was
switched over to a by mouth pain control regimen which was
adequate.

The patient's staples were removed on postoperative day six,
and the wound continued to heal well.  It was thought that
the patient was stable for discharge on postoperative day six
with followup in the Trauma Clinic the following week.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post gunshot wound with exploratory laparotomy,
segmental colon resection with stapled anastomosis, status
post cholecystectomy.
2.  Asthma.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Percocet one to two tablets by mouth q.4-6h. as needed
(for pain).
2.  Metronidazole 500-mg tablets one tablet by mouth q.8h.
(for seven days).
3.  Keflex 500-mg tablets one tablet by mouth q.8h. (for
seven days).

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was instructed to call the Trauma Clinic to
schedule an appointment in one week.
2.  The patient was instructed to avoid heavy lifting (no
strenuous activity), to monitor the wound for any signs of
infection.
