Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to CCu from Ed with STEMI likely due to
proximal RCA lesion.  Patient's family was very clear that they
did not want aggressive intervention (ie, No cath) and wanted
the emphasis to be on comfort measures only; they confirmed that
the patient was DNR/DNI. The family declined heparin or other
medical intervention.

Upon arrival to the CCU the patient was noted to be hypotensive
with bradycardia and agonal breathing.  She was started on a
morphine drip.  She passed away within 2 hours with her
daughters at her bedside.
