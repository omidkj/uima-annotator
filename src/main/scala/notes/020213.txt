HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 62-year-old male
with past medical history of sigmoid diverticulitis, coronary
artery disease, status post myocardial infarction, congestive
heart failure, hypertension, and gastroesophageal reflux
disease, who was transferred from [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital.  Patient
complained of fever, right upper quadrant malaise, and
decreased appetite for two weeks prior to admission.  Patient
was admitted to the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital, and was found to have
a large mass in the right hepatic lobe consistent with
hepatic abscess by CT scan.  The patient became septic and
was transferred to [**Hospital1 69**] and
Medical Intensive Care Unit on [**5-26**] while on dopamine drip.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON TIME OF ADMISSION:  Heart rate 60-70s, blood
pressure 88-98/50 on dopamine 3 mcg/kg/minute, respiratory
rate was [**11-29**] with O2 saturation of 95% on room air.  The
patient was alert and oriented times three.  Cardiac
examination was not significant.  Lungs had decreased breath
sounds bilaterally consistent with bilateral pleural
effusions.  Abdomen was distended.  Bowel sounds present.
Foley was in place.

On admission, white count was 18.8 with 90% neutrophils, H&H
was 9.3/27.1, platelets 175.  Chemistries were within normal
limits.  AST and ALT were elevated at 111 and 291
respectively.  Alkaline phosphatase was 446, but amylase and
lipase were within normal limits.  Cardiac enzymes were
normal.

Electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at 75.

During the MICU stay, the patient developed intermittent
fever and chills, and was started on intravenous Zosyn.  The
patient was transferred to Surgical Intensive Care Unit under
Dr.[**Name (NI) 670**] care on hospital day three and continued on IV
Zosyn.  Patient underwent CT-guided percutaneous drainage of
right hepatic abscess on hospital day six without any
complications.  The patient had a pigtail catheter left in
the abscess site for further drainage.  Drains ultimately
grew back E. coli without antibiotic resistance.  The patient
also received a PICC line for IV antibiotic therapy on
hospital day six.  The patient was also found to have a
pelvic abscess, a likely complication from prior
diverticulitis which was also the cause of this hepatic
abscesses.

The patient remained afebrile, and was transferred to the
floor.  On hospital day nine, the patient underwent
additional ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage of
remaining multiple small hepatic abscesses draining a total
of 20 cc of pus.  The patient did not have any complications.
Sites of percutaneous drainage were nontender on discharge,
but there was minimal drainage from the pigtail catheter.
