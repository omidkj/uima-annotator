Brief Hospital Course:
She was noted to have CO2 retention and was started on BiPAP.
She then became hypotensive and required dopamine gtt. She went
into hypercarbic respiratory failure and was intubated in the
MICU. The pt was continued on her home medication. Her
respiratory failure was thought to be likely secondary to RSV
infection from her daughter superimposed on underlying
OSA/obesity-hypoventilation/ restrictive lung disease and CHF.
She was covered empirically with CTX/azithromycin for CAP, as a
possible RML infiltrate on CXR/CT [**2-3**] suggested bacterial
superinfection. Also it was thought that her ASD was aggravated
by the worsening lung function and respectively worsened her
lung status again. She was given stress dose steroids:
hydrocortisone Na Succ 100 mg IV Q8h, which was discontinued on
the [**2-5**]. The CXR also was significant for mild congestive
heart failure which was resolved on the CXR from [**2118-2-5**]. A CTA
was done and did not show any evidence of pulmonary emboli, but
was positive for atelectasis within both lower lobes and right
middle lobe. An ECHO done on admission was significant for
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and moderate
([**1-31**]+) mitral regurgitation with normal EF. CE were negative.
The pt was extubated on the [**2-4**] and was tolerating it well.
She was continued on BIPAP overnight for her OSA. Her
hypotension was resolved with a total of 5L fluids only. The
ARF, which was attributed to fluid depletion, resolved and
creatinine was back to baseline. The pt was found to have
expiratory wheezing on exam on arrival to the floor. It was
unclear whether those were due to fluid overload suggested on an
CXR from the [**2-7**] or whether there is a bronchoconstricitve
component involved. She was started on Prednisone 60mg with the
plan for a long term taper and was, at the same time, diuresed,
with the goal for 1 L negative over the next two days.
Furosemide was restarted at outpatient dose as well as
Lisinopril. The pt improved with therapy over the next two days
and was able to maintain O2 saturation around 92 on 2L with rest
and in the 80ies on 2L with ambulation. The pt's leukocytosis
resolved and she remained afebrile. Azithromycin was
discontinued after a five day course. Lisinopril was tritrated
up to 20mg over the next days as the pt remained hypertensive.
The pt was also found to be anemic and guaiac positive. Baseline
hct 35-36. Vit B12, folate wnl. Mildy decreased plt count,
elevated WBC, but no atypicals. Iron studies c/w FeSO4
deficiency > started on Ferrous sulfate. Guaiac stool positive
but no grossly bloody or dark stool. Pt will need elective
colonoscopy as an outpatient.
For the pt's hypothyroidism synthroid was continued at home
dose. Normal TSH.
