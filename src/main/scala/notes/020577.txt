Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2120-9-2**] Aortic valve replacement (#19mm pericardial)/septal

History of Present Illness:
69 year old female with a longstanding history of a heart murmur
and aortic stenosis followed by serial echocardiograms. An
echocardiogram in [**2120-4-7**] showed severe aortic stenosis with
a peak gradient of 112mmHg across the valve as well as moderate
regurgitation. She does note some dyspnea on exertion however
she continues to particpate in [**Last Name (un) 91633**] and weight lifting. Given
the severity and progression of her disease, she is now referred
for surgical consultation.

Pertinent Results:
[**2120-9-2**] Echo: PRE-BYPASS: The left atrium is normal in size. No
spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the
left atrium or left atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the body of the right atrium. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). There is prominent septal hypertrophy extending into
the LVOT. C-[**Month (only) **] distance is 1.66 with [**Doctor Last Name **]/PL ratio 1.36. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta, aortic
arch, and in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve is
bicuspid. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
thickened/deformed. There is critical aortic valve stenosis
(valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The aortic regurgitation jet is eccentric. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen. There is no pericardial effusion. POST-BYPASS: There is a
well seated #19 prosthetic valve in the aortic position. There
is no evidence of a peri-valvular leak. Mean gradient is 16mm
Hg. There is no evidence of aortic dissection. There is
preserved left ventricular systolic function that is unchanged
from prebypass
.
[**2120-9-5**] CXR: PA and lateral chest views were obtained with
patient in upright position. Comparison is made with the next
preceding portable AP single view chest examination of [**9-4**]. Status post sternotomy and significant postoperative cardiac
enlargement as before. Pulmonary congestive pattern; however,
has decreased and there is no evidence of acute pulmonary
infiltrates. Still, the diaphragms are concealed by bilateral
pleural effusions that blunt the lateral and posterior pleural
sinuses. Also identified on the lateral view are the metallic
components of a porcine aortic valve prosthesis in place and
multiple surgical clips in the left anterior mediastinum related
to the previous bypass surgery. A right internal jugular
approach central venous line remains in place and terminates
overlying the SVC at the level 2 cm below the carina. Comparison
is also made with the preoperative chest examination of [**8-27**], [**2120**]. The pleural spaces were free and the now existing
pleural effusions are considered to be of moderate degree. No
pneumothorax is seen in the apical area.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2120-9-2**] where
the patient underwent an aortic valve replacement(#19mm
pericardial)/septal myomectomy. Please see operative note for
surgical details. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the cardiovascular
intensive care unit in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring. Post operative day one found the patient
extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably. The
patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically stable,
weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support. Beta blocker was
initiated and the patient was gently diuresed toward the
preoperative weight. The patient was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further recovery. Chest tubes and pacing
wires were discontinued without complication. The patient was
evaluated by the physical therapy service for assistance with
strength and mobility. On post-op day 4 she had an episode of
atrial fibrillation and was given beta-blocker and amiodarone
with good response. By the time of discharge on POD 5 the
patient was ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain
was controlled with oral analgesics. The patient was discharged
home with VNA services in good condition with appropriate follow
up instructions.
