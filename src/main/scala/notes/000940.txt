Bright Red Blood per rectum

History of Present Illness:
70 yo female with myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic renal
insufficiency secondary to cyclosporine, extensive GI bleeding
over the past several years, presenting with multiple episodes
of BRBPR starting on the morning of admission. Pt was initially
admitted to the OMED service with a hct drop of 4 points and was
transfused 2U PRBC and 3U pf HLA matched platelets for a
platelet count of 14. She was also given DDAVP for presumed
dysfunctional platelets. She was hemodynamically stable. Last
night she was also found to be febrile and was started on
Cefepime and Flagyl and then changed over to Zosyn as she
complained of severe nausea on Flagyl.
This am the patient developed worsening BRBPR and again had one
bloody stool with associated abdominal pain as well as
hypotension with a systolic BP of 90 and tachycardia. She was
transfused another 3U PRBC and her BP and HR normalized again.
The patient then went to nuclear medicine and subsequently was
transferred to the ICU for closer monitoring.
.
ROS: negative for lightheadedness, chest pain, palpitations,
SOB, dysuria or altered mental status. She reports fatigue, mild
cramping abdominal pain, and increased number of echymoses
across her abdomen, arms, and legs.

Imaging:
CXR: Single AP view of the chest reveals the tip of a port line
in the SVC in satisfactory position.  The mediastinum is
midline.  There is peribronchial thickening and increased
markings in both lung bases without gross consolidation however
early pneumonitis in the left lower lobe cannot be excluded.
.
Nuclear bleeding scan: negative per oral report

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: progression of opacities, likely PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1064**]

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
70 year old woman with myelodysplastic syndrome, with fever and
neutropenia, with decreased o2 sats and SOB.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
progression of opacities, likely PCP pneumonia
HISTORY: Fever. Shortness of breath.

Single portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates similar
cardiomediastinal contour to that seen on [**2138-10-15**]. Right-sided
Port-A-Cath remains unchanged. Increased opacity involving the
bilateral lungs remains similar in appearance. There is very
mild blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles. Trachea is
midline.

IMPRESSION:

No interval change.

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST  [**2138-9-28**] 3:47 PM

CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST

Reason: please evaluate for infiltrates

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
70 year old woman with MDS fevers, acute hypoxia
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please evaluate for infiltrates
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

STUDY: CT of the chest without contrast.

INDICATION: 70-year-old female with history of myelodysplastic
syndrome presenting with fevers, acute hypoxia. Assess for
infiltrates.

COMPARISONS: [**2138-9-24**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of the lungs are acquired. Coronal
and sagittal reformatted images were then obtained.

CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are several,
subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes. No pathologically
enlarged axillary or hilar lymph nodes are present. A small
pericardial effusion is relatively unchanged in size compared to
the examination four days prior. A moderate- to large-sized
hiatal hernia is also again noted.

Lung windows demonstrate dramatic interval change with diffuse,
ground-glass opacities present throughout both lungs, mostly new
compared to the previous examination. A few pulmonary nodules
within the right lung are again noted and unchanged compared to
the previous examination. Incidental note is also made of
bibasilar atelectasis.

No lytic or blastic lesions within the osseous structures are
noted. Limited views of the upper abdomen are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Multifocal air-space process throughout both lungs
dramatically new compared to examination from four days prior.
Given the non-pathologic but prominent mediastinal
lymphadenopathy, infectious etiologies including atypical
infections if the patient is immunocompromised should be
considered. ARDS given the timing of these findings is also a
diagnostic consideration. Clinical correlation is advised. No
pleural effusion.

Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 4:55 pm by Dr.
[**First Name (STitle) 7747**] over the telephone on [**2138-9-28**].

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 70 y.o. woman with myelodysplastic syndrome and resultant
pancytopenia and recurrent GIB associated with ulcerations in
her small intestine.
.
# GI Bleeding: Likely due from previously discovered small
intestinal ulcerations, with increased propensity for bleeding
given thrombocytopenia. No evidence of UGIB. Baseline h
