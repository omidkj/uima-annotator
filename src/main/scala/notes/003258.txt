Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2117-9-29**] Aortic valve replacement with a 29-mm [**Company 1543**] Mosaic
Ultra bioprosthesis. Replacement of ascending aorta with a 30-mm
Dacron tube graft using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest
which included hemi-arch replacement.

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old male known to our service (see previous notes) who
has a history of severe AS ([**Location (un) 109**] 0.8cm2), HTN, chronic GI
bleeding ([**1-6**] AVMs, UC) requiring frequent transfusion,
myelodysplastic syndrome s/p recent chemotherapy. He has been
undergoing work-up for potential aortic valve replacement and
asc. aorta repl. He first needed neuro clearance after new left
foot drop. Neuro decided foot drop is related to peroneal nerve
lesion. Given his complex GI history, he was also waiting GI
clearance and to make sure that his colitis was in control and
hopefully off steroids. Following cardiac surgery, it was
recommended that he have a colectomy because of the ulcerative
colitis and a large polyp that is almost to the anal verge.
There are multiple other polyps that are also adenomas. He now
presents again in clinic for further discussion of surgery.

Past Medical History:
- Severe aortic stenosis
- Hypertension
- Hyperlipidemia
- Systolic congestive heart failure
- Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy
- Ulcerative colitis with recurrent GI bleeding on sulfasalazine

- Gastric AVMs s/p GI bleed, admitted on [**2117-7-26**] to [**2117-7-28**]
- Myelodysplastic syndrome, tx with Vidaza [**Date range (1) 32684**]
- Prostate Cancer in [**2095**]'s
- Left foot drop - common peroneal nerve lesion, likely at the
fibular head. Wears foot orthosis and foot drop splint.
- s/p b/l cataract extraction and lens implants

Pertinent Results:
Echo [**2117-9-29**]: PRE-BYPASS: No spontaneous echo contrast or
thrombus is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is
seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). Doppler parameters are most
consistent with Grade II (moderate) left ventricular diastolic
dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta is
mildly dilated. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the
descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve
stenosis (valve area 0.8-1.0cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] was notified in person of the
results at time of surgery.
POST-BYPASS: The patient is AV paced. The patient is on no
inotropes. Biventricular function is unchanged. There is a
well-seated, well-functioning bioprosthetic valve in the aortic
position. No aortic regurgitation is seen. No paravalvular leak
is seen. There is a mean gradient of 7 mmHg across the aortic
valve at a cardiac index of 2.1. Mitral regurgitation is trace.
Tricuspid regurgitation is unchanged. The aorta is intact.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 14218**] was a same day admit after undergoing pre-operative
work-up prior to admission. On [**2117-9-29**] he was brought to the
operating room where he underwent an aortic valve replacement
and ascending aorta replacement. Please see operative report for
surgical details. Overall the patient tolerated the procedure
well and post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring. POD 2 the
patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing comfortably.
The patient was neurologically intact and hemodynamically
stable, weaned from inotropic and vasopressor support.  He was
seen by speech and swallow for a bedside evaluation and was
cleared for a regular diet. His rhythym was initially asystole
and then became nodal and eventually he was in a sinus rhythm in
the 60's. EP service was consulted. Low dose beta blocker was
initiated and titrated up and the patient tolerated this well.
He was gently diuresed toward his preoperative weight. The
patient was transferred to the telemetry floor for further
recovery. Chest tubes and pacing wires were discontinued
(patient was in sinus rhythm in the 80's) after third dose of
beta blocker without complication.  The patient was evaluated by
the physical therapy service for assistance with strength and
mobility. By the time of discharge on POD 6 the patient was
ambulating with assistance, the wound was healing and pain was
controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged to
[**Hospital 88006**] [**Hospital **]  Rehab in [**Location (un) 38**] in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
