[**2142-10-6**] 06:50AM BLOOD TSH-2.1
[**2142-10-6**] ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. There
is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %).
Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular
filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**2-13**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve leaflets are
thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
[**2142-10-8**] Abdominal Ultrasound: The liver shows no focal or
textural abnormalities. There is no biliary dilatation and the
common duct measures .5 cm. The portal vein is patent with
hepatopetal flow. The gallbladder is normal without evidence of
stones. The pancreas and spleen are unremarkable and the spleen
measures 10.7 cm. The aorta is ectatic with eccentric mural
thrombus but no AAA is identified. The widest measurement of the
infrarenal aorta is 2.8 x 2.5 cm. There is no evidence of
ascites. Noted on this exam is a large right pleural effusion.
[**2142-10-8**] Cardiac Cath: 1.  Coronary angiography in this left
dominant system demonstrated 2 vessel disease.  The LMCA had
mild disease.  The LAD had a 40% proximal occlusion and was
occluded after D1.  The LCx had a 90% proximal occlusion with an
occluded OM.  The RCA was occluded proximally with collaterals
to the LAD from a conus branch. 2.  Resting hemodynamics
revealed slightly elevated filling pressures with RVEDP of 10
mmHg and LVEDP of 23 mmHg.  There was mild pulmonary arterial
systolic hypertension with PASP of 33 mmHg.  The cardiac index
was preserved at 2.7 L/min/m2.  There was mild systemic arterial
systolic hypertension with an SBP 144 mmHg and a DBP of 68 mmHg.
3.  Lower extremity angiography revealed patent iliac arteries,
a patent right renal artery and severe left renal artery
stenosis.
[**2142-10-9**] Renal Ultrasound: The right and left kidneys measure
9.3 and 10.5 cm respectively. There is no hydronephrosis,
cortical thinning, shadowing stones, or masses. The bladder
appears normal. Both ureteral jets were demonstrated.
[**2142-10-9**] CArotid Ultrasound: There is less than 40% stenosis
within bilateral internal carotid arteries.


Brief Hospital Course:
He was admitted to cardiology with new onset heart failure after
ruling in for a non ST elevation myocardial infarction. He was
initially maintained on intravenous Nitro and started on beta
blockade and diuretics. He was also started on antibiotics for a
suspected community acquired pneumonia. An echocardiogram was
notable for mild global left ventricular systolic dysfunction
(EF 45-50%) with elevated left ventricular filling pressures. It
also revealed mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, mild
pulmonary hypertension, and a mildly dilated ascending aorta -
see result section.  Subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed
severe two vessel coronary artery disease, and severe left renal
artery stenosis. Based upon the above, cardiac surgery was
consulted and further preoperative evaluation was performed -
please see result section. He remained stable on intravenous
therapy and was eventually cleared for surgery. On [**10-12**],
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] performed coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.
Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated without incident. He maintained stable hemodynamics
and transferred to the SDU on postoperative day one. He remained
in a normal sinus rhythm. Over several days, beta blockade was
advanced as tolerated and he continued to make clinical
improvements with diuresis. An ACE inhibitor was eventually
started for hypertension. Once medical therapy was optimized, he
was eventually cleared for discharge to home on postoperative
day six.
