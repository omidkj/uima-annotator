History of Present Illness:
     85 year old man with CAD s/p CABG and CHF who was admitted
with recurrent epistaxis. He was transferred to the MICU for
hypotension. He first had epistaxis one week ago and went to [**Hospital **]
clinic on [**7-24**] where he was cauterized. Five days later, he
presented to [**Hospital1 18**] ENT on [**7-29**] for recurrent epistaxis and was
packed by ENT consult. Two nights ago, he presented to the ED
again for epistaxis and was cautarized. He has not bled since.
In the ED, his vitals were 96.8, HR: 46, BP:167/74, RR:20, O2
95%RA.

He was kept overnight in the ED then admitted to the Medicine
team in the morning. He recieved all his BP meds including
metoprolol, lisinopril, lasix and imdur. At the time, he was
also straining to move his bowels. His SBP dropped from 120's to
80's over the course of the morning. His vitals were: 96.5,
88/40, 50, 94%RA. He remained asymptomatic; making urine,
ambulating and mentating. He recieved 650cc's of NS without
improvement, and given his h/o CHF, he was then transferred to
the MICU for closer monitoring and care. In the MICU the pt
received an additional 1L NS in boluses and 1L NS over 10 hrs
with improvement in his SBPs to the 120-140s. This am, he had an
episode of L sided chest pressure without SOB, diaphoresis, n/v,
lightheadedness, palpitations. Stated this was his anginal
equivalent which occurs 1-2xs/week. EKG was without any new
ischemic changes and pain relieved with SL nitro. Was transfused
2 units pRBC for Hct 23.9 which bumped to 28.7. Transferred to
