Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted from outside hospital on [**2154-3-24**]
Taken to cath lab on [**3-25**], found to have 90% LM & 2vCAD.  IABP
placed, taken to the CCU.  Went to the OR on [**2154-3-27**] for CABG X
4 (SVG>LAD, SVG>ramus>diag, SVG>PDA), Maze, LAA ligation,
(please see operative note for details).  Post-operatively taken
to CSRU, on neo-synephrine for BP.  Was slow to wean from
ventilator, due to sedation, and pulm. secretions.  She had some
sinus rhythm post-op, but went back into AFib, with occasional
rapid ventricular rates.  EP service was consulted, amiodarone
was started.
ID was consulted due to elevated WBC, empiric antibiotics were
started, but cultures were all essentially negative.  She
remained on levofloxacin until [**2154-4-11**].
Hematology service was following her due to a new pre-operative
diagnosis of lymphoma, which ultimately was diagnosed as chronic
myelomonocytic leukemia, which will require frequent
transfusions of blood products.
She was extubated on POD # 8, but subsequently suffered a
respiratory arrest requiring brief CPR, and emergent
re-intubation.
She was taken to the OR on [**4-4**] whre she underwent tracheostomy
and PEG placement.
On [**4-8**], she dislodged her trach tube, requiring emergent
intubation, bronchoscopy, and replacement of the tracheostomy
tube.
She had a PICC line placed today for continued IV access and
possible transfusion of blood products.
She has remained hemodynamically stable and is ready to be
transferred to rehab for weaning from the ventilator.
