Date of Birth:  [**2054-6-13**]             Sex:   F

Service: NEUROLOGY

Allergies:
Codeine / Lipitor

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 13017**]
Chief Complaint:
Pneumonia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Patient seen and examined, agree with house officer admission
note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] with additions below.

66 year old Female with diabetes, CVA, and ESRD on HD M/W/F who
presented to ED from hemodialysis after developing fever and
chills. History is difficult to obtain, as the patient is
minimally conversive at baseline, but was not noted to have any
coughing, vomiting, or diarrhea per report.

In the ED, initial VS were 100.2 85 [**Telephone/Fax (2) 64431**]% RA. On exam,
she was noted to have a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status, and was
oriented only to self. At times, she was not responsive to
verbal stimuli and had increased oral secretions. She also was
noted to have diminished breath sounds bilaterally, though this
was felt to be secondary to poor inspiratory effort. Labs
notable for WBC 6.1 with 78.7% neutrophils and no bands. UA not
suggestive of infection.A chest x-ray was performed which was
concerning for RLL PNA. Vancomycin and ceftriaxone were started,
and she was admitted to Medicine for treatment of HCAP. Transfer
VS were 99.3 83 18 100% 2L NC.

On the floor, the patient is oriented only to person. She is
unable to answer most questions and is not cooperative with
exam. Of note, she was recently admitted [**Date range (1) 64432**] with lethargy
and abdominal pain. She had a waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] mental status
during the admission, felt to be multifactorial in nature
secondary to hypoglycemia, exacerbation of previous stroke/neuro
deficits, and possible UTI (though culture only positive for
mixed flora). She did not have any other infectious sources
identified. CT head during that admission did not show any acute
process, and EEG suggested a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy
(possibly secondary to her underlying ESRD). Seizure was felt to
be unlikely. Per notes, she was alert but still dioriented at
time of discharge.

CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2120-7-8**]
IMPRESSION:
1.  New right lower lobe opacity worrisome for pneumonia in the
appropriate setting, although other etiologies such as
atelectasis associated with a small pleural effusion could
explain the finding.
2.  Widespread mild interstitial abnormality with new pleural
effusion and thickened fissures, suggesting vascular congestion.

EEG [**2120-7-12**]
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
He background appeared very slow and encephalopathic throughout,
but with additional higher voltage slowing on the left side.
After the first hour or so, there was nearly continuous slowing
mixed with 1.5-2 Hz generalized sharp and slow activity, without
clinical signs of seizure on video. The record is difficult for
making the distinction between severe encephalopathy and
seizure, but the somewhat rhythmic, nearly 2 Hz sharp and slow
activity suggests strongly the possibility of nonconvulsive
seizure activity.

EEG [**2120-7-13**]
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
This is a
markedly abnormal video EEG telemetry with no normal waking or
sleep activity seen. Background rhythms at best demonstrated a
moderated to severe encephalopathy. There continues to be
interspersed periods of time with 1.5-2 Hz sharp and slow wave
generalized activity concerning for periods of NCSE as well as
more focal left hemisphere sharp and slow discharges at 2 Hz for
variable lengths of time during recording. No clinical correlate
was observed during these periods with persistent epileptiform
activity.

EEG [**2120-7-20**]
MPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
This is a
markedly abnormal video EEG telemetry with no normal waking or
sleep activity seen. Background rhythms at best demonstrated a
moderate to severe
encephalopathy. There continues to be interspersed periods of
time with
1.5-2 Hz sharp and slow wave generalized activity as well as
more focal left frontotemporal and right central epileptiform
activity in prolonged runs. No significant change from prior
days' recording.

CT head [**2120-7-10**]
Hypodensity in the left parietal lobe adjacent to the posterior
lateral
ventricle which was not seen on prior exam, unclear if this is
due to
differences in slice selection versus new hypodensity.  If
clinical suspicion for ischemia is high, could consider an MRI
for better evaluation.

CT head [**2120-7-22**]
Increased extent of cytotoxic edema in the left parietal lobe
since [**2120-7-10**] suggests an evolving infarct. No significant
mass effect.  No hemorrhagic transformation.  MRI could be
useful for further evaluation, if not contraindicated.

Bilateral carotid US
Less than 40% stenosis, bilateral internal carotid arteries
