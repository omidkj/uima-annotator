[**2131-5-10**] MRI T & L-SPINE W/ & W/O CONTRAST: IMPRESSION: Limited
examination secondary to motion artifacts, vertebral mass lesion
identified at T7, T8 and T9 levels, possibly consistent with
metastatic disease, versus an over-imposed infectious process
with discitis, additionally, there is also spinal cord
compression and with edema at T9 level. Compression fracture
identified a T11, T12, L1, L2 and L4 levels. Multilevel disc
degenerative disease in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar
spine as described above.
