HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 87-year-old male with
known three-vessel coronary artery disease who presented to
an outside hospital after developing chest pain after eating
dinner.  The patient describes his chest pain as mild
discomfort across his chest involving his posterior left arm.
The girlfriend whom he lives with is a retired head nurse [**First Name (Titles) 1023**]
[**Last Name (Titles) 8757**] the patient to go to the hospital for further
evaluation.

EKG changes:  The outside hospital noted ST elevations in 2,
3, aVF.  The patient was started on heparin and Integrilin
and was given two aspirin on the way to hospital by EMS as
well as two nitroglycerin.  The patient was chest pain free
at the outside hospital emergency department.  He was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further cardiac evaluation via
urgent cardiac catheterization.  Patient denies history of
high cholesterol, high blood pressure, dyspnea on exertion,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea or lower extremity
edema.  Of note, the patient's discharge report from the
outside hospital did note the patient has had a past medical
history of hypercholesterolemia and hypertension.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Nonsmoker, nondrinker, no IV drug use.  The
patient lives in [**Hospital1 **] with his long-term partner.  The
patient still actively is building boats.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for early coronary artery disease.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
1. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  Patient afebrile, heart
rate 60, blood pressure 152/67, respiratory rate 17, oxygen
saturation 98 percent on 2 liters nasal cannula.  In general,
he appeared comfortable in no apparent distress.  Lung
examination:  He had crackles at the right base, increased AP
diameter, and prolonged expiratory phase.  Cardiovascular:
Regular rate and rhythm.  S1, S2 appeared normal.  He had
muffled heart sounds.  He had a [**2-26**] holosystolic murmur at
the apex radiating to the axilla.  His abdomen was soft.
Active bowel sounds. No pulsatile masses.  It was nontender,
nondistended.  His groin on the right side was dry with the
pressure bandage in place.  No bleeding reported.
Extremities:  2 plus equal bilaterally radial pulses.
Dorsalis pedis pulses 1 plus bilaterally.  Decreased hair
over his lower extremities plus chronic venostasis changes on
his lower extremities to mid calf.  Neurological examination:
Alert and oriented x 3 with appropriate mental status.  His
cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact.

EKG with normal sinus rhythm; slight bradycardia at 58; first-
degree AV block; ST elevations in 2, 3, aVF which are 2 mm; Q-
wave inversions in 1, aVL, V3 through V6.  Repeat EKG post
catheterization showed normal sinus rhythm; bradycardia at
54; prolonged PR of 0.38 milliseconds; the first-degree AV
block; and decreased ST elevations in 2, 3, and aVF now only
1.5 mm with resolution of T-wave inversions in 1 as well as
the lateral leads.  Echocardiogram from [**8-23**] showed an
ejection fraction of 35 percent.  His cardiac
catheterization, the day of admission showed 99 percent mid
LAD, 70 percent E1, 100 percent left circumflex with good
right to left collaterals, 70 percent proximal RCA and 100
percent PDA.

LABORATORY DATA:  Laboratories on admission were notable for
CPK of 45 and a troponin 1 of less than 0.01.  These were
both from the outside hospital.  His chem 7 was sodium 139,
potassium 4.1, chloride 104, bicarbonate 27, BUN 40,
creatinine 2.6, and glucose of 149.  CBC, white count of
10.4, hematocrit of 39.4, and platelets at 242.

BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 87-year-old male with
known history of three-vessel coronary artery disease now
presenting with ST elevations without intervenable culprit
lesion identified on cardiac catheterization but rather
diffusely worsening three-vessel coronary artery disease
treated with Integrilin and heparin.
Coronary artery disease:  This patient's cardiac enzymes
turned it up with a peak CK of 213 and a peak troponin of
0.56.  The patient was continued on Lovenox for 48 hours post
myocardial infarction.  The patient had previously been
treated with Plavix.  Therefore, the patient was not
continued on Integrilin post cardiac catheterization.  The
patient remained chest pain free throughout his hospital
stay.  The patient was monitored on telemetry for any
arrhythmias in the setting of recent myocardial infarction.
There were no arrhythmias noted on telemetry during his
hospital stay.  The patient was treated with Lopressor 25 mg
p.o.  b.i.d. while the patient was in-house.  He was
transitioned back to his atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d. prior to
discharge.  The patient will be continued on aspirin, Plavix,
and atenolol as well as Lipitor on discharge.


Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  The patient was noted
to be wheezy on physical examination and multiple effusions
during his hospital stay.  Patient reports that he takes
albuterol nebulizers at home.  The patient was [**Month/Year (2) 8757**]
that he should avoid albuterol in the setting of recent
myocardial infarctions for at least 4 weeks.  He was
initiated on ipratropium nebulizers p.r.n. in the hospital.
He was also started on Flovent inhaler b.i.d. as well as
ipratropium inhaler b.i.d. with spacer device.  He should
continue these medications on discharge.  He should follow up
with his primary care physician for [**Name Initial (PRE) **] followup of his COPD on
discharge.
1. Dementia:  The patient was noted to have memory deficits
   regarding his medications as well as his home living
   environment, and treatment he received during his hospital
   stay.  He was evaluated by Occupational Therapy for
   cognitive evaluation.  It appeared that he does have some
   chronic cognitive issues given that his partner did not
   feel that he had any changes in his mental status.  The
   patient will have a home occupational therapy evaluation
   on discharge.


DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with services.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable, no arrhythmias noted on
telemetry.  No further episodes of chest pain or shortness of
breath.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  ST elevation myocardial infarction.


Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.


Dementia unspecified.


Status post renal cell carcinoma, status post right
nephrectomy.


Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Lipitor 40 mg orally p.o. q.d.
3. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.  The patient is advised he should
   not stop his medication without talking to a cardiologist
   first.
4. Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Atenolol 25 p.o. q.d.
6. Ipratropium nebulizer q.6h. p.r.n.
7. Ipratropium inhaler q.i.d. p.r.n.
8. Fluticasone 2 puffs b.i.d.

Patient should follow up with his primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].
[**Last Name (STitle) 55474**] for followup of his chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and to check his LFTs 1 month after discharge.  In
addition, he should contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8421**] on Tuesday following
discharge for an appointment within the week following
discharge.  His partner agreed to make the phone call.  She
had already spoken with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8421**] prior to discharge.
