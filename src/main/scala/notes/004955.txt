Pertinent Results:
Radiology Report CHEST (PA & LAT) Study Date of [**2151-1-5**] 9:16 AM

Final Report
INDICATION: 68-year-old male patient status post bypass surgery.
Evaluate
for effusion.
FINDINGS: PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient
in upright
position. Comparison is made with the preceding preoperative
chest
examination of [**2150-12-28**]. The patient is now status post
sternotomy
and the heart shadow is moderately enlarged in comparison with
the
preoperative examination. Appearance of thoracic aorta
unchanged. The on
next previous portable examination remaining pleural densities
on the left
base have further regressed. Crowded vascularity in the left
lower lobe
posterior segment suggests partial atelectasis but no new
parenchymal
infiltrates are seen. The pleural density on the left base
extends into the posterior pleural sinus with only small
detectable blunting. No new pulmonary abnormalities are
identified and no pulmonary vascular congestion is present.
IMPRESSION: Satisfactory postoperative findings status post
bypass surgery.

Conclusions
PRE-CPB:1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage.
2. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
3. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferoapical and
anteroapical hypokinesis.
4. . Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
5. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
6. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
7. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
8. There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results.
POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. AV pacing initially for
slow ventricular response. Preserved biventricular systolic
function post-cpb. LVEF = 55%. Improved anterior and lateral
wall motion. MR is 1+. Aortic contour is normal post
decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**12-28**] and underwent cardiac cath. Severe 3VD noted and
referred for surgery. Pre-op workup completed and went to OR
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**12-31**]. Please see operative note for details,
in summmary had coronary artery bypass grafting x3 with
left internal mammary artery grafted to the diagonal branch of
the LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to the marginal branch
and the posterior descending artery.
His bypass time was 60 minutes with a crossclamp time of 47
minutes. He tolerated the operation well and was transferred
from the operating room to the cardiac surgery ICU in stable
condition. He remained sedated on the day of surgery because of
a mild respiratory acidosis. His sedation was weaned and he was
extubated on the morning of POD1. After extubation he remained
in the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring seconadary to bradycardia
requiring Apacing to maintain his blood pressure. During this
time he also had an episode of post-operative atrial
fibrillation, he converted back to sinus rhythm with a bolus of
amiodarone. Chest tubes and pacing wires removed per protocol.
He was transferred from the ICU to the stepdown floor on POD4.
Once on the floor he was seen by physical therapy to begin
increasing his activity level. Gently diuresed toward his preop
weight. The remainder of his post operative course was
uneventful and he was cleared for discharge home with visiting
nurses on POD #6.
