IMAGING:
[**12-17**] CXR Interval worsening of mild pulmonary edema. Moderate
bibasilar atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.
[**12-17**] CT abd: Findings concerning for mesenteric ischemia with
portal venous air, with focus of air seen in mesentery centered
about loops of small bowel in the right mid abdomen with air
circumferentially surrounding the lumen suggestive of
pneumatosis and associated mesenteric stranding (301B:18-27).
Vascular event may represent etiology, though swirling
configuration suggests internal hernia.
[**12-18**] CXR improved basilar aeration. CVl well placed
[**12-20**] CXR New b/l poorly defined pulmonary opacities, some w/
nodular configuration.
[**12-20**] CXR Interval increase in diffuse widespread airspace
consolidation, ?ARDS.
[**12-21**] multifocal pneumonia. Co-existing ARDS is also possible.

[**1-2**] CXR: Worsening pulmonary edema. Evidence for bilateral
pleural
effusions, which may have increased as well.
[**1-4**] CXR:Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema has improved since

PATHOLOGY:
[**2178-12-17**] SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: ILEUM.

DIAGNOSIS:

Ileum, Segmental resection:
1.  Ischemic enteritis with focally transmural necrosis and
associated serositis.
2.  One unremarkable resection margin; opposite resection margin
with mucosal ischemic changes and acute inflammation of the
superficial submucosa.

Clinical:  Ischemic bowel, acute abdomen.
Gross:

The specimen is received fresh labeled with the patient's name,
"[**Known lastname **], [**Known firstname **]", the medical record number and "ileum." It
consists of a segment of small bowel measuring 92 cm in length
and 3 cm in average diameter.  A portion of mesentery is
attached to the small bowel that measures 2 x 4 x 3 cm. The
specimen is not oriented.  The mesentery is unremarkable. The
serosa of the bowel is focally erythematous and dusky looking.
There are two staples measuring 3.7 and 5.2 cm.  The specimen is
opened along the antimesenteric surface to reveal fecal material
and blood within the lumen. The mucosa in the central portion of
the bowel measuring 34 cm in length is erythematous, brown and
dusky looking. No masses or polyps are identified.  No
perforation site is i
