History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 77yo woman who initially presented to OSH c/o 2 days of
SSCP/SOB/DOE with acute worsening on day of admission.  In ED of
OSH she was found to have NSTEMI with Trop 5.8, EKG with poor R
wave progression in precordial leads.  Her SBP was in the 70s
and was placed on Dopamine.  Her O2 sat was 90's on NRB.  She
was started on integrillin/ [**First Name3 (LF) **] and was referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac catheterization.

Pertinent Results:
ECHO:
MEASUREMENTS:
Left Atrium - Long Axis Dimension: 3.3 cm (nl <= 4.0 cm)
Left Ventricle - Septal Wall Thickness: *1.4 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 1.0 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 4.9 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm)
Left Ventricle - Systolic Dimension: 3.9 cm
Left Ventricle - Fractional Shortening: *0.20 (nl >= 0.29)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 20% to 30% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Valve Level: 2.7 cm (nl <= 3.6 cm)
TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): *>= 36 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. Cannot exclude
ASD.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Severely depressed
LVEF. No resting LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter. Focal calcifications in
aortic root.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral
annular calcification. Mild thickening of mitral valve chordae.
Calcified tips
of papillary muscles. No MS.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Normal
tricuspid valve
supporting structures. Mild to moderate [[**12-5**]+] TR. Moderate PA
systolic
hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR. Normal main PA. No Doppler evidence for PDA

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. An atrial septal defect
cannot be excluded
(saline contrast injection negative at rest, but color flow
imaging suspicious
for ASD). There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function
is severely depressed (ejection fraction 20-30 percent)
secondary to severe
hypokinesis of the anterior septum, anterior free wall, lateral
wall, and
apex. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate
pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.





Brief Hospital Course:
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED patient was intubated for hypoxia and CHF while
supine.  She was taken to the cath lab where she was found to
have 99% Left Main Artery occlusion.  After discussion with CT
surgery, it was felt that she was not a surgical candidate due
to high risk and so a stent was placed in the Left Main Artery.
Cardiac index was decreased at 1.8 showing cardiogenic shock but
patient was not an IABP candidate secondary to extensive
peripheral artery disease.  During the catheterization she also
had a stent placed in the right Iliac artery.  She arrived in
the CCU on Dopamine for blood pressure support and intubated.
She was able to be weaned off Dopamine by hospital day #3.  As
she was placed on stress dose steroids at OSH, these were
initially continued but were soon after tapered by prednisone,
with goal of returning to her home Prednisone doseage of 5mg per
day for Temporal Arteritis.  Pt was extubated on [**2163-1-4**] and was
diuresed until she became euvolemic.  She was >91% saturated on
room air on discharge.

1. Cor: NSTEMI.  Cont [**Last Name (LF) 4532**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], lipitor, BB, ACE.  Pt has
bilateral SC stenosis so peripheral BP is 20 pts lower than
actual central BP.

2. Pump: CHF EF 20-30%.  Dopamine weaned off [**1-1**].  Pt was
initially started on Coumadin for apical hypokinesis, but this
was discontinued given her history of significant GI bleed and
her guiaic positive stool during this admission.

3. Rhythm: Multifocal Atrial Tachycardia: may be d/t COPD.  On a
beta-blocker, and her magnesium was repleted as needed.

4. Pulm: Extubated [**1-4**].  h/o COPD.  Atrovent nebs prn.  Her O2
Sats were kept between 92-93% given she is a CO2 retainer.

5. Renal: Cr at baseline 0.5

6. Rheum: Pt on prednisone 5mg qd for temporal arteritis at
baseline, now being tapered from stress doses.

7. FEN: Pt was seen by speech and swallow after extubation and
was found to be aspirating thin liquids.  She is on nectar thick
and soft solids.

8. Dispo: Pt was d/c'd to short term rehab and will soon live
with her son who will serve as her primary caregiver.
