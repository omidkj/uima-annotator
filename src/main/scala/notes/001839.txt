Brief Hospital Course:
57 y/o male with known ETOH abuse, HTN, hyperlipidemia, AFib on
Coumadin/digoxin transferred from [**Hospital 1562**] Hosp after 5 day
admission for hemorrhagic pancreatitis and ARDS. On arrival to
SICU pt was intubated and sedated and was receiving TPN,
imipenem (7 day course). No pressor support. During the one week
ICU course, pt was slowly weaned from vent support, started on
TF and diuresed. Pt did have some renal failure during the
course, but this has since resolved, with current creat at
probable baseline of 1.3. CT showed evidence of severe
pancreatitis with a large amount of fluid and stranding
surrounding the pancreas, extending into the left paracolic
gutter, left anterior and posterior perirenal space, and right
perirenal space. Free fluid is seen extending down into the
pelvis. Assessment of pancreas enhancement is limited, but
appears relatively uniform. No definite thrombus is identified
within the portal and splenic veins. There were also moderate to
large bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis.
Extubation was on [**6-12**], and patient continued to improve and was
transferred to the regular floor on [**6-15**]. Originally pt had a
1:1 sitter which was d/c'd on [**6-16**]. Pt has worked with PT and
has advanced diet. It was felt that he did not require physical
rehab. He required outpatient counseling/work at detox center.
He was discharged home on insulin. He was instructed in how to
check his blood sugars as well as self administer insulin.
He was advised to follow up with PCP as well as an outpatient
gastroenterologist.
