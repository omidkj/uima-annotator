Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1711**]
Chief Complaint:
elective admission for tracheal stent


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis
Pulmonary Stenting


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 88214**] is a 65 yom with h/o hyperlipidemia, s/p pacemaker,
Hep C ([**1-11**] to IVDU 30 yrs prior and untreated), h/o PTX, alcohol
abuse, and smoking p/w SCLCA s/p 6 cycles etop/cisplatin, large
mediastinal masses with critical obstruction to the LUL who was
admitted for elective stent placement and is being transferred
to the CCU for pericardial effusion with early tamponade
physiology.  Per the outside report, he had progressive cough
and voice changes over the past few months and reports trouble
with both solids and liquids.  He has had weight loss of
approximately 15-20 lbs during this time as well.  Biopsy of his
left upper lung mass was consistent with small cell lung cancer
in [**11-16**].  CT brain with contrast was negative for mets.  PET
scan showed b/l subcarinal nodes but no more distant disease.
He was recently noted to have very bulky [**Location (un) 21851**] with LUL
collapse and partial occlusion of the left pulmonary artery.
Patient presented for direct admit for stent placement but CT
scan showed pericardial effusion and pulsus was reportedly
measured on the floor to be 15-20. Cardiology fellow was called
for evaluation. Bedside echo showed RV collapse with signs of
tamponade.  Transfer to CCU for monitoring with plan for
pericardiocentesis in AM.
.
On review of systems, s/he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. S/he denies recent fevers, chills or
rigors. S/he denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the
other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Past Medical History:
-SCLC:
[**11-16**] - SCLCA diagnosed, had etoposide/carboplatin with 6th
cycle given [**4-17**] (good tolerance).
[**2-16**] and [**3-18**]: RT done
[**2-16**]: showed regression in most areas.
[**5-18**]: reduction in mass, persistent subtotal central occlusion
of LUL bronchus, reduction in constriction of pulmonary artery
to the LUL and reduction in central adenopathy, reexpansion of
LUL.
[**4-17**]: last chemo
[**2180-6-1**]: PET showed reduction in all areas, no new areas.
[**2180-6-14**]: hemoptysis of teaspoon 5cc BRB. CT scan noted for new
infiltrate showing encasement of artery to LUL and subtotal
occlusion of the bronchus to the LUL. Smoking was continued at
this point 2ppd. Bronchoscopy by Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] was suspiciuous for
tumor.
[**8-18**]: continued worsening of hoarseness, paroxysmal cough, left
anterior chest dsicomfort, increased dyspnea, no other pain or
headache, no addtional bleed.
CT: increasing central adenopathy, narrowing of left mainstem
bronchus to [**12-11**] of the right bronchus, complete obliteration of
the LUL bronchus with collapse of LUL with compromise of left
pulmonary artery. Bronchus to LLL, lingular were compromised.
Started on: Etoposide and carboplatin - 2 cycles, progressive
disease noted, has a pericardial effusion.
- continued to be symptomatic dyspnea, no dysphagia, continued
anorexia. presented for paliative treatment.

Studies:
Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2180-11-29**] at 9:10:48 PM
Conclusions
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
The right ventricular cavity is unusually small. with normal
free wall contractility. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is a moderate to large sized pericardial
effusion. No right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. There
is brief right atrial diastolic collapse.

IMPRESSION: Moderate to large pericardial effusion located
mostly at the LV apex and LV inferolateral wall. There is
relatively little fluid overlying the right ventricular free
wall. Apical approach to pericardiocentesis likely better. No
frank echo evidence of tamponade although both ventricles are
small and patient is tachycardic.

Cardiac Cath	Study Date of [**2180-11-30**]
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Successful pericardiocentesis with 240 cc of serosanguinous
fluid
removed with access obtained under echocardiographic guidance
and
pericardial drainage bag secured and sutured into position.
(refer to
comments section)
2. Monitor drainage with plan for removal of drain in 24-36
hours

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)	Study Date of [**2180-11-30**] 5:22 PM
FINDINGS: The patient is intubated, the tip of the endotracheal
tube projects 4.5 cm above the carina. Massive volume loss in
the left lung due to fibrosis and consolidations. Subsequent
elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. A central airway stent is
visible.

No pathological changes in the right lung.

Portable TTE (Focused views) Done [**2180-11-30**] at 12:00:00 PM
Conclusions
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There is no pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

IMPRESSION: Prior to tap, moderate to large circumferential
pericardial effusion is seen. Post-tap, there is minimal fluid
with normal biventricular function.

Brief Hospital Course:
65yo M with metastatic SCLC admitted for tracheal stent
placement, found to have pericardial effusion with concern for
early tamponade physiology on TTE, hemodynamically stable now.

# Pericardial effusion: He presented with reported shortness of
breath. He had a pulsus paradoxus of 15-20. He had questionable
tamponade physiology on echo. He was hemodynamically stable,
