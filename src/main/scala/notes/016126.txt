Pathology Examination:
SPECIMEN SUBMITTED: GALLBLADDER & PANCREATIC CALCULUS.
Procedure date  [**2117-5-13**]
DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Gallbladder (A-B):  Mild chronic cholecystitis. Unremarkable
lymph node.
2.  Pancreatic calculus: Calculi measuring up to 0.4 cm, gross
diagnosis only.
Clinical: Chronic pancreatitis.
.
EKG:
-Cardiology ECG [**2117-5-16**]
Sinus rhythm. Delayed R wave transition in the anterior
precordial leads of unclear significance. No previous tracing
available for comparison
-Cardiology ECG [**2117-5-19**]
Sinus tachycardia. Compared with previous tracing of [**2117-5-16**] the
heart rate is increased. Otherwise, no major change.
.
IMAGING:
CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY  [**2117-5-16**]
1. No evidence of PE.
2. Significant collapse in consolidation in both bases with
mucous plugging.
.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2117-5-23**]
Nonspecific bowel gas pattern. Bowel obstruction cannot be
excluded. Upper abdominal calcifications consistent with chronic
pancreatitis.
.
RENAL U.S.  [**2117-5-23**]
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis. Bilateral mild increase
parenchymal echogenicity consitent with parenchymal renal
disease.
2. Small right kidney
.
DUPLEX DOP ABD/PEL LIMITED  [**2117-5-24**]
1. No hydronephrosis.
2. Limited Doppler study, as noted above. Although arterial
waveforms demonstrate a swift upstroke, low amplitudes are
suggested, bilaterally. Given the finding of a significantly
smaller right kidney, renal artery stenosis cannot be excluded
and further workup is warranted.
.
CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST  [**2117-5-25**]
1. Bibasilar ground-glass opacities, suspicious for aspiration
or infection.
2. Tiny bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.
3. Findings suspicious for high-grade small-bowel obstruction
likely in the region of the mid ileum and distal to the
jejunojejunostomy.
4. Evidence of Puestow procedure.
5. Evidence of chronic pancreatitis.
6. Two sub 5-mm nonobstructing stones in the lower pole of the
right kidney. Findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4401**] at completion of the examination.
.
ABDOMEN (SUPINE & ERECT)  [**2117-5-27**]
1. Unchanged appearance of multiple dilated loops of small bowel
which measure up to 4 cm. Continued followup is recommended.
2. Status post pancreaticojejunostomy with surgical clips noted
within the left upper quadrant area.
3. Chronic pancreatitis as evidenced by multiple small
calcifications projecting over the pancreatic area.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted on [**2117-5-13**] for a Posterolateral
pancreaticojejunostomy (Puestow), Removal of pancreatic
calculus, Open cholecystectomy, Placement of J-tube.

Pain: APS was following this patient given her chronic pain and
pain med usage. Epidural not placed given preop SBP in mid 70's.
Dilaudid PCA Basal rate 0.25mg/hr plus bolus 0.25mg q6min
(titrated bolus dose as needed). Ketorolac 15mg IV q6hr x3days
was added on POD 1.  On [**5-13**], increased PCA to .37mg
Bolus/.25mgbasal, Vistaril25mgIM q4hr.  On [**5-14**] increased PCA to
.4mgBolus/.37Basal, Ketamine 1-5mg/hr, Vistaril.  This regimen
relieved her pain somewhat but she was still complaining of pain
despite the large amounts of narcotics.  At times she was very
somnolent secondary most likely to the large narcotic
requirements.  She was started on methylphenidate to counter
this.  Her pain medications were gradually titrated down and
eventually her pain subsided to the point where she was refusing
all pain medication.  However, she did resume her methadone
prior to discharge.

CV: Her HR was mildly tachycardic and her SBPs were persistently
in the 70's-low 100's.  EKG's showed only sinus tachycardia.
However, her BP's improved towards the end of her stay and
remained >90.

Resp: She experienced multiple episodes of desats post-op
