Service: SURGERY

Allergies:
No Known Allergies / Adverse Drug Reactions

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6088**]
Chief Complaint:
Right lower extremity ischemia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right common iliac artery stent placement and right external
iliac recanalization with stent placement x2.
Tracheostomy


History of Present Illness:
52F h/o MR had been living at [**Last Name (un) 18355**] Center sustained
unspecified trauma to R foot which became increasingly mottled.
History obtained from transfer records from [**Last Name (un) 1724**] as patient is a
poor historian secondary to MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] became increasingly painful
and was cold to the touch, with no dopplerable signals in her
distal extremities on admission to [**Last Name (un) 1724**] on [**2111-1-7**]. She
underwent arteriogram showing occluded bilateral CFA with distal
reconstitution. R BKA was offered, and family requested second
opinion and transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. During her hospital course at
[**Last Name (un) 1724**], she developed respiratory distress secondary to pulmonary
edema requiring ICU transfer, supplemental oxygen, and
furosemide diuresis. Echocardiogram showed EF 55% with mild
inferior hypokinesis. Vanco and zosyn were started empirically
for a question of hospital aquired pneumonia.

Brief Hospital Course:
Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] her oxygen saturtaion was in the mid 90s
on face tent oxygen.  Shortly thereafter she became tachypnic
and desaturated to the 70s.  This initially improved with chest
PT, nebulizers, and increased oxygen however she developed
recurrent desaturations and began stating "I can't breath."
Additionally she was having significant spells of coughing with
difficulty clearing mucus. At this point a code blue was
initiated and she was intubated after several attempts with
significant difficulty. She was ultimately intubated with a 5F
ETT as all larger tubes could not be passed [**1-14**] to her
tracheomalacia.  She was then transferred to the ICU for further
care.  Her family was contact[**Name (NI) **] and informed of her clinical
changes.

On HD 2, she underwent an open tracheostomy.  For further
details of the procedure, please refer to the separately
dictated operative note.  She tolerated the procedure well.  On
HD 3, she underwent a right lower extremity angiogram which
showed near-occlusion of mid right common iliac artery and
complet occlusion of the native external iliac.  Stents were
able to be placed in both arteries and post-stent angiogram
showed a flush SFA occlusion and reconstitution of the mid SFA
with patent popliteal and distal runoff below this.  For further
details of the procedure, please refer to the separately
dictated operative note.  She tolerated the procedure well and a
heparin drip was maintained after her procedure.  The ischemic
changes on her lower extremity had improvement after the
procedure, however, over the next few days it was clear that her
toes probably would not be a salvageable.  She was continued on
a heparin drip but can be transitioned to coumadin with lovenox
bridge. It was decided to allowed the area of ischemia to
demarcate better and to perform an amputation, possibly a TMA,
at a later time.  Her ventilatory requirements were gradually
weaned over a few days postoperatively and she was able to
tolerate trach mask for longer periods of time each day.  Her
history of CHF and pulmonary edema has not been an issue since
her initial presentation and her blood pressure has been well
controlled on a PO regimen.  She did have periods of agitation,
however, the addition of clonidine helped to maintain both her
blood pressure controlled and calm her during her periods of
agitation.  Her antibiotics were discontinued without signs of
infection.
