Chief Complaint:
Chief Complaint: RUQ pain

Reason for MICU transfer:  Post-ERCP monitoring, intubated


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone removal

History of Present Illness:
41 year old female with h/o intracranial hemorrhage s/p
craniotomy with seizures and L hemiparesis, obesity who
initially presented to [**Hospital6 204**] [**10-30**] with RUQ
discomfort. The patient described the RUQ discomfort as acute in
onset, constant and associated with nausea and back pain. No
vomiting, fevers, CP, or SOB. No known precipitating factors.
Notably, the patient presented to [**Hospital 189**] Hospital on [**2189-9-18**]
with abdominal pain and underwent CT abd that showed peri-GB fat
stranding. She was not admitted on that occassion.

At [**Hospital1 189**], the patient was noted to have a low-grade fever to
100.1, HR of 92 and a (+) murphys sign. Initially laboratory
values showed AST OF 374, ALT of 425, Tbili of 1.5 (Dbili 1.2),
elevated Alk Phos and normal amylase/lipase. WBC was 5.7. A RUQ
US was performed showing numerous gallstones but no evidence of
acute cholecystitis. On HOD #1, the patient's Tbili climbed to
2.5 and her LFTs continued to rise. Per report temp was 102.3
(10pm [**10-31**]). Was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for ERCP. Oxygen sats
prior to transfer were low 90s and the patient was placed on a
facemask.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**], the patient was hypoxic to the high 90%s on
face mask, low 80s on RA. Intubated and underwent ERCP with
general anestesia. 2 stones were removed from the CBD and a
sphincterotomy was performed. Following the procedure, the
patient was not able to be extubated and was transferred to the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for further mgmt. Of note, the patient intermittently
requires O2 at nursing facility (for desats to mid 80s).

In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], the patient was initially hypotensive to the 80s
systolic. Propofol was reduced and the patient's PEEP was turned
down with good response.

Studies:

[**2189-11-1**] ERCP:
Successful cannulation of the bile duct (cannulation)
Two stones at the biliary tree
A sphincterotomy was performed.
2 stones were extracted successfully using a balloon
catheter(sphincterotomy, stone extraction)
Otherwise normal ercp to third part of the duodenum

CT Chest ([**2189-11-2**]) - 1. The endotracheal tube has its tip
approximately 1.5 cm above the carina. It should be repositioned
by pulling back at least 2-3 cm. The patient's nurse, [**Doctor First Name **], was
notified of the need for repositioning at 2:30 p.m. on [**2189-11-1**]
and informed me that the tube has already been repositioned and
a followup chest film has been ordered. 2. Consolidative process
within the left lung with some residual aerated lung at the left
base and in the region of the lingula. Although this may
represent atelectasis, other processes such as aspiration,
pulmonary hemorrhage or pneumonia should be considered. The
right lung is low in volume but grossly clear. Cardiac and
mediastinal contours are difficult to assess due to marked
patient rotation on the current examination.

CT Head ([**2189-11-2**]) - IMPRESSION: 1. Left frontal approach
ventriculostomy shunt catheter terminating in the region of the
septum pellucidum. There is no hydroceph
