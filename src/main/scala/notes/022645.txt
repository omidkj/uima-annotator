Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
aspirin / Penicillins / ibuprofen

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1973**]
Chief Complaint:
Hematemesis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD

History of Present Illness:
60yoF with Hepatitis C cirrhosis, with mechanical aortic,
tricuspid, mitral valves on Coumadin, h/o afib, h/o upper GI
bleed in the past [**3-15**] Dieulfoy lesion presenting with
hematemesis.

The patient reportedly awoke the morning of presentation to find
her pillow soaked with blood, unclear whether she coughed up or
vomited the blood. She reports epigastric abdominal pain and
nausea, and she took Maalox for her pain with improvement. She
presented to [**Hospital3 17163**] where she reportedly coughed
blood in ED with a stable Hct of 31.6 -> 32.9 and BP 110 near
her baseline. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
evaluation of her hematemesis vs hemoptysis. She denies recent
fevers, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea (although she
does endorse frequent stools since her last hospitalization),
denies chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath.

Of note, the patient reportedly has had several GIB's in the
past due to a Dieulafoy lesion including a recent episode in
[**2158-6-7**] during which she was intubated with a hct 20 and 500cc
bloody NGT output. She had an EGD at [**Hospital3 17162**] at that time
which showed a Dieulfoy lesion with active bleeding which was
clipped x2, and she was discharged on PPI for chronic
suppressive therapy. She reports that since her discharge, she
has experienced continued nausea but denies any abdominal pain
or hematemesis.

In [**Hospital1 18**] the ED, initial VS: 98.0 70 96/62 16 97% 2L Nasal
Cannula
The patient was found to have mild abdominal discomfort and on
rectal exam, had brown, guiac positive stool. Her Hct was stable
from the findings at [**Hospital3 17163**], and her BP's remained
at her baseline in the 100's. INR was 3.5. NG lavage revealed
flecks of blood which were guiac positive, and subsequently put
out 200cc of bright red blood mixed with stomach contents. The
NG tube reportedly put out another 200cc of bright red blood
prior to clearing on suction. She did not have any further
episodes of emesis subsequently. GI was consulted and
recommended Octreotide gtt, Protonix gtt, and Ceftriaxone. She
was transferred to the MICU for further management. On transfer,
VS were: 105/47 65 98% 2L NC.

On arrival to the MICU, the patient reported continued abdominal
pain but denied nausea, hematemesis, hematochezia, chest pain,
shortness of breath, lightheadedness.
