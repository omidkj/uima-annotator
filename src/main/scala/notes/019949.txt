Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an
82-year-old African-American female with a history of
coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes
mellitus, and hypertension, who presented to an outside
hospital with a chief complaint of shortness of breath.
A chest x-ray at the outside hospital was consistent with
congestive heart failure with cephalization of the pulmonary
vessels and bilateral infiltrates.  The patient was
aggressively treated with Lasix, morphine, and nitrates, and
her symptoms improved at the outside hospital.

Over the next few days, she continued to have flash pulmonary
edema and complained of jaw pain that was burning in nature
and radiated down her left upper extremity.  She was
transferred to the [**Hospital6 256**] for
catheterization to determine if ischemia could be the primary
cause of her symptoms.

During catheterization it was noticed that the patient had
in-stent restenosis of a previous lesion.  In an attempt to
clear the lesion, the patient went into cardiac arrest
requiring CPR, epinephrine, and atropine.  LAD blood flow was
reestablished with a successful placement of a stent.  The
patient was intubated and placed on pressors and transferred
to the CCU for further management.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her daughter.  [**Name (NI) **] movement
is limited from bed-to-chair.

1.  Norvasc 10 mg q.d.
2.  Lasix 60 mg IV b.i.d.
3.  Imdur 60 mg q.d.
4.  Levaquin 250 mg q.d.
5.  Lopressor 50 mg b.i.d.
6.  Elavil 75 mg q.d.
7.  Epogen 5,000 units q. week.
8.  Pepcid 20 mg q.d.
9.  Mucomyst 600 mg b.i.d.
10. Levothyroxine 175 micrograms q.d.
11. Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
12. NPH insulin 44 units in the morning along with 6
additional units in the evening.

LABORATORY DATA UPON ADMISSION: Blood gas 7.31, PC02 49, PA02
86.  Sodium 151, potassium 4.0, chloride 105, bicarbonate 31,
BUN 67, creatinine 2.7, glucose 129, magnesium 1.8.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  General:  The patient was
a well-developed, obese African-American female who appeared
her stated age.  Cardiovascular:  Her heart sounds were
distant.  She had a regular rate and rhythm, S3 and S4 could
not be appreciated.  Pulmonary:  Clear to auscultation
anteriorly, posterior was not examined.  HEENT:  The pupils
were equally round and reactive to light.  The mucous
membranes were moist.  Extremities:  There were +1 DPs
bilaterally.  She had trace edema.  No cyanosis or clubbing
was noticed.  Her abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended
with positive bowel sounds.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is an 82-year-old African-American
female with a complicated medical history admitted from an
outside hospital for further evaluation of her congestive
heart failure.  Her catheterization revealed an LAD lesion
estimated to be about 80% in stent re-stenosis in the mid LAD
along with a 40% ostial lesion.  Diagonal 1 showed severe
diffuse disease.  Her left circumflex showed 70% proximal
lesion along with a 50% and 80% lesion found in the OM1.  Her
right coronary showed diffuse disease throughout.

During an attempt to correct her LAD lesion, it appears that
the LAD was dissected which led to no blood flow in the LAD.
The patient had cardiac arrest while in the Catheterization
Laboratory.  She was successfully resuscitated with
epinephrine, atropine, and CPR.  She was intubated and placed
on pressors and returned to the floor for further medical
management.

On the second day of admission, the patient was successfully
weaned off of her pressors and her intra-aortic balloon pump
was removed.  Later on that evening, however, the patient
became hypotensive with a blood pressure of approximately
60/40.  She also developed an accelerated junctional rhythm
with retrograde atrial conduction.  She was placed on
dopamine and Neo for pressor support.  Laboratories were
taken and it was found that the patient's creatinine was 4.4.
Her potassium was 7.0.  She had an elevated anion gap of
approximately 23 and her lactic acid at that time was 11.

It is believed that the patient was having ischemic bowel,
Surgery and GI were both consulted and after discussion with
the family they decided that they would not undergo surgery
at that time.  The option of dialysis was also offered to the
family and the family chose not to pursue dialysis at that
point.  The issue of DNR/DNI was discussed.  The family also
made the patient DNR/DNI.  They further made the patient
comfort measures only.

As the pressors were weaned off and the patient was
extubated, she experienced respiratory arrest followed by
cardiac arrest and the patient was pronounced dead at 4:15 in
the afternoon of [**2149-10-13**].  The family was at the
bedside throughout the whole process.  The appropriate
authorities were contact[**Name (NI) **].
