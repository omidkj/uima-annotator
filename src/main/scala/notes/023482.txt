Service:  FENARD ICU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old female
with history of Stage IV pulmonary sarcoidosis and asthma,
who presented to the Emergency Room with complaint of bright
red blood per rectum.  The patient was recently hospitalized
at [**Hospital6 **] for a flare of her chronic pulmonary
disease, and was discharged to [**Hospital1 **] for pulmonary rehab.
Patient was brought to [**Hospital1 69**]
Emergency Department from [**Hospital1 **] after having progressive
lightheadedness for approximately a week and then was noted
to be hypotensive with systolic pressures in the 60s.

On the morning of admission, she had a large amount of bright
red blood per rectum on two occasions.  Denied abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, or chills.  She has no history
of GI bleed in the past.  She has been taking aspirin for the
two weeks prior.  She had also noted constipation for two
weeks, but bowel movements have been softer in the previous
several days.

In the Emergency Department, she was treated with IV fluids
with improvement in her blood pressure to 119/54 and a heart
rate of 116.  She had a nasogastric lavage performed, which
was negative for blood or coffee-ground emesis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Sarcoidosis for the past 20 years, now stage IV.
2. Hypertension.
3. Asthma.
4. Status post bilateral breast implants.
5. Status post right shoulder arthroplasty.
6. History of mild congestive heart failure.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS AT [**Hospital1 **]:
1. Cozaar 25 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Combivent two puffs q.i.d.
3. Flovent two puffs b.i.d.
4. Multivitamin.
5. Aspirin 81 mg q.d..
6. Prednisone.
7. Levofloxacin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  [**Hospital 8735**] medical assistant.  No history of
tobacco or alcohol.

FAMILY HISTORY:  A son with diabetes and a mother with
uterine and breast cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Initial vitals in the Emergency
Department were a temperature of 98.4, heart rate 115, blood
pressure 77/34, respiratory rate 22, and oxygen saturation of
100% on 2 liters.  General:  Lying in bed in no acute
distress.  HEENT:  No scleral icterus.  Neck is supple.
Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular:
Tachycardic with a regular rhythm, normal S1, S2, and
systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border.
Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds
present.  Rectal:  Per ED resident, showed bright red blood
in the vault.  Extremities:  No edema.

STUDIES:  EKG:  Sinus tachycardia at 115.  ST elevations in
V1 and V2 which were old and ST depressions in V3 through V6
which were new compared with EKG in [**2145**].

LABORATORIES:  White count 20, hematocrit 26.8, platelets
204.  INR 1.1.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:
1. GI:  The patient was admitted with bright red blood per
rectum which was thought to be a lower GI bleed as the
patient had a negative nasogastric lavage in the Emergency
Department.  She received 2 units of packed red blood cells
with appropriate improvement in her hematocrit and did not
require any further transfusions.

On [**9-14**], a colonoscopy was attempted, but was aborted
after the patient had respiratory decompensation during
sedation.  There was no more gross evidence of
gastrointestinal bleeding during the hospital and the GI
Service recommended that a barium enema be arranged by the
patient's primary care physician as an outpatient if further
evaluation is desired.  Patient will be discharged on a
proton-pump inhibitor and her aspirin will be held.

2. Pulmonary:  Patient has a history of chronic lung disease
and had some mild dyspnea on admission.  Her initial
respiratory decompensation occurred in the setting of
sedation for the attempted colonoscopy.  However, following
this, she had several episodes of shortness of breath
requiring CPAP on a setting of 15 and 5.  After several days
of episodic decompensation, she was treated empirically with
a short course of azithromycin, diuresis with Lasix, and IV
steroids.

After this, she did start to improve most likely due to a
brisk diuresis that was achieved.  At the time of discharge,
she has not required CPAP for over three days and states that
her respiratory status is markedly improved.

3. Cardiovascular:  The patient has a history of congestive
heart failure, which is presumably diastolic dysfunction.
She had an echocardiogram in [**Month (only) 216**] at [**Hospital6 **]
which showed an ejection fraction of 65%, mild concentric
left ventricular hypertrophy without evidence of outflow
tract obstruction.  Systolic anterior motion of the mitral
valve leaflet was present as well as trace mitral
regurgitation, 1+ tricuspid regurgitation, and she has an
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 45 mm Hg.

The patient's respiratory status improved during this
hospitalization over two days, where approximately 4 liters
were diuresed.  She will be discharged with instructions to
take 20 mg of Lasix on days where her weight increases by 2
pounds or more and she will weigh herself at the same time
everyday.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Medically stable for discharge home
with followup with her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 449**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3510**], as well as her pulmonologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at
[**Hospital6 **].

The patient will also have VNA services at home for
respiratory evaluation and pulmonary rehab.  When the patient
feels ready to drive or take public transportation, she has
instructions on how to arrange for outpatient pulmonary rehab
here at the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Center.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Prednisone taper over two weeks.
2. Lansoprazole 30 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Verapamil 240 mg in the morning and 120 mg at night
sustained release.
4. Advair discus one inhalation b.i.d.
5. Combivent 1-2 puffs q.6h. as needed.
6. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d. if gains two or more pounds.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed now stable.
2. Flare of pulmonary sarcoidosis and asthma.
