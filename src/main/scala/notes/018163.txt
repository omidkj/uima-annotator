History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 54 y.o. F with a history of sarcoidosis and CHF
and Factor V Leiden deficiency admitted for SOB and confusion.
Pt was recently admitted to hospital twice in the last 2 months
and several times during the last year with diagnosis of CHF
exacerbation vs. sarcoidosis. Her most recent hospitalization on
[**8-10**] she was found to have CHF exacerbation w/ elevated
BNP to 12,000 for which she had her Lasix 20mg PO QOD restarted
with improvement of her symptoms and she was sent home. She
states that she has been feeling okay and to have ongoing SOB
which seem worse in the last 2 days. She uses oxygen 2L at home,
and as per ED report she was sating in the mid to low 80s%
yesterday. She also has increase non-productive cough w/ occ
sputum that feels "siment". She has orthopnea and does not
tolerate laying flat. Her husband has also noticed that she also
appears confused, asking repetitive questions and seem to be
obsessing over certain subjects. She denies missing any doses of
her lasix. She states that she felt febrile yesterday, but did
not check a temp. She denies having any chest pain, no sick
contacts or upper airway symptoms.
.
In the ED today her vitals were 99.0, 121, SBP 127, RR 20s-mid
40s- sating in 89% on RA, going to mid 80s, 4l comes up to Mid
90s. Her initial ABG was pH 7.35 pCO2 76 pO2 56 HCO3 44. PE
noticible for crackles at bil bases. CXRAY Extensive fibrosis
with no significant change from prior. No consolidations. She
was given 20mg of IV lasix with good response in UO 100cc/hr
with some improvement of symptoms.
.
Of note, patient reports that she is very concerned about this
skin rash. She says she has the skin rash on her arms, legs,
ears. The rash forms papules with clear exudate. When the
exudate is released, she says her entire body feels the
sensation, causing her to cough and feel mucus in her throat.
She has spoken to her PCP about this who is arranging her to
follow with dermatology.
.
On floor, Vitals: temp 98.7, HR in 120s, RR 30s-low 40s, sating
in upper 90s%. Pt w/ increase work of breathing while speaking.
Sleepy, but easily arousable to verbal stimuli.

ECHO [**9-5**]:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with setpum and inferior
akinesis and hypokinesis of the inferolateral walls. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed
(LVEF= 30 %). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2163-9-4**],
the left ventricular systolic function is similar.

Neurology Studies:
EEG [**9-8**]
This EEG monitoring from 7:50 until 14:20 on [**2163-9-8**] showed a low voltage encephalopathic background with
widespread
alpha frequencies at times (likely representing medication
effect) and
periods of more widespread suppression. There were no focal
abnormalities, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.
There
were no epileptiform features.
EEG [**9-7**]
This telemetry showed a slow background throughout,
indicative of an encephalopathy. There were no areas of
prominent focal
slowing, but encephalopathies may obscure focal findings. There
were no
epileptiform features or electrographic seizures. There were no
pushbutton activations.
