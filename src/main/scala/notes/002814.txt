[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 92613**] is a 55 year-old RHM who presented by ambulance to
[**Hospital1 18**] emergency room after he had sudden onset of left sided
numbness and then weakness. He states that he had just come home
from work at CVS where he is a manager and had been sitting down
and watch television (NCIS). At 12:45 am he noticed a sudden
numbness of his left hand that felt like pins and needles. He
was
able to open and close the hand and became frightened and stood
up. When he got up he noticed that he was having difficulty
standing on his left foot and that it had a numb feeling as
well.
He shouted out for help from his brother who he lives with and
he
called 911. On arrival to the the hospital a code stroke was
called and he scored a 2 on the NIHSS for left sided sensory
deficits and tactile extinction on the left. Blood glucose was
368. A CT was performed, but revealed a hemorrhage so tPA was
not
given.

the medications since [**Month (only) 404**] as he says that he cannot afford
the copay. He was recently transitioned to a part-time employee
at CVS and lost his medication benefit.

He says that he wakes up almost every hour during the night to
urinate, and has been extremely tired, but otherwise reports no
recent changes in his health.
