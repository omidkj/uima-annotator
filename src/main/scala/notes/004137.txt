Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 15397**]
Chief Complaint:
Left knee pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Revision of left knee replacement

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 60992**] is a 69-year-old gentleman with a past medical
history significant for OSA, HTN, sinus bradycardia, chronic
renal failure, bipolar disorder, BPH who was admitted for a
total left knee replacement, subsequently transferred to the
MICU for fever and hypotension, now transferred to the general
medicine floor upon resolution of his symptoms.

Patient presented on [**9-13**] for left TKA, and did well post-op
with mild hypotension on [**9-13**] to systolic 80s.  However, he
spiked a fever to 101.2 on [**9-14**] with no obvious source.  He then
triggered for delirium on [**9-15**] and labs were notable for
worsening renal function, Cr 2.3 from 1.8, and WBC 13.2 from
9.7.  Med consult was called for fever workup and management of
delirium.  Patient then spiked another fever to 102.3, and
triggered again for hypotension with systolics in the 80s.

A voiding trial was attempted on [**9-15**] but patient could not
urinate so a foley was replaced.  He was written for 1L bolus
and started on Vanc/Cipro to cover for possible knee infection,
given recent operation, though no signs of infection of the left
knee. Prior to transfer to the MICU, his VS were 102.3 90/48,
74, 98% on 2LNC.

On arrival to the MICU patient complained of pain in his right
arm and wrist, which he attributed to overuse from writing
multiple notes on Facebook.  Patient was continued on vanc/cipro
and given 2 more liters of IVF.  His blood pressure stabilized
and he was discharged back to the general medicine floor on
[**9-16**].  Ortho will follow closely.

On transfer from MICU, vitals were: 98, 102/60, 76, 16, 96% on
RA.

ROS:  Patient complains of being asked too many questions.  He
reports pain in his right shoulder and wrist.  Discomfort on his
left thigh from traction device.  No chest pain, shortness of
breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  Denies chills or feeling
feverish.  Has foley in place.  Has not moved his bowel since
surgery.

Imaging:
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2152-9-15**]: IMPRESSION:  New
pleural effusions, left greater than right

RIGHT WRIST FILM [**2152-9-16**]:
RIGHT WRIST: Extensive degenerative changes are present within
the right wrist.  It is maximal at the radial-carpal junction.
There is, however, no evidence of a fracture present.
IMPRESSION:  Degenerative changes within the carpal bones.

CXR: FINDINGS:  Single frontal image of the chest demonstrates
new opacity at the left lateral lung base which could be
consistent with fluid and/or atelectasis.  It is difficult to
assess this opacity fully given the patient's extremely rotated
position.  Lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no pneumothorax.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged from prior imaging.
IMPRESSION:  New left lateral lung base opacity consistent with
pleural effusion and/or atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
69M with hist [**Last Name (un) **] of OSA, HTN, sinus bradycardia, CKD (baseline
cr 1.8), bipolar disorder, BPH with history of urinary retention
who presents after revision of left knee replacement. The course
was complicated by hypotension, fevers, urinary retention, gout
and pneumonia.

# Pneumonia: The patient had fevers to 102, a rising
leukocytosis, productive cough and delirium. He had an CXR which
showed an opacity in the left base. It was not clearly
infectious in etiology, however, given the clinical symptoms we
treated him for health care associated pneumonia with vancomycin
and cefepime for a 7 day course to be completed on [**2152-8-31**]. The
fevers resolved, his delirium improved as did his cough. The
patient and his family refused any further studies such at CT of
the chest. Given his clinical improvement we felt that he was
safe to discharge with a course of antibiotics to be completed
at rehab. After completion of his antibiotics, he should be
monitored for temperature or othesigns of infection.

# Acute gout: The patient had significant right wrist swelling
and pain worse with active or passive movement. Given his fevers
there was some concern for gout vs septic arthritis. He had a
joint aspiration which was consistent with crystalopathy. Given
his kidney function he was treated with a prednisone taper with
significant improvement in his wrist pain and mobility. He has a
total of 4 more days of prednisone (as outlined in medication
list).

# Left knee revision: Per report of our orthodist service went
well. No evidence of infection of left knee. The joint is warm
but the incision is clear/dry/intact. The recommendations of
orthopedists are listed below:

- Please keep your wounds clean. You may shower starting five
(5) days after surgery, but no tub baths or swimming for at
least four (4) weeks. No dressing is needed if wound continues
to be non-draining. Any stitches or staples that need to be
removed will be taken out at first follow up appointment two
weeks after your surgery.
- Please DO NOT take any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
medications (NSAIDs such as celebrex, ibuprofen, advil, aleve
