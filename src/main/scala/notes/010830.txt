History of Present Illness:
78 year old male s/p CABG [**2115**] who was admitted to [**Hospital 6451**] medical center and transferred to [**Hospital1 **]. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2133-12-16**] he had a cardiac catheterization
and had a stent placed to his OM 3.0 x 8mm bare metal stent.
Patient was admitted to [**Hospital3 417**] on [**2134-1-31**] with
chest pain and ruled out for an MI, and had a stress test that
noted an inferobasal reversible defect. He states he has been
under a lot of stress since his wife has passed away a couple of
weeks ago. Patient complained of chest discomfort on the left
side that radiated down to his right arm accompanied by
shortness of breath and diaphoresis this occurred one week ago
while eating out at a restaurant. After taking three sublingual
nitroglcerin with no change he went to Good [**Hospital 39888**] hospital
ER, where he ruled out for an MI. He has also experienced on two
separate occasions mid-sternal chest pressure while at rest; the
pain was relieved by one slntg. He is now having a cardiac
catheterization for further cardiac evaluation.

Pertinent Results:
[**2134-2-11**] Cardiac Catheterization: 1. Coronary angiography in this
right dominant system demonstrated two vessel disease. The LMCA
had no angiographically apparent disease. The LAD was occluded
in its mid-portion. The LCx had minimal luminal regularities.
The RCA had hazy proximal filling defects with up to 80%
stenosis. 2. Arterial conduit angiography demonstrated a widely
patent LIMA-diagonal and SVG-LAD. The SVG-PDA was occluded. 3.
Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left-sided
filling pressures with RVEDP 13mmHg and LVEDP 27mmHg. There was
mild pulmonary Arterial systemic hypertension with PASP 30mmHg.
The cardiac index was preserved at 2.2 L/min/m2. The systemic
and pulmonary vascular Resistances were normal at 1300 and 100
dynes-sec/cm5, respectively. 4. There was critical aortic
stenosis with a calculated valve area of 0.52cm2 and a mean
gradient of 58.7mmHg.
[**2134-2-12**] Carotid Ultrasounds: Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA
stenosis <40%.
[**2134-2-12**] CT Chest: 1. Extensive coronary artery and aortic
valvular calcifications. Mild calcifications of the aortic arch
and descending aorta. 2. Numerous calcified nodules bilaterally
which are not concerning in appearance and most consistent with
prior granulomatous exposure. 3. Hyperdense gallbladder,
attributed either to numerous tiny calcified gallstones versus
gallbladder sludge versus vicarious excretion of contrast into
the gallbladder from a prior intravenous contrast load.

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
The left atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler.
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic
valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2).
Mild to moderate ([**1-24**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.
Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results on Mr.[**Known lastname 986**]
before surgical incision.
POST-BYPASS:
Preserved biventricular systolic function.
LVEF 55%.
Intact thoracic aorta.
The aortic bioprosthesis is stable and functioning well with a m
ean gradient of 11 mm of Hg.
Mild MR.

TWO VIEW CHEST [**2134-2-19**]:

COMPARISON: [**2134-2-17**].

FINDINGS: The patient is status post median sternotomy, coronary
bypass
surgery, and aortic valve replacement. Cardiomediastinal
contours are stable
compared to the prior postoperative radiograph. Small pleural
effusions have
slightly increased in size and are accompanied by adjacent areas
of patchy and
linear atelectasis at both bases. No pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: Slight increase in small pleural effusions with
adjacent basilar
atelectasis.

Brief Hospital Course:
As mentioned in the HPI, this is a 78 year-old male with prior
cardiac history who presented to an outside hospital complaining
of chest pain. He was ruled out for an MI and underwent an echo
which showed severe aortic stenosis. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further evaluation and management. Upon admission he
underwent a cardiac cath which revealed which revealed occluded
native two vessel disease with occluded SVG-PDA and critical
Aortic Stenosis. He underwent extensive pre-operative work-up
and awaited Plavix wash-out prior to surgery. On [**2-16**] he was
brought to the operating room and underwent an Aortic valve
