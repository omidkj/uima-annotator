Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypercarbic respiratory failure and altered mental status.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture.
Intubation.

History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 174**] is a 61 year-old man with history of OSA, HTN,
presenting with altered mental status, found to have hypercarbic
respiratory failure.  He is in the area visiting family.  He has
been feeling 'off' for about a month, with increased
fatigability, shortness of breath.  For about two weeks he had
been waking with worse than normal headache and as if
'hung-over', presently not compliant with CPAP.  He kept falling
asleep at home and noted generally not feeling well.  Marked
hypersomnolence with an episode of falling asleep mid-sentence
on the phone.  According to his family, he had also been leaning
over to the right side when sleepy over the week prior to
presentation.  Family noted weight gain as well.  Two days prior
to presentation he complained of back, leg, and neck pain.  He
states that he ought to have come to medical attention earlier,
but he his generally avoidant of medical attention.  His family
were annoyed from him for not getting help earlier.  Family
repeatedly found him slumped over.  No fevers/chills no recent
respiratory tract infections.

Brought to [**Location (un) 620**], noted to be altered and with respiratory
distress.  pCO2 120 on ABG with low pO2.  Intubated.  Got
levoflox for pneumonia.  CT head with findings somewhat
concerning for SAH (later found to be misread).  Did have an
episode of SBP 80, responding to fluids.  Transferred for
neurosurgical eval.

In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial vs were: T P84 BP 112/80 R18 100%.
Patient was given fent/midaz, solumedrol 125, ceftriaxone,
flagyl, pantoprazole.  CTA performed with no evidence of
aneurysm.  Neurosurgery did not feel this was c/w SAH.  LP
performed; tube 1 with 925 rbcs (no xanthrochromia), tube 4 with
305 rbcs.  Discussed with neurosurg ([**Doctor Last Name **]) and picture thought
not c/w SAH.  Also noted to have ECG changes - <1 mm STE
inferiorly.  ECGs discussed with cards, who did not feel c/w
STEMI.  Trops 0.05-> 0.08.  Did get ASA here.  Admitted to MICU
for hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Past Medical History:
- OSA - does not wear mask he was prescribed
- HTN
- hypercholesterolemia
- osteoporosis
- s/p hernia repair (approx 10 years ago)
- dental infections (approx [**2117-7-7**]), including mandibular

~ 100 pack year history
- Alcohol: rare
- Illicits: none (per cousin)
- Retired one year ago

Family History:
Unknown.

Images:

CT Head at [**Location (un) 620**]:
INCREASED ATTENUATION OF THE INTRACRANIAL ARTERIES AND VENOUS
SINUSES QUESTION PRIOR CONTRAST ADMINISTERED.  TO CORRELATE
CLINICALLY. CONSIDER MRI OF THE HEAD AND MR ANGIOGRAM OF THE
HEAD IF THERE IS NO CONTRAST INDICATION FOR BETTER ASSESSMENT OF
THE BRAIN PARENCHYMA FOR FOCAL LESIONS.

CXR at [**Location (un) 620**]:
Status post intubation.  The tip of the endotracheal tube
projects approximately 7 cm above the carina.
Newly occurred is a severe parenchymal opacity that occupies
almost
the entire left hemithorax.  The opacity is associated with
elevation
of the left hemidiaphragm and leftward shift of the mediastinum.
 Both
signs suggest atelectatic volume loss of the left lung.
The predescribed right lower lobe opacities are better seen than
on
the previous examination and still suggest either early
pneumonia or status post aspiration.
The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  No pulmonary
edema.

CTA head: No change from recent [**Location (un) **] CT with persistant high
attenuation along vessels, suggesting retained contrast. Needs
further evaluation with MR as previously recommended. CTA: No
aneurysms or thrombosis. Final read pending reformats.

CXR: 1. Improved aeration of the left lung in comparison to
chest radiograph from [**Hospital 4068**] Hospital two hours prior.
Persistent small left effusion, retrocardiac opacity, and left
perihilar opacity. 2. Persistent right basilar ill-defined
opacity, concerning for infection or aspiration.

MRI head: Findings most consistent with chronic small vessel
infarction,
without characteristic signal pattern suggestive of herpes
encephalitis.
Nevertheless, if this diagnosis is suspected clinically,
presumably, the
patient is already receiving prophylactic acyclovir.
ADDENDUM AND COMMENT: There is mild high T2 signal within the
mastoid sinus complexes as well, likely indicating an ongoing
inflammatory process as well. Finally, regarding the exclusion
of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage, a CT scan is far more
effective than an MRI in addressing this issue. In that regard,
a CT scan was performed yesterday and did not appear to disclose
subarachnoid blood at that time. Also, a CT angiogram, obtained
yesterday as well, is quite useful in the exclusion of an
aneurysm involving the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] and major vascular
tributaries.

EKG: NSR at 93, borderline Rward axis, normal intervals, poor
RWP, 0.5-1mm STE in II, III, aVF; 0.5-1 mm STD in aVL, V6 (ST
changes not present on OSH ECG).

Labs on Discharge:


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 174**] is a 61 year-old man with hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, untreated OSA, one month of increased tiredness,
reduced activity tolerance and shortness of breath, eventually
presenting, at the urging of family, with hypercarbic
respiratory failure and stupor.

[**Hospital 84345**] Hospital Course
Patient presented to [**Location (un) 620**] with respiratory failure, stupor.
For question of subarachnoid hemorrhage was transferred for
Neurosurgical evaluation at [**Hospital1 18**]. Subsequent head CT negative
here. Patient hypercarbic and hypoxic, intubated at [**Location (un) 620**] and
maintained here with low NIFs and difficulty weaning (when
pressure support lowered would become tachypneic). On admission
he also had a NSTEMI. A combination of pumonary parenchymal
processes were clear with less clear contribution of neurologic
causes. Treated for PNA and COPD he improved and despite low
NIFs, respiratory status improved with treatment and the weaning
of sedation. Before leaving the ICU he tolerated oxygenation by
nasal cannula. On presentation to the floor, the patient was
satting above 90% on room air, and thus will not require home
oxygen supplementation. The patient is being discharged home on
CPAP at night, Advair, Tiotropium and Albuterol PRN.  For
