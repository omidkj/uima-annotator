Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Lasix

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 317**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea and lethargy

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiPAP
Arterial line.

History of Present Illness:
95-yo-woman w/ COPD and CHF presents w/ dypsnea and lethargy.
She was feeling well until 2 days ago, when she developed
increasing dyspnea. This has gotten progressively worse until
today, when she had no relief of her dyspnea w/ albuterol nebs,
prompting her to call EMS. She admits to increasing lethargy
over the past few days. Denies any fever, rigors, chest pain,
palpitations, orthopnea, increasing LE edema, leg pain.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, she was tachypnic w/ RR in 30s and O2 sat 75%
on RA --> 99% w/ combivent neb and face mask. ABG was
7.30/94/86/48. CXR revealed signs of pulm edema. She was treated
w/ solumedrol 125 mg IV, azithromycin 500 mg IV, ethacrinic acid
50 mg IV, and combivent neb x 3. She was then placed on BiPAP
and transferred to the MICU for further care.

[**2114-3-26**] LENI:
IMPRESSION:  No evidence of DVT.

ECHO on [**2114-3-27**]:
Conclusions:
The left and right atria are moderately dilated. There is mild
symmetric left  ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
and systolic function  (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Transmitral  Doppler and tissue velocity
imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV  diastolic
dysfunction, and an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated,
but systolic  function is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but  aortic stenosis is not present. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral  valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.  There
is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global
and regional  systolic function. Moderate diastolic LV
dysfunction. Mildly dilated right  ventricle with preserved
systolic function. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.

CXR on [**2114-3-27**]:
HISTORY:  CHF exacerbation, worsening hypoxia.

IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2-7**] and 12 and [**3-26**]:
Small-to-moderate pleural effusions are smaller and
moderate-to-severe
cardiomegaly is stable.  A region of consolidation at the upper
pole of the left hilus is concerning for pneumonia or pulmonary
infarction.  Findings were discussed by telephone with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 75406**] at the time of dictation.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Somnolence: secondary to severe hypercarbia which resolved
with BiPAP and treatment of COPD exacerbation. Unclear
exacerbating factor. No further episodes of somnolence after
discharge from the ICU.
.
2. Dyspnea: combined exacerbation of COPD and decompensated CHF.
 CHF exacerbation likely due to recent change from lasix/bumex
to ethacrynic acid last month.  Baseline oxygen saturation
88-92%.  She had negative LENIs.  Diuretics initially held
secondary to renal insufficiency but ultimately restarted at
discharge.
.
3.  Thrombocytopenia:  history of dropping to 36, but put on
Heparin in the ICU.  Heparin discontinued with improvement in
her platelet count. On coumadin for Atrial fibrillation.
.
4.  Atrial fibrillation: paroxysmal, rate controlled with
diltiazem.  Restarted on coumadin.  Required diltiazem drip in
the ICU for RVR.  Discontinued nifedipine for hypertension to
make room for increased diltiazem dose.
.
5.  Anemia: baseline HCT 27-30 from chronic inflammation.
.
6.  Renal failure: pre-renal given diuresis in ICU. Restarted
ethacrynic acid at discharge.
