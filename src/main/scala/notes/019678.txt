sided chest pain. The patient has multiple recent admissions for
CHF exacerbation.
.
Recently she had been gaining weight at home (documented by VNA)
with increased dyspnea on exertion. She had been directed to
increase her home lasix dose but had not taken lasix for 2 days
because her landlord is fixing her bathroom; she would have to
walk to her neighbors to use their bathroom but is unable due to
severe dyspnea on exertion. The day prior to admission she

prior to admission she stayed with other family and did not
bring her CPAP machine with her. Her dyspnea became
progressively worse and she called EMS. She also had transient
left-sided non-radiating chest pain that lasted a few seconds
and was worse with deep breathing.
.
In the ED, vitals notable for HR 100s and SBP as high as 260s.
She was placed on CPAP and diuresed with 40mg IV lasix resulting
in 1L urine output. A nitro gtt was started and her BP improved
to 140/90s. ECG showed sinus tachycardiac with lateral ST
depressions. TnT 0.06 (patient has baseline elevations) and CK
175 with MB 9. BNP was 3945. She also received ASA and
lisinopril.

Pertinent Results:
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2176-10-19**]  9:40:18 AM


Sinus bradycardia. Probable left ventricular hypertrophy with
secondary repolarization abnormalities. Q-T interval prolonged
for rate.
Non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities. Compared to prior tracing

earlier on [**2176-10-18**] the heart rate has decreased further. Atrial

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)  [**2176-10-19**] 7:45 AM

CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

Reason: Interval change

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
55 year old woman with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, DM, a/w CHF
exacerbation.
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Interval change
SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST.

REASON FOR EXAM: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. CHF exacerbation.

Comparison is made with prior study performed a day before.

Marked cardiomegaly is unchanged. Allowing the technique that is
limited due to patient body habitus, there has been no interval
change in moderate pulmonary edema. There is no pneumothorax or
sizeable pleural effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the CCU for management.  On Admit,
impression was for CHF exacerbation and respiratory fatigue in
setting of not taking her lasix dose for 3 days and not using at
home BiPap overnight.
.
#CHF: Patient diuresed well with repeat dose of lasix 40 IV x2
on admit (Net out 1.7L).  UOP subsequently dropped off and Cr
bumped, and patient was given 500cc bolus over 1 hour to improve
intravascular volume.  Patient was continued on ACE-I and
beta-blocker and with subsequent improvement in her pulmonary
function with diuresis over the next 3 days.
.
#HTN: Patient was hypertensive on presentation - received 40
lisinopril in ED.  Was continued on toprol for HTN and CHF.
With 100mg Toprol and diuresis patient became hypotensive to
90's, and toprol dose was decreased to 50mg daily.  Patient
ultimately hypertensive again prior to discharge with SBP 140's
to as high 170's, but with HR in 50's at rest.  Amlodipine 5mg
was added for improved BP control and patient was discharged on
toprol 50mg, amlodipine 5mg and lisinopril 40mg.
.
#Pulmonary: Admitted on Non-rebreather.  Patient with adequate
gases on day of admission.  Was kept on BiPap overnight, and
then weaned to nasal cannula in AM.  By discharge patient was
oxygenating > 90% at rest on room air, but as previously would
desat with exertion.  Was discharged on home O2 for exertion
with CPAP overnight as per respiratory's recommendations.
.
#A. Fib: Patient was in sinus rhythm for hospital stay.  She was
continued on amiodarone at her at home dose.  Coumadin was
therapeutic on admission, but had to be held x1 for
supratherapeutic INR.  Was discharged at a reduced dose with
plans to follow-up with coumadin clinic.
.
#Nutrition and Social Work counseling were provided.  Social
work arranged for patient to have bedside commode on discharge
to facilitate bathroom breaks.
.
The remainder of the patient's hospitalization was uneventful.
She was discharged home with outpatient follow-up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 696**], and her PCP.
