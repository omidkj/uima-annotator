Dyspnea, hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
74 y/o female with a h/o MMP who was recently diagnosed with
non-small cell lung CA who was scheduled for cycle 2 of
carboplatin/taxol (cycle 1 on [**12-4**]) when she presented on [**2167-12-27**]
with worsening SOB X 2 weeks. Per patient, has had increased DOE
since late [**Month (only) 1096**]. Usually walks one hour, but now can only
walk 40 min and feels more SOB than normal. + orthopnea, no PND,
no LE edema. She was seen in clinic for a scheduled visit to
start second cycle of chemo on [**12-28**] and was found to have O2 sats
of 78% with aggressive ambulation. She felt more SOB during this
episode than usual, but not as badly as prior CHF exacerbations.
She was sent down for imaging and CTA was negative and she went
home with O2. That evening she was sipping tea and choked (has
been choking on liquids since thyroid CA in [**2110**]'s). The next
day she presented to ED with worsening SOB that was now
occurring at rest but denied CP, fevers, chills, change in
cough, or sputum production. In the ED, the patient's O2 sat was
93% on a NRB. CXR demonstrated RLL PNA and she was treated for a
pneumonia and presumed CHF. She received ceftaz, azithromycin,
lasix (680cc diuresed) and morphine. She was also started on
BiPAP for presumed CHF exacerbation which helped. She was
transferred to the MICU where she improved daily and the team
felt that the largest contributor to acute SOB was PNA. An ECHO
was obtained in setting of CABG and AVR which was unchanged from
[**2-26**] except from increasing pulm HTN (possibly likely
combination of lung CA, diphragmatic paralysis, h/o XRT when
tx'd for thyroid CA). She is being tranferred to the OMED
service because shy in no longer MICU level of care. She was
sating high 90's on [**1-24**] L upon transfer.
.
Currently the patient's breathing is comfortable and she denies
CP, palpatations. Cough is improving, nonproductive. No URI sxs.
Has been eating a lower sodium diet and taking all of her
medications regularly. She has had an 8 lb weight loss in 2
months d/t decreased appetite. Also had myalgias as well as
numbness/tinging in toes, feet, hands, knees, calves during
neulasta treatment, all currently resolved.
.
ROS: No fatigue, malaise, fevers, chills, N/V/abd
pain/D/C/dysuria/sensory or motor loss. + nose bleed during
chemo.

.
CXR [**2167-12-27**]
Interval development of poorly defined opacities in the lungs
bilaterally, most consistent with pneumonia. Acute chemotherapy
reaction could have a similar appearance.
.
CXR [**2167-12-28**]
Bilateral basilar infiltrates, suggesting pneumonia.
.
TTE [**2167-12-28**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is symmetric left
ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Left
ventricular
systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The gradient
increased with the Valsalva manuever. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**11-24**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
a small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2167-2-25**],
estimated
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now higher.


Brief Hospital Course:
74 y/o female with a h/o MMP who was recently diagnosed with
non-small cell lung CA who was scheduled for cycle 2 of
carboplatin/taxol (cycle 1 on [**12-4**]) when she presented on [**2167-12-27**]
with worsening SOB X 2 weeks. The following issues were
addressed during this hospitalization.
.
1. SOB
Pt was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for respiratory monitoring
given her hypoxia and worsening SOB.
ICU course:
Initially presented with hypoxic respiratory failure. Etiology
appeared to be multifactorial including possible RLL PNA, LUL
mass (malignancy) and an elevated L hemidiaphragm suggestive of
phrenic nerve involvement. She was started on Unasyn. Given
progression of lung CA she may be O2 dependent. Her hypertension
was controlled with home atenolol and cozaar. Her anemia was
deemed [**12-25**] chronic disease and iron deficiency and she was
started on iron supplementation. She continued synthroid.
.
OMED Floor Course
Pt was transferred to OMED when stable from a respiratory
standpoint. She was continued on Unasyn for presumed aspiration
PNA and switched to liquid Augmentin to complete her ABx course.
Pulmonary was consulted given her initial worsening of SOB and
increased pulmonary HTN on TTE. The most likely etiology for the
pt's presentation was an acute on chronic pulmonary process. She
had described SOB since [**7-28**] which progressively became worse.
She had a documented aspiration event which was the etiology of
her acute presentation, most likely aspiration pneumonitis but
was treated for aspiration PNA. The pulmonary HTN was most
likely the result of her known valvular heart disease which
progressed in the setting of her carcinoma. She will follow up
with pulmonology upon discharge. She was discharged home on
oxygen therapy.
.
2. HTN
Pt was maintained during most of her hospital admission on her
home dose of atenolol and cozaar. After discussion with her
outpatient cardiologist, he recommended metoprolol TID, no
diuretic therapy (pt with h/o hypotensive episodes while on
diuretic therapy) and continuing Cozaar.
