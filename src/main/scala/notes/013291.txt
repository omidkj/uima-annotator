History of Present Illness:
70 yr old female admit from OSH with high grade SBO with chronic
parastomal hernia.  She was admitted with abdominal pain and no
ostomy output. Upon arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] she was stable, she stated
that her abdominal pain started 3 days prior to her presentation
at the OSH. She c/o nausea, emesis but she denied  f/c/SOB/CP/
bright red blood stool from ostomy or any urinary symptoms.
However she acknowledged a decrease in her ostomy output over
the
last 3 days. patient reports previous episodes of SBO and has
been treated conservatively at [**Hospital1 2025**].
During our interview She had about 30 cc of watery brown stool
from her stoma which was last change the day prior.

[**2188-9-1**] Gastrograffin enema
1. Small colonic diverticulum.
2. Filling defect within the pouch likely retained material.
Correlation
with physical exam is recommended.
3. No evidence of leak or fistula within the pouch or the colon.

4. No evidence of obstruction or parastomal hernia.

[**2188-9-3**] Cardiac echo :
The left atrium is markedly dilated. The left atrium is
elongated. Moderate to severe spontaneous echo contrast is seen
in the body of the left atrium. The right atrium is moderately
dilated. A mass/thrombus associated with a catheter/pacing wire
is seen in the right atrium. A patent foramen ovale is present.
A left-to-right shunt across the interatrial septum is seen at
rest. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular free wall
thickness is normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly
dilated with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.

[**2188-9-10**] CT Abd/pelvis :
1. 4.1 cm fluid collection adjacent to the anastomosis. This
does have an
enhancing rim and may represent an abscess.
2. Large fluid collection in the anterior abdominal wall
immediately
underneath the surgical staples, this contains a large amount of
air, but has no enhancing rim, and thus is more consistent with
a seroma; however,
infection cannot be excluded.
3. Partial small-bowel obstruction, with contrast reaching the
ascending
colon.
4. Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the left and small
on the right with adjacent atelectasis of the lower lobes.
5. Right renal artery stenosis with atrophic right kidney.

[**2188-9-12**] Duplex scan right upper extremity :
Extensive deep vein thrombosis seen within the right brachial,
axillary, and subclavian veins.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated by the Acute Care team in the Emergency
Room and scans were reviewed  She had a high grade  SBO and
incarcerated parastomal hernia, and most likely infected mesh.
She was admitted to the SICU due to her multiple comorbidiities.
 She was NPO with a nasogastric tube in place for decompression
and she was hydrated with IV fluids.  Her nasogastric tube
continued to drain large amounts of feculent smelling drainage
and surgery was recommended once her INR decreased.

On [**2188-9-3**] she was taken to the Operating Room and underwent an
exploratory laparotomy, removal of infected mesh, hernia repair
and Hartmann's reversal.  She had some hemodynamic instability
on induction then required pressors intermittently.  Following
return to the SICU her pressors were gradually weaned off  and
that was possible after her atrial fibrillation rate was
controlled.  She was extubated on [**2188-9-4**] and underwent vigorous
pulmonary toilet including nebulizers and chest PT and remained
free of any pulmonary complications post op. Her anticoagulation
was started on post op day 2 with a goal PTT of 50-60 then as
she became further out from surgery she was titrated to 60-80
range.

As she continued to improve she was transferred out to the
Surgical floor on [**2188-9-6**]. Her
