Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 52 year old female with a past medical history of
asthma who presented to the ED with cough and worsening SOB x 1
day.  She states that she woke up this morning with SOB and had
a fever to 101 at home.  Per her report, she had similar
symptoms in [**2167**] requiring intubation for multifocal pneumonia.
She felt increasingly SOB with associated lightheadedness.
.
On arrival to the ED, initial vitals were 98.8 104 171/83 28 93%
15L.  She was placed on a nonrebreather.  CXR showed multifocal
pneumonia.  She was given a dose of levofloxacin, 125
solumedrol, duonebs x 3.
.
On arrival to the MICU,  patient states she is much more
comfortable satting 93% on 5L NC, RR in the 20s.

IMAGING:
[**2169-7-26**] CXR: Confluent consolidation is seen in the right lower
and left lower lungs concerning for pneumonia. No large
effusions are seen. No pneumothorax. Heart size appears normal
limits of size. Mediastinal contour is normal. Bony structures
are intact.
IMPRESSION: Consolidation in the lower lungs, right greater than
left,
concerning for pneumonia. Recommend followup to resolution.
.
[**2169-7-29**] CXR: Worsening hypoxemia, patient is after diuresis.
Comparison is made with prior study performed 12 hours earlier.
Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are unchanged.  Diffuse
opacities, worse in the lower lobe are unchanged, suggesting
that these abnormalities likely represent pneumonia and less
likely pulmonary edema.  There are no new lung abnormalities,
pneumothorax, or large pleural effusions.
.
[**2169-7-30**] CXR: Again seen is moderate cardiomegaly and diffuse
bilateral patchy alveolar infiltrates.  The pulmonary
vasculature is ill-defined.  It is unclear how much of this
represents underlying infectious infiltrate and how much is
pulmonary edema.  Compared to the prior study, the pulmonary
status is slightly worse.
.
[**2169-7-27**] Left leg LENI: No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in
the left lower extremity. Peroneal veins are not visualized.

TTE:
The left atrium is normal in size. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). with normal
free wall contractility. The aortic root is mildly dilated at
the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. There is
no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. There is an
anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad.


IMPRESSION: Sub-optimal. Normal left ventricular cavity size
with moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and
preserved global left ventricular systolic function. Mildly
dilated aortic root and ascending aorta. Indeterminate pulmonary
artery systolic pressure.

Brief Hospital Course:
52 year old woman with a history of morbid obesity, asthma (no
PFTs in OMR), and pneumonia requiring intubation in [**2167**], who
presented initially with cough, SOB, and fever to 101, who was
admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and treated for
CAP, asthma exacerbation, and pulmonary edema.

# Community-Acquired Pneumonia: Patient with fever, SOB,
tachypnea, and evidence of multifocal pneumonia on CXR. She was
initially treated with levofloxacin for CAP, and vancomycin was
later added due to bacteremia (see below); later determined to
be a contaminant. She also had significant wheezing suggesting
an asthma exacerbation, which was treated (see below).  She also
had signs of volume overload and pulmonary edema, which was
treated (see below).  She did have asymmetric leg swelling L>R
on admission, but LENI was negative for DVT.  Initially her CXR
worsened on [**7-29**] and [**7-30**], so her antibiotics were broadened to
include cefepime.  However, because of well-appearance,
non-labored breathing, and the absence of recent healthcare
contacts, her [**Name2 (NI) 621**] were re-narrowed to levofloxacin and she
completed a 7 day course ([**7-27**]->[**8-2**]).
.
#Asthma/?COPD: The patient has a history of asthma with multiple
admissions (last in [**2166**]); takes ventolin PRN, but never been on
a controller medication.  No PFTs on record; given her
significant smoking history, she may have COPD vs. asthma. Given
her history of asthma, she was treated initially with
methylprednisolone 125mg IV Q8h, as well as continuous, then Q2h
duonebs. She was able to be weaned down on her steroids and
nebulizers with a decreasing O2 requirement. She was also
transitioned PO prednisone 60 mg after 3 days of IV solumedrol
