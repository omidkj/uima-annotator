HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 70-year-old
male who presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital five days prior to
admission at Byte [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].  He stated
he had several weeks of exertional and rest angina responsive
to sublingual Nitroglycerin which he had been taking
approximately every other day.  On the day of admission to
[**Hospital **] Hospital he awoke with 10/10 chest pain which
initially was relieved with two sublingual Nitroglycerin but
then returned and was unresponsive to a third Nitroglycerin.
He was brought to the [**Hospital **] Hospital Emergency Room and was
treated with Morphine, Heparin and Intactly and ruled out for
an myocardial infarction.  He underwent an Adenosine Myoview
which was negative for chest pain but positive for dyspnea
and lateral ST changes and showed a posterior lateral
reversible defect and a fixed anterior defect.  He also had
an echocardiogram which showed an EF of 50% with mild mitral
regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation.  He was then
transferred to Byte [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] for
cardiac catheterization.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Shows an elderly male lying on a
stretcher in no acute distress.  His skin is warm, dry and
intact.  Vital signs includes a heart rate of 78, blood
pressure 124/65, respirations 20 with an O2 sat of 100% on
two liters nasal cannula.  His head, eyes, ears, nose and
throat shows pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light
and accommodation, extraocular movements intact.  His pharynx
is clear.  Neck is supple with no jugular venous distention
and no bruits.  His lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  His heart is regular rate and rhythm with no
murmur, rub or gallop.  He has an old sternotomy scar which
is well healed.  His abdomen is obese, he has positive bowel
sounds, he is nontender, nondistended with no
hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities:  No clubbing or cyanosis,
he does have 3+ edema on the right and 4+ on the left.  His
dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are Dopplerable
bilaterally and his right and left  femoral arteries are
without baseline bruits.

LABORATORY:  White count of 5.3, hematocrit 28.3, platelets
576,000.  His Protime is 13.3, INR 1.2, his sodium 132,
potassium 4.1, chloride 101, Co2 23, BUN 27, creatinine .8
and a blood glucose of 147.  His LFTs include an ALT of 44,
AST 16, LDH 43, alk phos 21, total bili .1 and albumin of .6.

His chest x-ray on admission shows cardiomegaly with
pulmonary vasculature is prominent suggesting failure.  He
does have bullous changes in his right lung apex.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of admission the patient
underwent cardiac catheterization which showed elevated left
filling pressures, capillary wedge pressure of 30, his left
main was normal.  His left anterior descending showed diffuse
60% disease proximally with 100% disease mid-vessel.  His
left circumflex shows a 100% stenosis proximally.  Distal
left circ to OM fills via the left to left collaterals.  His
right coronary artery has known occluded proximal distal
vessels from his mammary artery, his saphenous vein graft to
the first diagonal was occluded.  The saphenous vein graft to
the OM 1 is known to be occluded.  The saphenous vein graft
to the patent ductus arteriosus is occluded.  Left internal
mammary artery to the left anterior descending is widely
patent.  The left anterior descending has moderate diffuse
disease distally and supplies collaterals to the right.

Given this information he was considered to be a possible
candidate for coronary artery bypass graft and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1537**] was
consulted.  Also an intra-aortic pump was placed.  Upon
seeing the patient it was felt that he would be a candidate
for surgery which was scheduled for the following morning.
On [**2142-8-21**] the patient underwent coronary artery bypass
grafting times three with a reduced sternotomy that included
saphenous vein graft to the OM, saphenous vein graft to the
diagonal and a saphenous vein graft to the posterior left
ventricular branch.

He had surgery performed under general endotracheal
anesthesia.  Cardiopulmonary bypass time was 166 minutes with
a cross clamp time of 137 minutes.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well, was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit in
normal sinus rhythm.  Dobutamine, Levophed, Insulin and
Propofol drips with two atrial and two ventricular pacing
wires. Intra-aortic balloon pump and two mediastinal and one
left pleural chest tube.  Upon arrival in the Intensive Care
Unit it was noted that he was acidotic and this was corrected
through ventilatory changes.  He was also noted to have
minimal urine output and his Foley was changed and there was
improvement in his urine output following.

By the first postoperative day he had improved slightly and
was somewhat more hemodynamically stable therefore, his
intra-aortic pump was discontinued.  Also on this date his
Dobutamine was weaned to off and attempts at weaning off his
Levophed drip.  By the second postoperative day he continued
to require Lasix to assist with his urine output and while
trying to diurese him attempts were made to begin ventilatory
wean.  By postop day four, he was noted to be in atrial
fibrillation and received bolus of Amiodarone and was
eventually started on the Amiodarone drip.  He did eventually
convert to normal sinus rhythm and was continued on the
Amiodarone drip while intubated.

By postop day five he had tolerated multiple hours at CPAP
and his pressure support was being weaned.  He did undergo a
bronchoscopy at the bedside which showed minimal secretions
and no plugs.  At this point he was receiving intermittent
doses of diuretic with Lasix and continued in normal sinus
rhythm.

By postop day eight, he was ready for extubation and was
extubated successfully.  He had undergone a renal ultrasound
because his creatinine had bumped to a peak of 1.9 despite
the fact that he continued to make urine while on Lasix drip.
A renal ultrasound showed a positive flow bilaterally with
his left kidney being moderately greater in size than the
right but it was otherwise normal.  Also on this date was
noted to have further episodes of A-fib and A-flutter and was
started on Lopressor and started on Diltiazem drip and
continued on the Amiodarone.  He continued to receive
aggressive diuresis and pulmonary toilet.

On postop day nine he did have his cortise changed to a
triple lumen and cortise was sent for culture.  This
eventually came back as staph coag negative and sputum he had
sent off around that time was also positive for Methicillin
resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  He did have an ID consult
because previous blood cultures were shown to be positive
also including in addition to the staph coag negative,
Serratia.  Another blood culture from an A-line previously on
[**8-25**] showed Klebsiella and Serratia all sensitive to
Levaquin. He ha
