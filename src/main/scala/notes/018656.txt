PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Acutely ischemic right lower
extremity.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Acutely ischemic right lower
extremity.

PROCEDURE:
1. Right groin exploration with aortobifemoral graft
    thrombectomy and femoropopliteal and tibial
    thromboembolectomies.
2. Right lower extremity arteriography.
3. Right four-compartment fasciotomies.

ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal.

INDICATIONS:  The patient is a 68-year-old male with a
previous history of a femoral-femoral bypass and aortofemoral
bypass graft in [**2136**].  He had no known active problems with
claudication but within the past twelve hours he has had a
recent emergency room evaluation for anaphylaxis.  She
subsequently then signed himself out AMA and was found
intoxicated and down near his home.  When he arrived again at
the emergency room, he had a cold, pulseless right leg.  He
was heparinized and brought to [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **] emergently.

FINDINGS:  The aortofemoral graft was full of thrombus
proximally, as was the common femoral, superficial femoral
through the popliteal and into the tibial vessels.  This was
quite a large clot burden.  His aortofemoral graft plugs
directly
into the right superficial artery and the origin of the profunda
is chronically occluded.  The native CFA looks to have been
replaced with the ABF limb.

After completing two thrombectomies,
we performed an arteriogram which showed residual clot in the
popliteal and re-thrombectomized the tibioperoneal trunk and
tibials with a much improved result and better foot
perfusion.

OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  After informed consent, the patient was
brought to the operating room and positioned supine on the
operating table.  The entire right leg and both groins were
sterilly prepped and draped.  A vertical skin incision was
made over his previous groin incisions.  There was dense scar
but careful dissection was carried out to control his right
aortofemoral graft limb, which appears to have been
completely replaced the original common femoral artery.  The
graft then went directly into the superficial femoral artery.
A longitudinal graftotomy was performed near the distal
anastomosis and on inspecting this, there was a fresh clot
within.  We performed a #5 [**Doctor Last Name **] proximal
thromboembolectomy with resulting good inflow.  Next, we
performed distal thrombectomies using 3 and 4 [**Doctor Last Name **]
catheters.  There was no evidence of any profunda orifice
during the intial thrombectomy.  After getting good back-
bleeding from the superficial femoral artery, we restored
flow and performed an arteriogram.

Arteriography showed no problems with the aortofemoral graft
and good flow through the proximal SFA.  Upon late films, the
profunda femoris could be seen reconstituted retrograde via
numerous circumflexfemoral collaterals.  The lower
arteriographic
images showed patent popliteal arteries.  Below the knee,
there was a high takeoff of the posterior tibial artery and
there was residual thrombus in the tibioperoneal trunk and
proximal anterior tibial and peroneal arteries.  There was no
flow down beyond the lower calf.

We decided to reopen the graftotomy and redo the
tibioperoneal embolectomies using a 3-[**Doctor Last Name **] catheter.
Doing this, we retrieved a large amount of additional clot
from the tibial vessels.  The back-bleeding again was very
good.  We again closed the graftotomy and performed an
arteriogram which showed restoration of flow through the
posterior tibial and anterior tibial arteries.  The foot was
perfused at this point and we concluded our
revascularization.

Next, attention was turned towards the fasciotomies which
were performed via medial and lateral incisions.  All four
compartments were released.  The muscles were pink, healthy
and all contracted to electrocautery stimulation.

At the end of the case the patient had easily palpable
dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial and peroneal signals.  The
fasciotomies were dressed with VAC dressings.  The wound was
closed in layers with deep running Vicryl sutures and 3-0
nylons in the skin.

The patient tolerated the procedure well.  All sponge and
instrument counts were correct at the end of the case.  He
was transferred to the intensive care unit in stable
condition.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 68-year-old male was found intoxicated and down
near his home.  When he arrived again at the emergency room, he
had a cold, pulseless right leg.  He
was heparinized and brought to [**Hospital1 **] [**Hospital1 **] emergently. Patient
was taken to the OR for emergent right groin exploration.  The
aortofemoral graft was full of thrombus
proximally, as was the common femoral, superficial femoral
through the popliteal and into the tibial vessels.  This was
quite a large clot burden.  His aortofemoral graft plugs
directly into the right superficial artery and the origin of the
profunda
is chronically occluded. The native CFA looks to have been
replaced with the ABF limb. A Aortobifemoral graft thrombectomy
and femoropopliteal and tibial thromboembolectomies were
performed and right four-compartment fasciotomies. A VAC was
placed over the medial and lateral fasciotomy sites.  After
completing two thrombectomies, we performed an arteriogram which
showed residual clot in the popliteal and re-thrombectomized the
tibioperoneal trunk and tibials with a much improved result and
better foot perfusion.

He had been fine since the surgery but on POD3 he became
agitated and assaultive this am during dressing change. Was
screaming and swearing at the same time. Nursing also noticed
that the pt might have
