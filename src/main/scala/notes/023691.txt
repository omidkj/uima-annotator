Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Cephalexin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
bradycardia, hypotension, during bronchoscopy, then with ST
elevations and increasing troponin after epinephrine
administration during resuscitation

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
aborted rigid bronchoscopy [**2164-1-5**]


History of Present Illness:
67 y/o Russian-speaking F with PMH of metastatic renal cell ca
with a h/o ST elevations during a similar tumor debulking
procedure in [**12-1**]. The [**Month (only) **] procedure was aborted [**2-28**]
hypotension and bradycardia--the patient was taken emergently to
the cath lab where she was found to have 100% clean coronaries,
but had troponin elevation related to coronary artery vasospasm.
Now admitted today [**1-5**] again for rigid bronch for tumor
debulking. As the bronchoscopy was undertaken, the scope was
advanced into the LUL which was found to be completely
obstructed by tumor. As the Argon Plasma Coagulator was
activated, the patient became bradycardic to the 40's,
hypotensive with SBP of 40. Did not respond to atropine, neo,
phenylephrine and therefore was given 200 mcg of epi and became
HTN. The procedure was aborted and the patient was taken to the
PACU, slowly weaned off neo, was extubated, but still was tachy
to 140's. EKG's done in the OR and PACU with diffuse ST
elevations in leads V3-V6.

Past Medical History:
1. Renal cell carcinoma, clear cell, diagnosed [**1-27**], status post
left nephrectomy and left lower lobe resection
2. Status post TAH, uterine prolapse repair
3. Hyperlipidemia


Social History:
married, denies smoking or alcohol use

Family History:
non-contributory

Physical Exam:
PE: 96.7, pc 125, bpc 117/80, resp 22, 99% 100% shovel mask
Gen: sitting in bed, NAD
HEENT: dark glasses, no JVD, MMM
Cardiac: tachy, regular, no M/R
Pulm: mild wheezing anterior, coarase breath sounds at left
Abd: NABS, soft, NT/ND
Ext: warm without edema


Pertinent Results:
CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  [**2164-1-6**] 11:18 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval worsening of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy;
persistent postobstructive collapse of the left upper lobe. Mass
effect upon the SVC and right middle lobe bronchus are evident
as well.
2. Subsegmental pulmonary embolus within a right lower lobe
anterior pulmonary artery branch. This finding was communicated
to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 2:00pm.
3. Interval increase in size of left lower lobe mass.
4. Interval increase in size of mass within the left nephrectomy
bed.
5. Stable appearance of hypervascular metastatic focus within
the right lobe of the liver.
6. New small pericardial effusion.

Brief Hospital Course:
67 y/o F with metastatic renal cell ca, with bradycardia during
debulking, hypotension, and recurrent ST elevations / coronary
vasospasm.

1. Metastatic RCC with LUL collapse [**2-28**] compression: Tumor
progression since last month and pt seems unable to tolerate
debulking procedure. Repeat CT chest performed on [**2164-1-6**]
showed progression of disease burden and incidental finding of a
subsegmental RML PE. Heparin IV started, head CT with IV
contrast did not show any evidence of brain metastesis, and the
patient was transitioned to coumadin. However, given evidence of
small but enlarging pericardial effusion on TTE, anticoagulation
was discontinued prior to discharge given concern for high risk
of bleeding into a potentially malignant effusion. Her
outpatient oncologist followed her throughout the course of her
admission; he reported that there was no systemic therapy left
that would likely alter the course of her disease. He
recommended that she be evaluated by radiotherapy to determine
whether collapse of the left lung and obstruction of the SVC
could be forstalled by radiation. She was evaluated while
in-house by the radiation oncology team, with whom she will
follow-up as an outpatient.

2. Cardiac: Inferior ST elevations seen on EKG following
administration of epinephrine for bradycardia and hypotension.
CE positive, likely reflecting coronary vasospasm post
epinephrine, with peak trop at 0.48 on [**2164-1-6**]. Cardiology was
consulted on [**2164-1-5**] and the patient was started on a
nicardipine drip to treat coronary vasospasm. On [**2164-1-6**], per
cardiology, patient started on ASA, CCB PO, Lisinopril and
statin. Beta blocker was held to allow for reflex tachycardia in
setting of PE.
