Brief Hospital Course:
Overall course:

From the [**Name (NI) **] pt was transferred to the ICU. Zosyn was started to
cover presumed soft-tissue infection, UTI and possibly
aspiration PNA, and vancomycin was started since he is a nursing
home resident. Patient had altered mental status on baseline
dementia. Patient was intubated for 7 days for hypercarbic resp
failure.  He self-extubated and did well off the ventilator,
oxygenating well on a NRB.  Abx for pna and UTI were stopped
[**10-25**].  Prednisone has gradually been tapered for relative
adrenal insufficiency.  While pt was intubated he was
bradycardic to the 30s and 40s but his BP was stable.  After
extubation, his heart rate increased to the 140s, worse with
agitation.  He was eventually started on a diltiazem drip to
control his heart rate and then transitioned to po metoprolol.
He was called out to the floor on HD# 11.
.
On the floor, pt was doing well but his heart rate remained in
the 90s-120s.  This am, his dose of lopressor was increased from
25mg tid to 50mg tid.  He received one dose of 50mg in the am.
Around 2pm, pt was noted to be having more pauses, asx.  Pauses
became longer and then pt had multiple 5-second pauses.  After a
very long pause, pt was found to be ashen and unresponsive with
no blood pressure although he did have a pulse.  O2 sat on 2L
was 40%, on NRB, O2 sat rose to the 90s.  ABG showed 7.28/77/72
on NRB.  With oxygen, pt became more responsive and BP improved
to 150s.  Pt was suctioned with minimal secretions.  Pt was then
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring. He did well and
was transferred back to the floor after several days. There, he
remained slightly agitated and disoriented. He pulled out his
central line and continually pulled off his telemetry leads.
.
Discussions with dtr, HCP, talked about pt's poor prognosis and
the decision was made to not replace the central line and make
pt DNR/DNI.
.
Specific problems:
1. [**Name2 (NI) 111304**]:  While pt was intubated in the ICU he remained
bradycardic to the 30s (with normal blood pressure).  The
patient returned to A.Fib with AVR when extubated.  He was
controlled on Diltiazem and switched to Metoprolol with good
control.  On the floor, pt had several episodes of bradycardia
and [**2-23**] second pauses.  One of the these pauses led to symptoms
and pt was transferred to the ICU.  The pauses are usually
followed tachycardia to the 110s.  This is most characteristic
with tachy-brady syndrome.  The patient experienced very rare,
short lived episodes of bradycardia while on the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].  Atropine
was kept at the bedside but was not needed. Given his overall
clinical status, he was not considered a candidate for
pacemaker. He found the telemetry leads very irritating and
repeatedly removed them. Decision was made to make him DNR/DNI
and further cardiac monitoring was not pursued.
.
2. Hypoxia: The patient presented with pneumonia.  His family
requested that he be intubated if necessary.  He was intubated
and sent to the ICU.  He was treated with 10 days of vanc/zosyn
for aspiration pneumonia (finishing on [**10-25**]) and was agressively
diuresed.  He was started on steroids for relative adrenal
insufficiency, and then completed a Prednisone taper.  He
self-extubated on [**10-23**] and maintained good O2 sats on shovel
mask.  On the floor, he became hypoxic with bradycardic episode.
When he returned to the unit he was placed on BIPAP.  His
continued oxygen requirement was attributed to COPD and volume
overload.  His baseline COPD was treated with nebs.
*
3. Leukocytosis: On initial presentation pt had an elevated WBC
associated with likely pna sepsis. This trended down after
treatment with antibiotics. He was ruled out for c.diff with 3
negative stool cultures. On day of discharge WBC count was nml
at 8.4.
.
4. Decubitus ulcer:  The patient had a decubitus ulcer that was
evaluated by Plastics.  They followed the patient daily and
debrided the ulcer. The patient was started on Zosyn for empiric
coverage of soft-tissue infection and received a full course of
this.  Swab wound culture positive for Proteus and MSSA.
Zinc, vitamin C, and dressing changes were continued. At rehab
these dressing changes should continue with debridements q1-2
weeks. He should follow up with plastics in [**1-24**] weeks.
.
5. Dementia: His remeron was continued.  Once extubated he
became very agitated at night.  Morphine, ativan, and haldol
were tried without effect.  Finally zyprexa was found to relieve
his agitation and was given prn.
.
6. Hypernatremia: the pt was noted to have Na's as
