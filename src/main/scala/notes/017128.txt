Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for further management of acute renal failure,
liver failure, anasarca, and hypothermia


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and mechanical ventilation

History of Present Illness:
80-year-old female with systolic heart failure, atrial
fibrillation previously on coumadin, diabetes mellitus type II,
primary biliary cirrhosis-autoimmune hepatitis overlap syndrome
previously followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] transferred from OSH with
acute on chronic renal failure, liver failure, anasarca,
pancytopenia, and hypothermia.

Per review of OSH summary, she was initially admitted to
[**Hospital 8**] Hospital on [**2170-6-6**] with increased lower extremity
edema, increased abdominal girth, and dyspnea on exertion. This
was associated with decreased urine output, weakness, and
nausea.

Hospital course at [**Hospital 8**] Hospital was as follows:
- Acute on chronic renal failure - Creatinine 3.5 on admission,
up from 2.7 on [**2170-6-1**]. Suspected secondary to ATN vs. prerenal
azotemia. Urine protein to creatinine ratio 4.5 on [**2170-6-11**].
Renal ultrasound WNL. Initially anuric. With administration of
IVF, albumin, and furosemide with increased output, and urine
output increased during remainder of hospital course - until [**1-20**]
days preceding transfer. Creatinine continued to rise. Evaluated
by renal service; HD line not placed secondary to
thrombocytopenia, and recommended CVVH to minimize fluid shifts.
Renal biopsy considered but refused by family.
- Hyperkalemia - Serum potassium 6.0 on morning of transfer.
Given Kayexelate PR prior to transfer.
- Fluid overload - TTE [**2170-6-12**] with EF 60% and no diastolic
dysfunction.
- Aortic valve vegetation - Noted on TTE on [**2170-6-12**]. Negative
blood cultures. SLE suspected, studies sent.
- Hematemesis - Approximately 500cc on [**2170-6-12**]. Hematocrit
dropped from 29-31 to 25. EGD [**2170-6-13**] with grade I varices,
nonbleeding and erosive gastropathy. Protonix gtt started;
octreotide not started. She received 2+ unit pRBC transfusions.

- Hypotension - Midodrine started. sBP stable 90-100.
- Hypothermia - Temperature decreased to 85.3 rectal on [**2170-6-16**].
Blood cultures, peritoneal cultures negative to date. Leukopenic
with 22% bandemia. Ertapenem started for suspected
intraabdominal process. TSH 10, high T3, and borderline low T4.
Cortisol studies WNL.
- Cirrhosis - Longstanding, and suspected secondary to AIH/PBC.
Complicated by esophageal varices. Albumin 2.8, INR 1.9. s/p
paracentesis 2.6 liters with improvement in dyspnea. SAAG 1.4.
RUQ ultrasound with patent vasculature. HIV negative but CD4
248. Hepatitis serologies negative.
- Thrombocytopenia - Nadir 25, required platelet transfusions.
s/p bone marrow biopsy on [**2170-6-15**]. HIT antibody negative
[**2170-6-15**]. Concern for ITP; solumedrol 20mg IV TID started
[**2170-6-14**]. Bone marrow biopsy performed [**2170-6-15**], results pending.
Elevated d-dimer, FDP; no schistocytes on peripheral smear.
- Hematuria
- Right pleural effusion
- Altered mental status - Associated with somnolence, confusion,
and asterixis. Suspected secondary to hepatic encephalopathy.
- Suspected malignancy - Followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] at OSH. Reportedly
with concern for "multiple myeloma, POEMS syndrome,
Waldenastroms, amyloidosis, monoclonal gammopathy." Inconclusive
cytology of ascites, inconclusive but abnormal SPEP, normal bone
scan, CEA 6.6 ([**5-28**]), AFP WNL ([**2164**]), CA19-9 WNL ([**4-28**]).

Of note, she was admitted to same OSH in [**4-28**] with acute on
chronic renal failure and decompensated heart failure. This was
also associated with large volume ascites, anasarca. Her Lasix
dose was decreased and anti-hypertensive regimen changed.
Mulitple myeloma was suspected for an unknown reason and
heme/onc evaluation was reportedly inconclusive.

On arrival to [**Hospital1 18**] MICU, patient is non-verbal. She presents
with family friends, who report she was conversant yesterday,
but not today.

CXR: [**2170-6-16**]
Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates cardiomegaly.
There is mild
congestive failure. There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
There is
mild bilateral bibasilar atelectasis. A single-lead pacer is
present.

CT head: [**2170-6-16**]
No evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.

CT chest/ abdoman/ pelvis: [**2170-6-16**]
CT CHEST: The patient is intubated with the tip of the
endotracheal tube
approximately 1.7 cm from the carina. There are moderate
bilateral pleural
effusions, greater on the right. There is bibasilar dependent
atelectasis.  In the right upper lobe (2:19, 2:21) are
multifocal tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities likely reflecting foci of
infection. The airways are patent to the segmental levels
bilaterally with air bronchograms, particularly in the left
lower lobe. The heart is enlarged with pacer wires. There are
coronary artery vascular calcifications. The central catheter
tip terminates at the cavoatrial junction. No pericardial fluid
is noted. There is no apparent axillary,
hilar, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, but this evaluation is
limited.

CT ABDOMEN: There is a large volume of
