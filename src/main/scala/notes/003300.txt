Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 800**]
Chief Complaint:
diabetic foot ulcer, hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
I+D of R diabetic foot ulcer

History of Present Illness:
61yo M with h/o DM, dementia, MR admitted to podiatry with
diabetic right foot ulcer s/p I+D in OR on [**2128-7-21**] transferred
from PACU to MICU for hypotension. Per records and ED attending
patient was found down at [**Hospital3 **] this morning in feces
and urine. He was brought to the ED where he had a temp to 101,
sinus tach to 150s, WBC 18, and cellulitis on right foot with
purulent ulcer and streaking up leg to groin with track. Mental
status was "alittle out of it" but at baseline per family. Got
4L NS in the ED and APAP and HR down to 120s. XR foot didnt show
evidence of osteo but had track with pus through ulcer. Broad
spec abx were given (vanc/ctz/cipro/flagyl) and he was evaluated
by podiatry and vascular surgery who recommended sending him to
the OR for I+D.
.
In the OR the patient underwent I+D, received fent (75mg)/midaz
(3mg), esmolol and metoprolol for sinus tach in the 150s and neo
for hypotension (100s/50s) and 5L drained 10cc pus from right
foot, EBL 50mL, packed with saline wet-dry dressing change. Per
anesthesia he's had tachycardia treated with esmolol and
hypotensive (100s/50s). superficial culture taken in ED and deep
cultures taken in OR as well. Will likely need debridement and
head of Metatarsal removed over the next few days by podiatry.
.
On the floor, patient is sleeping but arousable. Denies pain.
Denies chest pain and denies palpitations.

[**2128-7-21**] ECG: Narrow complex tachycardia which may be due to
sinus tachycardia or an atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia
with 2:1 conduction. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2124-5-20**]
the rate has increased substantially and there may be an atrial
arrhythmia present.

[**2128-7-21**] CT Head W/Out Contrast: 1. No acute intracranial
pathology. 2. Parenchymal atrophy and small vessel microvascular
disease.
.
[**2128-7-21**] R Foot AP,LAT & OBL X-Ray: : Soft tissue ulceration and
swelling at the medial forefoot at the level of the great toe
with soft tissue ulceration. Markedly limited study for
evaluation for osteomyelitis and if clinically warranted, MRI
may be obtained to further assess.
.
[**2128-7-21**] CXR: No evidence of pneumonia. Equivocal evidence of
mild congestion.
.
[**2128-7-22**] TEE: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in
the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of
the right atrium/right atrial appendage. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 40 cm from the
incisors. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion. .

HISTORY: Foot ulcer status post debridement.

FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of earlier in this date,
there has
been extensive debridement about the first MTP joint with bony
resection.
Area of gas in soft tissues could merely be trapped under the
bandage.
Further information can be gathered from the operative report.


Brief Hospital Course:
61yo M with DM2, vascular dementia found down at [**Hospital3 **]
with infected foot ulcer s/p I+D in OR with hypotension likely
from sepsis.
.
# Sepsis/ right foot osteomyletis: - Resolved  following
aggressive IVF. Lactate normalized and he had improved mentation
and urination.  Covered broadly for infected diabetic foot ulcer
with Vanc/Ceftaz/Cipro/Flagyl initially. Cultures showed
multiple organisms. Was followed by vascular and podiatry.On
wound culture: UNABLE TO R/O OTHER PATHOGENS DUE TO OVERGROWTH
OF SWARMING PROTEUS.STAPH AUREUS COAG +=RARE GROWTH. ANAEROBIC
CULTURE (Preliminary):NO ANAEROBES ISOLATED. Blood pressures are
currently stable. Status post podiatric surgery ([**7-24**])-Resection
of first metatarsophalangeal joint. Radical debridement of skin,
muscle and subcutaneous  tissue, right foot. Delayed primary
closure, right foot. Will be discharged on levofloxacin which
will cover the MSSA which grew from his wound culture.
.
# Tachycardia: A flutter, s/p D/C cardioversion after
amiodarone loading, and beta blocking. TEE did not show
thrombus. Now in sinus with improved BP. Pt started on heparin
gtt which was transitioned to lovenox and coumadin. Has remained
in sinus rhythm. Currently being rate controlled with Metoprolol
75mg TID. Lovenox should
