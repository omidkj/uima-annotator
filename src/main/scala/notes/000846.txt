Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Percocet

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
Diarrhea, abdominal pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Flexible sigmoidoscopy by GI on [**2122-8-5**]

History of Present Illness:
72 year old female with history of COPD on home O2, ovarian CA
s/p TAH/BSO in [**2120**], recently discharged from [**Location (un) 620**] for
diarrhea and orthostasis, p/w continued diarrhea, dizziness and
abdominal pain.

Went to PCPs office on [**7-29**] with one month of watery diarrhea
and shortness of breath typical of her COPD flares. She was
admitted to [**Location (un) 620**] where she tested negative for C. Diff, was
hydrated with IV NS, and treated for a COPD flare with azithro
and a prednisone taper. Discharged [**8-1**] with referral to GI.
Called PCPs office day of admission requesting pain medication
for [**9-18**] abdominal pain. She had been taking ibuprofen for pain,
On BRAT diet and had been able to keep fluids and some food
down.

In the ED, initial VS: T 100.6 HR 136 BP 93/54 RR 20 SpO2
93%/RA. Labs significant for negative U/A, WBC 15, 11% bands, Na
128. Lactate 2.2. CXR shows bibasilar atelectasis ?
consolidation at bases. Abdominal pain resolved. Treated
empirically for CAP with azitho/ceftriaxone. Admitted for
hyponatremia, fever, leukocytosis.

Started on flaygl as the diarrhea was initially thought to be
caused by c. diff toxin. CT showed colitis/edema in ascending
and descending colon likely responsible for abdominal pain. GI
recommended flex sig and transfer to MICU for the procedure (see
below). During the course of hospital day 1, patient had
increasing oxygen requirement with a trigger at 1620 hours for
88% O2 sat on 4L NC. Resolved with nebs. Overnight patient had a
fever of 100.7, tachycardia to 140s and BP of 90/50s while on
albuterol nebs. VS reassuring nebs d/c'ed and vitals repeated.
Tachycardia and leukocytosis was concerning for sepsis and
antibiotics was broadened to Zosyn, Vancomycin, and
Azithromycin. COPD managed with predisone, nebs, and
fluticasone-salmeterol diskus.

IMPRESSION:
1.  Minimal improvement in pancolonic bowel wall thickening
consistent with
colitis.
2.  Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.
3.  Moderate celiac artery and SMA ostial stenosis.  The
mesenteric vessels
are patent. No thrombus identified.
4.  Left lower lobe collapse/consolidation with possible mucus
plug within the
left lower lobe bronchus.

from the left
gastric artery.

[**2122-8-5**] Flex Sig
Impression: 	Granularity, erythema and congestion in the splenic
flexure compatible with ischemic colitis (biopsy)
(biopsy)
Procedure done in ICU. Retained stool was washed away and bowel
wall was well seen. When the area of colitis was seen in the
splenic flexure we did not advace further so as to lesson chance
of complications so extent could not be assessed
Otherwise normal sigmoidoscopy to splenic flexure

[**2122-8-6**] TTE
The left atrium is elongated. No intracardiac right-to-left
shunting seen on 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with
maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
global systolic function are normal (LVEF 60%). The right
ventricular free wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with normal free wall contractility. There is
abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
