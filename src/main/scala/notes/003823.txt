Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 338**]
Chief Complaint:
Uncontrolled pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 28-year-old gentleman with a past medical history
significant for Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] Syndrome (genetic disorder with
excessive bone resorption leading to osteoporosis), restrictive
lung disease from kyphoscoliosis, COPD/asthma, chronic
ventilatory insufficiency with hypercarbia and trach for
nocturnal ventilation and home supplemental O2, multiple
admissions for pseudomonal pneumonia now admitted for pain
control and failure to thrive at home with extensive services.
He is already on Morphine SR 200mg PO BID, MS IR 30-60mg q4
hours PRN, methadone 50mg TID, and baclofen TID for pain related
to a right femur fracture he [**Location (un) 18095**] following a fall in [**Month (only) 958**]
[**2130**] and has been followed by the pain service during his past
hospitalization.  He feels as though he is decompensating at
home secondary to the pain and is unable to transfer himself as
he usually can.  There is no clear precipitant to his increased
pain as he does not report any new falls.
.
In the ED, initial vs were: T=98, HR=96, BP=92/56, RR=18,
POx=98% RA. Plain films were performed of his left forearm and
elbow showing baseline severe osteopenia from with no definite
acute fracture noted, although there is gross deformity and
pseudoarthrosis of the radius with the humerus with marked soft
tissue swelling.  Plain films of his knees bilaterally showed a
known old oblique fracture through the right distal femoral
condyle and the left knee showed severe obliteration of the
joint space with degenerative change, but no discrete fracture
or effusion identified.  A CXR was markedly limited due to
baseline chest wall deformity and scoliosis, but the overall
appearance was relatively stable with slight improved
aeration and no definite single focal consolidation identified.
The patient was given 195mg of morphine SR and 75mg of morphine
IR in the ED and was admitted to the ICU for further pain
control, chronic overnight vent dependency, and will likely
require placement to rehab directly from the ICU given his
inability to function optimally at home despite high level of
home services.  His vitals were stable and he was satting 98% on
RA prior to transfer.
.
On the floor, the patient is complaining of pain that is most
intense throughout his right leg and around his left knee.  He
has also noted thicker, opaque white secretions from his trach
consistent with past infections as well as low grade fevers over
the last 2 days.  He is reluctant to go to rehab as he did not
have a good experience at a rehab his last month long stay
following his last admission.
.

[**Name (NI) 404**]. Has been smoking [**5-16**] cigarettes per day. Rare EtOH use.
Denies illicit drug use.

IMAGING
-------
CXR on admission:
Markedly limited study due to baseline chest wall deformity and
scoliosis.  However, the overall appearance is relatively stable
with slight improved aeration and no definite single focal
consolidation identified.

Left elbow/forearm X-ray [**6-27**]:
Baseline severe osteopenia from Hajdu-[**Location (un) 2987**] syndrome. No
definite acute fracture noted, although there is gross deformity
and
pseudoarthrosis of the radius with the humerus, both of which
are unclear in chronicity given the lack of comparison study.

Bilateral knee X-ray [**6-27**]:
Very limited exam due to multiple factors. On the right, in
particular, there is an overlying brace, which obscures
visualization of the underlying osseous structures. Grossly,
there is an apparent fracture
obliquely through a distal femoral condyle, which is similar to
prior exams as best can be compared. On the left, there is
severe obliteration of the joint space with degenerative change,
but no discrete fracture or effusion identified.

Right femur/tibia/fibula X-ray [**6-27**]:
Markedly limited study as above. The known fracture of the
distal right femur is again redemonstrated and the fracture
fragments are grossly stably aligned.

#. Pain control.  Pain service was consulted for
recommendations, considering his disease process and history of
chronic pain.   Gabapentin was uptitrated, started
nortryptiline, methadone was uptitrated to QID, and tizanidine
was started.  Pain regimen now: nortryptiline 25 mg PO QHS,
gabapentin 800 mg PO QID, combined acetaminophen and ibuprofen
for bone pain, methadone 50 mg QID, tizanidine 2 mg TID.
