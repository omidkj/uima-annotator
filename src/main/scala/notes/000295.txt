Final Report
INDICATION: Left occipital mass.

COMPARISON: [**2119-12-29**] MRI brain from [**Hospital3 3583**] and
scanned into our
PACS system for review.
  FINDINGS: The right occipital lobe mass is similar in size to
the [**2119-11-28**] MRI, measuring today 24 x 27 x 26 mm (AP x ML x
SI). The mass has a thick rind of enhancement and a T1
hypointense center.
The adjacent edema has decreased slightly, with slight interval
expansion of the occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**] and atrium of the left lateral
ventricle and better
definition of adjacent sulci. No new lesions are seen. Major
intracranial
vessels are patent.

IMPRESSION: Left occipital lobe mass, necrotic-appearing. This
can represent a metastasis from the patient's lung cancer or a
primary neoplasm. There has been slight interval decrease in the
adjacent vasogenic edema and slight interval decrease in mass
effect. Study for surgical planning.

MR HEAD W & W/O CONTRAST PRELIMINARY RADIOLOGY REPORT  1.
Post-surgical changes in the left occipital surgical resection
cavity, with small areas of linear nodular enhancement within,
which may relate to post-surgical changes/residual tumor or a
combination of both.
2. Areas of decreased diffusion in the periphery of the left
occipital lobe posteriorly and medially, may relate to acute
infarction. Consider followup to assess interval change.
Persistent surrounding vasogenic edema and partial effacement of
the atrium of the left lateral ventricle and the left occipital
[**Doctor Last Name 534**]. Other details as above.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient presented electively for suboccipital craniotomy for
resection of tumor on [**2120-1-11**].  It was an uncomplicated
procedure, and she was admitted to the ICU for Q1 neurochecks
and Dexamethasone. She had no issues overnight and her pain was
well controlled.

On [**2120-1-12**], the morning of POD #1 she felt well and she had no
acute issues.  SHe was transferred out of the ICU to the floor.
She experienced a severe headache and her pain medications were
changed with good post operative pain relief.  On exam the
patient ws stable with right field cut noted. A decadron taper
was written.

On [**1-13**], the patient ws seen by physical therapy.  She was
noted to ambulate independently but had higher level balance
issues requiring home physical therapy. The patient had her post
operative MRI of the brain which was reviwed by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
consistent with expected post operative change.

On [**2120-1-14**], the patient was tolerating a regular diet,
ambulating in the halls independently. The patient had not had a
post operative bowel movement but was passing flatus and has
baseline constipation. On exam, a visual field cut was no
apprieciated and the patients strength and sensation was full.
Pupils were equal and reactive bilaterally.  The surgical
incision was clean dry and intact
