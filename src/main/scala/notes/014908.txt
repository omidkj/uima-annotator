Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1666**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pleurex catheter placement.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 63yo gentleman with h/o thoracic aortic
aneurysm and tobacco abuse admitted with shortness of breath.

Over the last 3 weeks, Mr. [**Known lastname **] has had worsening shortness
of breath, particularly at night.  He wakes up repeatedly during
course of night unable to get his breath.  Uses a fan to try to
relieve his sense of dyspnea and symptoms improve after 15-20
minutes.  He describes DOE such that he has to stop to rest [**3-14**]
times when climbing 2 flights of stairs.  +Chronic cough
productive of white sputum.  +Weight loss of >30 pounds over 3
months.  He sleeps with only one pillow.

Patient also describes chronic tightness around his chest
wrapping around his left side to his back at the bottom of his
rib cage ever since he had a repair of esophageal rupture about
5 years ago at [**Hospital1 112**].  Over the last 3 weeks, this chronic pain
has been more intense.

At [**Hospital3 3583**], he was given nebulizers with some
improvement in symptoms.  CT chest showed stable aneurysm at
4.5cm but new 2.7x2.6cm non-calcified thrombus.  He was also
found to have a large, loculated right pleural effusion with R
hilar and mediastinal adenopathy compressing his right middle
and lower lobe.

In the ED, his VS were:  97.5   143/100   86   16   97% 4L.   He
was started on an esmolol gtt, but continued to have SBP in
150s-160s and pulse in 70s-80s.  He also received morphine 4mg
IV for pain.  CT surgery evaluated the patient and stated there
was no indication for surgery.

On review of symptoms, he denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors.
He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All of the other
review of systems were negative except as noted above.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence ankle edema,
palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Past Medical History:
HTN
Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm
Esophageal rupture [**1-11**] emesis (Boerhaave's syndrome)
Chronic bronchitis
Rheumatoid Arthritis??
Denies h/o CAD but has stress test suggestive of prior ischemia
(described below)

ALLERGIES: NKDA

OUTPATIENT CARDIOLOGIST:  in [**Hospital1 1562**], name unknown
PCP:  [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (?sp) of Born, Mass

Social History:
Social history is significant for the presence of current
tobacco use:  [**12-11**] PPD since the age of 14, continues to smoke.
There is a history of alcohol abuse, though he stopped 10 years
ago.  He also did coke up until 3-4 months ago; he denies ever
using IV drugs.

Family History:
There is a family history of premature coronary artery disease
or sudden death:  his father d. of an MI at the age of 57.  His
mother is alive at the age of 97.  He has a brother who had a
stroke at about 60yo.

accessory muscles to breath.  Able to speak in full sentences.

appropriate. Pleasant.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. +conjunctival
pallor.
Neck: Supple with JVP of 8 cm.
CV: PMI located in 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line.
RR, normal S1, S2. No S4, no S3.
Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis.
Decreased breath sounds at right base > left base.  Poor air
movement with scattered crackles and wheezes audible.
Abd: +BS, soft, NTND, No HSM or tenderness. No abdominial
bruits.
Ext: No c/c/e. No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.
Pulses:
Right: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP

Left: Carotid 2+ without bruit; Femoral 2+ without bruit; 2+ DP

Pertinent Results:
EKGs:  no prior for comparison
11:23  NSR with PACs, normal axis, slow R wave progression,
non-specific T wave changes (flat in inferior leads and I, aVL
and TWI in V6.
17:03  as above except T waves biphasic in V4 and TWI in V5-V6.

.
TELEMETRY demonstrated:  NSR in the 60s.
.
Echo from [**Hospital1 1562**] [**2171-6-3**]:  Mild concentric LVH with reduced
LV diastolic compliance.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2172-6-26**] (PRELIM):
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic root is moderately dilated at the sinus level. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved biventricular systolic function.
Dilated ascending aorta with mild (1+) aortic regurgitation. If
number of aortic cusps needs to be determined, would recommend
full study by son[**Name (NI) 930**].
.
adenosine stress with nuclear imaging [**2171-6-3**]:
Poor exercise tolerance with normal HR and no chest pain.
Nonspecific STT changes, no arrhythmias.  Nuclear imaging
suggestive of prior infarct with mild fixed defects in the
inferior and mid basal regions.  Estimated EF 44%.

CT Chest [**2171-4-12**]:
Thoracic aortic aneurysm, maximal diameter 4.5cm.  No
dissection.  No mediastinal or hilar adenopathy.  Multiple
nodular appearing areas in both lungs (11mm in Left upper lung,
etc).
.
CT Chest w/ contrast [**2172-6-26**]:
Unchanged dilatation as compared with prior (max 4.5cm).  Now
has large noncalcified irregular thrombus in distal aspect of
the proximal portion of the descending aorta (2.7 x 2.6 cm).
Left ventricle is hypertrophied; recommend echo to r/o thrombus.
Complex right pleural effusion with multiple loculations as well
as nodules and septations within the effusion.  +Adenopathy in
right hilum and mediastinum with compression of the middle lobe
and RLL bronchus and significant atelectasis of the middle lobe.
Highly suspicious for malignancy.
---------
CT Abd/Pelvis:
IMPRESSION:
1. There is no definite evidence of metastatic disease beneath
the
hemidiaphragms. However, the left adrenal gland is bulky,
raising concern for neoplastic involvement. There is a sizable
right retrocrural node as well.
2. Abnormal soft tissue along the base of the right chest along
the superior aspect of the right hemidiaphragm, concerning for
neoplasm. There is also a multiloculated right pleural effusion
and abnormal densities within the right middle and right lower
lobes of the lungs, which are not fully characterized on this
study.
3. Two rounded hypodensities within the liver, which are not
fully
characterized. These could represent cysts.
4. Changes related to prior esophageal perforation.
--------
CXR S/P Pleurex Catheter Placement:
IMPRESSION:
1. Interval decrease in volume of right-sided pleural effusion
status post
drainage of 1.5 liters of fluid. No evidence for pneumothorax.
2. Continued right middle and lower lobe atelectasis.
--------
Cytology:
DIAGNOSIS: Pleural fluid:

  POSITIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS,
  consistent with malignant epithelioid neoplasm. (See note.)

  Note: The differential diagnosis includes adenocarcinoma and
  mesothelioma. The corresponding slide from the hematology
  lab (933A) was reviewed and shows similar findings.
  Immunostains of a cell block preparation are pending and
  will be reported in an addendum.
