Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 896**]
Chief Complaint:
Transfer from OSH for increasing apneic spells secondary to
tracheobronchomalacia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
40 yo F with h/o obesity, obstructive v central sleep apnea, and
tracheomalacia requiring tracheostomy.  She was admitted to
[**Hospital 1727**] Medical on [**9-1**] with LE cellulitis and treated with IV
vancomycin and cefepime for 5 days and switched to PO Keflex. On
[**9-3**], her trach was changed out but she became apneic,
unresponsive, and hypoxic, with desaturation to the 30s. She was
given narcan without significant changes. A head CT was normal.
She was bagmask ventilated with improvement of her saturations
to 100%. She was placed on a vent transiently, but subsequently
weaned back to trach collar. On [**9-7**], the patient underwent a
bronchoscopy that showed severe tracheobroncheomalacia with
80-90% collapse. The patient is transfered here for
Interventional Pulmonary evaluation and possible treatment for
her TBM.
.
Of note, at night, her trach is capped, and she wears oronasal
adaptive servo ventilation with O2 bled in.  She has significant
baseline dyspnea with exertion and central apneic spells. She is
reported to be comfortable at rest without dyspnea or hypoxia,
or hemodynamic instability. On the floor, the patient is stable
and comfortable. She notes that her lower extremity cellulitis
has much improved. Her breathing is stable and she is not
hypoxic, nor dyspnic while speaking. She states that her apneic
episodes are initiated by coughing spasms.
.

[**9-20**] EEG
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study
because
of mild diffuse background slowing and slow alpha rhythm. These
findings are indicative of mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction
which is
etiologically non-specific. None of the patient's typical
episodes of
confusion were recorded during the study. No epileptiform
discharges or
electrographic seizures are present.
.
[**9-22**] 24 hour EEG
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal continuous ICU monitoring study
because
of mild diffuse background slowing. These findings are
indicative of
mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which is etiologically
non-specific.
There was one pushbutton event for unclear reasons, and the EEG
around
this time shows no change from baseline. There were no
epileptiform
discharges or electrographic seizures. Compared to the prior
day's
recording, there is no significant change.
.
[**9-22**] Renal US
FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 14.4 cm and the left kidney
measures 13.7 cm. There is no hydronephrosis. No cyst or stone
or solid mass is seen in either kidney. No perinephric fluid
collection is identified. The bladder is collapsed on a Foley
catheter.
IMPRESSION: No hydronephrosis. Unremarkable renal ultrasound.
.
[**9-23**] MRI brain
FINDINGS:
There are scattered areas of periventricular and subcortical
white matter
signal abnormality identified, which are nonspecific, though
likely related to the patient's known history of multiple
sclerosis. There is no associated T1 signal abnormality.
Otherwise, the brain parenchyma is normal in signal intensity.
There is no
signal abnormality identified within the brainstem. There is no
evidence of hemorrhage. There is no parenchymal edema, mass
lesion, or mass effect.  There is no focus of abnormal
susceptibility to suggest the presence of blood products, and
there is no area of slow diffusion to suggest acute or subacute
infarct.
Ventricles and sulci are normal in size a
