changed to black "coffee ground."  He has been unable to eat
during this time, although has not been eating well for a
long while due to early satiety.  This episode is only the
most recent in a long history of intermittent instruction,
causing multiple hospitalizations and two surgeries.
However, his episodes of hematemesis has been increasing in
the frequency over the past three months, four times in [**Month (only) 116**],
twice in [**Month (only) **] and twice in [**Month (only) 205**].  These recent episodes were
usually preceded by a couple of days of fever of 100 to 102
degrees for which he would take an antipyretic (unsure of
what exactly) after vomiting he would feel relief.  He was
hospitalized several times for this problem over the past
several years while living in [**Location (un) 86**], but has stopped
presenting to the hospital with these episodes, because of
his frustration over the lack of a clear explanation for his

whitish-yellowish sputum and abdominal bloating and nausea.

He was seen by his primary care physician at [**Hospital3 **]
([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1446**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) and was referred to the [**Hospital1 190**] for an abnormality noted on chest x-ray.

While in the Emergency Department he had an nasogastric tube
placed, which drained black fluid, which was guaiac positive.
He received 2 liters of normal saline and Protonix.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Traditional Chinese medications
and "stomach pills."

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Denies tobacco or alcohol use.  Lives with
family.  Speaks only Mandarin Chinese.  Retired engineer
originally from [**Country 651**], moved to [**Location 8398**]in [**2091**], moved
to [**Location (un) 86**] in [**2108**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination the patient
was afebrile, temperature 98.4.  Pulse 62.  Blood pressure
128/58.  Respirations 18.  In general he is cachectic elderly
Chinese male resting comfortably in bed in no acute distress.
His skin was anicteric.  His head and neck examination was
remarkable for temporal wasting bilaterally.  Tube in place
draining black liquid.  His chest examination was remarkable
for a 2 out of 6 holosystolic murmur best appreciate at the
left lower sternal border.  He had slight crackles in his
right lung base, otherwise his chest was clear to
auscultation.  His abdomen had well healed surgical scar.
Bowel sounds were present.  Abdomen was nondistended,
nondistended.  There were no masses or hepatosplenomegaly.
Shoddy lymphadenopathy in the inguinal region.  Rectal
examination was guaiac negative.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  On admission white blood cell
count was 8.3, hematocrit 34.7, platelets 326.  Chest x-ray
[**2110-8-25**], revealed a 4.4 cm diameter cavitary lesion overlying
right hilum, concerning for reactivation tuberculosis.  Right
upper lobe fibronodular opacity, bronchiectasis and pleural
thickening.  Also seen were coarse reticular opacities at the
bases.  KUB [**2110-8-25**] - nonspecific, nonobstructed bowel gas
pattern possibly representative of ileus.  [**8-27**] chest CT
previously noted cavitary lesion most likely represents a
cystic dilatation of the right upper lobe and main stem
bronchus.  Also seen was focal consolidation of the inferior
right lung base and mucous plugging.  [**8-31**], chest x-ray
new focal infiltrate at right lung base medially, compatible
with pneumonia.  Also possible second infiltrate at left
base.  [**2110-9-2**] enteroclysis - multiple nodular filling defects
as well as focal area of nodular thickening and tethering in
left lateral abdomen.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Rule out tuberculosis:  Original chest
x-ray showed lesions suspicious for pulmonary tuberculosis.
The patient was placed on respiratory precautions and three
induced sputum samples were sent for acid fast bacilli were
sent.  Subsequent chest CT revealed that the suspicious
lesion seen on plain film actually represented
bronchiectasis. Sputum analysis returned negative for acid
fast bacilli.  At this time respiratory precautions were
discontinued.

2.  Recurrent small bowel obstruction/hematemesis:  The
patient had a long history of recurrent small bowel
obstruction of unclear etiology.  Episodes of hematemesis now
appear to be worsening.  Flatus, which provided some relief
of symptoms.  The patient was placed NPO and received
intravenous fluids at maintenance.  The patient also received
Protonix for history of gastritis.  The patient was gradual
able to tolerate foods by mouth after removal of nasogastric
tube without difficulty.  On hospital day five the patient
had esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed, which showed short
segment of Barrett's esophagus, gastritis in the stomach body
evidence of a jejunojejunostomy.  A median hiatal hernia was
present.  However, there was no evidence of old or active
bleeding.  However, on hospital day seven the patient began
to experience hematemesis.  The patient was transferred to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit for a repeat
esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  Upon arrival to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit the patient was noted to be febrile with
a temperature of 104, heart rate of 130 and blood pressure of
90/50.  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was deferred for
stabilization.  On hospital day nine the patient was deemed
stable and asked to return to the general medical floor.  The
patient had enteroclysis performed on that day.  This showed
nodular mural filling defects with serosal spiculations.
Also seen were areas of wall thickening and tethering in mid
jejunum.  These findings were concerning for malignancy
versus granulomatous disease.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] of surgery for
follow up as an outpatient, in order to explore the
possibility of an exploratory laparotomy in the future or
bowel lesions.

3.  Pneumonia:  The patient was noted to be febrile with a
temperature of 104 upon transfer to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit.  Chest x-ray at that time revealed a new focal
infiltrate in the right lung base.

4.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition:  The patient's diet
was advanced cautiously.  Electrolytes were monitored and
repleted as necessary in the setting of a potential refeeding
syndrome.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.
