Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 290**]
Chief Complaint:
transfer for eval of possible TBM

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
mechanical ventilation
Pigtail catheter placed in left pleural space

History of Present Illness:
76M h/o Afib, dCHF, obesity, COPD on home O2, DM2, recurrent
left pleural effusion with reported TBM at OSH, failure to wean
from vent transferred from IP service for multifactorial
respiratory failure.
.
Initially presented to [**Hospital6 **] with increased cough
and dyspnea on [**2173-2-1**]. Reported sleeping upright for 2-3 days
in a recliner. Also occasional subjective chills and minimally
productive cough. Increase in chronic LE edema. Reported that he
previously received all medical care in [**State 108**], and not
established care in MA yet, but had long ICU stay in [**Month (only) **] or [**Month (only) **]
[**2172**] for respiratory failure requiring chest tube for pleural
effusion, possible heart failure, treated with steroids and
antibiotics.
.
At OSH, he was admitted to ICU. CXR with complete opacification
of left hemithorax and left chest tube placed with drainage of
600cc serous fluid. Started on BiPAP. Wife had reversed DNR/DNI
decision and therefore intubated. Labs with WBC 6.4, HCO3 36,
Cre 1.1, negative cardiac enzymes, and pro-BNP 1173. CTA chest
negative for PE on [**2173-2-2**] but revealed bilateral pleural
effusions with complete left lung field volume loss. Developed
rapid Afib intermittently that responded to Diltiazem, started
on IV heparin gtt. Ruled-out for MI. Echo was poor study due to
obesity and could not be interpreted. Antibiotics were
discontinued when cultures returned negative. Flexible
bronchoscopy revealed left mainstem collapse, mucous plugging.
Unable to wean off vent. Accepted by IP service for evaluation
and management of TBM.
.
Bronch here without significant TBM, but moderate bilateral BM.
L pigtail chest tube placement on [**2173-2-11**] drained 2.4L since that
time. Extubated on [**2173-2-12**] to BiPAP 24/10 with occasional desats
to 86%. CHF thought to be major component and diuresing with IV
lasix. Intermittently poorly rate controlled. With his wife, the
patient requested to be made DNR/DNI. IP suggesting
consideration of trach for obesity-hypoventilation, although
this has not yet been discussed in detail. Transfer from IP
service to MICU for further care.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**2173-2-11**]: FINDINGS: Technically limited study shows a left
subclavian PICC line extending into the inferior vena cava.
There is opacification of much of the left hemithorax without
displacement of the midline structures. This suggests large
pleural effusion with some underlying atelectasis. Prominence of
pulmonary vessels could reflect elevated pulmonary venous
pressure or shunting of blood flow to the right lung.
  The tip of the endotracheal tube is somewhat difficult to see,
though appears to be about 5 cm above the carina.
.
CXR [**2173-2-12**]:  Since yesterday, a left pigtail was installed, with
significant improvement in left pleural effusion and left lung
aeration. This study is technically very limited. No
pneumothorax is seen given those technical limitations. ETT and
nasogastric tube are still in unchanged position. Right basilar
opacities persist, likely atelectasis
.
CXR [**2173-2-13**]:  1. Stable leftward shift of the mediastinum. This
appears slightly more pronounced than on the initial film from
[**2173-2-11**] at 21:53 p.m., but unchanged compared with [**2173-2-12**] at
14:37 p.m.
  2. Continued opacity throughout the left lung, particularly at
left base -- pt is difficult to distinguish how much of this is
due to consolidation, pleural fluid, or possible elevated left
hemidiaphragm. However, compared with [**2173-2-11**], there is some
increase in degree of aerated lung. No pneumothorax is detected.

.
CXR [**2173-2-14**]:  1. Worsening opacification of the left lung and, I
suspect, increased leftward shift of the mediastinum, suggesting
an element of atelectasis. There is also probably associated
pleural fluid and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
  2. Pulmonary vascular plethora on the right, likely reflecting
CHF.
  3. More confluent alveolar opacity at the right base - - ?
alveolar edema. The differential diagnosis includes a pneumonic
infiltrate. In the
appropriate clinical setting, this could also reflect the
presence of ARDS.
.
CXR [**2173-2-15**]:  FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**2-14**],
there is persistent opacification of virtually the entire
hemithorax on the left. Some displacement of the trachea to that
side is again seen. The evidence of increased pulmonary venous
pressure persists and the pigtail catheter is again seen at the
left base.
  IMPRESSION: Little overall change
.
Echo [**2173-2-15**]:  The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal
wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The estimated
cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve
stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Normal biventricular
cavity sizes with preserved biventricular systolic function.
Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No definite
valvular pathology identified.
These findings are suggestive of a primary pulmonary process
(e.g., pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, COPD, sleep apnea, etc.).

Brief Hospital Course:
76M h/o Afib, dCHF, COPD, Obesity, DM2, and TBM by report from
OSH with multifactorial respiratory failure.  Discussions with
patient??????s wife indicate that he is DNR/DNI and moving towards
comfort care only.
.
# Respiratory failure:  Multifactorial in etiology.  No evidence
of tracheobronchial malacia on bronchoscopy today.  Secondary to
COPD, obesity-hypoventilation, diastolic CHF, and pleural
effusion from volume overload.  The patient was intubated on
transfer, and was successfully e
