Brief Hospital Course:
1.  symptomatic bradycardia - Pt was likely bradycardic due to
digoxin toxicity.  Digibind was given to the patient at the
outside hospital, and there was no indication for acute
dialysis.  The precipitating factors of digoxin toxicity were
thought to be diarrhea and dehydration-induced renal failure,
causing decreased clearance of dignoxin.  Digoxin was stopped,
as was his beta blocker.  Pt's heart rate increased to 70s-80s
and he was hemodynamically stable.  His digoxin was
discontinued.  He was tried again on his beta blocker prior to
discharge, but this again resulted in bradycardia into the low
50s.

2.  acute on chronic renal failure - Pt's chronic renal failure
was thought to be due to long-standing hypertensive disease; pt
was also taking continual NSAIDs.  Renal consult was called.
Acute renal failure was thought likely to be due to ATN due to
the course of recovery and post-ATN diuresis; ATN developed most
likely in the setting of long-standing dehydration, with NSAID
use.  FENa was 1.5%.  A smear for urine eosinophils was
negative.  Pt's renal ultrasound showed somewhat enlarged
kidneys, raising the concern for multiple myeloma; SPEP and UPEP
were sent.  Of note, pt had nephrotic range proteinuria on 2
different urine samples (5.4g/day and 6.5g/day); the etiology
for this is unclear, but could be due to minimal change disease.
 Pt will follow up in nephrology clinic.  During the course of
his hospitalization, pt's renal function was in the direction of
recovery (Cr on admission 3.7, on discharge 2.8, baseline about
1.3).  Pt had good urine output during his stay and did not
require dialysis.

3.  hyperkalemia - Hyperkalemia was thought to be due primarily
to acute renal failure, but also with ACE inhibitor and
triamterene use.  These drugs were held. Pt's potassium was 7.6
on admission.  He was treated with lasix, Kayexalate, D50, and
insulin.  Pt's potassium was better controlled by HD #2 and
remained stable throughout the rest of his hospitalization.
This was likely due to renal failure and reolved with
improvement of renal function.

4.  diarrhea - Pt's diarrhea had resolved by HD #2.  Stool
studies were sent, which were negative for C diff, Salmonella,
and Shigella.

5.  hypertension - Pt's SBP was around 160s-170s on transfer to
the floor.  His baseline per clinic notes seemed to be around
160s.  This may be a contributing factor to his chronic kidney
disease.  Pt's ACE I was held in the setting of acute renal
failure; BB was held in the setting of symptomatic bradycardia;
diuretics were held in the setting of acute renal failure.
Therefore, pt was ultimately begun on amlodipine 10mg the day
prior to discharge, and his SBP over the course of t
