Conclusions
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %). There is
global hypokinesis with inferior wall akinesis. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is
critical aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild to
moderate ([**11-20**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is
seen.

POSTBYPASS
LV systolic function is essentially unchanged from prebypass. RV
systolic function remains preserved. There is a well, seated,
well functioning bileaflet mechanical prosthesis in the aortic
position. Valvular AI is present which is both normal in
quantity and location for this type of prosthesis. The remaining
exam is unchanged from prebypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on [**2158-10-2**] where
the patient underwent CABG x 2 and Aortic Valve Replacement
(23mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] mechanical) with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].   Overall the
patient tolerated the procedure well and post-operatively was
transferred to the CVICU in stable condition for recovery and
invasive monitoring.
POD 1 found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and
breathing comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact
and hemodynamically stable, weaned from inotropic and
vasopressor support.  Beta blocker was initiated and the patient
was gently diuresed toward the preoperative weight.  Coumadin
was initiated for the mechanical valve.  The patient was
transferred to the telemetry floor for further recovery.  Chest
tubes and pacing wires were discontinued without complication.
Beta blocker was changed to Toprol for history of chronic
systolic heart failure.  ACE Inhibitor should be considered when
blood pressure tolerates.  Statin was not started due to
idiopathic hyper-creatinine kinasemia. He remains on Ezetimibe
only. Vancomycin was started for cellulitis of the right knee.
Prior to discharge, Vancomycin was transitioned to PO Bactrim.
He remained afebrile. The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility.  By
the time of discharge on postoperative day four, the patient was
ambulating freely, the wound was healing and pain was controlled
with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged home with VNA
services in good condition with appropriate follow up
instructions. Prior to discharge, arrangements were made and
confirmed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Given his mechanical aortic valve,
Warfarin should be titrated for goal INR between 2.5 to 3.0.
