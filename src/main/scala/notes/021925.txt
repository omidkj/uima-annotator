HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 83-year-old male with
a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary
artery bypass graft, with an ejection fraction of around 10%
due to ischemic cardiomyopathy, who presented to an outside
hospital with chest pain and was transferred to [**Hospital1 346**] for catheterization and carotid
evaluation as he was reported to have bilateral critical
carotid artery stenoses.

He arrived at the outside hospital on [**1-9**] with chest
pain, shortness of breath, and congestive heart failure
exacerbation.  He developed positive cardiac enzymes with a
peak creatine kinase of 962, and a MB of 24.6, with a MB
index of 2.7.  An echocardiogram revealed an ejection
fraction of 10% to 20%.  He was also noted to have bilateral
80% carotid stenoses and evidence of lateral ischemia on a
Persantine stress test.

Echocardiogram at [**Hospital1 69**]
confirmed significant left ventricular dilatation and
dysfunction, but carotid Doppler showed no significant
stenoses with 70% to 79% on the left and 40% to 49% on the
right.  He was deemed to not be a candidate for carotid
endarterectomy, but was taken to cardiac catheterization for
his non-Q-wave myocardial infarction.

Catheterization revealed significant native 3-vessel disease,
and none of his coronary artery bypass graft grafts were
patent.  He underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty and stenting of his proximal left anterior
descending artery lesion and had complications with
hypotension and high filling pressures during the
intervention.  He briefly required Milrinone and was
ultimately stabilized on dopamine and an intra-aortic balloon
pump.

After the case, he was transferred to the Coronary Care Unit
for further management.  Other positive findings on review of
systems included hemoptysis and anemia of unknown etiology.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2168**] at [**Hospital6 **] with unknown
graft anatomy.
2.  Ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of less
than 20%.
3.  Peripheral vascular disease.
4.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by chronic renal
insufficiency.
5.  His AV nodal disease, status post pacemaker placement.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER:
1.  Carvedilol 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Captopril 12.5 mg p.o. t.i.d.
5.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
6.  Heparin drip.
7.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d.

ALLERGIES:  Allergy to ERYTHROMYCIN, IODINE, and PRONESTYL.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his wife.  [**Name (NI) **] has four
children including two very involved daughters.  [**Name (NI) **] smoked
for 30 years but quit in [**2144**].  There is no alcohol use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  His father died at age [**Age over 90 **] of cancer.  His
mother died at age 86 of pneumonia.  He has one brother with
diabetes and nine of his other siblings are healthy.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  This is an elderly man
in no acute distress with a blood pressure of 153/71, a heart
rate of 39, a respiratory rate of 16, and oxygen saturation
of 95% on 1 liter nasal cannula.  He is afebrile and weighs
45 kg.  His head, ears, nose, eyes and throat examination was
unremarkable.  His neck was supple with no jugular venous
distention nor carotid bruits.  His lungs were clear except
for bibasilar rales.  His heart was regular with no murmurs.
His abdomen was benign.  His extremities were warm with no
edema.  His neurologic examination showed that he was awake
and oriented times three with intact cranial nerves.  He was
moving all four extremities spontaneously and had grossly
intact sensation.  His deep tendon reflexes were 1+
bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Laboratories on
presentation included a white blood cell count of 7.7,
hematocrit of 32.4, and platelets of 210.  His Chem-7 was
within normal limits except for a blood urea nitrogen of 19
and a creatinine of 1.3.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram before catheterization
showed a paced rhythm with a left bundle-branch block.  There
were no acute changes suggestive of ischemia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] was kept on aspirin, digoxin,
and captopril.  He was started on Lipitor and Plavix after
receiving his stent.  He was also placed on a heparin drip
for his low ejection fraction, but given his overall
functional status and that he was a poor candidate for
long-term anticoagulation it was stopped.

He was diuresed as he presented in failure and had great
improvement in his hemodynamics, especially his cardiac
output and his index to the point where he was able to be
weaned off of the balloon pump and off of pressors.  His
Swan-Ganz catheter was then removed.

Also of note, he had an increased creatine kinase after
intra-aortic balloon pump placement that peaked at around
5000 with negative MBs.  There was a concern for lower
extremity ischemia from the balloon exacerbating his
peripheral vascular disease.  This increased creatine kinase
was asymptomatic and continued to trend down during his
entire course.

From a pulmonary standpoint, a single chest x-ray on
[**1-19**] showed evidence of a tiny apical pneumothorax.
This was two days after right internal jugular placement for
a Swan.  This pneumothorax was not seen on repeat chest x-ray
on [**1-20**].

From an infectious disease standpoint, he spiked a fever in
the middle of his course and was started on empiric
vancomycin and levofloxacin to cover for line sepsis and
pneumonia.  There was a question of a left lower lobe
infiltrate on chest x-ray.  Blood and urine cultures were
negative.  After his sputum culture grew out Staphylococcus
aureus, his antibiotics were changed to dicloxacillin for a
10-day course.  He remained afebrile after initially starting
antibiotics.

For his anemia, he received multiple transfusions with an
increase in his hematocrit to 34 by the time of discharge.

He was briefly placed on Diamox for a metabolic alkalosis
that developed after his intervention.  This improved, and
the Diamox was stopped.  He was also on a 1.5-liter
restriction for his congestive heart failure.

He had occasional episodes of agitation and sundowning at
night that required Haldol.  From time to time he also
required Ativan for extreme agitation.

With regard to code status, he was full code on presentation
but as it became clear how long a recovery he would have and
the new limitations on his function status that were unlikely
to improve significantly with time, a frank discussion was
held with his very supportive family who decided to change
his code status to do not resuscitate/do not intubate/comfort
measures only and have him go home with hospice.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with hospice.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Coronary artery disease, status post non-Q-wave
myocardial infarction, status post stent placement.
