Attending:[**Doctor First Name 6716**]
Chief Complaint:
menorrhagia, endometriosis, chronic pelvic pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. total laparascopic hysterectomy
2. cystoscopy

History of Present Illness:
28 year old G5P1041 with a history of severe pelvic pain with
laparoscopy-proven endometriosis, metromenorrhagia, and severe
constipation who presents for
preoperative visit.

This patient has failed medical treatments: depo-provera, COCPs,
progestin-only OCPs, Mirena, with moderate-severe side effects
with each.  She  did get some relief from laparoscopy with
excision of endo x4, for 2-6 months each time.  Previous
operative reports from the [**Country 13622**] republic classified her
endometriosis as Stage 2.

The patient has severe pain when menstruating but always has
some
pain at baseline. She has never had normal menses and has
required narcotic medications for pain relief. She has need
excessive amounts of tylenol for pain relief.  SHe is currently
also using Vicodin at bedtime as well as Gabapentin. She also
has
chronic constipation with some discomfort in bowel movements.
She
uses a bowel prep twice a week as well as an enema, fiber
supplements and stool softeners.  There are also plans for bio
feedback.

Radiology:
MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST Study Date of [**2123-3-20**] 2:41 AM
There is no focus of decreased diffusion to suggest an acute
infarct.
On the FLAIR sequence, there is very subtle increased signal
intensity
scattered adjacent to the cortex in the frontal and the parietal
lobes, for example, series 6, image 15. The significance of this
finding is uncertain.  It is unclear if these are artifactual or
related to recent anesthesia or other abnormality. A close
followup evaluation can be considered on a different MRI scanner
to assess stability/progression/resolution.
No focus of negative susceptibility is noted to suggest
hemorrhage.
Ventricles and extra-axial CSF spaces otherwise are
unremarkable. Small cavum septum pellucidum is noted along with
a prominent cavum velum interpositum. The major intracranial
arterial flow voids are noted on the T2-weighted images.
Mild mucosal thickening is noted in the ethmoid air cells. There
is a
retention cyst measuring approximately 2.2 x 1.6 cm in the left
maxillary
sinus/polyp.

MRV HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST:
The major venous sinuses are patent.

IMPRESSION:
1. No focus of acute infarction.
2. Scattered subtle FLAIR hyperintense signal foci adjacent to
the sulci as described above are of equivocal significance.
Unclear if these are
artifactual or related to an abnormality. Interval close
followup evaluation can be considered on a different MRI scanner
from the present one to evaluate for any interval change.
3. Retention cyst/polyp in the left maxillary sinus.

CTA CHEST W&W/O C&RECONS, NON-CORONARY Study Date of [**2123-3-19**]
8:28 AM
FINDINGS: Moderate respiratory motion artifacts that limit the
quality of the CT examination. There are filling heterogeneities
in the intermediate right pulmonary artery, towards the medial
part of the vessel (3, 48) and in a left lower lobe segmental
artery (3, 45). In addition, smaller hypodense attenuation
heterogeneities are seen in both the right and left lower lobes,
at the level of segmental arteries.
Bilaterally, relatively extensive areas of dependent
atelectasis, but on the left, an additional peripheral
wedge-shaped opacity is seen (3, 65). A second right-sided
wedge-shaped opacity is seen at the level of the right lower
lobe apex (3, 43).
The heart is of overall borderline size, but the right heart is
not enlarged, and there is no bulging of the septum. No evidence
of pleural effusions.
Because of the high likelihood of acute pulmonary embolism, the
referring
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 34602**], was paged for notification at the time
of dictation, 9:22 a.m., on [**2123-3-19**].

IMPRESSION: High likelihood of right rather central and left
lower lobe
peripheral pulmonary embolism. There are bilateral wedge-shaped
parenchymal opacities that support this diagnosis.
Moderate bilateral dependent atelectasis. No right heart
enlargement, no
bulging of the intraventricular septum. Free air in the right
upper quadrant after abdominal surgery.

Brief Hospital Course:
28 year old F G5P1041 with h/o severe pelvic pain with
laparoscopy-proven endometriosis, metromenorrhagia, and severe
constipation, h/o DVT s/p short course of anticoagulation and
spontaneous abortion x 5 (details unclear, negative
hypercoagulable workup per report) transferred to ICU for
unresponsiveness, now resolved, and new dx of PE, all on POD 1.
She was transferred back to the floor on POD 2 and discharged on
POD 4.  Her hospital course is organized by systems below.

# unresponsiveness/ sedating medication overdose on POD 1:
likely secondary to multiple sedating medications, including
high doses of opiates received overnight prior to transfer.
Improved with one dose of IV Narcan 0.5mg, although transient.
Patient transferred to unit and with time improved without
further intervention.  We initially held sedating medications
for now, including Ativan.  We attempted pain control with
Toradol and PO Tylenol, but this was inadequate so low dose IV
Dilaudid was started (after a trial of oxycodone without
sedition).  Toradol was discontinued due to questionable
allergic reaction including vasculitic lesion on the right lower
extremity.  After transfer to the floor on POD 2, her pain was
well-controlled with vicodin and she had no further somnolence.

# PE: on POD 1 she complained of chest pain and had persistent
tachycardia to 130s-140s. bilateral PE noted on CTA chest [**3-19**],
likely was contributing to tachycardia and new O2 requirement.
Pt with h/o DVT and multiple spontaneous abortions, it is
possible she has an underlying clotting disorder however testing
in the past has been unremarkable and is unlikely to be helpful
now.  Patient was started on Lovenox 60 mg sc BID, will need
lifelong anticoagulation with Coumadin.  discharged to home with
VNA and lovenox, to make appiontment with [**Hospital 3052**].

# tachycardia: likely [**3-4**] PE and hypovolemia, as tachycardia
improved with IV fluids

# Vasculitic lesion: question temporal relationship to Toradol
administration.  Derm was consulted due to concern of the
lesions, question vasculitis given history of abortions and PE.
Biopsy is pending, no further interventions.

# s/p lap hysterectomy: pt complaining of pain, but tolerated
surgery.  pain controlled with vicodin prior to discharge.

# lower extremity weakness/numbness: likely [**3-4**] epidural
catheter, which persisted a day into the ICU course.  Neurology
was consulted and expressed concern about the possibility of a
venous sinus thrombosis given that the patient also has
left-sided headache. MRI/MRV was
