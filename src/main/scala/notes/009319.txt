History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) **] is a 46 yo man with HIV (CD4 535; VL <50), HCV
cirrhosis s/p recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 2025**] for confusion which
was thought to be secondary to prerenal azotemia secondary to
several large volume taps. At home his confusion continued and
he returned to medical care, this time at [**Hospital1 18**] ER, for this
continued complaint. He has reportedly been having [**5-3**] BMS/day
on lactulose and had been continuing to take his rifaximin for
hepatic encephalopathy as well as norfloxacin for SBP ppx.
In the ED, he was found to be trace guaiac positive and to have
a mildly decreased Hct. His ammonia was 128 but according to his
wife this was down from 220 at [**Hospital1 2025**]. His Cr was 2.7 (up form 1.7)

Echo:
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal.
3. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened.
4. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral
regurgitation is seen.
.
Colonoscopy: normal to cecum
EGD: No varices were noticed.  Granularity, friability,
erythema, congestion and abnormal vascularity in the whole

[**1-15**] U/S: Hepatic arterial flow is now more normal in
appearance compared to the prior study but the portal velocities
have increased across the anastomosis from 60-160 cm/sec.
Clinical consideration should be given to the possibility of
significant portal stenosis and correlation with the clinical
and biopsy findings is recommended.
[**1-17**] CTA: no evidence of stenosis, large amount of ascites, 10
x 4 cm infrahepatic hematoma.
[**1-18**] ERCP: Evidence of extravasation of contrast from the
cystic stump, consistent with biliary leak.  Status post plastic
CBD stent placement.  Filling defects within the biliary system
could be consistent with air, but other causes cannot be
entirely excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
46 yo man with HIV (CD4 535; VL <50), HCV cirrhosis was being
evaluated for liver transplant and diuretic resistent ascites
who presented with confusion.
He was obtunded/encephalopathic, most likely hepatic
encephalopaty + effect of ambien in patient with poor hepatic
fx. He was admitted and had a basic infectious workup including
diagnostic paracentesis, blood, and urine Cx which were all
negative for infection. Ambien/other sedating meds were held and
he was begun on for goal BM [**6-3**]/day + rifaxamib.  His MELD score
on admission was 32 and he was listed for liver transplant.
The patient received a liver transplant on [**2159-1-9**].
Postoperatively he was taken to the SICU, where on POD 1 his
drain output increased and he began to drop his hematocrit. He
was taken to the operating room for washout and control of
bleeding.  Postoperatively he was taken back to the SICU in
stable condition.  On POD [**3-1**], liver u/s showed patent right,
left, and main hepatic arteries, however without diastolic flow,
and a subhepatic hematoma measuring 8 x 4 x 8 cm.  He was
extubated on the morning of POD [**3-30**] and transfered to the
regular floor in the PM in stable condition.
On POD [**8-3**], there was an elevation in his Tbili and alk phos and
a transjugular liver biopsy was obtained, and was indeterminate
for acute cellular rejection.  An ultrasound showed good
arterial flow but a questionable portal stenosis.  A CTA was
obtained, showing patent hepatic and portal flow, with a large
amount of ascites and a 10 x 4 cm infrahepatic hematoma.  JP
drain Tbili checked the following day was 21.9.  He underwent
ERCP on POD [**10-6**], and a biliary stent was placed after contrast
was noted to drain from the cystic duct stump.  His JP drainage
cleared, and on POD [**12-8**], his drain bilirubin was measured at
0.8.
  His drain output decreased.  On POD 17/16, his drain was taken
off of bulb suction, and on POD 18/17, his drain was removed and
the site sutured with 3-0 nylon suture.  He was discharged to
home on POD19/18 with follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 816**].
