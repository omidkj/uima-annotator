some chills. and the morning of admission he was intermittently
confused at home. His wife called EMS and he was initially
brought to [**Hospital3 4107**] where he was found to be hypoxic with
O2 sat in the 60s. He was put on BiPAP. CXR there reportedly
suggested multilobular pna, and patient received ceftriaxone and
azithromycin. Cr 1.5, trop-I 0.76, and ECG with ST changes. Was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS: afebrile, HR 97, BP 153/93, RR 22,
70%RA when off BiPAP. NRB was placed. Exam revealed scattered
wheezing on expiration with poor aeration throughout. WBC 7.2,
Cr 1.7, lactate 0.9, trop 0.13, CK 495, MB 8. ECG had 0.5-1mm
STE in V2, V3, <0.5mm-STD in V5-6, II, TWI in V3-V6. Cards saw
patient in ED and proposed working diagnosis of demand ischemia
from a pulmonary process. Chest CTA showed bibasilar patchy
opacities, no central PE. He received albuterol and ipratropium
nebs, methylprednisolone, and was started on heparin gtt. Prior
to transfer to the MICU, his HR was 93, BP 152/86, 96% on NRB.

Brief Hospital Course:
49-year-old man with history of morbid obesity, HTN, DM2
presented with respiratory difficulty and hypoxia, found to have
wheezing on exam and elevated troponin.
.
# Respiratory failure: Chest CTA showed no pneumonia or PE. Lung
exam revealed poor aeration bilaterally and diffuse wheezes. No
clinical evidence of heart failure. The impression was a COPD
exacerbation in the setting of a possible pulmonary infection.
He was treated with standing nebulizers and prn nebulizers,
steroids with methylprednisolone then prednisone, empiric
antibiotics with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin then just
levofloxacin upon clinical improvement. He was also started on
oseltamivir; however, when the flu swab and rapid viral panel
from nasapharyngeal aspirate came back negative, the oseltamivir
was discontinued. By the time of transfer to the floor, his
oxygen saturation was in the high 80s to mid 90s on 5-6L of NC,
asymptomatic, feeling much better.  He was discared on home o2,
nebulizors and a prednisone taper.
.
# Elevated troponin on admission: on admission his troponin was
0.15 with normal CKMB fraction. ECG showed some minimal ST
elevations in V2-V3 and ST depressions in V3-6 and II.
Cardiology saw the patient in the ED and proposed demand
ischemia in the setting a pulmonary process. Patient never had
chest pain. He was initially on aspirin, statin, metoprolol, and
heparin gtt, which was discontinued after the cardiac enzymes
trended down. An echocardiogram revealed ild biventricular
cavity enlargement with low normal global systolic function.
.
# Acute kidney injury: Cr. 1.7 on admission with unclear
baseline. Most likely prerenal azotemia in setting of pulmonary
infection. Cr down to 1.1 after IVF. His  quinapril was held.

# HTN: SBP in 130s-140s. Quinapril was held, and metoprolol was
started. After his acute renal injury resolved his quinapril was
re-started.
.
# DM2: Glyburide was held. He was hyperglycemic in the 400s
after the initiation of steroids, requiring insulin gtt for a
few hours before getting back on SC insulin.  Patient was
discharged on metformin, glyburide and insulin glargine while on
prednisone.
