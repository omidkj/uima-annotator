Brief Hospital Course:
A [**Age over 90 **] year-old man with a history of DM and HTN presented after
an episode of syncope.  In the ED he was hypotensive and
complained of abdominal pain.  He underwent an abd CT scan.  The
CT scan was negative for abd pathology (did mention slight
distention of redundant sigmoid colon) but did show RLL and RML
and pneumonia.  He stayed in CCU for 2 days for concern of
sepsis and was transferred to the floor on [**2-24**].

# [**Hospital 7502**] health care associated
Upon transfer to the floor, he was treated w/ levoflox [**Date range (1) 79372**];
ceftriaxone on [**11-26**]; vanco on [**11-27**].  A PICC was placed
on [**2-26**] for IV abx and it was removed the day of discharge.  He
remained afebrile and his respiratory status improved
clinically.
.
# Colonic pseudo-obstruction
Pt initially presented with abdominal pain. Pt's abdomen was
distended and repeat KUBs showed colonic distentions.  A CT scan
was concerning for colitis but it was not clinically correlated
and pt was c. difficile negative x 4.  Multiple bowel regimens
were tried and bowel movements resulted, however, he continued
to have worsening distention.  Rectal tubes were attempted x 2
and may have been slightly helpful.  On [**3-6**], GI performed a
colonic decompression in which they were able to advance scope
to beyond splenic flexure, saw large amount of stool.  The next
day, the pt was given 1L golytely with resulting multiple soft
stools.  He did not have a BM after the golytely but his stomach
remained soft and repeat KUB showed improvement.
.
# Decreasing WBC
Has been worked up for leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in the
past ([**11-21**]).  No intervention was made at that time and his
cell lines increased on their own. [**Month (only) 116**] be [**3-18**] meds but no new
meds.  [**Month (only) 116**] be a myelodysplastic picture. By discharge, his WBC
was increasing again.
.
# Anemia
Progressively decreasing HCT w/ low reticulocyte count.
Transfused 1un pRBC with modest increase in HCT.
.
# Stage II coccyx ulcer
Aggressively cared for by nursing.
.
# Syncope
Most likely caused by hypotension secondary to sepsis and
increased vagal tone after bowel movement.
