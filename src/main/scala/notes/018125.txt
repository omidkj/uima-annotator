Allergies:
Iodine; Iodine Containing / Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 3984**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypoxia

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
89 yo F, h/o recent admission for PNA/sepsis/UTI, h/o
COPD/asthma,CHF,AF,DM presents from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab with report of
hypoxia to the 70's and a R lung 'white out' on CXR. In
ambulance bay on arrival had wide complex tachycardia. Pt noted
to be having recent diarrhea and ? c.diff, is on Abx. Pt is
[**Name (NI) 595**] speaking with baseline alzheimer's dementia. Per the
daughter the patient has had chronic abdominal pain since her
PEG procedure from the last admission. At baseline she is
communicative, but since the last admission, the daughter
describes increased confusion and difficulty communicating.
.
Of note, the patient was recently hospitalized from [**3-15**] to [**4-5**]
with sepsis, PNA (MRSA and klebsiella), UTI, course c/b afib
with RVR. Trach, PEG, PICC were performed during that admission.

.
ED Course: Pt was found to be in SVT vs. VT and loaded with amio
and put on an amio gtt. She was then in AF. Cardiology was
consulted. A CXR was done that shows worsened pulmonary edema
since her last admission, though a focal consolidation could not
be ruled out, so she was covered with levo/vanco for ?PNA. She
was also given xopenex and atrovent nebs for wheezing. Labs were
significant for tnt of 0.04 (all <0.01 in past), Cr of 1.3
(baseline 1.0), WBC 10.9 (baseline range 5-10), lactate 1.4, and
a pos UA. other labs as below. vitals on transfer 99, 100 AF,

CXR:
4/27IMPRESSION: Limited study, with:
1. Pulmonary edema, worse since [**2190-4-1**].
2. Tracheostomy and gastrostomy tubes, dual-chamber pacemaker
and right subclavian PICC, as before.
.
Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2190-5-23**]  9:02:46 PM
Atrial fibrillation with an average ventricular rate of 101
beats per minute.
Left bundle-branch block. Low QRS voltage in the limb leads.
Non-specific
ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing ventricular
tachycardia is
no longer present.
TRACING #3
.
abd xray [**5-24**] :IMPRESSION: No bowel dilatation to suggest toxic
megacolon. No evidence of obstruction.
.
cxr [**5-25**] FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**5-23**], the
various devices remain in place. Diffuse haziness of both
hemithoraces with preservation of pulmonary markings is
consistent with substantial pleural effusions. Ill-defined
vessels are consistent with the clinical impression of pulmonary
edema. The possibility of a focal pneumonia is impossible to
exclude, especially in the absence of a lateral view.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 89 yo [**Date Range 595**] speaking woman with multiple medical problems
including COPD/CHF/AF and recent admit PNA/sepsis and is s/p
trach/peg at last admission. Also, in wide complex tachycardia
on arrival, she was loaded with amio and then amio gtt,reverted
to afib afterwards.
.
# Hypoxia: Pt has a h/o COPD and asthma and was noted to be
wheezing on exam. XR was revealing for pulm edema, which seemed
to be corroborated on physical exam, but also may have shown a
consolidation c/w pna. On the vent, patient is now sating well
and had good O2 sats while in the ED. WBC not elevated with no L
shift and afebrile on this. DDx: PNA, CHF, COPD, PE. Likely
hypoxia is secondary to heart failure.
 Abx for HAP, including coverage MRSA/Klebsiella pna :Levo/Vanc.
Pt received doses in ED.  Pt was not specifically treated for
PnA during the hospital stay as she was no displaying signs of
pna. Hypoxia thought secondary to vol overload. Sats improved
after diuresis.  Pt was placed on standing nebs prn. Pt was not
given any steroids as they were not deemed necessary. PT was
given lasix with prn IV boluses for diuresis. Pt will be going
to rehab where her vent settings can be further titrated/weaned
prn.
.
#ID-Pt has h.o C.diff from [**Hospital 100**] Rehab, continued on her PO
vanco. UTI was being treated with Vanco (h/o MRSA UTI in the
past) and cipro.  Holding off for treating for a PNA at this
point. Pt reportedly had one positive blood culture at [**Hospital 100**]
Rehab for enterococcus, which may be a contaminant but would
likely be covered by the vancomycin she is receiving for her
UTI.  Also, the line tip cultured at the time and was negative.
PT is on vanco for ?+bcx and h/o MRSA UTI.
.
# COPD/Asthma: She was continued on her home dose inhalers.
.
# Elevated CE: all previous CE were <0.01 and her admission
Troponin was 0.3, which is mildly elevated. Pt seemed to be
having more abd pain, but being a woman/diabetic atypical
presentations common, so she had three sets of cardiac
biomarkers to rule out MI. Pt ruled out for MI. EKG showed signs
of atrial fib. Pt was continued on her ASA, BB, statin.
.
# CHF: intact systolic EF, h/o diastolic dysfunction but not
assessed due to poor study on most previous echo. Has evidence
of worsening failure on CXR.
diuresis with goal net neg 1L on the day of admission, O2 sats
improved after receiving extra IV lasix (40mg) and diuresing.
.
# Tachycardia: Pt was in a wide complex tachycardia on arrival
to the ED which was felt to be SVT vs. VT. Pt was stable,
maintaning BP and mentating. HR while [**Doctor First Name **] the MICU was irreg in
AF after initiation of amiodarone. Insighting events may include
hypoxia, infection, pain
Cardiology was consulted and recommended d/c amio gtt, starting
diltiazem 30mg po daily and uptitrating PRN. Would suggest dilt
gtt instead of amio as needed for rate control.  She did not
require diltiazem g
