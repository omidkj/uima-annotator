Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 492**]
Chief Complaint:
hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
s/p arteriogram, pulmonary arteriogram

1. Rigid bronchoscopy using a black Dumon bronchoscope.
2. Flexible bronchoscopy.
3. Therapeutic aspiration of secretion.


History of Present Illness:
68M ex-smoker diagnosed with
non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed in [**2165-9-21**] and
underwent chemotherapy x5 and radiation treatment x16 so far.
The patient suddenly had several episodes of coughing up bright
red blood which totaled about [**11-22**] cups two days ago.  He
presented to the [**Hospital 8641**] hospital ED with a hematocrit of 31.7.
Hematocrit was serially followed and was found to be stable and
was saturating well on room air.  His hemoptysis subsided to
some
extent prior to transfer. A chest CT showed no evidence of
pulmonary embolism, however showed left hilar region mass with
encroachment on left proximal pulmonary artery as well as
proximal upper lobe bronchi.  Pulmonology was consulted and he
felt that the hemoptysis was most likely secondary to his lung
cancer or possibly related to radiation induced bleeding.  He
was
concerned about erosion into the pulmonary artery with potential
for serious bleeding and was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care.  On admission, patient is breathing comfortably, with
stable vitals.  Patient reports small amount of dark blood
tinged
sputum.  Denies fever, chills, chest pain and SOB.

[**2165-12-20**] MRSA SCREEN      Source: Nasal swab. FINAL REPORT
[**2165-12-22**]**
   MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2165-12-22**]):    No MRSA isolated.

[**2165-12-20**]: Pulmonary arteriogram was performed showing
unremarkable pulmonary arteries and pulmonary veins. The left
pulmonary apex appears to be hypovascular.  Unable to
selectively catheterize the left upper bronchial artery.
CXR:
[**2165-12-20**]:  Mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. Normal size
of the cardiac silhouette. No evidence of focal parenchymal
opacity suggestive of pneumonia. No pneumothorax, no pleural
effusions.
[**2165-12-19**]: 1. Mildly hyperinflated lungs without radiographic
evidence of pneumonia. Increased opacity in the superior pole of
the left hilum.


Brief Hospital Course:
69 y/o male with COPD, Depression, Anxiety, recently diagnosed
with NSCLC IIIa, s/p Chemo and X-RT, admitted for non-massive
hemoptysis on [**2165-12-19**]. CTA negative for PE with LUL mass
encasing pulmonary artery. No evidence of endobronchial
obstruction.  Interventional pulmonology performed a rigid
bronchoscopy and found normal upper airway. Flexible
bronchoscopy was used to assess more distal airway.  They
encountered a blood clot in apical posterior segment of the left
upper lobe.  For details refer to Operative note.  During the
procedure TEE showed saline bubles in left atrium which
suggested clot communicated with pulmonary vein. Therapeutic
aspiration of secretion were performed at this time.  A
bronchial arteriogram was attempted by IR. However, they were
unable to selectively catheterize the left bronchial artery.
Aortogram was also performed with no signs of bleeding from the
left brachial artery on [**2165-12-19**].  The patient was monitored
overnight in SICU. Thoracic surgery was consulted for possible
intervention.  Thoracic surgery felt that due to the location of
the tumor, surgical resection was not curative.  They
recommended finish neoadjuvent therapy and reassess afterwards.
The following day, IR performed a pulmonary arteriogram on
[**2165-12-20**], which showed unremarkable pulmonary arteries and
pulmonary veins. The left pulmonary apex appeared to be
hypovascular.  However, they were unable to selectively
catheterize the left upper bronchial artery.  The patient
tolerated all procedures and recovered without events.  Patient
did not have any further hemoptysis and vital signs and
hematocrit were stable during this admission.  He was discharged
on [**2165-12-23**] afebrile, vital signs stable, ambulating, tolerating
regular diet and voiding.
