Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a 43 y.o male with h.o germ cell tumor who was sent
to the MICU s/p RPLND for initial post surgical management.  In
the MICU pain control was achieved with PCA and oral morphine.
He was transiently on an beta blockade for control of BP and HR
and titrated off by the afternoon of POD1.  When stable he was
transferred to 12 Riesman, on POD5 a decrease in his O2
saturation was noted and a chest radiographs were suggestive of
bilateral pneumonia, sputum and blood cultures were collected
and found to be negative.  He was again transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for management of developing hypoxia and treatment of pneumonia.
 The etiology of the pneumonia was thought to be from aspiration
and for this reason his NG tube was replaced. In the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] he was
started on Vancomycin and Zosyn, his 02 saturation gradually
improved and he was transferred back to 12 [**Hospital Ward Name 1827**]. On the floor
he continued to recover but on POD9  was noted to have a
significant increase in his Cr level from 0.6 to 1.6.  The cause
was most likely multifactorial and includes insensible loss from
NG tube, low fluid resusitation rates due to a history of
emphysema and bleomycin toxicity and Vancomycin toxicity. Renal
and pulmonary services were consulted, all nephrotoxic
medications were stopped or dosed renally, he was hydrated with
increase in per hour rate and boluses of NS, a Vancomycin trough
was checked and found to be elevated.  His renal function
stabalized after reaching a Cr of 2.6 and slowly trended
downward.  With renal recovery we addressed his slowly declining
hematocrit with 2 units of blood, his HCT responded
appropriately.  The Vancomycin was not restarted the Zocyn was
discontinued after 8 days.  He was transitioned to oral
Ciprofloxacin and Flagyl both renally dosed in preparation for
discharge. He was discharged to home POD15, in stable condition,
tolerating a regular diet, ambulating independently, pain
controlled with a combination of narcotics and neuropathic
medications.  He was instructed to follow up with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] on
[**3-29**] as scheduled along with his Neurologist and Oncologist
as scheduled.
