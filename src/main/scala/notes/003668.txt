ALLERGIES:  Ativan.  He just does not tolerate it well.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, generally he was
tachypneic, ill appearing, in no apparent distress.  He was
febrile with a temperature of 102.4, heart rate 110-130 in
atrial fibrillation.  Blood pressure 110-140/42-81.  Mucus
membranes were dry.  He has a right surgical pupil, left was
2 mm and reactive, no JVD, irregularly irregular heart rate,
no murmurs, diffuse rhonchi, decreased breath sounds in the
left upper lobe, no wheezes.  Abdomen soft, nontender, non
distended, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities, no edema with
ecchymoses.  Neuro, alert and oriented to hospital and name,
not date.  Able to move all extremities.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 30.9.  Chest x-ray, left upper
lobe infiltrate, no CHF.  EKG showed atrial fibrillation.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient first stayed in the unit for a
day and a half, treated for his pneumonia, had a CT scan.
The CT results, without contrast, he had diffuse emphysema,
severe, with bullous changes in the left space, patchy ground
glass in consolidation involving the right lower lobe, the
left upper lobe, the left lower lobe and the lingula.  He had
lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum and no plaque or effusion.
Chest x-ray at this time showed two left infiltrates with
hyperinflated lung fields with bronchiectasis, pneumonia
overlying COPD.  Throughout his stay after day 2 transferred
to a regular floor, continued to improve, his white count
went to 14.9, still with a left shift, was being treated on
Levaquin and Vancomycin.  His heart was being treated with
Diltiazem and Digoxin.  Saturations continued to improve
where he got up to 50% face mask and now is satting well on a
4 liter nasal cannula.  Pulmonary evaluated patient and plan was
continued to treat pneumonia and decided Vancomycin was
unnecessary at that time because there is no evidence for
MRSA.  Outside cultures grew Pseudomonas and patient continued
to be covered by Levaquin and improved.  Before discharge
patient had a swallow study which showed minor aspiration
with thick barium and a little bit more risky aspiration with
thin barium.  Speech and swallow  recommended to keep the patient
on thick nectar liquids and to use the chin tuck position in
swallowing.  The patient will be discharged to rehab and we
expect his pulmonary status to improve from this pneumonia
although he does have severe COPD.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Much improved.  Will be going to rehab.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Pneumonia.
2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  MAT.
6.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
7.  Blindness.
