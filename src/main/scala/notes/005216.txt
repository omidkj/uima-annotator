Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6169**]
Chief Complaint:
Skin lesions and SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 41-year-old man with Hodgkin's Disease s/p
autologous hematopoetic stem cell transplant (HSCT) [**2-11**] and two
prior episodes of varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection
(dermatomal vs. disseminated [**9-12**]; disseminated [**11-11**]) who noted
the onset new lesions along his anterior right torso at 1600
yesterday. The patient's lesions are erythematous, but unlike
classic VZV vesicles, these lesions are maculopapular and not
fluid-filled and not viscular. They are painful and slightly
pruritic, and there is some tingling associated with them as
well. Associated with the eruption of these lesions, he also had
shooting, burning pains along the right side of his torso.
In the ED, he was given acyclovir 900 mg IV x1 for presumed
disseminated VZV infection. He was also given two liters of
normal saline and hydromorphone 4 mg IV for pain control. While
there, the patient's wife noted the evolution of similar,
erythematous, maculopapular lesions along the patient's right
nasolabial fold; he also manifested a few lesions on the left
side of his torso as well. A fluorscein examination was
performed in the ED; there was no uptake or dendritic lesions
bilaterally. Following this eye examination, he was transferred
to 7 [**Hospital Ward Name 1950**].
.
The patient denies antecedent fever or malaise. He denies
ocular, forehead, or scalp pain or hypesthesia. He denies
changes in vision, blurred vision, trouble closing either eye,
or excess or insufficient lacrimation. He denies ear pain,
difficulty hearing, or changes in hearing (tinnitus,
hyperacusis). He denies facial weakness, difficulty speaking, or
change in ability to taste. He denies sense of imbalance or
dysequilibrium. Denies headache, neck stiffness, nausea,
vomiting, or confusion, although he does feel a bit more
sensitive to bright lights than normal. Other than the one dose
of acyclovir he took at home yesterday, he has not taken any
acyclovir in over two months.
.
Of note, 11 days prior to admission, the patient phoned the
oncology clinic and reported a hacking cough productive of
clear/yellow sputum and associated dyspnea. He had a mild sore
throat but had no fevers, coryza, myalgias, or arthralgias at
the time. He was empirically prescribed azithromycin for ten
days; he completed this course of antibiotics yesterday. His
cough and dyspnea have resolved completely.


Past Medical History:
1. Stage 1B Hodgkin's Disease (nodular sclerosis type) diagnosed
in [**2136**] (large anterior mediastinal mass). Treated with six
cycles of ABVD and XRT at that time. In remission until [**8-10**],
when he was treated with CEPP x2. Ultimately received autologous
SCT [**2-11**].
2. VZV infection [**11-11**] and [**9-12**] as per HPI
3. Line-related venous thrombus treated with line removal, lytic
therapy, and thrombectomy followed by six weeks of enoxaparin
[**11-10**]
4. Presumed community-acquired pneumonia [**8-12**]
5. Anxiety
6. Depression
7. Radiation-induced pleuropericarditis
8. Bleomycin-induced lung toxicity
9. Chronic lower extremity pain
10. Myocarditis [**5-8**]

Social History:
The patient lives at home with his wife and two children (an
eleven-year-old son and a nine-year-old daughter). His son was
just diagnosed with the chicken pox yesterday. His daughter has
never had the chicken pox; both children have had the VZV
vaccine. The patient works as a heating contractor (pipe
fitter). He has a 20-pack-year smoking history; he is currently
smoking [**4-11**] cigarettes daily. He drinks [**1-8**] glasses of wine per
week. He denies illicit drug use or abuse. He traveled to
[**State 622**] in [**6-12**]. He has no pets.

Family History:
The patient's niece has leukemia. His mother has hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, and a history of rheumatic heart disease.

lesions in the auditory canal. Whitish coating on tongue. Dry
oral mucosae. No pharyngeal, buccal, or sublingual lesions.
Neck: Soft, supple, full range of motion.
Nodes: No cervical adenopathy.
CV: RRR, normal S1 and S2, no m/r/g.
Pulm: Symmetric bibasilar crackles, otherwise clear to
auscultation posteriorly bilaterally.
Abd: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, active bowel sounds. No
[**Doctor Last Name 515**] sign or hepatosplenomegaly.
Back: No spinal tenderness.
GU: Mild right CVA tenderness, none on left.
Ext: No LE edema, 2+ DP pulses.
Neuro: CN II-XII intact. 5/5 strength (grip, biceps, triceps,
deltoids, iliopsoas, hamstrings, quads, and dorsi- and plantar
flexion) bilaterally. Sensation to light touch intact.
Skin: Numerous (20-30) erythematous, maculopapular,
non-blanching, slightly tender rounded lesions over the right
side of the torso from the nipple line to the waist line; the
lesions measure 5-10 mm in diameter. There are a handful of
similar lesions on the left side of the torso, and there are
patches of smaller, coalesced lesions over both nasolabial
folds. All of these lesions are similar in appearance. There are
no lower extremity or genital lesions. There are some
erythematous lesions over the upper back that appear more
chronic and are dissimilar in appearance; there are no other
lesions over the back. None of the lesions are fluid-filled. Non
vescular and atypical for varicella.

CT Chest:
New diffuse bilateral ground glass opacification with associated
reticulation, highly concerning for an acute infectious process,
but the absence of nodules is atypical for varicella pneumonia.
PCP should be considered as well as [**Month/Day/Year 1074**]/other viral pneumonias.
Non-infectious etiologies including pulmonary hemorrhage, acute
intersititial pneumonia, hydrostatic edema, and drug reaction
are also possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
