History of Present Illness:
Mr [**Known lastname 91849**] is a 66 year old male with history of COPD, recurrent
pneumonias in setting of Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**], multiple sclerosis, and
recurrent aspiration.  He was admitted on [**5-15**] to the MICU for
hypoxemia and hypotension.
.
Per previous notes, he has a history of recurrent aspiration
pneumonias of unclear etiology - he has a G tube in place
through which he gets tube feeds nightly. He does not take any
PO feeds currently. His history is significant for esophageal
dysmotility of unclear etiology; furthermore, he carries a
diagnosis of Churg [**Doctor Last Name 3532**] vasculitis and multiple sclerosis. He
also has COPD and is on 2 L of oxygen at home that he uses
inconsistently. In the past, he also had a pulmonary embolus for
which an IVC filter was placed.
.
His prior history of his recurrent pneumonia is as follows,
taken from hospital records: in early spring of [**2169**], the
patient was well enough to have a vacation in the [**Country 13622**]
Republic, swimming, etc. Over the past 16 months, however the
patient has had multiple bouts of pneumonia that number 15-20.
He first presented in the spring of [**2169**] with cough, shortness
of breath, yellow thick sputum, chest tightness, weakness and
wheezing. He was treated with antibiotics and prednisone with a
presumptive diagnosis of pneumonia and improved, only to have a
relapse of symptoms within days to week or so. This happened
several times in the spring of [**2169**] and by mid spring of last
year, he was noted to have high levels of peripheral eosinophils
as well as eos in his sputum (BAL [**7-/2169**]), and the patient was
treated for worms given his exposure abroad.  In the summer of
[**2170**], given gastroesophageal reflux disease and significant
esophageal dysmotility, potentially leading to his recurrent
pneumonias, a decision was made to place a G-tube, through which
he now gets his tube feeds and medications. Several motility and
EGD studies have not revealed a clear cause for his dysmotility.
 Recently he was hospitalized for an aspiration event and was
treated with levofloxacin
.
Currently he lives at [**Hospital3 2558**], where he has been in
rehabilitation over the past 1 year. On the day of admission, he
developed a fever to 101; the night prior he said he felt short
of breath after his evening tube feed. He says his aspiration
events occur at night, after he lays down, following his G tube
feedings.
.
In the ED, his systolic blood pressure fell to 89; he had 2 L of
fluid given with improvement in his pressure to 100 systolic. He
was placed initially on a nonrebreather which was quickly weaned
to a venti-mask, his saturations in the low 90s. Chest x-ray was
obtained showing bilateral lower lobe infiltrates that remain
unchanged from prior chest x-ray and likely are secondary to his
underlying eosinophilic process.
.
In the MICU, the patient was stabilized with fluids, supportive
oxygen supplementation, and vancomycin + zosyn for coverage of
HCAP. His outpatient pulmonologist was consulted and the
suspician was for aspiration pneumonia related to tube feeds as
a precipitation for this acute presentation.  The plan was for
48 hours of IV antibiotics, with conversion to PO if tolerated
for an additional 5 day course.  The patient has a history of
chronic lower back pain on morphine, however this was held out
of concern for respiratory failure. Nutrition was consulted for
help to minimize aspiration events.
.
On the floor, patient is without complaint. His back pain has
returned, and he would like morphine. He feels his breathing has
improved since admission. he is still coughing, productive of
some sputum. Denies f/c/s, shortness of breath.  He also notes
some chronic b/l lower leg pain.

.
[**5-16**] CXR:
There is significant bibasal infiltrate, much of which is linear
suggesting an atelectatic component. While that in the left
lower lung zone has improved somewhat compared to prior study,
that on the right is unchanged, though not worsened. Poor
inspiratory effort and low lung volumes. Allowing for
projection, the heart size is normal. The remainder of the lung
parenchyma is grossly clear.
  CONCLUSION:
Low lung volumes, with bibasal infiltrates. There is probably a
large
atelectatic component as an additional finding of note. Minor
interval
improvement over prior study.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY:  Mr [**Known lastname 91849**] is a 66 year old male with history of COPD,
recurrent pneumonias in setting of Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**], multiple
sclerosis, and recurrent aspiration, admitted to MICU [**5-15**] and
treated for aspiration pneumonia.
.
# Cough/Fever: Given his history, the most likely etiology was
aspiration pneumonia vs pneumonitis, as time course and
presentation fits with this.  He was initially treated with IV
antibiotics, and subsequently transitioned to a course of PO
augmentin, on which he improved. He was also given nebulizer
treatments.
.
# Chronic lung disease: Patient has suspected Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**], for
which he is on a prednisone taper, and azathioprine.  He was
continued on his original Prednisone taper set forth prior to
this admission by his outpatient Pulmonologist. He also
continued on Bactrim for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].  He also has OSA, and
CPAP was continued.
.
# Weight loss, eosinophila:  [**Month (only) 116**] be explained by Churg-[**Doctor Last Name 3532**],
however there is a concern for potential underlying malignancy.
The patient will follow-up with his outpatient pulmonologist,
who will consider referral to hematology oncology. This was
discussed with the pulmonologist and patient.
.
# Bipolar disease - continued quetiapine and citalopram
.
# Hyperlipidemia - continued pravastatin
.
# Back pain, leg pain - continued gabapentin, morphine, fentanyl

.
# Hypothyroidism - continued levothyroxine
.
# Multiple sclerosis - continued immunosuppression as above
.
