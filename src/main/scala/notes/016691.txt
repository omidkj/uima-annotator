                            **FINAL REPORT [**2139-1-13**]**

   URINE CULTURE (Final [**2139-1-13**]):    NO GROWTH.

[**2139-1-10**] - blood cultures negative to date.

CXR: FINDINGS: A single portable chest radiograph is available
for review with the patient in lordotic positioning. There are
low lung volumes. The heart size appears at the upper limits of
normal. No focal consolidation or evidence of pulmonary edema is
present. There is again noted exaggerated kyphosis and
degenerative change at the left acromioclavicular joint.

IMPRESSION: No consolidation or evidence of acute congestive
heart failure

US kidney: Normal renal ultrasound. Bladder not evaluated given
lack of urinary distention.

Brief Hospital Course:
# Delirium, somnolence: Resolved by discharge. It was
multifactorial from hypercarbia, recent increase in morphine SR
dose to 30 mg [**Hospital1 **] and increase in cymbalta dose by PCP,
[**Name Initial (NameIs) 58875**]/ARF, tylenol PM intake prior to admission.Advised to
void non prescription sedating meds unless suggested by MD.
Morphine dose decreased as below.

# ARF: was likely hypovolemic and was improving by discharge.
Lasix and lisinopril were held. Lisinopril restarted eventually.
.
# Acute hypercarbic resp failure: Resolved with supportive care.
Likely hypercarbic at baseline from COPD, severe pulm HTN:
- continued spiriva, albuterol, advair, Outpt sleep / pulmonary
follow-up is recommended
- Pt may benefit from pulmonary rehab

# Constipation - resolved with aggressive bowel regimen.

# Hypertension: Amlodipine added; metoprolol continued.
Eventually lisinopril restarted

# CAD, chronic diastolic heart failure: on ASA, beta blocker,
ezetimibe, lisinopril.
- cardiology follow up in clinic scheduled.

# Anxiety/depression: cymbalta, trazodone continued
- Discussed with daughter, patient was taking ativan but per PCP
recommendations ativan was being weaned off. This week she would
have stopped ativan. Benzodiazepine withdrawal could be a
potential reason for high BP. Low dose ativan was suggested if
BP is high and there is a concern of benzo withdrawal.

# Chronic pain: morphine SR at lower dose continued.

She was initially treated in ICU and then sent to floor. Patient
eager to be transferred to [**Hospital3 **]med center closer to
home where her family can visit her easily. However, they did
not have a bed. The patient and daughetr both decided to leave
AMA on [**2139-1-13**]. It was recommended that patient stay till PT
evaluation, BP is better controlled and till an ambulatory sat
with PT is obtained. However, the preferred to leave. It is
strongly advised that patient see her pcp and pulmonologist
[**Name9 (PRE) 2678**].

# Code status: discussed with pt, would like aggressive
measures, but if not reversible, would like to have aggressive
care removed; encouraged to discuss with daughter, [**Name (NI) 14880**]
