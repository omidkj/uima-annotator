Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1171**]
Chief Complaint:
cough and fatigue

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Aortic valvuloplasty


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 110111**] is an 88M with severe aortic stenosis, diastolic
heart failure, moderate pulmonary hypertension, stage IV chronic
kidney disease, and bronchiectasis with several months of cough
w/ trace hemoptysis. He came to the ED today b/c his cough is
occuring more frequently and continues to be blood tinged. He
has midline chest pain associated with the cough without
radiation.
.
He has chronic exertional CP and SOB with ambulating 10 meters
which he states is unchanged: this has been attributed to his
severe AS in the past.
.
In terms of his bronchiectasis (radiographically mild) and
hemoptysis, he has been seen in pulmonary clinic. He had MAC on
an AFB smear in the fall of [**0-0-**] which he refused treatment for
and which did not appear on 3 serial AFB smears in [**November 2126**].
Differential for his hemoptysis includes bronchiectasis vs
severe valvular dz w/ subsequently increased filling pressures.

.
In the ED vitals were 98.4, 173/96, 64, 18, 100% 3LNC. EKG
unchanged. BNP elevated. CXR with stable effusion and no overt
pulmoanry edema. He was given aspirin 325 x1 and lasix 20 IV as
his JVP appeared elevated.

.
[**2127-3-15**] CT head: No acute intracranial abnormality. In case of
continued clinical concern for infarction, an MRI can be
obtained.
[**2127-3-15**] CT abd/pelvis: 1. 8.0 x 4.6 x 5.8 cm hematoma in the
right groin just deep to the femoral vessels with surrounding
fat stranding. Evaluation for active extravasation cannot be
done due to lack of IV contrast. 2. Multiple stable pancreatic
cysts.
[**2127-3-14**] Echo: There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
The left ventricular cavity is unusually small. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%); outflow tract obstruction cannot be
excluded and is probably present. The number of aortic valve
leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. Significant aortic stenosis is
present (not quantified). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The severity of aortic regurgitation may be underestimated
due to the technically limited nature of this study. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial
effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2126-11-26**], no definite change.
[**2127-3-14**] Post Aortic Valvuloplasty Echo: There is symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is small.
Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%).
Mild to moderate ([**12-21**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
severity of aortic regurgitation may be underestimated. There is
no pericardial effusion.
.
[**2127-3-12**] CXR: Relatively stable pleural effusion as previously
documented.
There is improved aeration of the lung bases with only mild
residual opacities remaining, likely atelectasis.
.
[**2127-3-16**]: Right Femoral U/S IMPRESSION: No evidence of aneurysm
in the right groin. No discrete organizing fluid collection also
identified. The area of known hematoma is likely intramuscular
and not well appreciated on this study


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 110111**] is a 87 yo male with severe aortic stenosis, dCHF
with preserved EF, PAH, CKD, HTN, chronic cough/hemoptysis who
presents with worsening cough and chest pain associated with
cough. Physical exam on admission was suggestive of mild fluid
overload.
.
# COUGH/HEMOPTYSIS: Acute worsening of chronic cough is main
presenting symptom. Pt previously grew out MAC (untreated) and
has been diagnosed with bronchiectasis and chronic lung disease.
His presenting complaint of worsened cough with assoc CP was
most suggestive of a bronchiectasis flare. Patient was treated
with Ciprofloxacin for 7 days (he completed 3 days of his course
at time of discharge). Patient's cough was managed with tesalon
pearls and robitussin with some symptomatic relief.
.
# Chest pain: Chest pain really only occurred in the setting of
cough. He was noted to have a Trop of 0.04 in setting of CKD
which is consistent with his prior troponin. Patient refused
additional sets of enzymes, but his symptoms were felt to be
very unlikely ACS. He was discharged on aspirin, statin &
metoprolol.
.
# CHF: Patient was gently diuresed with lasix until euvolemic.
He should continue on a low dose of furosemide 20mg daily.  He
will need teaching regarding daily volume assessment and
weights.
.
# Aortic stenosis: Patient underwent a valvuloplasty with a
decrease in mean gradient from 45mmHg to 20mmHg.  He was
transferred to CCU post procedure for low blood pr
