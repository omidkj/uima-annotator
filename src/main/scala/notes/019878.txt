Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 848**]
Chief Complaint:
Confusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
62 y.o. male with recent admission to [**Hospital1 18**] Trauma Service
after a fall down stairs while inebriated.  At the time, the
patient was initially seen as an outside hospital, and was
transported to [**Hospital1 18**] via helicopter.  During the flight, the
patient reportedly had a VF arrest lasting approximately 4 mins
with ROSC after epinephrine and CPR only.

He was initially intubated and sedated in the T-SICU. During his
hospital admission to [**Hospital1 18**], he was found to have a diffuse
subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage, a SDH, a right
scapular fracture, and multiple right lateral rib fractures.

In the T-SICU, the patient was placed on a CIWA scale for
anticipated alcohol withdrawal.  The patient did have periods of
delirium responsive to large amounts of benzodiazepines.  His
mental status improved, though he continued with poor balance
throughout his hospitalization.  He was discharged to
rehabilitation on [**2160-10-23**].

The patient reportedly was sent back to the emergency department
at [**Hospital3 **] from rehab for "increasing confusion and
lethargy."  He received 2 units of pRBCs, though it is unclear
if
this occurred at [**Hospital6 5016**] or at rehab. At the OSH,
he
was found to be febrile to 101.4, diagnosed with a RLL
pneumonia,
and started on antibiotic therapy.  He was subsequently
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] and admitted to the MICU team.

Patient reports last alcohol use prior to his previous
admission.

Pertinent Results:
UCx, Blood Cx sent in ED
.
STUDIES:
Head CT [**2160-10-25**] : 1. A 1 cm hypodense CSF attenuation of
subdural collection overlying the left
hemisphere, with rightward shift of 4 mm and decreased size of
the right
extra-axial space.
  2. Right posterior parenchymal hemorrhage similar or slightly
increased in size with surrounding edema.
  3. Bilateral parieto-occipital subarachnoid hemorrhage,
overall decreased
from [**2160-10-18**].

[**2160-10-25**] MRI Head :
 Since the prior examination, there is slight increase in size
of
what is likely a left cerebral hemispheric subdural hygroma
causing mild
effacement of the cerebral sulci, but no shift of normally
midline structures.
The hemorrhages seen in the region of the septum pellucidum
appear to have
resolved but there is persistence of the small right parietal
hemorrhage with surrounding edema, as well as the FLAIR images
showing what is likely subacute subarachnoid hemorrhage. There
are no abnormalities on the diffusion images to suggest acute
brain ischemia. There is no hydrocephalus or shift of normally
midline structures.

The principal vascular flow patterns are identified. There is
redemonstration of a small, polypoid area of mucosal thickening
in the mid-ethmoid sinus on the right side.

CONCLUSION: Mild increase in size of left cerebral convexity
subdural
hygroma. See above report for additional findings.

[**2160-10-31**]

IMPRESSION: Normal CT angiography of the head.

CT VENOGRAPHY OF THE HEAD: CT venography of the head
demonstrates no evidence
of vascular occlusion or thrombosis within the superior sagittal
and
transverse sinuses.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of dural sinus thrombosis.

MRI [**2160-10-31**]
IMPRESSION:
1. Over the series of studies, and in direct comparison to the
[**10-25**] MR, there
has been no definite increase in the size of the ventricles to
specifically
suggest the development of hydrocephalus; moreover, there is no
evidence of
transependymal migration of CSF.
2. Persistent small amount of small subarachnoid hemorrhage at
the
bihemispheric vertex, with expected evolution of the right
frontovertex
hemorrhagic contusion, but no other hemorrhage seen.
3. Now only a thin and progressively FLAIR-hyperintense subdural
collection,
layering over only the most anterior aspect of the left frontal
convexity;
this measures only 3.5 mm in maximal thickness and demonstrates
no mass effect
on the subjacent brain; there is only at most 1 mm rightward
shift of
normally-midline structures.
4. No evidence of acute infarction.

EEG [**2160-10-30**]
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations.
Routine
sampling showed a mildly slow [**7-6**] Hz theta frequency background
suggestive of a mild to moderate encephalopathy. There were also

occasional generalized bursts of slowing. There were no
epileptiform
features noted. A large portion of this study was interrupted by

electrod
