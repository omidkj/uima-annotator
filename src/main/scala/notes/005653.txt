History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 61 year-old male admitted with fevers 102.6,
leukocytosis and Congestive Heart failure SOB and weakness.  An
echocardiogram revealed endocarditis with vegetation seen on the
mitral leaflet. His blood cultures x2 with gram postive cocci in
pairs and chains. OSH urine culture Enterococcus.Cardiac surgery
consulted for surgical correction.

Past Medical History:
Endocarditis
mental disability: paramnesia (used to hear voices)
Myopic
Past Surgical History: none


Social History:
Lives alone in "complete isolation." Estranged from his two
sisters and both his parents are deceased. He is unemployed and
disabled from prior mental illness "paramenesia" and used to
have auditory hallucinations. He spends his days working on his
"project" which is [**Location (un) 1131**] philosophers such as [**Location (un) **] and [**Location (un) 5936**]
and taking notes and making analyses. No longer has
hallucinations. Quit smoking 15-20 years ago, was smoking [**12-20**]
pack of non-filters daily for 3 years. Drinks 12 beers in 24
hours once every 2 weeks. History of cocaine use "to investigate
the side effects of a friend who was using it". No illicit drugs
currently.

Family History:
father died of [**Name (NI) 6988**] disease age 47, mother died of a
cardiac arrythmia. health of sisters is unknown.

Physical Exam:
Admission Exam:
General: Alert, oriented, flat affect, cachetic with temporal
wasting
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear, EOMI, PERRL
Neck: supple, JVP mildly elevated, no LAD
CV: Irregular tachycardia, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs,
gallops
Lungs: Crackles at bases bilaterally, no wheeze
Abdomen: soft, RUQ with fullness and mild tenderness,
non-distended, bowel sounds present, no organomegaly
GU: foley
Rectal: external hemorrhoids, firm enlarged prostate, guaiac
negative brown stool
Ext: warm, well perfused, 2+ pulses, [**1-21**]+ pitting edema up to
knees bilaterally, no rashes
Neuro: CNII-XII intact, 5/5 strength upper/lower extremities,
grossly normal sensation, 2+ reflexes bilaterally,
finger-to-nose intact


Pertinent Results:
CT of Chest/Abd/Pelvis ([**2174-5-7**]):
IMPRESSION:
1.  Pulmonary edema. Please note that superimposed infection
cannot be
excluded. Follow-up after diuresis is recommended. No evidence
of pulmonary embolism.
2.  No CT evidence of malignancy in the torso.

Head MRI ([**2174-5-10**]):
IMPRESSION:
1.  Small area of acute infarct in the left parietal lobe.
Additional small areas of T2 shine-through in the right temporal
region with associated blood products and a subtle area of
enhancement.  These findings indicate a combination of acute
infarcts and subacute infarcts with blood products.  There is no
abscess identified or abnormal meningeal enhancement seen.
2.  Diffuse decreased signal in the visualized bony structures
could be due to marrow hyperplasia or infiltration and clinical
correlation is recommended.
3.  No evidence of mass effect or hydrocephalus.

Spine MRI ([**2174-5-10**]):
IMPRESSION:
1.  No evidence of discitis or definite evidence of
osteomyelitis seen.
2.  Foci of signal abnormality within the T4 and L4 vertebral
bodies are
likely due to hemangiomas which have atypical appearance
secondary to diffuse bony abnormality secondary to marrow
hyperplasia or infiltration.  This foci are less likely
secondary to metastasis or foci of osteomyelitis given the
appearances on the post-gadolinium images.  However, a followup
study can confirm this suspicion.
3.  Diffuse low signal in the bony structures due to marrow
hyperplasia or
infiltration.
4.  No evidence of epidural abscess or spinal cord compression.
5.  Diffuse high signal on T2 images within the soft tissues
likely secondary to soft tissue edema.  Other findings as above.

.
Intra-op TEE [**2174-5-10**]
PREBYPASS: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%) with mild LV dilation. The ascending, transverse and
descending thoracic aorta are normal in diameter and free of
atherosclerotic plaque. There is a large vegetation on the
aortic valve. Severe (4+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is
a large vegetation on the mitral valve. Severe (4+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is a large vegetation on the
tricuspid valve attached to the TV subvalvular apparatus. There
is no significant pulmonic regurg and NO veg on the PV. Normal
PV leaflets. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
is a large right pleural effusion. The interatrial septum is
intact. There is no clot in the LAA. The coronary sinus appears
normal.

POSTBYPASS: Normally functioning AV, MV bioprosthesis. Mild TR.
No sig valvular stenosis or regurgitation. Mildly decreased LV
systolic function with LVEF = 40-45%. Otherwise unchanged.
