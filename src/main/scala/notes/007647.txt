Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Benadryl / Winrho Sdf / Heparin Agents

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 99**]
Chief Complaint:
hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
paracentesis

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 69 year-old lady with a h/o severe
valvulopathies s/p AVR/MVR/TVR with prolonged post-op course,
respiratory failure s/p trach, severe secondary pulmonary
hypertension, CHF, cirrhosis, renal failure, and ITP, presenting
from [**Hospital **] rehab with hypotension (SBPs in 70s) and
desaturations to the 80s (trached, on vent).  ABG at 4am:
7.35/42/58.  She received a dose of Levoquin prior to transfer.
.
Of note, she was recently discharged from [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2139-7-3**] after
her tri-valve replacement and long complicated post-op course.
She developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation that was controlled
with diltiazem but was not anticoagulated, and she developed
renal failure requiring hemodialysis.  She was found to have a
Klebsiella UTI and C.diff colitis, gram positive bacteremia, and
Serratia marcesans pna, so she completed full-course treatment
with Cipro, Flagyl, Vanc, and Cefepime.
.
In the ED, she was found to be hypotensive with SBPs in the 70s
(baseline SBP 90s), anuric, and without desaturations.  She also
had 1 episode of clear diarrhea.  It was noted that she had a
left subclavian line and right subclavian dialysis tunneled
line, both from her prior admission.  Lung exam showed crackles
and rhonchi on the right, clear on the left, and CXR showed
possible right-sided pna.  She received 3L of fluid, Vanc and
Flagyl, and was admitted to the MICU.
.

Past Medical History:
1. Severe valvulopathies, including aortic stenosis, mitral
regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation, now s/p AVR/MVR/TVR
on [**2139-5-21**].
2. Renal failure, dialysis dependent, developed after recent
surgery.  Pt now on HD qMWF.
3. Severe secondary pulmonary hypertension, on home oxygen
therapy at home 2.5 liters per minute. Her last pulmonary
pressures were 53/25/37 on catheterization in [**2138-9-21**].
Portopulmonary hypertension is felt to be a contributor.
4. Congestive heart failure, post-op echo with preserved
systolic
function (LVEF>55%) on [**2139-6-9**].
5. Longstanding diabetes type 2, last hemoglobin A1c 5.9 on
[**2139-5-20**].
6. Liver cirrhosis, followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 34448**], presumed
secondary to NASH with contribution from cardiac cirrhosis,
complicated by ascites, splenomegaly, and varices on EGD
[**2139-1-22**] (grade 2 and one grade [**12-23**] in the distal 3-4 cm of the
esophagus).  Childs class B cirrhosis.
7. ITP, compounded by severe liver disease and splenomegaly,
followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6944**]. No response to IVIG, low and high dose
Prednisone therapy, and life-threatening intravascular hemolysis

following WinRho. On no therapy at present.
8. Osteoporosis, on Fosamax.
9. Basal Cell Carcinoma.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
ICU course: 69-yo woman with h/o severe valvulopathies s/p
AVR/MVR/TVR with prolonged post-op course, severe secondary
pulmonary hypertension, CHF, cirrhosis, and ITP, presented with
hypotension (SBPs in 70s) and probable sepsis in the setting of
multiple possible etiologies.
.
## Hypotension: of unknown etiology, DDx includes infectious
(including UTI, pna, colitis, line infxn, SBP) vs. cardiogenic
- fluid boluses for SBP<90, goal MAP>60, CVP 12
- if refractory to fluids, start Levophed, consider vasopressin
for synergy
- hold anti-hypertensives (nadolol, furosemide, spironolactone)
for SBP<90
- place arterial line
- check ECG, serial cardiac enzymes
- check Blood Cx, UA/Urine Cx, Stool Cx/C.diff, Sputum Cx
- diagnostic paracentesis for possible SBP: send cell count with
diff, fluid cx, total protein, albumin, total bili
- TTE to rule-out endocarditis
- check mixed venous O2, lactate, [**Last Name (un) 104**] stim
- continue Abx: Vanc, Zosyn, Flagyl
- consider discontinue left SC, right HD tunneled line
- consider placing left IJ / PICC
.
## Respiratory failure: consider pna given pt's history of
desaturations and hypotension as well as exam and CXR findings,
although pt is afebrile; also consider cardiogenic failure given
complex hx and recent cardiac surgery
- continue broad-spectrum abx for possible pna
- check sputum cx, blood cx
- check ECG, serial cardiac enzymes
- pt already with trach
- Mech Vent on AC: 400x16/0.50/5.0
- wean as tolerated
.
## Renal failure: no acute need for HD/CVVH
- renal following, consider d/c HD tunneled line
- renal-dose meds
- avoid renal toxins
- consider UTI given pt's history of Klebsiella UTI on prior
admission
- check UA/Urine Cx, blood cx
- continue broad-spectrum abx
.
## Coagulopathy: pt with h/o ITP with cirrhosis and splenomegaly
- give ddAVP, 1U platelets, 2U FFP for procedures
- continue to monitor, correct as necessary
- contact pt's hematologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6944**]
.
## Cirrhosis: presumed [**1-23**] NASH with cardiac congestion
- check LFTs
- continue rifaximin
- discuss with Liver team/contact pt's hepatologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
- 69 y.o. female with NASH cirrhosis, ITP, s/p multivalve repair
admitted with hypotension and leukocytosis concerning for
sepsis. Currently in the ICU with massive amount of ascites,
negative for SBP.
-Plan for therapeutic tap once no longer on pressors and
hemodynamically stable.

.
## DM2:
- RISS
- consider insulin drip if BS>200
.
## CHF:
- check serial cardiac enzymes
- daily ECGs
- TTE tomorrow to rule-out endocarditis, assess LVEF
.
## FEN/GI: NPO except meds, replete lytes PRN, folic acid, iron
## Prophylaxis: PPI/H2-blocker, pneumoboots, bowel regimen
## Access: left SC, right dialysis tunneled line, right arterial
line
## Communication and Code Status: Communicating with the patient
and her daughter [**Name (NI) **].  Notably on the mo
