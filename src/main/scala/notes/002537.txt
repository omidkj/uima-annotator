SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is married.  He denies any
history of alcohol, tobacco, or drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed the patient was afebrile, his blood
pressure was 164/58, his heart rate was in the 70s (following
temporary pacemaker placement), his respiratory rate was 20,
[**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure [**6-22**] with an FIO2 of 60%,
and saturating 100%.  The physical examination was notable
for an irregular rhythm with normal first heart sounds and
second heart sounds.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops were
appreciated.  Extremity examination revealed no lower
extremity edema was present on examination.  Chest
examination revealed crackles in the lungs bilaterally.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram on admission
revealed complete heart block with a rate of 30 and possible
anterior fascicular block.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
were notable for a creatinine of 4 and a potassium of 6.2.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The
patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit.

In the Emergency Department, prior to transfer to the
Coronary Care Unit, a temporary pacemaker was placed.  The
patient was also placed on [**Hospital1 **]-level positive airway pressure
to assist with ventilation.

The following morning, the patient was taken for pacemaker
placement.  The patient received a [**Company 1543**] SDR 303B
dual-chamber rate-responsive pacemaker.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.

Following the procedure, the patient was sent back to the
Coronary Care Unit for further monitoring.  Following
pacemaker placement his heart rate remained stable in the 60s
with a systolic blood pressure ranging from the 120s to the
140s.

Due to his congestive heart failure and mild left ventricular
systolic dysfunction, the patient was diuresed with Lasix.
The patient required multiple blood pressure medications to
control his hypertension.  He was also continued on aspirin,
statin, and beta blocker due to his history of coronary
artery disease.  The patient was not placed on an ACE
inhibitor due to his elevated creatinine over his baseline.
His creatinine remained stable between 3.7 and 4 throughout
his hospitalization.  However, his creatinine was elevated
from his previous known baseline of 3.

Following the pacemaker placement procedure, the patient was
restarted on his home insulin scheduled of 70/30.  It was
found to cause excessive nocturnal hypoglycemia.  His evening
insulin dose was decreased, and he had no further problems
with his blood sugars.

On hospital day four, the patient was found to have an
episode of shaking chills.  He was afebrile, and his white
blood cell count was elevated.  Blood cultures and urine
cultures were obtained but did not grow anything.  Due to
concern for possible pacemaker pocket infection, the patient
was started on intravenous vancomycin; however, there were no
signs of infection at pacemaker site.  Prior to discharge,
the patient was switched to a by mouth antibiotic.

Prior to discharge, the patient was given an injection of
Epogen 7500 units for anemia of chronic disease and chronic
renal insufficiency.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS: The patient's discharge status was to home
with home physical therapy.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:

2.  Status post pacemaker placement.

5.  Coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery
bypass graft and stent from prior hospitalization.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
8.  Chronic renal insufficiency.
9.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.
 2.  Zantac 150 mg by mouth twice per day
