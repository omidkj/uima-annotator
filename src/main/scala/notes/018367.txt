Pertinent Results:
[**2129-7-26**] TEE:
Pre-Bypass:
The left atrium is normal in size.
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction in the inferior wall.
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic root, arch, and descendcing aorta are mildly dilated.
There are simple atheroma throughout the aorta.
The aortic valve is bicuspid. There is a probable vegetation on
the aortic valve. An aortic annular abscess is seen. There is an
aoritc root abcess cavity measuring 1.1cmx0.5cm adjacent to the
anterior mitral valve leaflet.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen.

Post Bypass #1:
Patient is AV paced on phenylepherine infusion. Aortic
prosthesis is well seated witout paravalular leaks. Peak
gradient 20, mean 12 mm Hg. There is a [**1-23**]+ jet of eccentric MR
directed posteriorly. Jet improves to [**12-24**]+ when pacing paused
and sbp <100, but worsens to 3+ in sinus rhythm with SPB 120.

Post Bypass #2:
Patient is AV paced (later a paced) on phenylepheine infusion.
There is a mechanical posthesis in the Mitral valve position
with normal washing jets and good leaflet motion, but without
paravalular leaks. Mean gradient 5 mm Hg. Aortic valve
prosthesis unchanged. Aortic contours unchanged. LVEF preserved
and at baseline. Remaining exam unchanged. All findings
discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at the time of the exam.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 56 year old man with a history of hypertension who
presented to an outside hospital on [**2129-7-24**] with acute mental
status changes and fevers, transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
workup. A lumbar puncture was performed which showed elevated
WBCs in the aseptic meningitis range with a monocytic
predominance, cultures negative. On admission he also had acute
kidney injury, elevated liver function tests, a troponin of 0.3
and a total creatinine kinase of [**2116**] (troponin was felt
secondary to rhabdo by cardiology). Initially he was treated as
bacterial meningitis on
vancomycin/ceftriaxone/ampicillin/acyclovir. His hospital course
was significant for MSSA bacteremia, vanc/CTX discontinued per
infectious disease, septic right shoulder s/p washout in the
operating [**2129-7-25**], also for transient diplopia  likely due
to multiple septic emboli seen on MRI, diplopia now resolved.
Remained on nafcillin/acyclovir as HSV PCR. He was getting
routine EKGs daily for PR monitoring in setting of possible
endocarditis. A TEE confirmed aortic vale vegetation and aortic
root abscess.  During his cardiac catheterization he developed
heart block and a temporary wire was placed.  He went urgertly
to the operating room and underwent : 1)Coronary artery bypass
grafting x 2 with left internal mammary artery to left anterior
descending artery and reverse saphenous vein graft to the obtuse
marginal artery. 2)Pericardial patch of aortomitral curtain
abscesses x 2.
3) Aortic valve replacement with a 25 mm On-X mechanical valve,
serial number [**Serial Number 112311**], reference number [**Serial Number 42227**]. 4) Mitral valve
replacement with a 27/29 mm On-X mechanical valve serial
#[**Serial Number 112312**], reference number [**Serial Number **]. Please see operative note for
further details.
Overall the patient tolerated the long procedure well and
post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  He was initally
on Neosynepherine and in AJR with occasional PAC's. This drug
was weaned off and he maintained a junctional rhythm but with
stable hemodynamics.  He extubated POD#1 without difficulty. The
patient was neurologically intact. He returned to SR with
frequent PAC's, Beta blocker was started slowly on POD#3. CT and
PW were remove wihtout difficulty. He was very fluid overloaded
and was started on lasix. His creatine rose to 1.7 and diureses
was adjusted. He tranferred to the floor on POD#6. On the floor
he developed rapid afib and was started on Amiodarone. Presently
he is in rate controlled afib. He was started on anticoaulation
for double mechanical valve goal INR 3.0-3.5.  He was febrile in
the post-op period and was pan cultured, all cultures returned
negative. His shoulder culture grew out MSSA and he was followed
by infectious disease, the nafacillin was continued which he
will need to remain on for total of 6 weeks from surgery. The
acyclovir was discontinued. His right shoulder wound remained
clean, dry, and intact. He developed a decubitus to coccyx/left
upper buttocks area. The patient was evaluated by the physical
therapy service for assistance with strength and mobility, he is
weak and deconditioned.  By the time of discharge on POD 8 the
patient needed assistance with walking. The upper pole of his
sternum drained small amount of serosanguinous drainage and
should be painted daily with betadine until resolved. His pain
is controlled with oral analgesics.   The patient was discharged
to North Eastern [**Hospital1 **] in [**Location (un) 701**] in good condition with
appropriate follow up instructions.
