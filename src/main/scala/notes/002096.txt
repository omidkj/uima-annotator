OSH STUDIES:
- [**2158-5-10**] CXR - per report - chronic lung disease with right lung
disease suggestive of superimposed pneumonia
.
STUDIES:
- ECG [**2158-5-10**] - sinus rhythm with occasional PBCs, normal axis,
~100bpm, no acute ST change
- Echo [**6-14**] - EF 45-50% - normal LA; mild LV systolic
dysfunction with inferior / inferolateral hypokinesis; mild
global free wall HK; Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.
There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted with hypoxia, hypercarbia, and found to have
pneumonia on CXR superimposed on COPD. She did not tolerate
BiPap and was maintained on high flow mask. She was continued on
broad spectrum antibiotics and unfortunately continued to
desaturate and further decompensate on high flow mask. She
developed bradycardia and asystolic cardiac arrest and died
within 5 minutes. She was DNR/DNI as confirmed with the patient.
