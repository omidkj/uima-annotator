[**2182-4-2**] EKG
Baseline artifact. Sinus tachycardia. Consider right atrial
abnormality. Low limb lead QRS voltage. Indeterminate axis. Late
precordial QRS transition. Findings suggest chronic pulmonary
disease. Clinical correlation is suggested. Since the previous
tracing of [**2181-4-13**] there is probably no significant change but
baseline artifact makes comparison difficult.

[**2182-4-2**] CXR
AP and lateral radiographs of the chest are partially obscured
by
overlying tubes. Changes of left upper lobectomy are seen with
left hilar
clips, scarring, volume loss, and compensatory hyperexpansion.
There are new opacities in the right middle lobe, probably
representing pneumonia, or less likely aspiration. There is no
pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable. Note is made
of
calcifications in the aortic arch. An IVC filter is noted in the
upper
abdomen.

Multiple old rib fractures are noted on the right. The remainder
of the
osseous structures and soft tissues appear unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: New right middle lobe opacities consistent with
pneumonia versus aspiration.

.
[**2182-4-4**] CXR

FINDINGS: Single bedside AP examination labeled "semi-upright at
8:40 a.m." is compared with two views of [**2182-4-2**]. Again
demonstrated is evidence of underlying emphysema with bullous
changes involving both lung apices, as well as past left upper
lobectomy with architectural distortion and volume loss
involving the left lung. There is now more confluent airspace
opacity involving the mid-right lung base, which may represent
organizing pneumonia of the right middle lobe; the remainder of
this lung is clear. The distorted cardiomediastinal silhouette
is unchanged and there is no pleural effusion or pulmonary
vascular congestion. Again demonstrated are the IVC filter and
gas-filled bowel loops in the upper abdomen.

IMPRESSION:

1. Persistent findings involving the right lung base, not
clearly present on [**2182-1-16**], suggestive of organizing pneumonia.

2. Underlying bullous emphysema, status post left upper
lobectomy.
.
[**2182-4-4**] PORTABLE ABDOMEN

FINDINGS: Multiple nondistended air-filled loops of small and
large bowel are present throughout the abdomen. There is a large
amount of stool within the large bowel, predominantly within the
ascending colon. An IVC filter is present at the level of the L2
vertebral body. There is a density overlying the region of
