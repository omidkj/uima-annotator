History of Present Illness:
84 year old gentleman with know aortic stenosis who has been
followed by serial echocardiograms. A recent echocardiogram in
[**Month (only) 1096**] suggested that the severity of his aortic stenosis had
increased and his left ventricular function had decreased form
55-60% to 45-50%. In anticipation of surgery, he was referred
for
a cardiac catheterization which revealed significant three
vessel
disease. He is symptomatic with dyspnea and chest pain with
exertion. He has now been referred for surgical evaluation.

Conclusions
PRE-CPB: 1. The left atrium is mildly dilated. No thrombus is
seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 40 %).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta. There are
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical
aortic valve stenosis (valve area <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The aortic annulus measures 19 mm.
6. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the resullts

POST-CPB: On infusion of phenylephrine. AV pacing for CHB.
Well-seated bioprosthetic valve in the aortic p[osition. No AI
or leak. MR is now trace. Preserved biventricular systolic
function. LVEF = 45%. The aortic contour is normal post
decannulation.
  I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2182-3-18**] Mr.[**Known lastname 88209**] was taken to the operating room and
underwent AVR(#21mm St.[**Male First Name (un) 923**] porcine)/Coronary artery Bypass
Grafting x 3 (left internal mammary artery grafted to left
anterior descending artery/ saphenous vein grafted to Obtuse
Marginal/Posterior Descending artery)with Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Cross
Clamp Time= 104 minutes. Cardiopulmonary Bypass Time= 130
minutes. Please see operative report for further details. He
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CVICU
intubated and sedated for further monitoring. Postoperatively,
he required atrial-ventricular pacing due to complete heart
block under the pacer. There were two postoperative episodes of
witnessed asystole requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation when
the temporary epicardial pacing wires did not capture. At the
bedside a temporary pacing swan was inserted. Postoperative
night #1 the temporary pacer wire also failed. Mr.[**Known lastname 88209**] was
placed on an Isuprel drip until a permanent pacemaker could be
inserted. [**3-19**] he was taken to the cath lab and underwent
placement of a permanenet pacemaker. Post procedure
Electrophysiology interrogated the PPM. POD#2 he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated without difficulty.
Beta-Blocker/statin/Aspirin and diuresis were initiated. He
continued to progress and was transferred to the step down unit
on POD#3 for further monitoring. Physical Therapy was consulted
for strength and mobilization. The remainder of his hospital
course was essentially uneventful and he was cleared for
discharge to [**Hospital **] health care center Rehabilitation on
POD#9. All follow up appointments were advised.
