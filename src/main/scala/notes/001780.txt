Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1505**]
Chief Complaint:
Dyspnea on exertion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2148-3-26**] Coronary Artery Bypass Graft x 4 (Left internal mammary
artery to left anterior descending, Saphenous vein graft to
diagonal, Saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal, Saphenous
vein graft to posterior descending artery)
[**3-29**] bronchosccopy-reintubated

History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] is a 71-year-old gentleman who experienced an
episode of congestive heart failure while in [**State 108**].  Work up
was notable for abnormal stress test and he underwent cardiac
catheterization, which was significant for severe three-vessel
coronary artery disease.  At the time of catheterization, there
was also notable for severe mitral regurgitation and an ejection
fraction of approximately 40%. Given these findings, he was
referred to me for cardiac surgical evaluation.  Currently, his
symptoms include a cough and dyspnea on exertion.

Past Medical History:
Coronary Artery Disease
Mitral Regurgitation
Hypertension
Hypercholesterolemia
Congestive heart failure
Tobacco abuse
Carotid disease
Subclinical hypothyroidism
Fatty liver
Kidney stones

Social History:
Retired. Quit smoking in [**2142**] after [**11-24**] ppd x 40 years. Denies
alcohol use.

Family History:
Brother died from myocardial infarction at age 52. Another
brother had bypass surgery at age 62

Physical Exam:
Vital signs: Pulse of 80, respirations of 16, and blood pressure
of 112/72.
In general, he was a well-developed and well-nourished male in
no acute
distress.  His skin was unremarkable.  His oropharynx was
benign.  He was noted to have poor dentition.  Neck was supple
with full range of motion.  There was no JVD.  Lungs were clear
to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart had a regular rate and
rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with a III/VI holosystolic murmur best
heard at the left lower sternal border and apex.  Abdomen was
benign.  Extremities were warm and well perfused without edema.
He had no varicosities of the greater saphenous vein.
Neurologically, he was alert and oriented x3.  Cranial nerves II
through XII were grossly intact.  He had 5/5 strength and no
focal deficits were appreciated.  His distal pulses were 2+ and
carotid bruits could not been appreciated secondary to his
cardiac murmur.

[**2148-3-25**] Echo: PREBYPASS: 1. The left atrium is moderately
dilated. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen
by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. 2. Left
ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. LV EF
is 60%. 3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. 4. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic
arch and descending thoracic aorta. Epiaortic imaging at the
site of cross clamping and aortic cannulation revealed simple
atheroma. 5. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and trace aortic
regurgitation. 6. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is partial mitral leaflet flail. Moderate to
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due to the eccentric
nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may be significantly
underestimated (Coanda effect). 7. There is no pericardial
effusion. 8. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was notified in person of the results
during the surgery on [**2148-3-25**] at 821. POSTBYPASS: 1. Patient is
on epinepherine and phenylepherine infusions. AV and later A
paced. 2. There is a mitral annuloplasty ring insitu with a
shortened posterior leaflet consistent with a mitral valve
repair. There is trace mitral regurgitation. Peak and mean
gradients are less than 6 mm hg. 3. There is preserved
biventricular function on low dose epinepherine infusion.
Initial septal diskinesis resolves when converted from AV to A
pacing. 4. Aortic contours are intact. 5. Remaining exam is
unchanged. 6. All findings are discussed with surgeons at the
time of the exam.

Final Report
STUDY: PA and lateral chest radiograph.
INDICATION: Patient is status post CABG, MVR, for evaluation.
TECHNIQUE: Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
COMPARISON: Radiograph is compared to [**2148-1-31**].
REPORT:
The patient is status post sternotomy and mitral valve repair as
well as LIMA grafting. There has been interval removal of a
right-sided central line. The patient's right-sided pneumothorax
probably effectively has resolved. There are persistent changes
along the left pleura superiorly likely representing a loculated
pleural process. Interestingly, the left lower lobe effusion has
somewhat improved and there is continued improved aeration in
the left lower lobe. A small amount of blunting in the right
costophrenic sulcus is unchanged. A right upper lobe opacity
persists and continued attention to this is recommended.
CONCLUSION:
Effective resolution of pneumothorax.
Improved postoperative changes in the right and left lung bases,
but with
worsening left apical opacity which is lobulated and broad-based
to the left pleura, suggesting pleural origin. Small right-sided
opacity for which continued followup is recommended.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was a same day admit after undergoing all
pre-operative work-up as an outpatient. On day of admission he
was brought to the operating room where he underwent a coronary
artery bypass graft x 3 and mitral valve repair. Please see
operative report for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the CVICU for invasive monitoring in stable
condition. Within 24 hours he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. He was weaned off Nitro and
Milrinone by post-op day two and was transferred to the
telemetry floor for further care. Chest tubes and epicardial
pacing wires were removed per protocol. He was gently diuresed
towards his preoperative weight. The physical therapy service
was consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and
mobility. He developed atrial fibrillation for which amiodarone
and coumadin were started. A chest x-ray revealed a right
pneumothorax which had increased in size. The interventional
pulmonology service was consulted who elected to place an
anterior chest tube (DART). The procedure was hemoptysis
requiring intubation. He was transferred back to the intensive
care unit and a chest tube was placed. A bronchoscopy revealed
fresh clot but patent airways. He developed hemodynamic
instability which was thought to be related to a blood
transfusion as his hemodynamics improved with steroids. A
transesophageal echocardiogram was without significant
abnormalities. As he fully stabilized, he was
