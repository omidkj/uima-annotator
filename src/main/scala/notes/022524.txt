History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]-year-old woman with h/o CAD s/p CABG, AF, [**11-25**]+ AR, 2+ MR, 3+
TR, moderate systolic pulm HTN, EF 40% transferred from [**Location (un) **]
for acute asthmatic bronchitis and CHF.  At baseline, patient is
ambulatory, no on oxygen and able to do most o
f her ADLs.  Patient present to OSH with nonproductive cough,
SOB and subjective fevers on [**2177-1-8**].  CXR was negative for
pneumonia.  EKG showed SVT and ST-T wave abnormalities.  BNP was
1357, TSH WNL.  Urine was negative for legionella and strep
pneumonia
 antigen.  She was admitted and placed on telemetry, and ruled
out for MI by cardiac enzymes.  She had a episode of respiratory
distress on [**1-9**] that resolved with IV lasix.  CXR on [**1-9**]
showed bibasilar opacities that may represent pneumonia.  She
was pla
ced on Cefuroxime 750 mg IV Q8 for acute asthmatic bronchitis.
CT chest on [**1-9**] with marked cardiomegaly  with both chamber
enlargement and findings suggestive of RHF, no PE or DVT, and
bilateral pleural effusions R> L, as well as a large hypodensity
in the liver. Cardiology was consulted and and echo was
performed, with the result not available at time of transfer.
She was placed on Albuterol and Atrovent which was switched to
xopenex and atrovent given tachycardia [**12-26**] to albuterol.  [**1-11**],
she was again found to be in respiratory distress which resolved
with 40 mg IV lasix.  Pulmonary was consulted, and xopenex was
d/c'ed and the patient was started on prednisone.  BP fell after
lasix, but returned to [**Location 213**] after a 250-300cc fluid bolus.

Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for [**Hospital 41518**] medical management.

Pertinent Results:
RADIOLOGY:
==========
CXR [**1-12**]: Heart size is within normal limits. There is
tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. There are possible small
bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectases but
correlate clinically and reevaluate on followup PA and lateral
chest films. No pulmonary edema or CHF. Status post CABG.
.
KUB [**1-12**]: No definite intestinal obstruction or other diagnostic
abnormalities
.
CT Abd [**1-14**]:
1. Large retroperitoneal hematoma on the left extending from the
kidney down to the pelvis, centered around the left psoas
muscle, pushing the kidney anteriorly. Fat planes are seen
between hematoma and aortic aneurysm. These findings likely
represent spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Given history
of right nephrectomy, if patient had history of renal cell
carcinoma, an underlying tumor could also be the source of
hematoma.

2. [**Hospital1 **]-lobulated intrathoracic aortic aneurysm. Associated
heavily calcified and ectatic aorta.

3. Bilateral small-to-moderate pleural effusions with associated
atelectasis.

4. Status post right nephrectomy.

5. Nonspecific focal area of increased attenuation within the
left kidney.

6. Calcifications are seen within the liver, spleen, kidney, and
mesentery consistent with history of granulomatous disease

CTA Chest from [**Hospital3 934**] on [**1-9**]
Impression: marked cardiomegaly with multichamber enlargement
and findings suggestive of right heart failure.  No evidence of
pulmonary embolus or DVT.  Large area of hypodensity in the
right lobe of the liver, ? technical.  Recommend abdominal CT
with delayed images to rule out liver mass.  Proximal abdominal
aortic 4.5 cm aneurysm which can also be evaluated with
abdominal CT.  Bilateral pleural effusion, right greater than
left.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted on [**1-12**] and was continued on atrovent and
prednisone for asthma exacerbation. Continued on ceftriaxone
initially for tx CAP->then changed to Levofloxacin, finishing a
full 7 day course of antibiotics started at the OSH.  Further
diuresis held due to intravascular depletion, though a BNP was
found to be 13,000 and an admission CXR showed small bilateral
pleural effusions.  On admission, she did have a PTT of 77,
though no report of being on heparin, and complained of LLQ
tenderness of palpation.  Her LLQ tenderness was attributed to
constipation as she stated she had not had a BM for a day, and
she was ordered a bowel regimen.
.
Respiratory status stabilized, however on [**1-14**] at noon, trigger
called for hct drop from 34 to 26. Hct dropped from 40 on
admission to OSH --> 36 on transfer --> 33 on admission here -->
26. Subsequently stablized at 26. Found to be trace guaiac
positive. Also complaining of LLQ quadrant and lower back pain.
ASA and plavix was stopped.  She had also been placed on SQ
heparin on admission for DVT prophylaxis and this was stopped.
Abd CT was ordered to evaluate for diverticulitis and RP bleed,
and found large RP bleed. Vascular surgery consulted given
finding of thoracic aortic aneurysn on abd CT for ? ruptured
aneurysm. However thoracics felt that ruptured aneurysm
unlikely. Appears to be separ
