History of Present Illness:
This is a 76 year old gentleman with a history of ischemic
cardiomyopathy (EF 20-30, AICD), NIDDM, CKD, chronic atrial
fibrilation (not on Coumadin because of prior fall and small
head bleed) who is being transferred from the [**Hospital3 3583**]
ICU for sepsis of unclear origin on pressors.

Current course of events begins when he was admitted to [**Hospital1 3325**] back in [**Month (only) 205**] for a nonhealing right foot ulcer after
failing outpatient course of Doxycycline. Patient has a history
of nonhealing foot ulcers (including 1 on left requiring
amputation of left 5th toe in [**2159**]). Wound cultures negative but
imaging at the time was concerning for osteomyelitis. He was
eventually discharged to rehab for 6 weeks of IV vanc/unasyn. He
did well during rehab and was ambulatory. Only issue which was
some mild diarrhea which was c diff negative and a transient
skin rash with resolved with topical treatment.

Less than 24 hours after going home (after completing his course
of antibiotics) he returned to the ED with severe malaise,
chills, fever and fatigue. On presentation to the OSH ED he had
a temp of 100.6, was HD stable, O2 sats 96%. Labs notable for
WBC of 12,000 with 10% bands and [**Last Name (un) **] with creatinine of 3.1 vs
2.5 the day prior (baseline 1.5-2.5). CXR normal. UA showed 2+
leuk est with 10-20 WBCs, budding yeast, and 1+ bacteria. He did
not have an indwelling catheter. He was admitted with possible
UTI and started on IV Cipro.

Since admission to [**Hospital 52510**] Hospital he has continued to
clinically decline. Progressive leukocytosis, fevers up to 104,
and worsening [**Last Name (un) **]. His [**Last Name (un) **] catheter was removed (tip
cultured, routine and fungal cultures still pending as of [**7-31**]).
Imaging showed evidence of osteomyelitis but overall it appeared
his ulcer clinically had improved after extended antibiotics. He
developed a progressive diffuse maculopapular rash with
associated pruritis.

He was transferred to the ICU on [**7-29**] for episodic hypotension
(to SBPs 60s-70s) associated with worsening labs and rash. Cipro
was stopped and he was started back on vanc/unasyn as well as on
IV fluconazole for concerns for systemic fungal infection
(recent broad spectrum antibiotics and budding yeast in urine).
Seen by ID (Dr. [**Name (NI) 52511**]). Repeat c diff testing was done
which was ultimately negative. Hypotension was fluid responsive
but after several boluses started neo (due to
tachycardia/AF/RVR).

In the 24 hours prior to transfer (on [**7-31**]) he continued to
clinically deteriorate. His antibiotics were changed to
daptomycin, aztreonam and voriconazole given concerns for
hypersensitivity reaction to prior antibiotics. All urine and
blood cultures were negative. While awaiting results of c diff
an abdominal CT showed gastric distention without signs of
colitis or other intraabdominal source of infection. His diffuse
rash persistent. Renal was consulted. Creatinine continued to
rise and he was given further IVF (on home diuretics at baseline
for CM).

His blood pressures continued to decline and a right IJ was
placed. Initial CVP was 17. He was started on neosynephrine. He
continued to have AF/RVR. Lactate elevated at 2.7. Venous
saturation 79%. Concern raised for AICD infection given
progressive course. Echo showed EF 25% and no "obvious sign of
infection of cardiac hardware".

No new complaints on the morning of transfer however his labs
continued to decline and were notable for a WBC count of 32,000
with 45% bands and a creatinine up to 5.1. Lactate unchanged at
2.6. His declining status was discussed with the family and it
was decided to transfer him to a tertiary care facility.

SBPs prior to transfer were in the 60s-70s on neo. He had made
only 30cc of urine overnight. During the 24 hours prior to
transfer at OSH his heart rates have mostly been in 120s, bursts
(especially with fevers) to 130s-140s, resolve with treating
temperature.

On arrival to the MICU he was severely ill-appearing and
confused. He had no specific complaints but was mumbling words
which were unintelligible. Within 30 minutes of arrival he
reported feeling much better and was alert and oriented to
place.

Review of systems:
(+) Per HPI
(-) Denies headache, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain,
chest pressure, palpitations, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
abdominal pain.

ago. Quit EtOH 30 years ago. Worked as a police officer and then
baliff. Retired in [**2157**].
