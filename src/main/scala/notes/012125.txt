Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a [**Age over 90 **] year old female
with a history of gastritis, hypertension and
hypercholesterolemia who was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] Service on
[**2145-5-6**] for the complaint of progressive chest pain.
The patient described a two to three month history of
progressive shortness of breath and substernal chest pain.
The patient stated that the chest pain originally occurred at
rest and reported that her episodes had become more severe
over the ensuing time.  The patient's episodes were
characterized by pain radiating to both arms that would
occasionally wake her up at night and lasted approximately 30
minutes in duration.  The patient was reportedly evaluated by
her primary care physician and was presumptively diagnosed
with gastritis; an esophagogastroduodenoscopy conducted on
[**2145-4-13**] demonstrated mild gastritis which resulted in
outpatient treatment with Maalox and Protonix prn.  The
patient continued to demonstrate worsening symptoms,
resulting eventually in a MIBI stress test on [**5-5**] which
demonstrated severe lateral wall reversible defects.  The
patient was subsequently advised to come immediately to the
Emergency Department at [**Hospital6 256**],
where she was noted to have ST depressions in leads 2, AVF,
V5 and 6 and an old T wave inversion in leads 1 and AVL.  The
patient was subsequently started on heparin and nitroglycerin
drip which brought immediate relief of her chest pain
symptoms and she was subsequently admitted to the Medicine
Service on [**5-6**] for further evaluation and treatment.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension; hypercholesterolemia;
colon cancer; status post colectomy; breast cancer;
peripheral vascular disease; gastritis; status post right
total hip repair; status post thyronodular excision.

HOME MEDICATIONS:  Sinemet; Levo Carbidopa; Lipitor;
Atenolol; Norvasc; Hydrochlorothiazide; Protonix; Benicar;
Timolol; Maalox; Tylenol; Multivitamin; calcium; fish oil.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Widowed and lives in [**Location 1439**] [**State 350**]
with daughter, formerly worked as a secretary and is now
retired.  No smoking and no alcohol history.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]
Service on [**2145-5-6**].  Initial inpatient therapy
included Aspirin, statins, heparin, and Nitroglycerin drip,
on which regimen the patient was noted to have significant
relief of her chest pain.  Cardiac catheterization performed
on [**2145-5-7**] demonstrated three vessel coronary artery
disease, moderate mitral regurgitation, moderate diastolic
ventricular dysfunction, and mild systolic ventricular
dysfunction.  A 30 cc intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted
without complication through the course of the procedure.
The patient's ejection fraction was noted to be approximately
50%.  Following catheterization, the patient was admitted to
the Cardiac Care Unit for further evaluation and management.
The patient was subsequently evaluated by the Cardiothoracic
Surgery Service and scheduled for urgent coronary artery
bypass graft on [**2145-5-10**].  On [**5-10**], the patient
underwent an off pump coronary artery bypass graft times one
with anastomosis of the left internal mammary artery to the
left anterior descending with a plan for postoperative
stenting.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without
complications.  The patient's pericardium was left open;
lines placed including an arterial line, Swan-Ganz catheter,
and intra-aortic balloon pump; wires placed included
ventricular pacer wires; two slits including mediastinal,
right and left pleural tubes.  On transfer to the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit, the patient
demonstrated a mean arterial pressure of 92, central venous
pressure of 0, PAD of 8 and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1052**] of 18.  The patient
demonstrated a heartrate of 84 in normal sinus rhythm.  Drips
on transfer included Neo 0.7 and Propofol at 10.  In the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit, the patient progressed
well clinically and was successfully extubated on
postoperative day #1, [**5-11**].  The patient was returned to
the Catheterization Laboratory on postoperative day #1, where
stents were placed both to the circumflex and ramus.  On
postoperative day #2, the patient was cleared for transfer to
the floor, at which point her IABP was removed and her cordis
was changed to a triple lumen catheter without complication.
The patient was subsequently admitted to the Cardiothoracic
Service on direction of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**].  Postoperatively
the patient progressed well clinically.  Physical therapy
evaluation recommended the patient for [**Hospital 5735**]
rehabilitation following discharge, after which point the
patient was successfully screened for placement.  On
postoperative day #4, the patient's chest tubes were removed
without complication; subsequent chest x-ray demonstrated no
evidence of pneuomothorax.  The patient was successfully
advanced to a regular p.o. diet and was noted to have
adequate pain control via oral pain medications.  On
postoperative day #5, [**2145-5-15**], the patient was cleared
for discharge to a rehabilitation facility with instructions
for follow up.
