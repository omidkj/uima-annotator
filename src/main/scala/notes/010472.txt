G-J tube unclogging


History of Present Illness:
71 year old female with COPD, chronic aspiration pneumonia
(Pseudomonas, MRSA) requiring intubation in past, recent admits
for aspiration pneumonia, presenting from home with fever,
productive cough with yellow sputum x 2 days, hypoxia to 75% on
home 2L NC, improved with 4L NC.  Patient's caretaker notes that
yesterday, patient had some mild dyspnea and intermittent
fevers, as well as continued productive cough.  Patient is on
[**2-5**] L O2 at baseline.  Fever was reportedly up to 102.4 F on the
night prior to admission and 100 F rectally this morning at home
after Tylenol.  There is no report of headache and neck
stiffness. Caregiver reports that patient is confused and can't
find words easily when she spikes a fever.  Patient has a J-tube
in place for feeding due to aspiration risk.  The patient's
caretaker notes that there  has been some increased purulent
drainage from the J-tube site over the last few days.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 88 133/63 10 93% NRB. Patient was
noted to be acutely dyspneic with a productive cough.  She was
answering questions appropriately but noted to be somewhat
somnolent. Rectal temperature was noted to be 100F.  EKG shows
SR@80, normal axis.  Portable CXR showed moderate pulmonary
edema, patchy bilateral infiltrates, stable elevation of L
hemidiaphragm, as well as worsening consolidation in the left
lower lobe.  Lactate was elevated to 3.0, and WBC elevated to
18.3.  She was given a dose of ceftriaxone and levofloxacin for
pneumonia as well as metronidazole because of possibility of
aspiration. She was also given a dose of 125mg IV
methylprednisolone for COPD exacerbation and combivent nebs.
Vitals in ED prior to transfer are as follows: 101.4F (Rectal)
98  131/68  20  93-96% on 4L NC.
.
On admission to ICU, patient is not reporting dyspnea.  Her
caretaker states that she is mildly confused, in conjunction
with when she spikes a fever.
.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**5-18**]
Continued moderate pulmonary edema, with possible superimposed
infection at the lung bases

TTE [**5-18**]
The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac
index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size
and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild to moderate ([**1-4**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation with normal valve
morphology. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function.
Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable
for review) of [**2190-5-4**], the severity of mitral regurgitation
has increased.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2191**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the
echo findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on
clinical and echocardiographic data.
.
CXR [**5-18**]-
Tip of the new left PIC line ends in the upper SVC. A component
of
interstitial edema has cleared from the right lung, revealing
pulmonary
fibrosis. Similar improvement at the left lung base could be due
to resolving pneumonia or atelectasis. Heart size is normal. No
pneumothorax. Pleural effusion is small if any.
.
Abdominal u/s-
FINDINGS: The abdominal wall and underlying soft tissues show
normal
echogenicity. There is no focal fluid collection seen. The
balloon of the
MIC G-tube appears well inflated lying under the gastric wall.
IMPRESSION: No focal abdominal wall fluid collection or abscess
seen.
.
KUB [**5-21**]-IMPRESSION: Gastrojejunostomy tube in similar position
compared to prior with tip likely within the proximal jejunum.
.
CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2195-5-22**]
There are low lung volumes with interval improvement of
interstitial edema
from prior study of [**2195-5-18**]. Pulmonary fibrosis is again noted.
Mild bibasilar opacity is similar from prior study, and may be
due to
atelectasis and/or pneumonia. The cardiomediastinal and hilar
contours are
stable.
