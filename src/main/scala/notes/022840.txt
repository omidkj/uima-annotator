was brought directly to the operating room where he underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels. Please see

procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring in stable condition. Later that day, sedation was
weaned, he awoke neurologically intact and was extubated. Chest
tubes were removed on post-op day one. Beta blockers and
diuretics were initiated. He was gently diuresed during his
post-operative course towards he pre-op weight. On post-op day
two he was transferred to the cardiac surgery step down floor.
His epicardial pacing wires were removed on post-op day three.
Physical therapy followed him during post-op course for
strengthening and mobility. He continued to improve with an
uncomplicated post-op course without any arrhythmias. He was
started on Iron and Vitamin C secondary to anemia. And was
