History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 53 yo spanish speaking female with a history of
panhypopituitarism, obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary artery
hypertension in the setting of a known ASD,
obesity-hypoventilation, and diastolic heart failure who
presented from home with fever 102F and headache. Pt has had
multiple hospitalizations, most recently [**1-5**], for hypercarbic
respiratory failure complicated by hypotension, often in the
setting of fever without definite source of infection.
.
Pt states that during the days leading up to admission she was
feeling weak and lethargic especially with exertion. On the
night prior to admission Pt noticed that she was becoming
"inflamed" or swollen from head to toe she denies erythema or
sob at that time, but she was feeling feverish. The next morning
Pt awoke with a headache and continued swelling and was brought
to the hospital by Pt's daughter. Pt denies lightheadedness,
change in vision, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations,
abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, pyuria, or
rhinorrhea/congestion.
.
Pt states that she has been using her BiPap every night and NC
O2 throughout the day. She denies medication non-compliance and
says that her daughter helps to administer her medications.

Brief Hospital Course:
53 year old female with obstructive sleep apnea,
obesity-hypoventilation syndrome, pulmonary hypertension with
ASD, and panhypopituitarism who presented with hypercarbic
respiratory failure.
.
In the [**Name (NI) **] Pt's VS were as follows: T 101 HR 86 BP 111/51 RR16
96%2L. She had a negative head CT, and an LP that was negative.
A UA was positive, and vancomycin and ceftriaxone were started.
CXR was negative for consolidation. An ABG showed hypercarbia
7.3/83/78. She became hypotensive to the 90's, but responded to
a NS bolus with subsequent systolic pressure of 105. She then
received Solumedrol 125mg and combivent nebs times three. A
repeat ABG was 7.25/90/108. She was admitted to the MICU for
BiPap.
.
In the MICU, a repeat VBG on BiPap revealed pH 7.24 with pCO2
91. Pt was fiberopticall
