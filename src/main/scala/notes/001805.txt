Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Lethargy, severe ulceration of pannus on right side

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Skin [**First Name3 (LF) **] debridement by plastic surgery service

History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname 803**] [**Known lastname 60400**] is a 55 year old morbidly obese woman who was
lost to medical care who was taken to [**Hospital3 **] ED when her
son called 911 due to concern over her recent decline in mental
status and mobility. Per son, she had been depressed the last
several months and then bedbound the last 3.5 weeks secondary to
fatigue. She had complained of chronic SOB but no other
localizing symptoms. Her son and sister tried to care for her
and encouraged her to go to ED but she refused secondary to
embarassment. Her son also [**Name2 (NI) 86727**] decreased PO intake the last
several days and confusion on day of admission. They gave her
two weeks to try ambulating on her own but when she remained
bedbound yesterday, called 911. After being removed from her
trailer, she was initially taken to [**Hospital3 **] and noted to
have necrotic pannus ulcers so was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
plastic surgery evaluation for debridement and possible skin
grafts. Prior to transfer, a triple lumen power PICC was placed
and she was given flagyl and unasyn.

In our ED, initial vs were: T 97.1 HR 102 BP 96/40 RR18 SaO2%96.
She was noted to drop her oxygen saturations with movement and
transport so was placed on NRB but sats later 95%RA. She was
seen by plastics and had wounds debrided which were noted to be
foul-smelling but did not appear infected. She was given
morphine 4mg IV x 3 and vancomycin 1g IV. She had an isolated
drop in BP 55/32 with morphine which responded to IVF. ABG drawn
for labs and reportedly mixed venous and arterial and blood cx
drawn. She received 4L NS. VS prior to transfer: 124/62 101 18
100%2L

On the floor, reports fatigue and not feeling well but denies
fevers, chills, N/V/D, abdominal pain, SOB, chest pain.

CXR [**2199-1-3**]:
IMPRESSION: Enlarged left pulmonary artery, of indeterminant
chronicity. If this is a new finding it could reflect recent
pulmonary emboli.No evidence of pneumonia. Findings were
discussed with Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] at the time of approval.

ECHO [**2199-1-4**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size
is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic
(EF 70-80%). The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied.
The right ventricular cavity is dilated with normal free wall
contractility. The aortic root is moderately dilated at the
sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened
(?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is zt least
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Dilated right ventricle;
moderate (or more) pulmonary hypertension

RUE U/S
IMPRESSION: Extensive right upper extremity deep venous thrombus
extending
from the right subclavian vein to the right axillary and the
duplicated
brachial veins. Occlusive thrombus within the right basilic
vein.

Bilateral LE U/S
IMPRESSION: Nondiagnostic examination of lower extremity veins
due to
patient's body habitus and discomfort during the exam. Normal
color flow
within the right common femoral vein.

Brief Hospital Course:
55 year old female with morbid obesity and hypertension admitted
to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with transient hypotension, lethargy and pressure ulcers
now s/p debridement by plastics. Patient transiently hypotensive
in ED after morphine but remainder of SBPs in 110s-120s so
likely related to morphine as well as significant component of
dehydration by labs and exam. After IVF boluses pt remained free
of hypotension for the remainder of stay. Pt ruled out for MI.

PROBLEM LIST:

# Severe ulcerations: See detailed assessment and
recommendations below.

# RUE DVT in the presence of power PICC line, removed on [**1-10**].
Bridged with heparin gtt until INR>2.  Coumadin 5mg given daily.
 [**1-13**] INR 2.6, [**1-14**] INR 4.9.  Coumadin held on [**2199-1-14**].
Recommend trending INR at LTAC and resuming Coumadin when
appropriate for a goal INR [**12-26**].

# Hypokalemia: KCl repleted orally, usually 40 mEq daily.

# Hypophosphatemia: Supplemental Neutrophos

# Vaginal candidiasis: Vaginal discharge noted on exam [**2199-1-14**]:
Patient without complaint for vaginal itching or discomfort.
Given one dose of fluconazole 200mg for candidiasis.

# Pulmonary HTN: seen on Echo, not previously known, pt may have
sleep apnea due to habitus but this has not yet been worked up.
Given that patient has a DVT as well, should consider PE if
condition worsens.
- Will need outpt follow-up sleep study
- Outpatient pulmonary hypertension workup.

# Depression, psychiatric, social situation:  psychiatry
consulted for pt's anxiety and depression, started on celexa
which has now been titrated to 20 mg daily.  SW for concern
