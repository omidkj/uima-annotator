ECHO:

LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Normal LV cavity size.
Mild-moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis. No resting
LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.
Paradoxic septal motion consistent with conduction
abnormality/ventricular pacing.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Normal
ascending aorta diameter. Normal aortic arch diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. No AS.
Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Moderate thickening of mitral valve chordae. Mild functional MS
due to MAC. Mild to moderate ([**1-30**]+) MR. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of MR may be significantly
UNDERestimated.]

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mildly thickened tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild
[1+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. There is mild to moderate global left ventricular
hypokinesis (LVEF = 35-40%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate thickening of the mitral
valve chordae. There is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean
gradient 3mmHg) due to mitral annular calcification. Mild to
moderate ([**1-30**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
# CAD/Ischemia: s/p stent placement in [**2187**]. EKG non-diagnostic
in setting of LBBB. troponin leak 0.13, CK, CK-MB negative on
first set. No intervention, per pt. preference anyway, though
this likely represents subendocardial ischemia from CHF
exacerbation.  CK-MBs low though troponins chronically positive,
partially [**3-1**] renal dz.  though to have a component of ischemia
[**3-1**] stretch from CHF exacerbation.
- asa, plavix loaded in ED. will continue asa 325 and restart
Plavix as she had [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in [**Month (only) **], unclear why patient off
plavix.
- on lopressor, unclear why not on [**Name (NI) **] consider adding as an
outpatient
- continue statin
- lipid panel, A1c show good lipid control, though HDL low
.
# Pump: likely combination of acute on chronic systolic and
diastolic congestive heart failure. Last EF 35-40%. BNP [**Numeric Identifier 15160**].
Unclear why having acute exacerbation, though may relate to
either poor BP control, Afib, infection.  h/o
