History of Present Illness:
53 year-old man with a possible history of hypertension presents
as a transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of intracranial
hemorrhage. The patient apparently presented to [**Hospital3 **]
late this morning with a left-sided headache associated with
dysarthria and right hemiparesis.  He reportedly had asked his
mother to call emergency services.  CBC revealed hyperchromia
and macrocytosis without anemia.  INR was reportedly normal
(thoough not included in transfer documentation).  EKG showed
sinus tachycardia perhaps with peaked T waves in V2 and V3.  CT
at [**Hospital1 **] revealed a pontine hemorrhage with spread into the 4th
ventricle.  There was one report that his left pupils was
"blown."  There was also report of a possible left lower lobe
opacity on CXR.  He was intubated for "airway protection" then
and received an additional dose of versed for some agitation on
the ventilator.  He also received 5 mg lopressor for blood
pressure control.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Pontine/medullary hemorrhage: The patient is a 53 year-old
man with a possible history of hypertension who presented as a
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] for management of intracranial hemorrhage. The
patient apparently presented to [**Hospital3 **] with a
left-sided headache followed by right hemiparesis. On general
examination on admission, he had a low-grade fever (rectal) and
was hypertensive.  On neurologic examination on admission, off
standing sedation, he was able to follow basic appendicular and
midline commands, nasal tickle and corneals were difficult to
elicit; otherwise brainstem reflexes, including pupillary
reflex, appeared preserved. He was not moving the right
voluntarily. CTA Head on admission showed hemorrhage in the
medulla and pons, subarachnoid hemorrhage in the prepontine and
premedullary cisterns, small amount of intraventricular
hemorrhage in the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the left lateral ventricle,
and slightly dilated lateral ventricles bilaterally. He received
Nimodipine for vasospasm x14 days starting on the day of
admission. Serum tox showed 78 EtOH, urine tox positive for BZD.
Neurosurgery was consulted on admission, and placed an [**Doctor Last Name 5041**] on
[**12-27**] in the right lateral ventricle. Given that the [**Month/Year (2) 5041**] was in
place, he was started on Dilantin 100 mg TID. Was later stopped
prior to transfer and had no seizures.  MRI head on admission
showed multiple small enhancing foci in the area of hemorrhage
in the left side of the pons; extensive left pontine and
medullary hemorrhage, intraventricular and subarachnoid
hemorrhage; moderate dilatation of the supratentorial
ventricular system; and small 1-2 mm infundibulum at the
junction of the right distal vertebral artery and the basilar
artery. Cerebral angiography was performed on [**1-3**], which
showed possible acute right vertebral artery occlusion, but no
AVM or aneurysm. Regardless, this occlusion would not explain
his symptoms and he could not be anticoagulated anyway. The
patient failed multiple attempts to clamp his [**Last Name (LF) 5041**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] a VP shunt
was placed.  Neurological course over the hospitalization was
stable to slowly improving.  He is alert and follows some
commands.  Near full strength extremities, and minimal movement
on right.  Also profound left facial weakness.

2. Hypertension: The patient has an unknown past medical
history, but possible history of hypertension. He was started on
Labetalol 200 PO tid and Lasix 20 mg daily. TTE showed no
cardiac source of embolism, hyperdynamic left ventricular
systolic function with LVEF >75%.

3. SIADH vs. cerebral salt wasting: His Na was 130 on admission,
then normal from [**Date range (1) 81836**]. However, on [**1-6**] his Na dropped
from 132->125, and nadired at 121. His serum osm was initially
262, and nadired at 256. Renal was consulted who determined that
he most likely had SIADH. He received 3% hypertonic saline at 20
cc/hr and initially started Lasix 20 PO bid to decrease urine
osms with improvement in his Na to normal.

4. ATN: His Cr increased from 0.8 to 1.4 on [**1-8**], and peaked at
1.7. Renal determined that this was possibly due to a
hypotensive episode along with his Hct drop (see below) causing
some ATN. FeNa was 2.3% supporting this. His Lasix and Enalapril
were discontinued at that time. Renal ultrasound was a limited
portable exam without hydronephrosis or upper abdominal ascites.
His Cr slowly improved.

5. ID: The patient continued to spike fevers during the
hospitalization, which were thought to be central fevers from
his hemorrhage. He was initially on Ancef IV while the [**Month/Day (4) 5041**] was
in place, then changed to Vanc/Cefazolin on [**1-4**] for WBC (40)
out of proportion to RBC (5250) in CSF, which was changed to
Vanc/Zosyn which was subsequently discontinued. CSF cultures
showed no growth, and eventually the WBC in his CSF was thought
to be reactive to the [**Month/Year (2) 5041**]. He also recevied Fluconazole 200 IV
q24 hr for sparse growth yeast in his sputum. Bilateral LENIs
showed no DVT of the lower extremities, and CT Torso showed
emphysematous changes in the lungs, minimal bronchiolitis in the
lingula and bilateral lower lobes, 1.4-cm enhancing lesion in
the left lobe of the liver may represent a hemangioma,
cholelithiasis. Head CT showed left mastoid opacification.

6. Respiratory: The patient was intubated upon admission, and
extubated [**12-28**] but then required re-intubation. Tracheostomy
was placed on [**1-4**].  Continues to be vented.

7. Hematology: He received 2 U PRBCs on [**1-8**] for a Hct drop to
23.7. His stool was guaiac negative.

8. Left corneal abrasion/ulceration: Ophthalomology was
consulted for his left eye chemosis, and the patient was found
to have a left corneal abrasion and ulceration. He is s/p
temporary tarsorrhaphy [**1-7**]. He was placed on
Bacitracin/Polymyxin ointment and artificial tears. Eye culture
showed no growth.  Impriving with ointment and drops.

9. GI/FEN: The pa
