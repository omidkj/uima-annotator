History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 y/o with h/o dm, HTN, CAD s/p PTCA distal LAD
([**2177-7-31**]) who prsents to the ED with chest pain, worsening
shortness of breath and substernal chest pain.
.
Per ED and Neurology notes who spoke to son, patient was at her
usual state of health until waking up this am. She noted chest
pain an dshortness of breath. Later on , her son noticed she was
having slureed speech.
Patient reports that over the last couple of weeks, she was
feeling with decrease energy and intermittent left sided
headaches. This morniing, she woke up with slurred speech and
strange sensation on the left side of her face.
She denied any any difficulty with word finding or speech
comprenhension, no limb weakness or gait instability.
She also reports chest pain about [**6-18**] that was all over her
chest and was going to both arms. No pleuritic. She thought she
was having another [**Doctor Last Name **] attacck. She did not take anything for
it.
She denief any fevers, nasusea, vomit, chills, cough, diarrhea,
abdominal pain associated.
.
She currently feels 2/10 chest pain, and feels that her speech
is not back to baseline. She is oriented and coherent on her
speech.
.
In The ED vs: T 97, HR 68, BP 78-88; 92/37 RR 20on 2L NC. Code
stroke was initially called but cancelled given that her
presentation was more consistent with encephalopatic process.
she was also bradycardic to the 40's with low BP. She was given
glucagon 5 mg IV x1. She was also given Dextrose 50%, and
combivent nebs. 1.5 L of NS were given.

[**9-8**] CT head w/o contrast:
IMPRESSION: No mass effect or hemorrhage
.
[**9-8**] CXR
FINDINGS: Portable AP upright chest radiograph reviewed. The
lung volumes are low. There is diffuse opacification of both
lungs with more dense bilateral retrocardiac opacities. The hila
are hazy and the pulmonary vasculature are engorged. The left
costophrenic angle is not sharp and a small left pleural
effusion on this poor quality radiograph cannot be excluded.

IMPRESSION: Moderate CHF.
.
[**9-9**] Renal U/S no hydronephrosis
.
[**9-9**] CT C/T/L spine without contrast
FINDINGS: The study is severely limited due to patient body
habitus and a mild amount of motion artifact. Cord compression
cannot be excluded based on non-contrast study. Within the
limitations of the artifact, there are no large displaced
fractures. There is a large amount of degenerative change. At
C2-3, [**4-12**], there is no spinal canal stenosis.

At C5-6, there is a small posterior osteophyte with mild spinal
canal stenosis. There is a large osteophyte at the right side of
the vertebral body. C5-6, there is a moderate sized posterior
osteophyte which appears to cause at least a moderate spinal
canal narrowing. There are osteophytes at both uncovertebral
joints.

At C6-7, there is a small posterior osteophyte present. This
causes no significant canal narrowing.

As the patient's body habitus produces significant artifact
within the spinal canal, a disc or rather soft tissue masses
could easily cause spinal cord compression would not be
visualized on this study. An alternative way to evaluate the
central canal would be to obtain a CT myelogram.

IMPRESSION: Spinal cord compression cannot be excluded based on
a non- contrast CT with this amount of artifact. Multilevel
degenerative changes and osteophytes causing at least moderate
spinal canal narrowing at C5-6.
.
[**9-11**] Myelogram: IMPRESSION: Successful fluorographically guided
myelogram via the lumbar puncture at L3. No evidence of
significant central canal stenosis. For further detailed
findings, please refer to the CT myelogram of the same day.




Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 71 y/o female with HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, CAD, OSA,
Asthma
with slurred speech and LE weakness
.
#) Slurred speech, LE weakness. Still unclear etiology. Per
patient, this was resolving by the date of discharge.  Had
negative CT scan of head. CT of spine showed spinal canal
narrowing at cervical, thoracic, and lumbar levels. CT after
myelograms shows severe stenosis at the thoracic level. Patient
refused the possiblity of neurosurgery.
.
#) CAD: CE neg X 2. No additional chest pain complaints once
transferred to the floor.
- Continued ASA, plavix, metoprolol, atorvastatin, added back
ACEI on last day (had been held secondary to ARF)
.
#) Bradycardia with escape rhythm: Resolved. Thought to be due
to BB overdose in the setting of renal failure. Now in sinus.
- monitored on Telemetry without events
- continued on low dose beta blocker
.
#) Wheezing: still unclear whether pulm edema or asthma or an
element of both. LVEF >55%.
- continued alb and ip nebs
.
#) OSA: continued on BiPAP.
.
#) ARF: Likley pre renal secondary to lasix as improved with
hydration. Renal u/s negative for hydronephrosis
- Cr 1.0 at discharge
- discharged on [**2-10**] dose of Lasix that she was taking on
admission: 40 mg po qd
.
#) DM: Continued on glyburide. Insulin sliding scale. Blood
sugars well-controlled on floor.
.
#) Microcytic Anemia: needs outpatient colonoscopy
.
#) FEN: Diabetic/Caradiac Diet
.
#) PPX: Heparin SC
