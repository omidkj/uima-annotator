[**2195-2-19**] AP CXR:
 AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient
sitting
upright position. Comparison is made with the next previous
available chest
examination of [**2194-10-23**]. The patient has recently
undergone
implantation of a left-sided permanent pacer seen in anterior
axillary
position. The pacer is connected to a dual electrode system. One
of these is
terminating in a position compatible with the right atrial
appendage. The
second with two electrode enforcements representing the ICD
terminates in a
position compatible with the apical portion of the right
ventricle. Heart
size is unchanged and remains within normal limits. No pulmonary
congestion
is seen and no pneumothorax can be identified.
.
[**2195-2-17**] ECG: Normal sinus rhythm. Intraventricular conduction
delay with left bundle-branch block pattern and QRS duration of
140 milliseconds. Leftward axis at minus 50 degrees. Compared to
the previous tracing of [**2195-1-25**] no diagnostic interim change.
.
[**2195-2-18**] ECG: Sinus bradycardia with sinus arrhythmia. P-R
interval prolongation. Left axis deviation. Probable inferior
myocardial infarction of indeterminate age. ST-T wave changes
that are non-specific. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2195-2-18**] multiple described abnormalities persist. QTc 466

Brief Hospital Course:
62 y/o M with dilated cardiomyopathy admitted for initiation of
dofetilide, complicated by torsades, no s/p pacer/ICD placement.

.
# RHYTHM: He was admitted for inpatient monitoring during the
initiation of dofetilide. He was initiated on dofetilide 500mcg
Q12hours with EKG 2 hours after each dose, and magnesium oxide
400mg twice daily.  Patient had torsades the morning of [**2-19**] in
the setting of a prolonged QT interval and worsening
bradycardia.  He was emergently cardioverted, but the rhythm
recurred two more times.  He was given IV magnesium sulfate, and
taken for pacer/ICD placement.  The insertion of the pacer was
without incident and he was kept overnight in the CCU.  No
further dofetilide was given and it should simply wash out of
his system.  He is now paced at 80bpm and had no further
arrhythmias on telemetry.  Given his history of MRSA and
penicillin allergy, he got one day of vancomycin and two days of
clindamycin for prophylaxis after pacer placement.  He was
discharged back on all of his home medications, including
warfarin with a goal INR of [**2-4**].
.
# PUMP: He has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy (EF15%), but
appeared euvolemic throughout his stay. He was continued on his
home doses of lasix, aldactone, lisinopril.  The atenolol was
held in the setting of bradycardia, but restarted once he was
being paced.
