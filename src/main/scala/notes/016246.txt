Darunavir-rit-truvada, CAD, HTN, hyperlipidemia, diverticulitis,
urethral stenosis with multiple UTIs, who presented to the ED
with fever. He reported that 3 days prior to presentation, he
began to notice cough which had become more productive. His
sputum had mostly slightly whitish and small volume, but in the
ED he had thicker sputum which was sent for culture.  Aside from

had 4 attempts at lumbar puncture none of which were successful.
 He received ceftriaxone, azithromycin, dapsone.  A CXR was
without infiltrates or edema.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Positive per HPI.  All other systems reviewed and negative.

Past Medical History:
1. HIV: He was diagnosed in [**2080**] after a sexual partner had
misrepresented his status to him. He has had no opportunistic
infections since diagnosis, and his lowest CD4 count was last
year (118 in [**2102-8-17**]). He was hospitalized for pneumonia in
[**2081**] that was presumed to be PCP pneumonia and is currently not
on PCP prophylaxis as his CD4 >200.
2. Diverticulitis: Was hospitalized for diverticulitis
(presented with fever & LLQ abdominal pain) in [**2098-4-16**] which
was L-sided and treated with Cipro/Flagyl - no
abscess/perforation. Since then, he has had sporadic LLQ
abdominal pain and has been treated outpatient for presumed
diverticulitis. Was also hospitalized in [**2102-4-17**] for
diverticulitis (again no abscess, no perforation) and treated
with Cipro/Flagyl. Takes Metamucil regularly.
3. CAD: He experienced angina 12 years ago, has never had an MI
or any revascularization procedures. He was found to have
moderate partially reversible perfusion defect in the inferior
and inferoseptal myocardium on [**9-/2102**] exercise MIBI. He
initially was started on nitroglycerin but had headaches and is
now on isosorbide dinitrate.
4. Hypertension: Difficult to control, is currently on 4 agents
for BP control.
5. Past infection with Hepatitis B ([**2071**]) - was hospitalized for
acute treatment and has not had any issues since. HBsAb & HBsAg
negative in [**8-/2102**], HBcAb positive.
6. Past infection with syphilis in [**2081**]
7. Multiple UTIs due to urethral stenosis (Last urethral
dilation in [**8-/2102**], urethrotomy in 04/[**2099**]).

9. Hyperlipidemia
10. Multiple ear infections (R>L) and ?perforation of eardrum

CXR [**2104-6-22**]:
IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of acute cardiopulmonary
process.

CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST [**2104-6-22**]:
IMPRESSION: no acute process

CTA CHEST [**6-23**]:
1. No evidence for PE.
2. Small lung nodules in a tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] configuration in the
lower lobes
bilaterally consistent with small airways disease are concerning
for
aspiration. Differetial diagnosis would include other infectious
or
inflammatory process.

The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or
patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline
contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
