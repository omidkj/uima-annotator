Chief Complaint:
R putaminal hemorrhage

Endotracheal Intubation
Tracheostomy

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 59501**] is a 53 year old male with history of
nephrolithiasis
and ? pyelonephritis who presents with large R putaminal
hemorrhage. The patient complained of feeling warm earlier
today,
and mild low back pain consistent with his history of kidney
for percocet for the pain. The patient had entertained guests in
his home this evening and was feeling well. He developed low
back
pain in the evening, took a percocet for the pain, went to his
prayer room, and he was then found by his wife on the floor,
vomiting and unable to get up. He was able to speak to her and
asked that he be put in bed. He never complained of having any
headache. His wife called EMS. The patient was intubated for
airway protection en route to the OSH by EMS.

At the [**Hospital3 20284**] Center the pt's head CT revealed a large
right putaminal hemorrhage extending posteriorly and inferiorly
in the right posterior midbrain with blood in the third
ventricle. The patient was given phosphenytoin 1500mg, Ativan
2mg, Pancuronium, zofran and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
care.

At present the pt is unable to provide a ROS. His wife reports
recent low back pain and perhaps fevers, but he did not take his
temperature at home. Otherwise he has been feeling well recently
without N/V/D. No recent wt loss. He does not have a history of
headaches.

Social History:
Married, has two children, he works as a laotian translator
at [**Hospital3 1810**] and also formerly at [**Hospital1 18**], he has also
worked as a court transcriptionist. He smoked for many years,
quit 2 years ago. He does not drink any alcohol. Wife reports
that he has never used any illicit or IV drugs.


Family History:
pt's wife is unfamiliar with his FH, does not recall any h/o
stroke, ICH or bleeding diasthesis.

to withdraw with the RUE purposefully to noxious stimulation.
Extensor posturing of LUE and LLE with noxious stimulation.
Withdraws right leg to noxious.

Sensation- intact to noxious throughout. Pt flexes R arm to
noxious on left leg, but is unable to localize to sternal rub.

Reflexes- 2+ on R [**Hospital1 **], tri, brachioradialis and patellar, ankle.
On the left there are 3+ reflexes in the [**Hospital1 **], tri,
brachioradialis. The left patellar reflex spreads to the left
leg
inducing clonus- 4+.

Imaging:
Head CT [**2121-4-4**]:
FINDINGS: There is acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the
right basal
ganglia measuring roughly 4 x 3 cm, which extends inferiorly
into the right pons and mid brain. There is a moderate amount of
associated intraventricular blood seen within the lateral
ventricles, greater on the right than on the left. Small amount
of blood is seen within the third ventricle. There is slight
effacement of the suprasellar cistern, suggesting early uncal
herniation. There is minimal, 2 mm leftward subfalcine
herniation. Edema surrounding the area of hemorrhage causes mild
mass effect on adjacent sulci.
There is no extra-axial hemorrhage. There is no evidence of
infarction. There is no fracture.
IMPRESSION: Acute intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right basal
ganglia,
with extension into the right pons and mid brain. Moderate
intraventricular extension into the lateral ventricles and third
ventricle. Early uncal herniation.
NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: Although I agree with most of
the above
report, there is no evidence of uncal herniation associated with
this globus pallidus hematoma.
<br>
Head CT [**2121-4-5**]:
NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: Since prior examination, there has been no
significant change in the hemorrhage within the right globus
pallidus extending into the midbrain. Although there is less
blood in the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral ventricles, the extent
of hemorrhage within the posterior [**Doctor Last Name 534**] of the lateral
ventricles, third ventricle, and fourth ventricle is not
appreciably changed. No new hemorrhage is identified. This is
associated with mildly increased hydrocephalus. A 5 mm vague
hyperdensity is seen within the inferior brainstem (series 2,
image 4), which was retrospectively present on prior exam and
may represent tiny focus of blood. Copious secretions are seen
within the nasopharynx. The visualized paranasal sinuses and
mastoid air cells remain normally aerated.
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable hemorrhage within the right globus pallidus extending
into the mid brain.
2. Minimally increased hydrocephalus.
<br>
CXR [**2121-4-4**]:
FINDINGS: Single portable supine chest radiograph is reviewed
without
comparison. Endotracheal tube is in place, just below the
thoracic inlet, 5.4 cm above the carina. Tube could be advanced
for more optimal positioning. Cardiomediastinal contours are
within normal limits allowing for portable supine technique. The
lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
IMPRESSION: Endotracheal tube tip seen just below the thoracic
inlet, 5.4 cm above the carina.
<br>
CXR [**2121-4-6**]:
SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST: The nasogastric tube has been
removed and Dobbhoff tube placed with tip terminating in similar
location within the proximal stomach. An endotracheal tube tip
terminates 3 cm from the carina. The cardiomediastinal
silhouette is stable and unremarkable. The lungs are clear.
There is no effusion.
IMPRESSION: Standard Dobbhoff tube tip placement terminating
over proximal
stomach.
<br>
KUB [**2121-4-9**]:
IMPRESSION: No evidence of ileus or obstruction
<br>

CT TORSO [**2121-4-14**]:
FINDINGS: The lung volumes are low. The patient is status post
tracheostomy. The airways are patent to the subsubsegmental
level. The heart and great vessels are unremarkable. There are
no pulmonary nodules. There is no mediastinal or axillary
adenopathy. There are bilateral moderate, pleural effusions with
adjacent atelectasis.
CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is massive ascites. The right
lobe of the liver is borderline small. The caudate lobe is
somewhat prominent, as is the left lobe, consistent with
cirrhosis. There is a hypoattenuating liver mass measuring 4.7 x
3.1 cm, in segment IV A of the liver, which encroaches on the
IVC and the portal vein. There are other smaller liver lesions,
which are too small to characterize. The gallbladder, pancreas,
spleen, adrenals are normal. There is a cyst in the upper pole
of the left kidney. The bowel shows generalized edema likely due
to the patient's cirrhosis. The SMA, SMV, celiac artery, and [**Female First Name (un) 899**]
are all opacified. There is no evidence of bowel obstruction or
ischemia. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy.
