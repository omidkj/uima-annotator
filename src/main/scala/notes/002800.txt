History of Present Illness:
59 yo man with previous hx of EtOH abuse and likely
long-standing cirrhosis, presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital earlier
today with epigastric pain followed by bloody emesis x3. Patient
went kayaking on the morning of admission and began to feel
lightheaded and nauseous, he pulled ashore and lost
consciousness (unwitnessed); denies head injury. He awoke and
was noted to have blood around his mouth by his brother. [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name2 (NI) 35261**] developed epigastric pain and bloody emesis x3, then
presented to OSH. Initial hct done at 3pm at [**Hospital1 **] was 36,
this trended down to hct of 25 at 9pm; during this time he
received no blood and possibly 2L crystalloid. EGD at [**Hospital1 **]
showed esophageal varices and erosions (location unknown), no
active bleeding seen. There was no intervention; indication for
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] per OSH report was TIPS procedure (unclear
why). 4 U FFP were given prior to transfer and 1 U pRBC hung in
route to [**Hospital1 18**].
.
As pt does not not typically follow at [**Hospital1 **], little
information regarding his PMH was available at the time of
transfer. By his account, he has carried the diagnosis of
cirrhosis for ~30yrs and has recently been followed by Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 82939**] at [**Hospital 5871**] Hospital. 2 weeks ago he started taking
nadolol which he stopped several days ago. He is also
non-compliant with Prilosec. He claims to currently drink 2
glasses of wine twice per week, but his girlfriend suspects that
he consumes at least that much daily and possibly more. She
states that he had been sober for a decade and resumed drinking
w/in the last 3 years. Consumption increased after a reportedly
improved EGD w/in the last month. He has no hx of withdrawal. He
denies hx of previous UGIB or melena.
.
In the ED, initial vital signs were: T=98.9, P=106, BP=112/62,
R=22, O2sat=98% 3LNC. Patient was given 800cc NS and started on
octreotide drip prior to arrival to MICU. He was noted to have
several melanotic stools (at least 3) while in the [**Hospital1 18**] ED with
no further emesis. NG lavage cleared after 500cc. Per ED
signout, he may have aspirated in the setting of having bloody
emesis; both pt and girlfriend deny any recollection of this.
Total resuscitation at the time of arrival was 3.4L including 1u
pRBC and 4 UFFP.
.
In the ICU yesterday, patient underwent upper endoscopy that
showed 3 bands of grade II esophageal varices (all were banded)
in addition to portal hypertensive gastropathy. Post-procedure
he was continued on octreotide drip and ciprofloxacin per liver
service recommendations. His hematocrit remained stable in the
25-27 range without any further transfusions. His BP and HR were
stable 110-130s/50-60s and 50-60s respectively, and there were
no further episodes of bleeding. He continued to have dark
melanotic stools.
.
Speaking with him at time of transfer, he says he feels much
better. There is no nausea, no abdominal pain, no
lightheadedness or dizziness. His last drink, he says, was
Saturday afternoon at 1PM.

Social History:
Alcohol abuse until the present although to a lesser degree than
previously. Denied smoking. Denied illicit drugs. He says that
10+ years ago, he used to drink 6-7 beers/day in addition to [**2-3**]

URINE CX ([**2108-8-22**]) negative

EKG ([**2108-8-19**]): NSR, rate 88

CXR ([**2108-8-19**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intrathoracic process.

ABDOMINAL U/S w/ DOPPLERS: IMPRESSION:
1. Coarsened hepatic architecture with no liver lesion
identified and no
biliary dilatation.
2. Cholelithiasis with no sign of cholecystitis.
3. Splenomegaly.
4. Patent hepatic vasculature.
5. Right pleural effusion.
6. Trace of ascites in the perihepatic space.

CXR ([**2108-8-20**]) FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph,
there is an unchanged retrocardiac opacity. Its appearance,
however, suggests atelectasis rather than pneumonia. Mild
bilateral pleural effusions. Increased perihilar vascular
diameters indicate moderate overhydration. Otherwise, no
relevant changes.

TTE ([**2108-8-21**]): The left atrium is moderately dilated. The
estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity is mildly dilated. Regional left ventricular wall motion
is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at
rest or with Valsalva. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Mild left ventricular cavity dilation. Mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and
regional biventricular systolic function. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation.

CXR ([**2108-8-22**]): The heart size is mildly enlarged, stable. The
