History of Present Illness:
[**Known firstname **] is a 17 yo right handed girl with childhood onset
relapsing MS referred here for urgent LP per IR from Dr. [**Name (NI) 58349**] clinic for positional but persistent HA without visual
disturbance concerning for increased ICP from infectious process
or pseudotumor cerebri.
.
Per records, given that patient refused to give hx, patient
reported persistent, positional HA to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**] on [**10-10**] that
interfered with sleep.  She denied any nausea/vomiting or visual
disturbance and was still on prednisone taper 10mg daily.  The
steroids were stopped per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**] on [**10-10**] then patient appears
to have presented to [**Hospital1 **] on [**10-12**] with 2 seizures (R arm
extension then head thrown back with followed by generalized
convulsion for ~ 1 minute) with EEG showing mainly L sided
discharges.  Because she refused to be admitted, patient was
started on Dilantin then discharged with prescription which was
promptly thrown away per Mom.  Open MRI at outside facility was
arranged per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10208**] but patient aborted the study in 5
minutes due to anxiety.  With some police and legal assistance,
patient was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] and had MRI under sedation on
[**10-17**] which showed a new T2/FLAIR lesion in the R superior-lateral
pons near trigeminal root entry and also question of enhancement
of left meninges. Although ID was consulted, patient was
clinically stable, hence further work-up was deferred and
patient was discharged with Keppra to be increased from 500 to
1000mg at bedtime in 1 week.
.
Given the hx of questions meningeal enhancement and persistent
positional headache in a patient with recent high dose steroids,
infectious process was suspected hence Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8760**] recommended
urgent LP under IR to rule out increased ICP and CNS infection.
.
As for her prior demyelinating disorder, patient developed
bilateral leg weakness followed by R eye vision loss after 2
weeks of URI symptoms and high fever back in [**5-13**].  Upon
admission to [**Hospital1 **], she was diagnosed with ADEM and treated
with IVMP for 5 days.  She improved significantly but was
readmitted on [**6-12**] after recurrence of vision loss in R eye and
repeat imaging showed new lesions hence had another 5 day course
of IVMP.  Then in [**7-13**], she presented with vague visual
complaints and found to have LUQ field cut and MRI showing
lesions in bilateral occipital lobes with brainstem lesions
hence received another 5 days of IVMP.  In [**9-12**], she was
readmitted for vision loss and APD that recovered with another
course of IVMP.  Then in [**7-18**], patient again had decreased
vision with pain in R eye hence received 3 days of IVMP with
oral steroid taper.  She was also treated with Avonex from [**9-12**]
through [**2-16**] as weekly injections but discontinued due to
depression.
.
She had earlier been evaluated at [**Hospital3 14659**] as well where Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 58350**] believed that she has an NMO spectrum disorder
although Ab negative with absent myelopathy and good visual
recovery.  He also advised considering prolonged steroid
treatment of 9 months co-administered with either CellCept or
Imuran.
.
Patient on admission was very upset that she had been told to
lay flat for 1 hr after LP hence would like to be discharged.
However, upon reassuring that she will be moved to a more
comfortable bed soon and that she needs treatment until
infections has been rule out, she was willing to stay, although
she was only semi-cooperative with the exam.
