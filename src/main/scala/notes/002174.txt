Chief Complaint:
SOB

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation

History of Present Illness:
This is a 41-year-old woman with a past medical history
significant for obesity hypoventilation, apparent reactive
airway disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presented to
the ED with shortness of breath and chest tightness since last
night.  According to the ED, this was worsening throughout the
day today, so patient called EMS.  On EMS arrival, she was
tachypneic and placed on a nonrebreather.

On arrival to the ED, initial vitals were 98.5 105 170/120 20
100% on NRB.  She was given duonebs x 2, 125 IV solumedrol.
Initial VBG showed 7.32/67/76.  She was trialed on BiPAP,
however, became increasingly somnolent, snoring, dropping O2
sats to 70s/80, so was intubated.  Per the ED resident, the
intubation was difficult requiring three attempts, placed [**8-2**]
tube.  After the intubation, there was blood suctioned from the
ETT that cleared with a minilavage by respiratory.  On transfer,
her vent settings were CMV Fi02 100 5 PEEP, TV 450 on propofol
50, vitals 99 114/51 100%. A RIJ was placed in the ED.  CTA done
to r/o PE was performed prior to transfer to the ICU.

Of note, she was recently discharged on [**6-17**] for hypercarbic
respiratory failure and reactive airway disease, recovered with
BiPAP, nebulizers, steroids, and azithromycin.  She was also
given a dose of 20 IV lasix, even though she has no history of
heart failure. Patient was supposed to have outpatient sleep
study and pulmonary evaluation.

Past Medical History:

CTA [**2103-7-19**]:

TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the
chest without
intravenous contrast.  Subsequently, images were obtained
through the chest
and arterial phase after the uneventful administration of 100 cc
of omnipaque
contrast media.  Multiplanar reformations were prepared.

FINDINGS:  The pulmonary arterial tree is well opacified without
evidence of
embolism.  The aorta and major branches are normal in caliber
and patent, with
note made of a bovine aortic arch.  Heart and pericardium are
normal without
pericardial effusion.  The esophagus is normal.  Nasogastric
tube curled to
the stomach.  There is no axillary, mediastinal, hilar, or
pathologic
adenopathy, though nonenlarged mediastinal nodes up to 9 mm and
left hilar
node up to 8 mm are noted.  The trachea and central airways are
patent to
segmental level with endotracheal tube terminating appropriately
in the mid
trachea.  Right greater than left moderate bibasilar atelectasis
is seen, with
otherwise well aerated lungs.  There is at most trace pleural
effusion.
Imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is no lytic or sclerotic bony lesion
to suggest
osseous malignancy.

IMPRESSION:  No acute aortic syndrome or pulmonary embolus.
Moderate right
greater than left basal atelectasis.
.
ECHO [**2103-7-20**]:
Poor image quality. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to
suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There is no ventricular
septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and
no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation.
The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
There is no pericardial effusion.
.
CXR [**2103-7-22**]:
FINDINGS:  The ET tube has been removed.  Right IJ line tip is
in the right
atrium.  The right hemidiaphragm is mildly elevated and there
are slightly low
lung volumes.  There is pulmonary vascular redistribution and
perihilar haze.
There is dense retrocardiac opacity, consistent with volume
loss/infiltrate/effusion.  Compared to the prior study, the lung
volumes are
lower and pulmonary edema slightly worse.  An underlying
infectious infiltrate
cannot be excluded.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 41-year-old woman with a past medical history
significant for reactive airway disease, obesity hypoventilation
syndrome, likely OSA who presents with acute respiratory
failure.

# RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Patient has components of obstructive
and reactive airway disease and obesity hypoventilation
syndrome.  She has had admissions for respiratory failure in the
past and unfortunately has not had recent PFTs or a sleep study.
 It is even possible that initially, BIPAP worsened patient's
respiratory failure, decreasing her PC02 and in turn her
respiratory drive.  She was intubated in the ED and admitted to
the MICU.  Patient subsequently self-extubated on [**7-21**] and did
well on 2-3L of NC.  She was diuresed in the MICU, though never
clear evidence that she was in heart failure.  Also started on
antibiotics for PNA, but these were stopped once sputum culture
was negative.  Patient continued to improve from a respiratory
standpoint and she
