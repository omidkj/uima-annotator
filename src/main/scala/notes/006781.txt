HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 77-year-old
woman with a history of prior cerebrovascular accident in
[**2163-10-22**] and atrial fibrillation in [**2165-6-21**]
(on Plavix and Coumadin) who was in her usual state of health
until yesterday evening on the day prior to admission when
she began experiencing a sensation of abdominal discomfort

Coumadin, atenolol, Lipitor, Aricept, Atrovent, Tylenol,
quinine, albuterol, and Plavix.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Social history was negative for tobacco now
with a previous 40-pack-year history.  No alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed the patient's temperature was 98.1
degrees Fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 130/59, her heart
rate was 66, her respiratory rate was 22, and her oxygen
saturation was 97% on room air.  In general, the patient was
resting, in no acute distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and
throat examination revealed the neck was supple.  No masses.
No jugular venous distention.  No bruits.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  Positive first heart sound and second
heart sound.  Respiratory examination revealed the lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended, and obese.  Multiple scars.
Positive bowel sounds.  Extremity examination revealed
capillary refill was about two seconds.  No edema.  Rectal
examination was guaiac-positive.  Neurologic examination
revealed the patient was awake, alert and oriented times
three.  Good affect.  Cranial nerves II through XII were
intact.  The skin was warm, dry, and pink.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
on admission revealed the patient's white blood cell count
was 11.3, her hematocrit was 30.3, and her platelets were
306.  Chemistry-7 was notable for a blood urea nitrogen of
66.  Her INR was notable for a level of 3.3.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram revealed a
normal sinus rhythm but poor R wave progression.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted
for an upper gastrointestinal bleed which did not respond to
nasogastric lavage.

The patient had an emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy done
which showed an ulceration in the stomach which was injected
with epinephrine.  Also evident was old blood seen in the
body of the stomach.  Otherwise, a normal
esophagogastroduodenoscopy to the third part of the duodenum.

The patient had a Helicobacter pylori assay which was
negative and was continued on twice per day proton pump
inhibitors for her upper gastrointestinal bleed.  The patient
had serial hematocrit levels checked which stabilized at
around 30.  The patient had received a total of 3 units of
packed red blood cells.

Otherwise, the patient's gastrointestinal bleed stabilized,
and on the day of discharge the patient no longer had
melanotic stools.  The patient was to have a repeat endoscopy
on [**2165-10-23**] to make sure her ulceration had healed.

Otherwise, the patient improved in terms of her
gastrointestinal bleed.  The patient's Plavix and Coumadin
were held initially; however, the patient was discharged on
Coumadin after recommendations from Cardiology on the risks
and benefits and decided the risk of stroke required the
restarting of Coumadin.  Plavix was still held and was to be
re-evaluated by her neurologist as an outpatient.

On [**9-14**], the patient was noted to go into rapid atrial
fibrillation with a rate of 180s which eventually responded
to diltiazem boluses and a diltiazem drip.  The patient
converted spontaneously into a sinus rhythm and remained in a
sinus rhythm over the next 48 hours prior to discharge.  The
patient had another set of serial cardiac enzymes to rule out
a myocardial infarction.  The patient was stable, and those
remained negative.  The patient was also started on
amiodarone.  She was loaded initially at 400 mg twice per day
for one week and was then to continue on 200 mg by mouth
twice per day for rhythm control.  The patient was continued
on her atenolol 50 mg by mouth once per day for rate control.
The patient was also restarted on her Coumadin with a goal
INR of 2.0 to 3.0.  Otherwise, the patient's atrial fibrillation
remained stable, and the patient was to follow up with Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in the next few weeks.

For hypertension, the patient's hypertension remained stable
on her regimen of atenolol.  The patient's dementia was
stable on her Aricept.  The patient's leg cramps were stable
on her quinine.  The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease was stable on her albuterol and Atrovent meter-dosed
inhalers.  The patient's hypercholesterolemia was stable with
Lipitor.

The patient was ambulating without difficulty; not on oxygen.
Currently doing well and without melanotic stools and a
normal sinus rhythm.
