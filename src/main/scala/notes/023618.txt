Allergies:
Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6195**]
Chief Complaint:
altered MS x 24hr

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
83 yo female w/ PMHX sig for HTN, CHF w/ diastolic dysfunction,
right renal artery stenosis p/w increased lethargy and
unresponsiveness for 1 day.  Her son states that she has not had
any consitutional symptoms in the last several weeks.  She
denies fevers/chills/myalgias/N/V/CP/SOB/Abd pain.  The son
indicates that his mother recently started a oxaprazin (NSAID)
in the last week for lower back pain.  She has been taking the
medication twice a day.  She was in her ususal states of health
prior to the last 24 hours.  Currently she is in bed and has
decreased response to verbal commands.

Upon arrival to the ED the patient initially had a HR in the
40's with a BP of 120/58 and an EKG showing atrial fibrillation
and a creatinine of 4.4 w/ a last measured creatinine of 1.7 in
[**7-26**].  Her SBP subsequently dropped to the 80's but responded to
glucagon, atropine, and calcium gluconate.  However, the
response was transient  and she again began to drop her pressure
requiring additional 2 additional doses of medications.  She was
transferred to the MICU for monitoring of her hemodynamic
instability.

Past Medical History:
1. Hypertension with a negative
cardiac catheterization in [**2175**] and a negative stress test in
[**2180**], echocardiogram in [**2186-4-22**] showing an EF of greater
then 55% and mild left ventricular hypertrophy, stress MIBI [**2185**]
negative.
2. Questionable congestive heart failure secondary to diastolic
dysfunction.
3. Chronic dyspnea on exertion with a baseline O2 sat of the low
90s.
4. Nephrolithiasis.
5.Dyskinesias.
6. Atrial septal defect with a left to rightshunt.
7. Low back pain - spinmal disk disease
8. macular degeneration
9. pulmonary HTN moderate by echo
10. R short segment renal artery stenosis
11. left kidney cyst
12. diverticulosis


Social History:
She lives at home with her husband.  She quit smoking 30 years
earlier.  Rare ETOH use

Family History:
non-contributory

Physical Exam:
Vitals - Temp 97.9 BP 150/80 P 57 RR 18 97% 1.5L
.
Gen - lying in bed, NAD.
HEENT - mildly dry mm, EOMI
CV: RRR S1/S2, no m/r/g
Lungs: bibasilar crackles
Abd: soft NT, ND, + BS
Ext: no c/c/e
Neuro: A&O x3

Pertinent Results:
CT head - Study limited by motion, but no intracranial
hemorrhage or mass effect is seen. If clinically indicated and
patient can tolerate, an MR is more sensitive to detect acute
ischemia.
.
CXR - The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. There is
respiratory motion. No definite infiltrates, but there are low
lung volumes. No pulmonary edema.
.
ECG - Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
Right bundle-branch
block and left axis deviation. Poissible prior inferior
myocardial infarction.
Non-specific ST-T wave changes. Compared to the previous tracing
of [**2188-12-8**]
the ventricular response to atrial fibrillation is faster.
Clinical correlation
is suggested.

Brief Hospital Course:
83 yo female w/ hx CAD, diastolic CHF, pulm HTN, RA stenosis,
dyskinesia p/w new ARF, bradycardia, hypotension and MS changes
secondary to beta-blocker/calcium channel blocker toxicity.
.
Hypotension - This was most likely [**12-24**] BB/CCB toxicity in the
setting of recently starting NSAIDs, renal artery stenosis, and
decreased po intake contributing to ARF.  Toxicology was
initially consulted in the ED.  Per their recommendations
patient was given atropine, glucagon, and calcium salt infusions
for her blood pressures.  The patient was transferred to the
MICU on a glucagon and insulin drip.  Nephrology consultation
recommended volume replacement for treatment of pre-renal
azotemia.   The patient was also written for phosphate binders
in the setting of acute renal failure.  The patient was
maintained on D5W @ 70cc/hr.  An arterial line was placed for
tight BP monitoring.  Her BP stabilized in the MICU and she was
transferred to the floor on [**12-7**].
.
ARF - likely secondary to her NSAIDs along w/ her ACE-i and
renal artery stenosis. She also likely had a prerenal component,
though her FeNa was ~ 7% suggesting intrarenal disease -- she
may have progressed to ATN (though muddy brown casts absent in
sediment).  Her blood pressure medications and diuretics were
held.  After fluid hydration her creatinine trended down and on
the floor returned to 1.7.
.
MS changes - pt likely had poor cerebral perfusion secondary to
hypotension and bradycardia, she may have had an additional
component of uremia. She was given ativan in the ED and had a
prolonged period of sedation but eventually became more lucid
when her metabolic abnormalities were corrected.
.
Afib - The patient was continuously in and out of atrial
fibrillation during the hospitalization.  She had a documented
episode of atrial fibrillation from a previous hospitalization.
She also had a TTE from one year prior that showed a dilated
left atrium.  The patient had a TSH level that was normal.  It
was thought that she likely had PAF that was long standing.  She
had two episodes of rapid atrial fibrillation resulting in flash
pulmonary edema that responded to lasix and po lopressor.  Once
her creatinine stabilized, the patient was given her outpatient
dose of metoprolol and half her diltiazem dose with good rate
control.  Per the attending, anticoagulation was held as the
patient was deemed to be a large fall risk.  Her anticoagulation
would be redressed when her functional status was better
elucidated.
.
CAD - the patient was continued on her aspirin and lipitor
.
HTN - The patient documented SBP in the 200's as an outpatient.
Upon transfer to the floor her BP slowly began to trend up.  Her
BP medications were added slowly in light of her presenting
episode.  Her last measured BP was 150/84.  Upon d/c she was
taking
