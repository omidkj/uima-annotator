HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 74-year-old
man, with a long history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and a former smoking history.  In the Fall of [**2113**],
he developed evidence of pneumonia in the right upper lobe,
treated with antibiotics.  His symptoms resolved, but the
lesion in the right upper lobe persisted.  CT scans suggested
malignancy, and operation was advised.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2. Coronary artery disease with previous coronary bypass.

A preoperative PET scan was consistent with malignant process
without signs of metastasis.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of admission, I performed a
bronchoscopy followed by a right upper lobectomy and
mediastinal lymph node dissection.  Operation went well.  The
patient was extubated in the operating room.  He had a small,
persistent air leak, but his chest tubes were able to be
removed on the fourth postoperative day.  He completed
rehabilitation and was discharged on the fifth postoperative
day on his usual medications and pain medication.  Follow-up
in the Thoracic Oncology Center was arranged.
