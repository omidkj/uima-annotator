History of Present Illness:
HPI: The patient is a 75 year old man with numerous vascular
risk
factors presenting with one day of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
and headache. He was feeling well until 0400 on [**2179-11-24**] when he
woke up with nausea and vomiting which recurred throughout the
day (nonbloody, nonbilious). He had associated watery diarrhea
at
least 4 times. He also had an associated headache that worsened
with vomiting; it was right frontal, monotone, and without any
associated neurologic symptoms such as visual change, weakness,
numbness, or severe or progressive lethargy. He didn't feel
tired
at all until he was evaluated in an OSH. This AM while
showering,
he experienced a fall: he felt that he lost his balance while
feeling nauseated and fell onto his back. There was no head
strike or loss of consciousness. He denies any other antecedent
symptoms. He denies any vertigo but did feel dizzy
("imbalanced"); this did not worsen with position change, but he
does feel more nauseated when sitting up.

He went to an OSH where his head was scanned and the NCHCT
showed
a large R cerebellar hypodensity, prompting a transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]
for further care. He was given Decadron 10 and Lorazepam after
which he felt drowsy.
