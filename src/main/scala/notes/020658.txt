History of Present Illness:
Pt is an 85 yo women w/PMHx significant for RA (?on chronic
prednisone), osteoporosis, HTN, HL, PUD, Dementia NOS, h/o
BOOP/COP (?on prednisone), duodenal ulcer who presents w/SOB,
dyspnea and non radiating chest pain at ortho clinic and sent to
ED at which time she was found to be hypotensive. Pt reported

time). Had a normal heart lung exam, JVP flat, no crackles.  Got
750 cc IVF and BP improved to 120/80 adn remained stable. BC and
UA were sent. Bedside echo was  ormal, no wall motion
abnormalities or fluid. Got aspirin. CE sent and trop flat, BNP
elevated and EKG showed NSR no ischemic changes. CXR patchy
infiltrates bilateraly and WBC 12, got Levo/CTX/vanco and
solumedrol 125. BP remained stable after fluids. Currently pain
free. Transferred to ICU for further workup and management in

CXR [**5-8**]:
FINDINGS: Compared to most recent prior, there is increased
interstitial pulmonary edema and vascular congestion.
Cardiomegaly is again noted. Aortic tortuosity is again seen.
There are no definite pleural effusions, although evaluation for
small effusions is limited withsingle frontal view. Note is made
of a large amount of stool in the descending colon.
IMPRESSION: Increased cardiogenic pulmonary edema.


Brief Hospital Course:
85 yo W h/o RA, osteoporosis, HTN, HL, PUD, Dementia NOS, h/o
BOOP/COP, duodenal ulcer who presents w/SOB, dyspnea and non
radiating chest pain at ortho clinic and sent to ED at which
time she was found to be hypotensive.

HYPOTENSION/REPSIRATORY DISTRESS: cxr with multifocal opacities
versus pulmonary edema.  Clinically given low grade temps and
leukocytosis more consistent with infection. She was treated
with levofloxacin and improved.  She rec'd a small bolus of IV
fluids in the ER and her BP improved, she had also rec'd
solumedrol 125mg IV. It is possible she had secondary adrenal
insufficiency in the setting of acute illness and chronic
steroid use as the cause of her low blood pressure, so she was
treated with prednisone 20mg po daily and this should be tapered
back to her home dose of 10mg po daily over the next 5 days.
ECHO was performed and was normal, LE ultrasound of left leg
which was mildly edematous was negative for DVT.

SACRAL INSUFICCIENCY FRACTURE: Subacute, noted on MRI of the L
spine and sacrum in early [**Month (only) 116**] at the [**Hospital6 **].
Managed non operatively and increasing mobility. She was treated
with pain controlling medications.  She was also noted to have
worsening of her chronic L1 L2 fractures on that MRI.  No acute
issues, no neurologic compromise.  Given delerium her pain
medication regimen was switched from oxycodone to tylenol
standing and tramadol standing with low dose of oxycodone prn
for breakthrough. Additionally added was calcitonin salmon nasal
spray daily for one month, as this may help with the pain of
spinal compression fractures (this was recommended by the
geriatrics consulting team while in the hospital).

DELERIUM / DEMENTIA: history of alzheimers dementia with some
slow worsening over the past 1 year, but especially over the
past month or so.  Prior to her admission to the [**Hospital1 **] earlier
this month she had been living independently however she was at
rehab for the past week prior to her hospitalization.  Given
possibility of worsening dementia precluding discharge to home
she was seen by geriatrics to help with long term disposition as
well as acute delerium issues- geriatric recommendations were as
follows to modify the pain medicatoins and timing and dose of
seroquel admission.  She still experiences occasional
hallucination and confusion in the evenings, however, on the day
of discharge she was alert, oriented times 4, and was able to
perform days of week backwards without difficulty or error.

PULMONARY EDEMA, DEMAND ISCHEMIA, ELEVATED TROPONIN: in the
setting of LVH and likely diastolic dysfunction the patient had
pulmonary edema on CXR, lung sounds likely pulmonary edema but
in the setting of BOOP/COP this was difficult to determine.  She
was diuresed w/ IV lasix.  Her troponin peaked at 0.07. ECG was
without significant change.   She was started on an aspirin
while her cardiac enzymes were trended and after trending
downward she was discharged on a full strength aspirin daily.
