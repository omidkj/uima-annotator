, ace. She was scheduled for CABG, but as she was taken to the
OR, was found to have mass in abdomen and Hct of 23. She was
sent to a stat CT scan and found to have retroperitoneal bleed
as well as very large renal cyst. She was hemodynamically
unstable. In light of findings, CABG was not done and balloon
pump and swan were placed and she was intubated. Patient was
fluid overloaded and diuresed. Platlets started trending low,
with a minimum of 64. Unclear at the time whether this was HIT,
or thromocytopenia secondary to balloon pump. Balloon pump was
dc/ed in the OR for concern with low platlets. She is on
BBlocker, Ace, CCB, statin, ASA. After SRA negative, She was
taken to the operating room on 10.9 where she underwent CABG x

subsequently maintained a stable Hct. She continues with wet to
dry dressings to her right groin.

HIT: Patient with dropping platelets after cath. HIT vs ballon
pump related thrombocytopenia. Patient admitted with platlets of
230's, nadir of 64. all heparin products were discontinued.
