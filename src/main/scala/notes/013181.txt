Patient presented to OSH with 2 days of cough. On day of
presentation, cough became productive with thick brown mucus and
hemoptysis. Also noted shortness of breath, wheezing and left
lateral rib pain with coughing. There he was hypoxic to the 80s,
and did not repsond to nebs. His oxygen requirement worsened and
had O2 sat of 80 on a NRB and was put on BiPAP. He was also
hypotensive to 69/43 and started on norepinephrine. He given
vancomycin, levofloxacin. He tolerated BiPAP poorly and was
intubated prior to transport. He was transported to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED

multifocal pneumonia. He was given cefepime and continued on
levophed. He was sedated with fentanyl and versed and paralyzed
with vecuronium. ABG here 7.05/72/79. Vent settings on transfer
were AC Vt 440, RR 28, FiO2 100, PEEP 16, vitals signs BP

Imaging:
CXR:
IMPRESSION:
Likely multifocal pneumonia with small bilateral pleural
effusions. However
given the density and mass like appearance of these lesions a CT
may be
obtained for further evaluation.


Brief Hospital Course:
60 yo M presents with severe multifocal PNA, respiratory failure
and septic shock.
.
1. Multifocal PNA/ARDS - severe, was difficult to ventilate.
Treated pneumonia with vanc/cefepime/levofloxacin and tamiflu.
Did low tidal volume ventilation, Vt < 6 mL/kg, keep pH > 7.15,
maintain sedation, paralysis. Initially increased respiratory
rate, decrease Vt, FiO2 as tolerated.  His oxygenation remained
stable but his hypotension was refractory to pressors, as below,
and he expired.
.
2. Septic Shock: Lactate 7.8, prognosis poor.  Was fluid
resucsiated and started on 4 pressors.  Was still hypotensive
and started on epi gtt.  Also receiving stress dose steroids.
Was profoundly hypotensive then PEA arrested.  CPR was not
performed. His family and a priest were at the bedide at his
passing.  Was likely related to streptococcal pneumonia,
although at the time of this discharge summary, no culture data
was back.
.
3. Hep C cirrhosis: stable, no signs of GI bleeding.  Did have
abdominal distention, but normal bladder pressure.
.
4. Coagulopathy: likely [**2-1**] liver dz, also consider DIC in
setting of sepsis, but DIC labs were normal when checked.
5. Lactic Acidosis: rreated wotj IVF with bicarb continuous at
125cc/hr
6. Goals of Care: Prognosis extremely poor, will discuss with
family; the family was at the bedside.  His HCP was his wife
[**Name (NI) **].  [**Name2 (NI) **] had two three children, multiple siblings and his
mother with him.
