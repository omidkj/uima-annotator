Pertinent Results:
[**12-17**] Echo: Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion
are normal. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the ascending aorta. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
no pericardial effusion. Post bypass: The patient is on a
Neosynephrine drip. LV function is preserved. The ascending
aorta is normal with no dissection flaps.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2159-12-17**] for elective
surgical management of her coronary artery disease. She was
taken to the Operating Room where she underwent coronary artery
bypass grafting to three vessels. Please see operative note for
details. In summary she had: Coronary artery bypass surgery x3
left
internal mammary artery graft to left anterior descending,
reverse saphenous vein graft to the marginal branch of the
posterior descending artery. Her bypass time was 78 minutes with
a crossclamp time of 61 minutes. She tolerated the operation
well and postoperatively she was taken to the intensive care
unit for monitoring. She was hemodynamically stable in the
immediate post operative period, she awoke neurologically intact
and was extubated. On POD# 1 she was weaned from all vasoactive
infusions and on POD# 2 she was transferred from the ICU  to the
step down unit for continued recovery. The chest tubes and
temporary pacing wires were removed per cardiac surgery
guidelines. She was started on betablockers and diuretics and
gently diuresed toward her pre-op weight. She was evaluated by
physical therapy and rehab was recommended. The remainder of her
post operative course was uneventful. She was discharged to
rehab at Lifecare of [**Location 15289**] on POD# 4.
