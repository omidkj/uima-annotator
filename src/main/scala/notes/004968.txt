BLOOD CX [**9-18**], [**9-21**]: PENDING
.
EKG: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Left
bundle-branch block. Left axis deviation. ST-T wave changes
consistent with the left bundle-branch block. Compared to the
previous tracing no significant change.
.
PA/lateral CXR FINDINGS: The heart and mediastinal contours are
stable with cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence. The
mediastinal contours are stable. The lungs are grossly clear.
There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle secondary to
small left pleural effusion. The pulmonary vasculature is
normal.
IMPRESSION: Stable cardiomegaly and small left pleural effusion.
No evidence for CHF.
.
NON-CONTRAST CT SCAN OF THE HEAD:
There has been no change from the previous examination of
[**2115-9-20**]. Malacic changes are noted in the right parietal
region attributable to the prior surgery for meningioma. There
are small low-density zones in the anterior aspect of the right
internal capsule attributable to chronic infarct.
CT angiogram of intravenous contrast material, multiplanar
reformatted images and additional 3-dimensional reconstructed
images.
FINDINGS: There is no evidence of aneurysm or flow abnormality.
Specifically, there is no evidence of flow abnormality in the
vertebrobasilar circuit or in the posterior cerebral arteries.
Note is made of an enhancing nodule subjacent to the operative
flap in the right parietal region, probably representing
recurrent meningioma. There is mild irregularity of the carotid
arteries in the post-cavernous and cavernous portions.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of posterior fossa circulation flow
abnormality. Enhancing nodule in operative bed consistent with
recurrent meningioma.
.
EEG IMPRESSION: Abnormal EEG due the presence of intermittent
slowing in
the right posterior quadrant, rasing the possiblity of a focal
subcortical dysfunction in that area. This was overshadowed by
the
background slowing and bursts of generalized delta frequency
slowing
suggestive of an encephalopathy; medications, infection and
metabolic
abnormalities are the most common causes. No epileptiform
discharges or
seizures were noted.
.
CT PULMONARY ANGIOGRAM WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: No
evidence of pulmonary embolus. The aorta contains
atherosclerotic calcifications with a small amount of mural
thrombus but is otherwise unremarkable. There are coronary
artery calcifications. The heart is enlarged. The airways are
patent to the segmental level bilaterally. There is a small
nodular opacity in the left upper lung lobe. There are minimal
dependent changes and subsegmental atelectasis at the lung bases
bilaterally. There is tiny left pleural effusion. There is a
3-mm nodule seen peripherally within the right upper lung lobe.
There are scattered bullae throughout the lung fields suggesting
emphysematous changes. There are small, non-pathologically
enlarged lymph nodes seen within the mediastinum, specifically
within the right paratracheal region measuring up to 8 mm. There
is no pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar, or mediastinal
lymphadenopathy. The visualized esophagus appears thickened
throughout its intrathoracic course. Within the visualized
abdomen, the visualized portion of the liver contains a 5-mm
hyperenhancing focus in the posterior aspect of the right lobe
of the liver, which is incompletely characterized on this
examination. The visualized portions of the spleen, stomach, and
adrenal glands are unremarkable.
BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
lesions. Degenerative changes are seen throughout the visualized
thoracic spine.
CT REFORMATS: Coronal, sagittal, and oblique sagittal
reformatted images confirm the axial findings.
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence for pulmonary embolus.
2. Small left upper lobe nodular opacity which may represent
scarring or early focus of airspace consolidation.
3. 3-mm right upper lung lobe nodule. This finding should be
followed with a CT of the chest in three months if the patient
has a primary malignancy; if there is no known primary
malignancy, the patient should receive a follow-up chest CT in
six months.
4. Small, 5-mm, enhancing focus in the posterior right lobe of
the liver, which is incompletely characterized on this
examination. When the patient's clinical condition improves, a
liver ultrasound may help for further characterization.
5. Possible thickening of the esophagus throughout its
intrathoracic course. Clinical correlation is recommended.
.
MRI EXAMINATION OF THE BRAIN WITH CONTRAST
Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain was obtained
without and with intravenous gadolinium administration.
Comparison is made to the prior brain MRI from [**2115-7-6**].
Patient has undergone previously known resection of a right
posterior frontoparietal convexity tumor presumably representing
a meningioma. There has been significant resolution of the
previously seen vasogenic edema. No midline shift or mass effect
is present.
The overall exam is degraded by repeated motion artifact.
Post-gadolinium enhancement images are significantly degraded by
motion artifact. There is a small area of residual enhancement
noted along the periphery of the posterior frontal convexity,
probably representing either residual meningioma or
postoperative meningeal scarring.
No acute territorial infarcts are seen within the brain on
diffusion images. Scattered foci of magnetic susceptibility are
noted within the left thalamus and right periventricular white
matter, unchanged in appearance since the previous exam
suggestive of possible small cavernous angiomas or changes
related to amyloid angiopathy. Scattered T2 hyperintense foci
are noted along the periventricular white matter suggestive of
chronic microvascular ischemic or gliotic changes.
IMPRESSION: Resolution of the previously noted vasogenic edema
since the prior exam of [**2115-7-6**], along the right posterior
frontal convexity. Patient has undergone resection of an
extraaxial lesion with postsurgical changes seen. There is no
underlying mass effect or edema on the current exam. The overall
exam is moderately degraded by repeated motion artifact. There
are several scattered foci of magnetic susceptibility
representing either small cavernomas or changes related to
amyloi
