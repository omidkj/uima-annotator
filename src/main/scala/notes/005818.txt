Erythema and ulceration in the gastroesophageal junction.
Erythema with a clean based ulceration with no bleeding, visible
vessel, or overlying clot was noted in the gastroesophageal
junction in the cardia. Erythema and erosion in the antrum
compatible with erosive gastritis.  Otherwise normal EGD to
second part of the duodenum.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient expired at 9:15 p.m. on [**2134-4-2**].  The day of [**2134-4-2**] was
eventful for a cardiac arrest around 10 a.m. with subsequent
ressucitation.  Patient was intubated and hypotensive, requiring
three vasopressors, likely secondary to sepsis.  Over the course
of the evening, he had multiple episodes of NSVT with
resolution.  Around 9 p.m., he had another episode of VT that
was torsades de pointes in morphology.  This degenerated into
VF.  The patient expired shortly afterward.  His family came to
the bedside at the time of torsades initiation.  They declined
an autopsy.

The below represents a summary of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course
prior to transfer to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]:

Assessment
64 y/o M with PMHx of Severe COPD, Diastolic Dysfunction and AVJ
ablation s/p PCM who presents with BRBPP, Hct of 13 and
supratherapeutic INR at 21.
.
# GI Bleed: Pt received 10 units of PRBCs and 5 units of FFP on
the 1st two days of presentation and had an inappropriate
increase in HCT from 13 to 24.  Pt started on Octreotide
ggt/Protonix gtt per GI and treated with Cipro as empiric
therapy in the setting of GI bleed.  Pt's coagulopathy improved
to 1.8 (also received Vitamin K 5mg PO for 3 days).  EGD
revealed clean-based ulceration and evidence of gastritis but no
active source of bleeding. Ciprofloxacin was discontinued. Pt's
HCT remained stable after EGD but continued to have dark black
stools.  Pt was prepped overnight on [**3-29**] for colonoscopy but
continued to have dark black stools. However, colonscopy was not
performed as anaesthsiologist was not available. Patient
continued to prep for the colonscopy, however this was
complicated by marked worsening of ascites and peripheral edema.
Given that patients hematocrit had remained stable and the
patient's volume overloaded state, the colonscopy was deferred
to a future date. His hematocrit remained stable...
.
# Coagulopathy: Pt on coumadin for atrial fibrillation.  INR
improved from 21.8 to 1.8 after 5 units of FFP and vitamin K 5mg
PO for 3 days.
.
# Cirrhosis: Pt with cirrhosis, ascites, splenomegaly & portal
HTN seen on RUQ U/S performed in [**10-19**], pt appeared to be unaware
of this diagnosis.  Pt did not have evidence of varices on EGD.
Hepatitis serologies were sent and were negative. [**Doctor First Name **] was
negative.Alpha-1 antitrypsin is pending at time of discharge.
With volumes resuscitation and bowel preparation, patient had
noteably worsening ascites and edema.  He underwent large
volume....

# Diastolic Dysfunction: Pt was given lasix in between blood
products but was not aggressively diuresed given his significant
GI bleed.  Home BP medications were held in the setting of
severe GI bleed.
.
# ARF: Likely pre-renal in etiology, hypovolemia secondary to
severe GI bleed.  Initial Cr 2.7 but improved to baseline of 1.9
with aggressive resuscitation.
.
# FEN: NPO for colonoscopy.
.
# Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, supratherapeutic INR, PPI
.
# Access: 2 PIVs
.
# Code: FULL CODE
.
# Communication: Patient and wife
.
