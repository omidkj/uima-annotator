History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 79yoM with a history of HTN, HLD, and previous
bladder neoplasm who developed acute RUQ pain two days ago. It
occurred suddenly, has been constant, dull, and nonradiating in
nature. He has been anorexic but denies nausea or vomiting. He
notes subjective fevers. He had confusion per his wife. His
urine has been cola-colored, but denies changes in his stool.
Has not noticed yellowing of skin. No previous history of
biliary or hepatic disease. Denies previous gall stones. He saw
his PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] referred him to the [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5871**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. There he was
febrile to 103.8F with systolic blood pressures in the upper 80s
which responded well to fluid resuscitations. He had a RUQ US
showing acute cholecystitis with a CBD diameter of 5mm. A CT
showed pneumobilia with scattered hepatic densities concerning
for abscesses.

He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**], initial VS were T99.4 BP83/42 HR80
RR18 Sat97RA. His lactate was elevated to 4.4, he received 2L
NC. His initial labs showed transaminitis of AST/ALT 198/167,
Tbili 4.9 Dbili 4.0, AP 34, Lipase 86. Surgery was consulted for
suspicion of cholangitis. He received zosyn, and was admitted to
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] briefly before undergoing ERCP, which revealed only sludge
in the gallbladder without note of stone. A stent was placed,
and he received tetracycline/clindamycin for suspected
claustridium given his pneumobilia. He was transferred back to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] in stable condition.

On arrival back to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**], his initial VS were T95.6 P82
BP118/39 RR14 Sat94%RA. He has mild RUQ pain but he is
comfortable and has no acute complain. On ROS, denies chest
pain, shortness of breath, N/V/D, no palps, myalgias,
arthralgieas, dysuria, hematuria.

CV: RRR
pulm: CTA b/l
abdomen: mildly softly distended, + BS, tender in the RUQ
tolight palpation, also tender in RLQ to deeper palpation
extremities: no LE edema, no cyanosis


Pertinent Results:
ERCP ([**2171-6-4**])
The common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right and left
hepatic ducts, biliary radicles and cystic duct were filled with
contrast and well visualized. The course and caliber of the
structures are normal with no evidence of extrinsic compression.
There was a filling defect in the middle third of the common
bile duct. This could represent stone fragment or debris. The
intrahepatics appeared normal, but the cholangiogram was limited
due to a small amount of contrast injection due to the patient's
sepsis from cholangitis. Successful placement of a plastic
biliary stent for decompression. Otherwise normal ercp to third
part of the duodenum

CT ABDOMEN ([**2171-6-4**])
1. Air within a mildly distended gallbladder with associated
pericholecystic stranding is compatible with acute
cholecystitis, with likely involvement of a gas-forming
organism.
2. Pneumobilia and ill-defined hypodensities in the left lobe of
the liver are concerning for infection with developing hepatic
abscesses, likely secondary to ascending cholangitis.
3. Calcifications in the region of the distal common bile duct
could be within the lumen of the duct, although could also be
within the pancreatic head. Further evaluation could be
performed with MRCP, if clinically indicated.
4. Right adrenal nodule, not fully characterized.
5. Well-defined hypodense liver lesions are likely simple cysts,
as described above.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. SIRS/sepsis with:
     - cholangitis
     - septicemia (GNR and anaerobic bacteremia)
     - liver abscess

Initially presented to an OSH with signs and symptoms suggestive
of cholangitis (RUQ pain, fever and hypotension; labs and
ultrasound indicative of biliary obstruction). He was taken for
ERCP on [**6-4**] which revealed gallbaldder sludge and a filling
defect in the middle third of CBD without stone presence or
extrinsic compression; a stent was placed.

Surgery recommended PTC drain to decompress the gallbladder
which was done on [**6-7**]. Blood cultures returned with klebsiella
and clostridium species. After initially treating broadly,
antibiotics were narrowed. Unfortunately, the patient worsened
with RUQ ultrasound and MRCP showed worsening perihepatic
abscesses; repeat blood culture returned positive for bacillus.
After drainage of the largest liver abscess by interventional
radiology and use of vancomycin (for empiric enterococcus),
pip-tazo, and fluconazole (for empiric fungal coverage) he once
again improved.

At the time of discharge, plan included;
     - antibiotics (vancomycin and ertepenem) until
cholecystectomy
     - cholecystectomy in [**4-3**] weeks
     - once cholecystectomy performed, both the gallbladder
drain and plastic stent can be removed

2. CHF, acute diastolic, resolved. After volume repletion was
grossly overloaded requiring diuresis.

3. Acute renal failure. Improved with supportive care.
