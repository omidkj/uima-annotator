Allergies:
Penicillins / Amiodarone / Clindamycin

Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1167**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, weight gain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Placement of R internal jugular central venous line.

Placement of L internal jugular dialysis [**Last Name (un) **].

Continuous venovenous hemodialysis.


History of Present Illness:
This is a 81 year-old male with a history of systolic and
diastolic CHF (EF 25-30%), tachy-brady syndrome awaiting
pacemaker, h/o atrial fibillation, CAD s/p stent LAD X 2, stent
LCx X 1, DM II, and CRI who presents from rehab with increasing
shortness of breath and weight gain. The patient reports he has
been in "poor health" since having a partial colectomy in
[**State 108**] this past [**Month (only) 956**] for colon CA. Since then, he has
experienced a 15 lb weight gain with worsening SOB. He was
recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] between [**4-13**] - [**4-28**] for cough and was
found to have a MRSA presumed hospital acquired pneumonia. He
was treated with a 14 day course of vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
During the hospital course, the pt was diagnosed with
tachy-brady syndrome as well as sotalol toxicity in the setting
of ARF, and EP was consulted who planned on pacemaker placement
once his ID issues had further resolved and discontinued
sotalol. Hospital course was also c/b a L brachial vein DVT and
was started on lovenox.

He was discharged to rehab where he was switched to IV lasix for
diuresis and followed by the renal team for worsening Cr up to
1.5; however, on review of OMR it appears pt's Cr had been at
1.5 prior to discharge. Per rehab notes, pt's weight was 208 lbs
on [**5-14**] and had increased to 212 lbs on [**5-16**] with a concordant
increase in O2 requirement, sating 91% on 5L NC. His lasix was
increased from 40 mg IV bid to 80 mg IV bid with reported poor
urinary output. The pt reports he has difficulty ambulating to
the restroom without shortness of breath. Denies CP,
lightheadedness. Endorses palpitations on the night prior to
presentation.

In the ED, initial vitals were T:96.4 HR:105 BP:122/68 RR:21
O2Sat:100% NRB, weaned down to 96% 3L NC. EKG showed no new
ischemic changes, CXR revealed worsening R and L sided pleural
effusions, R > L. He was given vancomycin 1 gm IV X 1,
ceftriaxone 2 gm IV X 1, azithromycin 500 mg IV X 1 for possible
HAP, started on lasix gtt @ 4 cc/hr and was admitted for further
evaluation and management.

Physical Exam:
Admission:
VS - 97.5 129/66 97 22 91% 2L NC FS 133 Wt 103 kg
Gen: elderly male, speaking in short senteces with mild SOB.
Oriented x3. Mood, affect appropriate.
HEENT: NCAT. Sclera anicteric. PERRL, EOMI. Conjunctiva were
pink, no pallor or cyanosis of the oral mucosa. No xanthalesma.

Neck: Supple with JVP of 15 cm.
CV: RR, normal S1, S2. No m/r/g. No thrills, lifts. No S3 or S4.

Chest: No chest wall deformities, scoliosis or kyphosis. Resp
were mildly unlabored, some accessory muscle use. Absent breath
sounds over R lung base, decreased BS half-up R lung field,
decreased breath sounds at L lung base with rales.
Abd: Soft, NTND. No HSM or tenderness. Abd aorta not enlarged by
palpation. No abdominial bruits. well healed surgical scar.
Ext: No c/c/e. No femoral bruits.
Skin: No stasis dermatitis, scars, or xanthomas. Stage II decub
ulcer over coccyx.

Pertinent Results:
CXR [**5-17**]: Interval enlargement of the right pleural effusion
with atelectasis of the right lower lobe difficult to entirely
exclude consolidation given the opacity introduced by the
effusion and atelectasis. If indicated, consider decubitus views
to assess for mobility of effusions.
.
CXR [**3-24**]: Improved pulmonary edema. Persistent right greater
than left pleural effusions and cardiomegaly.
.
Echo: The left atrium is dilated. The right atrium is markedly
dilated. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There
is moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-40
%). There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular
cavity is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are
thickened/fibrotic. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Renal U/S
1. No evidence of hydronephrosis.
2. Septated cyst within the left kidney, which does not meet US
criteria for a simple cyst. A 6-month follow-up ultrasound is
recommended to ensure stability.
