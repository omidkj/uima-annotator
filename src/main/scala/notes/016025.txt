Findings
Endo descending thoracic aortic stent was placed and was not
well visualized with TEE
LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
LA/LAA or the RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size. PFO is present.


LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and
systolic function (LVEF>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets.
Physiologic MR (within normal limits).

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. No TEE related complications. The TEE probe was
passed with assistance from the anesthesioology staff using a
laryngoscope. The patient was under general anesthesia
throughout the procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus
rhythm. Emergency study. Results were personally reviewed with
the MD caring for the patient.
Conclusions
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial appendage. A patent foramen ovale is
present. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
with normal cavity size and systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). There is no
pericardial effusion.

Impression:
Preserved biventricular systolic function.
Overall LVEF 55%.
No valvular abnormalities.
A descending thoracic aortic penetrating ulcer was seen which
was covered by the stent. There was a suspicious zone at the
level of the proximal descending thoracic aorta (left atrial
level) suggestive of an ulcer or a flap with very little flow
demonstrated in it at low scales as well. This information was
conveyed to the surgeons.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.

Brief Hospital Course:
Admitted [**12-18**] and underwent endo stent- grafting of descendung
aorta. Transferred to the CSRU in stable condition. Extubated
after surgery and weaned off esmolol drip that
evening.Transferred to the floor on POD #1 to begin increasing
her activity level. Hematology consult done for evaluation of
anemia and leukopenia. It was recommended that she follow-up
with rheumatology as an outpatient. MMS protocol CT done on POD
#3. Cleared for discharge to home on POD #4. Patient is to make
all follow-up appts. as per discharge instructions.
