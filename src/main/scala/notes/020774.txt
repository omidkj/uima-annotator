Physical Exam:
General: Somnolent but arousable and answers questions
appropriately.
HEENT: Sclera anicteric, MMM, oropharynx clear
Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales,
ronchi
CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 + S2, [**2-14**] holosystolic
murmur at the LUSB. Heart sounds distant.
Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present,
no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
GU: no foley
Ext: multiple skin tears and ecchymosis. No edema. 2+ pulses
bilaterally.
Neuro: CN grossly intact, [**4-13**] muscle strength of LE bilaterally,
LE weakness is greater on the left than right. Sensation intact
grossly. Rectal exam with normal rectal tone.
Back: No spinal tenderness on palpation. Pt has tenderness at
right paraspinal area without fluctuance or erythema.

Pertinent Results:
TEE:
The interatrial septum is aneurysmal. A small, stretched patent
foramen ovale is present at rest. Due to suboptimal technical
quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly
depressed. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. There are
simple atheroma in the aortic arch and descending thoracic
aorta. There is no evidence of mass/vegetation on the right
atrial/ventricular device leads. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. There are filamentous strands on the aortic
leaflets consistent with Lambl's excresences (normal variant).
Aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate tricuspid
regurgitation. No paravalvar abcess is seen. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
CT A+P:
IMPRESSION:
1. No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic process to explain the
patient's
symptoms on this limited non-contrast-enhanced CT.
2. New small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions with simple
fluid
attenuation. Trace pelvic fluid by the sigmoid colon.
3. Multiple pancreatic and renal lesions are better evaluated on
the prior
contrast-enhanced CT.
4. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.
5. A small amount of high density material, possibly oral
contrast, and air
within the excluded stomach, post gastric bypass. This could
result from
reflux from the jejuno-jejunal anastomosis, but gastro-gastric
fistula cannot
be excluded based on imaging.

WOUND CULTURE (Final [**2167-4-26**]):
      STAPHYLOCOCCUS, COAGULASE NEGATIVE.    >15 colonies.
         COAG NEG STAPH does NOT require contact precautions,
regardless of
         resistance Oxacillin RESISTANT Staphylococci MUST be
reported as
         also RESISTANT to other penicillins, cephalosporins,
carbacephems,
         carbapenems, and beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations
Rifampin

Brief Hospital Course:
Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: This was thought to be secondary
to sepsis acquired from his UTI.  He required presors for
several days in the ICU, upon callout from the ICU he was
normotensive off of pressors for several days.  Endocarditis was
ruled out with TEE.   The Pacer/AICD pocket ultrasound showed no
evidence of fluid collection or abscess in the right chest.
Abd/pelvis CT without appreciable abscess or cause for sepsis.
- ID recs going forward:
    - 10 days of gent which completed [**5-2**]
    - Ceftaz 1gm QHD for a total of 4 weeks from today (last day
[**5-28**])
    - Flagyl TID for two weeks past end of ABX (last day [**6-11**])
    - [**Hospital **] clinic to decide on cipro for 2-3 months past last dose
of ceftaz given retained pacer wires
.
Back pain:  Patient with chronic back pain, asking on a daily
basis to have a steroid injection in his spine.  Would not
instrument this patient while he is actively being treated for
bacteremia.  Patient is scheduled for follow-up in the spine
center on discharge.  Patient being lifted out of bed with
[**Doctor Last Name **], patient to work with PT.  Patient will benefit greatly
from ambulation with PT at the rehab.  Tylenol was maxed out.
We cautiously used opiates as they cause sedation in him.  He
will follow-up with [**Location (un) **] SPINE as scheduled.
.

staph grew from BCX at [**Location (un) **] and catheter tip here.  Completed
10 day course of gentamycin.
