Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2297**]
Chief Complaint:
Sepsis
Respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
endotracheal intubtation
central venous catheter placement


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] y.o. female with pmh of hypertension and
dementia who was brought in from [**Last Name (un) 1188**] house NH with 1 week
of lethargy, poor PO intake, and hypernatremia.  She was given
IVFs and IV cipro x 3 days for UTI.  Urine eventually grew
enterococcus.  1 day prior to admission, she is reported to have
aspirated, and given nebs/O2.  The morning of admission, whe was
more somnolent and hypotensive to the 80s.   She was sent to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, T 101.6, BP initially 70s systolic, improved to
100 after 4L IVFs.  She was somnolent with RR 16 and O2 sats
ranging from 86% NRB to 92% RA.  She was intubated for airway
protection.  Labs revealed leukocytosis (18.5), ARF, lactate
2.6, and Troponin of 0.16.  ECG neg for acute ischemic
abnormalities (no old).  U/A was dirty and CXR with patchy
bibasilar infiltrates concerning for pneumonia (? aspiration).
She was given Levoflox 750, Vanco 1gm, Flagyl 500mg, and ASA
325PR.  A R subclavian central line was placed.
.
Of note, a CXR on [**2192-10-14**] showed clear lungs.  Urine from
[**2192-10-14**] grew enterococcus but sensitivites could not be
performed.  Labs on [**2192-10-14**] showed WBC 10.3, Hct of 34, Plt
314, Na- 161, K-4.1, Cl-131, CO2- 21, BUN 46, and Cr 1.2.
.
ROS: Unable to obtain.

Past Medical History:
Lung cancer s/p resection [**2178**]
Dementia w/agitation
HTN
Recent UTIs

Social History:
Was living with her daughter until [**2192-7-4**], but then was
hospitalized for agitation/worsening dementia, and has been in
[**Hospital1 1501**] ever since.  >50 pack year smoking hx, quit in [**2178**].  No
etoh or illicits.  At baseline, AAO x1 and recognizes daughter.
Usually is agitated when medical care given.

Family History:
Noncontributory

Physical Exam:
VS: T 97.4  BP 104/61, HR 90, RR 23, 100% on AC/1.00/400/16/5
Gen: intubated, sedated
HEENT: dry mucous membranes
Neck: flat JVP
Lungs: bilateral rhonchi, R >L
Abd: soft, ND/NT
Ext: no edema
Skin: erythema over sacral region, no skin breakdown
Neuro: sedated but responds to pain (a-line placement)


Pertinent Results:
CXR [**10-19**]:
1.  ET and NG tubes in satisfactory position.
2.  Patchy bibasilar consolidations, left more than right,
which, in this
setting, may represent aspiration pneumonitis.
3.  Mild CHF with interstitial edema.
.
CXR [**11-7**]
FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**11-3**], there has been
some reduction in the left pleural effusion, possibly related to
a thoracentesis.  Little change in the effusion on the right.
Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with vascular congestion
is again seen.  Nasogastric tube has been pulled back and lies
within the distal esophagus.
.
CT head [**10-19**]: No hemorrhage
.
CT head [**10-27**]: IMPRESSION:  No significant change since the
previous study of [**2192-10-19**].  No acute hemorrhage identified.
Moderate-to-severe ventriculomegaly suggestive of normal
pressure hydrocephalus is seen.
.
MRI/MRA head [**10-28**]: Ventricles diffusely enlarged out of
proportion to the sulci with extensive deep and periventricular
white matter T2 hyperintensities. Above findings may represent
communicating hydrocephalus versus central atrophy. There is
fluid within the mastoid air cells bilaterally, and there is
prominence of the adenoidal tissue, which is unusual for the
patient's age. Normal MRA of the head.
.
EEG [**10-28**] and [**10-31**]: Encephalopathy. No seizure activity.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **]F h/o HTN, dementia, admitted to MICU given hypotension likely
[**1-6**] sepsis from urine Proteus, sputum Proteus; also respiratory
failure requiring intubation and ICU admission. Pt was extubated
[**10-31**] but remained only responsive only to pain off sedation.
Neuro workup unrevealing and pt eventually became more
responsive. Pt remained HD stable and afebrile after initial
resuscitation.
.
1. Sepsis: On admission, pt noted to be hypotensive to 70s in ED
with respiratory distress, prompting intubation. Pt was started
on vanc for h/o vanc-sensitive enterococcal UTI. Urine and
sputum grew Proteus sensitive to pip-taz; pip-taz therefore
started on [**10-22**]. Sputum grew OSSA, vanc d/c'd [**10-25**] and
nafcillin started to continue abx course for PNA. Pt completed
10 day courses of Zosyn and nafcillin on [**11-1**].and remained
afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
.
2. Respiratory failure: Pt initially intubated for airway
protection given somnolence and decreased O2sat during episode
of hypotension in ED, as well as suspected aspiration PNA per
CXR on admission. Sedation discontinued [**10-24**] with haloperidol
PRN for agitation, but pt continued to have depressed mental
status. Pt therefore maintained on intubation for airway
protection given altered mental status, however, tolerating
progressive weaning of ventilator settings. Pt was extubated
[**10-31**] without difficulty.
.
3. Altered mental status: Slowly improved over time. CT head
demonstrated no acute bleed, but moderate ventriculomegaly
possibly indicating normal pressure hydrocephalus. H2 blocker
removed for possible MS effects, and PPI started. Pt
demonstrated gaze preference to L per neuro consult exam.
Encephalitis was entertained, and toxic metabolic workup
initiated: TSH normal, RPR NR, UA unrevealing, EEG
(demonstrating encephalopathy), MRI brain w/ and w/o contrast
(demonstrating communicating hydrocephalus vs. volume loss, LFTs
(unrevealing). After discussions with family, it was decided to
defer an LP at this time but to repeat EEG which did not show
any new findings. Pt became somewhat more alert on [**11-2**]. It was
felt that her AMS is likely only slowly recovering given
underlying severe dementia.
.
4. Melanotic stools- Transient episode. Pt was placed on PPI IV
bid and ASA 325 was held. Hct remained stable.
.
5. AF: Pt had episodes of PAF with associated RVR. Has responded
very well to 12.5 mg PO metoprolol [**Hospital1 **]. Metoprolol was
eventually increased to 25 mg TID with good effect and continued
at this dose.
.
6. Anemia: Pt noted to have decreased hct to 21.5 on [**10-24**], with
hemolysis and iron studies nondiagnostic for hemolysis. Pt
received 2units PRBCs and has maintained hct. In addition,
episode of melanotic stools as above. However, Hct remained
stable around 25 without any further transfusions.
.
7. Acute renal failure: On admission, pt's creatinine 3.6
considered likely [**1-6**] to either prerenal vs sepsis-related ATN
etiology. Pt received IVF during intial resuscitaiton and ARF
resolved over the course of her MICU stay.

.
8. Hypernatremia: Na 161 on admission, considered possibly [**1-6**]
dehydration, and corrected with free water and intermittent D5W
boluses. Na trended down to low 140s.
.
9. Coagulopathy: On admission, INR 1.7 likely [**1-6**] poor
nutritional status given low albumin; received vit K PO x 3 days
with improvement. Remained stable.
.
10. Hyperglycemia: NPH titrated to maintain FS <150;
Hyperglycemia at night. Increased qHS Lantus to 12 units from
10.
.......................
On the floor, the patient spiked another temperature and was
restarted on vancomycin and Zosyn. Additional discussions were
had with the family, who wished to place a feeding tube for
nutrition. Plans were made for IR placement on [**2192-11-9**]. D
