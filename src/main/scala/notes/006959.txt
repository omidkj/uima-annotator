Brief Hospital Course:
53 year old male admitted after a fall at home.  The patient was
brought to [**Hospital1 69**] with positive
loss of consciousness from an outside hospital.  CT scan of the
chest showed a possible aortic intimal tear that was confirmed
by CT scan of the chest here that revealed a small descending
aortic tear, a right 1st rib fracture, and a small left
pneumothorax.  The patient was admitted to the surgical
intensive care unit for further management due to the aortic
tear and was followed by the cardiac service.  The patient's
blood pressure was aggresively controlled with lopressor IV that
was later switched to oral.  Also of note an aortic angiogram
was performed on the third hospital day that showed a possible
asymmetric ductus diverticulum though the appearance was more
suggestive of a small contained pseudoaneurysm.  A repeat CTA of
the chest on hospital day 4 did not show any changes in this
aortic tear.

The patient was also followed by the neurosurgery service for a
right T2 transverse process fracture.  AN MRI was performed upon
admission that revealed no ligamentous or soft tissue injury and
plan was for follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1132**] two weeks after discharge.

Also of note, the patient developed a urinary tract infection on
the 5th hospital day and was treated with levofloxacin and the
Foley catheter was changed and then removed shortly thereafter.

He had had three further chest x-rays for episodes of
desaturation prior to being transferred to the floor and some
bibasilar atelectasis and effusions were noted but no
pneumothorax was revealed   The patient was extubated on
hospital day 9 and was transferred to the floor at that time.

Throughout his stay the patient's pain was controlled with
morphine intravenously and then percocet by mouth upon transfer
to the floor.  The patient was also placed on CIWA scale for
alcohol withdrawal prophylaxis.  By the time of discharge the
patient was taking a regular diet, was walking indepedently and
had normal vital signs and on [**2169-1-19**] was discharged to home
with instructions to follow up with the trauma and cardiac
services.
