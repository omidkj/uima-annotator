Chief Complaint:
SOB, cough; transferred from MICU to medical floor [**2158-5-2**]

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none

History of Present Illness:
82 yo F with history of myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 2902**], who presented
with SOB and has a new oxygen requirement. She was diagnosed
with
MG 2-3 years ago after an episode while driving where her
eyelids
started to droop and she was unable to see (per pt's niece). Pt
reports that she is not sure if her vision was blurry or if her
lids were droopy. Pt then had a positive what sounds like either
a Tensilon or phyostigmine test. Prior to the diagnosis she had
been quite active, frequently playing golf. After the diagnosis,
the pt's niece also noticed that Ms. [**Known lastname 66821**] was having
trouble with other muscles, especially having a harder time
moving around without using a walker,a harder time keeping her
head up. Apparently she was on chronic prednisone and mestinone,
which may indicate that her symptoms were rather severe
requiring
aggressive treatment at baseline. Initially she took the
mestinone qid, but she seemed to improve and her dose was cut
down to TID a year ago. She was doing well on this dose, able to
walk without a walker.

At home she usually walks without any assistance. When she goes
out, she sometimes uses a cane. Because she was doing well, her
neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 66822**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 66823**], but the number is out
of
order) decided to reduce her mestinone to [**Hospital1 **]. After one week,
her niece noticed that she was having more trouble moving
without
her walker and that her eyes were drooping more. So the
mestinone
dose was increased again to TID after 1 week. Pt denies blurry
vision, swallowing difficulty, and trouble speaking.
.
At baseline pt has mild SOB with walking. At home does not use
oxygen.
She was not a smoker. Pt has had a gradulat weight gain over
several years but did not have a sudden weight gain prior to
admission. She also did not notice increased peripheral edema
prior to admission. She does sleep sitting up in a chair because
if she lies flat she has increased cough.
.
Pt presented to ED with abdominal bloating and cough x several
days. Per niece, on the day of admission, Ms. [**Known lastname 66821**]
complained of congestion and thought she might be coming down
with a virus, although she denied runny nose and sore throat.
That night, the pt was taken to the hospital due to her SOB. Her
niece reports that the bloating is not a new complaint.
.
ROS is otherwise negative for nausea, vomiting. She reports
regular BMs and diarrhea with mestinone. No abd pain.
Additionally, pt denied HA, diplopia, blurry vision, tinnitus,
vertigo, dysphagia, dysarthria, incoordination, focal
weakness/numbness.

Imaging:
[**5-16**] CXR for PICC placement:
IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of 45 cm single lumen PICC
line through the left basilic vein with the tip in the superior
vena cava.  The line is ready for use.
.
[**5-13**] CXR:
The left hemidiaphragm can now be seen indicating further
aeration of the left lower lobe.  Some atelectasis at the right
base is again seen.  No evidence of failure is present.
IMPRESSION:  Clearing of left lower lobe pneumonia.
.
[**5-1**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:  Retrocardiac opacity is left lower lobe pneumonia,
aspiration, or both.
.
[**5-1**] Bilateral lower extremity U/S:
IMPRESSION:  No DVT.
.
[**5-1**] ECHO:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild  pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is an anterior space which most likely
represents a fat pad, though a loculated anterior pericardial
effusion cannot be excluded.
IMPRESSION: Mild pulmonary hypertension with preserved
biventricular systolic function.




Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 66821**] was initially monitored in the Medical ICU from
[**4-30**] to [**5-2**], largely due to concern for respiratory
decompensation given her underlying myasthenia.  She was
evaluated by neurology in the emergency department, and her
respiratoy difficulties were thought most likely to be related
to her primary pulmonary processes (pneumonia and CHF), rather
than to myasthenic crisis.  Nevertheless, at some point her
steroid dose was increased from prednisone 15 mg daily,
alternating with 20 mg daily, to a maximum of solumedrol 125 mg
TID (this was not done per neurology team).  Her pneumonia was
treated with levofloxacin
