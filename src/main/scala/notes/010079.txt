Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2569**]
Chief Complaint:
found down, transfer from OSH with concern for Right MCA
infarct


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Endotracheal intubation
Bronchoscopy


History of Present Illness:
88 year old right handed woman with a large posterior scalp
mass but no other significant medical history who was brought to
an OSH after having been found down and head CT was concerning
for a right parietal infarct.

Per patient, several nights ago she slid out of her bed and has
been unable to move. She didn't initially note weakness or
difficulty with speech although her mental status limits the
history she provides. She reports she was able to call her
neighbors to do her shopping, and they apparently found her down
and called EMS and brought her to an OSH this evening.  At the
OSH, BP 177/81, she was lethargic, dry appearing, and mucuous
plugs were suctioned.  She was noted to be in afib with RVR. CT
head revealed small wedge shaped srea of low density in the
right
parietal lobe, atrophy, small vessel disease, and a posterior
scalp mass.  She was given 5mg lopressor x 2, CTX x 1, zithromax
x 1, 3L NS. LFTS increased, troponin 0.15, CK 611. CXRAY showed
left sided opacification. CT neck done without obvious fracture
and pelvic films also negative. Transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
managment.

In the ED, she is sfebrile, requiring 3L O2. Labs, CTA head and
neck requested, remains in afib and cardiology consulted with
initiation of a heparin gtt. Also given lopressor 5 mg x 1.
Troponin trended downwards. Given vancomycin and admitted to ICU
for further care.

Pertinent Results:
WBCs 17.5

CXR ([**1-2**])
One view. Comparison with the previous study done [**2156-12-30**]. There
is motion
artifact. Retrocardiac consolidation appears stable. There is
streaky
density in the lower right lung likely representing subsegmental
atelectasis and evidence of a small right effusion as before.
The heart and mediastinal structures are unchanged in
appearance. A feeding tube and PICC line remain in place.

EEG ([**12-29**])
This is an abnormal routine EEG due to slowing and
disorganization of the low voltage background, indicative of a
moderate
to severe encephalopathy. Toxic, metabolic and infectious
disturbances
are common causes. No evidence of epileptiform discharges,
electrographic seizures or nonconvulsive status epilepticus was
seen
during this recording. There were no prominent focal
abnormalities, but
encephalopathies may obscure focal findings.

CT (head)[**2156-12-22**]
1. Acute infarction, predominantly in the right MCA territory,
but also
involving left corona radiata, redemonstrated. No evidence of
extension, new infarction, or hemorrhagic conversion.

2. Large posterior scalp soft tissue mass redemonstrated, again
possibly
representing extensive venolymphatic malformation or hemangioma,
or other
non-aggressive process, with other differential diagnostic
considerations as outlined in the report of very recent MRI.

TTE [**2156-12-20**]
The left atrium is moderately dilated. No thrombus/mass is seen
in the body of the left atrium. No atrial septal defect is seen
by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is
mild to moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF =
40%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There
is no ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.


Brief Hospital Course:
Stroke
Patient was admitted after being found down. She was found to
have a right parietal infarct. Her exam worsened during the
hospitalization and she required intubation for pulmonary
distress. Stroke was thought secondary to cardioembolic source
and patient was found to be intermittently in Atrial
Fibrillation. Vessel imaging and cardiac echo revealed no
dissections and no vegetations. She was on heparin therapy and
bridged to coumadin while she had a NGT in place. She pulled out
the tube on [**2157-1-2**] and decision was made not to replace it.

Pneumonia
Patient was in respiratory distress and required intubation. She
had two bronchoscopies which did not reveal any culture positive
organisms. She was extubated after discussions with her HCP, but
continued to be in respiratory distress requiring 40% facemask
with sats in the 80s-90s. Decision on [**2157-1-3**] to make CMO after
discussion with her HCP.

Comfort Measures
Discussion was had with her HCP [**First Na
