Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 613**]
Chief Complaint:
CC: coffee ground emesis, black diarrhea

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Upper endoscopy

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 46 year old woman with EtOH/HCV cirrhosis,
grade 1 varices and portal gastropathy who presents with n/v/d,
abdominal pain and coffee ground emesis since this am.  In the
ED, she was initially hemodynamically stable with maintained
Hct.  NG lavage revealed red blood that cleared after 750 cc.
She also passed large amounts of melena.  In the Ed she was
given 2 units of FFP, vitamin K, levofloxacin 500 mg x 1,
octreotide gtt, and 1 liter of NS.

Upon stabilization she said that her only complaint was RLQ abd
pain which was somewhat worse with movement, it was
non-radiating and intermittent.  She has chronic diarrhea for
the past several years, but had not experienced any in the few
days prior to admission.  On review of systems she denied
headache, dizziness, chest pain, SOB or cough.  She did feel
weak and described having a sore throat.  She has no history of
easy bruising or bleeding problems.  She denied having any GU
symptoms including hematuria prior to admission.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient is a 46 year old woman with history of alcohol/hep C
cirrhosis, portal hypertension and recent episode of colitis who
presented with an upper GI bleed.
.
1.) Upper GI bleed: The patient presented with a UGIB.  She was
volume expanded with normal saline and a total of 9 pRBC units.
She underwent EGD to evaluate the source of her bleeding.  There
were no active bleeding vessels visible during the procedure and
none of the lesions detected required intervention.  The leading
culprit was thought to be the large duodenal varix.  She
continued on the IV PPI twice daily while in the MICU, but this
was decreased upon discharge to once daily oral dosing.  Her
hematocrit stablized in the mid 30s but time of discharge and
she exhibited no evidence of re-bleeding.  She was discharged in
stable condition, tolerating oral food and medication.  She was
referred to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] in the Liver Center with
the consideration that a TIPS procedure might be therapeutic to
treat her duodenal varix that was the presumptive cause of the
bleeding.

.
2.) Hypotension:  In the ED the patient became hypotensive to
sbp ~80s.  She was relatively asymptomatic at the time and was
able to mentate well.  She was vigorously volume expanded with
saline and blood products and transfered to the MICU for close
observation.  Following stabilization and transfer to the
medical floor, she stated that her blood pressure has always run
low and 80s and 90s systolic are not uncommon for her.  Her home
diuretics were held during the hospitalization, and only the
furosemide at a low dose was to be re-started at discharge.  Her
blood pressure increased by time of discharge and was stable
with systolic [**Location (un) 1131**] in the 110s.

.
3.) Hypoxia:  With the history of diastolic CHF the patient
developed mild hypoxia  following the vigorous volume expansion
with saline and blood.  This was corrected with natural diuresis
and supplemental oxygen.  Upon transfer to the medical floor her
oxygen saturation was 97% on room air alone.

.
4.) Thrombocytopenia:  The patient has a baseline platelet count
range 110s over the past 4 months.  This could be secondary to
hypersplenism.  However the level dropped on admission with a
nadir of 48,000.  This was thought secondary to octreotide
(which was later stopped) on top of chronic hypersplenism,
however, other possiblities were entertained included secondary
to the PPI, ITP or DIC, and HIT.  The smear did not reveal
appreciable shistocytes and the DIC panel including trend did
not support DIC.  Heparin was held.  There were no thombotic
events to support an immune HIT picture.  The platelet level
should be followed as outpatient for return with consideration
for discontinuing the PPI if the platelet count does not
recover.

.
5.) Liver Disease:  The patient has a history of alcohol and Hep
C cirrhosis.  The last viral load was measured in [**2175-4-9**] with
600-700,000 copies/mL detected.  Her INR has slowly increased
over the past year now stabilizing at 1.7 prior to discharge.
The total bilirubin has fluctuated highly over the past year but
during this hospitalization was toward the low of the the range
at 3.4.   CT scan demonstrated a increase in her splenic
diameter compared to [**2176-3-9**]. At discharge she was re-started
on low dose nadolol and furosemide and scheduled for Liver
Center follow-up.

.
6.) Hematuria:  The patient reported no history of hematuria
prior to admission.  However, a large RBC count was measured in
a sample from a foley catheter.  This was thought to be
secondary to a traumatic foley placement.  A follow-up UA after
the foley was removed showed a decrease in the RBC by more than
half the prior level.  Routine UA follow-up is recommended to
confirm the clearance of the urine.

.
7.) Abd pain: The patient described a pain in her RLQ.  Upon
examination she was more tender in a diffuse location instead of
a more focal area.  Potential diagnoses included a re-lapse of
her pancoltis from [**3-14**], appendicitis, mesenteric adenitis,
constipation, or less likely ovarian cyst.  A abdominal CT was
obtained that revealed portal gastropathy and mesenteric
collaterals, resolved colitis, but no obvious source for abd.
pain.  Her bowel regimen was changed and she was tolerating food
upon discharge.

.
8.) Chronic Diarrhea/Bloating:  This was thought likely
secondary to celiac sprue (+FH, duodenal biopsy + for early
disease, TTG reported as + although no result in OMR).  She was
prescribed a gluten free diet and asked to make an appointment
with the dietician whom she had already contact[**Name (NI) **].  A nutrition
consult was made for some inpatient teaching.

.
9.) FEN:  tolerating full regular diet.

.
10.) Prophy: on PPI, had pneumoboots while on bedrest but later
was ambulating well.

.
11.) Code Status: the patient remained full code througout her
hospitalization.

.
12.) Dispo: home with Liver Center follow-up.
