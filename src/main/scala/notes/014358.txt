[**Hospital1 18**] on [**2198-2-15**] after an 8 day stay for hypoxemia after trach
exchange. He was discharged to a MACU for a 2 week stay prior to
discharge to home. Now complains of 1 week of increasing dyspnea
and increased secretions. He denies fever or chest pain. He is
having increasing wheezing. This culminated at church yesterday
and inability to completely suction secretions from trach. He
presented to ED yesterday ([**2198-3-4**]) and was sent home after no
acute process identified on CXR.
.
Has new home ventilator and patient feels that suctioning tube
is too narrow or that suction not as strong as in rehab. Reports
that dyspnea at night is relieved by unhooking self from
ventilator. Had appointment have home care company make
adjustments to vent at 9 AM on [**2198-3-5**], but they did not show
so he came back to ED for further eval.
.
Vital upon presentation to the ED were: T 97.9, HR 90, BP
150/93, RR 20, O2Sat 100% RA. In the ED he had a CXR with
question of new infiltrate and thus patient was started on
ceftrizxone and azithromycin. Patient additionally given
steroids and nebulizers due to concern for wheezing. Given
elevated PORT score, ED decided to admit to the hospital. Given
patient's ventilator use at night, a MICU bed was requested.

IMAGING:
[**2-1**] CXR:
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild bibasilar opacities, non-specific but may be chronic or
represent
atelectasis. However, infection and/or aspiration cannot be
excluded.
2. Interval decrease in previously seen mild pulmonary edema.
.
[**2-2**] CXR:
IMPRESSION: Mild congestive heart failure, mild cardiomegaly.

Brief Hospital Course:
73 yo M with severe obstructive sleep apnea s/p trach and
recently discovered central sleep apnea, presented with dyspnea,
wheezing, and increasing secretions.  Was likely due to poor
humidification and incomplete suctioning.
.
#. Dyspnea:
Most likely trach occlusion from secrections as neither suction
cath nor bronchoscope could by passed at presentation to MICU.
s/p bronchoscopy and trach change at bedside in MICU with
significant improvement in dyspnea. Possible that insufficient
trach care in last week led to slowly progressive trach
occlusion that culminated on dat prior to presentation. In
absence of leukocytosis and fevers and no discrete infiltrate on
CXR, will not treat for pneumonia at this time despite increased
secretions.  Patient received abx in the ED, but they were not
continued given that CXR showed no pneumonia.  He felt well
after trach change and had teaching about cleaning and
suctioning, and appropriate cuff inflation. Also had speech eval
for PMV teaching.  IP did evaluate him while here, and after
trach change ovennight, had no other interventions at that time.
 Case management coordinated with his home care provider for [**Name Initial (PRE) **]
new ventilator at home with a humidifier that should minimize
secretions and mucuous plugging.  His home care provider will
meet him at home tonight to help him with the new vent and will
explain appropriate cuff inflation and deflation.  He has follow
up [**2198-3-13**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].
.
#. Sleep apnea:
Obstructive component is typically handled by trach; therefore,
after change of trach and dyspnea improved, just got him back to
his home settings.  He is on PS 5/5, fiO2 30% with backup RR of
10.
.
#. Diabetes mellitus:
changed to insulin sliding scale in house, switched back to PO
as outpatient.
.
#. Hypertension:
BP well controlled, continued his current meds.
.
# ARF: had Cr rise from 0.9 to 1.4; was making appropriate urine
and eating and drinking well.  Would recommend rechecking as
outpatient, but there was no renal toxic insults obvious while
patient was here.
