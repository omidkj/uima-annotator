Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1257**]
Chief Complaint:
Flu like illness

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
48 yo female with history of hepatitis C, COPD, and
hypothyroidism, presents with flu like symptoms for 5 days.  The
patient reports nausea and vomiting associated with poor PO
intake for the past five days.  She also reports right sided
flank pain and myalgias for the same amount of time.  Today, she
developed cough that is productive of white sputum.  She denies
other upper respiratory symptoms.  She denies urinary symptoms,
headache, lightheadedness and fever.  She denies sick contacts,
however reports to a methadone clinic daily and has been
spending much time with her husband who is admitted here at
[**Hospital1 18**].  Today, she reported confusion, that she describes as
similar to the prodrome of her seizure, but denies seizure
activity today.  Of note, the patient has not been taking her
levothyroxine for the past few months, secondary to the stress
of taking care of her husband.

In the emergency department her initial vital signs were T 96 HR
53 BP 79/41 RR 18 O2 96.  Her labs were significant for WBC
23.0, elevated CK 353, elevated BUN/Crn 47/2.3, elevation of AST
to 846 (baseline 29), ALT to 712 (baseline 29), with normal AP
and Tbili with a mild coagulopathy, INR 1.3.  Her tox screen was
positive for barbituates and methadone, she is on methadone as
an outpatient.  Of note her tylenol level was negative.  She had
an Abd US which showed evidence of an echogenic liver, but no
source of intraabdominal infection.  A CXR showed no evidence of
pneumonia.  A head CT showed a mass, which is likely stable from
prior.  She received a total of 5L of NS for hypotension,
vancomycin and zosyn for empiric antibiotic coverage.  She also
received 100mg of hydrocortisone as well as 0.2mg of narcan when
her blood pressures did not respond to IV fluids.  She received
a total of 2 amps of glucose for fsbg of 50.  On transfer to the
ICU her vital signs were T 96.5 BP 96/67 HR 63 RR 15 O2 94% on
4L.

On arrival to the ICU she reports continued nausea and fatigue.
Otherwise, she reports is very thirsty and feels better than
when she arrived in the ED.

Studies:

[**2120-1-17**] Chest Xray: No acute intrathoracic process.

[**2120-1-18**] Chest Xray: Bibasilar pneumonia.

[**2120-1-18**] TTE: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular
wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
function are normal. Quantitative (3D) LVEF = 59%. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal
with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is
no pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional
biventricular systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation.

Brief Hospital Course:
48 year old female with history of chronic hepatitis c, seizure
disorder, brain hemangiomas admitted for hypotension, acute
hepatitis, and acute renal failure.

#. Hypotension/Shock:  She initially presented to the ED with
hypotension that was responsive to aggressive fluid
resuscitation.  She was transiently on phenylephrine and
dopamine on admission to the ICU, but was quickly weaned off
pressors.  It was felt that she had hypovolemic shock.  The
etiology of the hypovolemia was not entirely clear, but
possibilities include toxic ingestion, infectious process,
hypothyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency.  After fluid
resuscitation, her blood pressures stabilized and she was
transferred to the floor.

#. Pneumonia: She presented with history of cough and fatigue,
and her initial chest xray on admission showed no acute process.
 A chest xray the day after admission showed bibasilar
pneumonia.  She was started on levofloxacin for
community-acquired pneumonia.

#. Hypothyroidism: She had not been taking her thyroid
medication as an outpatient,and was restarted after admission.
She was seen by the endocrinology team who did not feel that her
presentation was related to her hypothyroidism, despite an
elevated TSH to 7.5.

#.  Transaminitis:  She had transaminitis on admission that was
felt to be related to hypotension.  Her transaminases
downtrended.  She was negative for acute EBV and other viral
studies were pending (HIV, CMV, or Hep A, B, D, or E). She was
asked to see her PCP in regards to the results

#.  Acute renal failure:  Given her BUN to Crt ratio, granular
and hyaline casts on sediment and picture of hypovolemia on
presentation, her acute renal failure was most likely prerenal.
It recovered completely

#.  Unlikely UTI/Pyelonephritis:  She had a urinalysis
consistent with a UTI on admission and was treated with
levofloxacin as above. No urinary symptoms and this seemed
unlikely

#.  Seizure Disorder/Brain Hemangioma:  She was continued on her
home phenobarbitol.

#   History of susbtance use:  She was continued on home
methadone dosi
