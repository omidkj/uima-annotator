History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 1140**] is a 69 year old man with a past medical history of
diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peripheral [**Known lastname 1106**]
disease s/p lower extremity percutaneous revascularization, CVA
secondary to left carotid stenosis s/p endovascular stenting,
presenting from [**Hospital 882**] hospital after developing chest pain
this morning.  He initially presented to [**Hospital1 882**] with a
complaint of nausea, decreased oral intake and dark tarry stools
x5 days.  His hematocrit at presentation was 23.7 and he was
given 2U PRBC.  He underwent colonoscopy and endoscopy that
showed multiple polyps and ulcerations; 3 esophageal ulcers, 5
gastric ulcers, 2 sessile polyps in ascending colon, 2 in the
transverse colon and two in the splenic flexure and three just
distal to the anus, with multiple biopsies obtained.
.
This morning, he acutely developed substernal chest pain, rated
[**7-5**], worsened with inspiration and non radiating, not
associated with nausea or diaphoresis. He also desaturated to
88%, developed pallor and malaise. Temp 98, HR 132, BP 147/93,
92% on 2L NC. No complaints of arm, neck or jaw pain.  He was
given sublingual nitroglycerin, aspirin, atorvastatin 80mg. Labs
revealed CK of 25, TropI 0.36, ABG 7.41/31/113. Second set of
cardiac enzymes revealed CPK 36 Tn 1.32. Cardiology was
consulted and Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended transfer to tertiary center
given ongoing GI bleeding and likely ACS.
.
On arrival, he reported his pain had resolved and he was only
experiencing some numbness of his left superior foot. Denied any
active chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath, dizziness or any
other symptoms.
.
On review of systems, he reports a prior history of stroke
(residual mild left sided deficits), denies prior deep venous
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the time of surgery,
myalgias, joint pains, hemoptysis. Cough for the last 3 days. As
per HPI patient with black tarry stools. He denies recent
fevers, chills or rigors. Denies exertional buttock or calf
pain. All of the other review of systems were negative.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for dyspnea on exertion
with less than one block of walking, denies paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or
presyncope.

STUDIES:
.
EKG ([**2122-8-21**] 4:57am, 8/10 chest pain)
Normal sinus rhythm at 130, with anteroseptal 1-2mm ST
elevations involving V1 to V4, with reciprocal inferior ST
depressions in leads II, III and aVF.
.
EKG ([**2122-8-21**] 5:06 am, 2/10 chest pain)
Normal sinus rhythm at rate of 116, with 1mm ST elevationss
involving V1 ot V4, with reciprocal inferior ST depressions in
leads II, III and aVF.
.
EKG ([**2122-8-21**] 14:18, 0/10 chest pain)
Normal sinus rhythm at rate of 90, resolved ST elevations, low
voltage and T wave flattening on precordial leads. No Q waves,
normal axis.
..
CXR ([**2122-8-21**]):
FINDINGS: Small bilateral pleural effusions are new. There is
increased
opacity at the lung bases bilaterally which may represent lower
lobe
distribution of pulmonary edema in this patient with upper lobe
emphysema.
However, imaging alone cannot exclude bilateral infectious
process. The lungs are otherwise clear. Cardiomediastinal and
hilar contours are normal. There is a new left internal jugular
central venous line ending in the upper SVC. There is no
pneumothorax. Visualized soft tissue structures and bony thorax
are normal.
IMPRESSION:
1. Probable dependent distribution of edema in setting of upper
lobe
emphysema and less likely infection or aspiration.
2. New left IJ central line in good position with no
pneumothorax.
.
Stress Test [**2122-8-25**]
The patient was infused with 0.142 mg/kg/min of dipyridamole
over 4
mintues. The patient had no back, neck, arm, or chest pain
during
infusion or in recovery. The baseline STT wave abnormalities did
not
change during infusion or during recovery. The rhythm was sinus
with
frequent isolated apc's. There was appropriate hemodynamic
response. The
dipyridamole was reversed with 125mg of aminophylline. No
anginal type symptoms and no signficant ST segment changes from
baseline. Nuclear report to be sent separately.
INTERPRETATION:
Left ventricular cavity size is normal.  Rest and stress
perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the
left ventricular myocardium. There is a soft tissue attenuation
in the distal anterior wall, but no definite perfusion defect.
Gated images reveal normal wall motion.
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 54%.
Compared with the study of [**2120-9-4**], there is no significant
change.
IMPRESSION: Soft tissue attenuation in the distal anterior wall,
but no
definite perfusion defects are seen. Normal cavity size and
function.


Brief Hospital Course:
In summary, this is a 69 year old man with a history of
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, severe [**Year (4
