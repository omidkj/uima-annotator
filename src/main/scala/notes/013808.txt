History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 43 woman with hx of CVID on recurrent IgG infusions
(last dose on [**8-28**]) and colitis concerning for Crohn's on Asacol
and prednsione who was readmitted to [**Hospital3 **] with
worsening diarrhea, found to have enterocolic fistula,
complicated by lower GI bleed, and is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
more subspecialty consultation in complicated undiagnosed
patient.

She was first admitted to [**Hospital3 **] from [**7-11**] - [**2168-8-8**]
for chronic abdominal pain with 45 lb weight loss since
[**Month (only) 956**].  CT showed thickening of descending colon, multiple
loops of thickened small bowel.  She had a normal upper scope.
Colonoscopy showed with 5 cm segment of ulcerated mucosa in
descending colon.  Biopsies showed nonspecific colitis,
inconclusive, v. c/w IBD.  Upper GI small bowel follow through
showed improvement in small bowel loops compared to CT scan and
some mild abnormalities with 1 thickened segment in the
mid-abdomen.   Given her significant weight loss, she was
started on TPN.  She was started on Asacol and did have some
improvement.  She was discharged home on a 5 day course of
prednisone (not clearly for IBD).  D/C weight was 101 lbs.

She was home for 1.5 weeks, off TPN.  A couple of days prior to
her readmission, she began experience explosive diarrhea,
multiple liquid episodes a day (up to 10), nonbloody.  She did
report black stools, on Pepto-Bismo.  She also had worsening of
her chronic, constant, stabbing LLQ abdominal pain, rating
>[**11-20**].  She was eating clear liquid supplement and small meals,
which did not worsen her abdominal pain.  No nausea, vomiting at
that point.  No fevers, chills, nightsweats.

She was readmitted to Sturdy on [**2168-8-26**].  C. diff toxin was
negative.  Stool cultures are pending.  Repeat CT showed
descending colon colitis with inflamed loops of small bowel
adjacent to it and ?enterocolic fistula, concerning for Crohns.
Patient was started on Cipro, flagyl, and IV solumedrol; TPN
continued.  On [**2168-9-12**], patient started to have a lower GI bleed
with hemorrhagic shock.  Initial HCT was 30, fell to 25.  After
5 units of PRBCs, her HCT increased to 33.  Flex sig. to
descending colon did not reveal active bleeding but verifed
enterocolic fistula.  No definitive diagnosis determined yet.
Vitals at time of transfer were:  Vitals: 98.4, 91, 106/64, 16,
99% on room air.

Her last episode of BRBPR was on [**2168-9-13**].  Since then her
Golytely prep, she had no further bowel movements.  She is NPO.

[**2168-9-14**] Flex sig:  The colonoscope was introduced into the rectum
and passed through a normal left colon where there was blood and
brown liquid stool to teh level of 60cm from the anal verge.
The whole left colon appeared to be fixed.  There was an
ulcerated area and the scope went itno a lumen which appeared to
be small bowel.  Biopsies of ?small bowel as taken.  Probably
large mouth fistual connecting left colon and small bowel.

Brief Hospital Course:
43yo F with hx of CVID on q3 month IVIG infusions (last dose on
given [**9-17**]) and colitis concerning for Crohn's on Asacol and
prednsione who was readmitted to [**Hospital3 **] with worsening
diarrhea, found to have enterocolic fistula, complicated by
lower GI bleed, and is transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for more
subspecialty consultation in complicated undiagnosed patient.
Colonic mass was found to be due to B-cell lymphoma.

She was transferred to the hematology/oncology service and she
recieved five days of [**Hospital1 **].

On [**2168-9-30**] she developed increased abdominal pain and was found
to have a perforated bowel.  She was taken emergently to the OR
for exploratory laparotomy with resection of sigmoid and
descending colon and end colostomy.  Her course was complicated
by pan-cytopenia secondary to her previous chemotherapy.
Heme/onc was following and she recieved daily neupogen and
vanc/[**Last Name (un) 2830**]/voriconazole until her total granulocyte count passed
1000 when the neupogen and vanc were discontinued.  Per heme/onc
she will continue meor/voriconazole for 14 days after her total
granulocyte count reached 1000.  Her post-op course was
otherwise uncomplicated.  Her diet was very slowly advanced and
she was transitioned from PCA to liquid PO pain meds and a
fentanyl patch once she was taking clears.  She continued to
work with physical therapy.  All of her blood cultures post-op
remained negative.  She recieved a CT on [**2168-10-12**] which
demonstrated no abscesses.
