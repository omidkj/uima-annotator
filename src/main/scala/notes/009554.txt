History of Present Illness:
History taken mainly from OSH reports ast pt is intubated.
Briefly, this is a [**Age over 90 **] yo female with history of CAD, s/p MI in
[**2125**], htn, type II diabetes, PE and CHF who was transferred from
[**Hospital3 7362**] for CHF exacerbation. The pt initially presented
to [**Hospital3 7362**] complaining of intermittent chest pain x 2
days and SOB. EKG showed ST depressions in I and avL, V2-V6.
Troponin I elevated, CK peaked at 752. Cardiology was consulted
and medical management was pursued. In addition the patient was
thought to be in acute diastolic heart failure, and started on a
lasix and nitro drip, along with C-PAP to help with respiratory
distress. The pt's respiratory status worsened, and she was
subsequently intubated. Following intubation she became
hypotensive and started on peripheral neo. At the family's
request, she was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
After talking with her grandson, he states her chest pain and
SOB have been chronic for the past 10 months, typically relieved
with nitropaste. He denies any recent change in quality,
frequency, or quantity of her chest pain, no recent SOB or
increased DOE. He states she was brought to the hospital by her
daughter as she was unable to walk and found crawling from the
bedroom to the bathroom.
.
Review of systems was unobtainable other than as stated above
due to the fact that the patient was intubated.
