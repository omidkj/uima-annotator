Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath, increased angina

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
central line placement


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year-old woman with a history of CAD s/p
CABG in 10/84 with redo in 11/84, stent to left subclavian in
[**6-17**] and repeat dx cath without intervention in [**10-18**], EF of 35%
on echo in [**2145**], atrial fibrillation diagnosed in [**2146**] managed
with rate control and anti-coagulation, hypertension, lipids and
asthma/possible COPD (no PFT's noted in record/no smoking
history) admitted now with SOB/unstable angina.  The patient's
current symptomatology began last friday [**12-12**] when she
developed URI symptoms including nasal congestion and cough.
Since then she has noted increased dyspnea, increased episodes
of her anginal pain including at rest and cough productive of
yellow/celery colored sputum.  Dyspnea has increased to point
where she has trouble with stairs now where recently she has
not.  Has dry cough at baseline attributed to Mavik, but her
current cough is different.  Has also had significantly
increased fatigue over this time.  Takes combivent or albuterol
with some relief of shortness of breath.  Her SOB brought her to
see her PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1262**].  CXR was obtained and revealed no acute
process. Other history from that visit is unobtainable.
Last night she had palpitations and her shortness of breath
subsequently worsened which ultimately brought her to [**Hospital1 18**]
today.
Reports taking all her medications.  Has had some dietary
indiscretion recently including salted fish last friday and
dining out recnetly.
Also reports increased stress and exposure to dogs at family
members house.
Denies fever or chills.  Denies feeling dizzy, syncope. NO
weight loss. Appetite has been good.

PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: The patient is S/P CABG.
There is a
vascular stent projecting above the aorta again demonstrated and
unchanged.
The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. No evidence of
failure. The
lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia. No evidence of CHF.

(pulmonary vascular congestion, cardiomegaly)

PROCEDURE DATE: [**2147-11-15**]
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
Chest pain. Prior CABG. S/P subclavian stent.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Native three vessel coronary artery disease with extensive
bridging
collaterals of the RCA.
2. Known occluded saphenous vein grafts.
3. Patent LIMA to LAD.
4. Patent left subclavian stent.
5. Mild mitral regurgitation.
6. Mild systolic ventricular dysfunction.
7. Mild right common-femoral vascular disease.
COMMENTS:
1. Coronary arteriography in this right dominant system showed
native
three-vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild luminal
irregularities. The LAD artery was occluded in the mid-vessel.
The left
circumflex artery was proximally occluded with two distal OMs
with a
"jump" segment filling via left to left collaterals. The RCA was
proximally occluded with many bridging collaterals supplying the
distal
RCA and posterior LV branches.
2. Saphenous vein grafts were known to be occluded from a prior
catheterization dated [**6-17**] and were therefore not visualized.
3. Graft angiography showed a widely patent LIMA to LAD,
supplying the
distal [**1-18**] of the LAD and large collaterals to the RCA and
r-PDA.
4. Left subclavian angiography showed a widely patent left
subclavian
stent.
5. Resting hemodynamics showed normal left-sided filling
pressure.
6. Left ventriculography showed mild global hypokinesis with
more
pronounced hypokinesis of the inferior wall. There was trace
mitral
regurgitation. The calculated LVEF was 45%.
7. Limited left ilio-femoral peripheral angiography showed a
mild 30%
stenosis of the common femoral artery.

EKG: afib, left axis deviation, ST depression and TWI in V2-V6.

[**12-19**] Echo:

Study continues from Tape [**2149**] W487 to tape [**2149**] W 509, starting
at 0:15 for an additional seven minutes of recording.
LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV cavity size. Suboptimal technical
quality, a focal LV wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
excluded. Depressed LVEF. Cannot assess LVEF.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV not well seen.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR. Mild PA systolic hypertension.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions
1. The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
fully excluded. LV systolic function appears depressed. Overall
left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.
4. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

[**12-26**] cath:
PROCEDURE DATE: [**2149-12-26**]
INDICATIONS FOR CATHETERIZATION:
EKG changes.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Patent LIMA-LAD
COMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right
dominant
system revealed three vessel disease. The LMCA was diffusely
disease.
The LAD was occluded mid-vessel and filled distally via the
LIMA. The
LCX was occluded proximally, and filled distally from
collaterals from
the LCX. The RCA was occluded proximally and filled distally via
bridging collaterals.
2. Graft angiography revealed a patent LIMA-LAD. The SVGs were
not
imaged as they were known to be occluded.
3. Left ventriculography was not performed.
4. The left subclavian stent was widely patent.

LIVER OR GALLBLADDER ULTRASOUND.

INDICATION: 74 year old female with abdominal pain, increased
LFTs. Evaluate
for gallstones, or liver disease.

There are no prior studies for comparison.

The patient is status post cholecystectomy. The common bile duct
measures 5
mm, and is within normal limits status post cholecystectomy. The
liver shows
no focal abnormalities. The liver parenchyma is mildly
hyperechoic in
echotexture, consist
