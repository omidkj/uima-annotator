Admission Chest AP:
Allowing for technique, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
likely normal. Patchy opacity is seen in the left lower
lobe/lingular area. The right lung appears clear. There is
slight biapical pleural thickening. Pulmonary vasculature is
normal. Several calcified nodes are seen in the left hilum. In
addition, there appears to be a calcified granuloma in the right
upper lobe. There may be a small left pleural effusion. The
osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:

1. Left lower lobe/lingular patchy consolidation.
2. Calcified nodes/granuloma suggestive of past granulomatous
infection.
EKG NSR 78bpm, nl axis, no ST or T wave changes

[**2140-12-2**]: Chest AP
The heart is enlarged but stable. The aorta is tortuous. There
are calcified lymph nodes in the AP window and left hilum and
there are calcified granulomas in the left mid and right upper
lung zones. These findings, as well as an area of right apical
thickening are stable. The lungs demonstrate no focal areas of
consolidation. No definite pleural effusions are identified on
the single projection.

As compared to the recent study, there is improved visualization
of the left retrocardiac area.


Brief Hospital Course:
77 yo F with dementia, CHF? who presentedunresponsive at psych
facility with hypercarbic respiratory failure.
*
1) Respiratory Failure- We thought that her respiratory failure
was multifactorial in etiology. The patient is perhaps
hypercarbic at baseline. Pt likely hyper carbic at base line.
We thought that pnemonia exacerbated her possible COPD/OSA/
obesity hypoventilation to the point where she decompensated.
We also found that a pannus in the upper cervical spine which
might have contributed to the patient's apnea. (see neuro
below).  The patient was transferred to the MICU where she was
intubated then  weaned to pressure support and then successfully
extubated on [**11-23**].  She was then weaned off oxygen onto room
air.
*
2)Pneumonia exaceCeftriaxone/azith were started on admission
which was eventually changed to levofloxacin such that she
completed a 10 day course.
*
3)Obstructive sleep apnea: She continued to desaturate
periodically at night for which she was started on bipap with
good effect but the patient refused to wear the bipap mask.  She
also underwent an inpatient sleep study but this was terminated
early secondary to her refusal to wear the bipap mask.  (An
interpreter was present.)
*
4)Psych - Pt was originally started on her home psych meds (see
meds on admission).  However zyprexa and depakote were stopped
due to possible respiratory depression.  Psychiatry was
consulted and they thought that the patient had dementia and
resolving delerium.  Her standing haldol was discontinued and
she was started on zyprexa prn agitation.
*
5) Neuro - CT of the head demonstrated basal ganlia lesion and a
pannus in the upper cervical spine.  MRI done to further
evaluate which demonstrated: a Posterior vertebral pannus
formation C1-C2, with compression/stenosis of the spinal cord as
it exits the foramen magnum. There was no evidence of
intracranial hemorrhage, or minor or major vascular territorial
infarction. Chronic lacunar infarcts were also observed
Neurosurg consulted.  The spoke to the pts home neurosurgeon at
[**Hospital 189**] Hospital and found that this was a problem that had
already been worked up.  Because of her poor baseline functional
status the pt was felt to be a poor surgical candidate.  She was
placed in a cervical collar which she refused to wear.
*
6)In light of the continued improvement in her mental status we
(the medical team and the patient's family) thought that it
would be best if the patient were transferred to a rehab/long
term care center where she could prepare for the upcoming
surgery should her family decide to procede. At this time the
family deferred surgery in light of her condition.
