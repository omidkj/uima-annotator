HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 45 year old female
patient with a history of bipolar disease and idiopathic
tachycardia who was transferred to [**Hospital6 649**] from [**Hospital6 19155**] where she
presented with left lower quadrant and left flank pain,
nausea and thrombocytopenia.  The patient initially presented
to the outside hospital with a three day history of [**Location (un) 2452**]
urine and loose [**Location (un) 2452**] stools with a more recent development
of a lower extremity rash.  In addition, the patient noted
fatigue with increasing dyspnea on exertion over the last
three to six weeks.  She also endorsed a one day history of
nausea with a development of crampy searing left lower
quadrant and flank pain associated with [**Location (un) 2452**] loose stools.
The patient denied any fever, chills, nightsweats, upper
respiratory tract symptoms, sore throat.  She also denied any
epistaxis or bleeding gums.  The patient similarly denied any
new medications or changes in her medications.

At the outside hospital, the patient's laboratory data was
notable for a platelet count of 7, INR 1.2, and large blood
on a urinalysis.  An abdominal computerized tomography scan
was performed which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis, no
renal stones and a cyst in the right kidney.  The patient was
given 1 gm intravenously of Solu-Medrol and was transferred
to [**Hospital6 256**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  Heme - The patient was transferred to
[**Hospital6 256**] from an outside hospital
with a platelet count of 7 there and 13 on admission here.
She was admitted to the General Medicine Service with a
diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.  A
hematology and transfusion medicine consult was obtained and
the patient was initiated on plasmapheresis for idiopathic
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.  The patient had stool
cultures sent which were negative for Escherichia coli and
Shigella.  Her heme studies were consistent with a hemolytic
anemia in addition to her thrombocytopenia.  The patient
underwent five cycles of plasmapheresis which were
uncomplicated and her platelet count eventually increased to
244.  During the patient's sixth plasmapheresis she
experienced hives on her face and upper chest which were
treated with Benadryl and steroids.  On the following day,
during her seventh plasmapheresis the patient was
premedicated with Benadryl and Tylenol.  The first 45 minutes
of the patient's pheresis were uneventful but the patient
subsequently began to cough continuously and became acutely
short of breath.  The patient was given an additional
intravenous dose of Benadryl and 200 mg of Hydrocortisone and
was noted to have an oxygen saturation of 87% on room air.
The patient was placed on 5 liters of nonrebreather and her
oxygen saturations increased only to 93%.  Respiratory
therapy was called and gave the patient a Combivent nebulizer
treatment and the patient began coughing up pink frothy
sputum.  A Code Blue was called and the patient became more
uncomfortable appearing with expiratory grunting and
paradoxical movements.

The patient was urgently transported to the Emergency
Department where she was intubated for respiratory failure.
While in the MICU the patient was continued on plasmapheresis
per the recommendations of the transfusion medicine consult
service and the hematology consult service.  The patient's
platelet count remained relatively stable for several days in
the MICU and the hematology service recommended Rituximib
which the patient received on [**2120-3-27**].  The patient's
platelet count subsequently increased with subsequent
plasmapheresis.  In addition, her other markers of hemolytic
anemia including LDH, total bilirubin and haptoglobin
improved.

2.  Respiratory failure - As noted earlier, the patient
became acutely short of breath with expiratory grunting and
paradoxical breathing patterns during her seventh
plasmapheresis and was urgently transferred to the Emergency
Department where she was intubated.  The etiology of the
patient's respiratory failure was considered likely secondary
to Trali with adult respiratory distress syndrome.  The
patient was initiated on pressure control ventilation with
several recruitment maneuvers and was paralyzed due to
continuous difficulty oxygenating and ventilating.  Over her
stay in the MICU the patient's oxygenation and ventilation
improved and she was eventually switched over to assist
control ventilation which she tolerated quite well.  Over her
MICU course, the patient's driving pressures and positive
end-expiratory pressure as well as her FIO2 were titrated
down.  The patient was continued on unprotected ventilation
for adult respiratory distress syndrome.  With large volume
diuresis with CVVH the patient's respiratory status improved
dramatically and at the time of dictation, the patient is
tolerating pressure support, ventilation of [**5-1**] and
oxygenating quite well.

3.  Septic shock - The patient was noted on transfer to the
MICU to be in septic shock requiring pressors and large fluid
boluses.  The etiology of the patient's septic shock is not
entirely clear at this time but is considered likely
secondary to her transfusion-related acute lung injury
associated with a massive cytokine release.  The patient was
placed on Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin, Flagyl and Levofloxacin
for broad empiric coverage.  She had blood, urine and sputum
cultures which are all negative to date.  She received a even
day course of steroids for relative adrenal insufficiency.
The patient was noted to have an elevated lactate on
admission to the MICU likely secondary to hypoperfusion of
tissues.  Her lactate level and metabolic acidosis improved
through her extended stay in the MICU and she had an
improving white blood cell count with increased bandemia.
Once stable, the p
