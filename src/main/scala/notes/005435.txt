Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, chest pain

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Cardiac Catheterization
Intubation/Extubation


History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year old female with a history of
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and diastolic congestive
heart failure who presented to [**Location (un) 745**] [**Hospital 20468**] Hospital on
[**2133-4-23**] with worsening shortness of breath.  According the her
family the patient had increasing lower extremity edema for one
week and one day of heavy breathing at rest.  Her dyspnea was
not relieved by her albuterol inhaler.  On the afternoon of
admission she experienced dull substernal chest pain without
radiation, initially [**2-16**] but increasing to [**7-19**], that lasted
for 4-6 hours, for which she called EMS.
.
She presented to the [**Location (un) 745**]-[**Location (un) 3678**] ED, where her initial
vitals signs were notable for a blood pressure of 220/80 in the
setting of respiratory distress.  She was treated with Combivent
nebulziers, Solumedrol 125 mg IV x1, Lasix 40 mg IV, aspirin,
nitropaste and sublingual nitroglyerin with improvement in her
symptoms.  She was initially on a nitro gtt. Her EKG showed NSR
at 62 with no obvious evidence of ischemia. Her troponins came
back elevated and she was started on a heparin and nitro drips
and transferred to the ICU. She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for
cardiac catheterization.
.
On review of systems she currently denies fevers, chills,
lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath,
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysuria, hematuria, diarrhea,
constipation.  She has chronic leg swelling which is much
improved from her hospitalization here in [**Month (only) **].  She has two
pillow orthopnea which has not worsened.  She denies paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea.  All other review of systems negative in
detail.

Past Medical History:
Diastolic Heart Failure
h/o bradycardia
Hyperlipidemia
Hypothyroidism
Hypertension
Type II Diabetes
GERD
s/p CVA in [**2128**]
Osteoarthritis
Stage 3 Chronic Kidney Disease
s/p cholecystectomy

Social History:
She is mostly Spanish-speaking and originally from [**Male First Name (un) 1056**].
She has several children. She quit smoking 15 years ago with a
20 pack year smoking history. Denies alcohol or illicit drug
use.

Family History:
The family history is significant for coronary artery disease in

both her mother and father who died from acute myocardial
infarctions. Her mother died at age 76 and her father died at
the age of 59. The patient has three male siblings, two of whom
have died from complications of acute myocardial infarction. One
of them apparently had significant liver disease of unknown
etiology. The patient has female siblings and one of them has
diabetes.

Pertinent Results:
IMAGING:
ECG ([**4-24**]): Sinus arrhythmia at a rate of 64, Borderline first
degree A-V block with PR 204, Vertical axis, Long QTc interval
at 489, Late R wave progression, Possible anterior infarct - age
undetermined, ST-T changes may be due to myocardial
ischemia/myocardial infarction/ central nervous system
event/metabolic derangemant
.
ECG ([**4-26**]): Irregular sinus bradycardia at a rate of 57, First
degree A-V block with PR 290, Vertical axis, Possible anterior
infarct - age undetermined, ST-T changes may be due to
myocardial ischemia/ myocardial infarction/central nervous
system event metabolic derangement
.
TTE ([**4-27**]):
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. The right atrial pressure is
indeterminate. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 55-60%). The
apex is not well seen. The remaining LV segments all appear to
contract normally. There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a very small
pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-10-9**], no
change.
.
Cardiac Catheterization ([**4-27**]): COMMENTS:
1. Coronary angiography in this right dominant system
demonstrated an LMCA with mild plaquing to 30% at the origin and
the bifurcation; the LMCA was heavily calcified and demonstrated
40-mmHg pressure damping when engaged with JL4 and JL3.5
catheters. The LAD was heavily calcified and diffusely diseased
throughout with abrupt tapering to 50% after D1 at a large S1;
there is diffuse disease to 70% in the mid-LAD and diffuse
disease in the distal LAD; the large D1 had proximal 50% tubular
disease; by QCA the "anuerysmal" mid-LAD was 2.6 mm diameter,
with MLD 1.08 and proximal reference 2-mm after S1. The LCX was
heavily calcified with luminal irregularities and 40% origin
disease; there was a large OM3 and LPL/OM4. There was a small
ramus. The RCA had diffuse disease with up to 50% disease
proximally and 50% narrowing in the proximal RPDA.
2. Abdominal aortography showed a small, tapering distal
abdominal aorta with diffuse atherosclerosis and calcification.
There was moderate 40-50% right renal artery stenosis and mild
plaquing in the left renal artery.
3. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed severe systemic
arterial hypertension, severe LV diastolic dysfunction and
moderate-severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.
4. ECG monitoring showed intermittent bradycardia with blocked
PACs and occasional junctional rhythm with apparent retrograde P
waves.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Two vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.
3. Mild-moderate right and left renal artery stenosis.
4. Moderate-severe pulmonary arterial hypertension and severe
systemic arterial hypertension.

CXR Portable ([**4-28**]): FINDINGS: On today's radiograph, the
cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged. There is retrocardiac
atelectasis. Interstitial markings, a dilated azygos vein and
small pleural effusions as well as the bronchial cuffing all
indicate the presence of moderate pulmonary edema. There is no
focal parenchymal opacity suggestive of pneumonia.
.
CXR Portable ([**4-28**]): SINGLE AP semi-upright radiograph at 10:00
a.m. bedside: There has been interval placement of an ET tube
terminating 3.7 cm above the carina. No other short-term
interval changes with unchanged moderate pulmonary edema, and
bilateral pleural effusion.
.
CXR Portable ([**4-29**]): There are small bilateral pleural
effusions. Evaluation of the pulmonary parenchyma is limited due
to soft tissue scatter. Persistant moderate pulmonry edema is
noted. There is a dense retrocardiac opacity, possibly reflects
atelectasis. Stable moderate cardiomegaly is noted. ET tube is
in standard location. NG tube is extending
