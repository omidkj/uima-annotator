HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old female
with a past medical history of hypertension, vascular
disease, increased cholesterol, laryngeal carcinoma 10 years
ago, status post laryngectomy, cervical carcinoma status post
TAH, angina and appendectomy, who presented to [**Hospital1 346**] Emergency Room on [**2108-8-4**].  She was
transferred from [**Hospital 8**] Hospital.  This whole issue
started on [**2108-7-20**] when patient presented to [**Hospital 8**]
Hospital for an ischemic right fifth toe.  The patient had at
that time bilateral iliac stenting.  She left the procedure
with suprapubic hematoma.  She received three units of packed
red blood cells and 6 units of platelets and she was
discharged home on [**7-30**].  The patient was noted to be
lethargic over the subsequent days and returned to [**Hospital 8**]
Hospital on [**8-2**].  When she got to [**Hospital 8**] Hospital she was
anemic with hematocrit of 24 and thrombocytopenic with a
platelet count of 25,000.  She received two units of packed
red blood cells and 6 units of platelets and she continued to
have low counts.  Hematology was consulted at that point and
LDH was increased.  The patient was transferred t [**Hospital1 346**] on [**8-4**] for further management of a
presumed TTP.  On [**8-4**] she complained of left hand numbness,
paresthesias and a left sided facial droop that lasted 15
minutes, which resolved on its own.  Neuro consult felt TIA
was the most likely cause with right MCA territory.  CAT scan
of the head was negative.  MRI and MRA demonstrated
atherosclerotic changes of intracranial carotids, right
greater than left, but no stroke.

Mrs. [**Known lastname 32495**] began plasmapheresis on [**8-5**], though during her
first episode she developed hypotension with systolic blood
pressure to the 80's, responded to fluid boluses and she was
also hypocalcemic at the time.  Therefore, patient was
transmitted to the MICU where plasmapheresis continued there.
On [**8-10**] she completed a course of plasmapheresis, her
platelets had maxed at 238,000 and her LDH was 271.  She
needed plasmapheresis again on [**8-12**] for decreasing platelets,
increasing LDH and decreasing haptoglobin.  Subsequently on
[**8-12**] she developed a fever to 101.  She was cultured and
blood cultures grew coag negative staph aureus four bottles
and the patient was started on Vancomycin.  She had a line
exchange on [**8-17**].  During that time her platelet count was
decreasing and there was a question of infection vs DIC and
HIT.  She had an HIT positive antibody at that time.
Plasmapheresis continued through the right subclavian
catheter placed by IR with completion of plasmapheresis on
the [**9-6**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She had temperature 98.9, blood
pressure 150/70, pulse 85, respirations 20, 95% on room air.
She was in no apparent distress.  She was normocephalic,
atraumatic, equal ocular movements intact.  Chest clear to
auscultation.  Cardiovascular showed a regular rate and
rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.
Abdomen was benign.  Extremities, no clubbing, cyanosis or
edema but there was a large ecchymoses in the right groin
area.  Neuro, she is alert and oriented times three, cranial
nerves II through XII grossly intact, muscle strength 5/5
throughout.  Back without tenderness.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As previously noted.  She has
hypertension, vascular disease, increased cholesterol,
laryngeal carcinoma 10 years ago, status post laryngectomy,
cervical cancer status post total abdominal hysterectomy,
angina status post epi.

MEDICATIONS:  On admission, Meclizine 25 mg once a day,
Atenolol 50 mg once a day, iron 325 mg tid and Lipitor 10 mg
once a day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

LABORATORY DATA:  She had a white count of 8.3, hematocrit
29.9, platelet count 35, PT 13.6, PTT 26 and INR 1.1, d dimer
greater than 1,000, FTP between 10 and 40, SMA 10 was within
normal limits.  Head CT on the [**8-3**] was negative.  Head CT on
[**8-4**] showed no acute blood.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Partially stated during HPI, patient was
admitted on [**8-4**] to [**Hospital1 69**] from
[**Hospital 8**] Hospital.  The patient had a hematocrit of 29.9 and
platelet count 35 and white appeared to be a TIA, so it was
believed that patient was suffering from TTP.  The patient
developed a plasmapheresis on [**8-5**] at which point she became
hypotensive with systolic blood pressure to the 80's and
hypocalcemia.  Therefore, patient was transferred to the MICU
where she tolerated plasmapheresis very well.  The patient's
platelets came up to 238,000, LDH came down to 271 on [**8-12**],
though it was noted that the patient's platelets were
decreasing again.  LDH was rising and haptoglobin was low.
The patient restarted plasmapheresis on [**8-12**].  On subsequent
exam on [**8-12**], the patient developed a fever to 101.5 with
coag negative staph in [**4-26**] bottles from the blood.  She was
started on Vancomycin and her line was exchanged on [**8-17**].
When patient had a fever on [**8-12**] and the line needed
exchanging, the patient was sent to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] on the [**Hospital Ward Name 8559**].  The patient received right subclavian and continued
on Vancomycin for one week.  A new line was placed on [**8-17**].
During that time there was question of infection and DIC vs
HIT.  The patient had HIT positive lab test results.  Patient
had good renal function throughout the whole hospitalization.
Creatinine ranged from 0.9 to 1.1.  Some time on the floor
the patient had one episode of chest tightness that resolved
with Nitroglycerin.  Cardiology consult believed this to be
demand ischemia with minor ST-T changes.  Troponin maxed at
1.7 and patient was treated with increased beta blockers.  At
that time patient was not a candidate for Aspirin therapy.
The patient completed plasmapheresis on [**9-6**] for a total of
25 sessions of plasmapheresis.  Upon discharge the patient's
platelets normalized at 298,000, LDH remained within the
normal limits.  The patient was discharged home with home
services.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Patient is stable at discharge.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Calcitrol 0.25 mcg q day, Insulin
sliding scale, Prednisone taper, Atenolol 100 mg q day,
Protonix q 40 mg q day, Meclizine 12.5 mg q day, Folic Acid 1
mg q day, Iron 325 mg q day and Alendronate 5 mg q day.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  TTP.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.  Home with services.
