Service: CARDIOTHORACIC

Allergies:
Penicillins / Zantac / Bactrim

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 922**]
Chief Complaint:
Admitted for elective cardiac surgery

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2182-4-22**] Two vessel coronary artery bypass grafting(vein grafts
to diagonal and posterior descending artery), Aortic Valve
Replacement(23 millimeter pericardial Magna with Thermafix), and
Replacement of Ascending Aorta and Hemiarch(30 millimeter
Gelweave Graft).


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 74 year old male with known CAD and AS/bicuspid
valve. He has a history of a positive stress test and recently
underwent cardiac catheterization which showed right dominant
coronary circulation with a 70% stenosis in the diagonal artery
with 90% lesion in the mid right coronary artery. Left
ventriculography revealed a preserved ejection fraction and
very calcified aortic valve with reduced mobility. There was
severe aortic stenosis with aortic valve gradient of 57 mmHg and
valve area of 0.6 cm2. A recent chest CT scanz([**2182-4-19**]) found
dilatation of the ascending thoracic aorta. The aorta measured
4.4 x 4.9 cm at the level of the sinus of Valsalva. The aorta
returned to [**Location 213**] caliber at the location of the ligamentum
arteriosum. Outside ECHO in [**2182-2-10**] showed [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 0.8
cm2 with a mean gradient of 43 mmHg. Based upon the above
results, he was admitted for cardiac surgical intervention. Of
note, the CT scan in [**2182-4-10**] was also notable for a focal
abdominal aortic dissection at the level of the renal arteries
extending over approximately 3.5 cm. All the mesenteric vessels
and the renal
arteries originate from the true lumen. There is no
extravasation of contrast
from the aorta.


Past Medical History:
Coronary artery disease, Bicuspid Aortic Valve, Aortic Stenosis,
Ascending Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal Aortic Dissection,
Hypertension, Elevated cholesterol, BPH, History of C. diff, s/p
Right TKR, s/p PTCA of RCA


Social History:
Widowed, lives alone. 20 pack year history of tobacco, quit 20
years ago. Denies ETOH. He has 3 children.

Family History:
Denies premature CAD.

Physical Exam:
Vitals: BP 130/69, HR 67, RR 22, SAT  97% on room air
General: well developed male in no acute distress
HEENT: oropharynx benign, edentulous, MMM, PERRL
Neck: supple, no JVD, transmitted murmur vs bruit noted
bilaterally
Heart: regular rate, normal s1s2, harsh SEM noted
Lungs: clear bilaterally
Abdomen: soft, nontender, normoactive bowel sounds
Ext: warm, no edema, no varicosities
Pulses: 2+ distally
Neuro: nonfocal


Pertinent Results:
[**2182-4-17**] Carotid Ultrasound: Minimal plaque with bilateral less
than 40% carotid stenosis.

[**2182-4-19**] Chest, Abd, Pelvic CT Scan: 1. Focal abdominal aortic
dissection at the level of the renal arteries extending over
approximately 3.5 cm. All the mesenteric vessels and the renal
arteries originate from the true lumen. There is no
extravasation of contrast from the aorta. 2. Ascending aortic
aneurysm. The abnormal dilatation begins at the level of the
sinus of Valsalva and extends to the ligamentum arteriosum.
There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm.

[**2182-4-11**] Cardiac Cath: 1.Selective coronary angiography revealed a
right dominant system with one vessel coronary artery disease.
LMCA was free of angiographically apparent disease, LAD had
minimal disease except for a 70% origin of a small D2 branch.
LCX was without obstructive disease. The RCA had a 90%
mid-vessel lesion. 2. Left ventriculography revealed a preserved
ejection fraction and very calcified aortic valve with reduced
mobility. 3. Hemodynamic assessment showed mildly elevated right
sided filling pressures and normal left sided filling pressures
with mild pulmonary hypertension. There was severe aortic
stenosis with Ao valve gradient of 57 mmHg and valve area of 0.6
cm2. There was no mitral stenosis.

Brief Hospital Course:
On the day of admission, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**] performed coronary artery
bypass grafting along with an aortic valve replacment and
replacement of his acending aorta and hemiarch. The operation
was uneventful and he was transferred to the CSRU for invasive
monitoring. Within 24 hours, he awoke neurologically intact and
was extubated. He maintained stable hemodynamics as he weaned
from inotropic support. His CSRU course was uncomplicated and he
transferred to the SDU on postoperative day one. He remained in
a normal sinus rhythm and tolerated beta blockade. All chest
tubes were gradually removed without complication. Over several
days, medical therapy was optimized and he continued to make
clinical improvements with diuresis. The rest of his
postoperative course was routine and he was medically cleared
for discharge on postoperative day four. At discharge, his BP
was 120-130/60-70 with a HR of 80. His oxygen saturation was 95%
on room air and the discharge chest x-ray showed only small
bilateral pleural effusions with associated bibasilar
atelectasis. All surgical wounds were clean, dry and intact.
