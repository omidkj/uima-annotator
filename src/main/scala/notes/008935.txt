History of Present Illness:
65 year old male without medical history presenting for
evaluation of shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting. He is
visiting his mother and lives in [**Name (NI) 2848**] normally. He has been in
[**Location (un) 86**] for about 10 days.  5-6 days prior to admission he
developed paroxysmal cough. He obtained tessalon perles and an
antibiotic from a local allergist. He did not fill the
antibiotic.  His cough was intermittently productive.  Over the
weekend, he developed prominent GI symptoms with persistent
nausea, forced dry heaves/wretching and some vomiting. He was
coughing and vomiting up [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 2452**]-frothy liquid.  He noted
shortness of breath and came to the ED for evaluation on [**7-21**].
CXR demonstrated right upper lobe pneumonia with left lower lobe
nodular density and he was discharged on levofloxacin, albuterol
and prednisone 50 mg daily X 4 days.

He went home and took the medication on the day of admission.
His GI symptoms progressed and he had frequent
vomiting/wretching with some hematemesis. He continued to have a
wet cough productive of [**Location (un) 2452**] sputum.  He came to the ED for
evaluation.

In the ED, initial vitals were: 102.4 119 206/136 42 89% RA.  He
was placed on a NRB and maintained O2 sat 94-96% but would
desaturate to low 80s on room air.  Imaging demonstrated
bilateral infiltrates, markedly progressed from [**2143-7-21**]. He was
treated with vancomycin, zosyn, acetaminophen, zofran,
albuterol, compazine, and guaifenasin with codeine.

Upon arrival to the floor, he was sitting up in bed, reporting
shortness of breath and need to urinate. He was unable to speak
