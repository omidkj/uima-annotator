History of Present Illness:
77 yo F with h/o schizophrenia, recent CHF, HTN, CAD s/p
medically managed MI 3 wks ago when she presented to [**Hospital1 336**] and
she was supposed to go to cath but declined as she said they
"didn't explain things" to her and she was sent out with medical
therapy. Over the last week she has become progressively more
SOB with PND, orthopnea, dyspnea at rest and on exertion and
chest tightness.  She went to [**Hospital3 4107**] on [**2125-7-4**] because
of her worsening symptoms where her ECG showed LVH with strain
pattern, CXR with pulmonary edema, echo w/ ef 40-45 % and AS w/
[**Location (un) 109**] 0.9 am, grad 25/12, BNP >5,000, flat CKs and trop 0.5. She
was monitored in the ICU and started on ASA, plavix, nitro gtt,
lovenox, statin and IV lopressor.  She was also found to have a
UTI and was treated with levofloxacin and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]
for ASA desensitization and cath.

[**2125-7-6**] EKG:

[**2125-7-6**] Cardiac cath: 1. Selective coronary angiography in this
right dominant
circulation demonstrated severe three vessel and left main
coronary
artery disease. The LMCA had a calcified 80% stenosis present.
The
proximal and mid LAD had diffuse disease with the mid LAD having
a
complex 80% stenosis at the takeoff of the D1 followed by a 100%
mid-LAD
stenosis. The distal LAD filled via left to left collaterals.
The D1 had
diffuse disease and supplied collaterals to the distal LAD. The
LCX had
a 90% proximal stenosis in the major OM1. The OM2 was a small
vessel.
The RCA was a dominant vessel with diffuse disease in the
proximal and
mid vessel. A 99% complex stenosis was seen in the mid RCA. The
distal
RCA was supplied by left to right collaterals.
2. Right and left heart catheterization demonstrated severely
elevated
right and left sided filling pressures RVEDP=19mmHg, mean
PWCP=42mmHg
and LVEDP=38mmHg. There was severe pulmonary hypertension
(82/36). There
was moderate systemic arterial hypertension (165/88). Cardiac
output and
index were severely depressed at 2.7 L/min and 1.7 L/min/m2
respectively. Mild aortic stenosis was seen with mean gradient
of
~15mmHg and calculated [**Location (un) 109**] of 1.4cm2. A mean mitral stenosis
gradient of
~12mmHg was seen but is likely artifactual since a true PCWP
tracing was unable to be obtained after multiple attempts as
evidenced
by low PWCP saturations (~66%).
3. No left ventriculogram was performed due to elevated left
sided
filling pressures.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Severe three vessel and left main coronary artery disease.
2. Mild aortic stenosis.
3. Severe biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
4. Severely depressed cardiac output and cardiac index.
5. Severe pulmonary hypertension.

[**2125-7-6**] Echocardiogram: 1. The left atrium is moderately dilated.

2.There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.
There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular
systolic
function is severely depressed. [Intrinsic left ventricular
systolic function
may be more depressed given the severity of valvular
regurgitation.] Resting
regional wall motion abnormalities include severe global
hypokinesis with more
marked inferior and mid and distal septal hypokinesis.
3.There is mild global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.

4.The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
minimal aortic
valve stenosis. Mild to moderate ([**12-3**]+) aortic regurgitation is
seen.
5.The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe mitral
annular calcification. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
8. There is an echogenic density in the right atrium and
ventricle consistent
with a Swan -Ganz catheter.

[**2125-7-7**]
 CXR:Moderate congestive heart failure with moderate-to-large
bilateral pleural effusions
[**2125-7-9**]
CXR: There is marked decrease in the pulmonary edema. There is a
moderate right-sided pleural effusion and a small left-sided
pleural effusion. There is mild cardiomegaly.

COMMENTS:
1. Selective coronary angiography of the left coronary
circulation
revealed severe diffuse disease in heavily calcified vessels.
The LMCA
had a distal 80% stenosis at an area of severe focal
calcification. The
LAD was totally occluded in its mid segment after giving off a
large D1.
The mid LAD had an 80% stenosis at another area of severe focal
calcification. The LCX was a small diffusely diseased,
nondominant
vessel. There was a large, tortuous, heavily calcified ramus
which had a
focal 99% proximal stenosis.
2. A 7 French 30 cc intraaortic balloon pump was inserted
prophylactically via the LFA through an 8 French sheath with
good
augmentation and unloading with conterpulsation.
3. Successful rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the
mid LAD
into D1 with overlapping 3.5 x 23 and 3.5 x 8 mm Cypher DES,
with the
proximal stent being postdilated with a 3.75 mm balloon in its
mid LAD
segment. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the
stented
segment of the LAD into D1, no apparent dissection, and normal
flow (see
PTCA comments).
4. Successful rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the
ramus
with a 3.0 x 13 mm Cypher DES which was postdilated with a 3.5
mm
balloon. Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis in the
stented
segment, no apparent dissection, and normal flow (see PTCA
comments).
5. Successful rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the
LMCA with
a 3.5 x 13 mm Cypher DES which was postdilated with a 3.75 mm
balloon.
Final angiography revealed no residual stenosis, no apparent
dissection,
and normal flow (see PTCA comments).
6. Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures (mRAP 8
