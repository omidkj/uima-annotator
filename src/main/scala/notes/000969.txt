Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7651**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath, Pericardial Effusion

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Pericardiocentesis with drain placement
Removal of pacemaker


History of Present Illness:
75-year-old female with a past medical history of CHF, afib,
COPD, HTN pacer placement approximately 7 days prior on Coumadin
who presented to an outside hospital with worsening SOB since
yesterday morning with exertion.  As per patient's HCP, since
being discharged from the hospital pt was doing well and
developed dyspnea after breakfast yesterday morning.  An echo
showed a moderate-large pericardial effusion with possible RV
diastolic collapse, INR was 4, she was given 5 VitK, and sent to
[**Hospital1 18**] for further eval.  At [**Hospital1 18**], initial vitals were 98.0 63
129/63 18 99% 2L Nasal Cannula.  Bedside TTE showed a moderate
pericardial effusion with some RV/RA diastolic collapse.  Pulsus
[**10-19**] with JVP 10.  INR was 6.9, BNP 5705, Trop .62.  She was
given 2 units FFP, 5 VitK, and admitted to the CCU.  On
transfer, vitals 98.2 57 115/62 18 100% on 3L.
.
On transfer to the floor, the patient was found to been in
respiratory distress, with stridorous breath sounds throughout
lungs fields; had hives on back, as well as chest.  Patient was
tachypneic, with labored respirations. Given IV epinephrine
followed by subQ doses, solumedrol IV push, famotidine,
diphenhydramine and taken to cath lab for intubation and
pericardial drainage.
.
Cath Lab Course: Pt taken to cath lab, intubated without
complications, and found to have perforation of RV by pacer lead
which was found to be within the pericardial space. Pericardial
drain placed with drainage of ~350cc's of bloody fluid.

ECHO [**2163-11-7**]
The left atrium is elongated. The estimated right atrial
pressure is 5-10 mmHg. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). with
normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve is not well
seen. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is
seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion. The effusion
appears circumferential. The effusion is echo dense, consistent
with blood, inflammation or other cellular elements. No right
ventricular diastolic collapse is seen.

IMPRESSION: Moderate pericardial effusion. Elevated
intrapericardial pressure without overt tamponade.
.
ECHO [**2163-11-9**]
FOCUSED STUDY FOR PERICARDIAL EFFUSION: The left atrium is
dilated. The right atrium is dilated. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular cavity is
dilated with depressed free wall contractility. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate to severe [3+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is a small pericardial effusion. The
effusion is echo dense, consistent with blood, inflammation or
other cellular elements. There are no echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2163-11-8**],
the pericardial effusion is similar in size.

PERICARDIOCENTESIS [**2163-11-7**]
COMMENTS:
Using the sharp-tip needle, we performed pericardiocentesis via
the
subxyphoid approach. There was inadvertent needle puncture of
the RA, RV
and LA before appropriate needle position was obtained in the
pericardial space. A wire was advanced, the tract was dilated,
and the
pericardial drain was inserted into the pericardial space. 370
cc of
bloody fluid was removed and echocardiography confirmed minimal
residual
effusion. Because of respiratory acidosis, she was intubated at
the
conclusion of the procedure. The pericardial drain was sutured
into
place.
.
EKG [**2163-11-10**]
Atrial fibrillation. Non-specific anterior T wave changes. Low
voltage in the limb leads. There is non-specific T wave
flattening in leads V5-V6. Compared to the previous tracing of
[**2163-11-7**] there is now atrial fibrillation and non-specific T
wave flattening. Clinical correlation is suggested.
.
CXR [**2163-11-9**]
PORTABLE AP CHEST: The endotracheal tube, orogastric tube, and
left chest
wall pacer and associated leads have been removed. A small-bore
catheter
projecting over the heart could represent a pericardial drain.

Cardiac silhouette remains markedly enlarged. There is decreased
vascular
congestion and edema. Moderate right and likely left pleural
effusions
persist. No new opacity concerning for
