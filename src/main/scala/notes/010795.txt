Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 689**]
Chief Complaint:
CC: s/p fall w/ pelvic and wrist fracture transfered to medical
svc. for medical mgt of hyponatremia and concurrent medical
disorders.


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right wrist open reduction and internal fixation on [**2105-2-18**].
Orthopaedic surgeon was Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 1005**] at [**Hospital1 827**].

History of Present Illness:
83 year old with hx of Afib (on coumadin), carotid stenosis,
longstanding difficult to manage HTN on numerous Rx, diastolic
Heart Failure, prior steady gait, who presented on [**2-13**] w/
presumed mechanical fall while getting dressed at home. Injuries
sustained included R superior and inferior pubic rami fracture,
Right acetabular fracture, Right wrist fracture.  Admitted
overnight to trauma SICU for observation, hematocrit and
neurologic monitoring as her INR was supratherapeutic in the
setting of coumadin. On admission, patient had a sodium of 113,
K+ = 2.7, HCO3 29, Cl 73, WBC 19 w/ left shift, INR 3.2, though
noted to be mentating well throughout. CXR was negative for
PNA/CHF, UA+ UCx no growth, Blood Cx no growth. Head CT was
without bleed.  She was managed for hypovolemic hyponatremia,
hypokalemia, hypochloremia w/ held diuretics and slow and
calculated normal saline repletion restoring normal levels while
in the SICU w/ correction of serum sodium to 124 after 24 hours.
Coumadin was initially held for supratherapeutic INR. ICU course
also notable for hemodynamically stability throughout and
transfusion of 1 unit of PRBC.

She was transfered to the medical service.

-HTN (refractory, several recent medication adjustments
 including addition of clonidine patch)
-No hx of stroke, DM, or high cholesterol

Brief Hospital Course:
83 year old with hx of Afib (on coumadin), carotid stenosis,
longstanding recalcitrant HTN on numerous Rx, diastolic Heart
Failure,  prior steady gait, who presented on [**2-13**] w/ presumed
mechanical fall sustaining fractured right pelvis and right
wrist. Course c/b hypovolemic hyponatremia, hypokalemia,
hypochloremia.  Had ORIF right wrist [**2-18**].  No surgical
intervention indicated per ortho on pelvic fracture.

### HYPONATREMIA:
Sodium decline as follows:

         Na
[**11-27**]   140
[**2104-12-29**] 128
[**2105-1-30**]  129
[**2105-2-13**] 113 on this presentation.

Initially Rx'ed for hypovolemic hypotonic hyponatremia felt [**2-25**]
renal losses in the setting of diuretics. Diuretics held during
admission.  Recieved continuous replacement and corrected to
124.  Then, as euvolemic (Urine Osm 352), was free water
restricted (to 1.5L/day) with improved Na to 131 on [**2105-2-19**].
Suspect she is near baseline with regards to sodium and provided
her sodium is stable or continues to trend up, will not need
further free water restriction.  Continue to hold diuretics.  If
further sodium infusions are required at rehab, would monitor
for signs of volume overload given her diastolic heart failure.

### RIGHT HIP FRACTURES: Right inferior pubic ramus and right
acetabular fractures.  No evidence of bowel or solid organ
injury. No surgical intervention indicated.  Physical therapy
consult worked with patient in this regard. Weight bearing as
tolerated on right lower extremity.

### RIGHT WRIST FRACTURE: Impacted distal radius fracture s/p
ORIF ([**2-18**]). Right upper extremity is in a splint at time of
discharge and non-weight bearing.

### POST OPERATIVE PAIN: Has been receiving morphine 1-3mg iv or
oxycodone 5-10mg while being monitor closely for sedation or
altered mental status as she has a history of sensitivity to
narcotics.

### ANEMIA:  Minimal blood loss in OR. HCT trended slightly
[**Last Name (un) 8636**] on [**2-19**], likely secondary to frequent phlebotomy. She
was given one unit PRBC on [**2-19**] which she tole
