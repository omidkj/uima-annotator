MRI [**8-1**]: CONCLUSION: L1 burst fracture with retropulsed
fragment narrowing the spinal canal but no evidence of spinal
cord compression. Smaller fracture of the anterior-inferior
corner of T12.
.
Long TR images signal loss in the intervertebral discs from L2
through L5, a manifestation of degenerative disc disease. At
L2-3, there is a
small bulge with no significant canal narrowing.

At L3-4, a slightly larger bulge produces moderate spinal canal
narrowing with no evidence of cauda equina compression. There
are mild facet osteophytes at this level.

At L4-5, bulging of the intervertebral disc, facet osteophytes,
and ligamentum flavum thickening produce moderate spinal
stenosis. The neural foramina appear normal.

At L5-S1, prominent facet osteophytes extend posterolaterally
and do not
encroach on the spinal canal. There is no abnormality of the
intervertebral disc detected. The neural foramina appear normal.

.
CT [**8-1**]; 1. Comminuted burst fracture of L1 with retropulsed
fragment encroaching on
the spinal canal. Refer to the MR report from earlier today for
details on
spinal cord injury and degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.

2. T12 spinous process non-displaced fracture.
.
[**8-4**] CXR; There are no old films available for comparison. The
heart is
upper limits normal in size. The aorta is mildly tortuous. The
lungs are
clear without infiltrate or effusion. Clips are seen overlying
the lower
neck.
.
CT spine [**8-6**]:IMPRESSION:

1. Unchanged appearance of the L1 burst fracture. Please refer
to the
concurrent MRI report for further detail about its effect on the
thecal sac.
2. Status post posterior fusion from T10 through L4. Anatomic
alignment.
3. Probable small bone island in the T9 vertebral body. If the
patient has a known primary malignancy which may present with
sclerotic metastasis, then a bone scan could be obtained to
exclude a more aggressive lesion.

MRI spine [**8-6**]:
L1 burst fracture again seen. Status post posterior fusion from
T10 through L4. No new abnormalities, aside from the expected
postsurgical
changes.
.
L XR [**8-8**]:
Two views of the lumbar spine from the operating room
demonstrates interval placement of screws within T12 and L2 with
left lateral spinal rod fixating a burst fracture of L1. There
is also subsequent placement of radiolucent disc prostheses at
T12-L1 and L1-L2. Patient has undergone posterior stabilization
with multiple pedicle screws spanning T10 through L4. Please
refer to the procedure note for additional details.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms [**Known lastname 1637**] is a 66yo female HTN/Hyperparathyrodism and
hysteretcomy s/p MVA on [**2137-7-21**] where she was a restrained
passenger, that presents with ongoing abdominal pain, pain with
sitting and walking.  On imaging noted to have L1 vertebral body
burst fracture that was unstable, with kyphotic deformity. A
portion of the vertebral body was retropulsed into the spinal
canal and causing significant stenosis. The conus end just
superior to fracture so there was no cord compression.

She was admitted to neurosurgery service for [**8-1**] for repair.
She underwent a 1. Posterior decompression with laminectomies
T12-L1.  2. Open reduction. 3. Instrumented fusion T10-L4 with
bilateral pedicle screws and 4. ICPG of right iliac crest plus
BMP plus allograft. Postoperatively she did well overall however
was noted to have a L foot drop and L toe extension weakness,
associated with hyperesthesias at RLE up the calf. A f/u MRI
showed a L1 burst fracture s/p posterior fusion from T10 through
L4. There were no new abnormalities, aside from the expected
postsurgical changes.  It was felt that perhaps she while [**Last Name (un) 8433**]
patient over, there was temporary compression of sciatic nerve
vs. deep peroneal. There were no abnormalities in screw
placement that would account for her symptoms/signs.  Over the
next two days, strength in TA improved to 4-/5 and [**3-14**] at [**Last Name (un) 938**].
A CT spine showed similar findings as well as small bone island
of the T9 with concern regarding ? sclerotic metastases as part
of ddx....

On [**8-8**] she underwent anterior fusion of T12 to L2 to stabilize
the posterior fusion. This was an uncomplicated procedure which
she tolerated well.  She resumed PO intake, bowel and bladder
functions were intact.  She underwent PT and will require LSO
until she is seen in follow up.  She was discharged to an
appropriate rehab facility on [**8-14**].
