Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7333**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
1. Rigid bronchoscopy with Dumon black bronchoscope.
2. Flexible bronchoscopy.
3. Balloon dilation of the basilar segments of the left
    lower lobe.
4. Placement of left pleural pigtail catheter.
5. Placement of right pleural pigtail catheter.

History of Present Illness:
69M with a history of CHF/ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 10% 6/09,
ESRD on HD, who presented to OSH with SOB on [**8-8**]. Of note the
patient was recently admitted from [**Date range (1) 83447**] with LUE/LLE edema
and DVT was ruled out however they noted that he had a L sided
pleural effusion and ? infiltrates so he was started on vanc and
ceftaz for hospital acquired pna. He was d/c'ed on 5L of oxygen
and when the VNA visited him he was still SOB on 4L of oxygen
with cough and clear sputum production so he was taken to the ED
and re-admitted. At the OSH, a CT chest showed increase in the L
pleural effusion, collapse of the L lung with obstruction of the
L main stem bronchus, questionable endobronchial lesion vs
mucous plug. He also had a R pleural effusion, ascites, anasarca
and a L ventricular aneurysm. He was hemodialized 2.5L and a
thoracentesis was performed removing 1L of pleural fluid which
was negative for microorganisms. A bronchoscopy was performed
showing a L main stem mucous plug, abnormal endobronchial mucosa
with external compression that was so severe they were unable to
safely advance the bronchoscope. They believed it was secondary
to the LV aneurysm compressing the LMSB. A BAL was performed
showing oropharyngial flora and biopsies of the abnormal mucosa
were sent to pathology. LUE doppler was again repeated due to
persistent LUE edema which was negative. VQ scan was low
probability for PE. The patient was transfered to [**Hospital1 **] for stent
placement.
.
On [**8-13**], he had rigid bronchoscopy with IP.  Following the
procedure he became hypotensive and was started on Levo and Epi
gtt.  On bronchoscopy there was no endobronchial lesion seen
however he did have extrinsic compression of LLL segments.
Balloon dilation was performed, and left chest tube placed which
drained ~2.5L.  Post procedure he remained intubated and on
pressors and was admitted to the TSICU, where a right chest tube
was placed while drained 1.5L. His ICU course has been
complicated by inability to wean pressor support.
.
He was started on Vancomycin and Zosyn given development of
fevers [**8-13**] with plan for 8 day course per IP.  He was extubated
on [**8-15**] and has been on NC since then.  He continues to put out
approximately 1 L of pleural fluid from the left pigtail
catheter.  On the morning prior to transfer to the CCU he pulled
out his aline and the TSICU team was unable to replace despite
multiple attempts.  His blood pressure cuff and Aline were
correlating.  He has continued on max dose epinephrine since IP
procedure and has required levophed intermittently during CVVH.

.
On arrival to the CCU, he appears comfortable and denies pain.
He continues to have dyspnea but endorses improvement since
stenting by IP.

CT chest [**2179-8-13**]:
1. Complete atelectasis of the left lung with a low-density
material within the left main bronchus that may represent
secretions although correlation with bronchoscopy is
recommended. Severe cardiomegaly with left ventricular
enlargement and left ventricular calcification also contribute
to the atelectasis of the lung.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions, large.
3. Extensive coronary calcifications.
4. Evidence of prior granulomatous exposure. Splenic hypodense
wedge-shaped area that might represent infarcts.
5. Anasarca. Ascites. Asymmetric thickening of the left breast
tissue that
might represent hematoma versus extensive edema due to patient
positioning.

CXR [**2179-8-13**]:
FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, one chest tube
has been
inserted into each pleural space. Both tubes show normal
position. The right pleural space has completely cleared, in the
left pleural space moderate remnant pleural effusion is seen.
Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged. Unchanged monitoring and
support devices. Unchanged cardiomegaly. No newly occurred focal
parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. No evidence of
pneumothorax.
.
ECHO [**2179-8-17**]:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely
dilated. There is severe global left ventricular hypokinesis
(LVEF = 10%). A large (2.6 x 2.1) echogenicity is seen in the
left ventricle, adjacent to the lateral wall, consistent with
thrombus. There is probable additional mural thrombosis closer
to the apex. The right ventricular cavity is moderately dilated
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The ascending aorta
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
stenosis. Midsystolic closure of the aortic leaflets is seen.
Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Massively dilated left ventricle with severe global
systolic dysfunction and low cardiac output. Dilated and
hypokinetic right ventricle. Probable left ventricular thrombus.
Moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary
hypertension.
.
CXR [**2179-8-20**]:
The position of the multiple chest tubes and lines is
essentially unchanged
since the prior chest x-ray. The right lung is clear. There is
some
atelectasis in the lower lobe present. Pneumothorax is still
present on the
left side, essentially unchanged since the prior chest x-ray.
There is no
right pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION: No significant change. No right pneumothorax.
