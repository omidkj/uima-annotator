DATE OF DISCHARGE IS PENDING

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   This is a 76 year old male with
a history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery
disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic
renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease with recent admissions for
cellulitis and Pseudomonal pneumonia, complicated by a non-ST
myocardial infarction and a congestive heart failure
exacerbation.  He was recently discharged from the [**Hospital1 1444**] on [**2193-10-24**] with the
diagnosis of pneumonia, treated with Ciprofloxacin and
ceftazidime to complete a course of 21 days for Pseudomonal
pneumonia.  He was also continued on subcutaneous heparin
with a super-therapeutic INR on Coumadin.

Two days prior to admission, the patient presented with
worsening right lower quadrant pain, worse with movement,
positive cough, positive diarrhea for ten days; positive
weakness and nausea, vomiting.  No chest pain, no shortness
of breath, no fever or chills.  Positive dysuria with
decreased urine output and tea colored urine, but no flank
pain.

At the outside rehabilitation, the patient's white blood cell
count was reportedly 30.0 and documented at 13.1.  In the
Emergency Room, the patient had stool cultures, abdominal CT
scan, surgical consultation and was started on Flagyl.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   On admission, temperature 97.3 F.;
blood pressure 193/60; pulse 76; respiratory rate 22; O2 97%
on two liters.  In general, the patient was moaning in mild
distress.  HEENT:  Oropharynx was clear.  White coating on
the tongue.  Surgical pupils.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate
and rhythm.  Pulmonary with diffuse rhonchi bilaterally with
gurgling breath sounds bilaterally.  Abdomen was soft,
distended. Multiple erythematous spots.  Positive bowel
sounds.  Extremities with no edema but chronic lower
extremity venous changes and one plus dorsalis pedis pulses
bilaterally.  Neurological: Cranial nerves II through XII
were intact.  Skin with ecchymoses over his right chest and
abdomen.

LABORATORY:  On admission were notable for a white blood cell
count of 14.5 with 28% neutrophils, 31.4 hematocrit,
platelets of 148.  Chem-7 with sodium of 131, potassium 5.0,
chloride 97, bicarbonate 29, BUN 58, creatinine 2.8, glucose
147.  Calcium 8.4, phosphorus 1.0, magnesium 1.8, lactate at
2.9.

ALT 47, alkaline phosphatase 138, AST 39, amylase 40, lipase
16, albumin 2.9, total bilirubin 0.3.

CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with a right rectus sheath,
soft tissue mass likely hematoma, most likely abscess.

Chest x-ray with congestive heart failure; no change from
[**10-22**].  No opacities.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   This is a 76 year old gentleman with a
history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure,
chronic renal insufficiency, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with recurrent
pneumonias.  He is here initially for diarrhea, dyspnea and
abdominal pain.

1.  RIGHT SIDED ABDOMINAL PAIN:  Per CT scan, evidence of a
hematoma.  The patient's INR was super-therapeutic at the
rehabilitation facility and he was continued on subcutaneous
heparin injections.  He likely had hematoma develop at site
of subcutaneous heparin injections.

Discontinued anti-coagulation.  The patient's hematoma
resolved and the patient's pain improved.  The patient also
had an abdominal ultrasound which showed only gallbladder
stones with no evidence of cholecystitis.  The patient's
abdominal pain improved throughout the course of his stay.
The patient remained free of right sided abdominal pain after
this initial hematoma resolved; however, the patient did have
episodes of elevations in his liver function tests with
negative ultrasounds and resolution of the liver function
tests most likely considered secondary to right heart failure
causing hepatic congestion.

Liver function tests improved on their otherwise, however,
towards the early part of [**Month (only) 1096**], the patient starting
having rising alkaline phosphatase up to 6/600 and at the
time of this dictation, his total bilirubin was negative.
Repeat ultrasound was unchanged, now with no evidence of
cholecystitis or common bile duct septal dilatations.

The patient will consider plans for an MRCP to evaluate his
biliary system at a future point when the patient can
tolerate MRI and laying flat; however, right now, the patient
is not ready for that, but this will continue to be followed
closely.

2.  DYSPNEA:  The patient has a long standing history of
congestive heart failure exacerbations versus recurrent
pneumonias.  The patient, during this admission, continued to
have pneumonia with positive sputum cultures and as was not
improving with aggressive diuresis, the patient had a Speech
and Swallow evaluation which showed severe dysphagia.  The
patient was showing to have recurring aspiration pneumonia.

The patient was then made n.p.o. and started on tube feeds
through an nasogastric tube until a GJ tube could be placed.
However, as nutritional status improved, the patient's
swallowing ability improved by video swallow evaluation and
the patient was started on soft solids and thin liquids with
chin tuck temporarily.  However, the patient was likely
continuing to aspirate as was probably not doing chin tuck
with just water flushes.  The patient was then made strictly
n.p.o. with no ice chips; otherwise the patient was
continuing to get his nutrition through his GJ tube.

However, the patient's initial dyspnea on arrival was
considered more likely secondary to congestive heart failure
and fluid overload.  The patient was seen and evaluated by
the congestive heart failure team as he was not responding
initially to Lasix.

The patient was then transferred and started on Natrecor,
especially in light of his renal failure; however, the
patient was not responding to Natrecor for diuresis and later
determined was still on steroid for hypokalemia.  This was
discontinued as was Natrecor and the patient was restarted on
Lasix for diuresis.

Eventually, other options were considered for his respiratory
status, including recurrent pneumonia.

As the patient's congestive heart failure exacerbation was
not improving with diuresis, the patient started producing
sputum.  Sputum were sent for cultures and the patient was
continued on diuresis for congestive heart failure.  He then
was found to have a decrease in swallowing ability per Speech
and Swallow evaluation and was made n.p.o.; however, during
this time, the patient was also starting to form hemoptysis.
concern was raised for alveolar hemorrhage with diffuse
pattern on chest x-ray versus tuberculosis although patient
had been ruled out for tuberculosis on his prior admission
with three induced sputum.

The patient was then transferred to the Intensive
