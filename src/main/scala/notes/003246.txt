PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, the patient is a healthy
appearing pleasant gentleman, appropriate for his stated age,
in no apparent distress, laying on a stretcher.  The head and
neck examination showed extraocular movements are intact.
The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.  He has oral thrush and cervical
lymphadenopathy.  There is no thyromegaly.  His chest
examination revealed bilaterally clear to auscultation.  His
heart has a regular rate and rhythm, normal heart sounds, no
murmurs.  His abdomen was soft, nondistended, right upper

His blood electrolytes were within normal limits.  His liver
function tests revealed AST of 155, ALT 226, alkaline
phosphatase 167, total bilirubin 1.0, amylase 78 and lipase

RADIOLOGIC STUDIES:  Chest x-ray revealed clear lungs, no
effusions.  CT scan with p.o. contrast revealed large mass in
the left hepatic lobe. In comparison to [**2200-7-18**], the mass
was larger.  No lesions in the right lobe.  No biliary
dilatation.  Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed extension
of portal venous clot to include the entire main portal vein
to the level of the pancreatic head.  The right portal vein
remains preserved.  There was a known 6.0 centimeter hepatic
lobe mass consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted for scheduled
hepatic lobectomy, cholecystectomy and removal of portal vein
thrombosis.  At the time of presentation, he noted to have
two day history of fever and was found to have a temperature
of 102.8.  Blood culture was sent and failed to identify
organism.  A chest x-ray was negative.  The patient was
started on Ampicillin, Gentamicin and Flagyl for empiric
treatment.  A heparin drip was initiated in attempt to prevent
further extension of the  thrombus in the portal vein.

Fever was thought to be of tumor origin and the patient was
brought to the operating room on [**2200-8-8**].  He underwent a
left hepatic lobectomy, cholecystectomy and removal of portal
vein clot with placement of two [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains.

Pathology report confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma with
tumor thrombosis in the portal vein.  Surgical margins were
positive at the junction of the left portal vein and main portal
vein. Because this was viewed as a palliative resection we did
not consider resection of the entire portal vein with
interposition graft.   He received 18 units of packed red blood
cells, three units of platelets and 11 units of fresh frozen
plasma intraoperatively and postoperatively.

The patient remained intubated postoperatively and was
transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable
condition with epidural in place for pain control.  He
required Propofol to maintain systolic blood pressure less
than 180.  The patient was weaned from Propofol and extubated
postoperative day number one and transferred to the floor on
postoperative day number two.

The patient continued to spike fevers postoperatively despite
antibiotic treatment.  Blood, urine and sputum cultures were
obtained on postoperative day number two. Sputum cultures
were positive for pansensitive Klebsiella.  Chest x-ray
showed possible right middle lobe pneumonia.  Gentamicin was
discontinued when the patient began to experience ringing in
his ears.  Ampicillin and Flagyl were replaced with
Ceftriaxone.  Fevers resolved.

The patient was discharged with one [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drain in
place.  He was given a prescription for two weeks of Bactrim
and instructed to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within one week.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Bactrim DS one tablet p.o. twice a day times ten days.
2.  Epivir HBV 100 mg p.o. once daily.
3.  Percocet 5/325 one to two tablets p.o. q4-6hours p.r.n.
for pain.
4.  Famotidine 20 mg p.o. q.h.s.
5.  Colace 100 mg p.o. twice a day.
