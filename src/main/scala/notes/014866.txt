Brief Hospital Course:
.
In brief, Mr. [**Known lastname 103705**] is a [**Age over 90 **] year old gentleman with a history
of metastatic prostate cancer on mitoxantrone who initially
presented with malaise, sore throat, and fevers. Prior to his
admission on [**2107-12-12**], he was seen in the ED [**2107-12-8**] for these
complaints and was discharged to home with a prescription for
azithromycin. However, his symptoms failed to improve after
treatment so he re-presented to the ED on [**2107-12-12**]. In the ED, he
received cefepime, vanco, and fluconazole as he had recently
been neutropenic and was admitted to OMED on [**2107-12-12**]. On
admission, he was initially treated with vancomycin and cefepime
which was narrowed to cefepime alone when he was found to be
not-neutropenic. There was no obvious source of infection with
normal U/A and CXR. His regular dose of prednisone was held.
.
On the evening of [**2107-12-13**], patient had a witnessed aspiration
event with associated hypoxia. CXR confirmed new infiltrate at L
lung base. He was treated for presumed aspiration pneumonitis in
the ICU. He was cotinued on cefepime alone. He was ruled out for
flu with DFA and all cultures remained negative including urine
legionella Ag. He received aggressive chest PT and O2 was weaned
to RA. He had a swallow evaluation which cleared him for a
pureed diet which was started. He had SBP readings in the 80s,
although asymptomatic, and he received IVF with SBP to 100s. He
received a total of 1.5 L NS during his MICU stay. Labs during
his MICU stay revealed an increase in WBC count (4->7),
significant bandemia of 42%, slight Hct drop (stable on repeat),
