Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 8684**]
Chief Complaint:
Bilateral pulmonary emboli and COPD flare

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
74 yo male NH resident, h/o COPD (on O2), type 2 DM, presenting
with lethargy, hypoglycemia, and SOB; pt was 83-84% with
FSBG=59.  Pt improved with dextrose, O2, and sat's went up to
91%.  Given pt's lethargy, HCT was performed which was negative
for mass effect or bleed.  CXR on admission showed possible
RUL/RML PNA, but was concerning for endobronchial lesion.  F/U
Chest CT showed bilateral PE's, and patient was started on
anticoagulation with coumadin and lovenox.  Pt's vitals o/w
stable.  Pt was on Prednisone taper on admission and got
stress-dose solumedrol in ED.  Pt was initially stable on the
floor, but on hospital day [**1-13**], he had an acute desaturation,
was working hard to breathe/using accessory muscle, and was
transferred to the MICU at this time where he was stabilized
using non-invasive measures (O2 mask, frequent nebs).  Pt
transferred back to floor when he was more stable from a
respiratory standpoint.

diverticulitis, glaucoma, is legally blind,

Brief Hospital Course:
1. Severe B PE.  Pt was initially put on Lovenox 70 [**Hospital1 **] with
coumadin when PE's discovered on chest CT.  Pt was stable for 2
days and then had an acute episode of desaturation, O2 sats
83-84% on 4L, minimal improvement with nebs and 50% facemask.
Chest X-ray did not show any acute process, but patient was
laboring to breathe, using accessory muscles, and was not moving
air very well.  ABG showed some CO2 retention, a normal pH, but
inadequate O2 sat given the amount of facemask O2.  He was
transferred to the MICU at this time where he was managed and
stabilized without intubation (frequent nebs, O2).  TTE showed
possible left mobile PA mass/clot; suggestion was patient was
throwing new clots even though on Lovenox.  Pt started on
Heparin drip, became more stable from a respiratory standpoint,
and he was transferred back to the floor where he has remained
stable on 2 L NC O2, nebs, hep gtt, antibiotics, and steroid
taper.  Heparin was discontinued after 48 hour overlap
(therapeutic on both coumadin and heparin), and patient
discharged on coumadin for lifelong anticoagulation.  IVC filter
should be considered if this anticoagulation is inadequate.

2.  COPD: Pt continued on a prednisone taper (2wks) for possible
COPD flare, likely one of the reasons for his respiratory
distress.  Pt also with frequent nebs and O2 as needed (pt has
baseline 2 L O2 requirement).

3.  ?PNA-normal cxr, afebrile, but did have bandemia on
admission and now with pseudomonas in sputum, resistent to
quinolones. Given allergy to pcn, ceph, wills start aztreonam
for presumptive coverage since he has poor respiratory status.
14-d course of Aztreonam with a 7-day course of Levo for
possible pneumonia with COPD flare.

4.  DM- restart 70/30 at 1/2 dose; will cover with SSI, and cked
FSBG in house.


5.  Psych: continue Effexor, give Ambien for insomnia; hold
Xanax, monitor for signs of benzo withdrawal

6.  FEN- gave boluses as necessary, no standing IVF

7.  PPX- Zantac, MRSA precautions

8.  Pt is now Full code; reversed code status in-house given
possibly reversible cause of respiratory distress.  This should
be reviewed upon return to rehab facility, for patient was
DNR/DNI prior to this admission.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital3 672**] Hospital

Discharge Diagnosis:
Bilateral Pulmonary emboli, COPD flare


Discharge Condition:
Good

Discharge Instructions:
Please let staff at acute rehab know if you are experiencing
chest pain, shortness of breath, fevers, chills, or any other
concerns.
1.  Pt needs monitoring of his coumadin; pt found to have
bilateral severe PE's on chest CT, thought to be chronic.  He
will need lifelong anticoagulation with coumadin. His goal INR
is [**1-13**].  He will need an INR ck in the morning of [**7-3**]; pt
currently on 5mg coumadin each day.  If lifelong anticoagulation
proves to be inadequate, an IVC filter should be considered.
2.  Pt was DNR/DNI before this hospitalization; code status was
reversed given the possibly reversible nature of his pulmonary
emboli.  This should be rediscussed; it is reasonable to resume
patient's prior code status.
3.  Pt has a relatively new diagnosis of [**Name (NI) **] dementia
(from last 1-2 months).

Followup Instructions:
Will have f/u at rehabilitation facility
Need INR checks regularly for coumadin therapy
