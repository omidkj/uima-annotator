.
ECG- sinus tachycardia at 144bpm, RBBB with LAFB, TWI in aVL but
otherwise no significant change from prior study on [**10-14**]
.
CXR ([**10-17**])- Accounting for technical differences, I do not see
any significant interval change.  Slight blunting of the
costophrenic sulci could be fibrosis or fluid. Continued
followup is recommended.
.
CXR ([**10-15**])- Less prominent interstitial markings versus prior
with no evidence for CHF.  No new consolidations.
.
CXR ([**10-13**])- Comparison is made to [**2135-4-11**].  Comparison is
also made to [**2135-4-9**].  Right middle lobe opacity has
mostly resolved, but there is persistent opacity in the right
upper lobe, perhaps due to traction bronchiectasis in part, but
also likely due to an atypical appearance of mild congestive
heart failure.  There is a diffuse hazy opacity seen on the
lateral view, probably also due to mild congestive heart
failure.

REFERRING DOCTOR: DR. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: >= 55% (nl >=55%)
Aortic Valve - Peak Velocity: 0.9 m/sec (nl <= 2.0 m/sec)
Mitral Valve - E Wave: 0.7 m/sec
Mitral Valve - A Wave: 1.0 m/sec
Mitral Valve - E/A Ratio: 0.70
Mitral Valve - E Wave Deceleration Time: 227 msec
TR Gradient (+ RA = PASP): 20 mm Hg (nl <= 25 mm Hg)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2135-4-5**].


LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Normal regional LV systolic function. No resting
LVOT gradient.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTIC VALVE: No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Normal PA
systolic pressure.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets
with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor parasternal
views.

Conclusions:
Limited study. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and
systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall
motion is
normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal
with trivial mitral regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary
artery systolic
pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic
function.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2135-4-5**],
the findings
appear similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 82F with COPD on home O2, h/o DVT/PE on Coumadin, DM,
presenting with respiratory distress.
.
1. COPD exacerbation: The patient was treated on admission for
respiratory distress/COPD exacerbation. She was maintained on
nasal cannula O2, nebulizers, and began a oral steroid taper.
She was also started on azithromycin. On [**10-15**], one day after
admission, she was found to have tachypnea (RR 44) with stable
O2sats at 94% 2L NC. She had bibasilar crackles on exam and no
wheezes. She was given nebs and 1mg morphine. On [**10-17**], she was
again tachypneic, complaining of SOB, RR 30s-40s and was
admitted to the MICU where she was initially placed on BiPAP but
then required intubation. Sputum culture from [**10-17**] grew MRSA,
and sparse GNR. She was started on vancomycin on [**10-17**], as well
as merepenem for gram negative coverage. She was successfully
extubated on [**2135-8-22**]. She was transferred to the floor [**2135-8-23**].
Since transition to the floor, she has had no pain, been
conversant, breathing comfortably, had good apetite. She was
maintained on O2 nasal cannula, her nebulizers and oral steroid
inhaler, and a prednisone taper. Her blood cultures were
negative and no other organisms other than MRSA were isolated
from her sputum. She was maintained on vancomycin as well as
ceftriaxone for presumed multibacterial pneumonia. In addtion,
influenza DFA was negative. A PICC line was placed on [**10-25**] for
ease of access and completion of a course of IV antibiotics. She
was discharged with expectation of receiving 5 more days of IV
vancomycin and ceftriaxone. She was also discharged on nasal
cannula oxygen, inhaled steroids as she took prior to admit,
steroid taper, and inhalers as she had taken previously.
.
History of PE/DVT: By report, she has a history of PE and DVT
and is on Coumadin as an outpatient. She has been on Coumadin as
early as her admission in [**3-13**].  Her INR was supratherapeutic on
admission on her regimen on 3 mg qd. She was discharged on 2mg
coumadin qd, to be adjusted as determined by her physician.
.
Diabetes: The patient's repaglinide was held when she was
admitted and she was covered with sliding scale insulin but had
some high blood sugars recorded. She was discharged on her
normal oral dose, but on day before discharge still had some
high blood sugars which were covered with sliding scale insulin.
She may need to have an increase in her
