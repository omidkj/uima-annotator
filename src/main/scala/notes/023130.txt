Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 25936**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of Breath

Embolization of artery for retroperitoneal bleed


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 78F with h/o COPD, afib on coumadin, mild-mod
mitral stenosis, Echo [**2187**] LVEF 60%, who presents from [**Hospital1 2292**] where she was there for eval of a rash. On further
questioning, however, she noted that she has had a great deal of
dyspnea on exertion recently. She says she had been feeling weak
and miserable. At baseline, she can walk around and perform all
ADL's but the 2-3 days before admission, she felt too weak and
sick to do anything. Denies fevers/chills. No sick contacts/no
recent illnesses.

At [**Hospital1 **], they did an EKG there for hx of DOE and
they found afib with rvr to 140. She received albuterol and
combivent and 250cc bolus prior to arrival to ER. Of note
patient stopped smoking 3 days before admission. She sats in the
low 90's on room air at baseline.

.
CXR ([**7-22**]):
1.  Pulmonary vascular congestion without effusion.
2.  Rounded opacity in the right lung base is likely a nipple
shadow, but
follow-up radiograph with nipple markers may be obtained for
confirmation
after diuresis.
.
Echo ([**7-25**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. No left atrial
mass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal
echocardiography). No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is at least
15 mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). The
estimated cardiac index is high (>4.0L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler
imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated
with normal free wall contractility. There is abnormal septal
motion/position consistent with right ventricular
pressure/volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. The mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic
deformity. There is a minimally increased gradient consistent
with trivial mitral stenosis. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
.
IMPRESSION: Minimal mitral stenosis. Normal left ventricular
cavity size with preserved regional and global lar systolic
function. Moderate pulmonary artery hypertension. Right
ventricular cavity enlargement with preserved free wall motino.
Moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
.
CT Chest ([**7-28**]):As shown on a previous serial chest radiographs,
mild pulmonary edema is improving. Centrilobular emphysema is
moderate. A few less than 5 mm nodules are scattered throughout
the lungs.  A chest
CT followup should be done in six months.
.
Cardiac cath ([**7-29**]): Active bleeding from superior branch of
right lumbar artery. Successful placement of microspheres
followed by coil embolization of the lumbar artery
.
CTAP ([**7-29**]): Large 9.8 x 12.1 cm right retroperitoneal hematoma
with evidence of active arterial extravasation, the largest of
which is in the right iliacus.  An IR consult should be
obtained. Moderate multifocal stenosis of the right common
iliac, external iliac and common femoral artery with possible
focal areas of high grade stenoses.  Likely moderate focal
stenosis in the distal left common iliac artery. Diffuse
calcific atherosclerosis in the the distal external iliac
arteries is also noted bilaterally.
.
Renal U/S ([**8-3**]): Large right heterogenous retroperitoneal
hematoma with mild displacement of the right peri-renal space.
However, no evidence of resulting mass effect, compression or
hydronephrosis on the right kidney.
.

Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old female with a PMHx of AFib presents short of breath
and found to have AFib with RVR, pulmonary edema, and some
component of COPD exacerbation. The patient's stay was
complicated by a right sided retroperitoneal bleed that was
embolized on [**7-29**] (right lumbar artery).
 .
# Retroperitoneal bleed: Unclear nidus of injury. s/p successful
embolization of right lumbar [**Last Name (un) **] on [**7-29**]. Pt noted to have
spontaneous retroperitoneal bleed [**2191-7-29**] AM on CT scan likely
began [**2191-7-28**] PM as pt at that time complained of sudden onset
right hip pain. No history of trauma, falls or procedures other
than cardioversion on [**7-26**]. - Her INR was supratherapeutic on
admission(6.5 on [**7-22**]) and was allowed to trend down during the
course of her admission. Restarted warfarin 5mg  and heparin
bridge on [**7-27**]. INR on 8/30PM = 1.2, [**7-29**] AM = 1.5. PTT was
supratherapeutic 8/30AM then 8/30PM PTT 68. On [**7-29**] AM PTT=68.9.
LAST warfarin dose on [**7-28**] 4pm. On [**7-29**] pt transferred to CCU
after above events and Hct drop from 32 to 23, and her SBPs
60s-70a. She received 2U RBC and 2U FFP with BPs returning to
100s/60s prior to emobilization of right lumbar artery by
interventional cardiology.  After em
