History of Present Illness:
49 year old female with recently diagnosed alcoholic
cirrhosis and transferred from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] for abdominal pain.
Patient has been complaining of intermittent abdominal pain for
the past 4 weeks. This has been getting progressively worse for
the past 3-4 days, diffuse and sharp in nature. Associated with
fevers, chill, decreased urine output and diarrhea x 4 days. She
was diagnosed with ESLD about 3 months ago without h/o SBP. She
states she was drinking 6 glasses of wine a day, but has not
been
drinking for the past weeks. She went to OSH yesterday, she was
noted to have leukocytosis with WBC 30.8, was given
vancomycin/zosyn and transferred to the MICU at [**Hospital1 18**]. In the
MICU patient had diagnostic tap which showed 6000 WBC, 85 polys
and the culture is growing GNRs. She was treated empirically for
SBP and transferred to the floor as she was hemodinamically
stable. Given worsening abdominal pain and tenderness a CT was
done showing diffuse loculated free air concerning for
pneumatosis and visceral perforation.

Imaging:

RUQ U/S:
1. Coarse echotexture and lobulated contour of the liver,
suggestive of cirrhosis. No discrete hepatic lesion is
identified.
2. CBD is dilated measuring up to 11 mm in maximum diameter. No
biliary stone is visualized.
3. Moderate-to-large amount of ascites within the abdomen with
increased echogenicity and internal septations.

CT A/P (prelim):
1. Diffuse intra-abdominal ascites and free air with areas of
loculated air (also possibly pneumatosis)consistent with
perforated viscous. Small bowel appears thickened (image 2:63)
which in the setting of ascites may be a result of portal
hypertension, however the constellation of findings indicates
visceral perforation possibly on the basis of ischemia. The
exact
area of perforation is unable to be determined.
2. Bilateral pleural effusions
3. No evidence of hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis.
