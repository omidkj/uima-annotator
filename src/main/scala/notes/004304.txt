Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Aspirin

Attending:[**Doctor First Name 1402**]
Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation.


History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] yo male with pmhx significant for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
and coronary artery disease was admitted from the ED for [**2-14**]
days of shortness of breath. Patient is a poor historian but
reports that he has a [**2-14**] day history of shortness of breath,
"wobbly on my feet," and generally "wasn't feeling good." He
then called his PCP who recommended that patient call EMS to be
taken to the hospital. On ROS, patient notes that he sleeps in a
chair but denies leg swelling, PND, or palpitations. Patient
reports that he takes his medications regularly but does
occasionally "cheat" with his diabetic diet. On additional ROS,
patient reports diffuse abdominal pain for 2-3 days, decreased
appetite for several days, and URI 5 days ago which has
improved. Patient otherwise denies dysuria, hematuria, diarrhea,
constipation, fevers, chills, or night sweats.
.
Patient was brought to the ED by EMS where he was given 3x NTG
and 180mg lasix IV. In the ED, VS were HR 120s / BP 125/72 / RR
28 / 98% on NRB / 1900 total UOP. Patient was initially placed
on BiPap and then lowered to 4.5L NC. Received aspirin 325mg and
was admitted.
.
Of note, patient was previously admitted to the hospital in
[**2155-11-12**] with a similar episode of shortness of breath with
dry cough. At that time, he was thought to have a CHF
exacerbation secondary to medication noncompliance and underwent
diuresis with improvement in SOB. Patient was discharged with
outpatient cardiology follow-up but did not follow-up.

[**2156-1-8**] CXR:
CHEST, ONE VIEW: Comparison with chest radiograph of [**2155-11-19**] and chest CT, [**2155-11-19**]. There are bilateral
moderate pleural effusions, similar to the previous exam.
Bilateral lower lobe opacities can represent atelectasis,
aspiration, or pneumonia. Cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar
contours are unchanged. No pneumothorax. Osseous structures are
unchanged.
IMPRESSION: Similar appearance of bilateral lower lobe
atelectasis/aspiration/pneumonia and bilateral moderate pleural
effusions.
.
[**2156-1-10**] Echo:
Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. The estimated right atrial
pressure is
11-15mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The
left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. An echodensity
suggestive of a large apical mural thrombus is seen in the left
ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
severely depressed (ejection farction 20 percent) secondary to
severe hypokinesis of all walls except the lateral wall. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
no pericardial effusion.
Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed)
of [**2155-11-21**], the left ventricular ejection fraction is
further reduced, the mitral regurgitation appears reduced
(although it may not optimally have been displayed on the
present study), and the presence of an echodensity in the left
ventricle suggestive of an apical mural thrombus is now noted.

[**2156-1-19**] XRay right foot:  IMPRESSION:
1. Curvilinear calcification located medially to the navicular
bone could represent vascular calcification, but an avulsion
injury cannot be excluded.
2. Os naviculare.

[**2156-1-20**] CT right foot: read from MS fellow: no fracture.

Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo male with CAD, DMII admitted with CHF exacerbation who had
flash pulmonary edema requiring intubation.  He improved, was
extubated.  Hospital course complicated by new tachycardia and
delirium.  Now with right foot pain.

#. Cardiac
A. Rhythm: Patient has a question of new diagnosis of atrial
tachycardia, although P waves apear to be similar to old EKGs
ddx also included benzo withdrawl despite family's insistence
that he was not taking valium more than once a month.  The
tachycardia is thought to be the precipitating factor for this
admission's CHF.  His Toprolol was titrated up from 25mg to
200mg QD. We called his PCP's, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 172**], office for old EKGs;
Old EKG showed rate in 70's with no obvious difference in P wave
morphology. He had some ectopy thought to be a variant of this
atrial tachycardia (SVT with aberrancy).
.
B. Cardiomyopathy: Pt with h/o CHF with EF 25-30% and 2+ MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **]
had an acute CHF exacerbation with flash pulmonary edema. DDx
flash edema includes includes worsening MR, atrial tach, HTN [**2-13**]
holding lisinopril in setting of MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **].  Pt ruled out for
MI and had no new EKG changes suggestive of ischemia. Also
lisinopril was restarted at a lower dose 2.5mg (home dose was
20mg QD) because of need to increase beta blocker for
tachycardia.  Patient had decreased intake because of clearing
delirium at discharge.  He was euvolemic at discharge. He is on
20mg lasix daily.
- Patient needs to be weighed every day.  If he gains more than
2 lbs he should take 40mg of lasix (his home dose).
.
C. Coronaries: Patient with a presumed CAD and prior MI,
although no records here. No current chest pain or acute
ischemic changes on EKG. CE neg.  Medical management with home
doses of atrovastatin 20mg, plavix 75mg.  His metoprolol was
increased for rate control with compensatory decrease in
lisinopril to maintain blood pressure.  Restarted aspirin 81mg
(has listed GI bleed as allergy).
.
# ARF: Patient had episode of ARF with Creatinine bump to 1.4,
from baseline 1.0, thought to be pre-renal from low CO.  ACE I
was held during renal failure.
.
# PNA: Completed a 7 day course on [**2156-1-16**] of zosyn for
pneumonia. Patients white count and fevers decreased and he was
afebrile at discharge.
.
#. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus-- He was discharged on Lantus dose
22U (on half doses for NPO and poor PO intake). As he began
eating we added back Humalog at meals (3U) and covered with
insulin sliding scale.
.
# Right foot pain-- Patient with 3 days of right foot pain.
redness and minimal swelling in medial ankle/foot arch.  Thought
to be secondary to a mechanical trauma.  No break in the skin.
Ddx is bruise/fracture/osteo.  Right foot x-rays an
