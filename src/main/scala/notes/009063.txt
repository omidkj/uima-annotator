CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dizziness and dark stools.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old male with
a nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection
fraction of less than 20%, chronic renal insufficiency with a
baseline creatinine of roughly 2, and atrial fibrillation
diagnosed in [**2137-12-7**], who was in his usual state of
fair health until the last several when he started noticing
that he was dizzy with orthostatic symptoms.

In the last one to two weeks prior to developing this
dizziness the patient had been noticing dark stools, but he
had also begun taking iron and attributed the darkened stools
to the iron.  He says his stool at the time of admission had
progressed to the point of becoming black and tarry.  The
patient describes no abdominal pain, constipation, or bright
red blood per rectum.  In addition to dizziness, he also
reports some mild exertional dyspnea and palpitations, but no
chest pain.

Of note, the patient was using Aleve twice a day over the
last several weeks for a flare of gouty arthritis in his
foot.  His Coumadin dose otherwise has been stable.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20%,
clean coronary arteries, 1+ mitral regurgitation.
2.  Chronic renal insufficiency (with a baseline creatinine
of around 2, has been rising recently).
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Gout.
5.  Iron deficiency anemia.
6.  History of gastrointestinal bleed.  Last
esophagogastroduodenoscopy on [**2137-9-2**], which showed
antral gastritis.
7.  Last colonoscopy on [**2138-2-7**], showed five sigmoid
polyps and grade II internal hemorrhoids; also
diverticulosis.
8.  History of cerebrovascular accident versus transient
ischemic attack in [**2128**].
9.  History of atrial fibrillation; now in normal sinus
rhythm.

ALLERGIES:  Allergy possibly to ISORDIL  and ZAROXOLYN.

FAMILY HISTORY:   No colon cancer.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Admission physical
examination revealed vital signs with a temperature of 96,
pulse of 73, blood pressure of 150/70, heart rate of 19,
oxygen saturation of 100% on room air.  Head, eyes, ears,
nose, and throat revealed pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  Extraocular movements were intact.
Sclerae were anicteric, but bilateral arcus senilis was
noted.  Conjunctivae were pale.  Mucous membranes were moist.
Neck was supple, no lymphadenopathy, and no jugular venous
distention.  Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rhythm, normal
rate.  Normal first heart sound and second heart sound.  No
third heart sound or fourth heart sound.  A [**2-12**] holosystolic
murmur at the left lower sternal border radiating to the
apex.  Abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, normal
active bowel sounds.  Extremities revealed no clubbing,
cyanosis or edema.  Rectal examination was heme-positive,
black/tarry stool. Normal digital examination.  Neurologic
examination, alert and oriented times three.  Cranial nerves
II through XII were grossly intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  Admission
laboratories revealed a white blood cell count of 9.9,
hematocrit of 16, and platelets of 255.  PT of 43.7, PTT
of 45, INR of 13.3.  AST of 29, ALT of 36, LDH of 209,
amylase of 88, total bilirubin of 0.2.  SMA-7 revealed sodium
of 139, potassium of 4.2, chloride of 105, bicarbonate of 24,
blood urea nitrogen of 51, creatinine of 2.2, blood sugar
of 134.  Digoxin level of 1.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Chest x-ray showed no infiltrates or
opacifications.  No pneumothorax or effusions.

Electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate
of 73.  Intervals were normal.  Flattened T waves in V4
through V6, I, and L.  No change from [**2138-2-11**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit with acute blood loss anemia and an
elevated INR.

He received 3 units of packed red blood cells, and his
anticoagulation was reversed with vitamin K 5 mg
intravenously and 5 mg subcutaneous times one.

An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed on [**5-15**] which
revealed a moderate reducible hiatal hernia but a normal
stomach and duodenal mucosa.  After the patient's 3 units of
packed red blood cells, his hematocrit was stable at 26, and
he had no further melenic stools.  The patient's INR came
down to 1.2 over the first 48 hours.

Iron studies sent one month prior to admission showed the
following:  An iron of 36, a TIBC of 472, and ferritin of 19.
A thyroid-stimulating hormone had been done in [**2137-5-7**] which was 2.

On the evening of [**2138-5-16**], the patient was called out
from the Intensive Care Unit to the floor for further
monitoring.  Overnight, the patient was stable with no
complaints; and, again, no further bloody stool production.
He was able to ambulate the halls as was tolerating p.o.
well.  His hematocrit remained stable at 26, and his INR was
stable at 1.2.  The patient's Diovan was restarted after his
creatinine had come down to 1.8 (which was in his baseline
range).  He was seen by Gastrointestinal and felt to be
stable for discharge on [**2138-5-17**].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:   Clinical history consistent with upper
gastrointestinal bleed; source unclear after
esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  Lower gastrointestinal workup
pending.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:   (No Coumadin and no Aleve)
1.  Toprol-XL 75 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Lasix 80 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Digoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Allopurinol 200 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Hydralazine 10 mg p.o. q.i.d.
6.  Iron sulfate 325 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP:  The patient was to follow up with
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] on [**2138-5-20**] at 2:30 p.m.  This
appointment has been arranged. The patient will need to
arrange an appointment for a small-bowel follow-through; and
after those results are obtained an appointment will need to
be arranged with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 17185**] of Gastroenterology for further
followup.
