Physical Exam:
Upon admission:

97.3  61  112/53  16  94% room air

Gen: Uncomfortable appearing
CV: Regular rate and rhythm
Abd: Soft, non-distended
Rectum: Prolapsed, irreducible, globular appears bright red,
edematous, frank blood


Pertinent Results:
Operative note [**4-14**]:
Respiratory failure secondary to
severe cervical tracheomalacia.

PROCEDURE:  Rigid bronchoscopy, flexible bronchoscopy,
metallic covered stent placement and balloon dilatation.

GYN Porcedure note;
Procedures: estrace cream applied to prolpased vault, gellhorn
pessary placed without difficulty

Echo [**4-6**]:
IMPRESSION: Symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
global and
regional systolic function. Mild aortic regurgitation. Moderate
tricuspid
regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Mildly dilated
thoracic aorta.

Persantine MIBI/ Stress test:
IMPRESSION: There is a small, mildly severe reversible perfusion
defect in the anteroapical wall. There is normal left
ventricular wall motion and cavity size.
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes.
Nuclear
report sent separately.

Chest X-ray [**4-5**]:
IMPRESSION:
1) No acute cardiopulmonary process identified.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2197-4-5**]  2:36:32 PM
Baseline artifact. Atrial paced rhythm with a rate of about 64
beats per minute
with A-V interval of about 210 milliseconds. Native QRS shows
left ventricular
conduction delay with left axis deviation. Compared to the
previous tracing
of [**2197-3-29**] no diagnostic change.

Chest CT [**4-11**]:
1) Moderate layering non-hemorrhagic bilateral pleural
effusions, with secondary bibasilar atelectasis and retained
secretions in occluded right basilar segmental bronchi.
2) Focal tracheomalacia in the upper trachea.
3) Large left goiter.
4) Left lower lobe opacity could represent aspiration.
5) Low attenuation in the mid pole of the right kidney,
incompletely characterized. This may represent sequelae of
cortical scarring, but an ultrasound is recommended to exclude
an underlying lesion.

Bilateral upper extremitiy ultrasound:
IMPRESSION: Thrombosis in the right internal jugular vein.

Thyroid ultrasound:
IMPRESSION: Successful ultrasound-guided aspiration of large
heterogeneous left thyroid lobe which extends into the superior
mediastinum.

Chest X-ray [**4-17**]:
Tracheal stent remains in place with a distal portion of the
stent just above the level of the clavicles. Vascular catheter
and permanent pacemaker are unchanged in position. Cardiac
silhouette is mildly enlarged but stable in size. Vascular
engorgement and perihilar haziness are slightly worse compared
to the prior study. Bibasilar opacities predominantly in the
retrocardiac region with adjacent pleural effusions are
unchanged allowing for lower lung volumes.

There is increasing distension of bowel loops in the upper
abdomen as compared to the previous study. This is incompletely
assessed on this chest radiograph, and dedicated abdominal
radiograph could be obtained for more complete evaluation if
warranted clinically.

Chest X-ray [**4-20**]:
IMPRESSION: Increased lung volumes but overall no significant
change in bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar opacities
that are concerning for pneumonia.

   MRSA SCREEN (Final [**2197-4-20**]):    No MRSA isolated.

FNA, Thyroid, left nodule:
ATYPICAL.
The specimen consists of mostly blood and a single group  of
atypical cells.
Note: Clinical follow-up is suggested.
Re-biopsy may be considered if clinically appropriate.

Cardiology Report ECG Study Date of [**2197-4-10**]  4:56:10 PM
Atrial fibrillation
Ventricular premature complex
Intraventricular conduction delay with left axis deviation - may
be atypical
left bundle branch block
Delayed R wave progression - could be due in part to left axis
deviation/intraventricular delay or possible prior septal
myocardial infarction
ST-T wave abnormalities - could be in part intraventricular
conduction delay
Since previous tracing of [**2197-4-9**], atrial fibrillation absent

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 47716**] presented with recurrent rectal prolapse and
admitted to the surgical service for further management. A
cardiology consult was placed for pre-operative clearance, which
included, beta-blockade, diuresis, Persantine MIBI, Echo, and
EKG; she had no anginal symptoms or ST segment changes and was
cleared to proceed with surgical intervention.
HD 3, she underwent a suture rectopexy without complication,
post-operatively she required re-intubation x2 in recovery room
secondary to respiratory distress, she was transferred to
intensive care unit for close monitoring.

Pulm: POD 5, she underwent a CT scan of the chest secondary to
failed weaning attempts despite intravenous steroids, bedside
bronchoscopies, and nebulizer treatments, she was found to have
focal tracheomalacia in the upper trachea and a large left
goiter, thoracic surgery was consulted along with Interventional
Pulmonary; she was taken back to the OR on POD 7, and underwent
a rigid bronchoscopy and placement of a metallic stent without
complication. She was extubated without difficulty and was
successfully weaned to 2 liters nasal cannula. At the time of
discharge she had continued improvement in her oxygenation with
the assistance of 2 liters nasal cannula, and nebulizer
treatments; although she continued to experience an intermittent
sensation of food being stuck without signs or symptoms of
aspiration, a chest x-ray done on POD 12 demonstrated the stent
to be in good position with overall improvement in her bibasilar
pleural effusions, she was continued on daily diuresis of Lasix
which was to continue for 14 additional days. She was to
follow-up on [**5-8**] as an out-patient with IP for a bronchoscopy.
