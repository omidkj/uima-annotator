Conclusions
Pre bypass: There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with apical hypokineis. LVEF 45-55%. Basal septal
hypokiesis can not be excluded due to image quality. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

Post bypass: Patient is paced on phenylepherine infusion. No
change in wall motion. Aortic contours intact. Remaining exam is
unchanged. All finidngs discussed with surgeons at the time of
the exam.
I certify that I was present for this procedure in compliance
with HCFA regulations.
