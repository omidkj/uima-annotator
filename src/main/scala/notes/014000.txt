Chief Complaint:
mini-MUD non-myeloablative transplant with campath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar Puncture
Intubation
CVVHD

History of Present Illness:
38 year old female with relapsed Nodular-Sclerosing Hodgkin's
lymphoma s/p autoSCT being admitted for a nonmyelablative (mini)
allogeneic transplant from a MUD.  She has been feeling well
recently.  She does note baseline shortness of breath from
pulmonary involvement of disease, but no oxygen requirement. She
has been increasing her activity with improvement in her
respiratory status. She denies any bleeding including blood in
urine or stool, epistaxis or gum bleeding. No recent fevers,
nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. She has had chronic sciatic
pain for which is on narcotics and that may have been a little
worse today. She also had an episode of diaphoresis today.


Past Medical History:
Oncology History: Diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, nodular
sclerosing) in [**2123**]. The patient initially was treated with
Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine with subsequent
disease recurrence. Transplant was deferred at that time, and
the patient received four cycles of CEPT. She also received
radiation therapy as part of initial treatment for six weeks.
She had an autologous [**Year (4 digits) 3242**] in 4/[**2128**]. In [**2-/2130**] (about one year
post transplant) a CT evaluation revealed recurrent disease in
her chest and abdomen. Anterior mediastinal adenopathy was in
the field of prior radiation. She underwent a biopsy of her
anterior mediastinal adenopathy that revealed recurrent
Hodgkin's lymphoma. She was then treated with CEPP chemotherapy.
She had a variable response to CEPP and was started most
recently on Rituxan and Vinblastine and then just completed 3rd
course of ICE. PET/CT done in [**2-/2131**] still shows some FDG avid
lesions in lung.
.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Hodgkin's lymphoma with the details described above.
2. Splenectomy in [**2126**].
3. History of herpes zoster.
4. History of Phen-Phen use.
5. Previous history of clot in left SVC. She was on Coumadin
for a period of time but this has been held due to her low
platelet count.
6. Paralyzed vocal cords.


Social History:
[**Known firstname **] is single, and lives with the father of
her 11-year-old son. She denies tobacco or alcohol use. She has

worked occasionally at a convenient store.


Family History:
Significant for her mother who passed away from
a myocardial infarction. Her father was diagnosed recently with

pancreatic liver and colon cancer of unknown primary.

[**2131-5-16**] MRI L-spine:
IMPRESSION:
1. No abnormal epidural soft tissue or abnormal epidural fluid
collections.
2. No evidence of spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.
3. Extensive retroperitoneal adenopathy that is better assessed
on a recent PET CT.
.
[**5-17**] CXR
IMPRESSION: Apparent slight enlargement of bilateral pleural
effusions, left greater than right, which may be accentuated by
lower lung volumes on the current study.
.
[**5-18**] CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**4-4**] through [**5-17**].

Left hemidiaphragm is chronically significantly elevated and the
resultant left lower lobe is chronically collapsed. Moderate
left pleural effusion was little changed between [**4-4**] and [**5-16**], but has increased subsequently. Right lung is clear.
Mediastinum remains shifted to the left inferiorly and
superiorly to the right. The tips of bilateral central venous
lines project over the SVC. No pneumothorax.
.
[**5-22**] CT chest w/o contrast
IMPRESSION:

1. New, extensive consolidation within the left lung. The
differential diagnosis includes infection or marked radiation
pneumonitis.

2. Increase in small-to-moderate left partially loculated
pleural effusion with possible component of pleural thickening.
The differential diagnosis includes parapneumonic
effusion/empyema, or neoplastic involvement of the pleura.

3. Marked increase in left chest wall and breast edema could
represent post- radiation change or lymphatic obstruction. No
significant interval change in left chest wall and mediastinal
masses, although comparison is difficult due to technique.

4. Mild pulmonary edema.

5. Questionable new nodule in right middle lobe, difficult to
assess due to motion artifact in this area. Attention to this
region is recommended on followup.
.
[**5-23**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. Increased left pleural effusion resulting in complete
opacification of the left hemithorax.
2. Resolution of pulmonary edema.
.
[**5-30**] CXR
IMPRESSION: Mild improvement in left upper lung aeration.
.
[**6-1**] CXR
IMPRESSION:
1. Stable bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
2. Improving aeration, left upper lobe.
.
[**6-14**] CT w/o contrast of chest, abdomen and pelvis
IMPRESSION:
1. Improving left lung aeration.
2. Unchanged left chest wall and breast edema secondary to
lymphatic obstruction or post- radiation change.
3. Multiple mediastinal and chest wall masses, relatively
unchanged, but new pulmonary nodules in the right middle lobe
are identified. No fluid collections in the abdomen or pelvis,
or other definite evidence.
.
[**2131-6-14**] CT head w/o contrast
IMPRESSION: Bilateral frontal subcortical white matter
hypodensity, more prominent on the left. The findings are
potentially concerning for leukoencephalopathy, although, in the
appropriate clinical setting, could represent
subacute-to-chronic borderzone infarcts. MRI of the brain
without and with gadolinium is recommended for further
evaluation.
.
[**6-15**] MR brain w/ gad
IMPRESSION:

White matter edema in the left frontal region, predominantly
posteriorly. No abnormal enhancement noted. These findings could
be due to an area of lymphomatous involvement (though it is more
common to see contrast enhancement at such involvements); other
differential diagnosis to be considered are progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy, encephalitis.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 38 year-old female with refractory and
recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma, status post auto-[**Month/Year (2) 3242**] in [**2128**],
asplenic, and status post multiple chemotherapeutic regimens,
s/p Mini allo-MUD [**Year (4 digits) 3242**] on [**2131-5-22**].
.
Hodgkins Lymphoma: She had a response to ICE and it was felt
that her disease burden was low enough to allow the SCT. Her
donor is a male who is CMV positive with blood type A+. She is
CMV positive, her blood type is O+.  Her conditioning regimen
consisted of Campath, fludarabine, and Cytoxan.  Her POC
remained in place during her transplant given her history of
chest wall edema and the risk of poor healing.  Her Mini
allo-MUD [**Date Range 3242**] occurred on [**2131-5-22**].  She was initially started on
Cyclosporine for GVHD prophylaxis but she subsequently developed
ARF requiring HD so this was stopped and high-dose
Methylprednisolone was started in place. The pt was also started
on clotrimazole, nystastin, and ursodiol for prophylaxis and
given a dose of aerisolized pentamadine and then bactrim fo
