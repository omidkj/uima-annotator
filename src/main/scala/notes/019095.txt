Admission Date:  [**2140-2-9**]       Discharge Date:  [**2140-2-27**]

Date of Birth:   [**2078-1-6**]       Sex:  M

Service:  Thoracic Surgery

ADDENDUM:  Please refer to the previously dictated Discharge
Summary covering the period of [**2140-2-9**] through [**2140-2-26**].

As previously stated, the patient was evaluated by Cardiology
Service for his complaint of chest pain which had resolved
with sublingual nitroglycerin in the absence of
electrocardiogram changes.  The patient had cardiac enzymes
with his troponin trending down from 0.07 to 0.05.

Of note, the patient also had a cardiac catheterization in
[**2139-6-2**] which revealed minimal left circumflex disease
with otherwise clear coronary arteries.

The Cardiology Service did not believe the patient's chest
pain to have been cardiac and noted that the patient had
previously had elevated serum troponin levels throughout much
of his hospitalization.  The cause for the elevated serum
troponin was unclear.  The Cardiology Service recommended no
further workup.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Plans for discharge were therefore
finalized.  The patient was to be transferred to a
rehabilitation facility on [**2140-2-27**].

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  The patient's discharge
medications were unchanged from those listed on his prior
Discharge Summary except for the discontinuation of
levofloxacin.
