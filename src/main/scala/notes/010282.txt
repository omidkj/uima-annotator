History of Present Illness:
This is a 58 year old man with a complicated history including
CAD, cardiomyopathy (EF 39%), afib, DM, who presented to an OSH
on [**2101-12-30**] with leg pain and swelling.  History is obtained from
the patient, his family, and OSH medical records.  Mr. [**Known lastname 71839**]
had apparently injured his R leg by bumping it while getting on
his tractor in [**9-26**] and developed a wound.  He was diagnosed
with cellulitis and treated with Keflex for 2 weeks with no
improvement.  The wound was later debrided three times by
vascular surgery at [**Hospital3 **] but still did not improve.
He was then admitted in late [**Month (only) 404**]/early [**Month (only) 956**] to [**Hospital **] with L leg necrotic areas.  Biopsy revealed a
thrombotic embolic process and he was started on vanco and
ceftaz.
.
He was transfused several units PRBC for anemia. Blood cultures
then returned with gram + bacteria and he was switched to
Unasyn.  The patient was then noted to become jaundiced with
total bili 5.2 and direct bili 3.8.  GI was consulted.  RUQ U/S
revealed multiple stones.  ERCP showed no stones in the ducts.
LFTs remained elevated.  HCV antibody was positive, but viral
load negative.  Cryoglobulins were checked on a previous
admission (due to concern for vasculitis) but were negative.
The patient was eventually discharged home on oral antibiotics
for outpatient wound care.
.
Within one week, his leg again became enlarged and swollen and
the patient was referred to the ED and admitted on [**2101-12-30**] with R
leg cellulitis and necrotic areas of the L leg.  He was started
on Kefzol and DVT was ruled out.  Cultures of the leg came back
positive for MRSA.  Question of coumadin skin necrosis was
raised, but then felt unlikely as pt had been on coumadin for 5
years.  Per OSH notes, transfer to a tertiary care center was
first considered on [**1-2**] for plastic surgery management of LE
wounds.
.
Amiodarone was discontinued due to elevated LFTs.  Ammonia level
was in the 60s and lactulose was started. Of note, the patient
also developed hypoglycemia, believed to be due to oral DM meds.
 This improved when meds were held and D5W or D10W were given.
The patient then developed hyponatremia that was felt due to
these hypotonic fluids.  Nephrology was consulted for ARF and
hyponatremia. They suggested increasing doses of lasix along
with albumin (pt's albumin level was 1.4 at this point) and
switching to D10NS.
.
On [**1-3**] the patient was noted to be wheezy.  Pulmonary was
consulted due to concern for an upper-airway lesion.  CT neck
showed now airway compromise.  Pulmonary felt that wheezing was
more likely than actual upper airway stridor.  PFTs and CT were
recommended.  Not clear if CT was done at that time, but CTA was
done on [**1-8**] and ruled out PE.  Did show a R base pna.  On [**1-6**]
the patient was apparently transferred to the ICU for a CHF
exacerbation. This is not well-documented in the notes, but the
family notes that the patient was increasingly SOB despite
increasing doses of lasix.  He was eventually put on a lasix
gtt.
.
According to the report given to the nurse, the patient has
undergone hemodialysis for the last 2 days ([**1-7**] & [**1-8**]), with
4.3L taken off yesterday and 5L today (this is not mentioned in
OSH records).  The patient reports feeling much better
respiratory-wise following dialysis.  Most recent ABG by report
was 7.34/48/69 on 2L nc.  Apparently hepatorenal syndrome has
been considered as the etiology for worsening renal failure.
Today ([**1-8**]), hct noted to be 24.4, and patietn was transfused
2U PRBC prior to transfer.
.
According to the family, the reasons for transfer to [**Hospital1 18**] (on
[**1-8**]) are for vascular vs. plastic surgery evaluation for his
legs, renal evalation for renal failure requiring HD, and liver
transplant team evaluation, although they are aware he is not a
transplant candidate at this time (obese and actively infected).

Abd US ([**2102-1-10**]): 1. Coarsened and slightly nodular echotexture
of the liver without focal liver lesions. Trace amount of
ascites. No varices. Splenomegaly. 2. Gallstones and gallbladder
sludge.
.
CXR ([**2102-1-9**]): 1. Left subclavian central line tip at distal
SVC/RA junction. No pneumothorax. 2. Patchy opacity at both
bases, question atelectasis versus infiltrate, in the setting of
low inspiratory volumes.
.
TTE-The left atrium is moderately dilated. The estimated right
atrial pressure is 0-5mmHg. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Free wall motion
could not be assessed. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased
transaortic gradient is likely related to high cardiac output.
No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild
(1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation is seen. There is severe pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

CT Lower extremities:
FINDINGS:
Extensive vascular calcifications are present throughout the
pelvis and lower extremities including several of the smaller
end arterioles.
Subcutaneous edema is present most notably about both knees as
well as both ankles. No focal fluid collections are identified,
however, evaluation for this entity is limited without
intravenous contrast.
