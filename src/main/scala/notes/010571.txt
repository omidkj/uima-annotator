Chief Complaint:
melanotic stools

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
EGD

History of Present Illness:
85yo male w/ h/o severe aortic stenosis (valve are 0.9cm2),
systolic CHF (EF 40%) and CAD (80% left main dz) transferred
from [**Hospital 27217**] Hospital with multiple black stools and an
11-point hematocrit drop. He has had 5-6 episodes of loose black
stools since 9pm last night. Per the patient, he began having
loose, tarry BMs 5-6 days ago during his previous admission. He
denies dizziness, chest pain, worsening shortness of breath or
abdominal pain, though he he is not a perfect historian. Per his
son, for the last 5 days he has been coughing up a lot of mucous
every morning, including about a nickel-sized blood clot.

On arrival to [**Hospital 27217**] Hosp his pulse was 70, BP 117/58. His
Trop was 0.23 (down from 0.25), INR 2.7, Cr 1.5 (baseline), Hct
28.4, WBC 6.5. He got 10mg Vit K, 2 units PRBC and 4 units FFP.
Hct went to 29.9. Head CT for a facial droop and AP CXR were
normal. He was hemodynamically stable. He was started on
octreotide and pantoprazole infusions and transferred here. He
got two units PRBC prior to transfer.

The patient was recently admitted to the cardiology service from
[**12-2**] to [**12-8**] with syncope. On arrival his HR was 150, and
syncope thought likely to be AVNRT he had in the setting of
narrow aortic valve area and systolic heart failure leading to
cerebral hypoperfusion and syncope. MRI brain negative for CVA.
Underwent AV nodal ablation. Echo showed severe aortic stenosis
and cath showed multivessal disease. Discharged on a lovenox
bridge to coumadin (b/c of h/o CVA) with plans for AVR and CABG
in the near future.

On the floor, patient is resting comfortably. He feels overall
weak, but denies pain. He does not remember having any past
EGDs.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 13060**] is an 85yo male w/ h/o severe aortic stenosis (valve
are 0.9cm2), systolic CHF (EF 40%) and [**Hospital **] transferred from
[**Hospital 27217**] Hospital with multiple black stools and an 11-point
hematocrit drop.

# GI Bleed: HCT drop from 37 to 28, now stable at 31 s/p 4units
pRBCs and 4units FFP given at the OSH. EGD done [**12-12**] showed 2
nonbleeding ulcers. Patient was treated with PPI gtt,
transitioned to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **], and then PO PPI.  Initially
anticoagulation was held, but when transferred to the floor
aspirin was restarted and two days prior to discharge coumadin
was restarted at home dose as pt's Hct had stabilized. Checked
Hpylori serology and gastrin, which showed negative h. pylori
and gastrin was pending at time of discharge.  Pt was discharged
on PO pantoprazole [**Hospital1 **].  He will need treatment for 6-8 weeks
for ulcers to fully heal.

# Critical AS/CAD: Given his 80% left main lesion and critical
aortic stenosis, pt was initially transfused to a goal hct of
>30.  On floor his Hct remained >30 and he was hemodynamically
stable. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (cardiac surgeon) aware of admission and
consulted.  He will follow up with c-surgery in [**Month (only) **] to
arrange for AVR at future date.
.
#. Atrial fibrillation: h/o Afib and CVA.  Pt was continued on
amiodorone.  His coumadin and metoprolol were initially held.
He remained in sinus rhythm.  On the floor his coumadin was
restarted 2 days before discharge and his metoprolol decreased
to metoprolol succinate 50mg daily. We discussed that at this
time he is not receiving a heparin/lovenox bridge due to his
recent massive upper GI bleed. We had a discussion regarding the
risk of bridging and GI bleed vs. the short-term increased risk
of CVA off of anticoagulation. He voiced an understanding of our
discussion and agreed with holding on lovenox and restarting his
coumadin for a goal INR of [**3-3**]. We discussed that the daily risk
of CVA is low and we would opt for a longer duration of PPI
therapy to promote ulcer healing prior to the therapuetic
anticoagulation.
.
#. CAD: continued on ASA and atorvastatin
