Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 425**]
Chief Complaint:
dyspnea on exertion, lower extremity edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
cardiac catheterization

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 487**] is a 78yo woman with h/o AFib on coumadin and CHF
with unknown EF who presents with dyspnea and LE edema.
.
She presented to her cardiologist on [**8-1**] for regular follow-up
visit.  She reported a several month history of worsening
dyspnea on exertion.  She used to be able to mow her lawn and
run the snow-blower.  This winter, she felt she wasn't getting
enough air and so stopped running the snow-blower.  Now she has
to stop 3 times when she walks up the incline from her driveway.
 Her cardiologist ordered a chest CT and called her the next day
to return to his office for an echocardiogram.  Per report from
the ED, the TTE demonstrated pericardial effusion without
evidence of tamponade.  There was concern that tamponade
physiology might be masked by her pulmonary hypertension.  He
sent her to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation.
.
In the ED, initial VS were 99.4   76   159/74   18   98% RA.
She was noted to have elevated JVD.  Because of INR elevated to
4.5, she received Vitamin K 10mg PO x 1.  FFP was ordered but
she did not receive it prior to admission to CCU.
.
Upon presentation to the CCU, she was comfortable without
complaint other than feeling somewhat tired.
.
ROS as discussed above.  Of note, she presented to OSH ED about
3 weeks ago (around the time of a root canal) with feeling as
though "someone was sitting on my chest."  They kept her there
for a few hours and sent her home.  She did not receive any
antibiotics around the time of the procedure.  She denies any
h/o GI bleed; she has not had any bloody or black BMs.
.
She denies any known TB contacts.  [**Name (NI) **] exposure to homeless
people, no foreign travel.  Has chronic cough x 2 years for
which she was recently given Z-pack without any help.  No other
symptoms of URI.

Pertinent Results:
TTE [**2112-8-3**]:
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%).
Mild to moderate ([**1-20**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
to severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
moderate sized pericardial effusion. No right atrial or right
ventricular diastolic collapse is seen. Echocardiographic signs
of tamponade may be absent in the presence of elevated right
sided pressures.

Cardiac catheterization [**2112-8-4**]:
-LMCA, LAD, LCX, and RCA were without angiographically apparent
flow-limiting disease
-Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP of 17 mm Hg and LVEDP of 20 mm Hg.  There
was
moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension of 50/10 mm Hg.  There
was
moderate systemic arterial hypertension of 151/72 mm Hg.  The
cardiac
index was preserved at 2.4 l/min/m2.  There was no gradient upon

pullback of the catheter from LV to the aorta.
-Left ventriculography revealed mild mitral regurgitation with a

normal left ventricular ejection fraction of 65%.  There were no
wall
motion abnormalities.

Brief Hospital Course:
78yo woman with h/o diastolic heart failure, pulmonary HTN, and
longstanding dyspnea on exertion found to have pericardial
effusion. No echocardiographic evidence of tamponade and pulsus
of 12, yet does not have respiratory variation of her elevated
neck veins. She is hemodynamically stable at present. Note that
evidence of tamponade could be masked by elevated right-sided
pressures secondary to her pulmonary HTN.
.
# Pericardial effusion:
Pt did not have any echocardiographic evidence of tamponade. Her
pericardial effusion had an unclear chronicity and etiology. She
denied recent viral prodromes or TB risk factors. No recent
trauma or procedure. TSH normal, Rheum. Factor also normal, [**Doctor First Name **]
negative. Outside hospital chest CT showed "large pericardial
effusion," "coronary artery calcification," left and right
atrial enlargement, and a possible "diverticulum" or
"pericardial lymph node" adjacent to the right pericardium.
Pericardiocentesis was planned, but on TTE at [**Hospital1 18**] a moderate
sized circumferential pericardial effusion most prominent
inferior and inferolateral to the left ventricle was found that
was determined to be too inferior for pericardiocentesis. On
cardiac catheterization there was no evidence of hemodynamic
compromise due to tamponade physiology.
.
#  CAD:  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant
system
revealed no angiographically apparent coronary artery disease.
The
LMCA, LAD, LCX, and RCA were without angiographically apparent
flow-limiting disease.
.
# Valves:  On TTE the mitral leaflets appeared structurally
normal.  There was no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation was seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid
regurgitation was seen.
.
# Pump:  On cardiac catheterization, left ventriculography
revealed mild mitral regurgitation with anormal left ventricular
ejection fraction of 65%.  There were no wall motion
abnormalities.
.
# Pulmonary hypertension: On cardiac catheterization resting
hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left sided filling
pressures with RVEDP of 17 mm Hg and LVEDP of 20 mm Hg.  There
was moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension of 50/10 mm Hg. A
nutrition consult was requested to assist patient with following
a low-salt diet. The patient was restarted on Lasix. Patient
will have outpatient PFTs.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Coumadin was held initially given the
patient's elevated INR and the plan for pericardiocentesis.
Following the TTE and cardiac catheterization the patient was
restarted on coumadin and diltiazem for rate control.  The
patient was monitored on telemetry.
.
# Hypertension:  The patient's blood pressure tolerated
