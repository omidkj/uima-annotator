[**2152-6-7**] Cardiac Catheterization
1.  Coronary angiography in this right-dominant system revealed
three-vessel disease:
--the LMCA had no angiographically apparent disease.
--the LAD had diffuse 80% stenosis in its mid-portion.  D1 was a
very
large vessel wrapping around the lateral wall, with an ostial
80%
stenosis.
--the LCX had an 80% proximal stenosis
--the RCA was occluded in its mid-portion and fills by
right-to-right
and left-to-right collaterals.
2.  Resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right- and left-sided
filling
pressures with RVEDP 10 mmHg and LVEDP 26 mmHg.  There was
moderate
pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 59 mmHg.  The cardiac
output
was low-normal with CI 2.1 L/min/m2.  The PCWP was elevated at
26 mmHg.
There was mild systemic arterial systolic hypertension with SBP
145
mmHg.  There was no gradient across the aortic valve upon
pullback of
the angled pigtail catheter from LV to ascending aorta.
[**2152-6-8**] Carotid Ultrasound: Bilateral less than 40% carotid
stenosis.
[**2152-6-8**] Echocardiogram: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated. There
is severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
near-akinesis of the inferior/inferolateral walls. There is
moderate-to-severe hypokinesis of the remaining segments (LVEF =
20%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral
valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.
There is no pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted under cardiology and [**Known lastname 1834**] cardiac
catheterization which revealed severe three vessel coronary
artery disease with moderate to severe pulmonary
hypertension(see result section). Cardiac surgery was consulted
and further evaluation was performed. Carotid ultrasound found
no significant disease of the internal carotid arteries. Repeat
echocardiogram was notable for an LVEF of 20% with mild mitral
regurgitation(see result section). Post catheterization, he had
a slight decline in renal function and his ACE inhibitor was
discontinued. His preoperative creatinine peaked to 1.7.
Creatinine just prior to surgery was 1.5. Preoperative course
was also notable for bouts of paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation/flutter for which he was maintained on intravenous
Heparin.

On [**6-14**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1834**] coronary artery bypass
grafting and a mitral valve repair by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. For surgical
details, please see separate dictated operative note. Following
the operation, he was brought to the CVICU for invasive
monitoring. On postoperative day one, sedation was weaned and he
was extubated. However, due to severe agitation and confusion
associated with atrial fibrillation and low mixed venous
saturations, he was electively reintubated. While intubated and
sedated, cardioversion was performed but unsuccessful. He was
also given several units of PRBCs. On postoperative day three,
he self-extubated. He did not required reintubation but was
initially maintained on 100% shovel mask. Despite medical
therapy and multiple cardioversions, he continued to experience
atrial fibrillation. Given atrial fibrillation, he was
eventually started on Amiodarone and Warfarin. He temporarily
required a Heparin bridge. Postoperative renal function remained
relatively stable. His confusion and agitation gradually
improved with use of haldol. On [**2152-6-20**], Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. He
continued to be gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight.
The physical therapy service worked with him daily to increase
his strength and mobility. Keflex was started for mild
incisional erythema. An ace inhibitor was started given his low
preoperative ejection fraction. Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to make
steady progress and was discharged to Baypoint of [**Hospital1 1474**]. Dr. [**Name (NI) 38327**] coumadin clinic will assume management of his coumadin
dosing after discharge from rehabilitation. His goal INR is
2.0-2.5. He will also follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and Dr.
[**Last Name (un) **]. Amiodarone will be tapered to 200mg once daily.
