Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1974**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none.


History of Present Illness:
89 year old female with history CHF(EF 40%), MI([**12-18**]- medically
managed), chronic hyponatremia who presents from nursing home
with hypotension, hypoxia, and progressive cough x 2 weeks. No
clear history of aspiration, but pt eats pureed food. No
fever/chills, 88% on RA at nursing home, 89% on RA on arrival to
ED, 99% on 3L NC.
In ED afebrile, BP initially 99/60, dropped to 79/50, improved
to 106/70 with 2L NS bolus. Patient CXR was consitent with
pulmonary edema. She was given dose of levofloxacin, cefepime,
and clinda for possible aspiration PNA. She uderwent CTA chest
in the ED which showed multiple segmental and subsegmental
pulmonary emboli in the bilateral lower lobes and patient was
started on IV heparin and admitted to the ICU. Also in the ED
patient was noted to be hyponatremic with Na of 122, her Na on
previous admission has been ranged from 122-128. Cortisol was
sent in the ED.
.
ROS: Denies any HA, chest pain, currently no SOB, denies any
abdominal pain. Patient states she feels weak. Admits to recent
weight loss. States her heels hurt her.


Past Medical History:
Hypertension
S/P hysterectomy
Iron deficiency anemia
Basal cell carcinomas (largest on scalp; patient refuses to have
treated per PCP)
Recent MI [**12-18**] medically managed
CHF most recent echo with LVEF 40%
Critical AS: Peak velocity 4.0 and valve area of 0.5
Rectal mass (no workup)


Social History:
Pt previously lived alone but most recently from rehab.  Nephew
is HCP.  She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She previously
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 98190**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 23081**]. The patient does not have any family; her
nephew does not see her often. She has no children.

.
CHEST CT:
1. Multiple segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the
lower lobes bilaterally.
2. Diffuse small pulmonary nodules, most conspicuous in the
lower lobes. Some are relatively ill defined, but others are
well circumscribed. Differential considerations include
neoplastic, infectious, and inflammatory etiologies. Followup
with chest CT in [**2-20**] months time after acute symptoms resolve
would be standard. Index of suspicion for underlying malignancy
should guide the decision on the time interval to rescan.
3. More organized areas of consolidation, particularly in the
right lower lobe could represent focal areas of infection, but
peripheral consolidations in the left lower lobe could also
represent infarction associated with pulmonary emboli.
4. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
5. Extensive vascular calcifications in the coronary arteries
and mitral and aortic valves.
6. Moderate hiatal hernia.
7. Left kidney cysts, one of which appears hyperdense. These are
incompletely imaged on this study. Furhter evaluation with
ultrasound may be pursued if indicated.
.
ECG:
Sinus rhythm
Atrial premature complex
Left anterior fascicular block
Probable left ventricular hypertrophy
Delayed R wave progression - may be left ventricular hypertrophy
or possible
prior anterior myocardial infarction
ST-T wave abnormalities - could be left ventricular hypertrophy
Clinical correlation is suggested
Since previous tracing of [**2119-1-15**], no significant change


Brief Hospital Course:
1) Hypoxia:
The patient has multiple subsegmental PEs seen on CTA last
night. However, as she improved so much in only 18 hours (did
receive heparin drip), it is unlikely that PEs were causing
symptoms.  After discussion between ICU team and HCP, it was
decided not to continue anticoagulation given risks (ie known
rectal mass). Aspiration PNA was also likely contributing to her
hypoxia as there was some evidence of consolidation on chest CT.
 She was initially on abx, then stopped, but restarted with
levaquin upon review of this CT.  Though CHF may have been a
small part of her hypoxia, given that her hypoxia resolved
without diuresis, this is less likely.
.
In addition, chest CT showed multiple pulmonary nodules which
had a broad ddx.  Although malignancy is possible, since pt does
not want any further workup, this can be followed with serial
imaging in [**2-14**] months.
.
2) Hypotension:
Patient noted to be hypotensive in nursing home and ED, she
responded well to IVF. Hypotension likely from volume depletion
as she responded well to IVF overnight. Other etiology of
hypotension could be from PE but this is unlikely given patient
does not appear to have large central PE on CT scan.  Cortisol
levels normal so unlikely to be adrenally insufficient.  Her
anti HTN will need to be slowly restarted.
.
3) Hyponatremia:
Patient with chronic hyponatremia. On previous admission her Na
was 122 and improved to 128 after diuresis, felt hyponatremia
secondary to volume overload.  On this admission, sodium
improved with IVF so likely hypovolemic component.  Stabilized
around 127 to 128 which is her baseline.
.
4) Cardiac;
Patient with recent STEMI in [**12-18**] that was medically managed.
Also patient with CHF and LVEF of 40%.  Continued aspirin 325mg.
 Once hypotension resolved, restarted beta blocker at low dose
atenolol 12.5 mg daily.  As BP held stable, furosemide also
restarted.  She did not have any significant clinical volume
overload though BNP was elevated.  ACE-I held as was
hyperkalemic but will need to be restarted in next several days
if BP remains stable and hyperkalemia resovles.
.
4) Pressure Ulcers:
Wound care for ulcer on RLE, waffle boots for heels sores.
.
5) FEN:
Patient evaluated in past by speech and swallow, Pureed diet,
pills whole with thin liquids. Fluid restrict given CHF.
Hyperkalemic to 5.4--this will decrease as lasix is restarted.
K should be checked every 1-2 days for next several days.
