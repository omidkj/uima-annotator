HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old
male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post
inferior wall myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, and anal cell carcinoma, who was admitted
to the MICU for respiratory distress.  The patient presented
on the day of admission to the [**Hospital6 2018**] electively for radiation treatment and was noted to be
very tachypneic in the 30s and was sent to the Emergency
Room.

In the Emergency Room, the patient's respiratory rate was
confirmed in the 30s with oxygen saturation about 80% to 100%
on non-rebreather.  ABG on 8 L was 7.42, 30, and 43.  Chest
x-ray showed ................. redistribution, but overall
was poor quality.  The patient denied chest pain, cough,
fever or increasing lower extremity swelling.
Electrocardiogram revealed right bundle branch block, left
anterior descending Q-waves in inferior leads, which per Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was old.  The patient received 40 mg intravenous Lasix
with 1 L diuresis and improvement in oxygen saturation 90% on
100% non-rebreather.

The patient underwent CT angiogram, given concerns for PE.
Exam revealed no PE, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and mild congestive heart failure.  The patient was
sent to the Intensive Care Unit on 100% non-rebreather for
further care.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ................. carcinoma, status
post local resection, status post chemotherapy and radiation.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for which he takes
chronic steroids.  Status post myocardial infarction.  Right
below-the-knee amputation.  He suffers from diabetes mellitus
and is Insulin dependent.  Schizophrenia.

ALLERGIES:  NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Prednisone 10 once a day, Aspirin
325 once a day, Zyprexa 5 q.h.s., Isosorbide Nitrate 30 mg 3
times a day, Metoprolol 50 mg 3 times a day, Prilosec 20

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has a 40-year tobacco history.
He is a former drinker.  He is a resident of the [**Hospital **]
Healthcare Center.  He is a former accountant.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General:  The patient was a
middle-aged, heavy-set gentleman.  He was tachypneic while
sitting up in the chair.  Vital signs:  Temperature 99.6??????,
blood pressure 105/60, heart rate 95-100, respirations 26-30,
oxygen saturation 88% to 90% non-rebreather.  HEENT:  Pupils
equal, round and reactive to light.  No scleral icterus.
Oropharynx clear.  Neck:  Supple.  Difficult to assess JVP.
Chest:  Poor air movement.  No wheezing.  No crackles.
Distant heart sounds.  Tachycardia.  No murmur was
appreciated.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft, nontender and
nondistended.  The patient had severe radiation changes of
the skin across the buttocks and scrotum.  Extremities:  Warm
with 1+ edema.  Poor left pedal pulse.

LABORATORY DATA:  Chest x-ray and CT angiogram as previously
described.

White count 8.5, hematocrit 49.4, platelet count 160,000;
CHEM7 unremarkable; ABG as described.

Electrocardiogram as described.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the MICU where
he was observed overnight.  He did well on 100%
non-rebreather and was treated initially with high-dose
steroids for presumed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
flare and was started on Levaquin.  The patient was
transferred out to the floor on 16th.  His hospital course
was notable for resolution of his obstructive component of
lung disease with steroids.

The patient initially continued radiation treatment, but
given his considerable skin changes and breakdown secondary
to radiation, it was held for one week to allow for healing.
On the 20th of the month, he was transferred to the Oncology
Service for continuation of his treatment of his anal
carcinoma.  His course was unremarkable.  He received 5FU and
Mitomycin.  He continued to have resolution of his chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease flare, and a steroid taper was
begun.  He was brought to his baseline oxygen requirement of
about 6 L/min by nasal cannula.  With skin care, the scrotal
skin breakdown and erythema resolved, and the patient was
restarted on his radiation therapy on [**4-20**].

He was transferred back to this home on [**4-20**] in stable
condition with his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
flare having resolved and with radiation treatment ensuing
for his anal carcinoma.  He is now status post 5FU and

Mitomycin treatment and is doing well with no noticeable side
affects from the 5FU.  He continued to eat well and had no
other difficulties.

Given the severity of his chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and the flare, his beta-blocker was stopped and will
be restarted given the tenuousness of his pulmonary
condition.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare.
2.  Anal cancer.
3.  Coronary artery disease.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISPOSITION:  He will be discharged to [**Hospital **] Healthcare
