History of Present Illness:
62 year old man with COPD on home O2, Type II DM, and obesity in
his usual state of health at the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] center for a follow up
visit. He dropped his oxygen tank and felt it did not work
properly after he picked it up. He sat down and does not
remember the following events until he was in the ED. He denies
chest pain, lightheadedness, abdominal pain, weakness prior to
this. Over the last few days he does note that his sputum has
been thicker and more difficult to clear but denies any changes
in his breathing. He was found down cyanotic and pulseless, not
breathing, CPR was administered for 2 min before he regained a
pulse. The monitor showed HR 30s, SBP 60, was given 1mg Atropine
and 250 ml NS, with HR 150s sinus tach, SBP 120. Airway was
difficult to intubate, attempt was made, but patient was not
intubated on [**Hospital Ward Name **], was bagged. He started spontaneously
moving his right arm and spontaneously breathing. He was not
recoiling to pain or responding to voice. He was sent to ED
because there were no beds in the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**].
.
In the ED his vitals were T 97.6, HR 127, BP 212/89, RR 22, O2
sat 93%
An ekg showed new afib 120 [**3-18**] atropine?-new sinus
CXR showed-Stable appearance of chronic lung disease with
prominent
interstitial markings. Slight interval increase in engorgement
of pulmonary vasculature.
CTA showed no pulmonary embolism or acute aortic abnormalities.
Small airspace consolidation of the left lung base likely
represents aspiration in the setting of recent cardiac arrest.
Bibasilar
atelectasis and Emphysema.
He was given combivent nebs times three, prednisone 60mg,
ceftriaxone, azithro as well as morphine
Cards was called to evaluate him and thought it was sinus tach,
not afib
lactate 7.2
.
On arrival to the MICU, he was satting in the mid-nineties on 3L
and stated he felt at his baseline. He complained of chest
soreness that was reproducible (likely secondary to CPR). He
remained on 3L NC.

[**2119-3-30**] CTA chest:
TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the
chest before and after the administration of intravenous
contrast material. Multiplanar reformatted images were also
obtained.

FINDINGS: The pulmonary arterial tree is well opacified and
there is no pulmonary embolism. There are no acute aortic
abnormalities. There is no pericardial effusion. Airspace
consolidation is noted in the left lower lobe, indicating
possible aspiration in the setting of recent cardiac arrest.
Dependent atelectasis is also seen bilaterally. Emphysematous
changes are seen bilaterally, most prominently at the apices.
The tracheobronchial tree is patent to subsegmental levels.
Multiple subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes are seen. There
is no hilar lymphadenopathy. While this examination is not
optimized for evaluation of the abdomen, limited images of the
upper abdomen are unremarkable.

Examination of osseous structures reveals minimal degenerative
disease of the thoracic spine. No suspicious lytic or blastic
lesions are identified.

IMPRESSION:
1. No pulmonary embolism or acute aortic abnormalities.
2. Small airspace consolidation of the left lung base likely
represents aspiration in the setting of recent cardiac arrest.
Bibasilar atelectasis.
3. Emphysema.

[**2119-3-30**] CXR:
AP UPRIGHT VIEW OF THE CHEST AT APPROXIMATELY 10:45 A.M.:
Prominent interstitial markings are unchanged in appearance from
prior radiograph, consistent with chronic lung disease. There is
no focal consolidation or pleural effusion. Mild enlargement of
the cardiac silhouette is stable. Pulmonary vasculature is
slightly engorged, without signs of overt edema. Soft tissue and
osseous structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of chronic lung disease with
prominent interstitial markings. Slight interval increase in
engorgement of pulmonary vasculature.

[**2119-3-30**] ECG:
Sinus tachycardia. The P-R interval is 160 milliseconds. There
is a late
transition which is probably normal. Non-specific ST-T wave
changes. Compared
to the previous tracing ST-T wave changes are now present.

[**2119-4-2**] CXR:
Cardiac size is top normal. Faint ill-defined peripheral
opacities in the lower lobes bilaterally are increasing and
worse on the right side. There is no pneumothorax. Atelectasis
is in the left lower lobe. There are no sizable pleural
effusions.

IMPRESSION: Worsening faint ill-defined basilar opacities
consistent with aspiration


Brief Hospital Course:
A&P: 62 yo male smoker with DMII, severe COPD (FEV1/FVC 43%
predicted) on home O2 presents after being unresponsive at a
routine visit to his NP.
.
# s/p unresponsiveness/pulseless arrest: Thought to be due to O2
tank malfunction/hypoxia. He was admitted to ICU and observed
overnight.  Telemetry unremarkable during this admission as well
as cardiac enzymes were negative.  CTA chest did not show any PE
but did show consolidation from aspiration.  Echo was done and
compared with the prior study on [**2119-3-2**], regional left
ventricular systolic dysfunction and mitral regurgitation were
not identified.  He was transferred to the floor in a stable
condition and repeat CXR on [**4-2**] showed worsening aspiration, so
levofloxacin and flagyl were started.  Pt was continued on all
his home meds
