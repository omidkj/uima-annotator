Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Mefoxin

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 759**]
Chief Complaint:
Hemoptysis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 42667**] is a very pleasant 46 yo man with Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome (type 4), h/o multiple lower GIB requiring
transfusions, s/p R colectomy for ischemia, carotid artery
aneurysms, who presented to an OSH with hemoptysis.
.
He was in his usual state of health on the morning of admission
when he had a 15-minute period of scant hemoptysis (~2
tablespoons of blood). He denied any chest pain or shortness of
breath.
.
At the OSH, he had a chest x-ray that demonstrated blunting of
the costophrneic angle, a normal Hct and a normal EKG. He was
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] for CTA out of concern for PE and the
likely management deciions that could ensue from the diagnosis.

.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, his initial VSs were HR 82, BP 110/70, RR 22,
97% 2LNC. His blood pressure remained stable (>115 systolic
throughout), and he was never tachycardic. CTA of the chest
demonstrated bilateral pulmonary embolism.
.
After discussion with [**Hospital1 1106**] surgery, the decision was made to
anticoagulate. The pt received a bolus of heparin (5,400 units)
and was started on a 1,200 unit/hr drip and sent to the ICU for
closer monitoring.
.
Upon arrival to the ICU, the pt denies chest pain, shortness of
breath or recurrent hemoptysis. He denies any recent travel or
illnesses. He denies recent surgery or immobilization.


Past Medical History:
- Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, type 4 ([**Hospital1 1106**] type) with GI
bleeding and multiple aneurysms
- multiple GI bleeds: 17 Unit bleed (rectal bleeding) in
[**11-1**], tagged scan +RUQ. CT scan showed extravasation of
contrast
at colon anastomosis. treated with DDAVP and bleeding eventually

stopped. Most recent lower GIB [**1-2**].
- h/o right colectomy for ischemic right colon
- s/p multiple SB resections
- short bowel syndrome
- h/o GERD
- Gallstones
- celiac artery aneurysm
- bilateral club feet, with ankle surgeries
- spontaneous RP bleed in [**2119**], no intervention
- HTN
- Left inguinal hernia repair
- h/o TIA w/ temporary Left eye blindness
- Bilateral carotid artery aneurysm, h/o bilateral carotid
artery thrombi (most recent [**Year (4 digits) 1106**] study only shows L ICA
thrombus)
- s/p bilateral ankle reconstructions

CTA chest: 1. Massive bilateral acute pulmonary embolism with no
CT evidence of right heart strain.
2. Focal consolidation at the mediastinal aspect of right upper
lobe. This
appearance is most likely related to focal atelectasis.
3. Unusual aneurysmal of the celiac trunk, with possible
dissection of the
common hepatic artery, unchanged, related to underlying
connective tissue
disease.

bilateral LE ultrasound: Left popliteal varix, likely related to
underlying Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, containing non-occlusive
thrombus, with no more central thrombus seen.

CXR: The heart size is normal. There is no change in the
mediastinal contours compared to the prior study. The lungs are
essentially clear. Right hemidiaphragm is elevated with adjacent
pleural thickening, findings are unchanged since [**2124-1-22**]. There is no evidence of failure as well as there is no
increase in pleural effusion or pneumothorax.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 42667**] is a 46yo Man with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (type 4),
h/o multiple lower GIB requiring transfusions, s/p R colectomy
for ischemia, carotid artery aneurysms, who presented with
hemoptysis and was found to have bilateral massive pulmonary
emboli as well as left poplieal nonocclusive DVT.
.
# Pulmonary embolism: This patient did not at any time have
clinical evidence of hemodynamic compromise or RV dysfunction.
There was no evidence of right heart strain on CT scan; troponin
of <0.1 and BNP of 79 placed him at low risk stratification.
LENIs demonstrated a L popliteal vein thrombus. Per [**Known lastname 1106**]
surgery ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 11805**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29316**]), the pt was not a candidate for IVC
filter given the risk of erosion into the vessel wall with his
underlying Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. He received a bolus (5,400
units) and infusion (1,200 units/hr) of heparin was begun in the
ED prior to transfer. He was continued on heparin gtt with goal
PTT of 50-70. Hct was stable during stay, and all stools were
guiac negative.  Before discharge he was seen by the hematology
team to discuss need for long term anticoagulation. They
recommended that the patient be discharged with four weeks of
lovenox 60mg sQ [**Hospital1 **], followed by 100mg lovenox SC qday for 8
weeks for a total of three months of anticoagulation. The
patient will call Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3060**] for an outpatient hematology
appointment during the next 1-2 months to discuss whether he
will need further work-up for etiology or prolonged
anticoagulation. Due to insurance limitations (they will only
pay in three week increments for lovenox) the patient was
discharged with lovenox 60mg sq [**Hospital1 **] for three weeks, followed by
100 mg sq qday for 9 weeks.  Prior to discharge his prescription
was called in to his local CVS and the pharmacist ordered this
to be delivered the following morning. He was given education
about self injection and gave himself one dose of lovenox
(overlapped by one hour with heparin drip) in the evening prior
to discharge.

The etiology of thromboembolism remained uncertain. The patient
reported a remote h/o injury to the posterior L knee resulting
in significant hematoma for which he did not seek medical help.
He has not been immobilized or undergone surgery. He does not
have a history of malignancy, and he has had no recent trauma to
the L leg.

He will call his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) **] for additional follow up,
including ordering an echocardiogram to evaluate for right heart
strain at a local hospital, as it is difficult for him to come
to [**Location (un) 86**].
.
# HTN - His HTN was well controlled at the time of admission on
metropolol XL 50mg PO BID and valsartan. During his hospital
stay, his SBP remained <120. It is very important to control his
BP given his h/o aneurysms. He will be discharged on his same
home regimen of metropolol and valsartan.
.
# Anxiety - the patient was kept on his usual ativan prn anxiety
throughout his stay without further problem.
.
# chronic pain - the patient was kept on his usual percocet prn
pain throughout his stay without further problem.
.
# gallstones - the patient was kept on his usual ursodiol
throughout his stay without further problem.
