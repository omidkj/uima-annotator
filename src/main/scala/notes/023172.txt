CXR: PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH: The lungs are clear. The
pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. No pleural
effusions or pneumothorax is seen. The soft tissue and osseous
structures are stable.
.
CT chest/abd/pelvis: FINDINGS:
Consolidation is present at both lung bases, involving a small
portion of the lateral and posterior basal segments on the left,
and minimal involvement in the posterior basal segment on the
right. The distribution suggests aspiration as a possible cause;
there are no features to suggest that this is anything other
than bacterial pneumonia. Central lymph nodes are numerous
ranging in size up to 8 mm in the left lower paratracheal
station and the subcarinal space as well as well as many smaller
nodes in both axillae. Thymus is physiologic. There is no
pleural effusion.

This study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis.
.
CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: No intracranial hemorrhage or mass
effect is identified. The ventricles are symmetric, and there is
no shift of normally midline structures. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter
differentiation is preserved. The osseous structures are normal.
Partial opacification of posterior ethmoid air cells and the
left sphenoid sinus is noted.


Brief Hospital Course:
43yo male h/o AIDS/HIV, ?mild dementia, Hep C admit after
cocaine use with myalgias and hypoxia, ?aspiration PNA.  Also
sinus inflammation.  Patient initially admitted to MICU for
question of early sepsis with elevated lactate.  Never required

TB with 3 negative AFBs.  Transferred to floor and on arrival
announced wanting to leave the hospital.  No firm reasons to
stay longer so discharged and encouraged strongly to arrange
follow up.
.

higher risk strep infection.

after treatment of infection.
.

improved with hydration.  Encouraged patient to get help for
