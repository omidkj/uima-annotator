Attending:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4659**]
Chief Complaint:
altered mental status

History of Present Illness:
HPI: Mr. [**Known lastname 4542**] is an 80 y/o man with PMH notable for ESRD on HD
and recent SDH s/p Burr hole sent to the ED for altered mental
status. He was at his nursing home and found to have altered
mental status at 8:30 am. At that time, T 96.5, P 123, BP
120/70, RR 40, 93% on NRB and 88% on NC (later reported 83% on
RA). He was diaphoretic at the time FSBS 145. Per NH reports, he
had dialysis on [**10-13**]. He was sent to the [**Hospital 1474**] Hospital
emergency room for further evaluation. There, he was noted to
have a rectal temp 100.7, RR 30, P 117, and BP 112/90. His O2
sat was 98% on NRB. CXR showed left base atelectasis versus
infiltrate; CT head demonstrated SDH and he was then transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation with neurosurgery.
.
In the ED, initial vitals BP 85/48, HR 110, RR 24, 100% on NRB.
He was found to be hyperkalemic and received calcium gluconate,
D50/insulin. Due to decreased mental status, he was intubated
with 20 mg etomidate and 40 mg rocuronium. He was hypotensive to
the 70s/50s and started on levophed gtt. Right femoral CVL was
placed for IV access. He was noted to have dark brown output
(400 cc in total) from his NGT. He received 2 U FFP and vitamin
K as well as profilin (activated factor 9). He received
vancomycin 1 g X 1 and zosyn.
On arrival to the ICU, the patient he was intubated and sedated
with markedly distended abdomen.

CT head ([**10-14**]): FINDINGS: Again demonstrated is a hypodense left
subdural collection, not significantly changed in size. There
has been interval decrease in the amount of pneumocephalus and
rightward shift of midline structures, now measuring 4 mm. There
is overall less edema and mass effect, as the sulci are better
defined on this study. There is no intraparenchymal hemorrhage
or right extra- axial collection. Basal cisterns are patent.
Burr holes within the left frontal and parietal calvarium are
unchanged. IMPRESSION: Left subdural collection, unchanged in
size, with slight decrease in rightward shift of midline
structures and sulcal effacement.

CT thorax ([**10-14**]):LUNG BASES: There are small bilateral pleural
effusions, with associated atelectasis. Pacer wires are
incompletely imaged on this study. Median sternotomy and
surgical clips are consistent with history of CABG. There is no
pericardial effusion. CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS
CONTRAST: The liver, gallbladder, spleen, and adrenals are
normal. The kidneys are atrophic, with multiple vascular
calcifications, unchanged. Pancreas is atrophic. Nasogastric
tube terminates just distal to the gastroesophageal junction.
There is fluid within the dependent portion of the esophagus
(2:4). Small bowel is unremarkable. The colon diffusely is
markedly distended, measuring up to 7.7 cm in diameter, and
contains a large amount of fecal material, particularly in the
rectum. There is no pneumatosis, bowel wall thickening, or
abnormal bowel wall enhancement. There is no free fluid or free
air within the abdomen. There is no mesenteric or
retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The aorta demonstrates marked
atherosclerotic calcifications and noncalcified
ulcerative plaques. The origins of the celiac axis and superior
mesenteric
artery are calcified but patent. The inferior mesenteric artery
which arises from the aortic aneurysm, does not opacify.
Infrarenal aortic aneurysm, measuring up to 4.5 cm in diameter,
is stable and demonstrates peripheral thrombus. The iliac
arteries are heavily calcified but patent as visualized. CT OF
THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is significant
amount of fecal material throughout the colon. The rectum is
distended with stool. There is a Foley catheter within the
urinary bladder, with air in the non-dependent portion of the
urinary bladder. There is no free pelvic fluid, and no pelvic or
inguinal lymphadenopathy.
BONE WINDOWS: There are multilevel degenerative changes of the
lumbar spine and calcified intervertebral discs of the
thoracolumbar junction.
IMPRESSION:
1. No secondary signs of bowel ischemia.
2. The inferior mesenteric artery does not opacify, and
originates from the
infrarenal aortic aneurysm. The celiac axis and superior
mesenteric artery
are heavily calcified but patent.
3. Stable infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, measuring up to
4.5 cm in
diameter, and demonstrating peripheral thrombus.
4. Distended colon measuring up to 7.7 cm, containing abundant
amount of
fecal material.

EKG: afib ~105. IVCD. LAD. no ischemic changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 80 y/o man with ESRD on HD and SDH s/p recent evacuation
per NSG admitted with altered mental status.
.
# Shock, likely septic in etiology: Potential sources include
urine (though only 6-10 WBCs with culture pending) and
intra-abdominal. Should also consider CNS source with recent
instrumentation. Of these most concerning would be mesenteric
ischemia secondary to atrial fibrillation
- aggressive volume repletion to CVP 10-12
- continue vasopressors as necessary
- surgery consult for acute abdomen
- broad spectrum antibiotics

Surgical consult revealed a massively distended, diffusely
tender abdomen with increase tenderness in left lower quadrant
with guarding and rebound tenderness.  His lactate level was 8
and he was hemodynamically unstable.  I discussion was held with
his 3 children.  The very poor prognosis, even with surgical
intervention was conveyed to them, but they wished to proceed
with an exploratory laparotomy.

The patient was found to have a completely necrotic sigmoid
co
