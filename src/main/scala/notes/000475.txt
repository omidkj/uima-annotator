Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 148**]
Chief Complaint:
Acute pancreatitis


Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Per OSh report (as patient is intubated and sedated on
arrival to [**Hospital1 18**]) 57F with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain,
nausea, and vomitting ove the at least the past several months.
Would only last < 12 hours at each time with epigastric pain,
radiating to the back. No prior evidence of gallstones on
abdominal ultrasounds. She presented witha similar episode to
[**Hospital6 **] on [**2132-1-5**] but with very severe pain
and an episode of diarrhea. She had been afebrile, tender in
epigastric area, with admission labs of lipase > 3500, amylase
>1100, AST 428 AP 153 ALT 327 TB 1.5 Lactate 4.0 Cr 1.0 WBC
22.6,
BE 9.1. CT at the time just showed acute pancreatitis, and was
given a presumptive diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis based on
history and labs. Transferred to the ICu that day and
subsequently intubated for worsening respiratory distress. The
patient then spiked a fever, had positive blood cultures, and
started on antibiotics. At some pont she was on pressors which
have since been dicontinued. For nutrition got TPN for a few
days, then enteral feeding, which is now stopped to due to
vomitting yesterday. Had ERCP with sphinctertomy done before
transfer; all biliary ducts filled normally as well as duodenum.
WBC decreased and then began to [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 7162**], 35.6 on transfer. Pab

culture [**1-4**] & 16 Klebsiella. OSH CT scans demonstrate no signs
of gas aroudn the pancreas, just extensive edema and
nonenhancement with some necrosis.

[**Hospital1 18**] ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY REPORT
GENERAL COMMENTS: The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm.
Left pleural effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Preserved [**Hospital1 **]-ventricular systolic function. No
evidence of vegitation on the aortic or mitral valves.

Radiology Report CT CHEST W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2132-1-15**]
12:33 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. Necrotizing pancreatitis involving greater than two-thirds of
the
pancreas. CT severity index is [**9-1**] .
2. Large acute fluid collection extending superiorly around the
gastric
fundus.
3. Splenic vein thrombosis, with development of collateral flow
through a
prominent left gastroepiploic vein.
4. No pseudoaneurysm identified.
6. Multifocal ground glass and airspace consolidations
consistent with
multifocal pneumonia.
7. Prominent right mammary lymph node. Correlation with
mammography or
history of breast cancer is recommended. This finding was
entered into the
radiology critical results reporting system on [**2132-1-16**].
8. Fatty infiltration of the liver.

Radiology Report CT PELVIS W/CONTRAST Study Date of [**2132-1-25**]
12:48 PM
IMPRESSION:
1. Progressively enlarging pancreatic collections and
peripancreatic fluid in
the setting of extensive pancreatic necrosis.
2. Gas within the gallbladder lumen, wich would be expected
following
instrumentation (ie. ERCP) though no documentation is on the OMR
at time of
dication. Differential would also include cholecystitis due to
gas-forming
organism. 3. Improved right pleural effusion and resolved
abdominal ascites.




Brief Hospital Course:
57 obese female with severe necrotizing pancreatitis, developing
pseudocyst, intubated for almost 10 days with respiratory
failure. No signs of gas on
CT scan, pseudoaneursym or erosion into blood vessels. We will
keep the patient intubated and sedated, likely bronch/BAL,
introduce nutrition via enteral feeds after
reassessment, continue antibiotics for positive blood cultures,
urine culture, and presumptive pneumonias.
