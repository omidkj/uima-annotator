HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 1637**] is a 69 year old
female with a history of coronary artery disease status post
coronary artery bypass graft following a non-ST elevation
myocardial infarction in [**2124-1-1**], and also history
of type I diabetes, presenting with unstable angina. The
patient had done well from coronary artery bypass graft until
[**2124-10-30**] when she began to experience angina again.
She was taken to the catheterization laboratory at that point
where she was found to have left anterior descending lesions
which were not amenable to intervention at that time and the
case was complicated by two dissections. Following that the
patient had an escalated pattern of angina until 2 days prior
to admission when the patient experienced angina at rest. Her
angina is experienced as a chest heaviness with pain
radiating to the left arm.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2123**] wit saphenous vein graft to patent
ductus arteriosus and saphenous vein graft to left anterior
descending, left internal mammary artery to diagonal,
saphenous vein graft to an OM. Catheterization on [**11-2**]
showed stump occlusion of saphenous vein graft to the left
anterior descending with failed intervention, stump occlusion
saphenous vein graft to the patent ductus arteriosus, patent
left internal mammary artery to the diagonal and patent
saphenous vein graft to the OM.
2.  Type 1 diabetes mellitus.
3.  IgG Monoclonal gammopathy.
4.  Osteoporosis.
5.  Status post TH for leiomyoma.
6.  Hypertension.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Actonel 35 mg po q week.
2.  Aspirin 81 mg po once daily.
3.  Insulin NPH 18 units in the morning and 8 units in the
evening. Regular insulin 8 units in the morning and 2 units
at dinner.
4.  Imdur 30 mg three times a day.
5.  Lipitor 10 mg po once daily.
6.  Lisinopril 40 mg po once daily.
7.  Metformin 500 mg po twice a day
8.  Plavix 75 mg po once daily
9.  Toprol-XL 50 mg po once daily

ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives alone in [**Location (un) 3307**].  No tobacco,
alcohol or drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.9, blood pressure 94/33, pulse
60, respiratory rate 16, saturating at 99 percent on room
air.
LUNGS: Clear.
HEART:  Unremarkable without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
EXTREMITY:  She had no lower extremity edema.

LABORATORY DATA: On admission laboratory data was notable for
sodium of 132, glucose of 272, normal creatinine, normal
coags, and normal CK with a troponin of 0.02.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Cardiovascular:  The patient underwent cardiac
catheterization on [**1-22**] initially which demonstrated
20 percent left main left anterior descending calcified with
95 percent osteal stenosis in the mid and distal vessel
within the distal left anterior descending, circumflex had
diffuse disease with 60 percent osteal stenosis and 80
percent long stenosis between the OM2 and OM3, right coronary
artery had moderate degree disease and saphenous vein graft
to OM2 was widely patent but with severe disease again
between the OM2 and OM3. She had a hepico stent deployed in
the mid left anterior descending but the distal left anterior
descending was small and diffusely diseased and not amenable
to stenting. She had following that an episode of nausea, and
the next morning had recurrent episode of chest pain
radiating to the left arm. Electrocardiogram showed slight ST
elevations in V2, V3 with inverted T waves in V4, V5, V6, and
the patient was hypotensive to the 70's.  The patient had no
sign or symptoms of congestive heart failure while in
hospital.  She was treated with 20 mg of Lasix po once daily
and given her orthostasis until the day prior to discharge
she had persistent low blood pressure. On the day of
discharge her Lasix was discontinued.

She was taken back to the cardiac catheterization laboratory
where the stent into the left anterior descending was opened
but there was again diffuse vessel disease. Another stent was
deployed within that previously patent stent. Also the
patient was noted to have a decreased cardiac index at 1.98
and to be profoundly acidotic.

An intraaortic balloon pump was placed after administration
of Dopamine. She was noted to have decreased ejection
fraction of approximately 30 percent. The patient was
transferred to the CCU where she was found to have ketones
and determined to be in diabetic ketoacidosis.  The pressors
were aptly weaned off.  The balloon pump was weaned within 24
hours. The patient was transported back to the floor.  Of
note the patient had CK pump to the 700s following a second
event and repeat echocardiogram demonstrated new ejection
fraction of approximately 25 percent. Thereafter the patient
remained chest pain free while in house, however her blood
pressure remained tenuous and she was orthostatic until the
day of discharge. For that reason her beta blocker and ACE
inhibitor were decreased to 12.5 mg of atenolol and 2.5 mg of
lisinopril.  It was felt that there were likely no further
interventions possible on this patient given difficulties in
the catheterization state. She was continued on aspirin,
Plavix, atorvastatin, and Warfarin was initiated for
decreased ejection fraction of 25 percent with a target INR
of 2.

ENDOCRINE:  The patient is a type 1 diabetic and the morning
following her initial cardiac catheterization she refused her
insulin.  NOHA staff was notified and the patient
subsequently went into diabetic ketoacidosis. She was treated
in the Intensive Care Unit with insulin and fluids and
electrolytes and the acidosis rapidly resolved and she had no
further complications of diabetes during her hospital stay.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  In addition to the cardiac
catheterization as mentioned previously the patient had
several echocardiograms, the last of which was done on
[**1-26**], which was 3 days after her second cardiac
catheterization. This demonstrated moderately dilated left
ventricular cavity. Severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis with basal inferolateral akinesis, mid
inferolateral akinesis, and lateral apex was akinetic without
an effusion. 1+ mitral regurgitation and normal RV function.
The patient had a peak CK of 765 on [**1-24**] and chest
x-ray on [**1-25**], showed mild cardiomegaly and minimal
perihilar haziness in upper lobe redistribution.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Coronary artery disease, likely not amenable to further
intervention status post left anterior descending stents x 2.
2.  Congestive heart failure with ejection fraction 25
percent.
3.  Type 1 diabetes mellitus.
4.  Hypertension.
5.  Anticoagulation for low ejection fraction.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atorvastatin 10 mg po once daily
2.  Plavix 25 mg po once daily
3.  Pantoprazole 40 mg po once daily
4.  Aspirin 325 mg po once daily
5.  Metoprolol XL 12.5
6.  Warfarin 5 mg qhs [**1-29**] and [**1-30**] and then 2 mg thereafter to
have an INR  checked on [**2125-2-1**], targeting an INR of 2.0.
7.  Insulin NPH 18 units in the morning and 8 units in the
evening, Regular insulin sliding scale
8.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg po once daily.

FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS:
The patient has follow up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on
[**2-2**] and he should call her usual cardiologist for an
appointment within one to two weeks.
