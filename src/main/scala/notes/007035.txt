Chief Complaint:
bradycardia; initial c/o falls

Patient expired


History of Present Illness:
87 year old man with hypothyroidism, AR (2+), MR (1+), and 3
vessel coronary artery disease on cardiac cath ([**2181-7-15**]), who
recent mechanical falls. Over the last month, pt reports two
falls in the bathroom, reportedly mechanical, no LOC, no CP, or
palpitations. Pt does endorse lightheadedness, which has been
present for >1yr. At least on of the falls occurred while trying
to sit down on the toilet or while getting up. At PCPs office,
pt's SBP 78 & pt bradycardic. PCP sent pt to [**Hospital1 **] ER for
further eval. There, EKG showed sinus bradycardia (30??????s-40??????s).
Initial SBP 110-130s, HR 40-50s. Relevant labs include K 5.9,
trop 0.016, creat normal, Hct 37, and plt 47. He was treated
with Kayexalate. Pt transferred for EP eval of bradycardia.
.
Additional relevant history, pt reports over a year of shortness
of breath/DOE & lightheadedness. Was worked up in spring [**2181**] w/
CXR, which showed R sided infiltrates (CT recommended for
f/u--not yet done), stress echo, which was positive (see report
below), and cardiac cath, which showed 3VD. The patient opted to
not undergo CABG. He has had wt loss (unclear amount, though
thought to be >30lb over last yr). Pt also reports R groin pain
w/ ambulation over this time. Having significant diffiliculty
ambulating [**2-16**] SOB, lightheadedness, and R groin pain.

hemoptysis, black stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers,
chills or rigors. He denies exertional buttock or calf pain. All
of the other review of systems were negative.

CXR [**3-6**]:
Radiographic evidence of fibrotic lung disease associated with
traction
bronchiectasis, bibasilar  honeycombing and pleural fibrosis,
right more than left.  In addition, there is an unilateral
opacity seen in the right mid zone along with more opacification
seen at the right lower zone, worrisome for an acute on chronic
lung disease.  These findings necessitate further evaluation by
a chest CT, preferably a high-resolution chest CT scan
examination if the patient can tolerate the procedure, or if
not, then a standard chest CT scan examination.
.
CXR [**3-7**]:
Comparison with [**2182-3-6**].  Compared to the previous
exam, there is new consolidation in the right lower lung zone
and left lower lung zone.  The extensive pleural thickening,
bronchiectasis, and severe volume loss in the upper lobes is
unchanged.  Cardiac contour is difficult to assess due to
overlying lung parenchyma, however, mediastinal, and hilar
contours are probably similar.  Osseous structures are
unchanged.
.
EKG: Sinus rhythm with borderline 1st degree A-V block
Left ventricular hypertrophy


Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the cardiology floor and placed on
telemetry. EKG showed sinus bradycardia that over the course of
several hours trended to HR in 60s with 2 brief episodes of
bradycardia to 30s-40s with bowel movements, resolved before
intervention made. He initially had a SBP in low 100s, and was
given 1L IVFs over several hours. On the morning after
admission, the patient had a decrease in BP from SBPs in 90s,
100s to 60s-70s. Despite IVFs, he continued to be hypotensive,
requiring transfer to the ICU. His family and friends were
called and given severe lung disease and poor response to
resuscitation it was decided to pursue comfort measures and he
died on [**2182-3-7**].

Medications on Admission:
-Pt self reports heart medication taken twice daily (? pindolol,
which he has been on previously)
-Eye drops for glaucoma
-Milk of Mag PRN
He stated he was not taking levothyroxine/megace/other meds
previously prescribed
