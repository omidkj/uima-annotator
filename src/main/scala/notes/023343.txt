Chief Complaint:
Asymptomatic.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
S/p AVR(27mm Mosaic porcine valve)/Asc. aortic arch
replacement(28mm Gelweave graft) [**2121-4-24**]


History of Present Illness:
This 42WF has a h/o bicuspid aortic valve which was detected on
a chest xray.  She had an echo [**11-13**] which revealed a bicuspid
aortic valve, an ascending aorta of [**3-14**] cm , mild AI, and trace
MR.  A chest CT showed an ascending aorta of 5.2x5.1 cm.  She
now presents for ascending aorta replacement/AVR.

CHEST (PA & LAT)

Reason: evaluate effusion

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
42 year old woman s/p AVR Asc AO
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
evaluate effusion
HISTORY: 42-year-old woman status post AVR, ascending aorta
replacement.

COMPARISON: [**2121-4-25**].

CHEST, PA AND LATERAL: There is stable postoperative appearance
of the cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours. Pulmonary
vasculature is unremarkable. Tiny residual left pleural effusion
is stable. Osseous and soft tissue structures are unchanged.

IMPRESSION: Stable tiny left pleural effusion.

MEASUREMENTS:
Left Ventricle - Inferolateral Thickness: 1.1 cm (nl 0.6 - 1.1
cm)
Left Ventricle - Diastolic Dimension: 4.8 cm (nl <= 5.6 cm)
Left Ventricle - Ejection Fraction: 50% to 55% (nl >=55%)
Aorta - Ascending: *5.5 cm (nl <= 3.4 cm)
Aorta - Descending Thoracic: 2.4 cm (nl <= 2.5 cm)

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the LAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: PFO is present.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size.

LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal;
basal
anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal
inferoseptal - normal;
mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior
- normal;
basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal
anterolateral

septal apex -
normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex -
normal;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Markedly dilated ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in
descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Bicuspid aortic valve. Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE
related
complications. The TEE probe was passed with assistance from the

anesthesioology staff using a laryngoscope. The patient was
under general
anesthesia throughout the procedure. Results were personally
reviewed with the
MD caring for the patient.

Conclusions:
Pre-CPB: No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the left atrial
appendage. A
patent foramen ovale is present. Left ventricular wall
thicknesses, systolic
function and cavity size are normal. Right ventricular chamber
size and free
wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is markedly dilated,
with a
preserved sino-tubular junction. There are simple atheroma in
the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve is bicuspid. The mitral valve
leaflets are
mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no
pericardial
effusion.

Post-CPB: A well-seated and functioning aortic valve prosthesis
is in place.
No leak, no AI. Good biventricular systolic fxn. Descending
aorta intact.
Ascending aorta tube graft is noted. Other parameters as
pre-bypass.

Brief Hospital Course:
The pt. was admitted on [**2121-4-24**] and underwent AVR(27mm Mosaic
porcine valve)/replacement of ascending aorta/hemiarch(28mm
Gelweave graft).  The cross clamp time was 90 mins. and circ
arrest was 18 mins., total bypass time was 116 mins.
She was transferred to the CSRU in stable condition on Propofol
and was extubated on the post op night.  Her chest tubes were
d/c'd on POD#1 and she was transferred to the floor.  Her
epicardial pacing wires were d/c'd on  POD#3 and she was
discharged to home in stable condition on POD#4.
