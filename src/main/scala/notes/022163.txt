Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2167**]
Chief Complaint:
Bilateral leg edema

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PICC line placement and removal

History of Present Illness:
61 year old male with MMP including thrombophilia (multiple
PEs/DVTs s/p IVC filter), chronic systolic CHF, CAD s/p STEMI
[**10-1**], homeless with poor medication compliance, Munchenhausen
syndrome by reports, and PTSD who was discharged the day of
admission from [**Hospital **] Hospital and sent directly to [**Hospital 191**] clinic
for follow up with his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient states that he developed
worsening bilateral LE edema over 3-5 days while at [**Hospital1 **]. He
was progessively unable to walk due to pain in his legs.
Endorses bilateral swelling of legs and hands, as well as some
shortness of breath. He endorses stuttering intermittent
episodes of chest pain which last a few minutes, resolve
spontaneously, and can radiate under his left arm. He
occasionally becomes diaphoretic after these episodes. No
nausea. No fevers but occasional sweats as above. No vomiting of
diarrhea. The patient states that he had a scan at [**Hospital **]
Hospital which showed a clot in his legs. He was referred to the
[**Hospital1 18**] ED by his PCP for evaluation of edema, r/o DVT.

In the ED, he was afebrile, BP: 130/90 P: 80s RR: 16 Sat:
97-100%RA. On exam, no crackles, but wheezing diffusely. + LE
edema in both legs, appears red but not felt to be cellulitic.
Labs revealed mildly elevated potassium and proBNP 2479. CEs
were negative x 2. EKG showeed old anteroseptal MI but no acute
ischemic changes. CXR without overt CHF but + mild vascular
congestion. Bilateral LE U/S were negative for DVT. He received
kayexalate, ASA, and 20mg IV lasix, admitted for CHF
exacerbation.


Past Medical History:
- Anti-social personality disorder
- s/p STEMI w/ BMS in LAD in [**10-1**], due to GI bleed stopped
plavix cont only aspiring
- Malignant hypertension: thought to be secondary to medication

non-compliance, but had hypotension during recent admission in
[**10-31**] and BP meds were cut back. (most likely due to Clonidine
effect: overdose/withdrawal)
- Pulmonary embolus: Recurrent [**Month/Year (2) 11011**] s/p IVC filter, not on
coumadin due to noncompliance
- Heroin abuse: methadone maintenance clinic [**Street Address(2) 11016**]
daily at 7AM (most recent daily dose on [**Month (only) 462**] 135 mg daily.

- Hepatitis B previous infection, now sAg negative
- Hepatitis C, undetectable HCV RNA [**3-29**]
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease
- PTSD ([**Country 3992**] veteran)
- Anxiety / Depression
- Antisocial personality disorder
- Microcytic anemia
- Vitamin B12 deficiency
- Chronic kidney disease baseline Cr 1.5

[**Country 3992**] veteran. Past heroin abuse, now on methadone. On
disability.

LOWER EXTREMITY DOPPLERS ([**2108-12-18**]): No DVT identified in the
right or left lower extremity.

CTA CHEST ([**2108-12-21**]): 1. No pulmonary embolism to the
subsegmental level. 2. Multifocal peribronchial and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]
opacities, likely due to
multifocal infection. Bronchial wall thickening suggests
associated
bronchitis. 3. Mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy.
4. Bilateral gynecomastia, slightly asymmetric to the left,
should be
correlated with clinical information. 5. Coronary artery
calcifications and stent. 6. Fatty atrophy of the pancreas.
Splenomegaly.

MRI ABDOMEN AND PELVIS ([**2108-12-21**]): 1. Extensive thrombosis of
the inferior vena cava, extending from the level of the inferior
vena cava filter inferiorly into the common iliac vein on the
left and through the external iliac vein on the right. 2. Mild
splenomegaly. 3. Moderate to severe L1 compression fracture with
retropulsion into the spinal canal. If clinically indicated, a
lumbar MRI would provide superior evaluation.

CT SINUS ([**2108-12-27**]): No evidence of sinusitis.

TTE ([**2108-12-21**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with distal LV/apical akinesis. The
remaining semgents are hyperdynamic. A moderate to large mural
thrombus is seen in the left ventricular apex. There is no
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly
dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. Compared with the
prior study (images reviewed) of [**2108-12-3**], an LV apical
thrombus is now apparent.

CHEST RADIOGRAPH ([**2108-12-30**]): The coarse reticular abnormality at
the medial aspect of the right lung base is probably residual
from pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage in [**Month (only) **]. Upper lungs
are clear aside from mild vascular engorgement. Heart size is
top normal. There is no pleural effusion. There are no findings
of central adenopathy seen on the prior study. Mild indentation
of the trachea in the neck could be due to enlarged thyroid.

Brief Hospital Course:
61M with recent STEMI status-post BMS to LAD, chronic systolic
CHF, and DVT/PE s/p IVC filter admitted [**2108-12-18**] with
bilateral lower extremity edema. Initially transferred to MICU
from the floor for management of hypotension and hypoxia of
unknown source; observed and transferred back to floor for
further management. Hospital course was as follows.
     On morning of admission, patient received his usual
Clonazepam 2 mg and Methadone 135 mg AM. Shortly thereafter he
was found to be slightly cyanotic with O2 saturation near 80%
and blood pressure to 82/palpable. ABG showed 7.33/59/50.
Patient was placed on NRB with subsequent ABG 7.33/56/76,
lactate 0.7. Patient was started on heparin gtt given concern
for pulmonary embolism. He was guiac negative with no hidden
medications found (history of hiding medications). Patient was
transfered to the ICU for hypotension a
