Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1943**]
Chief Complaint:
Hypotension

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation [**2121-1-10**]

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man with a history of hep B cirrhosis and HCC s/p
chemo embolization, RFA x 3, hx of LGIB from ?rectal varices and
hemorrhoids, known esophageal varices, s/p post-pyloric feeding
tube placement due to concern about aspiration and poor po
intake, recently discharged from the liver-kidney service on
[**2120-1-3**] for post-pyloric NG tube re-placement but he passed S/S
so he went to rehab taking PO. Today he presents to the ED with
hypotension.

Per family, the patient has been doing well since discharge at
his rehab facility. Today had a 'normal day' per his daughter
until after lunch when he complained of dizziness. His BP was
checked at this time and SBP 77, and the MD at rehab felt that
he appeared dry so sent him to the ED for eval. Per family's
report the patient denied any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever,
abdominal pain, dysuria. There was no report of BRBPR or melena.


In the ED, the patient's VS were rectal temp of 33 and BP 80/60.
Labs notable for HCT 20.7 (from 25), platelets 36 (from 60),
albumin 1.5, T. Bili 2.0, sodium of 160, BUN/creatinine 91/3.7,
INR 2.3 (from 1.8), lactate of 4.

He complained of some abdominal pain and he had guaiac positive
brown stool. He was initially given 2L IVF without any change in
his SBP so peripheral levophed was started and labs were
checked. His HCT returned at 20 (recent baseline of 24-25) with
platelets of 36 and his sodium was 160. He was then given 2
units of emergency blood (uncrossmatched) and 2 more units of
crossmatched blood (HCT 20--27--32--33.4). After this his SBP
increased to the low 100s, but then decreased again to the 70s.
A Right IJ was placed and neo was started in addition to levo
and his BP came up to the 90-100s.

FAST exam showed trace effusion, diffuse hypokinesis. Trop 0.08,
EKG looked "ok". No aspirin because concern of bleeding. Dx
paracentesis was done that showed 154 WBC with 74% polys. CT
Torso was then performed which showed ?multifocal pneumonia
without other intrabdominal pathology. Per ED resident, GI and
liver consult were called but did not feel the patient's
presentation was consistent with a variceal bleed so he is not
on protonix or octreotide. OG tube lavage not done.

At some point during his course downstairs the patient was
intubated for unclear reasons (?AMS). His ABG on fIo2 100%, PEEP
of 5, rate of 14 was 7.36/38/117. Per ED resident, the family
wanted the patient to be DNR/DNI but patient was asked and
wanted to be full code.

Vitals on transfer: 34.9 106/60 80 14 100% on Vent fIo2 100%,
PEEP of 5 rate of 14 AC. Neo at 2, Levophed at 0.12. 6.5L NS,
CVP 11, SV02 80s.

He has had multiple recent admissions at [**Hospital1 18**], from
[**Date range (2) 35671**] with hypotension and worsening liver failure
complicated by ascites and LE edema; also from [**2120-12-11**] to
[**2120-12-18**] for BRBPR with no source of bleeding found and then from
[**12-28**] to [**2121-1-1**] because his NG tube became dislodged and needed
to be replaced. He was transfused 1 unit of PRBCs for low HCT.
According the the discharge summary "on this admission after
discussion with pt and daughter, code status was DNR DNI. This
should be revisited with pt and family on future admissions
because due to language barriers and the family's changing
perspective on the pt's health status, the code status often
changes."

STUDIES:
[**1-10**] EKG: Probable atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response. Poor baseline. The limb leads are reversed. Suggest
repeat tracing. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2120-12-14**]
atrial fibrillation is new.

[**1-10**] CXR: Diffuse interstitial edema is evident with significant
worsening in the fluid balance relative to the prior exam. Lung
volumes are diminished especially on the left with marked
elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  Aortic tortuosity is again
noted although accentuated by rotation. The cardiac silhouette
size is stable. A right pleural effusion has developed. There is
likely left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax is noted. A right
external jugular peripheral catheter is identified in the left
neck.  Degenerative changes are seen throughout the thoracic
spine and in bilateral shoulder joints. Clips are identified
over the right upper quadrant.

IMPRESSION: Volume overload. Recommend repeat radiography after
appropriate diuresis to assess for underlying infection.

[**2121-1-11**] TTE: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved
global and regional biventricular systolic function. Mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mildly dilated thoracic
aorta.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-11-8**],
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher and a
left pleural effusion is now apparent.

[**2121-1-11**] CT CHEST/ABD/PELVIS: 1. Multifocal pneumonia. 2.
Pulmonary edema and bilateral effusions. 3. Distended
gallbladder with cholelithiasis. Evaluation of the gallbladder
is limited on this non-contrast-enhanced technique and in the
setting of large volume ascites. Recommend clinical correlation
and abdominal ultrasound could be obtained if there is concern
for acute cholecystitis. 4. Cirrhotic liver and large volume
ascites. 5. Recommend advancement of orogastric tube.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] yo m with hx of Hep B, cirrhosis, and HCC, presented to ER
with AMS and hypotension, treated in the MICU but eventually
made CMO.

# Goals of care: Family initially decided the pt is DNR/DNI with
no escalation of care.  However after a family meeting with the
medical team, this was changed to CMO and do-not-rehospitalize.
The family requests that he compete his antibiotic course
