Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 1406**]
Chief Complaint:
Shortness of breath and chest discomfort

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2175-6-19**] Cardiac Catherization
[**2175-6-26**] Three Vessel Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting(left
internal mammary to left anterior descending artery with
saphenous vein grafts to diagonal and PDA).


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 86418**] is a 78 year-old man with a history of inferior MI,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and claudication who was
admitted to the CCU following emergent cardiac catheterization
after presenting with acute onset shortness of breath and chest
discomfort. He is a vague historian although does feel that he
has been more fatigued in general over the last 2-3 weeks with
shortness of breath noticed when it was hot and humid. He
noticed he has felt more short of breath since the evening prior
to admission ([**6-18**]) and first noticed this when he was tryng to
go to sleep. He was restless and felt that his breathing was
labored at rest. He also notes epigastric/lower chest discomfort
which was continuous since the evening of [**6-18**] and was a dull
pain which had no particular radiation and was assocated with
some chest heaviness. He denied significant nausea, no vomiting
although he was diaphoretic.
.
His symptoms were considerably worse by the morning of [**6-19**] and
he called EMS and was admitted to the outside hospital ([**Hospital1 **]) ED and ECG at the time showed a LBBB and inferior Q
waves and CXR showed pulmonary edema and cardiac enzymes were
mildly elevated with Trop 0.12, BNP 3490. Baseline labs at
[**Hospital3 **] showed BUN 41 Cr 1.4.
.
In the [**Hospital 97437**] Hospital ED, he was loaded with clopidogrel 600mg
and 4x81mg aspirin and integrilin infusion at 14ml/hour and a
nitroglycerin 50mcg/min infusion. On arrival at [**Hospital3 **] ED
he received furosemide 40mg IV and taken to cardiac
catheterization. Cardiac cath demonstrated diffuse 3-vessel
disease not amenable to PCI.
.
On review of systems, he denied any recent fever, chills, change
in weight, change to bowel or bladder habbits, arthalgia,
myaglia, dizziness, numbness or weakness. Cardiac review of
systems is notable for absence of typical chest pain, although
he was dyspneic at rest, had no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope. He
noted bilateral claudication at 200yrds with no rest pain. Of
note he had dark/black stools for three days and settled two
days ago. He has chronic problems with increased urinary
frequency/urgency.

[**2175-6-19**] Cardiac Cath:
1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed two vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had mild
diffuse disease.
The LAD had serial 90% stenoses, including near the ostium. The
Lcx had
moderate diffuse disease. The RCA (engaged with AL1) was totally

occluded and filled distally via left to right collaterals.
2. Resting hemodyanmics revealed severely elevated filling
pressures
with RVEDP of 23 and LVEDP of 39 mmHg. There was severe
pulmonary
hypertension with PASP of 50/31 mmHg. There was preserved
cardiac index
of 2.7 L/min/m2. There was a 20mmHg gradient across the aortic
valve,
which was confirmed on LV pullback, consistent with aortic
stenosis.
[**2175-6-19**] Echocardiogram:
The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely
depressed (LVEF= 25-30 %) with global hypokinesis and regional
inferior, lateral and apical near akinesis. There is no
ventricular septal defect. with borderline normal free wall
function. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
probably moderate to severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
0.8-1.0cm2) (low output AS). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen.
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The pulmonary
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.
[**2175-6-20**] Carotid Ultrasound:
Right ICA stenosis 60-69%. Left ICA stenosis <40%.
[**2175-6-26**] Intraop Echocardiogram:
PREBYPASS
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with thinning and akinesis
of the inferior, inferoseptal walls. There is hypokinesis of the
inferolateral wall.. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. There are complex (mobile) atheroma in the
ascending aorta as demonstrated by an epiaortic scan. There are
complex (mobile) atheroma in the aortic arch. There are multiple
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The
aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened with decreased
mobility of the left and non coronary cusps.. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8- 0.9 cm2). Peak/mean
gradient is 25/15 mm Hg. Given the patients low CI of 1.5, this
may represent pseudo-aortic stenosis. Dobuatmine testing of this
hypothesis was not performed. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to
moderate ([**12-3**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

POSTBYPASS
The patient is receiving dobutamine 5 ucg/kg/min
LV systolic function appears slightly improved in the setting of
inotropes. There is slight improvement of the anterior and
lateral walls. The AV
