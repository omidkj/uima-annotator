Chief Complaint:
Confusion, Poor PO intake, [**Last Name (un) **], Hyperkalemia, UTI

none


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 12101**] is a 69-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. significant
for IDDM, bladder cancer s/p cystectomy with ileal conduit
creation in [**9-3**], COPD, HTN, and hyperlipidemia who presents to
the ED after his daughter found him confused and hallucinating
at home.
.
According to patient, he has felt "not-himself" for the past 3
weeks.  During this time, he complains of erratic blood sugars,
increased pain in his back, and worsening infection of his feet.
 He has also started falling during this time: the most recent
episode was the day before admission while he was taking
communion.  Patient states that when he falls, he doesn't feel
lightheaded or dizzy, but his legs just "give out."  He denies
any head trauma with these episodes.  According to the patient's
daughter, she is worried that Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 12101**] isn't taking care of
himself anymore at home.  Daughter found patient at home acting
strangely, and called [**Company 191**] to complain of erratic behavior;
daughter was told to bring patient into the ED.  Of note,
patient has had multiple admissions for hypoglycemia.  However,
his sugars have been running high over the past few days (in the
400s), and he was told by his PCP to increase insulin dosage
from 12 to 15 units/day.  He uses a pre-filled pen for
injections.
.
In the ED, initial VS were:  97.4 104 115/53 20 96%. UA was
positive and he was given Cipro 400mg IV x1. Vanc also given for
? cellulitis in lower extremity. His blood sugar was 511 with
anion gap 14, so DKA diagnosed and insulin gtt started. His K+
was 6.6, with peaked T waves on EKG; he was given calcium
gluconate and kayexalate in addition to the insulin gtt. He was
also given 1 liter of normal saline.  Upon admission to the
MICU, vitals were: afebrile, BP: 140/74, HR: 69, SP02 100% on
RA.  C-collar was removed as no evidence of fracture on CT.
Insulin drip was continued and labs were rechecked.

EKG
The underlying rhythm is likely sinus with intra-atrial
conduction abnormality. Low QRS voltage in the limb leads.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2153-12-30**] R wave progression
has improved in the precordial leads and the rate is faster
.
HEAD CT WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: No intra- or extra-axial
hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of midline structures is
demonstrated. Confluent  periventricular and subcortical white
matter hypodensities are again demonstrated in the cerebral
hemispheres bilaterally most likely compatible with chronic
microvascular infarction. Punctate hypodensities within the
basal ganglia bilaterally likely reflect chronic lacunar
infarcts as well as within the right caudate head. Widening of
the ventricles and sulci bilaterally is compatible with
age-appropriate involutional change. Opacification of the right
mastoid air cells suggests an ongoing inflammatory process.
Minimal opacification of an inferior mastoid air cell on the
left is also noted. The paranasal sinuses are clear. Surrounding
osseous and soft tissue structures are otherwise unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.
.
CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: No
fracture, change in alignment, or prevertebral soft tissue
swelling is demonstrated. There are multilevel degenerative
changes identified, worst at C6/7 where posterior osteophyte
results in moderate canal narrowing. There is bilateral moderate
to severe neural foraminal narrowing present at this level as
well. Mild grade 1 retrolisthesis of C5 on C6 is unchanged.
Ossification of the nuchal ligament is noted posterior to C6.
Carotid vascular calcifications are most pronounced at the
bifurcations bilaterally. Surrounding soft tissue structures
otherwise are unremarkable. A vascular [**Date Range **] is noted within the
proximal right subclavian artery, and is partially imaged.
Severe emphysematous changes are noted within the lung apices.
Ossification of the right mastoid air cell suggests ongoing
inflammation.
.
IMPRESSION: No acute fracture or subluxation. Moderate cervical
spondylosis, worst at C6/7 with moderate central canal narrowing
and moderate to severe bilateral neural foraminal narrowing.
Emphysema within the lung apices.
.
PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: Patient is status post median
sternotomy and CABG. Vascular [**Date Range **] is noted within the right
subclavian artery. Heart size is normal. Coronary arterial
vascular [**Date Range **] is also demonstrated. The mediastinal and hilar
contours are unchanged. The pulmonary vascularity is normal.
There is hyperinflation of the lungs with attenuation of the
pulmonary vascular markings towards the apices, compatible with
emphysema. Minimal interstitial opacities are seen predominantly
within th
